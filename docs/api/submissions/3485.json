{"id": 3485, "submission_id": "z7bax1", "title": "AITA for asking my sister if my daughter could stay in her \"cat room\" ?", "selftext": "I (31M) and my daughters, Sally and Mia (4F & 7F) went to go visit my sister, Alice (27F), for Thanksgiving on Saturday (we used to have it at my parents house, but they didn't want to do it this year).\n\nFor context, Alice has a very large, 4 bedroom house that she shares with her cat, Orpheus. She turned one of the larger extra rooms (not a bedroom) into a cat room for Orpheus.\n\nIt's huge, there's adorable decorations everywhere, large windows, and a very comfy couch. She named Orpheus after some Greek hero, I'm not really sure what the tale was, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with music, based off of the decorations. She also has some more fragile decorations around, a few statues and a glass figurine.\n\nAnyways, me and my parents came over, and she gave one room to our parents, one for me and my wife, and one for the girls. At first the girls were okay with this arrangement, since they're both pretty small, but after seeing the cat room, Sally wanted to sleep in there.\n\nI brought it up to Alice and she said that would absolutely not be happening. I asked her why, and she told me that she didn't want Sally to be alone and unsupervised with all of her fragile decorations.\n\nI think that's ridiculous. The room is for a cat. How is my daughter more destructive than a cat? Alice just said that Orpheus never went near the shelves that the figurines were placed on (the shelves are pretty low and Sally could probably reach them if she tried).\n\nNow Sally won't stop making a fit about it, and when I asked Alice to just be accommodating, she told me that I was Sally's parent, and I should be responsible for making sure she understands \"no\". AITA for asking her? I just don't think Alice has a particularly good reason for denying it. It's a CATS room.", "created_utc": 1669675611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7bax1/aita_for_asking_my_sister_if_my_daughter_could/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not for asking, but for not accepting her answer. Doesn't matter if you agree with her reasoning or not, it's not up for discussion. \n\nSis is right. You *are the parent.* You need to explain to your kids that they don't get everything they want.", "YTA; her house, her rules. And for the record, a child is *far* more destructive than a cat.", "YTA. It's her house, she can decide whether to let someone sleep in the cat room and she said no. instead of admonishing your sister, how about you teach your daughter that you can't always get what you want?", "Yta. It's a cats room in her house, not yours. Idc if it's a room  dedicated to the ancient gods of ant poop, she gets to make the calls for it.", "YTA. You\u2019re guests.

Her house, her rules.", "YTA and your sister is right.  Sally needs to learn what \"no\" means, and you need to learn how to say it.", "YTA. It's not a guest room. It belongs to a permanent occupant of that house, and the owner of the house told you NO. No is a full sentence.\n\nIt is up to you to parent your children, and to respect your sister in her own home.", "YTA, teach your child some manners. It doesn't matter what the room is, be it a cat's room, a BDSM dungeon, or just a big barren room with a single raisin in it. It is not for you to decide what is and isn't an acceptable use for it. Your spawn is not a factor in this.", "YTA\n\nIt's your sister's house, and her cat is like her child. Either comply with her wishes or leave. She's being generous enough already and you have no right to make even more demands of her when she's already been so accommodating. Respect her boundaries or get out.", "It's a cat's room in your SISTER'S house. Not yours. You don't get to decide. Your sister probably knows her cat won't wreck her stuff because he hasn't in the past, which is why the decorations are even in that room and not elsewhere. Your kid is inevitably going to want to play with the pretty figurines and at 4 years old won't understand how to keep fragile things from breaking. Which is an excellent reason not to let the kid anywhere near them.\n\nYour sister is 100% right. It is your job to parent your kid and stop her throwing fits when she doesn't get what she wants. How is it not a red flag to you that your kid is throwing tantrums at hearing 'no'? How is your only solution trying to force your sister into saying yes? \n\nGrow up. Be a parent. YTA", "YTA.

There was nothing wrong with asking, but your refusal to accept no as an answer and sitting here whining about it and trying to manipulate Alice into changing her mind makes you the asshole. \n\nYTA And Alice is going to end up being an asshole like you when she's older if you don't teach her that no means no. If she's having a fit over this and your way of dealing with it is trying to force your sister to cave, chances are you're not doing a great job parenting her properly.", "YTA. It's Alice's home, and she gave a reasonable explanation for why it's not a guest room (it's not even set up with a bed). Both girls had a room to stay in anyway and were perfectly happy to share. You'd better accept Alice's decision before your chances of being invited back are like Eurydice's chances of returning to the land of the living.\n\nOrpheus is best known for trying to get his wife Eurydice from the Underworld.

It is her home and she has graciously provided two rooms for you and you kids to sleep in.  \n\nSome people dont want visitors in their library, or office.  She doesnt want your child in her cat's room. The respectful and polite thing to do is respect this boundary.  Her reason for not wanting your daughter in there makes sense, but even if it didn't, its her house, her choice. It doubly a good idea for your daughter not to be in the cat room, because as stubborn and unreasonable as you are,  if she allowed your daughter in there and she broke something, you would not want to pay for it and say \"kids will be kids\", or \"you shouldnt have breakable things in a cats room\" or some other bs and say its no big deal.  \n\nThe figurines matter to the owner of the house, she wants to be cautious.  You should accept that. She is not being rude (you are), she established sensible boundaries, which you argue to disregard.\n\nIt wont harm your daughter in any way to not sleep in the cat room.

One for her, one for your parents, one for you and your wife, one for your kids. The cat does not have a bedroom. So there is no bed or anything like that in its room. Is your sister also supposed to move the furniture from the bedroom to the cat room to be \"accommodating\"?\n\n\"No\" is a full sentence. You don't need to accept her reason as a valid answer that suits you. It's her house, you're the guest, and she accommodated everyone with their own rooms. You don't even have to sleep in the same room as your kids, so you get to have some privacy. \n\nLearn to take a no, and teach your kid to take a no. And learn to dial down the condescension.

She turned one of the larger extra rooms (not a bedroom) into a cat room for Orpheus.\n\nIt's huge, there's adorable decorations everywhere, large windows, and a very comfy couch. She named Orpheus after some Greek hero, I'm not really sure what the tale was, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with music, based off of the decorations. She also has some more fragile decorations around, a few statues and a glass figurine.\n\nAnyways, me and my parents came over, and she gave one room to our parents, one for me and my wife, and one for the girls. At first the girls were okay with this arrangement, since they're both pretty small, but after seeing the cat room, Sally wanted to sleep in there.\n\nI brought it up to Alice and she said that would absolutely not be happening. I asked her why, and she told me that she didn't want Sally to be alone and unsupervised with all of her fragile decorations.\n\nI think that's ridiculous. The room is for a cat. How is my daughter more destructive than a cat? Alice just said that Orpheus never went near the shelves that the figurines were placed on (the shelves are pretty low and Sally could probably reach them if she tried).\n\nNow Sally won't stop making a fit about it, and when I asked Alice to just be accommodating, she told me that I was Sally's parent, and I should be responsible for making sure she understands \"no\". AITA for asking her? I just don't think Alice has a particularly good reason for denying it. It's a CATS room.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA, op", "I sell fragile things for a living. I also have 2 cats. In all the years I've had them, they've only broken one thing,  and it was because one cat got startled and jumped. \n\nNormally they will carefully maneuver around everything. Watch the videos online of cats walking around glassware. It is amazing. \n\nI never understand the jokes about cats purposely knocking things over. I've not ever witnessed that. Yet, I've had plenty of kids look me straight in the eye and drop their toy/fork/binky/food/etc on the floor.", "Yes. If all 3 of younwere crammed in 1 room and it was you or  the 7 year old who could move to the cats room, thats different.

So in the end we stopped putting up a real one. She had no problem with a plastic one.\n\nThe other wasn't destructive, just a thief. She kept stealing my steak. And I litterlry mean \"my\" steak.

Never learned why.", "Took the words right out of my mouth.\n\nYTA", "Oh sorry Sally is already an asshole thanks to the parenting. She is 4.

It was nice not having cat hair everywhere, but I missed having the cats sleep next to my legs. So here we go again. Hair everywhere, but it warms my heart when they come to sleep next to me.", "Depends on the child then really", "Yeah given that my cats are Artemis and Apollo I read that and was dying inside.", "That made me laugh!

This seems like a great opportunity to teach Sally about 1. Boundaries. 2. Courtesy when a guest in someone else\u2019s home and 3. We don\u2019t always get what we want. Sounds like you need a refresher course on those boundaries as well, Dad.\n\nAnd Sally is four. She is absolutely destructive. Not in a mean way, but coordination and impulse control are still developing and she\u2019s at that age where she could love a small animal to death.

Your child saw another room and wanted it, your sister said no. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the cat room, the sewing room, or blank walls. She said no.

All you\u2019re doing is teaching your kids to whine until they get their way. Your sister wasn\u2019t mean about it, she explained her reasoning with pure logic and you won\u2019t shut up about it. \n\nBe a parent and explain to your kid some times we can\u2019t do the things we want to out of respect for others.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA", "YTA.

Your children are not alway entitled to get what they want!", "YTA- You are not entitled to ANY space inside your sister's home. Your sister has a 4-bedroom house, you and your wife got one, your children got one, and your parents got one, that leaves ONE bedroom for the person LIVING in the house and another room for her companion. Since you can't seem to just tell your kid no, maybe try this instead; \"Sally, that room is not a bedroom, it is a room just for Orpheus. But isn't this room your Aunt Alice sat up for you and sister so neat? I'd love to sleep in there!\" If the fit persists; \"I understand that you're upset Sally but that is a kitty room not a kiddy room and there is nothing to be done.\" Simply parenting your child would solve ALL of this. And you owe your sister an apology because she has been more than accommodating by even letting you, your wife and your spawn to stay in your own rooms in her house. If I were Alice this would be the last time your family stayed with me because you are teaching your children to be boundary stompers, which makes you all uncomfortable to be around.", "Yta not bc you asked. Asked is fine. But bc you won't accept a 'no'.  Do you know what it is when someone 'asks' something but won't accept a 'no'.  It's not an ask, it's a demand.\n\nYour sis is 1000000% right. It's you JOB as a parent to teach your kid to accept a no.  Based on her 'throwing a fit' do you ever say no to her? Or do you say no, she throws a tantrum,  and you give in. A+ parenting /s", "I think you need to learn about boundaries. Big time. I used to be one that didn't have boundaries at all. And when people insisted and kept going on and on of I said no, I would cave. And then I would go on to regret giving in when something got broke, or things turned out exactly like I knew they would. \n\nYTA, BUT if you can learn to respect boundaries and understand no means no, you would be doing everyone a favor, including you. And respect your daughter! You'll be teaching her that sometimes you can't just get what you want and it's ok to be a little upset by it, but you have to accept no as the answer. \n\nSo, grow and be a better person. Maybe your daughter can spend some time with the cat in his room, under supervision.

There was always one who is a chonker (18lbs) who loved sleeping in bed with me and would lay right by my face like she was a pillow. But luckily, I live with both of my parents and my sister and I'm the only one who keeps their door shut. I don't have much choice unfortunately. Even on 2 allergy medications my nose is permanently stuffy. But I still leave my room and play with them and give them attention all the time! Every day when I shower the youngest (1y/o 1mo) goes running into the bathroom to just be there. He used to get wet food when he was a wee lil boy, but he no longer does. He just enjoys the bathroom now I think. Cats are amazing to have around, they just spark so much joy in me.", "You could try giving the cats a food that reduces the allergens they produce, that might help with your symptoms.\nhttps://www.purina.com/pro-plan/cats/liveclear-cat-allergen-reducing-food\nAltough I am not sure if all 6 cats will take liking to it\n\nAlso there is supposed to be a new vaccine against cat allergy out next year. Might be worth looking into."]}
