{"id": 10747, "submission_id": "11a797w", "title": "AITA for wanting my bio parents to come to me if they want to meet me?", "selftext": "I(21M) was born in the U.S but I was adopted as a baby by my parents who are from Thailand and I've lived there my whole life. I'm very lucky because my life is great here I have a great English tutoring job, a great family my parents and my little sister and also an amazing wife(21F) and twin daughters.\n\n Recently through Facebook my bio parents reached out to me I don't know how they found me but they did. They said they would really like to meet me and for me to meet their kids in the U.S. I've honestly feared this day my whole life because I didn't know how I would respond so I talked to my wife and family to see what I should do. I decided that if they wanted to meet me they would have to come to Thailand instead of me going there because they were the ones who gave me up so if they really wanted to have a relationship with me that would help prove that they actually wanted to.\n\nI won't lie it would be expensive to get here there flights are about  1,500 USD each so $3,000 if my bio parents just come or  $7,500 my bio sibling come as well. Which they said they couldn't afford and it would be cheaper for me to come them which is true but I want them to make the effort not me because I have a family and it's not them. \n\nThen I get a message from what I guess is my bio aunt cussing at me about how I should just fly to the U.S to meet my \"real\" family and that way I could be \"where I belong\". I asked her want she meant by that and she went on about it's where my \"real\" family is and how America would be a better place to be than Thailand because it's a third world country. Which made me pretty mad so I told her that if she thought the U.S was a better place for why didn't she adopt me instead and some other things. Then my bio parents got angry and started messaging me about that and so I just stopped talking to them for now. \n\nNow she wasn't wrong about Thailand technically being a third world country but I've been to the U.S once a year and half ago with my little sister and wife. I personally think Thailand is a better country for me even though I'm not originally from here it's the place I was to be. Especially now that I have kids because it's a lot cheaper here for example I make 1,250,000 Baht which is only 36,000 USD a year which isn't a lot in the U.S but here it is for example I can get a 1kg of Chicken for about 86 Baht(2.50 USD) and then our house which is 4 bedroom 4 bath with a nice pool only cost 5.6 million Baht(162,000 USD). Then biggest thing is healthcare since we have kids and healthcare here is either  free or extremely cheap compared to the U.S so I have no reason to live where I \"belong\". \n\nI think I'm in the right for wanting my bio parents/family to come here instead of me going there even though it cost more for them but I don't know.

How will it change your life? What if they turn out to be unpleasant? And so on.  Shame on them that they barged in like that without giving you the chance to go through the process.

You are with your real family. Your bio family are strangers who know nothing about you or your life. If they want to meet you they can make the effort to fly over to do so. You owe them nothing. If they continue to be unpleasant block them and just keep living your best life. You thrived without them and can continue to do so.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA on this one. Yeah, it\u2019s expensive. But they\u2019re expecting you to take on that expense? The child they adopted out?\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the Bio-aunt. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s just some entitlement racism combo.\n\nYou have every right to not want to go and pay for the flight. If they\u2019re so desperate to meet the child they didn\u2019t raise, they can save up. Meanwhile you can enjoy your family, the ones who raised you, and the ones who love you dearly.", "Woow NTA and not a very impressive bio fam introduction. Screw them.", "Nta they don\u2019t sound like nice people why are you wanting your kids to be exposed to that when you say yourself your adoptive family are nice people. Just to meet the people who gave you up and then have the nerve to be rude to you and entitled? You really want them around your kids? For what?", "You don't have to justify the reasons as to why you prefer living in Thailand.\n\nNTA, your real family is the one that was there for you from the beginning and raised you.

Just talk before they invited you or was it just 'hello I'm your parent. Come to US and visit us?'. Maybe if you want to build a conection with them, video chats would be the first step to get to know each other before someone takes such a long trip.\n\nBut if you don't want anything to do with them - which would be completly understandable after they cussed you - don't talk to them. You own them nothing.", "NTA.\n\nmeeting your biological parents is a big deal and a tough decision to make as it is - if your parents are that desperate to meet you, the money won\u2019t matter to them and they\u2019ll come to you.\n\nyou seem to have a wonderful, fulfilling life where you are now, regardless of whether your AH aunt thinks you\u2019d be better elsewhere. you shouldn\u2019t have to justify why you\u2019re happy to stay where you are to them or anyone else !", "Thailand is your home -they had no right to disparaged it in an attempt to manipulate you into doing what they want - which is you travel here and meet them.  Whether it is right or wrong to say come to me or them say the same - not sure about that one.  Just because it is cheaper for your airfare does not mean it will be cheaper for a motel here or food daily, etc.  Only the flight will be cheaper.  I would wager they want you to come here for more than a day or two and that also means your kids would be out of school/daycare and upset their schedules.\n\nSo, it could be actually cheaper for them to visit you - the flight would be expensive (but if they planned it right and asked for discounts), they could negotiate a lower price.  The hotel, food and transportation would be cheaper in Thailand than here.  Also, you have a wife and 2 young kids, so traveling with kids would be harder.  Leaning much more to NTAH", "NTA at ALL. \n\nHonestly after the bio aunt reaching out angrily and spewing some pretty typical intolerant American shit, i would say to go with your gut. I\u2019m American but I really try my best to be tolerant and inclusive and informed on social issues etc, but there is a large population of Americans that are NOT like that. And being that you\u2019ve been raised in a different country and their family/your bio family view is limited enough to think, let alone VOICE that they look down upon where you were raised, is not a great indication of tolerance and acceptance. \n\nI mention this because I\u2019m sure you look like them, (sad that that\u2019s even a factor but ultimately that\u2019s the world we live in, that people care about that) but sound to be someone who was brought up with great moral character and love and, so in that way they seem to be different from you. But also I don\u2019t know where your family in Thailand would stand in your bio fam\u2019s eyes, given that from this post, at LEAST bio aunt sounds intolerant and ignorant as hell. \n\nI wonder if you know where they are from in the states, if you\u2019re considering visiting it might even be worth some light research of their area. In the US especially today, the divide politically is HUGE and I personally feel that it is tied to a lot of social issues that people in power have made political, and both sides find the other to just be wrong. Typically democratic side is more passionate about racial equality/representation and the same for LGBTQ+, although I\u2019m sure people would argue me on that. Ofc there is overlap and nuance but with the tangled web of social issues, religion, political leanings etc SO intertwined and with all of the lines blurred, it might be worth looking into. I\u2019m  currently living in NY, so it\u2019s not as bad here, but there are places in the states where people are stuck on very old fashioned ideals based on culture or religion usually, and also are unaware of their immense privilege, and it causes a lot of problems. I only mention this because if you were to meet them and go to their area, these are things you should be aware of in general but especially if you plan on bringing family from Thailand. \n\nIt also hopefully explains some of their ignorant viewpoint on you remaining in Thailand, where it sounds like you have a beautiful life built. I can tell you rn that the vast majority of 21 year olds here are not married, most do not have kids, most barely have an SO. I have literally never met a 21 year old here that owns their own home, let alone a 4 bed 4 bath with a pool. So hopefully that eases some of the hurt that their words may have caused you, or any questions their words may have potentially put into your head about where you should be living. \n\nI started reading this post already leaning NTA, and thinking it was possible nobody was the AH. I was thinking if you DID agree to travel to them bc they\u2019d have to pay more, then maybe it would be a good compromise to meet them in the US like they\u2019re asking, but to have them pay for your ticket as a show of good faith. However as I continued reading, it really sounds like they are some of the more brainwashed American species. I won\u2019t pretend like I myself am super informed on life in Thailand (or anywhere really) as I am in the US, but I don\u2019t talk out of my ass as if I am. I no longer believe that the US is just the best country around and superior to all others. As a single female I\u2019m part of the population that is afraid to travel elsewhere to countries that I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m also scared walking down the street alone here a good chunk of the time; it\u2019s just more familiar bc this is where I grew up, and happen to fit the mold of who has an easier time in the US (aside from being female). I\u2019m a white, thin, straight, cisgender, blonde girl, which is a stereotype that people cater to here (aside from men being creepy towards me and disagreeing with my views on social issues which can get scary at times). \n\nAnyway my point being that it seems as though they might be the type to think that the US is just the best. And that \u201cyou belong here\u201d and that the place that has become your HOME is \u201cjust a third world country\u201d. It sounds as though they believe you should be back in the US, which given only the details of your adoption is already an outlandish expectation of them considering they could not take on a parent role for you as a child. To put on TOP of that that you\u2019ve completely built a happy life for yourself and family along with your family that raised you, it is so out of pocket for them to suggest that you should be elsewhere. Like truly such an insensitive belief for them to voice, and if they\u2019ll voice that, it says to me that they don\u2019t quite understand at ALL what is best for you. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t have numbers or stats on it, but I would have to guess that a LOT of children in foster care in the US that stay within the states, don\u2019t have a fraction of what it sounds like you experienced. A lot of foster children here end up homeless or addicts, or in abusive homes, gangs, committing crime to get by. I\u2019m not saying all or most, but a lot are definitely negatively affected by it, whereas it sounds as though you ended up in a very loving home, and creating a beautiful life for yourself. I literally have written a novel here for you, but I just would hate for any experience to tarnish what you have for yourself in Thailand, based on \u201cwhat you could have\u201d in the US. Because to me it sounds like you\u2019ve got the better option. \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA. You\u2019re sperm and egg donors are trash.

Which I understand because it's expensive and so they wanted me to come to them instead which I don't want to do because it could be a waste of time and money that I could've use for my family instead if it goes wrong.", "True we offered to pay for a hotel for them If they wanted to come and also our  twin daughters are just about to turn 1 in March so I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing them on a 20hr+ flight.", "From what I understand they're from somewhere in Florida I'm not sure where though. The one time I went to the U.S was to NYC actually so it was a pretty good time we did research and stuff to know where we shouldn't go and everything went great. I believe only 3,000 U.S babies are adopted from people from other countries a year. I met my wife when we were kids and we started dating at 14 and got married at the legal age at 17 which isn't normal here either we went pretty fast I think the average age in modern Thailand is 25 now if you go to some remote villages it's different. The house we just recently got last year before are babies were born which also isn't normal here but I have been tutoring English since I was 15, so I was able to work my way up to 50USD an hour but currently I only work 15 hours a week because I want to spend time with my family and 36,000 USD here is enough to be considered well off even for a family four in a big city. Now I would never say that Thailand is a better country overall than the U.S because we definitely have similar problems such as gun violence which we have been trying to crackdown on very heavily  because of a recent tragedy where a police officer shot a 11 people and what has made this the worst tragedy was he walked into a nursery attacked the 5 workers killing 3 and then he stabbed and killed 22 children in total he killed 36 people and injured 10 others. So I have no room to say that Thailand is safer in every area of course these disgusting crimes happen less than they do in the U.S but they still happen here in smaller cities or villages mainly.  Stuff like LGBTQ+ here is interesting to say the least for example same sex relationships have been legal since 1956 and the first sex change was in 1975 and a lot people know about Thailand Trans women or what a lot of people call ladyboys since so many people business men come to have sex with them. Thailand is a LGBTQ+ friendly country where a lot of people aren't scared to be completely out for example a lot of the trans women here are very open and honest about being trans without being scared of saying it. That being said for some reason same sex marriage still isn't legal yet even after all this time and energy from the government to make it even more LGBTQ+ friendly they still just won't legalized it but it's looking like it might happen this year luckily. So we definitely  have things to work on but we're are striving to change all of it and it looks like it's working right now. Also I don't know if you ever planned on visiting Thailand but even with all that, there isn't a reason to worry about being a woman visiting here most of Thailand is considered a safe country for women because a lot of people here are Buddhists most people are very respectful of women, of course they still face sexual harassment sometimes like a lot of places. Now the one thing you do need to worry about as a foreigner is people making you pay more because your foreigner which you can normally negotiation them all the way down to their regular prices they normally do it to see if you're a pushover, and then petty theft. Also research before you go to ancient temples or temples in general because they have certain rules for everyone.

It may be true, but it just isn't the way to handle this, and you can also tell them that any chance of you saving money to travel to the US to meet them has now been destroy by the rude behavior or whoever that biological Aunt is. Tell them that you will not allow anyone to treat you that rude or disrespectfully.\n\nGood luck to you.", "You just described most major city one can travel to.", "Yeah. Visualising OP arriving in the US and being asked for a kidney.\n\nBut how does OP even know if these people are legit? It is SUPER suspect.", "I had a worry about that, but I\u2019m a naturally crabby person so I didn\u2019t want to mention it lol\n\nOr even worse, they try to keep OP over here in the states.", "THIS! I immediately thought, \"Why now? What's their angle? Are they looking for something? Elder care, money, an inheritance from a grandparent, a kidney donor for another child/sibling? Especially when they reacted badly to your comments to your birth-aunt. If they wanted to meet you, why not FaceTime? Did they even show an interest in their twin granddaughters? Be on your guard.", "Any amount of \u2018we\u2019re BETTER because you\u2019re third-world\u2019 is disrespectful, if not just straight up racist/classist/whatever. You sound like you\u2019re doing FAR better than I am, for sure, and you sound happy where you are! That\u2019s great!!", "Yeah I traveled from TX to WV (return trip - visiting TX) when my child was just turning one - the famous Sept 2001 - and that was nightmare before the flights got grounded.  Trying to keep up with a baby/toddler and luggage was a nightmare.  My daughter was pretty good during flights (she got her wings - they reward good children with a little pin just like the pilots/stewards wear) but it was a nightmare and we only had fly for 3 hours with a 1 hour layover.  I could not imagine doubling that (even with wife) and for longer trying to keep a child entertained and getting them to rest, feeding them because that requires formula, etc.", "Oof see Florida could really go either way, definitely a mixed bag there. I just would hate for you to have a negative experience here at the hands of your bio family. You sound like you have an absolutely lovely life. Even if it isn\u2019t the norm for people in either of our countries, I would protect that and your peace at all costs, and I just worry that your bio family seems to (for some reason) believe that their way of life or geographical location of life is superior. Which is silly. Clearly we all have our own issues within the places we live (that shooting and the tragedy at that nursery sound awful yet oh so familiar unfortunately). Everywhere has its dangers, I just wouldn\u2019t want you to bring your family into a scenario where they are judged or treated poorly by anyones limited views in the states. And that bio aunt sounded like the kind of person who views things that way and is intolerant. Which I\u2019m so sorry for. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to go through any of this, because I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it\u2019s been to handle emotionally. I just hope you don\u2019t let any of what your bio fam said, negatively impact you. It still is making my head spin how unfairly they\u2019ve already treated you by getting mad at you for being upset with an unruly bio aunt.\n\nUnrelated but I would absolutely love to travel to Thailand!! I know it\u2019s a beautiful place and specifically I know a lot of people that travel there from the US visit elephant sanctuaries as well (obviously not the only thing to do there and I know enough to never go somewhere where they allow people to ride elephants, but whenever a friend travels there they go see elephants and I\u2019m so jealous). I just am paranoid to travel pretty much anywhere alone \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "You have kids now and they come first! Your bio parents sound like the typical money greedy people when they\u2019re older they expect you to be caregivers and support them. Happens really often. Don\u2019t fall for it. You have an amazing family don\u2019t destroy it for illusions. Keep living your life with good people. Blood doesn\u2019t make someone family", "I live in Pattaya city which isn't as big of a tourist designation as Bangkok, Phuket or Chiang Mai but the funny thing is a decent part of the crimes happen from drunk tourist normally from the U.S.", "This is my suspicion, too. Someone needs an organ. So much harder to pressure OP into it if they come to him, amirite?\n\nDon't go, OP. Even if no organs are asked for, it's still suspicious, not to mention disrespectful of the fact that they're asking you to leave your own family and infant twins for this visit.", "NTA. Block them and live your best life", "if its cheaper for you to come to them why didnt they offer to pay for it? if they really want to meet you they should if your going to come to them. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf keeping their blood together was so important to your bio parents, they've would've done that, instead of letting your real family living against the odds do it all those years.", "NTA I may be wrong but I thought the bio parents are not allowed to get in touch with the child after putting them up for adoption. I always thought the child would have to come looking first. Either way they sound like losers and your bio aunt sounds like a nut job and had absolutely no right to inbox you and start being a Ah!", "NTA", "NTA The good news is they revealed what type of people they are before you spent a penny to go see them, or vice versa. Anyone who will treat you that way is not worth knowing. Sounds like you\u2019ve got a good thing going with your family.\nFriends of mine just moved from the US to Thailand, they are really enjoying it!", "NTA. We found a super cheap flight deal to Thailand when we went to visit friends. If they can be flexible when they come visit, they can price track the flights.", "Thinking the same thing", "Just had to say that reading your comment with the casual spanish thrown in has me laughing so hard at 1AM for a second i thought i woke up everyone lmao. Specially because its just cursing (though on the very mild side)", "Fair enough! I do still stand by it, though.", "Which makes me laugh. Because I am in the U.S., and apparently saying someone has brass balls offends them, but brass cojones is okay. I do not understand the logic, but will take any chance to swear!", "NTA. You live in Thailand with your real family. Sharing DNA doesn't mean they are family. You have a happy life where you are. You have no reason to go to the US unless you and your family want to. \n\nThey reached out to you. They want to see you. It should be up to them to make the trip.", "You are NTA. Rights were severed, your family is in Thailand. Personally I would block them on social media because they are not your \u201creal\u201d family.", "NTA.\n\nBlock your aunt. Block your \"bio\" parents. They are not your family, they mean nothing to you, and your life in Thailand is a good one, a happy one. You don't need people who don't even know you but think they can curse at you in your life; how trashy, and first her behavior, then the parent's actions say a lot about the entire family.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. They should be ashamed.", "Honey your real family is who you say it is. Blood doesn't make you family. If Thailand is where you want to be then that is exactly where you belong. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey sound like a family of racist assholes. I wouldn't want to meet them at this point even if they did come to me.", "You are NTA!!!!  You don\u2019t owe them anything. And I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019d expect you to want to meet them after the way they\u2019re handling this. I have no idea what position you\u2019re in financially. But given you\u2019re only 21, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have unlimited resources. \nI\u2019m glad you ended up with a good family and are happy!", "You're totally reasonable. They want to meet you, not the other way around. You're willing to meet them, but you're definitely not responsible to foot the bill for it. NTA", "NTA. Your life sounds like it\u2019s just fine without these people. They honestly don\u2019t sound like good people. I\u2019d say you\u2019re better off not knowing them at all.", "NTA and their weird insistence on you paying to fly over and \"be where you belong\" is pretty suspicious.  Are you sure that, after avoiding the expense and responsibility of raising you, they aren't trying to get you to move back permanently and take care of them?\n\nMaybe they've been mooching off Auntie and she's trying to pass that off to you. It would explain the anger.\n\nThere are a lot of stories on AITA about absent patents who return to demand support from their adult children.", "You are much better off in Thailand, especially since you weren't subjected to those assholes your entire life. After all they've said so far, they've given you plenty of reason to not want to meet them anywhere.  NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d in some foreign country, OP, regardless of where you were born, and it\u2019s disgusting that they said that to you. \n\n\nYou belong where you want to be, and that\u2019s your home with your really family in Thailand. You are right and they are wrong.", "Sounds like you\u2019re dodging more bullets than a sophomore in a suburban US high school. Consider yourself fortunate and stay home where you\u2019re loved and happy. \n\nNTA", "Yup! And I gotta add:. These poeple sound toxic as heck.   Hug your wife, hug your parents if you can and be so, so glad you were raised by them, your REAL family.  Have NO regrets if you decide to not see those ppl.  I think they've shown their true colors, and it's a lil scary.\n\n  Blood doesn't guarantee squat.", "I think it\u2019s strange they want you to come visit them without your wife and your kids (their grandchildren!).  I am usually the last to believe a conspiracy theory but their lack of interest in your children makes me think they want something from you like bone marrow or a kidney.", "Thailand is wonderful country and only getting better. The USA is a decent country and only getting worse. You do you.", "Thank you, but If you do come here make sure to only come around November to late March early April because that's when we normally aren't in monsoon season. I've never been on the elephants before I'm scared of heights even though my sister loves them so we've been with them often. Also we have a good amount of dangerous animals here like big spiders, venomous snakes, scorpions etc. but the one you need to watch out for is actually the stray dogs here because we have an estimated 1 million strays, most of them are very nice but some will definitely attack you and some will also definitely have rabies.", "So two things.\n\nAs an American, most Americans that I have met dont know Thailand from Vietnam. Like seriously, they would not be able to tell you the difference but they might say they assumed tou live in forest huts. \n\nObviously, not all Americans are this unaware. But you might be surprised by how many are.\n\nYour aunt sounds like she could be one.\n\nWhich *wouldve* brought me to my second point, where I tell you to just not treat her the same as her and your family. But they also responded super bad?\n\nBecause my 2/3 point was going to be \u201cwhat would you do if you understood they truly couldn\u2019t afford to fly out to you. But you could to them?\u201d\n\nNot a leasing question btw. It would have been just a question. Seems pointless though since they sound just as ignorant and awful.\n\nI\u2019d say leave it be. You have a good life and they are missing out for multiple reasons. Ignorance likely the biggest. They can save up to meet you one day in that case if they want.", "NTA. They are not your \u201creal\u201d parents and you absolutely don\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d in the US. If being born some place makes you belong there then my biological sister (only one I have and I was l B raised with her) belongs in Panama and Spanish is her native language because that\u2019s what she understood first. With how your \u201caunt\u201d was treating you then your bio parents, I suggest just being done with all of them. Your life there sounds much better than it would be here. And your family there loves you for you not for what you have or have the potential to have.

You don\u2019t want them to have any idea about your financial resources. \n\nInstead tell them that all you know about them is they abandoned you. Went on to have more children they decided to keep, you don\u2019t know them; you did not search for them; they searched for you. Point out that being called an asshole by an aunt you\u2019ve never met, having strangers insult your wonderful parents, a country you love living in, etc., isn\u2019t persuasive. Your brief exchange with strangers who may be bio relatives left you believing them to be incredibly rude and entitled people to whom you owe nothing.", "NTA. They gave you up and, from the behavior of your \"Aunt\" you're better off not having them in your life. If you \"belonged\" there then why did they give you up in the first place?", "NTA \nAs a parent myself, wth are these people out of their entitled minds?! \nI had children (adults now) and remember flying Houston to NYC to greet the in-laws coming to visit from Europe (they didn't speak english) with an infant and a toddler, that was 5 hr flight one way. We spent the night in NYC and then all 6 of us flew back to Houston. That was a feat!\nI have relatives and friends that were adopted so I understand that issues that can arise when the person who was adopted becomes an adult,  genetic medical history, ect. \nHowever, if I found my adult adopted child and found out I have a daughter-in-law and twin grandbabies you can bet your sweet bippy I'd be making plans to be there asap!!!! I did stupid generic searches on \"priceline\" & \"expedia\" etc. and put Miami to Bangkok at different dates say, mid-april, then I tried mid-june, then mid-October rt 2 week visit 2 adults and 2 kids under 2kUSD total.\nThose people are out of their mind. Maybe 10 years from now they will realize the err of their ways and they can come visit....NTA", "NTA, it sounds  like you have an amazing life in Thailand!    There is no reason just your bio mom can't hope on a plane to meet you.   As a mom and I was in this situation I would hop on the plane.", "NTA you're right in that they gave you up (the reasoning doesn't truly matter tbh) so if they really wanted to meet you they could either come to Thailand or even offer to meet halfway. Your Aunt though yeesh, I wouldn't have a relationship with that one if I were you. People who treat adopted families as less than real are typically assholes. Especially because your bio family are essentially strangers to you.", "NTA you are living where you belong.  I am also adopted and totally understand why you want them to make an effort.  It\u2019s shitty of them to involve your aunt. It\u2019s disgusting to refer to them as your real parents as they aren\u2019t.  Your real parents are the ones who lovingly raised you.\n\nI use to have this romanticized idea of what my birth parents would be like.  My birth mom was nothing like I imagined and to this day I regret meeting her and hurting my mom.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying all meetings are horrible but there was a reason you were given up for adoption.", "NTA and something tells me there is more to this story on the bio families side.", "NTA... I'm laughing. you have free / cheap health care and the US family think you are in a 3rd world country. I was in the hospital for a week last month. I hand them my health card, get settled in, get a room, CT scan, blood tests every day. Cost me nothing. Follow up from specialists, $ nothing.... \n\nIt takes many more hours work for you to travel compared to the USA $. The arrogance of SOME american's trouble me. However, I have not found all this way, and they are my neighbours.", "Why do people think that when someone says no to their idea and then another party curses them out for saying no that is ever going to change someone's mind.

Your bio parents only want to meet you if they don't need to do the financial or travel effort themselves.

It say they should come to you because they gave you up\u201d\n\nWhy? It\u2019s true and honest. Why should he feel obligated to cushion his response to his bio parents?
