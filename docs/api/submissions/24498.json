From the elementary school to present day, people have commented to me that I have a white name and have even implied that my parents must not be proud to be black.

Honestly, by the time your daughter is older, people will probably have moved on to some new insult.   That tends to be how it works.

You both need to find better ways to express your feelings.   \n\nThe only time I believe the mom's opinion should matter more is if the dad isn't really involved.
