Do not feel bad that he does not know how to accept the consequences of his behavior. You are not responsible. If anything this is a valuable learning opportunity for him. \n\nRacism isn\u2019t so black and white. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for white people who don\u2019t think they are racist that they may harbor prejudice thoughts and feelings unknowingly until someone points it out to them and then it\u2019s a shock to their system. Especially if they are a fully grown adult with a fixed sense of their identity and self.", "NTA. If that was what he said on a *first date*, I can't even imagine what would be in store for when he actually feels comfortable.", "NTA- there is nothing wrong with saying \"you smell nice\" and nothing more.  The fact he had to inject dating someone else and they smelled bad is just so wrong and yes racist.", ">\"he started shaking, tearing up, and almost had a panic attack.

If that's something that you don't want to deal with; it's a first date, you are totally NTA for saying \"nope, don't want this\" and moving right on with your life.", "NTA.

I happen to think that you're right.\n\nTell them to prove you wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not about whether or not he\u2019s capable of change, you are not obligated to continue dating someone who made you feel that way date one.

You\u2019re looking for partner, not a project.", "Can people change? Yes. Do we need to be with those people despite them hurting us just because there is hope they will change? No. NTA. Also did your mutual friends not listen to what he said?", "ESH So first of all, that was absolutely racist and it's certainly not your job to educate racist people.

Now yes he is an A cause he was dumb to bring up another date experience to this. Is bad at constructing his sentence. Blurting his thoughts without a thought. Then making a scene by panicing.\n\nHonestly felt like he was complementing you then got dumb and tried to be say an ancedote about a previous experience but added enough detail to be racist sounding. Though who knows maybe he really did think everyone smelt like that till you and is racist.\n\nNow you OP are an A for just jumping and using that race card. Cause everything nowadays gotta be racist. Then on top of that telling him he is basically incapable of change because of your hurt feelings. Which is the definition of an eye for an eye which most agree is a both sides are A for that.\n\nWho knows maybe you'll learn from this.

That comment was off the charts, and your honest response to the insult doesn't need to be softer than it was. Maybe he can change, but it is not your job to stick around and find out. He was good when he had time to think everything through and didn't have to face you\u2014but one on one in real time, he's a mess.", "NTA\n\nThis is what dating is for, to see if you mutually enjoy each other\u2019s company. You did not have a mutually enjoyable experience. You did not enjoy the way he expressed himself or his view. You did not enjoy how he managed that difficult experience. For you I imagine it was unpleasant, disappointing, potentially insulting and exhausting. \n\nIt\u2019s not so much that \u201cpeople can\u2019t change\u201d it\u2019s more like it is entirely impractical to date someone once and then launch into some kind of exercise to make them a good fit.  Dating is not a \u201cyou agree to a date, you now are committed to fixing their issues\u201d deal. \n\nYou used dating for it\u2019s intended purpose and concluded you weren\u2019t a good fit. That could have gone either way. Unfortunately when dating part of the process involves accepting that it might not work out how you wanted. This guy is going to have to accept that and your mutual friends need to get on board.", "Yes!!!! I also felt like him crying and all that made me feel like I was the one who hurt him, when it fact it was me who was hurt by his comment as I was sooo happy after we kissed and his comment blindsided me.", "This 100%. It\u2019s one thing to tell her that she smells nice, but the fact his brain went \u201cooh this other woman I dated who\u2019s the same ethnic background as her smelled horrible! Tell her that!\u201d and he *listened and did it* is a 4th of July parade of red flags. NTA and massive bullet dodged.", "Yes!!!! I also feel like his emotional reaction led me to comforting him, and feeling like I led him to have a panic attack. His reaction filled me with self-doubt on whether or not the comment was racist and if I overreacted. But when I slept on it, I did feel like it was in fact a hurtful and racist comment.", "HAHA truly! The awkwardness has began lol", "They seem more focused on how sorry and upset he is, and how \"he is a great guy who means well and says silly things sometimes\".\n\nBut to me, it felt more than a clumsy comment. It made me feel he has biases towards people from my culture.", "It's noteworthy that she didn't say he won't, just that she is unsure that he will. Personally, I wouldn't want to stick around until he figures it out.", "I hear you! I do believe people are capable of change. He is just a very highly educated man in his early 30s in a very multi-cultural city and friend group...so I feel like he had all factors on his side to learn some sensitivity. I am truly not defending myself but trying to give you more context on what i meant.", "First, he is not autistic or on the spectrum. I am very sensitive to these things being neurodivergent myself and I do not appreciate your implication I am being ableist or playing the race card.\n\nHe assumed I would smell bad because of my race... that is racist..", "You are wrong.\nThere is no \"race card\". \n\nThere are reactions to racist words and behaviour, and there are repercussions for the people who say, do, and support racist behaviour.", "Right! \n\nAlso, like what was he thinking that after the kiss he thought, race aside, \u2018oh wow she smells better than the last woman I kissed\u2019 I better tell her so\u2026.?????", "Thanks for the validation for real! Some commentors are doing the whole \"you are assuming its racist\" etc. thing and I am glad others see what I saw as it hurt my feelings and already my friends are diminishing it and feeling bad for him.", "Oh how silly of him poor guy -_- I think it would be valuable to explain to your friends that a comment like that is unnecessary.", "No, she absolutely does not have to stick around/agree to another date", "Did you ask him or did you go he's not like me so he gotta be neurotypical? Cause you do be assuming that.\n\nNo one likes having things implied about what they say or do when they don't mean it that way. But if they feel it I guess its right.\n\n>After we kissed, he said he was so happy with how good I smelled since he once went on a date with a woman from my same ethnic background and she smelled bad\n\nNow if he left out that ethnic part. Just saying a girl he dated smelled bad. Do you think he was sexist for going out with one bad smelling girl and being happy another girl he dated didnt smell bad?\n\nAlso did you ask him if he assumed that or did you assume that he assumed?", "So is describing a person racist?\n\nSentence 1. \"A man drinks whiskey\" pretty neutral right?\n\nSentence 2. \"An African man drinks whiskey\" Id imagine not racist or am I wrong?\n\nSentence 3. \"An Irish man drinks whiskey\" Sounding kinda stereotypical there huh?\n\nSentence 4. \"A man eats fried chicken\" Simple sentence.\n\nSentence 5. \"An Irish man eats fried chicken\" still rather simple\n\nSentence 6. \"An African Man eats fried chicken\" Now this sounding stereotypical and racist am i right?", "Nope. Did you feel like I said she did?", "We have literally spoken about our different diagnoses and our challenges. That said, I am not interested in continuing this conversation with you, where you keep dismissing the reality of a racist interaction I had. Not sure what you are trying to accomplish. Especially that I never said he is racist but that his comment is racist, Good day!", "He assumed I smelled because of my ethnic background. But sure, enjoy this pseudointellectualism of yours."]}
