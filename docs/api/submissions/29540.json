That comment was off the charts, and your honest response to the insult doesn't need to be softer than it was. Maybe he can change, but it is not your job to stick around and find out.

You did not have a mutually enjoyable experience. You did not enjoy the way he expressed himself or his view. You did not enjoy how he managed that difficult experience. For you I imagine it was unpleasant, disappointing, potentially insulting and exhausting. \n\nIt\u2019s not so much that \u201cpeople can\u2019t change\u201d it\u2019s more like it is entirely impractical to date someone once and then launch into some kind of exercise to make them a good fit.  Dating is not a \u201cyou agree to a date, you now are committed to fixing their issues\u201d deal. \n\nYou used dating for it\u2019s intended purpose and concluded you weren\u2019t a good fit. That could have gone either way. Unfortunately when dating part of the process involves accepting that it might not work out how you wanted. This guy is going to have to accept that and your mutual friends need to get on board.", "Yes!!!!

I also feel like his emotional reaction led me to comforting him, and feeling like I led him to have a panic attack. His reaction filled me with self-doubt on whether or not the comment was racist and if I overreacted. But when I slept on it, I did feel like it was in fact a hurtful and racist comment.", "HAHA truly! The awkwardness has began lol", "They seem more focused on how sorry and upset he is, and how \"he is a great guy who means well and says silly things sometimes\".\n\nBut to me, it felt more than a clumsy comment. It made me feel he has biases towards people from my culture.", "It's noteworthy that she didn't say he won't, just that she is unsure that he will. Personally, I wouldn't want to stick around until he figures it out.", "I hear you! I do believe people are capable of change. He is just a very highly educated man in his early 30s in a very multi-cultural city and friend group...so I feel like he had all factors on his side to learn some sensitivity. I am truly not defending myself but trying to give you more context on what i meant.", "First, he is not autistic or on the spectrum. I am very sensitive to these things being neurodivergent myself and I do not appreciate your implication I am being ableist or playing the race card.\n\nHe assumed I would smell bad because of my race... that is racist..", "You are wrong.\nThere is no \"race card\". \n\nThere are reactions to racist words and behaviour, and there are repercussions for the people who say, do, and support racist behaviour.", "Right! \n\nAlso, like what was he thinking that after the kiss he thought, race aside, \u2018oh wow she smells better than the last woman I kissed\u2019 I better tell her so\u2026.?????", "Thanks for the validation for real! Some commentors are doing the whole \"you are assuming its racist\" etc. thing and I am glad others see what I saw as it hurt my feelings and already my friends are diminishing it and feeling bad for him.", "Oh how silly of him poor guy -_- I think it would be valuable to explain to your friends that a comment like that is unnecessary.", "No, she absolutely does not have to stick around/agree to another date", "Did you ask him or did you go he's not like me so he gotta be neurotypical?

Just saying a girl he dated smelled bad. Do you think he was sexist for going out with one bad smelling girl and being happy another girl he dated didnt smell bad?\n\nAlso did you ask him if he assumed that or did you assume that he assumed?", "So is describing a person racist?\n\nSentence 1. \"A man drinks whiskey\" pretty neutral right?\n\nSentence 2. \"An African man drinks whiskey\" Id imagine not racist or am I wrong?\n\nSentence 3. \"An Irish man drinks whiskey\" Sounding kinda stereotypical there huh?\n\nSentence 4. \"A man eats fried chicken\" Simple sentence.\n\nSentence 5. \"An Irish man eats fried chicken\" still rather simple\n\nSentence 6. \"An African Man eats fried chicken\" Now this sounding stereotypical and racist am i right?", "Nope. Did you feel like I said she did?", "We have literally spoken about our different diagnoses and our challenges. That said, I am not interested in continuing this conversation with you, where you keep dismissing the reality of a racist interaction I had. Not sure what you are trying to accomplish.

But sure, enjoy this pseudointellectualism of yours.", "NTA. I'm so white you can see my blood vessels in multiple spots around my body. Sounds pretty gd racist to me. I'm sorry you liked him and this happened, but if he thought \"yeah this is a great thing to say!!\"... nope. Nope nope nope.", "NTA. His first comment (even if he took responsibility and apologized) would\u2019ve turned me off to a second date. Sometimes first impressions are hard to change and this was one of them. But it was his intense reaction after - the shaking, tears, panic attack - that nailed it for me. Like what the heck? I thought my friends liked me, why would they set me up with someone who\u2019s so emotionally immature? Run. Run away and don\u2019t look back. You don\u2019t need that kind of baggage.", "NTA. Yikes. We all say stupid things sometimes or have something come out inappropriately when we really didn\u2019t mean it that way. We also all have biases that get challenged by those around us. It is not your fault this guy had a panic attack for getting called out on saying something racist. What he should have said is \u201cyou\u2019re right, I am so sorry I said that, it was wrong\u201d and then STOPPED TALKING and accepted your response, whatever it was, because part of being an adult is taking responsibility for our actions and accepting the consequences.", "NTA. If the FIRST time you hang out with him, when he\u2019s supposed to be on his BEST behavior, he says something racist, just run away. He hasn\u2019t earned the right for the benefit of the doubt. This is his best behavior? What\u2019s his worst??\n\nIf you had been together for six months showing himself not to be racist, and then he said something accidentally racist, that\u2019s when you give the benefit of the doubt (but a thin rope). \n\nIf he\u2019s so out of it he can\u2019t see how it came off without having a panic attack, he needs therapy not a girlfriend.", "NTA - I also put my foot in my mouth fairly often, and I do feel for bad for him since I've had that immediate 'oh my God what is wrong with me' panic reaction. But nowhere in my collection of embarrassing moments have I said something super racist!! I've also worked really hard to just not blurt things out, especially when I'm nervous. If he can't do that for a first date, then yeah, he needs to try harder.\n\nIt would be nice to say you don't hold it against him (if that's true!), but you don't owe him or your friends who set this up anything.", "NTA. As a white person, if I were say anything to someone of a different race and they responded by telling me what I just said is racist my response would be \u201cI am so sorry, that was not my intention\u201d or something similar but having a panic attack and turning himself into the victim? He\u2019s the AH and he\u2019s racist for sure", "NTA. What he said was incredibly rude, prejudiced, immature and offensive. His reaction to being called out was over the top dramatic and more than a little manipulative. And him and your mutual friends thinking it's your job to teach him how to be an adult and stick around after he said something so gross is bullshit. It didn't work out between you and that's that. If he is capable of controlling his words, he can prove it with someone else. Good for you on noping the fuck out. That's horrendous.", "NTA. I am blown away by the audacity. An authentic apology doesn\u2019t make it the responsibility of the offended party to immediately soothe their offender. \n\nAlso telling on himself that he immediately went and created drama in the friend group to punish you. Maybe point out to your friends that if he was really sorry, he\u2019d be ashamed and taking a moment of quiet reflection instead of spreading the news far and wide expecting sympathy. \n\nHe\u2019s a racist baby who wants women to coddle him so he never has to mature. Sorry you got hurt like that.", "Nope. Perhaps he does have foot in mouth disease , but the fact that he is even making any assumptions that all x=y based on one interaction with x is problematic, period. Trust your gut. \n\nMaybe he\u2019s not a bad guy deep down. You break it off with him and he learns a powerful lesson about stereotyping and becomes a better version of himself in the future. \n\nBut you are not here to teach him that lesson and he can\u2019t learn it from you. As long as he is with you, it gives him an excuse not to rethink his mindset bc if you\u2019re ok with his behavior, then his worldview must not be that bad. \n\nDon\u2019t enable this. Wish him well and hope he learns his lesson and evolves and you can move on to someone whose respect you don\u2019t have to question.", "NTA. HE was being racist, he is not the victim here even if he felt like he was. I'm sorry you've had to deal with this whole thing.\nEdit: I also just want to say that being socially awkward doesn't make you accidentally say racist things unless you actually do have those biases/prejudices.", "Nta. You are not a property brother, and you don't have to date a racist fixer upper, just because he feels bad about saying racist s***. Is he really apologetic about it? maybe. Does that entitle him to your attention, affection, and support? Hell no. He's not entitled to your emotional labor.", "NTA - People do say stupid things all the time, especially when nervous. His comment was a stupid thing based on his own bias. He is not the person for you (or many other people, I fear).", "Oh jeez NTA! That was such a rude comment for him to make and then for you to have to console him, give me a break. If he can change that will be up to him and if he can\u2019t that will also be up to him.", "NTA -- it was an awful thing to say to someone you've just kissed -- and clearly it was in his head, whether or not he said it.\n\nYou don't have to nurse his feelings when he's the one who said something appalling to you. You're right that a man of his age should absolutely be able to manage what comes out of his mouth unless he has a medical condition.", "NTA", "NTA. As a fellow woman of color I can 100% say that is racist as fuck.\n\nWould he tell a white woman \"damn, this last white girl had a smelly breath, but you do not!\"? No of course he wouldn't.\n\nReminds me of a dude who told me once \"normally I do not like black girls but you are pretty.\" Like back then I was not taking issue with it, I was young. But in hindsight and the older I got, I realized how shitty it is. People think this shit normal to say but thankfully some are getting more aware that you should not compare race to begin with.\n\nRidiculous.", "NTA and your friends are inappropriate for suggesting it. You don't have to date someone in order to prove they're not a racist. It's only three months - just cut him off. These things are not going to get better.\n\nDo you really want to be dealing with these comments for years?", "Yes, he can change. But there's absolutely no reason why you have to hang around on the off chance that he does. Part of the dating process is to work out whether someone is compatible with you.\n\nSomeone falling to pieces and making it all about them because you've pointed out they've made a comment that you (quite reasonably, I might add!) found offensive is unlikely to be compatible!\n\nIf you really think there's potential there despite that, give him another date or talk to him about the problematic nature of his reaction. But I think you're right to feel that the tendency to overreact and self-focus when he's called out over an issue is likely to be a recurring problem, given his age.\n\nEdited to add - NTA", "NTA.  Particularly since he was othering you and trying to compliment you by denigrating another woman of your race.", "He might be able to change.  But that\u2019s up to him.  Nothing to do with you.  With you he was incredibly offensive and you are under no obligation to give him a chance to change.  \nHe can do the work himself and then, if you are available, you might be interested.  \n\nBut on the evidence so far, I highly doubt it.", "OP didn't mention the race of the dude. \n\nEveryone has prejudicial thoughts and feelings. Not just Whites.", "What\u2026 an odd reaction\u2026. Even if you disregard the obvious racist comment, sounds like this guy has issues that might be a bit too much to put up with so early on into dating. And his friends are not it. Run from all of them.", "What\u2026 an odd reaction\u2026.

I do find his reaction made things worst...I  know not everyone can easily manage their emotions but his intense emotions and over the top self-blame completely disarmed me and made the situation feel like I am the one who hurt him...there might have been hope if he accepted my reaction and simply apologized.", "I truly do not hold it against him! I am sad because I really liked him, also!  \nI just do not like how they (he and my friends) turned the situation into him being the victim..", "Even if you what you said wasn't racist?

Imagine if he was one of those dudes who kept that stuff inside his head only, and you didn't find out for YEARS that he was actually a racist asshole.", "If racism were merely \u201csilly\u201d, history class would be a lot less depressing.", "Gotta agree with your take on this.", "He does. And that's his problem to fix, not yours. Did he tell you you're *so articulate,* too? How could you ever introduce him to anyone you care about when he acts like that? You can't.", "He is \"othering\" you because he is a racist.  You're not like all the other women of youre race so it's okay.  They are all bad and stinky.  And you could expect this forever.", "Practice. Lots and lots of practice.", "He may very well change in the future - but it is not your job to babysit him until he does.", "How can anyone read that and not see how racist it is? Fuck's sake... NTA", "None of those are negative traits, nor does the speaker equate an ethnicity with a negative trait. \n\nTherefore these are not equivalent to OP's situation at all, especially when it comes to equating Black - a skin colour - with African - a continent of people from over 50 countries.\n \nNumber 6 is specifically a racist stereotype in the USA, but I have never heard or seen it used with the word \"African\".\n\nLet's try a statement that equates an ethnicity with a negative attribute:\n\n\"I'm so glad you, being a white man as you are, didn't rape me. Three white men have raped me, so I am very careful around white men.\"\n\n\"You're pretty smart for a rich blonde woman. I had a blonde colleague, and she was really stupid. You must have rich parents who paid through the nose for your education. Well done.\"\n\nEdited: TIL that a sharp aka hashtag enlarges the font.\nEdited: paragraphs; word.", "Least you can come up with a good response. I'm happy about that. But no not all racism comes with negativity.\n\nSaying \"All Asians are good at math\" is a racist stereotype even if it feels like it is a positive thing.\n\nI used African for an important reason. To see if people would take it as a person that is an African citizen eating fried chicken or if someone would take it as the stereo type.\n\nBut you are correct indeed there is an american stereotype for african americans liking fried chicken. But if you were told to physical describe everyone in a restaurant that sold fried chicken and a person eating fried chicken there was african american would that make you racist under that circumstances?\n\nAlso understandable with those two examples.\n\nAlso also didn't know that about the hashtag. Interesting."]}
