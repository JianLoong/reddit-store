They are civil with each other but have their own lives. It is just how our family is, especially since my husband and I got married when my son was 14 and his daughter was 12. \n\nI\u2019m not too strict with my son. I don\u2019t know what he does with his friends and I\u2019m not too involved in his personal relationships. We are still just as close as any other mother and child. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago my step daughter sent me a series of photos of my son. I believe he may have posted them on his private social media accounts and it was images of him at parties, smoking, drinking, and doing things with both genders. I immediately told my step daughter that what she did was unnecessary and inappropriate. She replied with \u201csorry\u201d \u201cjust thought u should know\u201d. I told her that unless he\u2019s in danger or hurting himself/other people, I\u2019d rather not know what my 18 year old son does in his free time. \n\nNow I did not want them to fight, so I didn\u2019t say anything. Especially since my step daughter apologized once again. \n\nBut yesterday I was with my husband and he was showing me a video on his phone when his daughter started sending him a bunch of messages. He opened them in front of me and it was the same exact pictures of my son that she sent me days before. But this time she said, \u201cSo I sent these to -stepmom- but she thinks this is okay behaviour\u2026 do you agree?\u201d My husband didn\u2019t really know how to react and told her that it really wasn\u2019t any of their business what he does and she just sent a bunch of eyeroll emojis. \n\nMy son came home a while later and I decided to tell him that his step sister was sending us pictures of him. He seemed confused and asked to see so I showed him the messages. He was extremely embarrassed and upset and went to his room. I then heard him on the phone yelling at someone. My step daughter came home an hour later and started yelling at me for \u201csnitching\u201d on her. I told her that she was invading his privacy and he has the right to know. I gave her the benefit of the doubt the first time but then she sent the pictures to her father. She said that I just ruined half of her friendships and my son and a lot of his friends blocked her on social media. She says that she had good intentions and wanted me to know what he was up to just in case but I just had to assume the worst. \n\nMy husband agrees that my son should know but he thinks we could\u2019ve just given him a vague idea instead of showing the pictures and actually telling him. AITA?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nHim posting those pictures on social media was just my assumption. Some look very clearly posted by him on his PRIVATE social media accounts but some were blurry enough for me to question it. My son is too embarrassed to even look at me right now, so I cannot confirm. I\u2019m trying and have reassured him, but he\u2019s locked himself in his room so I\u2019m giving him some time before trying again. \n\nAlso, I clearly state that I have no interest in his personal relationships. I know he doesn\u2019t hang out with weird or dangerous people and that is all I need to know. I did not say that I have no interest in his life at all. That is an extremely unfair assumption.

It sounds like you're pretty hands off but idk you only really said that about his friend group. A lot of things can go wrong with an uninformed 18 year old experimenting with drugs, alcohol and sex.

Stalkers don't get to have their \"privacy\" of being a stalker respected. You didn't invade her private life and you didn't talk out of turn about a minor foible just to get her into trouble.

Not sure you went about it the best way, but I think what you did was generally reasonable.  For some reason, she's looking to make trouble.  As the parent-figure, think you and her dad should try to figure that out.  Is she starting things or seeking revenge for something?", "nta op - it's clear that your step daughter overstepped her boundaries and invaded your son's privacy. You handled the situation well by respecting your son's autonomy as an 18-year-old. She needs to learn that her actions have consequences and that she should focus on her own life instead of trying to control her stepbrother's.", "NTA. Your son is an adult and should know about this.", "I think the best thing is chat to your daughter and find out why she's so worried, since she could be worried about his unhealthy behaviours and her concern might come from a place of love.", "NAH. 16 is a weird age. Most 12 year olds get taught that drinking and drugs and casual sex are dangerous and bad and that it sets you down this terrible path to becoming a junky. Eventually most people grow out of it, but it truly sticks to some people.\n\n\n\nIf your son was 14 she would have made the right decision in what she did, you would need to see what your son is up to and it would have been concerning to see this behaviour. She needs a conversation to understand 1)that your son is 18 and the standards for his behaviour have changed. He can drink if he wants to, he can sleep around and he can smoke. It\u2019s up to him to deal with repercussions of doing those things dangerously, and it is possible to do those things safely. 2) How to discuss concerns without invading privacy. If she is actually concerned that your son is drinking too much or smoking too much she *should* bring those concerns to you and talk to you about it, but without sending unprompted pictures. He is an adult that deserves privacy but she is also a sister who has a right to be concerned and voice them. You can talk to her and either reassure her that his behaviour is normal or learn something concerning. (For instance I was no snitch but if I had sent pictures of my sister smoking weed at a party my parents wouldn\u2019t have cared. But might have cared if I had mentioned that the party was at the towns violent cocaine sellers house)", "\r  \nNTA - Your stepdaughter crossed a line invading his privacy, and your son deserves to know what's going on without unnecessary drama.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Daughter is as she was snitching on the son! He's an adult, and as long as he isn't hurting himself or anyone else or breaking the law then his business is his business. Lesson for her to learn.

He has every right to be annoyed at SS and him and his friends should absolutely block someone that abuses their access to that side of things in this way. Definitely not your fault that she may have lost friends, it's absolutely hers for behaving as she did and she shouldn't be surprised that her actions had consequences.\n\nPlus, I personally don't see an issue in you allowing your 18yo son an element of freedom to make their own choices (because let's face it, in alot of cases they probably wouldn't listen to no smoking/drinking anyway) and since son is 18 (and depending on where you are) is legally considered an adult and able to smoke and drink in some places.", "NTA he's 18, most places on the planet that makes him an adult.

If they\u2019re things you wouldn\u2019t want to see him doing they might be things she wouldn\u2019t want to see either and it would be a bit intimidating if she\u2019d been sent them by him unsolicited.\n\nGiven that she seemed apologetic after sharing with you, this isn\u2019t necessarily a case of her tattling, she could have been trying to ask for help in a subtle way. Just assuming that she\u2019s helped herself to them isn\u2019t necessarily fair - he has a responsibility to protect her from seeing too much explicit material about himself in the same way he chooses not to share those things with you.\n\nSo it\u2019s a slight possibility that he\u2019s the asshole here rather than her.

She tried to tell her father what was going on and then you both dismissed her. Your son is behaving irresponsibly and posting it online for all to see - even if he thinks he has a selected audience.

I would atleast talk to him about drinking in moderation and the dangers of alcohol.", "If you\u2019re in the US it is not legal for him to drink. A ticket for MIP, etc. Underage drinking is considered a serious violation in most areas. Even if you consider it a no-big-deal typical behavior of adolescents, that\u2019s not the way many potential employers, including the US military (if he\u2019s so inclined) would look at it. Besides that there are some potential health consequences of using alcohol at a young age; it can impact how a teen\u2019s brain develops (this is the time fine-tuning of the brain occurs), disrupt their sleeping patterns, make it harder to concentrate, increase their risk for liver and heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer. And this is just talking about alcohol, not even including all the potential drugs\n\nYou\u2019ve seen just a snap shot of what he\u2019s doing. You don\u2019t know what it means at this point. Is he recreating once a month, on the weekends, or is this an every day occurrence? How much does he indulge? Does he always know what he is consuming, drinks or drugs? Has he ever gotten to the point where he needs assistance? Over consumed? Etc\u2026 without judgement you might want to have a serious and open discussion with your son. Yes,he is technically an adult which means that these things you dismissed so easily will NOT be such an easy dismissal if for any reason law enforcement becomes involved, and actually have the potential to limit his future choices. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being hovering to have an open and frank discussion with him. And make sure he knows he can always call you anytime, no matter how late, if he ever needs you to come pick him up no questions asked. Always better to be safe.\n\nLastly, I would have a discussion with your stepdaughter about why she felt you needed to see those pictures. You dismissed her rather quickly instead of discussing anything. You have no idea if she was trying to get him in trouble or if she was truly worried about him. Which really makes me wonder \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you even consider that she could be genuinely worried for her stepbrother? My guess is she\u2019s seen your parenting style with him for a number of years now and I would assume she would know that showing you the pictures would bring forth some angry, seething monster of punishment from you, as I get that is thankfully not your parenting style at all. I figure she probably thought you would talk to him without letting him know she went to you. Maybe she was hoping he\u2019d think you stumbled onto them yourself,  I mean if he posted these images to his social media then they are out there for the world to see,right? At any rate,you\u2019ll never know her motives without having a genuine conversation. \n\nI really hope this doesn\u2019t put a permanent rift between your two kids. Family therapy might be a good idea. At the very least maybe some open family discussions with no blaming or faulting. \n\nBTW, FWIT I think the US laws on drinking are ridiculous and coupled with American views on alcohol, do little more than create an environment which fosters underage drinking and more. I agree what your son did is very typical for the age, but I would talk with him to make it is the whole story (before it does get too deep) and let him know he can talk to you without judgement.

A nurse friends daughter 18 got drunk and hit another car. she was arrested and he was also charged because car was registered to him and pictures surfaced of her drinking with parents and online posts of her saying her parents let her drink. Friends also snitched, Dude has to pay more than 100k in restitution. some states still consider 18 to be a minor", "Fair enough.", "He's 18 and drinking and having sex, that's harmless dude.", "He doesn't need to be. In my country, you need to he 18 to be legally allowed to drink and smoke, etc", "It's 18 for alcohol in Australia and NZ and many European countries. I think the legal age to buy alcohol is even 16 in other European countries.", "Based on spelling (behaviour) of certain words definitely outside the US. \n\nCan\u2019t really know legal status, but regardless it\u2019s clear his mom and him have boundaries they\u2019re both comfortable with and those were violated. \n\nI think perhaps she\u2019s a bit generous saying she knows he doesn\u2019t hang out with weirdos on the one hand and then on the other says I have no idea what he\u2019s doing or who he\u2019s with\u2026but that\u2019s a parenting decision and he\u2019s 18 anyway. Not my place to judge. \n\nAnd definitely not his stepsister\u2019s.", "And also it doesn't come across as a caring conversation from step-sis. It comes across as stiring the pot.\n\nCaring would first be going to the person involved and saying \"I'm worried about your behaviour because I think it puts you in X, Y, Z danger\". Then - if that doesn't work - speaking to the mother about specific concerns (eg drink driving) not just \"I thought you would want to see this\".", "Or is she jealous? Either of the freedom older brother has or does she fancy him?", "Or would be.", "Where did she do that? I reread the post and the only mention of her friends that I saw was saying he blocked her and her friends.", "Well I don\u2019t believe this is the case. Everything my son was allowed to do at 16, she is also allowed to do as well. It will be the same when she\u2019s 18. We pretty much give them the freedom to do what they want. My step daughter just has to be home before 10pm on school nights, we need to know where she plans on going if she wants to go out, and she has to introduce us to whoever she is dating. My son had the same rules when he was 16.", "Pretty sure op is in Canada based on a previous comment and they are not going to hold the parents responsible for the actions of an 18 year old. They would go after her insurance in case of an accident but nothing like what you are describing.", "yup beer and wine is 16 here. Liquor is 18.", "I mispoke. I ASSUME the girl is spreading it around because she already has. She's a teenager. Is there even a slim chance she isn't spreading it around? I don't think so.", ">She said that I just ruined half of her friendships and my son and a lot of his friends blocked her on social media.\n\nStepsister said that to OP so somehow half of her own friends are not supportive of what she did.", "I have seen families treat their girls differently to their boys, it happens. You may not think its true but that could be her perception. Worth exploring her reasoning though.", "Yeah, but that\u2019s not her posting these images on sites with her friends. As far as the OP said, she only texted these images to her and her husband.", "Of course, this will definitely be discussed. Thank you!", "Also ask her why she is mad that she got blocked by people whom she considered not good enough for her step-brother. What is her end goal and why she even cares. She can't have it both ways: being friends with them herself and wanting you to punish your son for spending time with them.", "I didn\u2019t realize my mom preferred men over women (and most likely boys over girls) until I was encouraging her to climb this rock that had like a sling to help people climb because I wanted to show her something that was really important to me. She was literally about to turn around and go home when a guy my age popped up and encouraged her to do and she immediately went up. \n\nIt made me realize how many times I like that I had missed. \n\nJust to give you an idea of how not-obvious a parent treating genders differently could look."]}
