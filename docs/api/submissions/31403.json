They are civil with each other but have their own lives. It is just how our family is, especially since my husband and I got married when my son was 14 and his daughter was 12. \n\nI\u2019m not too strict with my son. I don\u2019t know what he does with his friends and I\u2019m not too involved in his personal relationships. We are still just as close as any other mother and child. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago my step daughter sent me a series of photos of my son. I believe he may have posted them on his private social media accounts and it was images of him at parties, smoking, drinking, and doing things with both genders. I immediately told my step daughter that what she did was unnecessary and inappropriate. She replied with \u201csorry\u201d \u201cjust thought u should know\u201d. I told her that unless he\u2019s in danger or hurting himself/other people, I\u2019d rather not know what my 18 year old son does in his free time. \n\nNow I did not want them to fight, so I didn\u2019t say anything. Especially since my step daughter apologized once again. \n\nBut yesterday I was with my husband and he was showing me a video on his phone when his daughter started sending him a bunch of messages. He opened them in front of me and it was the same exact pictures of my son that she sent me days before. But this time she said, \u201cSo I sent these to -stepmom- but she thinks this is okay behaviour\u2026 do you agree?\u201d My husband didn\u2019t really know how to react and told her that it really wasn\u2019t any of their business what he does and she just sent a bunch of eyeroll emojis. \n\nMy son came home a while later and I decided to tell him that his step sister was sending us pictures of him. He seemed confused and asked to see so I showed him the messages. He was extremely embarrassed and upset and went to his room. I then heard him on the phone yelling at someone. My step daughter came home an hour later and started yelling at me for \u201csnitching\u201d on her. I told her that she was invading his privacy and he has the right to know. I gave her the benefit of the doubt the first time but then she sent the pictures to her father. She said that I just ruined half of her friendships and my son and a lot of his friends blocked her on social media. She says that she had good intentions and wanted me to know what he was up to just in case but I just had to assume the worst. \n\nMy husband agrees that my son should know but he thinks we could\u2019ve just given him a vague idea instead of showing the pictures and actually telling him. AITA?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nHim posting those pictures on social media was just my assumption. Some look very clearly posted by him on his PRIVATE social media accounts but some were blurry enough for me to question it. My son is too embarrassed to even look at me right now, so I cannot confirm. I\u2019m trying and have reassured him, but he\u2019s locked himself in his room so I\u2019m giving him some time before trying again. \n\nAlso, I clearly state that I have no interest in his personal relationships. I know he doesn\u2019t hang out with weird or dangerous people and that is all I need to know. I did not say that I have no interest in his life at all. That is an extremely unfair assumption.

You handled the situation well by respecting your son's autonomy as an 18-year-old. She needs to learn that her actions have consequences and that she should focus on her own life instead of trying to control her stepbrother's.", "NTA. Your son is an adult and should know about this.", "I think the best thing is chat to your daughter and find out why she's so worried, since she could be worried about his unhealthy behaviours and her concern might come from a place of love.", "NAH. 16 is a weird age. Most 12 year olds get taught that drinking and drugs and casual sex are dangerous and bad and that it sets you down this terrible path to becoming a junky. Eventually most people grow out of it, but it truly sticks to some people.\n\n\n\nIf your son was 14 she would have made the right decision in what she did, you would need to see what your son is up to and it would have been concerning to see this behaviour. She needs a conversation to understand 1)that your son is 18 and the standards for his behaviour have changed. He can drink if he wants to, he can sleep around and he can smoke. It\u2019s up to him to deal with repercussions of doing those things dangerously, and it is possible to do those things safely. 2) How to discuss concerns without invading privacy. If she is actually concerned that your son is drinking too much or smoking too much she *should* bring those concerns to you and talk to you about it, but without sending unprompted pictures. He is an adult that deserves privacy but she is also a sister who has a right to be concerned and voice them. You can talk to her and either reassure her that his behaviour is normal or learn something concerning. (For instance I was no snitch but if I had sent pictures of my sister smoking weed at a party my parents wouldn\u2019t have cared.

He has every right to be annoyed at SS and him and his friends should absolutely block someone that abuses their access to that side of things in this way. Definitely not your fault that she may have lost friends, it's absolutely hers for behaving as she did and she shouldn't be surprised that her actions had consequences.\n\nI also personally don't see an issue in you allowing your 18yo son an element of freedom to make their own choices (because let's face it, in alot of cases they probably wouldn't listen to no smoking/drinking anyway) and since son is 18, all you can do at that age really is not completely enable them whilst providing them the tools to make relatively well-informed decisions where they can come to you if required by choice, which is what it sounds like you're doing.

If they\u2019re things you wouldn\u2019t want to see him doing they might be things she wouldn\u2019t want to see either and it would be a bit intimidating if she\u2019d been sent them by him unsolicited.\n\nGiven that she seemed apologetic after sharing with you, this isn\u2019t necessarily a case of her tattling, she could have been trying to ask for help in a subtle way.

I would atleast talk to him about drinking in moderation and the dangers of alcohol.", "If you\u2019re in the US it is not legal for him to drink. A ticket for MIP, etc. Underage drinking is considered a serious violation in most areas. Even if you consider it a no-big-deal typical behavior of adolescents, that\u2019s not the way many potential employers, including the US military (if he\u2019s so inclined) would look at it. Besides that there are some potential health consequences of using alcohol at a young age; it can impact how a teen\u2019s brain develops (this is the time fine-tuning of the brain occurs), disrupt their sleeping patterns, make it harder to concentrate, increase their risk for liver and heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer. And this is just talking about alcohol, not even including all the potential drugs\n\nYou\u2019ve seen just a snap shot of what he\u2019s doing. You don\u2019t know what it means at this point. Is he recreating once a month, on the weekends, or is this an every day occurrence? How much does he indulge? Does he always know what he is consuming, drinks or drugs? Has he ever gotten to the point where he needs assistance? Over consumed? Etc\u2026 without judgement you might want to have a serious and open discussion with your son. Yes,he is technically an adult which means that these things you dismissed so easily will NOT be such an easy dismissal if for any reason law enforcement becomes involved, and actually have the potential to limit his future choices. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being hovering to have an open and frank discussion with him. And make sure he knows he can always call you anytime, no matter how late, if he ever needs you to come pick him up no questions asked. Always better to be safe.\n\nLastly, I would have a discussion with your stepdaughter about why she felt you needed to see those pictures. You dismissed her rather quickly instead of discussing anything. You have no idea if she was trying to get him in trouble or if she was truly worried about him. Which really makes me wonder \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you even consider that she could be genuinely worried for her stepbrother? My guess is she\u2019s seen your parenting style with him for a number of years now and I would assume she would know that showing you the pictures would bring forth some angry, seething monster of punishment from you, as I get that is thankfully not your parenting style at all. I figure she probably thought you would talk to him without letting him know she went to you. Maybe she was hoping he\u2019d think you stumbled onto them yourself,  I mean if he posted these images to his social media then they are out there for the world to see,right? At any rate,you\u2019ll never know her motives without having a genuine conversation. \n\nI really hope this doesn\u2019t put a permanent rift between your two kids. Family therapy might be a good idea. At the very least maybe some open family discussions with no blaming or faulting. \n\nBTW, FWIT I think the US laws on drinking are ridiculous and coupled with American views on alcohol, do little more than create an environment which fosters underage drinking and more. I agree what your son did is very typical for the age, but I would talk with him to make it is the whole story (before it does get too deep) and let him know he can talk to you without judgement.

Example: Brother John is smoking copious amounts of weed.  Sister is concerned, tells Dad.  Dad catches son coming in, asks, \"I smile weed, are you smoking pot\"?  Dad does not say, \"hey, your sister ratted you out, and said you are smoking pot\".", "There\u2019s no way it was concern when she sent it to her father after OP shut it down. That girl is a raging AH.", "No way outing someone against their will is ever an act of love. It takes a particular brand of hate to do that to someone.", "Yeah sure, the culprit needs to be the focus rather than the victim.", "When she said that \"his mom said this was OK, do you agree?\"   It went from informing parents to straight up trying to get dude in trouble.  \n\nNow also trying to not only get her dad riled up against his stepson, but now to get him mad at his wife as well.", "I understood her when she showed the stepmom. Sending them to the dad days later is what got me. She only has herself to blame. If she was so concerned, she would have messaged her dad about stepmom not caring, not about what the brother was doing. \n\nBut I do wonder if she was willing to out her brother without confronting him first, what is she willing to do to other classmates. Does she out people she doesn\u2019t like. Is she sending pics of others to classmates?", "It was easy to miss:\n\n> images of him at parties, smoking, drinking, and doing things with both genders.\n\n\"Doing things\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. It's pretty easy to imagine an 18 year old being embarrassed as fuck if his mom finds out he's bi from pictures his step-snitcher took at a party.", "It seems her peer group knows too, seeing as how she seems to have lost a number of friends.", "where else would photos be taken except at the scene", "Yeah, I had another comment that I was talking about the fact this seems based in homophobia. At least thats what my gut is saying.", "I consider snap a social. They (snap) can keep images for up to 30 days I believe and screenshots are taken and shared or snaps are shown to adults/others, which is what happened with my SD. Wherever you put it, it can resurface later or come back to bite you.", "That\u2019s still a social", "Yeah, but they're not close. It doesn't seem that they foster close relationships. I actually have a 16YO and an 18YO, and they would go to each other. Of course, I can't imagine my son \"not looking me in the eye.\" That does tell me that all is not as carefree and rosy as OP seems to think it is.", "Agree! The girl wouldn't be \"snitching\" if she didn't think that what her step brother is doing is wrong. If she was trying to \"get him into trouble,\" it implies that she thinks that whatever he's doing SHOULD get him into trouble. It sounds like she may think smoking, drinking, sexual experimentation or just posting these things on the internet isn't a good decision. In my opinion, I agree that posting pictures of yourself partying on the internet isn't a good decision, and probably should be talked about and discussed with the son. Everyone that age does these things, but putting them online where they can clearly be screenshotted and falling into the wrong hands could be risky. It also seems like the son thinks partying makes him look cool, otherwise he wouldn't post it, so seems like there could be some unhealthy ideas about what it means to be \"cool\" or to be an adult.  \n\n\nI think OP should talk to her son about why he feels the need to post these types of things on social media, and talk with the stepdaughter about what actions of his are upsetting to her. I don't like that OP automatically assumed negative intent with the step daughters actions. Has she tried to sabotage her brother before? If so, that's more understandable, but I still don't think she should just be dismissed. I know when I was 14-16, I used to try to lecture a lot of my friends who started experimenting because I was genuinely worried and confused about what I was seeing. At that age, it's difficult to understand boundaries around drinking, drugs and sexual experimentation. What is okay, and how much is okay?", "Yes and his parents clearly aren't concerned.", "So wtf. I was smoking at 18 and I lived with my parents at the time. We smokers don't wall around with a cig burning all day.", "Morality seems like very strong word here. I don\u2019t think either of the children acted \u201cimmorally\u201d. But I\u2019ve lived some time in the US and in Europe and how people are treated at age 18 is VERY different. If he\u2019s 18 in the US, and drinking, smoking etc., those are 100% illegal. Again, I don\u2019t think it was immoral of him, I did those things as a teen, too. However, I also think i\u2019m that scenario, the younger sister wouldn\u2019t be \u201cstarting drama\u201d for telling her step mother that her step brother was doing illegal things. My mom would have cared, for example, and probably at least would have told me to be wary of doing certain things when there are cameras and phones out. That\u2019s the difference. In other places, he\u2019s 18, he\u2019s an adult, he can do whatever he wants. Culturally for the US, while doing things is not necessarily unusual, I think it\u2019s okay for a family member to maybe be a bit concerned. Underage drinking is maybe even of more concern here BECAUSE it\u2019s socially less acceptable, so teens tend to behave more haphazardly to it, as they maybe haven\u2019t discovered personal limits or are more likely to binge because they\u2019re doing something taboo.\n\nSo in Europe, OP is N T A. \nIn the US? Ehhh, they were kind of a jerk to their step daughter if step daughter was genuinely concerned about his behavior. They completely dismissed any concern whatsoever, when coming from a young adult, I think a small conversation would be justified? To at least find out more details. \n\nAdd to the fact that son was embarrassed to the point of seeming ashamed tells me he felt at least somewhat guilty for what was recorded. He obviously didn\u2019t like his mom finding out, but the point is- videos spread, even on \u201cprivate\u201d social media. This time it was a step sister, but it can easily spread to anyone, anywhere. There\u2019s a lesson there, but instead step sister is getting lambasted for trying to reach out.", "The legality does change, though. I don't think OP is in the US, but here he could be arrested. That could have big implications for him down the road. It's really not about the morality for the drinking and smoking.", "She told the parents he was doing sexual things with both genders and that definitely didn't come from a place of concern. She's a gigantic asshole.", "Well we know she sent multiple pics- why did she have to send that one specifically?", "Still not her place to tell his mother", "What makes you think she hasn\u2019t had those conversations with her son? Hopefully not the comments where she said she literally has tried to educate her son on moderation and responsibility since that\u2019s literally the opposite of what you\u2019re claiming.", "So is caffeine - do you look at a coffee shop queue as a line of drug users? Jesus.", "Alcohol and nicotine or weed are not a cause for concern if used in moderation and no one is getting behind the wheel of a car. \n\nThe mother has already had conversations with her son about it and trusts him to be responsible.\n\nThe fact that part of the sister\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d was to out her step brother\u2019s sexual orientation shows you what she\u2019s really trying to do, but everyone loves to hide behind the \u201cbest interest\u201d mask.", "May I also offer some additional advice about your son??\n\nPlease talk to him about the nature of the photos. I know you say you don't want to pry into his world, but everyone is aware of the pictures so you can't just ignore them and move on. If you're accepting of his life, then please PLEASE just let him know that the pictures don't bother you and you still love him. Him avoiding eye contact could be because he doesn't know what you think of him, so reassuring him would be helpful.\n\nAnd as a different pro tip: if these pictures are posted on his social media, they aren't \"private\". I would gently suggest to him to be selective about what he posts online, because even if his account is set to private its still availailabe to everyone who has access to it, and privacy doesn't exist on social.media", "Are you in a country where outing him could get him killed?  Will he be safe?", "She's 100% trying to get the son in trouble. \n\nThe part where she says to her dad that the mom approved was next level WTF. She wasn't happy trying to screw the son over. She then tried to pit the father against the mother.\n\nMom had to put all of this behavior out in open because the sister is trying to stir up trouble behind everyone's back.", "Daughters future relationships are going to be rocky.", "I wonder if she was hoping he'd be kicked out. Maybe she wants to be the only child again.", "> don't know what her reasons may be, but she's going about it in the shittiest way possible.\n\nI bet there is a 'But he does it and you don't care' coming down the line. Ignoring the age gap", "And understandably so! Which teenager wanna be friends with a snitch like her? I probably would\u2019ve done the same when I was 16.", "I'd even argue that what she did was lawful evil. She was trying to enforce a moral code of behaviour that negatively affected those around her and doubled down when called out. OP and her husband did the right thing and respected the fact that her son is a legal adult who deserves privacy. \n\nThat little girl can sit in the mess she made and learn to mind her own business.", "No way would chaotic neutral deliberately out someone to get them in trouble.", "I haven't used traditional social media like Facebook in a long time but I remember back in the late 2000s you could tag people in pictures. If it still works that way his friends could be posting pics and tagging him.", "NTA.  Your step daughter is the snitch.  Why is she not minding her own business?  Why is she trying to get your son in trouble?  Any repercussions from this are on her.  If you don't think what your son does is your business, then that's your business, nobody else's.", ">probably at least would have told me to be wary of doing certain things when there are cameras and phones out. That\u2019s the difference\n\nWhilst I don't think I agree with your through line, I think this is a good point.\n\nI agree with David's points on morality as well, but when it comes to legality, whilst it doesn't change the fundamentals of right or wrong, it does change the stakes, potential consequences and how people respond in a situation like this.\n\nWhat OP describes the son doing at 18 just sounds like a normal (particularly good) Friday night out at a pub/club.  Have some drinks, do some kissing etc...  However in more uptight countries (not sorry for that term) then the drinking could get the son in different kinds of trouble.\n\nI do still think the step-sister is entirely the AH though and the concern is faux.", "This entire sub is about morality, not legality. Every single post here at the end of the day is about morality. Breaking dumb laws does not make one an AH. And that is a red herring to her choosing to out him which is a depraved action of hers regardless.

It\u2019s when the parent tries to be more of an equal to their kid than an actual parent. They let the kid go about their own life and only try to intervene when something super serious happens. It\u2019s really harmful for the kid in the long run. A byproduct of that parenting style is high levels of drug/ alcohol abuse and dangerous sexual behaviours, ones that are *way* past the normal teenager experimenting.", "I don\u2019t have the time to read through 900+ comments, she wanted a response to an AITA based on the information given.

The general consensus was that although the OP wouldn\u2019t be wrong or \u201cimmoral\u201d to ask for the gift back, they would be the A H given the situation. I think a similar principle applies here. No one acted \u201cimmorally\u201d but in light of, NOT because of, the societal norms given the laws around alcohol, I think the OP could be the AH in dismissing her step daughter without considering any implications.", "Yeah, you may have to reassure him more than once and give a few different ways to talk to someone about it. \n\nBut also, SD is only 16.

At least where I live, there are companies who will go through social media accounts prior to hiring someone. This could affect his future, especially if some of the things he was taking were illegal or he's underage at this time. As far as the more intimate photos, make sure he knows he needs consent from all parties involved to post them or send them to a third party. The lack of such could possibly lead to (this all depends on the laws where you are) a lawsuit from the offended party, or even criminal charges.
