Why did you tell them you have a boyfriend at the bar, or have they known this whole time? B/c the way you tell the story is that you dismissed your friend with an \"I have a boyfriend\" story in the same way most people actually do lie to strangers they aren't interested in.  (You didn't say \"Haha, interesting, but I think I'm happy with Joe\"...) Tbh, I'm not 100% sure your friends suck.  Some necessary info is missing here.\n\nThe fact that your boyfriend made no time to meet your friends in a year, and you don't have photos of him, yet shows up to come give your friends a lecture about how he really does exist is VERY unimpressive.  Why has he made no effort to meet them, before?  (Are these people actually friends, or just some acquaintances?)\n\nTbh, this is the behavior of a guy who doesn't care all that much about his relationship.  Usually by 6 months, you should have a fair number of photos, stories, and at least one or two meet-and-greets.  Secret relationships are usually low priority relationships.", "ESH. I mean I wouldnt believe you. A whole year and you dont have a photo?! Thats odd. Thats very I have a boyfriend in Canada. He sucks for how he treated your friends.

They mocked you and tried to get you to cheat on your boyfriend, then acted all haughty and superior when called out for their shit actions.

Any decent person would have just said sorry to the both of you.", "ESH\n\nAre you sure these people are actually your friends? Because their behavior says otherwise.

Truthfully if I hadn\u2019t met my friends boyfriend they claimed to have for a year, that I\u2019ve never seen or met, and then he *ever so conveniently* had a free night to lecture me on trusting friends after I finally called her on it, I\u2019d think she just paid off some guy. It\u2019s actually pretty kind that your friends didn\u2019t say anything until this night, I would\u2019ve been concerned about your mental stability after a few months. They genuinely thought you were available and were trying to help, see it from their side, your relationship probably sounded to them like something you hear on catfish that makes you think \u201cHow can people still fall for this stuff?\u201d If them believing you meant so much, it takes 3 seconds to take a photo of something.", "NTA. \n\nApparently they *do* need lectures from strangers.", "With friends like these, and so on.", "NTA. I have next to no photos of my partner, because my partner *hates* being in photos and I honor that preference. Your so-called friends are gross and they clearly don't respect boundaries. What they did is harassment and it's wrong. (And they dragged in some bar rando to boot, which, ick.)", "NTA. Shit my HUSBAND would have to pull a picture of us off of MY Facebook because he literally never takes pictures. Your friends sound immature and obnoxious.

Hmm. Back in our day, a picture was just as imaginary.  \n\n\nBut yeah, lightly, ESH. You don't have to have proof of another person for them to respect your wishes.

They didn't believe you had a boyfriend. They suck for not respecting your no.", "ESH. You made more than enough of a statement having him show up and introduce himself.

He does exist!\nBF definitely needs to learn how to make a proper first impression though.", "ESH but your bf most of all.\n\nYour friends shouldn\u2019t have pushed with the number but I can\u2019t blame them for the confusion. You\u2019ve dated for a year and he\u2019s cancelled every single time? And you have no pictures at all? And have no trace of him at your place? It\u2019s strange.\n\nBut his lecture to people he literally just met that apparently matter to you was completely uncalled for. \n\nAlso highly strange that he suddenly had a free night when you were meeting up with them\u2026", "ESH.\nYour boyfriend sounds like he needs to beg, borrow or steal a sense of humor.", "ESH. Your friends for assuming you were lying, and your boyfriend for lecturing them when he\u2019s never bothered to make the effort to meet them despite what sounds like numerous attempts to have a catch up.\n\nHowever if I was your friend I wouldn\u2019t have thought you were making him up, I would\u2019ve thought you were his side piece. Been together a year, no photos, never met your friends or shown in interest in doing so. Please tell me you\u2019ve actually met some people from his life, friends or work colleagues, and been introduced as his girlfriend??", "ESH. \n\nYour friends suck for putting you in an awkward position. \n\nYou suck for letting your boyfriend treat your friends that way. \n\nYour boyfriend sucks for the lecture on meeting them the first time. So now he helped put a bigger divide between you and your close friends instead of trying to make an effort with them. They didn't bad mouth him, they just didn't believe he existed which is kind of understandable after this much time. \n\nYou say you have been together a year and yet he has put no effort into meeting your friends, poeple who you are so close to you see every week, yet somehow he can never see them. When people care, they put in an effort for what and who is important to you, even when busy. Has he met anyone else who is important to you? Have you met people who are important to him? You say you don't take pictures so you can live in the moment but then you say you guys just hang out and chill? Do you go out to dinners? Movies? Dates? \n\nI just find it interesting that even though you hang out with your friends every week he never has a moment to make time for you and your friends. Ever heard Chris Rock's comment on this? \"If you have been dating a man for a year and you haven't met his friends, you are NOT his girlfriend.\"", "You could have jokingly introduced him as your imaginary friend. Your BF was an AH for lecturing them. His presence made the point. These are your friends and there was no need to alienate them.", "You are N T A but he's an A for immediately going on some rant to people he just met. It isn't \"immoral\" to try to set your friend up, and it isn't immoral to turn down being set up either. Them not believing you was rude but what he did is also rude.\n\nI'm going to go ESH on this one.", "Was welling to go with NTA until the lecture, now I\u2019m more of a ESH", "Esh what the hell. \n\nI can understand why they thought he was fake tbh, never met him, planned to meet him but cancelled every time, no pictures... yeah that raises eyebrows. But the way they went about it is terrible firstly thinking it *might* be fake is different to just insisting that it *is*. Secondly, the jokey attitude is problem to me. Its not like you're teenagers, a grown woman faking a boyfriend for a year is cause for concern not teasing banter. And as others have pointed out, another explanation is like he's married and doesnt want anyone to know or something. \n\nBut like... your bf going off at them was bizarre. If you were genuinely just so pissed off that you didnt wanna be mates anymore that would be one thing. But he came to meet them, as your friends, and proceeded to tell them off? Thats too far.", "ESH. You for how you introduced him. Your BF for the tirade he went on 5 seconds after meeting your friends and your friends for not believing you or taking your disinterested statements seriously. \n\nAlthough, I doubt they would have believed even a picture of him or the both of you together that he was your BF. They likely would have just thought it was a guy you knew from work or school. \n\nHospital schedules can be brutal and unpredictable and your friends need to understand that. I would consider better friends if the ones you have are going to ignore your feelings and call you a liar. Your boyfriend should have reeled in his attitude a few notches on the first meeting though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
