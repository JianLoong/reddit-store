Some necessary info is missing here.\n\nThe fact that your boyfriend made no time to meet your friends in a year, and you don't have photos of him, yet shows up to come give your friends a lecture about how he really does exist is VERY unimpressive.  Why has he made no effort to meet them, before?  (Are these people actually friends, or just some acquaintances?)\n\nTbh, this is the behavior of a guy who doesn't care all that much about his relationship.

Truthfully if I hadn\u2019t met my friends boyfriend they claimed to have for a year, that I\u2019ve never seen or met, and then he *ever so conveniently* had a free night to lecture me on trusting friends after I finally called her on it, I\u2019d think she just paid off some guy. It\u2019s actually pretty kind that your friends didn\u2019t say anything until this night, I would\u2019ve been concerned about your mental stability after a few months. They genuinely thought you were available and were trying to help, see it from their side, your relationship probably sounded to them like something you hear on catfish that makes you think \u201cHow can people still fall for this stuff?\u201d If them believing you meant so much, it takes 3 seconds to take a photo of something.", "NTA. \n\nApparently they *do* need lectures from strangers.", "With friends like these, and so on.", "NTA.

Shit my HUSBAND would have to pull a picture of us off of MY Facebook because he literally never takes pictures. Your friends sound immature and obnoxious.

It\u2019s strange.\n\nBut his lecture to people he literally just met that apparently matter to you was completely uncalled for. \n\nAlso highly strange that he suddenly had a free night when you were meeting up with them\u2026", "ESH.\nYour boyfriend sounds like he needs to beg, borrow or steal a sense of humor.", "ESH. Your friends for assuming you were lying, and your boyfriend for lecturing them when he\u2019s never bothered to make the effort to meet them despite what sounds like numerous attempts to have a catch up.\n\nHowever if I was your friend I wouldn\u2019t have thought you were making him up, I would\u2019ve thought you were his side piece. Been together a year, no photos, never met your friends or shown in interest in doing so. Please tell me you\u2019ve actually met some people from his life, friends or work colleagues, and been introduced as his girlfriend??", "ESH. \n\nYour friends suck for putting you in an awkward position. \n\nYou suck for letting your boyfriend treat your friends that way. \n\nYour boyfriend sucks for the lecture on meeting them the first time. So now he helped put a bigger divide between you and your close friends instead of trying to make an effort with them. They didn't bad mouth him, they just didn't believe he existed which is kind of understandable after this much time. \n\nYou say you have been together a year and yet he has put no effort into meeting your friends, poeple who you are so close to you see every week, yet somehow he can never see them. When people care, they put in an effort for what and who is important to you, even when busy. Has he met anyone else who is important to you? Have you met people who are important to him? You say you don't take pictures so you can live in the moment but then you say you guys just hang out and chill? Do you go out to dinners? Movies? Dates? \n\nI just find it interesting that even though you hang out with your friends every week he never has a moment to make time for you and your friends. Ever heard Chris Rock's comment on this? \"If you have been dating a man for a year and you haven't met his friends, you are NOT his girlfriend.\"", "You could have jokingly introduced him as your imaginary friend. Your BF was an AH for lecturing them. His presence made the point. These are your friends and there was no need to alienate them.", "You are N T A but he's an A for immediately going on some rant to people he just met. It isn't \"immoral\" to try to set your friend up, and it isn't immoral to turn down being set up either. Them not believing you was rude but what he did is also rude.\n\nI'm going to go ESH on this one.", "Was welling to go with NTA until the lecture, now I\u2019m more of a ESH", "Esh what the hell. \n\nI can understand why they thought he was fake tbh, never met him, planned to meet him but cancelled every time, no pictures... yeah that raises eyebrows. But the way they went about it is terrible firstly thinking it *might* be fake is different to just insisting that it *is*. Secondly, the jokey attitude is problem to me. Its not like you're teenagers, a grown woman faking a boyfriend for a year is cause for concern not teasing banter. And as others have pointed out, another explanation is like he's married and doesnt want anyone to know or something. \n\nBut like... your bf going off at them was bizarre. If you were genuinely just so pissed off that you didnt wanna be mates anymore that would be one thing. But he came to meet them, as your friends, and proceeded to tell them off? Thats too far.", "ESH. You for how you introduced him. Your BF for the tirade he went on 5 seconds after meeting your friends and your friends for not believing you or taking your disinterested statements seriously. \n\nAlthough, I doubt they would have believed even a picture of him or the both of you together that he was your BF. They likely would have just thought it was a guy you knew from work or school. \n\nHospital schedules can be brutal and unpredictable and your friends need to understand that. I would consider better friends if the ones you have are going to ignore your feelings and call you a liar. Your boyfriend should have reeled in his attitude a few notches on the first meeting though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Neither of us are really comfortable in front of a camera and when we do take pictures it's of the animals.  Don't get me wrong,  I've got pictures of her arms and stuff when the animals are being held by her.  I'm very much in the \"AND THAT'S MY WIFE\"  category but I also know my wife is uncomfortable in front of the camera", "Taken by other people and not sent to us.  But the wedding was only 6 people big lol", "None we taken on mine. It was us 2 at a JOP. No pics taken anywhere \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f we really never take pics of each other and never together. I\u2019d have to dig in a box that is who knows where from 25 years ago to see if pics still exist from the old film days in the beginning.", "> He knows he could be called out on bad behavior.\n\nWhat bad behavior? Being busy with *work*?", "They weren\u2019t bullying huh. Just being sarcastic, disbelieving, and all around entitled a-holes. Shit happens, people are busy.", "He works in a hospital.", "A boyfriend who likes his girlfriend meets her friends and doesn't forbid photos, full stop, unless he is hiding something.\n\nBeing against social media posts (for very good reason - e.g. work issues, stalker issues, etc - or simply b/c you hate it) isn't the problem. It's that he doesn't want his \"girlfriend\" (side piece) to have any ammo against him.", "I didn't miss anything....I just saw a gf standing up for her bf.\n\nSo OP has \"friends\". They give her shit because she doesn't have a boyfriend. She has a boyfriend. They dont believe it and continue to give her shit. OPs bf rips into her \"friends\" because they treated his gf like shit.\n\nDon't know how I'm not getting this.", "Dude why are you blaming her for the friends\u2019 shiftiness ! And then to ask if English is a foreign language for her ,,,, seriously check yourself.", "I said I was dating Jim, I have told stories about him before", "You have to realize though that you\u2019re the outlier, right? Not saying you\u2019re wrong or bad or anything but in the smart phone era the vast majority of people would have at least a couple of pics on their phone of a guy they\u2019ve dated for a year.", "\u201cPics or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve heard that! \ud83e\udd23 honestly, I probably should take more photos for the sake of my own memory, but yeah. Never been a big photo taker. I was dating my current GF for over a year and a half before she met my best friends. (Although I was living primarily in a different state.)", "The relationship might not be perfect, that\u2019s true. I give my friends the benefit of the doubt. Guess we just disagree on that.", "Gee, I can't imagine why he would make a point to show up face to face after they *actively tried to make her pursue someone else*.", "Well, are you telling OP to cheat?", "Upvoting for respecting the camera shy queens", "So atleast if you were in this situation and had to prove it to someone you could ask for one of them to send a photo. I agree with the comment you replied to, I'd also find it unbelievable there's not a single picture or anything after a year. \n\nPs belated congratulations! We eloped and had a small wedding when we came back, I love a nice small wedding.", "My husband works 10 to 12 hours a day in a very stressful and physically demanding job. He still makes an effort to visit with my family and friends, even when tired, even when busy. You make an effort, you take an interest in her life and those poeple important to her. \n\nHer friends got tired to hearing about this wonderful man  who never makes an effort to meet them even though they hang out weekly. He never takes a day off? He never had a holiday? He can't come out for an hour to say hi? They confronted her.", "Just imagine being a nurse. Saving lives and being forgot about after everyone clapped for you. Your gf wants to introduce you to her friends, but work took precedence. \n\nNow imagine a friend group that wants your significant other to cheat. You're not a real bf. You're a nurse. Your gf says you're her bf. \n\nShe says you have to meet them. You watch them treat her like shit and you know you are in the Am I the asshole subreddit", "Where does OP say he forbids photos\u2026 please stop projecting.", "So unless everyone complies to Away_Refuse's boyfriend goals, everyone else is wrong.", "Maybe it's my age, but if I had friends that didn't believe me when I spoke about my significant other to the point of trying to hook me up with someone, they wouldn't be my friends anymore. At the least, I'd have been giving an angry response long before, or I would have made it a big joke from that day forward about showing up with my \"imaginary boyfriend/girlfriend\" to different events and telling them stories about what me and the blow-up doll were doing later. On a separate note, are you the boyfriend? Seems that way, given your predilection for defending her like that.", "Because native English speakers don't say \"Sorry I have a boyfriend\" to their good friends. (This is a common lie people without boyfriends tell strangers that are hitting on them).\n\nShe did clarify and say that isn't literally what she said.", "There are more people like that than you think. Just look at some of the comments here, and that's only of those that feel the need to point it out. One *would* think she would have at least taken a photo just to prove she was telling the truth, though.", "I mean, maybe. Going by the comments here, then yeah. From my personal experiences not really. Maybe it\u2019s my friend group and my family but we\u2019re not big photo people. When we see each other we don\u2019t take a photo. \n\nI\u2019ve definitely had friends in relationships for a year and not seen or met their partner. I didn\u2019t accuse them of lying.", "I also don\u2019t have pics with my boyfriend of 4 years. Neither does my brother who\u2019s been with his gf for 5 years, I know so many people who don\u2019t get photos with their partners. It\u2019s life, she didn\u2019t owe them evidence by their standards", "I can give someone the benefit of the doubt, but giving that benefit for A Year is also something I would not call \u201csmart.\u201d", "So he only makes an effort to meet her friends when he feels threatened ? And you think that\u2019s cool ?", "Little black cat made a nice and detail response and that\u2019s your response to it?? Lmao. Grow up", "They\u2019re not married. The commitment at almost a year of dating is not the same. They didn\u2019t confront her: they were childish and played silly games.", "Clearly", "Ops friends are encouraging her to cheat and now the bf is the problem", "I'm a native English speaker and I've actually always tested far above average in language, and what you actually mean is that YOU wouldn't say that. I would. I know many other people who would. \n\nWhen someone is trying to pressure you into being set up, \"I am in a relationship/ I have a boyfriend\" is a perfectly reasonable thing to say ESPECIALLY if it's true, because that's RELEVANT INFORMATION.", "That's kind of an AH response.", "Yeah, just snapping a quick selfie would have cleared the whole thing up pretty quickly.", "They handed her a phone number. They voiced their disbelief in the relationship. That is all that happened. \n\nBut you're right, this relationship doesn't sound serious at all because people do put on an effort when the relationship has potential to move forward and they really like the person.  If it is just a casual relationship than this while thing is stupid.", "It doesn't even matter if boyfriend *wasn't real*. OP was clear in her communication that she was happy. Constantly going on about her boyfriend not being real and trying to push them into dating is an asshole move."]}
