You should probably wait until they are old enough to consent themselves. NTA", "NTA, but consider changing your tattoo design from names to symbols. For example, their birth flowers or your favorite animal + two baby animals, a moon with two stars, you get the idea.

I feel like this could be the way to go. If y\u2019all separate at any point you don\u2019t have any rights to his children.

Your first child is 3 years old.\n* What does your husband consider to be the solution to the jealousy concerns he mentioned? Is he suggesting you not get tattoos for any of the kids right now, or is he wanting you to get them for all the kids?", "NTA. However I do think it will harm your relationship with your step children. At the end of the day it\u2019s your body so you should do whatever your gut/heart tells you is the right thing to. However your steps kids are at too young of an age to understand and it will be confusing for them. And it does draw a bit of a permanent line between you and them. You\u2019re married. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re your boyfriend\u2019s kids. They\u2019re your husband\u2019s kids. You committed to their dad yet you won\u2019t commit to his kids. It\u2019s a bad situation.

Sounds like you're being extremely respectful to their biological mothers and you shouldn't get a permanent tattoo out of pressure from someone else. A tattoo is a big decision and as someone else mentioned, if the relationship fails like his 2 previous relationships failed, you may never see his kids again, and will have to live with that tattoo as a reminder. I'm curious what your husband would say if you asked him to get your first child's name tattooed on his chest.", "NTA but just don't tattoo your kids names. My mother did this and both my brother and I changed our names when we got older.", "NTA - 1. It\u2019s your own body. 2. You don\u2019t have the other mom\u2019s permission. However, maybe hold off getting the tattoo to think about the division it can cause later between your children\u2019s step siblings.

I'm not going to give a judgement but you should consider holding off on the tattoo idea for now. Reconsider further down the road. You're definitely risking alienating children you consider to be equal to your biological children. It would behoove all step parents to consider their step children's feelings more often. Just put a pin in the idea for now. \n\nBuild a relationship worth commemorating with them first. Just my 2 cents.", "YTA. You are sending a very clear and loud message to your step kids that you don't love them as much and they aren't as important as your kids.

The explanation could be the only kids that you are tattooing on your body are the ones that came out of your vagina.  Their birth mothers are free to tattoo them on their bodies.  Or their dad can put them on his.\n\nIt is a contentious issue.  I would not be putting a tattoo of a step kid on my body if I had them.  I have a great relationship with my stepmom but I would not be upset if my name wasn't tattooed on her body (it's not and she may have no tattoos at all... care factor is zero here).  But I can see why the kids would be a little upset... which is still not your problem.\n\nIf you were to tattoo your kids names and birthdates, then I would do it in an area that's not easily seen and small and discrete... you might also want to add more as you have more kids so make sure you have room.\n\nTattoos are pretty permanent.  Relationships can breakdown regardless of how you know them or how long you have known them.  You are least likely to want to remove the names of children you have birthed.\n\nBut I would think twice about making a big deal of this in the near future. Either do it discretely... or wait.", "That's a really good compromise, and I think the aesthetic would end up looking nicer as well.", "Love this idea", "Symbolic representations are a great idea. Could also do the dates each child became a part of your life.", "1. Almost two years \n2. This would be my 7th tattoo\n3. The same artist who did my first 7 tattoos refused to do name tattoos or any tattoos dedicated to family members or couples or etc, and I finally found a new artist. \n4. He said if I get the tattoo (even though he gave me money for said tattoo) that I should only get it with theirs as well.", "This is the best answer .  You are drawing a line between the kids.  You are either a family or not.  This move sends the wrong signal.  For that I say YATAH.", "Totally seconding this!! You need to think about how while you are contemplating your new place in their lives and vice versa... they are doing the same with a lot fewer tools and life experiences to help them. This is a big change for them, too, and they're watching how you navigate it. Kids notice way more than we give them credit for. They'll wonder why they weren't good enough, no matter how you try to explain it to them they will wonder - EVEN if you add their names later. \n\nI would think long and hard, and recommend not getting any names until you're fully aware of and prepared for the long-term consequences.", "That's why I say YTA, actually. The oldest one is five. Why did she take five years waiting to get the oldest one's name and birthdate tattooed? It would be one thing to say, I already have my oldest child's name and birthdate, and now I'm going to add the baby's. That's not the case. She's purposely doing some thing to differentiate between her biological children and her stepchildren.\n\nTattoos are not a necessity. I would put them off for a long time, until the stepchildren are old enough to understand that because she isn't their mother, she doesn't feel comfortable having their names tattooed, if that's even really the reason.", "Would you be comfortable if your ex\u2019s new husband or wife of two months got your child\u2019s name tattooed on their body?", "Your tattoo artist is right\n\nNo names.  Pick a symbol and go with that. Your kids might change their names, they might transition, etc.  Do Something Else\n\n(For example, my friend named her daughter Alexa well before Amazon took the name.  Alexa has now changed their name and pronouns to they.  An Alexa tattoo would be weird af even if she'd gotten it when they were 3. My mom grew up and goes by her middle name.  Someone tattooing her first name would make no sense now since literally nobody even remembers that name anymore. Just a couple of scenarios) \n\nBut NTA. Get whatever you want on your body, but i would listen to that tatto artist you trusted for 7 tattoos", "Thank you for your helpful responses. The most significant piece of info there (to me) is that you and he seem to be in agreement about only getting tats for your biological kids. If nothing else, that's good. Seems to me to be a NTA situation, then.\n\nAs far as what you should consider, I think it would be worth thinking about a few things as far as your timeline. On one hand, and perhaps the easiest solution if you think you're going to eventually \"get there\" with the stepkids, and feel comfortable about getting tats for them as well, is to just wait until you feel okay getting them all at once.\n\nThe other option is one of a few different kinds of compromise. The first one would be to just start with a bit a time or one at a time, so the distinction between \"your kids\" and them isn't as sharp. That is, you have two bio kids, but if you only get the 3 years birthday first, then you go back and get the name, etc., the step kids (really only the 7-year-old since the other one won't really understand) will feel like they are the same as your other bio kid who also didn't get tatted immediately, and they might better understand that you're just doing a little at a time and going in order as opposed to them feeling left out entirely.\n\nAnother idea is to include the stepkids in some capacity (again, probably more the 7-year-old) in the selection of features of the tats you get. Maybe they can help you narrow down the font or colors you are getting, etc. That way they are involved and don't feel entirely divided.", "The oldest is not five, her oldest is three.", "That's why I suggested waiting.", "Crap, I switched their ages. Still, that's three years. Why wasn't it important before she met her husband?"]}
