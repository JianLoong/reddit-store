She came over around 6:30, she had a shot of rum in some Dr. Pepper, and then we just sat on my porch and had a good conversation.\n\nAround 9 pm, we went inside and cuddled and kissed a little bit. I told her that I had a hard bedtime of 10 pm and that she would need to leave then.\n\nAt 10 pm, she said that she still wasn't feeling like herself, so we sat at my kitchen table and kept talking and I made sure she was drinking water and eating crackers. 10:30 comes and goes and she says she's still not feeling like herself. Then 11:00. We go on a little walk to get the blood flowing a little bit.\n\nAt this point, I was still being kind and supportive, but I was exhausted and my patience was gone. At like 11:15 I told her that I really needed to go to sleep and that if she didn't feel comfortable to drive soon she was just going to have to sober up in her car. She ended up leaving about 11:30.\n\nWe texted the next day and it had really hurt her feelings that I said that, which I totally understand. I really regret saying it.\n\nOn one hand, I think that I should have just stayed up to make sure she felt safe. That is the most important thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I let her know in advance of my 10 pm bedtime personal boundary. She only had one shot of rum at 6:30, and that's why I was feeling impatient with her. If we had been DRINKING drinking I think I would have been more sympathetic.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Additional info with regards to an Uber or me taking her home, she lived about a 45 minute drive away.\n\nEdit 2: I really didn't want her to spend the night and/or sleep with her tbh", "created_utc": 1688056301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m9k2v/aita_for_telling_a_girl_to_sober_up_in_her_car_so/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA sorry I am thinking she was trying to stay over and you werent into that.", "1: she was trying to sleep with you. \n2: no one is drunk for 5 hours off one shot without a medical condition. I don\u2019t even know anyone who can get too drunk to drive off a single shot.", "NTA - though it sounds to me like she was trying to get an invite to stay, so you might have missed the hint she was dropping.. But if she was really that drunk after 1 shot 5 hours earlier, she needs to go to the hospital to figure out what is going on, because there is something her body is doing wrong with processing alcohol..  She needed to get an uber home so you could sleep when you said you were tired if she had just had more to drink than you thought.", "Info: how much fucking alcohol was in that one shot of rum??\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just used to seeing people who drink a lot, but I find it seriously hard to believe that she was too tipsy to drive 5 hours after a single shot of rum.", "NTA.  One shot of alcohol at 6:30 and she claims to be too drunk to drive 5 hours later?  That\u2019s not even scientifically possible.", "NTA, just oblivious to the fact that she wanted to stay the night with you", "took her over three hours to sober up from *one drink?* okay, sure. NTA. she should know whether she can handle alcohol or not, and shouldn\u2019t burden a *stranger* on their *first date*", "NTA. If you swapped the genders I think it would become even more obvious. It\u2019s not like she mentioned a medical condition.", "NTA. She had one shot and had hours to get it out of her system. She was playing you and it seems she wanted to just spend more time with you. She was sober just being a bit dramatic or manipulative.", "NTA. On a first date, this is insane. Girl should have called an Uber if she was that intoxicated. This is a red flag imo, I\u2019d block her.", "NTA.  She is a clinger and was hoping to stay the night with you.", "NTA. She felt funny for HOURS after just one shot? Was this her 1st drink ever?? lol It sounds like she was just making excuses to try to spend the night, and got upset when you didn't take the bait. You told her right off the bat what  time she should leave and she was trying not to. I dont think you did anything wrong, but I would be on the look out for any possibly manipulative behavior flags though if you keep seeing each other.", "she had one shot of rum and it took 5 hours before she felt well enough to leave?  it sounds like this had nothing to do with alcohol, but more with her inability to take \"no\" for an answer and to respect your boundaries.\n\nYou're not in the wrong to refuse to let someone hold you hostage.  You put up with it far longer than I would have.\n\nNTA", "NAH  \n\n\nsounds like she was interested in fun bedtime stuff, but didn't want to come outright and ask, most people use dating apps as hookup apps not for actual dating , so i am sure she expected that from the beginning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One shot of rum three hours beforehand isn't going to make anybody remotely tipsy. She was just looking for an excuse to hang on and didn't respect your boundaries. When someone tries to overstep and manipulate on the first date, it's probably wise to run.", "Oh but she wanted to sleep with you!!  She sounds like a creeper.  If somebody on a date told me they had a hard and fast bed time - didn't invite me to join, I would have taken the hint and left.  \n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nSounds to me like she was trying to spend the night. Bit much for a first encounter but to each their own. In any case, neither of you were rude about what happened so best to just let it go. Maybe next time she\u2019ll leave sooner or be more direct about her intentions \ud83d\ude09", "NTA! When my ex-wife Bebecca (not her real name) and I went to Paris, we started driving back to the hotel at 8 because MY BEDTIME WAS IMPORTANT! She complained, but at least we were both well-rested!", "Info:  Why did she feel the need to bring alcohol with her?", "Info: is there a reason she couldn\u2019t crash on the couch or something? Or call her an Uber?", "It seems like one shot of rum really knocked her out. I doubt she predicted she would still feel weird at 11 something when she drank it. It would be different if she had been drinking all night, but she obviously didn\u2019t intend to violate your boundary.\n\nEither she was hoping to sleep with you, or she really was unsafe to drive. Since you couldn\u2019t know which one it was, your response was pretty, well, awful. You don\u2019t make your date sit in her car to sober up while you go to bed. I will be surprised if she goes out with you again.\n\nOn the side of hoping to sleep with you, it does seem like an Uber would\u2019ve been an obvious suggestion, but since neither of you made it, it could be that she lives too far away or something.\n\nYTA", "YTA unless you had reason to suspect she'd steal from you or worse if she crashed at your place. Idk but it sounds like she really wanted to spend the night with you and your bed time got in the way of that which comes off as strange. Although what makes you the AH isn't the bedtime thing it's sending a woman you seemingly had a good time with out in the middle of the night while she was intoxicated. I know you don't owe her decency but the least you could've done is let her crash on your couch or something.", "NTA. Girl seriously cannot hold her alcohol if she wasn't ready to leave after one shot in 5 1/2 hours- my guess is she was trying to guilt you into letting her stay over. You were very clear about your 10pm bedtime and very gracious about sticking around until 11 but she's not being reasonable. I'd take this as win- you learned a lot about her and you know you don't want a second date.", "I'm so confused by these comments. There is no universe in which she is drunk five hours after taking a single shot. NTA get your sleep king.", "I'd say YTA as she could've slept on your couch. Also everyone is different when they drink as some can handle it while others can't. Also if she was feeling sick that long bc of alcohol, she might need to see a doctor and you kinda told her to drive drunk in the process even if it's been 6 hours or whatever after 1 drink.\n\nEven if you weren't, you could have at least comforted her for one night as I'm sure she wouldn't want to sleep with you after drinking as that's a problem for both of you.", "Nta. This shit can get scary fast. Alot of people here are missing how quickly your situation with her could of landed you with a rape accusation, had she stayed the night with you. Even if she wanted it, had it not been good, she could pull that card and you'd be jn big trouble. You did the right thing.", "NTA, dude, she wasn't drunk, she was hinting that she wanted to stay over. Forget any second date.", "Just regular old 21%. It was delicious.", "It was my alcohol, we both had a shot of rum in Dr. Pepper as we sat on the porch and talked.", "I definitely could have done those things. I admit I just wanted her to leave so I could have my space and get ready for bed.", "Thanks, that's kind of what I was thinking as well. Definitely a live and learn situation. She lived about 45 minutes away.", "wow that is some INCEL BS calling someone TA for not wanting to get laid  \n\n\nit was one drink hours before plenty of time to sober up, had she had been on any medications that change that she should have said so before drinking and not had a drink.  \n\n\nyou disgust me", "Not wanting someone to stay over the first time you meet them is a totally reasonable boundary.\n\nAnd she shouldn't have been intoxicated after one drink and several hours. It also wouldn't have been the middle of the night if she'd respected his boundary of date over by 10. I'm pretty sure she was just trying to get an overnight invitation and OP is in no way obligated to give her one.\n\nNTA", "Very true. If I could do it over I would have let her crash on my couch, or just put on my big boy pants and stayed up with her.\n\nIt's the intoxication that's frustrating though, since I don't feel like one shot of rum 4-5 hours previous should have made her too drunk to go home.\n\nEither way though, I should have been a better host.", "They just met. Never mind suspicions, who spends the night on a first date?", "So wait.. one shot and after several hours she wasn't feeling OK?  I would have definitely been concerned that something else was causing her to feel badly and would have insisted on a trip to the hospital or a phone call to her parents", "I am amazed at how kind and understanding everyone is being when my mind went immediately to \"does she have an accomplice waiting for her to unlock the door and rob you after you fall asleep\".", "Tired brains make us act weird. As you say, we live and learn.", "Honestly the way i see it there's no way to know what her tolerance for alcohol was or to confirm that that was the only thing in her system at the time. She could have a medical condition, she could've ate something that didn't react well with the alchohol or she couldn't drank more than he thought she did that night. Thats why I'm saying that if Op didn't get a wierd vibe he should've let her stay. Also she could've been too nervous to drink and drive late at night. She could've had a panic attack or any number of things that could've kept her from leaving immediately. That's why i think it was important whether or not Op got a suspicious vibe from her.  To me it sounds like she was trying to see what his sheets feel like and he put her out after she told him she wasn't ok to drive. Which like that's a harsh punishment for someone wanting to sleep with you imo.", "The thing is you dont know what someone else's alcohol tolerance is really that being said she could've  pre-gamed to ease her nerves. So that might not have been the only alcohol she consumed that night. Or may be something she had before the date got her sick. But if she didn't give you wierdo vibes i think it's not unreasonable for you to have let her crash. My reasoning is that if you had a good time than you would've seen her again anyway so why not let her crash? Unless you didn't want to see her again if that was the case than you should've called an uber for her or something like that. My point is that she could've gotten hurt that night, understandably you are not her keeper but you did seem to have a good time. So to me that would warrant a bit of extra care for Courtesy's sake.", "Honestly it's not common but i know people who married the person they slept with on the first date, that's why i said that if he didn't get a wierd vibe then he's kind of an AH.", "I'm glad I'm not the only one who defaults to the terrible! Though I was thinking OP would have woken up in a tub of ice missing a kidney if she'd stayed.", "It's still her responsibility to find her way home though. She was welcome to call herself a cab/uber if she wasn't comfortable driving. OP was upfront about not wanting overnight guests.\n\nIf the genders were reversed, I'm sure people would be saying how suspicious and weird it is that a guy didn't want to leave after a first date had already run long. He'd definitely have been called a creep at the very least.\n\nMaybe this is my paranoia as a woman who has felt the need to be incredibly cautious when dating but I can't fathom letting someone I barely know spend the night after I'd made it clear I didn't want them to. I don't need a vibe for that to feel suspicious.\n\nAnd not letting someone stay even though they want to have sex with you isn't a punishment. It's a pretty important part of consent and respecting boundaries to leave someone's home when asked.", "So you are assuming she \u201cpregamed\u201d and then drove over? So what, she was trashed on the drive over, but one shot 5 hours before leaving was the tipping point?  C\u2019mon", "See I'm looking at this as a man knowing that most women don't pose much of a threat. To me he already gave her permission to he there so he trusted her enough to do so. I'm assuming Op is a good judge of character. I'm also concerned for that woman's saftey since she was claiming that she was sick and wasn't ok to drive. That being said Op said he didn't want her to stay and he didn't want to sleep with her which is fine. I think he should've just been upfront about that and told her that he wanted her to leave because he did want her to leave. Op shouldn't have stood up with her after 10 if he had already decided he didn't want any further contact with her. He should've just bit the bullet and said he didn't want her there i think she would've taken the hint after that. Although then again she could've actually needed help idk i wasn't there to gauge how sick she actually seemed and i just feel like he didn't seem to care that she could die driving home."]}
