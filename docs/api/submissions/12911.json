At first, it wasn\u2019t an issue since she would still answer my texts and calls whenever she is out at practice. For the past few weeks, she has stopped answering my texts and calls and she wouldn\u2019t receive them since I\u2019d ask her why she wasn\u2019t answering and she\u2019d claim she didn\u2019t get them. I am not stupid. Her phone is on do not disturb and none of my texts and calls are going through. I\u2019d ask my other daughters to see if they can reach out to her whenever she is out just to ask her what time she might be home. No answers. My oldest (22F) would try to call, text, FaceTime, you name it in order to ask her when she might be home. \n\nOver the weekend, my daughter had to attend an event at school and when I came to go pick her up, she went MIA and wasn\u2019t answering any of my texts and calls since again, the do not disturb feature was on. I started to get frustrated over it so when my daughter finally entered the car, I told her that she needs to start answering my calls and texts and she had no reason to ignore me when she knew I was going to pick her up. My daughter gave me the excuse of \u201coh I didn\u2019t see it\u201d again. My frustration turned into anger so I start yelling at her and said, \u201cNONE OF US ARE ABLE TO EASILY GET AHOLD OF YOU! SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY TAKES TWO MINUTES TAKES TWENTY OR MORE SINCE WE CAN\u2019T SEEM TO GET YOU TO ANSWER THE PHONE! YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN WORRIED SICK WHENEVER YOU DON\u2019T ANSWER THE PHONE!\u201d I then told her she has two choices: either she removes the do not disturb or her phone gets taken away for a week. \n\nMy daughter rolls her eyes and said it isn\u2019t fair for her to not be allowed to have the do not disturb feature. I said she needs to start answering her phone or at the very least, call us back right away. I said that if she doesn\u2019t comply, her phone will be taken away. She begged me not to take her phone so I said she needs to remove the do not disturb feature. She refused once again. \n\nWhen we got home, I told her if she doesn\u2019t want her phone taken away, she needs to remove the do not disturb feature. After some back and forth, my daughter removes the feature right in front of me before running to her room in tears. \n\nNow, before anyone thinks otherwise, I did allow her to have the phone on do not disturb as long as she answers our calls and texts. We\u2019d have to call her more than once to get a hold of her but she is completely unreachable. I think I was too harsh but I was at my wits end. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: some of you are thinking I am spamming my daughter with phone calls and texts while she\u2019s at school. I do not message her during school hours. The issue is taking place after school or on the weekends. My daughter most of the time does not tell anyone where she\u2019s going, doesn\u2019t ask for permission when she wants to go out with friends and would sneak out of the house every time her father and I are out of the house. None of my other children would have no knowledge of where she is and even they\u2019d ask her but she won\u2019t answer her phone (sometimes my son will ask her if she could buy him something from McDonald\u2019s or if they can go to target together). We did speak to her before and said she can keep her phone on do not disturb and we would never call her or text while she is in class.\n\nEdit 2: my daughter has also been lying to us about where she\u2019d go. She\u2019d ask to borrow the car to go get food, but would come home two hours later. I\u2019d call her after 45 minutes but the phone would go straight to voicemail. She normally does tell us if she\u2019s going to class or practice but whenever she goes out outside of those times and doesn\u2019t tell us, she will not answer the phone. It\u2019s like she\u2019s hiding.\n\nEdit 3: some are suggesting I take car keys away. The problem with that is, if there\u2019s a car available, she will leave. She\u2019s taken my oldest daughters car a few times and when she\u2019d ask where she\u2019s going, she would say \u201cnone of your business.\u201d My oldest hid the car keys from her and it would be met with manipulation and my daughter crying and screaming.\n\nEdit 4: as stated in the first edit, we do not text or call our daughter during school.\n\nEdit 5: my daughter takes the car WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I ARE NOT HERE and if there is another car available. If there\u2019s no car available, she won\u2019t go. My daughter is on spring break this week and I have spoken to her this morning and I have taken her car keys. She will not have it back for a long time is all I\u2019m going to say. Not until my husband and I are able to trust her again. My husband and I will have a serious sit down with her when he gets off from work this afternoon.", "created_utc": 1679487375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yh9f1/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_remove_the_do_not/", "score": 3196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she can't use it for its intended function, she doesn't need it.  The Do Not Disturb function can be set up such that priority contacts go right through it.  She is choosing not to.", "NTA.  As a parent, this is infuriating.  My kids used to do it.  There are situations where the DND function is perfectly acceptable and it has its place.  But, you are paying the bill for that phone.  She has a phone out of your kindness as a parent and she has no right to have a phone.  You have EVERY right to insist she take it off of DND.\n\nEdit:  Wow, so many YTA.  Parents get phones for their child to have some independence and connect to the world.  This parent was not overbearing and hitting the kid with calls all the time.  When a parent needs to reach their child they should be able to reach their child.  If they miss a text or a call it is understandable, it happens.  This kid was NEVER answering.  Repeat, NEVER.  The price the kids pays to have the phone is simply be accessible.  They get all the benefits of being connected to the entire world, their friends, their entire family, the internet, social media, apps, games all for the low low price of $0 and responding to mom and dad when they call or text.  Totally fair.", "NTA, and thank you for the edit, that was very relevant information.\n\nShe doesn't have any inherent right to a phone. Further, if she will not use it to communicate about important things, then there is no practical reason for her to have it. \n\nHer habits of sneaking out/sneaking around are more concerning - I'm not sure what the solution to that is, but she absolutely needs to be grounded since she is so ridiculously irresponsible.", "NTA She's deliberately choosing to make sure she's not seeing your texts. Between that and the sneaking out you have a problem here. At the very least some family therapy to see what the problem really is? But if she's not going to answer reasonable calls and texts from you then the phone needs to go and she needs to be grounded.", "NTA, but given the behaviors, I would certainly consider other, more harsh consequences for her actions.  Clearly she's being sneaky and manipulative.", "The Y T A votes are coming from teenagers. Lol\n\nNTA", "So my phone makes zero noise. Its on both dnd and silent. That means that i only get some notifs when i actually open the app theyre from and others just collect at the top of my phone in the notification bar. None of them interrupt anything im doing on my phone and again my phone makes absolutely no sounds whatsoever. So even if she doesnt get the notif immediately they are going thru and are in her notification bar, shes clearly just not looking at them \n\nThat said, you can make exceptions in your dnd settings so that certain notifs or numbers can get thru when they call/text. Assuming your kid doesnt also have her phone on silent she very much can use this setting to allow yours and her dads numbers to bypass the dnd function and she will hear those notifs. Then she can keep her dnd and have zero excuses for missingyour calls/texts \n\nEither way youre NTA for requiring your minor child to keep a viable line of communication open and available at all times", "NTA\n\n\nConcerned on what she may be hiding. Your husband and you need to have a serious sit down with her. I hope she isn\u2019t hiding something serious or mental health struggles. \n\nThough no DND unless family contacts are made priority notifications. One strike of her removing them. No DND at all or phone for a certain amount of time even.", "NTA but she didn\u2019t remove DND, she just turned it off. It can be turned right back on again.  Either way, if she\u2019s just doing whatever and not telling anyone where she is or when she\u2019s coming home you have bigger problems than her phone.\n\nIf you were calling her constantly then maybe I could see it but you were there to pick her up and you were left waiting because she was unreachable. It\u2019s rude.", "NTA. She IS hiding when she \u201cgrabs food\u201d, also she is a teen! That phone is in front of her face 24/7. She saw every single text and missed call.", "Nta the phone is to be used to get a hold of her.  She either removes the feature or gets a not smart phone that doesn't have the feature.  \n\nDoes 16, she absolutely needs to be responding.  \n\nSince she is lying about where she is, I'd also put a location tracker on it.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t follow simple rules she shouldn\u2019t have a phone. End of story. Phones, like many things, are a privilege not a right", "NTA for the intent behind it; assuming you're contacting her for genuine reasons and at reasonable times (as opposed to during classes for example), but like other commenters said this isn't an effective way of doing it.\n\nInstead of threatening to take away her phone or demanding she removes the DND feature, just have her add your number to the exemption list. Pretty much all phones have this option, though going by the ages of your children I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt in the sense that you might not be as tech-savvy.", "Nta\n\nDo not disturbo filter + a special ringtones Just for you = perfect timing for all the activities.", "NTA. She has been lying, sneaking out, and purposely ignoring you by setting the Do Not Disturb on. You and your husband should sit her down to try to get to the root of her behavior. Don't attack her, and talk to her like an adult, and let her know how worried you both are about her behavior. It might be a teen rebelling without cause, or it might be something else. Maybe she is seeing someone she shouldn't be seeing? Who knows, but family therapy might help.\n\nThe Do Not Disturb feature has filters. Add your numbers to it so she has no excuse not to answer your texts/calls.", "NTA. You've made more than one request. There's too much negotiation. Take away the phone already. I wouldn't even give her data. When you give it back, reduce her to a call and text plan. It costs about three bucks to call your wireless and lock her data usage.", "NTA, but based on your edits, this is a band-aid for a deeper problem. If your daughter won't tell you where she's going, she doesn't get to borrow the car. If she comes home much later than she said, she loses car privileges for X amount of time. If she manipulates and cries and screams for car keys and you give in, you are teaching her that she can get what she wants by manipulating, crying, and screaming. Take control of this situation and make it clear that driving is a privilege, and abusing it means she loses it.", "NTA. I'd be more concerned about the disappearing act. She's going missing for hours and taking cars without permission...you have a different sort of problem. Older boyfriend would be my guess. If you pay for the phone,  she should answer when you call but she's choosing to be rude and disrespectful. Add Life 360 to her phone and work on being more tech savvy.", "YNTA your daughter is not being responsible with having the do not disturb on. If theres an emergency then what?  If it was my kid either it stays off or there is no phone. My son is 16, he knows very well that a phone is a luxury so he knows the rules. His cell stays on silent because he doesn't want to be disturbed if his busy I get a text or whatsapp saying so then I know that he wont respond immediately. The only time he doesn't care to check his phone is when he is at home.", "NTA. Your child is still a minor and you make the rules. It is not unreasonable to say that she needs to respond to your texts so you know she is safe.", "NTA. You're the parent, you get to set the rules. But to be honest, I don't really see how taking away the phone would solve the underlying issues of her being late and unreachable. It kind of seems you need to start making ultimatums on car usage.", "NTA\n\nthe only reason a child should have a cell is to contact their parents. if she is setting it to DND and refusing to check/call back her parents she does not need a phone. let her cry it out. im not even sure why it is so important for her to have DND on? other than to avoid her parents.. she is defo sneaking around or doing something shady. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nstand your ground. you are parenting your child, good on you", "NTA, but you have more problems with your daughter than her using the do not disturb feature on her phone. You need to put a stop to her shenanigans and fast. She's heading down a bad road.", "NTA - this is called parenting. You bought your daughter a phone so you can contact her as required, she is deliberately ignoring you and lying to you about her whereabouts and where she is going with car for hours at a time (which seems like a bigger deal to me). Frankly, the actions that you have laid out need to be corrected for your daughters safety and everyone's peace of mind. Personally, I would be very tempted to take your daughters phone and add you and all your important family members to the do not disturb priority contact list so you can always get through to her, then turn on location tracking on her phone so you know her whereabouts at all times. This gets turned off when she is 18, buys her own phone and pays the monthly bill for it, or when she has actually acted in a manner suitable to regain your trust.", "Your edits make this seem way outside the scope of AITA. You need to find out what is up with your kid.", "NTA. I'm betting you pay the bill. She ought to get used to things she doesn't like, and if the do not disturb feature brings her to tears so won't her adult life.", "NTA. Was originally going YTA until I saw she doesn't answer at all and lies either outright or by omission on her whereabouts.\n\nThe thing is that if she wants to use that feature on a phone she pays for herself and then does these things, that would be a totally different issue. She'd also be living on her own, imo, in that case.\n\nI'm not a helicopter parent. But if it is an emergency, or favor or trying to coordinate transportation, I think it's extremely rude to make yourself unreachable to people that you are living with, being supported by and accommodating your schedule into theirs. Not answering a call or listening to a voicemail because you're busy or in class is one thing. Not even shooting a text when you get the chance is another. Like how hard it is, in reality, to say something like \"message received.  In class/practice/movies\"?\n\nAnd this isn't a one-off event, as you've said. It's a repeat problem you've addressed with her, and she continues to do the thing she's been asked not to do. You gave her ample opportunity to change her habit, and instead, she cried. \n\nI mean, even living with roommates, if my roommate made themselves completely unreachable unless I was face to face with them, I would get frustrated. Life and differing schedules can often make face to face meeting difficult even if you live with someone. For example, if one person works overnight and the other does mornings. If there was an emergency or there were issues with bills that needed immediate action then yeah idgaf what movie you're seeing. I don't want to be ghosted by someone I live with when their ghosting impacts me negatively.", "NTA.  You're paying for this service, at least in part, to allow her to reach you, and vice versa.  It seems like she needed to be reminded about the vice-versa part.", "I had the same problem in HS. The solution was to simply create emergency contacts for my parents so they will always show notifications on my phone regardless of DnD. Much easier than yelling or never being allowed to use the feature. NTA but you should still apologize for yelling at her. Explain that you were scared and overreacted. It happens but if you don\u2019t apologize I guarantee she won\u2019t forgive you anytime soon.", "There\u2019s a feature where you can have it on DND but you allow certain contacts to still be able to reach you. Perhaps you can come to an agreement with that!", "NTA. the teenager is being an irresponsible AH.  and before anyone else says it yes that's true with many but not all teenagers.  If she can't prove she's responsible no car no phone no activities outside of school for a while.  what she's doing can also be dangerous.", "NTA. We have the discussion about prompt replies often. I pay my rules", "NTA but it sounds like there are bigger issues happening here.", "NTA.  You're the parent and, I am assuming, the one paying the phone bill.  Your rules should stand unless she wants to pay for the phone and phone bill.\n\nBTW, most phones have a category in the contacts that bypass the do not disturb function.  My daughter's school was very strict on phone usage and noise.  She would have the phone on do not disturb throughout the school day.  My wife and I would sometimes need to message her about picking up her brother if we had a work emergency.  To make sure she got these, we were put in the emergency contacts that bypasses the DND setting.", "NTA based on your edits. But I would be a lot more worried about her behaviour in general. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue and understand why you are genuinely worried for her. Don't remove her phone - if her behaviour gets her in to a risky situation, a phone will let her contact you or the police.\nI get the inconvenience - my O/H does same though he swears blind his phone does it - and it makes simple things very hard. But then you aren't the focus of her life, something else is and be good to find out what or who that is.", "NTA\nParenting at this age is different. \nYou've lost the ability to control her, and she isn't communicating. \nTry any one of these.\n1. Do nothing. If she calls to be picked up at an inconvenient time (after not responding) let her sit for a few hours till it works for you.\n\"I left a message and offered at 6, now you'll have to wait. Give me your location and I'll be along when I can) Don't give timeliness or details. Point out how frustrating it is to have crappy communication. Improvement will be a 2 way street. Show up early as well, and let her bus/walk pr beg someone for a ride if you can.\n2.  If she fails to reply to you, she loses the phone. Like permanently. If it isn't usefull for communication between the family, it's not an expense you will upkeep. She will quickly realize how frustrating it is to have spotty communication with friends and family.\n3. She installs (voluntarily) a tracking app so you know where she is, but she can still use do not disturb. You promise not to be overbearing about it, but it's a safety plan. \n4. If she doesn't present a plan, she doesn't leave the house.\n5. You request that she be brutally honest about where she is, and you won't react. (Hmmm self control on our end is HARD!)\nBut I'd rather give a little wisdom here and there, and keep hearing about thier life, than be cut out and find out later what they're up to. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nAlso... everyone keep thier own car keys. If she take a vehicle without permission, tell her you'll report it stolen. Totally not cool.", "You have far more serious issues on your hands than you seem to realize.\n\nYou said if you try to take her keys, she will just steal any available car or have a meltdown.  She lies about where she's going, gets angrily defensive if asked, and is gone without any word for long spans of time.\n\nThis is the point where you need to be considering that something bad is going on.  Most of those behaviors have a tendency to go hand in hand with drug use.  The ones I knew would use those same methods like turning off the phone.  If they made the mistake of answering while drunk or high, you'd hear them acting strangely and know what was up, so it's easier for them to turn off phone notifications so they don't answer on impulse.  The freaking out to the point of screaming and crying if she doesn't get access to the car to go \"somewhere\" also sounds sus in the same vein.\n\nIt's hard to give a judgement because this is potentially much bigger than the initial problem.  This sounds much bigger than just a spoiled kid being willful.", "NTA to your daughter but Y.T.A. to the rest of the world if you don't get her to wake up and realize she's not some special princess who gets to do whatever she wants whenever she wants to, through lying, stealing, and manipulation if necessary, and with zero real consequences ever.

You have to remember that she is 16, and at that age, you can either trust her to make good decisions or you have bigger problems. \n\nI get emotions are running high because of her repeated bad behavior and what looks like her lack of remorse but I think you need to take a deep breath, take a step back and ask to speak to your daughter regarding what had happened. Pls apologized to your daughter for yelling at her and explain that it was a moment of anger and panic over not being able to contact her repeatedly. Explain to her calmly why it is important for all of you, especially you to be able to get ahold of her asap and set boundaries on why and how. It could something as simple as she isn\u2019t responding because she\u2019s feeling pressured or feeling like she\u2019s lacking space. I used to hate answering my mother\u2019s text or calls because she usually text in caps or raises her voice, to me, it feels like she\u2019s constantly shouting at me, turns out my mother has no idea how to turn off caps and she was shouting because she did not realized she has her phone volume down, she was under the impression that none of us could hear her because she couldn\u2019t hear us. Simple fixes, and her kids requested that she text us first instead of calling so we don\u2019t feel pressured on responding. \n\nAs for the unexplainable disappearance, I would recommend speaking to her about it calmly and move forward to a solution. Don\u2019t pry into where she\u2019s going or what she\u2019s doing. Emphasize that you love her and trust her but that behavior is alarming and worrisome. That coupled with her not answering anybody\u2019s calls or texts does not help ease anyone\u2019s worries about her. Set firm boundaries, respect her privacy and work towards a solution that both of you are happy with.", "Regarding edit 3, I'm very tempted to say e s h.  DO NOT MAKE THE CARS AVAILABLE.

You are making excuses, it\u2019s not that hard to get your teenager under control, you just need to grow a spine. If she goes anywhere without permission, she doesn\u2019t get to drive. You take away the keys to her car and call the cops if she steals another one. She doesn\u2019t answer the phone, you take it away. She throws a fit and refuses to give it to you, stop paying for it. She sneaks out, she doesn\u2019t get to leave except for school. Stop letting her cry and manipulate you like you\u2019re a child. You weren\u2019t too harsh, you haven\u2019t been harsh enough. If I did literally anything your daughter did I would have been punished immediately because my parents were concerned with keeping me safe and teaching me to be a decent human being, not being my friend, and they did not put up with any disrespect.

So daughter needs to exclude your number from her DND.  It's not hard. \n\nIn our world, I don't think it's unreasonable for a parent to be able to know where their minor daughter is after school.

Why is your daughter using this feature so much? Is everyone blowing up her phone so much that she wants to get away from it?\n\nHer behavior seems shady and you definitely have a right to be upset. It's a safety issue, quite frankly. I know the younger generation is used to having cell phones for social media, etc. But back when cell phones were first becoming popular, usually teenagers only had them as a way to contact their parents. It was the whole purpose of giving teenagers cell phones in the first place for a lot of parents, for many years. A cell phone is not a right, it's a privilege. If you can't get a hold of her, then there's no purpose in her having a cell phone at all.\n\nMaybe you should see what parental locks you can put on her phone through your cell phone carrier. Maybe your network provider will be able to give you access to her location, cell phone activity, etc. Maybe you will be able to set a network level DND between certain hours, like at night, rather than just having her do it at the device level. (If that's even a thing).\n\nReading this, I'm actually afraid for your daughter. She's definitely getting into shit she cannot handle. Unless she's disappearing to be completely alone because she's overwhelmed, to me it sounds like she's doing things she shouldn't be doing. When I was a teenager, I would come home from school and lock myself in the bathroom and pretend I had diarrhea so everyone would leave me alone for an hour. I found out recently I'm autistic and I was doing that as a defense mechanism because I was overstimulated. So if she's running off to be completely isolated from everyone because she doesn't want to be around people, I think that might be indicative of a larger issue that she's not handling well alone.

They are learning to regulate their emotions and have a developing brain.

I find it very worrying that at 16 she has so much to hide. Yes, 16-year-olds need some privacy, but her behavior sounds like it has entered the \u201crisky\u201d territory.

You\u2019re the parent. You\u2019re allowed to act like it.", "Honestly if you\u2019re going to take away her phone, restrict her outings so she can\u2019t go off on her own. Ask her older sister to make she doesn\u2019t leave, and if she does, contact you. This isn\u2019t normal teen behaviour", "I don\u2019t think getting rid of the phone entirely is the way if you have a kid who runs off with no heads up about where she\u2019s going. Either put a tracker on the one she has (let her know it\u2019s there but choose one she can\u2019t delete without your parent set password). Or I\u2019d get rid of the smartphone and give her an old flip phone that she can only really use to be contacted. Takes away the ability to download apps where she can hide her convos, like signal or the like, where she can keep all of her convos private and hidden. (My parents did this to me as a teen. It was mortifying but obviously I survived.) Now I\u2019m not a proponent of going thru ur kids phone, but as someone who got into my fair share of trouble, it might be warranted, especially once you get the flip phone and can plainly see her texts minus all of the apps. Don\u2019t do it behind her back, tell her you have to for her safety because you can\u2019t keep worrying like this and you don\u2019t want something awful to happen like getting kidnapped. We always think we\u2019re invincible as teens, and it only takes a traumatic event to take that feeling away and I\u2019d hate for your daughter to go thru something traumatic that takes her spirit away. Be honest with her and say you understand how she feels, but as her parents it\u2019s your job to do things you don\u2019t necessarily want to in order to keep her safe. Don\u2019t judge her or make her feel more afraid to come to you. You have to strike a good balance between enforcing your rules while also leaving the door open for her to confide in you if she\u2019s experiencing some problems. Also, put a tracker on all of the cars if u take the flip phone route as a way to keep track of her. And this way she can\u2019t put the phone on dnd. She might still not answer, but with the excuse of do not disturb gone, you get down to the issue and maybe can figure out patterns to when and how long she won\u2019t get back to you. Or, she will just get back to u bc she feels defeated by having a flip phone. Could go either way. I would enlist her siblings to get as much info as possible. Have them talk to her friends and try to figure out where she goes. If nothing else works, you\u2019ll have to ground her with the condition that grounding isn\u2019t over until she admits where she goes and how she\u2019s been spending her time. I hate offering controlling parenting advice, but with so many dangers out there and a kid who sneaks away every chance she gets, doesn\u2019t pick up her phone, and doesn\u2019t let anyone know what she\u2019s doing, you have to show them that you\u2019re not going to be tricked by their antics. Hopefully she will eventually tell u where she\u2019s going. Idk if the grounding idea and negotiating to end grounding by being honest with what she\u2019s doing will work, but it\u2019s still worth a shot. If nothing else you have to make sure that she doesn\u2019t have access to cars so she can\u2019t just take off. Even if that means parking the spare car somewhere else and maybe getting a temp parking spot for it so she can\u2019t just take the extra car. And car keys can\u2019t just be left around anymore out in the open for her to see. Remove triggers. Maybe that\u2019ll mean that she needs someone to pick her up which might give you clues about what she\u2019s doing. The main thing is making it as hard as possible for her to live her life under the radar as she has been. Kids deserve privacy but safety is more important sometimes, and this is one case where that applies. You might want to get an at home drug kit and test her for drugs. It\u2019s a possibility, but if anything can rule that out. And if u do find she\u2019s been smoking some weed. Don\u2019t go down hard on her for that. There are bigger scarier drugs to worry about and jf the results for those tests are negative, praise her since she\u2019s been getting a lot of negative attention. The main thing is u don\u2019t want to go too far in the direction where she doesn\u2019t trust u anymore so she has to know this is all done with love even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it. Ask her what she\u2019d do if her daughter was doing the same. Just try to reach her in a way that makes sense to her. Ask her what she\u2019d do if she had a bff who was behaving similarly and was worried about her. I hope you\u2019re able to figure out where she\u2019s going. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s either a boy or she\u2019s hanging with the wrong crowd and maybe hasn\u2019t yet started but is thinking of beginning to experiment. You would know best if she seems at all under the influence of something. Just stay on her and let her know you will have to continue to do so until she can be upfront about what she\u2019s been doing, and hopefully she will eventually tell u and u can take it from there. I would also highly recommend therapy, and bringing her there and picking her up so u know she went. She might need a nonjudgmental space to process whatever she\u2019s going thru and if there\u2019s anything going on that\u2019s a risk to herself or others, the therapist will have to notify you. If there\u2019s nothing like that happening, then maybe you can learn more in time. Be open to family therapy. You can ask questions there and she will feel safer bc she has a mediator there to help her communicate herself in a way her parents might not understand. But therapy is essential. And no bad kid torture camp boarding schools like those Provo schools. They\u2019re abuse laden and they lie to parents and kids and torture them while there. So don\u2019t do that. You could look into a legit kind of one week nature excursion where she has to get in touch with nature and might help ground her. Just do a ton of research and make sure it\u2019s not a creepy abusive place they won\u2019t let her out of for years. I know people who went to those and it made them worse. Even Paris Hilton went to one as a teen and has been deeply traumatized ever since. So if u pick a nature retreat make sure it\u2019s reputable and kids come home after one week.  Anyway, I wish y\u2019all luck and safety for your daughter. Keep us posted if you can!", "The edits certainly change the range of issues going on here. This is a teen who is already out of control.

As a parent I know the pressure nowadays to be this picture perfect, gentle, kind, understanding parent who \u2018gets it\u2019 when teens act out. But that\u2019s unrealistic. Kids and teens need boundaries, they need structure, and they need to understand that behaviors have consequences.

The consequences would have been severe.\n\nI do think there's a limit to how much you can really \"control\" a 16 year-old (and I don't really think good parenting is \"controlling\" in nature), but this is a direct danger to the daughter whether she realizes it or not.

Something is going on with her that she doesn't want her parents to find out", "It\u2019s trauma. Kids are growing up in a world that is dying and were told point blank their lives are less important than capital during the pandemic. They had their entire lives upended. They know they will die of climate change or facism or be forced to work a dead end job. They\u2019re lashing out because they have no future.", "As many others have said, this is not about the DND feature. She's choosing to ignore the texts and calls. Something is going on with her and you need to find out what", "No they weren\u2019t. Almost every statistic about safety has gotten better over the last couple decades.

Back then we had those cellphones that could only call people. I would ignore my parents just because I felt like it that day. \n\n\nDoesn\u2019t have to be so extreme\n\nEdit to say: I was also doing bad things \ud83d\ude02 but that wasn\u2019t why I didn\u2019t answer the phone", "This is by far the worst response ive seen that you could have to this situation.", "This is insanely abusive.", "This is actually an insane overreaction.  I ignored my parents calls/texts and I was just shit talking my friends and playing video games.", "Lmao, instant arbitrary conclusions and really shitty advice even though no one here has any clue what's really going on. And of course heavily upvoted. AITA at it's 'finest'.", "What? How did people manage before phones?

I don't use it so I can't tell you how to turns it on, but I know the people who are technically knowledgeable will be able to help you.", "I am disgusted at this comment. This is such toxic, manipulative and controlling behavior. You do understand if she does this, her daughter will always remember it and this will hurt their relationship further, no? \n\nYou sound like you would be an awful mom, but you\u2019re just a kid so you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. \n\nIt she has a bf that is absolutely normal and she does have to share everything with her mom. Wanting to know everything about your child is abusive, she is her own person and she can make her own decisions.\n\nJumping to the conclusion that there are drugs involved? Really? If she raised her daughter well that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nDisgusting.", "This is the answer. Take it from a former sneaky af teen and extremely secretive adult: she\u2019s hiding something. Do everything this person suggests.", "Drugs was where my mind went immediately while reading the edits. The over-the-top reactions, lying, manipulating, sneaking around, and being constantly out of contact\u2026 that\u2019s certainly what this feels like. Addiction would explain a lot of the above. NTA, OP. But however possible you need to find out what is going on with your daughter.", "This is the best answer.", "Right? My phone is always on dnd. It just means it doesn't vibrate or ring, or sends a pop-up notification, but I still get every single message and call so I don't understand what they're talking about.

Either way, the actions OP has edited to say she's doing sound like the best solution.\n\nI wonder if having her phone on 'do not disturb' can hide your location?

My main comment called that out. The adult gets them the phone specifically to reach them, and then turn that feature off immediately. Sounds like the parent should take their phone.", "iPhone does have this feature. You can set it up to do this.", "I was having this same thought.

They'll find her for OP and she can explain why she stole a car after being escorted back home by the cops.\n\nAbsolutely do not do this. They will not always escort your kid home.

Both times, he was out past curfew, and I just checked to make sure he was moving. He uses it more than I do. If I'm 2 minutes later than usual, he's on the app and waiting at the carport. Same with my niece. If I tell her I'm on my way, she watches the app until I get there. If I stop, she calls me asking why I stopped. She's 11.\n\nI think as long as it's not used to punish or control, it's not as horrible as people think it is.", "Yeah JFC no do not lie to the police as a means of punishing your child. Is there any scenario where that ends well?", "I\u2019m glad that worked out for you, but countless other kids are physically and sexually abused in those programs. You cannot guarantee good outcomes for ANYONE engaging with they system. In this case, that includes criminal justice and social services.", "Yeah. I actually was a police dispatcher for many, many years and was the one who took the information and entered the vehicles into the system as well as I was the one took the stops over the air.

I'll give the kid a joy ride, but if it had been such an issue his dad was A) to the point of actually calling cops on him, letting him sweat it out in holding and B) that wasn't enough of a wakeup call for him to straighten his act out.... That's kind of on Neal there not the dad.", "/j right? Because scared straight does not work and many people who were on the show either ended up worse or with trauma/mental health issuss", "How do so many of you pedantic nerds not understand the difference between what the law says and what the reality is?\n\nYou know perfectly well that a child taking a car without permission is not the same as a random person stealing your car. Stop pretending it is. \n\nThe cops will understand the difference, they\u2019re not going to appreciate you inserting them into your parenting issue, and they will take that out on you and your kid."]}
