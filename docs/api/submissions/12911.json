At first, it wasn\u2019t an issue since she would still answer my texts and calls whenever she is out at practice. For the past few weeks, she has stopped answering my texts and calls and she wouldn\u2019t receive them since I\u2019d ask her why she wasn\u2019t answering and she\u2019d claim she didn\u2019t get them. I am not stupid. Her phone is on do not disturb and none of my texts and calls are going through. I\u2019d ask my other daughters to see if they can reach out to her whenever she is out just to ask her what time she might be home. No answers. My oldest (22F) would try to call, text, FaceTime, you name it in order to ask her when she might be home. \n\nOver the weekend, my daughter had to attend an event at school and when I came to go pick her up, she went MIA and wasn\u2019t answering any of my texts and calls since again, the do not disturb feature was on. I started to get frustrated over it so when my daughter finally entered the car, I told her that she needs to start answering my calls and texts and she had no reason to ignore me when she knew I was going to pick her up. My daughter gave me the excuse of \u201coh I didn\u2019t see it\u201d again. My frustration turned into anger so I start yelling at her and said, \u201cNONE OF US ARE ABLE TO EASILY GET AHOLD OF YOU! SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY TAKES TWO MINUTES TAKES TWENTY OR MORE SINCE WE CAN\u2019T SEEM TO GET YOU TO ANSWER THE PHONE! YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN WORRIED SICK WHENEVER YOU DON\u2019T ANSWER THE PHONE!\u201d I then told her she has two choices: either she removes the do not disturb or her phone gets taken away for a week. \n\nMy daughter rolls her eyes and said it isn\u2019t fair for her to not be allowed to have the do not disturb feature. I said she needs to start answering her phone or at the very least, call us back right away. I said that if she doesn\u2019t comply, her phone will be taken away. She begged me not to take her phone so I said she needs to remove the do not disturb feature. She refused once again. \n\nWhen we got home, I told her if she doesn\u2019t want her phone taken away, she needs to remove the do not disturb feature. After some back and forth, my daughter removes the feature right in front of me before running to her room in tears. \n\nNow, before anyone thinks otherwise, I did allow her to have the phone on do not disturb as long as she answers our calls and texts. We\u2019d have to call her more than once to get a hold of her but she is completely unreachable. I think I was too harsh but I was at my wits end. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: some of you are thinking I am spamming my daughter with phone calls and texts while she\u2019s at school. I do not message her during school hours. The issue is taking place after school or on the weekends. My daughter most of the time does not tell anyone where she\u2019s going, doesn\u2019t ask for permission when she wants to go out with friends and would sneak out of the house every time her father and I are out of the house. None of my other children would have no knowledge of where she is and even they\u2019d ask her but she won\u2019t answer her phone (sometimes my son will ask her if she could buy him something from McDonald\u2019s or if they can go to target together). We did speak to her before and said she can keep her phone on do not disturb and we would never call her or text while she is in class.\n\nEdit 2: my daughter has also been lying to us about where she\u2019d go. She\u2019d ask to borrow the car to go get food, but would come home two hours later. I\u2019d call her after 45 minutes but the phone would go straight to voicemail. She normally does tell us if she\u2019s going to class or practice but whenever she goes out outside of those times and doesn\u2019t tell us, she will not answer the phone. It\u2019s like she\u2019s hiding.\n\nEdit 3: some are suggesting I take car keys away. The problem with that is, if there\u2019s a car available, she will leave. She\u2019s taken my oldest daughters car a few times and when she\u2019d ask where she\u2019s going, she would say \u201cnone of your business.\u201d My oldest hid the car keys from her and it would be met with manipulation and my daughter crying and screaming.", "created_utc": 1679487375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yh9f1/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_remove_the_do_not/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she can't use it for its intended function, she doesn't need it.  The Do Not Disturb function can be set up such that priority contacts go right through it.  She is choosing not to.", "NTA.  As a parent, this is infuriating.  My kids used to do it.  There are situations where the DND function is perfectly acceptable and it has its place.  But, you are paying the bill for that phone.  She has a phone out of your kindness as a parent and she has no right to have a phone.  You have EVERY right to insist she take it off of DND.\n\nEdit:  Wow, so many YTA.  Parents get phones for their child to have some independence and connect to the world.  This parent was not overbearing and hitting the kid with calls all the time.  When a parent needs to reach their child they should be able to reach their child.  If they miss a text or a call it is understandable, it happens.  This kid was NEVER answering.  Repeat, NEVER.  The price the kids pays to have the phone is simply be accessible.  They get all the benefits of being connected to the entire world, their friends, their entire family, the internet, social media, apps, games all for the low low price of $0 and responding to mom and dad when they call or text.  Totally fair.", "NTA, and thank you for the edit, that was very relevant information.\n\nShe doesn't have any inherent right to a phone. Further, if she will not use it to communicate about important things, then there is no practical reason for her to have it. \n\nHer habits of sneaking out/sneaking around are more concerning - I'm not sure what the solution to that is, but she absolutely needs to be grounded since she is so ridiculously irresponsible.", "NTA She's deliberately choosing to make sure she's not seeing your texts. Between that and the sneaking out you have a problem here. At the very least some family therapy to see what the problem really is? But if she's not going to answer reasonable calls and texts from you then the phone needs to go and she needs to be grounded.", "NTA, but given the behaviors, I would certainly consider other, more harsh consequences for her actions.  Clearly she's being sneaky and manipulative.", "The Y T A votes are coming from teenagers. Lol\n\nNTA", "So my phone makes zero noise. Its on both dnd and silent. That means that i only get some notifs when i actually open the app theyre from and others just collect at the top of my phone in the notification bar. None of them interrupt anything im doing on my phone and again my phone makes absolutely no sounds whatsoever. So even if she doesnt get the notif immediately they are going thru and are in her notification bar, shes clearly just not looking at them \n\nThat said, you can make exceptions in your dnd settings so that certain notifs or numbers can get thru when they call/text. Assuming your kid doesnt also have her phone on silent she very much can use this setting to allow yours and her dads numbers to bypass the dnd function and she will hear those notifs. Then she can keep her dnd and have zero excuses for missingyour calls/texts \n\nEither way youre NTA for requiring your minor child to keep a viable line of communication open and available at all times", "NTA\n\n\nConcerned on what she may be hiding. Your husband and you need to have a serious sit down with her. I hope she isn\u2019t hiding something serious or mental health struggles. \n\nThough no DND unless family contacts are made priority notifications. One strike of her removing them. No DND at all or phone for a certain amount of time even.", "NTA but she didn\u2019t remove DND, she just turned it off. It can be turned right back on again.  Either way, if she\u2019s just doing whatever and not telling anyone where she is or when she\u2019s coming home you have bigger problems than her phone.\n\nIf you were calling her constantly then maybe I could see it but you were there to pick her up and you were left waiting because she was unreachable. It\u2019s rude.", "NTA. She IS hiding when she \u201cgrabs food\u201d, also she is a teen! That phone is in front of her face 24/7. She saw every single text and missed call.", "Nta the phone is to be used to get a hold of her.  She either removes the feature or gets a not smart phone that doesn't have the feature.  \n\nDoes 16, she absolutely needs to be responding.  \n\nSince she is lying about where she is, I'd also put a location tracker on it.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t follow simple rules she shouldn\u2019t have a phone. End of story. Phones, like many things, are a privilege not a right", "NTA for the intent behind it; assuming you're contacting her for genuine reasons and at reasonable times (as opposed to during classes for example), but like other commenters said this isn't an effective way of doing it.\n\nInstead of threatening to take away her phone or demanding she removes the DND feature, just have her add your number to the exemption list. Pretty much all phones have this option, though going by the ages of your children I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt in the sense that you might not be as tech-savvy.", "Nta\n\nDo not disturbo filter + a special ringtones Just for you = perfect timing for all the activities.", "NTA. She has been lying, sneaking out, and purposely ignoring you by setting the Do Not Disturb on. You and your husband should sit her down to try to get to the root of her behavior. Don't attack her, and talk to her like an adult, and let her know how worried you both are about her behavior. It might be a teen rebelling without cause, or it might be something else. Maybe she is seeing someone she shouldn't be seeing? Who knows, but family therapy might help.\n\nThe Do Not Disturb feature has filters. Add your numbers to it so she has no excuse not to answer your texts/calls.", "NTA. You've made more than one request. There's too much negotiation. Take away the phone already. I wouldn't even give her data. When you give it back, reduce her to a call and text plan. It costs about three bucks to call your wireless and lock her data usage.", "NTA, but based on your edits, this is a band-aid for a deeper problem. If your daughter won't tell you where she's going, she doesn't get to borrow the car. If she comes home much later than she said, she loses car privileges for X amount of time. If she manipulates and cries and screams for car keys and you give in, you are teaching her that she can get what she wants by manipulating, crying, and screaming. Take control of this situation and make it clear that driving is a privilege, and abusing it means she loses it.", "NTA. I'd be more concerned about the disappearing act. She's going missing for hours and taking cars without permission...you have a different sort of problem. Older boyfriend would be my guess. If you pay for the phone,  she should answer when you call but she's choosing to be rude and disrespectful. Add Life 360 to her phone and work on being more tech savvy.", "YNTA your daughter is not being responsible with having the do not disturb on. If theres an emergency then what?  If it was my kid either it stays off or there is no phone. My son is 16, he knows very well that a phone is a luxury so he knows the rules. His cell stays on silent because he doesn't want to be disturbed if his busy I get a text or whatsapp saying so then I know that he wont respond immediately. The only time he doesn't care to check his phone is when he is at home.", "NTA. Your child is still a minor and you make the rules. It is not unreasonable to say that she needs to respond to your texts so you know she is safe.", "NTA. You're the parent, you get to set the rules. But to be honest, I don't really see how taking away the phone would solve the underlying issues of her being late and unreachable. It kind of seems you need to start making ultimatums on car usage.", "NTA\n\nthe only reason a child should have a cell is to contact their parents. if she is setting it to DND and refusing to check/call back her parents she does not need a phone. let her cry it out. im not even sure why it is so important for her to have DND on? other than to avoid her parents.. she is defo sneaking around or doing something shady. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nstand your ground. you are parenting your child, good on you", "NTA, but you have more problems with your daughter than her using the do not disturb feature on her phone. You need to put a stop to her shenanigans and fast. She's heading down a bad road.", "NTA - this is called parenting. You bought your daughter a phone so you can contact her as required, she is deliberately ignoring you and lying to you about her whereabouts and where she is going with car for hours at a time (which seems like a bigger deal to me). Frankly, the actions that you have laid out need to be corrected for your daughters safety and everyone's peace of mind. Personally, I would be very tempted to take your daughters phone and add you and all your important family members to the do not disturb priority contact list so you can always get through to her, then turn on location tracking on her phone so you know her whereabouts at all times. This gets turned off when she is 18, buys her own phone and pays the monthly bill for it, or when she has actually acted in a manner suitable to regain your trust.", "Your edits make this seem way outside the scope of AITA. You need to find out what is up with your kid.", "NTA. I'm betting you pay the bill. She ought to get used to things she doesn't like, and if the do not disturb feature brings her to tears so won't her adult life.", "NTA. Was originally going YTA until I saw she doesn't answer at all and lies either outright or by omission on her whereabouts.\n\nThe thing is that if she wants to use that feature on a phone she pays for herself and then does these things, that would be a totally different issue. She'd also be living on her own, imo, in that case.\n\nI'm not a helicopter parent. But if it is an emergency, or favor or trying to coordinate transportation, I think it's extremely rude to make yourself unreachable to people that you are living with, being supported by and accommodating your schedule into theirs. Not answering a call or listening to a voicemail because you're busy or in class is one thing. Not even shooting a text when you get the chance is another. Like how hard it is, in reality, to say something like \"message received.  In class/practice/movies\"?\n\nAnd this isn't a one-off event, as you've said. It's a repeat problem you've addressed with her, and she continues to do the thing she's been asked not to do. You gave her ample opportunity to change her habit, and instead, she cried. \n\nI mean, even living with roommates, if my roommate made themselves completely unreachable unless I was face to face with them, I would get frustrated. Life and differing schedules can often make face to face meeting difficult even if you live with someone. For example, if one person works overnight and the other does mornings. If there was an emergency or there were issues with bills that needed immediate action then yeah idgaf what movie you're seeing. I don't want to be ghosted by someone I live with when their ghosting impacts me negatively.", "NTA.  You're paying for this service, at least in part, to allow her to reach you, and vice versa.  It seems like she needed to be reminded about the vice-versa part.", "I had the same problem in HS. The solution was to simply create emergency contacts for my parents so they will always show notifications on my phone regardless of DnD. Much easier than yelling or never being allowed to use the feature. NTA but you should still apologize for yelling at her. Explain that you were scared and overreacted. It happens but if you don\u2019t apologize I guarantee she won\u2019t forgive you anytime soon.", "There\u2019s a feature where you can have it on DND but you allow certain contacts to still be able to reach you. Perhaps you can come to an agreement with that!", "NTA. the teenager is being an irresponsible AH.  and before anyone else says it yes that's true with many but not all teenagers.  If she can't prove she's responsible no car no phone no activities outside of school for a while.  what she's doing can also be dangerous.", "NTA. We have the discussion about prompt replies often. I pay my rules", "NTA but it sounds like there are bigger issues happening here.", "NTA.  You're the parent and, I am assuming, the one paying the phone bill.  Your rules should stand unless she wants to pay for the phone and phone bill.\n\nBTW, most phones have a category in the contacts that bypass the do not disturb function.  My daughter's school was very strict on phone usage and noise.  She would have the phone on do not disturb throughout the school day.  My wife and I would sometimes need to message her about picking up her brother if we had a work emergency.  To make sure she got these, we were put in the emergency contacts that bypasses the DND setting.", "NTA based on your edits. But I would be a lot more worried about her behaviour in general. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue and understand why you are genuinely worried for her. Don't remove her phone - if her behaviour gets her in to a risky situation, a phone will let her contact you or the police.\nI get the inconvenience - my O/H does same though he swears blind his phone does it - and it makes simple things very hard. But then you aren't the focus of her life, something else is and be good to find out what or who that is.", "NTA\nParenting at this age is different. \nYou've lost the ability to control her, and she isn't communicating. \nTry any one of these.\n1. Do nothing. If she calls to be picked up at an inconvenient time (after not responding) let her sit for a few hours till it works for you.\n\"I left a message and offered at 6, now you'll have to wait. Give me your location and I'll be along when I can) Don't give timeliness or details. Point out how frustrating it is to have crappy communication. Improvement will be a 2 way street. Show up early as well, and let her bus/walk pr beg someone for a ride if you can.\n2.  If she fails to reply to you, she loses the phone. Like permanently. If it isn't usefull for communication between the family, it's not an expense you will upkeep. She will quickly realize how frustrating it is to have spotty communication with friends and family.\n3. She installs (voluntarily) a tracking app so you know where she is, but she can still use do not disturb. You promise not to be overbearing about it, but it's a safety plan. \n4. If she doesn't present a plan, she doesn't leave the house.\n5. You request that she be brutally honest about where she is, and you won't react. (Hmmm self control on our end is HARD!)\nBut I'd rather give a little wisdom here and there, and keep hearing about thier life, than be cut out and find out later what they're up to. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nAlso... everyone keep thier own car keys. If she take a vehicle without permission, tell her you'll report it stolen. Totally not cool.", "You have far more serious issues on your hands than you seem to realize.\n\nYou said if you try to take her keys, she will just steal any available car or have a meltdown.  She lies about where she's going, gets angrily defensive if asked, and is gone without any word for long spans of time.\n\nThis is the point where you need to be considering that something bad is going on.  Most of those behaviors have a tendency to go hand in hand with drug use.  The ones I knew would use those same methods like turning off the phone.  If they made the mistake of answering while drunk or high, you'd hear them acting strangely and know what was up, so it's easier for them to turn off phone notifications so they don't answer on impulse.  The freaking out to the point of screaming and crying if she doesn't get access to the car to go \"somewhere\" also sounds sus in the same vein.\n\nIt's hard to give a judgement because this is potentially much bigger than the initial problem.  This sounds much bigger than just a spoiled kid being willful.", "NTA to your daughter but Y.T.A. to the rest of the world if you don't get her to wake up and realize she's not some special princess who gets to do whatever she wants whenever she wants to, through lying, stealing, and manipulation if necessary, and with zero real consequences ever.

Explain to her calmly why it is important for all of you, especially you to be able to get ahold of her asap and set boundaries on why and how. It could something as simple as she isn\u2019t responding because she\u2019s feeling pressured or feeling like she\u2019s lacking space. I used to hate answering my mother\u2019s text or calls because she usually text in caps or raises her voice, to me, it feels like she\u2019s constantly shouting at me, turns out my mother has no idea how to turn off caps and she was shouting because she did not realized she has her phone volume down, she was under the impression that none of us could hear her because she couldn\u2019t hear us. Simple fixes, and her kids requested that she text us first instead of calling so we don\u2019t feel pressured on responding. \n\nAs for the unexplainable disappearance, I would recommend speaking to her about it calmly and move forward to a solution. Don\u2019t pry into where she\u2019s going or what she\u2019s doing. Emphasize that you love her and trust her but that behavior is alarming and worrisome. That coupled with her not answering anybody\u2019s calls or texts does not help ease anyone\u2019s worries about her. Set firm boundaries, respect her privacy and work towards a solution that both of you are happy with.", "Regarding edit 3, I'm very tempted to say e s h.  DO NOT MAKE THE CARS AVAILABLE.

We\u2019d call her but there\u2019s no answer so when she comes home, we\u2019d tell her what\u2019s taking so long but she won\u2019t tell us.", "Evidently they were calling during a school event the 16 year old was at on a Saturday.   Depending on the event type I can see situations where she may not answer.  Kinda depends on the event type", "I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore.", "Those were also safer days", "The comments are really crazy here. I grew up with a phone but my parents were so much more chill...", "I understand that. I don\u2019t know if I was clear, I\u2019d tell my daughter to come home after a certain time and when she isn\u2019t home, we simply want to know when she\u2019s returning since she\u2019s running late.", "that\u2019s an explanation/excuse ONCE, not when it is happening routinely across locations.", "My husband and I do not call her all the time. It\u2019s only when she isn\u2019t replying to my ONE message. After an hour or sometimes two hours, we still won\u2019t get a response. We do not spam her with calls, we give her the space she needs to enjoy herself. It\u2019s just that when she isn\u2019t back yet at a certain time is when we start worrying.", "It would help by not wasting money on something that is not being used properly or with respect to the people paying for it.", "I don\u2019t know about the rest of it but in this specific instance the parent had to wait around until the daughter sauntered over at her leisure because the parent couldn\u2019t get ahold of her. That is completely unacceptable. I would have left her at school to make her own way home but that\u2019s just me. Sure - use the Do not disturb function - and face the consequences.", "I discovered that option where my I can still call my daughter. My oldest has that feature. Her phone is on do not disturb except for me, her father and her siblings. \n\nI am not texting my daughter during the day or at school. The issue is when she is out with friends or she goes out to get food and isn\u2019t back home on time yet. I\u2019d tell her be home by 9. If it\u2019s 9:20 and she isn\u2019t back, we start calling and she doesn\u2019t answer.", "Maybe they have no faith and trust in her because she keeps showing them they shouldn\u2019t? That\u2019s how it works.", "She was at a school event. Not in school. There\u2019s a big difference.\nHonestly I don\u2019t know anyone who would pay for a child to have a phone and not expect them to respond to repeated missed calls and texts. \nIf the daughter can never be reached on the phone when necessary, she doesn\u2019t need a phone.", "Please link one of these phones that doesn't have DnD", "Actually I just read your edits and you seem to have a much bigger problem that you aren\u2019t really dealing with, good luck", "Why are all these kids leaving DND on all the time?!? So they can\u2019t get contacted? They just want it for internet?! I don\u2019t get it\u2026\n\nI hate how old I\u2019m getting\u2026", "We made our kids sign a \u201ccontact\u201d when they got their phones and they know that as long as we are paying for the phone they have to follow the rules/guidelines we listed.", "You need to ground her, take her phone, hide all the keys, and maybe get her therapy. She's hiding something, and it may be drugs or alcohol or she may have a secret BF. \n\nI recommend, when you take her phone you could put a tracking app on it I you can't trust her enough or you can put a tracker in the car she uses the most or on the keys so you can see where she is going. Unfortunately, this is controlling, but she won't tell you anything, and it's for her safety. If she goes missing, having her location will be a big help.", "My phone has a setting where you can select specific people or set it too all people to get through DnD if they called twice within a certain timeframe (android) \n\nSeems a very easy solution", "[removed]", "From the sound of the edits, you have more issues than the do not disturb feature. NTA but I think the focus should be on her general behaviour including stealing her sisters car or manipulating people into getting what she wants. I'd be interested (coz I'm nosy!) in whether this indicative of a wider issue and how are you parenting her through it.", "So; funny thing. My iPhone goes though with the do not disturb is on. Like anyone can call/text me and I\u2019ll get it. NTA, install Life360", "Sounds like she has lost the privilege to drive or to have a phone until she can learn to be responsible.   NTA", "In school, yes. But not after school when your mom is trying to find you for pick up.", "Are their consequences for the meltdowns over a sibling rightly not letting daughter take their car?", "This is a refreshing and intelligent response from someone who is the daughters age. Thank you for this and understanding that parents are allowed to worry. You sound like an amazing kid!", "I get that people do not enjoy tech but finding out how to do those things is a 5 minute read after a google search.  \nAnd there are many surveillance apps for parents. There are targeted for parents who give phones to younger persons but if she cant be trusted about her whereabout that's one solution.  \nI would also not let her borrow the car if she doesnt tell you where she is going with", "Many types of emergencies can happen at any time. If there is an emergency and she is ignoring her calls and messages then she is being irresponsible. I suggest you go back and read the edits. Family does not blow up her phone when she is at school its after school that is a problem. Also she is 16 are you saying that at that age a teenager should not know how to handle emergencies. Tell me if God forbid something happens and a family ends up in hospital is that not an emergency?  So to you emergencies which is a reality in life is having a twisted view, so please explain to me your views on emergencies being a bed of roses \ud83d\ude44", "Based on your edit about her taking the other siblings car - your daughter needs therapy. In no way if I ever talked to my parents with a \"none of your business\" would I be allowed to still go out anywhere. Throwing a manipulative tantrum at her age is unacceptable. She is almost an adult. You are only setting the stage for her to act like a brat the rest of her life by not being serious about her problematic behavior.", "WHY are you still letting her take the car? One time with that nonsense, and she should be grounded. If she's not where she's supposed to be, then she doesn't get to go out again until she can be trustworthy.   \nSomething is going on here, and you owe it to her to figure it out.   \n\n\nYou realize you're the parent here, right? Why are you acting like you're afraid of her?  \n\n\nNTA, but sheesh, stop letting the tail wag the dog.", "Yikes. Sounds like she shouldn't get to borrow the car if she's going to lie about where she's going", "You focus on the wrong problem than.\n\n\nThe problem is her being late and her not getting in contact with you.\n\n\nThere should be consequences for being late/ not telling you and not for the phone being on do not disturb.", "You can set it up so certain contacts' calls and messages actually still come through even while on dnd fyi! But it sounds like there's a lot of conflict and it's not really about the do not disturb feature. I hope things get better", "i think if you can talk to her and maybe do a only one call to check with her when she'll be home and if shes late you can call her again then? also do try to change the settings so your number goes through even on dnd if she agrees but that might be worth a try if shes willing to listen to your idea to make it work otherwise goodluck with dealing with it \ud83d\ude05", "I get it, I\u2019m a parent as well but sometimes you just need to let it go, relax and pick your battles.  You parent the way you feel necessary but we have all been there where time has gotten away from us.", "How often are you sending that \"One\" message, as you put it?", "Yes she was at a school event on a Saturday. My husband and I would never call or text her during school hours.", "... so what sort of event could a student just get up and take a call? Where I live we had sport events, where we didn't have our phones on us, or we had thearter plays, work shops, etc where we definitly werent allowed to just take a call. \n\n\nI seriously courious- do students just take calls at events at school where you live?\n\n\nIn my mind she was at the event. The event ended. She saw the calls and went to her moms car. A totally normal way of behaving.", "Could also just be because alert sounds are annoying and you don't want to listen to a billion of them over the course of the day, or you don't want to risk disturbing others with your audible alerts or vibrations. I think OP is probably NTA, I just think there's good reasons to have DND on :P", "I mean, I'm 30 but getting spam calls and texts to my pocket instead of on a landline where they don't disturb me during the day is the worst modern development we've made. I never thought of leaving DND on because I do have important calls coming, but I could see where you don't plan on getting \"important\" calls as a kid.", "That seems pretty extreme to say on its own, but based on OP's edit it actually sounds like the most likely possibility. The phone is probably the least of OP's worries at this point, there's almost certainly something going on with that kid.", "Stolen comment from u/many_hobbies_gal.", "Yeah my notifications all come through, I just don\u2019t get a sound or a buzz, I use it after a certain time of night so I don\u2019t get woken up by my games telling me that my lives have refilled or what have you.", "There seems to be a lot of \u201coh well what can we do?\u201d going on, and no consequences at all.", "OP and the rest is the family, since she\u2019s got them sending messages on her behalf - so this includes the requests to buy McDonald\u2019s.", "At a sports event I was absolutely expected to respond if I was attending as a spectator. At no point does OP say their daughter was acting in a play or playing basketball. She also could have been at a school dance. \nAt the end of the day it\u2019s extremely disrespectful for the child to ask to be picked up at a certain time, then not only miss that pick up time but also be unreachable while their parent is looking for them. I understand OP being concerned in this situation because weird shit happens all the time and something could have happened, even at the school", "Vibrate? I literally never have the sound on for my phone ever.", "But you can custom set alerts and vibrations (or lack thereof). I don\u2019t leave my phone on DND but I do have one person I don\u2019t want to block but who contacts me incessantly. So I have their ringtone set to silent with no vibrations.", "> At first, it wasn\u2019t an issue since she would still answer my texts and calls whenever she is out at practice.\n\nExcept she does say practice. That indicates the daughter is participating. So it\u2019s not likely she got tired of / got in trouble for always answer the phone when busy.", "The incident where OP blew up states she was \u201cattending\u201d an event at school. \nThis does not exclusively indicate she was playing or performing anything for this event. \nOdds are just as likely she was at a school dance or spectating. If OP adds info that the child was actively participating in a sporting activity or performing with the band it\u2019s a different story.", "Thank you :) \n\n\n\nAnd her daughter being late (generally as it seems) is an entirely different problem as the phone.", "However, I still say OP is NTA. The child is incessantly unreachable at a phone line that the OP pays for. She sneaks out of the house and lies about where she is. If she\u2019s not using the phone anyway she doesn\u2019t need it", "It honestly sounds more like a teenager being a teenager, but based on the capitals OP is losing her mind over having to wait 20 MINUTES for\nher to respond.", "I do agree it\u2019s very possible OP overreacted in the heat of the moment. However it sounds like this has been a long and difficult battle with the daughter and this was a breaking point. It seems to me OP has made multiple attempts in the past to reason with the daughter about this issue and it\u2019s fallen on deaf ears. Yes that is a teenager thing. But that doesn\u2019t excuse her to do whatever she feels whenever without consequences"]}
