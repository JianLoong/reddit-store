You shouldn't be taking him in after how he's been acting. You are not responsible for his behavior.", "Nta your brother needs to get his shit together, him being kicked out was his doing not yours.

You had nothing to do with that.  This is all on your brother.  You did a very nice thing for your father by fixing up his place.  That also had nothing to do with him being kicked out.  Your older brother is completely wrong in blaming you.  Whoever takes him in will have to deal with the same things that your father did.  The brother should be working and supporting himself.  Do not fall for the guilt gave your older brother is playing.  He is probably already sick and tired of the younger brothers behavior at his home and is hoping to pawn him off on you.  It is time for baby brother to grow up and take care of himself.", "NTA. His room didn't get updated because of his behavior, mouth and attitude. I'm sure it wasn't just the look of his room that caused your father to kick him out of the house and there is no reason that you should have to take in the little ungrateful jerk. At his age, he should either be in school or learning some kind of trade or working and learning to support himself. He shouldn't be living off of others and expecting everyone to take care of him. \n\nMaybe you could fix up his old room in your father's house to help your father out. But I don't think you owe your brother anything.", "NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong. If you don\u2019t want to help your brother you don\u2019t have to. He is old enough to have a job. He is old enough if he wanted his room redone he could have helped you with the remodel and ask for his room to be added.

You\u2019ve been a good son to your father, and modeled good behavior for your younger brother, and it is not your fault he refuses to take a lesson from you.\n\nTell your older brother are not the reason your younger brother got kicked out, if your dad got fed up with his behavior, then good for him, and you are not going to be taking any lazy moochers into your home for any reason. Tell him (and the rest of your family) you understand why your older brother is unhappy your younger brother is now mooching off of him and making a mess of his home, but if he ever again tries to blame you for anyone else\u2019s choices and behavior (including his own), you\u2019ll end the conversation immediately and maintain minimal contact until he apologizes. And the same goes for anyone else in the family. Then, stick to that plan, and enjoy going to visit with your dad in his nicely upgraded and moocher-free home.", "NTA. His been thrown out was entirely his own doing. And let your other brother keep him.", "NTA\u2026. Your older brother took in your younger one and now he is stuck with your lazy brother.

But the conditions are that he must first work the same job for 10 weeks, pay you a $3,000 security deposit, buy his own food, and sign a month to month lease for market rate.

At that point you will sit down and agree on a rental agreement and the contingencies involved. Or\u2026..if you have some cash to burn, say you\u2019ll give him a loan for first and last on a apartment that he can get approved for by himself.  If you want everyone to shut up. \n\nAnd on another note, what has your brother done to change any of his behavior to become a responsible adult. Ask your older brother where younger one is working now. Also say everything is contingent on passing regular and random drug tests.

You went above and beyond for him. The fact that your brother is doing nothing with is life is not your problem, but maybe going above and beyond for him will help him finally grow up.
