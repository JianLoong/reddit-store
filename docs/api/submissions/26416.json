I bought a house a year into our relationship and she moved in with me about 9 months ago.  She has lived in apartments her entire life so she was extremely excited to have actually have space and a yard to call her own.  My house had an existing fenced-in garden area that the previous owners had let go into disrepair.  I am not a green thumb by any means, so I didn't do much with it either.\n\nWhen my GF moved in, she wanted to get the garden up and running again, so that was our Spring project.  We cleaned everything out, tilled the soil, and set up a few raised beds for veggies and herbs.  But my GF also wanted to get chickens.  I was hesitant to agree because I have a dog who I let out into the backyard and I don't know how he would react to chickens.  But instead of just saying \"no,\" I told her we need to look up ordinances and laws first and go from there.\n\nWithin hours she had found all the city ordinances and laws about backyard chickens and showed them all to me.  Apparently, we can have 3 chickens (no roosters) in their yard.  I told her she can have 2 chickens, but she has to pay for everything related to them and as far as I'm concerned, they are her pets to care for.  \n\nSo, she bought a coop with a fenced run area (that I had to assemble and set up heating), and we put it in the garden so that my dog could still have access to the yard without harassing the chickens.  She started letting the chickens out of the coop so that they could roam the yard (she calls it free-range), and after some introductions with my dog, they seemed to get along fine and my dog leaves them alone.  \n\nHowever, I didn't know how much chickens poop.  It's everywhere.  If you don't clean it up every day, it's everywhere.  With my dog, I go out there once or twice a week and pick up after him because he only goes in 1-2 spots.  But the chickens poop literally everywhere they go and you have to keep up on it much more often.  I complained to my GF about it multiple times and told her she needs to either keep them in the garden or clean up after them every day but she usually only does it when I pick up after my dog, or sometimes I just end up doing it.  \n\nShe won't keep them in the garden because they peck at the veggies and herbs.  She won't keep them in the coop because \"they've become accustomed to free-range and it makes them happier\" according to her.  \n\nWe had another fight about it the other day because I stepped in chicken poop while wearing sandals and it's gross.  I told her if the chickens are going to be in the yard, then she needs to pick up after them every single day.  She told me it's unreasonable to expect her to walk the entire yard everyday cleaning up poop when I only clean up after my dog twice a week.  \n\nI told her she either cleans up after them every day, keeps them in the coop or garden, or they're gone.  She thinks I'm being an AH about this and that I hate her pets and just want them gone.", "created_utc": 1694113291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cn4cy/aita_for_making_my_gf_clean_up_after_her_chickens/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has pushed the envelope way too far here to be making any more demands. If this was an unexpected consequence of something you both equally wanted then sure, you should compromise. But if you've only been supportive and never actively wanted chickens then it's only reasonable she should give a little ground here. \n\nThat being said here are some compromises you could try if you haven't already:\n\n- Is it possible you could extend their run a bit to give them more space? \n\n- Could she only let them roam the yard a few days a week? That way she would only have to clean up on those days instead of daily. \n\nOtherwise I completely agree with the ultimatum you've given her.

You laid out ground rules before she even got the chickens! If you had multiple dogs, you sure as hell would be picking up poop far more often... but that isn't the case.

What you need is called a chicken tractor.  It is basically a small movable coup that you can put anywhere you want in the yard, let the chickens free range and when you want to, relocate it.  The chicken droppings are great fertilizer (only after composting) and will make the grass a lush green.  The trick is, just put the tractor in spots where you never intend to walk, or at least out of the way.  Have you had the eggs yet?  Once you do, you will LOVE those chickens!  Each hen will give you (usually) about one egg per day.  There is nothing that compares to farm fresh eggs!", "Chickens pee and poop at the same time - one hole for everything.  There is no picking it up by hand.  You need to contain them.  You can contain free range hens.  You need either a tractor or a fence . . . chicken wire?  As long as the hens have plenty of room to run around and eat grass and bugs, they will be happy.  Fenced in hens are still free range!", "There **HAS** to be a compromise here, chicken poop stinks and they go literally everywhere. Letting them shit all over the yard is not way to live but **neither** is picking up every poop daily. \n\nShe said they can't stay cooped all day, and I agree, but is there a middle ground? \n\nIs there a section or corner of the yard you can fence in/block off with chicken wire, so they can still be outdoors and keeps the poop in 1 spot?\n\nWhat about running chicken wire around the perimeter of the yard, a few feet in, so they can roam freely but you're not restricted in your own yard, or at risk of stepping in the poop? \n\nHosing down the yard should work to break it up and disperse it but that would probably soak your grass too much and uses a LOT of water. Pickup up after chickens doesn't seem to be very common or realistic, so your best bet is having a designated pooping spot for them to stay.

Your dog's poop is sitting out there marinating for days, that's gross too. If neither of you want to pick up poop every day, neither of you should own an animal that poops. Grow up, both of you.", "ESH \n\nI WANTED to say n t a but I can't because you are holding her to a higher standard than yourself. \n\nIf you want her to pick up after her pets every single day you need to pick up after your pet every time he goes out. That's all there is to it. \n\nYeah it sucks to be stepping in bird poo, but you know what also really sucks? Stepping in dog poo.

I had horses, we had to clean up their stalls and their turn out area everyday multiple times a day - so I just laugh on that \"why I am suppose to clean after them everyday\". Thats part of the package. Chicken poop is a fertilizer when used appropriately (hint, diluted and not fresh) - when there is to much of it - its chemical weapon. Fresh poop from both chicken or other birds can eat away paint on the car - its that chemically aggressive. But frankly speaking, I would not tolerate the dog poop  accumulation also. Even if its not easily seen - it still smells and pollutes soil. And its much easier to clean up.", "NTA She just doesn't get it.

I'm not trolling you dude, and I'm not angry. I was baffled by how indignant you are about refusing to clean up 4 day piles of rotting dogshit in your yard.\n\nStatistically speaking your girlfriend probably eats less than you. Does that mean that she can leave her dirty dishes in the sink for days, piling up and rotting, all because she \"doesn't snack as often\" and her pile isn't as big as yours? It doesn't matter what the comparative frequency of snacking is. It's still leaving gross shit out rotting for 4 days. \n\nAll the best to you. We disagree. I do think your GF needs to take responsibility for the chickens, but as a fellow dog person, I feel that your inability to understand the need to clean up after your own pet, and expecting your poor dog to crawl back into a concentrated pile of his own rotting shit in order to poop in a pre-designated \"small area\" you don't think you should have clean much is revolting.", ">I expect he is far short of everything she wanted.\n\nExcuse me, I'm 6'3.", ">I expect he is far short of everything she wanted\n\nMmm hmm.

This other redditor has only confirmed my suspicions that I am useless to my GF unless I can provide her with space for her chickens. /S", "You\u2019ve only got his side of the story.  It doesn\u2019t paint an attractive picture of him.\n\nI think she should dump him and should easily be able to do better.  Focusing on her own career is also a great idea!", "But what would she do with her chickens?!  Won't somebody please think of the chickens?!", ">I think she should dump him and should easily be able to do better.\n\nMaybe if you concentrate really hard and post several dozen more delusional comments about it, you'd be able to telepathically communicate this with her."]}
