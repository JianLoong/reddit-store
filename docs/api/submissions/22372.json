Rue has always been destructive, and Luke has always been less than forthcoming with paying up for the things she's broken, though to be fair we have never asked him to. This time, however, seeing in 4k how malicious Rue was and how Luke has done nothing to curb her behaviour over the years, I was extremely angry. Also, there is a piece of one of the items she broke that we've been unable to find, which will up the cost of repair, and a couple of dress up items were custom made.\n\nLuke was extremely apologetic but I told him the only way to make this right would be to pay for what got ruined, and I presented him with an itemised invoice. Luke said he didn't have that kind of money readily available, but I am adamant that he and Rue cannot keep acting like these things don't have consequences. I said either he pays, or he can find somewhere else to stay for the duration of the holiday or go home. He has said he will contact the bank tomorrow for money but he is very upset about it and is accusing me of sinking him into difficult financial straits.\n\nMy parents think I am in the wrong for threatening to kick him out if he doesn't pay. They think I should ask for only what he can comfortable afford to pay, and that maybe I shouldn't invite them back but they think I shouldn't ruin a trip that's already started. Ana is stuck in the middle, she agrees that Luke doesn't do enough about Rue's behaviour but is worried how this is going to affect everyone's relationships, and also if they'll be able to afford the second trip they had planned for the summer break. Rue has been sulking and crying pretty much non stop since it happened which has put Luke even more on edge.

My poor destroyed credit score. \ud83d\ude01\n\n\nLuke needs realize that soon, it could be destruction of property over X amount which is a felony. These types of kids are the ones who grow up to key cars, destroy the house with a party, purposely throw expensive equipment, in their fits.  And then are outraged anyone who want them to pay for it. The WHOLE amount (and possible jail time too).   Is she gonna tell the judge she\u2019s only comfortable staying one night at jail and then she\u2019s good? \n\nBut since she\u2019s not your kid, make it NOT your problem. Tell him small claims court can garnish his wages in an appropriate increment if he\u2019s worried about \u201cyou taking advantage\u201d. And then never invite them back", "NTA, both Luke and Rue have got to start facing the consequences on her actions. Maybe offering a compromise so the rest of the family don't suffer as a result, a payment plan for instance, but something needs to be paid now and an agreement needs to be in place and consequences for is its not stuck to.", "NTA. And what\u2019s important here is that your daughter sees that you\u2019re standing up for her and that, even if it\u2019s a family member, nobody has the right to treat her or her property like that. Make him pay for ALL of it because it sounds like even if he does, he\u2019s still getting off easy since he hasn\u2019t had to take responsibility for anything his daughter has ruined before this.", "NTA BUT - you did say you never asked him to pay for things before. He clearly demonstrates an avoidant parenting style and his kids walk all over him. Just keep in mind that you didn\u2019t ask them to pay before and now you are asking to pay.\n\nWhat you could do is make him pay 50% of the damages then state that next time he is paying 100%. Then you look like you compromised and he knows that next time it\u2019s all on him. Also it may force him to parent his child when she visits.\n\n9y/o is way too old for that type of destructive behavior. Sorry you are dealing with that, you are not doing anything wrong by standing up for your child, I am only pointing out that to compromise for the family, this is one option where you are setting the tone for the future but also putting the onus on him to fox the situation moving forward", "NTA.

Maybe now he will actually do something about her.", "NTA\n\n>He has said he will contact the bank tomorrow for money but he is very upset about it and is accusing me of sinking him into difficult financial straits.\n\nThat's unfortunate, but the bottom line is that his kid destroyed several things that aren't hers and he needs to pay for their replacement. He doesn't get to wriggle out of it because it means he might not be able to afford to pay for their second summer trip.\n\n>they think I shouldn't ruin a trip that's already started.\n\nIt was ruined the minute your BIL kicked off about being held responsible for his kid's destructive actions. Your parents need to stay in their lane.\n\n>Ana is stuck in the middle, she agrees that Luke doesn't do enough about Rue's behaviour but is worried how this is going to affect everyone's relationships\n\nAna shouldn't be \"stuck in the middle\" of this situation. She needs to step up with her husband to deal with their daughter's behaviour instead of blaming you for any fallout that asking for money might cause. *\\[EDIT\\] I misread the OP. It has been pointed out that Ana is Rue's step-mother and therefore has limited authority, so I take this comment back.*\n\nAlso, since this is a pattern of behaviour, how does your sister think Rue's behaviour has affected other people? How often has she broken others' things in the past with absolutely no recourse?\n\nHopefully this is a wake-up call for your ~~sister and~~ BIL to get some help for Rue.", "NTA you need to stand up and protect your child first. If you let this go, think of what your child will feel", "NTA. A 9-year-old knows that what she\u2019s doing is wrong. BIL needs to enforce consequences with her.", "I can understand a toddler being destructive. But a 9yo? Such behaviors in a child who is old enough to know better are an alarm bell that BIL is ignoring. Not parenting her daugther is not the solution. Whether Rue is petty because she has anger issues or because she has some other kind of problems, it's clear that it hasn't been addressed (I put my money on the divorce of the parents). Is she in therapy?\n\nMeantime you have the right to protect your properties and not to accept this behavior in your home (it is something parents have to fix in their home) and to ask for money for what has been broken.\n\nNTA", "This is a tough situation. I\u2019m one hand, they\u2019re just toys. It\u2019s not worth putting someone into financial ruin over toys. On the other hand, however, maybe this will finally get your BIL to start attempting to correct this behavior. Breaking someone else\u2019s things like this, especially at 9 YO, is gonna set her up for something bad in her future, especially because she\u2019s getting close to a more difficult age for many parents to deal with.

I did it without being asked.

Would the other people let him go without paying for the damages.

If it's not much, you have to let it go.  Kids break things. If it's a lot of money, you should think about why you have that out and available in a child's play room.  A member of your family is saying he has to contact the bank and the amount of money will put him out? You are the AH if you make him pay. It doesn't sound like you are hurting for money in any event.\n\nI'm not saying you don't have the right to be upset or the BIL shouldn't talk to let punish their daughter, but you just have to put the expensive stuff away or not invite them over again for next time.", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
