You said she appeared maliciously destructive; like perhaps a child taking out frustrations from jealousy (likely exacerbated by parents). \n\nI'd instead encourage you talk to him again about how he can get her to pay for some of it (again, the wealth gap between the two of you is high, so it may be better to settle for less). Something like having her perform tasks like dishwashing, laundry, and sweeping in your home(or whatever number of chores is appropriate); while they stay there. Make it very clear, she has to be the one to earn the family's graces. That way it is encouraged by her father; ie she is pushed into having to work for it; dissuading her from breaking anything else.

Financial hardship is really bad, and it may drive a bigger divide than you want, overshadowing the lesson they need to learn.

I would offer Luke that he can pay it off in rates, so his and his family's summer, etc is not completely screwed. Lola prolly doesn't deserve the punishment. At the same time I would make clear to Luke that the money is not as important (though also important), than him not letting it slide for Rue to damage what she wants, and that in the future, when she does, she, and in extension her parents, will have to bare the consequences, not you. I think you were more than patient enough.  \n\n\nAdditionally, also Rue's mom, Luke's ex wife, is co-responsible, and he should discuss it with her to split the bill, if anything Rue's mother should be held responsible, too, though INFO would be needed, how parenting is split between Luke and her, but if it is a somewhat normal situation, they both are responsible, divorced or not.", "NTA!!!", "Nta- time to pony up for never disciplining his child.", "NTA tell your parents to pay since they are so concerned about his finances.
