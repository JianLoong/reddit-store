Ana is stuck in the middle, she agrees that Luke doesn't do enough about Rue's behaviour but is worried how this is going to affect everyone's relationships, and also if they'll be able to afford the second trip they had planned for the summer break. Rue has been sulking and crying pretty much non stop since it happened which has put Luke even more on edge.

This was the newest system that I had saved up to buy him for Christmas just a few months ago, and I was exhausted from working so many hours, so I was PISSED.  \n\nI took the games away from him, and sat him down with my paystub.  I explained gross pay, taxes, and benefits in ways that impacted him (this $200 comes out of Mom's paycheck so you can see a doctor when you are sick, for example).  Then I explained that the net pay is what I actually get to spend money on.  And we compared that to the cost of the videogame system that I had bought.

New things will take longer to wear out, will last longer, and your daughter will have more opportunity to play with them in the long run. That's why (again, at least US) standard insurance covers things the way they do. It's not at all fun to have to replace things you make insurance claims on, and it can feel very unfair in the moment to have to put up more money just to replace things you wouldn't have needed to replace otherwise - but the default insurance coverage operates that way because otherwise your insurance company would not just be covering what you actually owned, but what you owned and then some. This happens in the insurance context even when someone else is the cause of your loss. Often when you make a claim in that kind of a situation (not here probably, not worth the cost with the low dollar amount and the nature of the loss, but in bigger disputes) often once you make an insurance claim, they'll just go after the other person's insurance company to cover what they pay you.", "Then you\u2019re being a bit of an asshole.

I too have a step grandson who was violent at school and he verbalizes just fine. The issue, it seems, is the inability to control his emotions and to verbalize about them. My grandson had many altercations with the police before the age of 10 and the school had absolutely failed to educate him. They fed him candy all day to keep him quiet and he couldn't even read. Police often said to \"beat his ass\" until he submitted. That never worked, not once.\n\nThose parents need access to some place that is dedicated to educating and evaluating the autistic. We have been able to accomplish this by forcing the school district to send him to a residential school (my DIL got tipped by a knowledgeable teacher who was concerned) that delved deep into all those medications, violence and educational issues. He's about to turn 14 and has only been on one medication prescribed by a board of psychiatrists and physicians and he is now just about up to speed on his education. They have been a godsend. Now when he gets angry, he has self-coping skills that he uses. He hasn't been violent at all anymore.\n\nDon't blame the parents.

But if the principle is something like, 'your daughter willfully destroying things damaged not only what I owned but also caused me pain and suffering - you need to make me whole for both,' then I could see more than the actual value being asked for - but because, as you said, higher insurance premiums and paperwork aren't worth it to you, I guess I'm not sure how much your trouble here should be valued at. I don't mean that in a snarky way - I just think that it's worth ruminating on exactly what principle you're trying to stand on and what you want him to be responsible for, especially in a context like this where relationships are important and complicated.", "Also \"not my pig, not my farm\".", "[deleted]", "I work with kids with these issues and I will make visuals for kids even if they are fully vocal.

Everything Rue destroys, someone else has to foot the bill for, and always has (mind you, all this stuff is replaced with brand new versions). My point is that Luke can't go around thinking that what Rue does has no consequences. Conservatively, I'd estimate she's ruined 10k worth of stuff, not including the 2.5k of Charlotte's things she's wrecked most recently and I think he should know what it feels like to be on the hook for his daughter's poor behaviour, like the rest of us have been for years.", "Also \"not my ear, not my wax\"", "Genius!

When I was teaching, in lower elementary, children whose behavior was deliberately abusive or hurtful, was something I worked on with the abusive child. I had them write about what they did. \"I damaged Ana's beautiful dress. I did it on purpose and it was no accident.\" The identification of the deliberate behavior can be very difficult for a child to say or write about. They never want to admit what they did. This is difficult for them. Then they would have to identify that what they did was hurtful. \"I destroyed a dress that I knew was very important to Ana, and I wanted to hurt her by doing it.\" Then the child would have to tell what their motivation was, if we could get to the heart of it. One of the things that I never required was an apology, no \"I'm sorry,\" because that is not necessarily genuine, but is forced on them. I would have them identify what they will do going forward. \"I will leave all of Ana's belongings alone from now on, and I will not damage any of them.\" Then Rue needs to have a face to face conversation with Ana with an adult watching, supervising.", "ESH \nBrother needs to control child, and child should learn a lesson, but making the father pay will teach the 9 year old nothing, and honestly just seems really materialistic", "I appreciate the toys are your property and your niece Rue broke them intentionally.

If it wasn\u2019t on camera, he\u2019d be acting super offended at the suggestion that it was his perfect angel.", "He still should pay for the damage in full. But it might not be a failing of parenting but an underlying issue that can't be parented away and needs medical intervention. \n\nIf it's actually a medical problem (mental health etc), then maybe you could say you are willing to set up a payment plan for the full amount that is financially more possible for him under the condition that the kid is taken to an evaluation and regular therapy.", "Just curious, have you talked to Rue when others are not close, asked her why she would do something so mean and uncaring?  If my child did something like this I would make immediate attempt to remedy it fairly and we would be having some serious talks, so I feel for OP, this is serious and needs to bee nipped in the bud.  I agree with those saying this is a cry for help, wow naughty little Rue.", "Being poor is not having the money to put food in your family\u2019s mouths. Being poor is struggling to keep a roof over your head. Being poor is not struggling to go to portugal a second time.", "4 years prior to getting preggo with Lola, Rue was probably an adorable 4-5 year old  who didn't realize that her parents would put her on the back burner for their new families \ud83d\ude44 I'm guessing many of the behaviors began when her mom and then dad popped out kids.", "Okay, whatever, you could look for ways to smooth same things over, but if you're really looking for more family drama absolutely this is the best way to go about it.", "Unfortunately, you maybe do need to have a lock on the door, if you intend to allow Rue to ever come back. It doesn't need to have a key, but a latch or a bolt high up on the door, that Rue can't reach. It would provide a bit of security for your kids and for yourselves.", "I don't think you understand what that term actually means.", "Not sure if the cow and the bull would be in the same pasture....", "She did it because she was upset about Luke practicing german with Charlotte, at least that's what I believe as that's what happened right before. She got upset she couldn't understand them, or maybe Luke told her they were busy (I was out of earshot), and right after she went inside and destroyed all the stuff. She's prone to tantrums when she doesn't get someone's undivided attention the second she wants it.", "Yes, that is poor. Less poor also exists. It\u2019s possible to scrape up the cash to take your family on a trip now and again and still be poor. This isn\u2019t the \u2018sucks-olympics\u2019.\n\nPlus, this was a driving trip to stay with family, not (assuming US) a flight to europe. Making up extreme shit is a desperate look.", "Good idea. Some chores with a $ amount attached so she doesn\u2019t expect daddy to pay her accidents/mistakes. This will let her take some responsibility for her actions.", "One of us doesn't, and the downvotes might indicate who.", "Not my banana, not my peel.", "No, you don\u2019t. It does not confer automatically.", "Yes. It does. So long as the bio mother or father give you that blessing, you are a legal guardian to your step kid without any other legal paperwork. A quick Google search would show you this but ok. Be wrong bud.", "INFO:\n\nOut of curiosity what was the total of everything? Your NTA. However me personally, I would not get my kids something that was so expensive. Out of fear they would break it themselves.", "About 2.5k total.", "then maybe he should be a damn parent and not let his bratty kid destroy other people\u2019s property.", "That\u2019s the mindset of  someone that can\u2019t take accountability", "So you excuse bil behaviour", "Did you read the post? The financial strain is them potentially not being able to take a second trip.", "How? He didn't make his daughter do this and has tried to get her to stop before? This is absolutely an unexpected cost he didn't anticipate + the threat of losing the trip entirely if he doesn't get the money. A payment installment plan would've solved OP's issue of wanting the damage paid for and I don't think the other dad would've had a problem with repaying gradually because he sounds like a decent dude in general, the threat to the trip was unnecessary like OP's parents' said, yeah the daughter should've known better, yeah OP should be paid for the damage, holding the trip hostage is very close to blackmail imo and it's not cool behaviour if you want to actually maintain a decent personal relationship with someone despite an incident like this.", "He was apologetic.  Yes.  Fuck things, it could have been a valuable lesson for their kids but he decided to kick BIL when he was down.  Major Asshole.", "Mate, come on, do you really think op would give an unbiased view of this situation? Maybe they used 2nd trip as part of their reasoning but as their only reason? I decide not to believe that, just as you decide to believe the whole thing, everyone sucks here\u2026 apart from Ana, Lola and Charlotte", "Holy shit, she broke Sylvania familiees stuff, that's basically like setting real estate on fire, no wonder Luke is having a hissy about paying for it. Maybe this will be the push he needs to start parenting his child. NTA", "Definitely push for the money. If you cave on that, then Luke will think he can keep letting his child get away with malicious destruction because his family members are soft. Having to take a financial hit might be the kick in the pants that he needs to make sure Rue's issues are taken seriously, with more consistent therapy and other interventions.", "Is this another way of saying \"Not today, Satan?\"", "Yeah or tell him that you hope she has an understanding probation officer someday.", "This, children of divorce get seriously fucked up when they they've been abandoned.", "Where are you getting that she feels like an outsider because they aren\u2019t blood related? It sounds like she\u2019s behaving horribly at home where she\u2019s related by blood to her father and her sister.", "It's the audacity he had to even whinge about having to pay for me. I don't think I would have reacted favourably to that.\n\nOP is a saint for not clearing him out of the house for that.", "If a second trip is part of your reason means you have enough money for second trip and therefore money to pay", "There were two Sylvanian houses and a barbie dream house destroyed, those totalled around 650. It was the custom design stuff that was expensive.", "Yup, kiddo is expressing rage at her circumstances. Probably feels very ignored by mom and dad.", "It takes some nerve for a second holiday to be the reason, not being worried about rent or bills.", "You\u2019ve never gone and stayed at a friend\u2019s or relative\u2019s house for a weekend?", "Sorry, but she deserves it. Maybe she'll learn something for a change.", "\nMore importantly, the brother-in-law only apologizes, profusely, as long as it doesn\u2019t affect him financially. As soon as it has an effect \u201con the brother-in-law\u201d, all of a sudden, he pleads poverty I had to call bullshit on that one.", "Someone needs to sit down with her and say bluntly that nobody is going to be friends with someone who acts like that. I was a kid like Rue and it would've helped.", "Losing out on a summer vacation is a great opportunity for teaching Rue that whole actions-consequences thing. But they need to bring it up now while the behavior is front-of-mind.", "Exactly. Teaching kids how to apologize and how to forgive, and how to accept forgiveness is just like teaching manners. Repetition and practice until they learn how to do it on their own.", "Oh the urge I have haha. Not my place, and I wouldn't, but sometimes...I want to.\n\nI have this talk with Charlotte regularly. I always say \"daddy and I love you, we always will, no matter what you do. We love you beyond reason, but everyone else needs a reason, it's up to you to give them one\"."]}
