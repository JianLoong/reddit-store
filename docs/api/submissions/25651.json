She already feels bad. She *already helped for weeks before this*. She has been working every. Single. Day. This is her *one* day off. The mom has other people that she can call but she relies only on her two kids because it\u2019s too \u201cshameful\u201d? That\u2019s just wrong. You can\u2019t just force your kids to do stuff for you even when they\u2019re saying they\u2019re exhausted and you *agreed beforehand* that your daughter is so exhausted from working nonstop all week that she can have *one* day off after helping for weeks beforehand, then call her and rip that one day back. People need rest. She has other people she can call. She needs to swallow her pride and have those people help for one day. Her daughter is trying to do too much, already feels guilty when she\u2019s already worked herself exhausted, helped for weeks, and you\u2019re piling more guilt on. Burnout is inevitable at this rate and can cause a host of mental health issues.", "Thank you and everyone else for the supportive comments :) I will take a shower and a nap now, guilt free", "Is it possible that both Mom & daughter are just overwhelmed & exhausted? \n\nNo one is forcing anyone to do anything. Mom is disappointed not the end of the world. She already agreed to let OP have the day off. Maybe she\u2019s just freaking out. If OP wants to feel bad or guilty ... that\u2019s her choice. Just say no & do whatever she wants to do.\n\nIt\u2019s not Mom\u2019s fault that OP works in a horrible job. However... It\u2019s not that challenging to show up, help for a couple hours go home & go to bed. Once Mom is moved ... the job is done. It\u2019s not a never ending job.\n\nWhy do people not understand that\u2019s it\u2019s not possible to control other people\u2019s reactions. It\u2019s okay if people are disappointed. Just acknowledge that & move on. So Mom thinks she\u2019s selfish ... Mom will get over it. Probably not the first time they have disagreed on something.", "Because it's her freaking mom. It's not just anyone. And no, it won't affect her mental health, every new job is stressful and she'll get used to it in no time. I think some sacrifice is warranted when it comes to your mom.", "She already agreed to let OP have the day off\u2026.yet she called her over to help. And people keep missing that, she\u2019s literally been helping her for weeks already. Yes it\u2019s not the mom\u2019s fault that she\u2019s got a sucky new job that takes too much from her, but shouldn\u2019t the mom care about her kid\u2019s health and exhaustion? Not guilt her when she has *other people she can call*? No, she just calls her kid up to try and get her to help again, putting it all on her and her brother, when she already agreed to let her have a day off.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from, I really do. I quit a job to help my mom after a double hip replacement because that\u2019s what you do when your mom needs help. But one day, I had been helping for many days straight, and I was practically falling asleep next to her, I was so exhausted. You know what she told me? To go sleep for a few hours. That I needed rest. It goes both ways. Kids should help their parents, and parents *should know when their kids basic needs have to be taken care of*. Working your daughter into the ground is not being a good parent especially when she has *other people she can call*", "Yes it absolutely facking will affect her mental health. EVERYONE deserves a day off. And OP stated her mom had other people to ask for help she is just refusing. Instead she would rather put the burden on her exhausted daughter.\n\nNot having enough time to actually REST can literally drive a person crazy. Into anxiety, into depression. People were nevet meant to go go go go. Itd be one thing if she didnt work for the next 6 days.....you really need a reality check", "Ya cause she\u2019s 59 & has to move so she\u2019s probably freaking out! Seems very normal to me. Mom has to move. No options here. Have no clue what the time line is but it\u2019s gotta get done. Probably has a house full of her kids stuff & needs their help. (Mom of 4 adult kids here) \n\nAll OP has to do is call her brother & find out what exactly is going on. Why is Mom calling me? Do you actually need help or is Mom just flipping out?", "\u201cNo options here\u201d what? Did you not read the post? She has other people she can call. She doesn\u2019t because she\u2019s too prideful, she needs to get over that and stop putting literally everything on two people only, especially since she already told one of them they could have ONE day off after helping already for WEEKS", "If I was Mom I would just throw it all away. But for all anyone knows it\u2019s stuff that OP may want so she needs to be there. I have no clue what Mom wants... maybe it\u2019s come help or maybe it\u2019s come take your stuff out of my basement.\n\nIf this situation brings shame on Mom then why would anyone choose to put her through losing her home & being shamed for it? Why not try to be respectful & kind to the woman who raised you?\n\neta \u2014 I\u2019m not saying OP needs to go & help today btw", "Where\u2019s the respect and kindness for the daughter that already helped for weeks and is exhausted and overworked? Why does she get one day off that the mom agreed to and then has that ripped away? Getting your house foreclosed on isn\u2019t \u201cshameful\u201d. That\u2019s a disgusting, classist point of view. So everyone in the housing crisis of 2008 who got fucked over is \u201cshameful\u201d? The mom needs to reach out to the people in her life, other than her kids, for help.", "She has to be out by September 8th, so still a couple of weeks to go. I don\u2019t have any stuff in the house, so it is a \u2018come help\u2019 situation. I don\u2019t really understand what you mean by bringing shame on her? It is a difficult situation for anyone but I nor any of our family or friends have ever shamed her. The shame she feels is the situation itself, everyone around her is supporting her and trying to lift her spirit.", "I didn\u2019t say bring shame.... she already feels shame so it\u2019s just about acknowledging that. If she doesn\u2019t want to ask for anyone else\u2019s help .... then she\u2019s probably not going to. Even if she has other people that can help she only wants you & your brother to know what\u2019s going on with her situation. Sucks for everyone.", "Aah I see, I\u2019m sorry I misunderstood. Yeah it\u2019s a sucky situation for everyone, but obviously most of all for her. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine in the end though, just gotta get through it", "NTA\n\nIt was agreed upon and you have been doing her a FAVOR in helping her thus far.\n\nNext time, don't answer the phone/texts while on a \"day off\".\n\nIt really comes down to this is something SHE caused, so if she wants your help, it will be on your schedule.", "No you work six days a week get one day to yourself and have to do all the chores around your house if she can get help from someone else then she needs to she also needs to take her pride out of the situation and just deal with the fact that you have your own responsibility and it's not catering to her", "She was the one who decided she wanted to have kids. If someone has kids in order to use them as personal indentured servants,they shouldn't have kids at all."]}
