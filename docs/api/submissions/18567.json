There's the people that say they don't know better because \"the only have the brain of a child.\" Children are smart. I have worked with both children (daycare) and mentally disabled adults (group home care) and can say that their life experience definitely puts them above children too. An old coworker of mine was telling one of our clients that they wouldn't be able to take them to the store that day because the only other person working was training and couldn't be left alone with the clients. Later that day when our manager arrived, the client went to talk to her. He came back out later and gloated to my co-worker \"haha, I just got you in trouble.\" He apparently told our boss that my co-worker cussed him out and yelled at him when he asked if they could make the store trip. If it weren't for the trainee to back up what really happened, my co-worker would've gotten in trouble too. The fact that the client gloated about the lie before the trouble even came was enough to know that he knew what he was doing. There's a lot of misconception about what the mentally handicapped are capable of, and some of them know this and use it to their advantage (just like children would).\n\nIn short, NTA. You did nothing wrong. Even if you did come off harsh the second time, you had told him not to do it before and he didn't listen. What he considers mean is probably just you telling him what he didn't want to hear with possible embellishment to make you look like the bad guy. There is a chance he doesn't know right from wrong, but if that's the case, the company is in for a huge problem if/when he starts stealing.
