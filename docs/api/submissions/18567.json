Even if you had been more direct, it still would not have been rude. You shouldn't have been fired, but there are plenty of places where it's not illegal unfortunately.", "NTA, but you're well shut of the place.

The first time he did it you should have gotten a lock for your locker.  It was a really simple fix.  I work in a business office, but hide my valuables at work just because you never know who might come in as we are located in a busy foot traffic area and people without appointments just walk in (sometimes drunk or otherwise and we have had computers stolen out of the building during regular business hours although the building is in a really nice area).  It's your job to make sure your stuff is kept safe.  While I do think they overreacted and he could have misinterpreted it as harsh (it may have seemed harsh to him because no one corrects him), no matter where you work, you need to keep your stuff secure from everyone.  You really have no idea if someone else in the company ever went through your bag because you did not catch them in the act.  As someone who has to go through files on other people's desks to find the ones I need without making it look disturbed, it really is not that difficult.", "INFO: In you post you used the words \"mentally handicapped\", did you also use them while discussing this issue with colleagues or managers at work? \n\nI ask because, where I am from, this is a negative/derogatory term, just saying these words would get you fired.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NO PLACE is safe from theft.  If not co-workers, then customers can easily sneak in to the break room.  If there's not a lock on your locker, go to the store and get one in the future.  ALWAYS lock your stuff up.\n2. You should have immediately taken the situation to your supervisor when it happened the first time.  That's not \"tattling\", but making them aware of a situation that could potentially have adverse effects for the employer.\n3.

They might be more lenient because he is neurodivergent but the situation still needs to be addressed.

Most companies have policies on the steps before termination.
