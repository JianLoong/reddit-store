Apparently it has become quite a thing, relatively famous.\n\nI guess the boys got together and decided to do the same thing. High-quality printing and absolutely A+ photography, and came up with a really slick product. It is selling well on campus and at this point it's going to be on pretty much every girl's dorm wall (and some guys' walls as well LOL). They've made decent money -- to help fund the team but MOST donated to a children's cancer charity, pretty amazing.\n\nWe didn't know anything about this until Cole came home and proudly presented us with a copy (his month is May). It did not go well. His mother almost had an stroke. Wailing. Hyperventilating. Weeping. Apparently she is too \"mortified for words\" to comprehend that a bunch of college girls are going to have a picture of \"her baby\" in the buff on their walls for one month. And \"What will her friends think?\"\n\nI think it's ridiculous. A calendar of naked guys is nothing to get worked up over. They're all technically adults, and I'm proud of the boys' ingenuity and confidence. I'm sure it took some balls to do that (figuratively, not only literally). And to give the money to charity... amazing. I told my wife that she should lighten up, that if I looked as good as he did at that age and had been as handsome and tan and fit I would have done it too.\n\nThe calendar is NOT X-rated, and NOT porn. Ok it's pretty damn racy and definitely pushing the limits, but no one's \"business\" is really exposed thanks to judicious poses and props and such although they are definitely pushing that \"exposure\" to the absolute max. I have to admit if anything was shifted the tiniest bit you'd be able to tell the boys' religion, so to speak, but they kept it all legal enough...and they obviously WANT it to sell. Fine. Who cares.\n\nHis mom though is insisting that I \"do something about it.\" What am I supposed to do? What's done is done. \"Stop them!\" You can't stop what has already finished. \"Get them back!\" Seriously? You know that's impossible, right? \"Punish him!\" For what? How?\n\nCue more hysterics. And now she's not even speaking with me for not supporting her, and \"ashamed to show her face\" to her friends who I'm sure couldn't care less about some college boys' pictures from 600 miles away. And for what it's worth Cole's girlfriend is totally on board with it. My wife called me an asshole (but not in those words) but not taking her side.\n\nSo AITA. Perhaps I am the asshole for not seeing things from my wife's point of view and not sympathizing with her.\n\nBut I don't think I am.\n\nJUDGEMENT FAX I might be the asshole because (1) I didn't take into account my wife's distress and was dismissive of her and (2) as a good husband I should be more attuned to her feelings.", "created_utc": 1690864333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f26f1/aita_for_devastating_wife_over_sons_nude_calendar/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's fine to be uncomfortable with what your adult son did. the wailing/sobbing/dramatics, though, are counterproductive and annoying.", "Your son sounds wonderful. I'd be very proud of mine if he did the same thing (once he's a few years older of course). They came up with a great idea, saw it through to the end, and raised money for an important charity. An excellent practical lesson in entrepreneurship, product development and marketing.\n\nNTA and your wife needs to stop having hysterics and shaming Cole for this.\n\nIf she'd told you quietly that she was horrified and embarrassed, then you should have been supportive. But the screaming, crying, and demands that he should be punished - I have no sympathy whatsoever.", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty hilarious. No mom wants to think of their son as a sexual being, but he\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s covering his private bits, and, well, what\u2019s done is done. \n\nYour wife\u2019s reaction is over-the-top. Wailing? Hyperventilating? Seems like she hasn\u2019t realized that her baby boy is an adult now. She may be even more mortified to know her friends would love to get their hands on that calendar!", "NTA. She doesn't have to approve of the calendar. If she doesn't want to see the pictures, that's totally understandable. But insisting that you try to stop the calendar from being published and trying to get you to punish him is totally unreasonable and ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nSo here's the deal.... In order for your wife's friends to know about it, they'd have to buy said calendar. AKA: They wanted to see semi nude young men. What are they gonna do? Call her/text her and tell her she should be ashamed of him all while knowing they spent money on an item containing photos of semi nude men half their age? \n\nIt's like someone calling their friend and telling them that their daughter has an Only Friends page and passing judgement.... They only way you'd know is if YOU visited the site.... \n\nAs for your wife's feelings. She's welcome to her opinion and feelings. But she crosses the ah line the minute she even implies that you should automatically side with her simply because you're married. That's bullshit and it needs to stop. Just because you marry someone doesn't mean you're signing up to always agree with them and side with them on everything. There are going to be times where you're wrong or she's wrong. This is a perfect example. She's in the wrong and you would be too if you tried to stop the calendar for being sold or tried to \"punish\" your adult son.", "NTA. Show her that firefighters and other professionals in noble fields of work also participate in this kind of thing for charities etc. Her reaction seems way over the top, and she seems to be far too concerned about what others think of her.\nAlthough to be fair, her reaction would probably be considered as way more acceptable if this was her daughter rather than her son. There's probably a huge double standard here.", "NTA. There is literally nothing to be done. And attuned to what? Her hyperinflated sense of your son's purity? He is a college athlete on campus, with a girlfriend. She should be glad he didn't come home with a positive pregnancy test.", "NTA, that's a ridiculous reaction", "NTA. Sounds like it was tasteful nudes to me, she is overreacting.", "NTA - your wife is far too concerned about what everyone else will think. Chances are that anyone she knows will ever really hear about it. She should keep things in perspective, this was a great thing that benefitted charity.", "NTA. She might want to go talk with a therapist about this\u2026 it was an overreaction but she\u2019s clearly not doing well still.", "NTA. This is great. Your son sounds like a lot of fun. It\u2019s a calendar to raise money at his school, being sold to other college students, it\u2019s not like he made a sex-tape thats being broadcast on the national news.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to learn to see your son as his own person quickly or more drama is incoming", "NTA\n\nask your SO to get a grip, honestly. What is she? A posh housewife? She should laugh a little", "INFO: so where could someone buy this calendar? I'd need to see for myself and assess it before making a judgement ;)\n\nLOL, just kidding.

Tasteful nudity can show a lot more than your son has shown. Your wife sounds like she has some kind of modesty gospel you don't share. At the very least, you two need to understand each other. What is she truly worried about? Is what she fears likely to pass?", "NTA and your son should help deal with his mother\u2019s anxiety about what her friends will think by asking all her friends if they want to buy a copy of the calendar. Then she\u2019ll know! Problem solved.", "Can we see the calendar \ud83d\ude0a so we can tell ourselves of its really slick haha", "NTA your wife needs to get a grip on reality. Your son and his team sound amazing. Good for them.", "Nta. What abt your feelings, your take? Why is she not attuned w how you feel? Why does it even matter to her? Most ppl with a calendar are on campus.

He\u2019s a college student that participates in sports and was part of an effort to raise money for their team and sick children. He seems to be succeeding with all of that and also has a social life since he has a gf.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what he\u2019s not. He\u2019s not a criminal. He\u2019s not a drug addict. He doesn\u2019t seem to suffer from mental illness. He doesn\u2019t think only about himself or he wouldn\u2019t be helping to raise money for sick children. \n\nYour wife needs to be thankful for the son she has.

Just give her some space and encourage her to talk when she's ready to, provided it's not spouting the same rhetoric.", "NTA.  \n\nIs this an unusual level of anxiety for your wife? Could this issue be a lightning rod for other feeling she is having about her son moving away?", "NTA. However I guess you could technically buy all the calendars? Maybe they do bulk discounts :)", "NTA your wife needs a big glass of wine and to get over it.", "I guess it\u2019s ok for young adults to sell their bodies for profit.

Even popular youtuber Markiplier did a nude calander (not X-rated) for charity.", "Maybe your wife needs to learn about ethical sex work and how it's nothing to be ashamed of, I'm sorry she felt shocked but maybe some education will help ease her mind.\nI think it's pretty cool they did that and it's cool that you're supportive of him.\n\nNAH", "Yes and no...YTA for being dismissive of your wife, but everything you said is correct lol so...NTA?", "Finally, a light read on this sub!
