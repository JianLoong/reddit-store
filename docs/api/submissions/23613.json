Apparently it has become quite a thing, relatively famous.\n\nI guess the boys got together and decided to do the same thing. High-quality printing and absolutely A+ photography, and came up with a really slick product. It is selling well on campus and at this point it's going to be on pretty much every girl's dorm wall (and some guys' walls as well LOL). They've made decent money -- to help fund the team but MOST donated to a children's cancer charity, pretty amazing.\n\nWe didn't know anything about this until Cole came home and proudly presented us with a copy (his month is May). It did not go well. His mother almost had an stroke. Wailing. Hyperventilating. Weeping. Apparently she is too \"mortified for words\" to comprehend that a bunch of college girls are going to have a picture of \"her baby\" in the buff on their walls for one month. And \"What will her friends think?\"\n\nI think it's ridiculous. A calendar of naked guys is nothing to get worked up over. They're all technically adults, and I'm proud of the boys' ingenuity and confidence. I'm sure it took some balls to do that (figuratively, not only literally). And to give the money to charity... amazing. I told my wife that she should lighten up, that if I looked as good as he did at that age and had been as handsome and tan and fit I would have done it too.\n\nThe calendar is NOT X-rated, and NOT porn. Ok it's pretty damn racy and definitely pushing the limits, but no one's \"business\" is really exposed thanks to judicious poses and props and such although they are definitely pushing that \"exposure\" to the absolute max. I have to admit if anything was shifted the tiniest bit you'd be able to tell the boys' religion, so to speak, but they kept it all legal enough...and they obviously WANT it to sell. Fine. Who cares.\n\nHis mom though is insisting that I \"do something about it.\" What am I supposed to do? What's done is done. \"Stop them!\" You can't stop what has already finished. \"Get them back!\" Seriously? You know that's impossible, right? \"Punish him!\" For what? How?\n\nCue more hysterics. And now she's not even speaking with me for not supporting her, and \"ashamed to show her face\" to her friends who I'm sure couldn't care less about some college boys' pictures from 600 miles away. And for what it's worth Cole's girlfriend is totally on board with it. My wife called me an asshole (but not in those words) but not taking her side.\n\nSo AITA. Perhaps I am the asshole for not seeing things from my wife's point of view and not sympathizing with her.\n\nBut I don't think I am.\n\nJUDGEMENT FAX I might be the asshole because (1) I didn't take into account my wife's distress and was dismissive of her and (2) as a good husband I should be more attuned to her feelings.", "created_utc": 1690864333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f26f1/aita_for_devastating_wife_over_sons_nude_calendar/", "score": 4711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's fine to be uncomfortable with what your adult son did. the wailing/sobbing/dramatics, though, are counterproductive and annoying.", "Your son sounds wonderful. I'd be very proud of mine if he did the same thing (once he's a few years older of course). They came up with a great idea, saw it through to the end, and raised money for an important charity. An excellent practical lesson in entrepreneurship, product development and marketing.\n\nNTA and your wife needs to stop having hysterics and shaming Cole for this.\n\nIf she'd told you quietly that she was horrified and embarrassed, then you should have been supportive. But the screaming, crying, and demands that he should be punished - I have no sympathy whatsoever.", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty hilarious. No mom wants to think of their son as a sexual being, but he\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s covering his private bits, and, well, what\u2019s done is done. \n\nYour wife\u2019s reaction is over-the-top.

In order for your wife's friends to know about it, they'd have to buy said calendar. AKA: They wanted to see semi nude young men. What are they gonna do? Call her/text her and tell her she should be ashamed of him all while knowing they spent money on an item containing photos of semi nude men half their age? \n\nIt's like someone calling their friend and telling them that their daughter has an Only Friends page and passing judgement.... They only way you'd know is if YOU visited the site.... \n\nAs for your wife's feelings. She's welcome to her opinion and feelings. But she crosses the ah line the minute she even implies that you should automatically side with her simply because you're married. That's bullshit and it needs to stop. Just because you marry someone doesn't mean you're signing up to always agree with them and side with them on everything. There are going to be times where you're wrong or she's wrong.
