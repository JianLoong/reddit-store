Fair is fair, he really shouldn't be relying on your payout from a terrible accident as a source of income. Better to pretend that money doesn't exist altogether, so put it in a long-term deposit, or at least tell him that you did, and that there is no way to withdraw it without triggering a penalty. At the same time, taking two weeks off in a month, is it wasn't scheduled well in advance, does seem a bit excessive, I think you two need to sit down and try to figure out what is going on with his mental health.

You also have some anxiety around money that may be clouding your approach. Think about how you are approaching the topic with him. Are you coming to the table full of that fear and anxiety? Are you inadvertently chastising him for not doing enough? Are you coming to the table genuinely curious about his fears and well-being? He's been strong for you while you were suffering he may not currently have the skills to let you be strong for him while he is suffering.

Ask them to invest your money. Ideally you would end up with several different investments- some short term & some long term & some that allow you to access the cash easily in case of emergency. \nDoing this will get the money in a less accessible place, so it\u2019s not as tempting to spend it. Make sure you keep the account info well hidden, and don\u2019t talk about it even with your boyfriend.\n\nWhen you say the apartment is your own, does that mean you own it? If not, buy an apartment or a house - but in your name only. I know you love your boyfriend & want to be with him forever, but realistically you are both very young. If he walks away, he can easily get a job, but as you pointed out this money has to take care of you for 60-70 years. So keep everything in only your name - this is very important. The money needs to travel with you & take care of you. If you have a joint bank account please get a new one just for you at a different bank.\n\nFinally, I would just stop buying extras. Set a reasonable budget: food, clothing, phone & wIFI charges. Pay your bills, make sure you yourself buy enough healthy food & shampoo & TP to get through the week. Use a delivery service if you can\u2019t go to the store yourself. Then don\u2019t pay for anything else. If he wants extras, he can go to work. \u201cNope, we are out of money for this week\u201d.\n\nPS: Read up on money management. You are young to be in control of so much money. Start with an easy book or find podcasts or UTube videos about managing money.", "I am so sorry OP. It looks like he is planing to stay with you till all your money is spent. If he really cared about your needs, he wouldn't make you waste your money now instead of keeping it for emergencies. I am afraid you are only going to open your eyes and see the reality when it's too late. NTA, of course.", "NTA\n\nAfter reading all the comments in here all I have to say is you need to protect your money. It's yours, not his. Don't give him access to your account at all.

You guys haven't even been living together that long and already he's slipping into bad habits, which will lead to him being fired. What then? His thinking is that you have all this money to fall back on to support him. You need to make it abundantly clear to him that if he gets fired, he's on his own.", "Everyone deserves days off. And if he is bringing in the majority of the money, and paying for most of the finances, what obligation does he really have? You're only dating", "Yta. So what's the long term plan? Boyfriend continues to work while you dont? And you think you're entitled to save your money but have him work more hours to continue to pay more than you? Are you permanently disabled or temporary? He could just as well break up with you for being a burden. You can't get a remote or job that's accessible to you? \n\nAlso, you're only 18/19 and not married. If the money you got from insurance is worth more to you than your boyfriends mental health after he had to grind income nonstop while internally dealing with his girlfriends accident, then YTA. Also what do you do for him? You mentioned he made more than you and now he only makes slightly more than you... meaning he is still contributing more than you are.
