When we started dating, the Christmas Eve party was a joy and something we looked forward too every year.  As time went on and family members passed away, people got divorced, etc., the party became a lot smaller so my husband's aunt took over the festivities.  Every year, it's the same thing... a completely planned out party with timed activities.  It completely took all the fun out of the party.

If I invited friends to my home for a movie, and one friend decided to spend that time in the kitchen reading a book and eating ice cream, I'd feel a little uncomfortable about the situation. \n\nOr the other way around, if I invited friends over for a book club and one of them decided to spend the entire time watching a TV show on their phone.\n\nSister wants to have her family over to do games, and it looks like most of the family is happy enough to go along with this. It's okay to have scheduled events at a gathering.", ">(if it's not finger food, make it so)\n\nHehehe\n\nI love all of this in theory lol, but that last line has me snickering", "if your friend worked an 8 hour shift and drove 2 hours to get to your house why not let them just chill tf out? and this is family not friends, OP's parent's house. Generally speaking that would entitle him to as much use of the house as his sister.", "It seems like the point of the gathering is that it\u2019s Christmas so the family is together to celebrate Christmas. I don\u2019t think him not wanting to play a board game ruins that event at all. If this was specifically a game night, then yeah - you\u2019d be right.", "She's not even the host though.", "You read the part where this isn't the sister having people over right? It's the parents house. And that it's not having people over for game night, it's christmas?", "And it's also fine if he doesn't want to join the scheduled events because he had work all day, drove several hours, and didn't get to eat with everyone else. He's still there with family.", "I never watched any of the Star Treks after the original one, but I love that quote from Picard.", "Yes, well, one of the perils of living in NYC is that you have friends from all over and everybody has to travel two hours to get to your house. Especially my house, I'm on Staten Island. So I really would say that if they can't manage to be social then they shouldn't go to a social gathering.", "And if OP's parents were inclined to back them up on this, then that'd be one thing, but it sounds like they're not. If OP really, really, really can't do anything with the family when they get there, and Sister isn't willing to compromise at all on the choice of activity, then I think OP needs to follow the second part of my advice which is to leave and make it clear that this is going to be the way it is - they won't show up if they have to do a thing right away.", "And if Sister is not willing to compromise on this even a little then I said that OP ought to start leaving as soon as she starts bugging them about it.", "That's a bit rude. \n\nJust because OP's version of being social (catching up with family they haven't seen for a while) is different to his sister's version of being social (playing a new board game) doesn't mean he shouldn't attend Christmas at his parent's house at all.", "I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting that OP doesn\u2019t want to be social? It sounds like he\u2019s happy to plop and watch and chat, just doesn\u2019t have any brain power left to learn a new game. \n\nI\u2019m in Los Angeles, I get it. I\u2019d much rather have someone come and participate in their own way than force them to do things my way, or not even come.", "Why should OP leave christmas at his parents house which he drove hours to be at because his sister is being unreasonable? He should tell her to shut up", "Well. Let me put it this way.\n\nOP can't change anybody's behavior but their own. \n\nOP can't actually *force* Sister to stop pestering them, and OP can't actually make anybody else stand up to her and say \"Hey, leave your sibling alone\".\n\nBut if OP says \"I'm not going to put up with this, I'm going home\" and stands by that then I'm pretty sure that after one or two painful episodes Sister will get the message and stop bugging them over this. \n\nShould they have to do that? Yeah, maybe not. But if they take my advice then they will most likely only have to do it once or twice for it to stick, and then never again. Which seems a lot better to me than having arguments about it every holiday forever.", "Because if OP leaves his parents' house over this then Sister will *actually* shut up, now and forever more. \n\nIf OP simply says \"Shut up\" then things will continue as they have been, with an escalating argument every holiday.\n\nI like to do the thing that gets the results."]}
