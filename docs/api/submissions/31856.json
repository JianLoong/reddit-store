Merry Christmas everyone.\" Look at your sister.\"  No, I'm not ready to play any games. I'm not a grinch, I'm tired from working all day. I'm not an ass. You all have fun.  Where's the food?\"", "NTA... My husband grew up in a family that had these huge Christmas parties on Christmas Eve every year.  Food, gifts, conversation... he was one of the few kids in what was a predominately grown up party and he loved it and couldn't wait to be an adult at the party.  When we started dating, the Christmas Eve party was a joy and something we looked forward too every year.  As time went on and family members passed away, people got divorced, etc., the party became a lot smaller so my husband's aunt took over the festivities.  Every year, it's the same thing... a completely planned out party with timed activities.  It completely took all the fun out of the party.  She and her daughter insist on playing games every year with extremely complex rules that no one but them can follow.  They get angry when no one wants to play or have trouble figuring it out.  They \"win\" every hand in the game.  It's become such a drag, that when we moved out of state this year my husband said to me, \"at least we don't have to go to that god-awful Christmas Eve party this year.\"  \n\nI get it OP.  I just want to talk to people I haven't seen in a while, enjoy the food, company and a good laugh.  I could understand if everyone was into the game or it was specified a game night... like a family tradition of playing Monopoly on Christmas but if it's something you're not into, then you just aren't into it.", "NTA.  Time to ask her, before Christmas, what her actual issue is and why she has so much trouble understanding your situation.", "NTA, but maybe talk to your parents about *starting* with the game and eating when you get there? That way, you won't get shit for not playing. \n\nAlso, it's more than kind of rude that they *know* you have to work, how long you have to drive, and when you'll get there, and they insist on eating without you. They should adjust the time of dinner so that you can eat *with* your family.", "Nta after the first decline 'what part of No do you not understand? Stop harassing me  and go do your game'", "If you called her a Christmas Nazi, then yes, YTA\n\nComparing her to a regime that committed atrocities in its attempt at ethnical cleansing and caused so much pain and suffering throughout the world, is quite extreme.\n\nIf everyone else enjoys the games, just learn to accept this little back and forth you have is another Christmas tradition.\n\nOr... Why don't you take the day off, so you're not exhausted by the time you get there and don't need to decompress?\n\nOr... Speak to her before Christmas and tell her you'd appreciate it if she didn't keep badgering you to join in.", "ESH - Her for being overbearing about the game and you for being a grinch.", "Soft YTA. The tension with your sister is of your own making. You arrive late with a bad attitude and don\u2019t participate in the festivities. I can assure you that you aren\u2019t the only person who is tired/stressed, so that excuse can\u2019t be used year after year. You\u2019re an adult in a group setting for the holidays\u2026I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re expecting here.\n\nYou say your sister makes the day \u201clame with too much planning and pressure.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty rude thing to say when all you do is show up and eat. Family events require planning\u2026but you wouldn\u2019t know that because that effort is evidently beneath you. You\u2019re trying to paint your sister as wanting things her own way, but you\u2019re contributing nothing except your presence. Stop shitting on your sister\u2019s efforts to plan and include you.", "NTA - Talk to her now and explain it all again. Suggest that they start the game before you get there, so when you arrive you can grab a plate of food and decompress while they're having fun. This gives you the time you need and the game she wants without anyone being upset. Let her know this will make the evening more fun for everyone which is her goal.", "NTA - you aren't ruining anything. There's nothing wrong with you sitting on the side and being a part of the conversation while everyone else is playing. It would be different if you stayed in the living room or otherwise separated yourself from the group. At that point it would be like, why come? But if all you want to do is sit out the game, she needs to back off, and let you drink your cocktail and enjoy yourself.", "NTA, I would actively crack a beer in her face and tell her to \"calm down Buddy the Elf\" in the most passive-aggressive voice possible.", "It's not fun for you. Your participation is not required. But your sister has found a convenient way to punch your buttons and paint you in a bad light. \n\nWhy not try some deflection? \"Oh, no, we were playing that (whatever the game is) in the break room and I'm too experienced to play with newbies.

Your sister sounds like a brat", "NTA At all, just wanting to relax for a while after a long day and journey is perfectly acceptable.

Play UNO. It is simple, you can talk during it, and nobody gets uptight about it. Boardgames are too intense.", "NTA - You work over Christmas so I can understand you not having the mental capacity to play the games that your sister sets up.\n\nI think the sister is the a**hole because she applies emotional blackmail which is a form of abuse.", "Probably. You can't make an effort ONCE A YEAR?", "NTA\n\nshe's not the arbiter of holidays whose word is law on how to celebrate. you're not obligated to celebrate her way and she's not obligate to celebrate your way.\n\nonly one of you seems set on forcing the other to comply though.", "Of course.  \n\nAnd I should clarify, I am not flipping over the table or sighing loudly from the corner.  I hope everyone that wants to play, plays.  I simply haven't wanted to learn a new game after a full day - I'm usually the only person present who worked on the holiday.", "Yes.", "Why not before Christmas this year? The holiday season has barely started.\n\n\u201cHey Sis, I think it\u2019s great that you are always looking for new ways for our family to have fun together. That said, as you know when I roll in on X-mas eve, I\u2019m completely beat, so I would really like to avoid the drama around my being too tired to play. Can that be a Christmas gift from you this year, and every year after? [Optional to include: I\u2019d be much more up for playing a game on Christmas Day after presents and before we start cooking Christmas dinner. Why don\u2019t we move game time to then?

So no, it isn't comparable, since probably most people there have not worked that day, since it's a holiday on most jobs.\n\nHowever, you do have a point that berating on the sister for planning stuff and wanting to have a good time is not ok. Just as she shouldn't force him or calling him a grinch for not wanting to participate. It's not a game if you don't want to play, it's labour. Also, not everyone likes games, and that's ok.

His sister isn\u2019t playing the games alone. Granted, shift work during the holidays is exhausting. I\u2019m not minimizing. I\u2019m saying if every person used \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d as a justification, then even what he values about the holiday would be diminished. Ie, Im tired, so I\u2019m not cooking anything or I\u2019m tired, so I\u2019m not going to stop and pick up drinks on my way. Im tired, so I\u2019m not coming this year.
