When we started dating, the Christmas Eve party was a joy and something we looked forward too every year.

Generally speaking that would entitle him to as much use of the house as his sister.", "It seems like the point of the gathering is that it\u2019s Christmas so the family is together to celebrate Christmas. I don\u2019t think him not wanting to play a board game ruins that event at all. If this was specifically a game night, then yeah - you\u2019d be right.", "She's not even the host though.", "You read the part where this isn't the sister having people over right? It's the parents house. And that it's not having people over for game night, it's christmas?", "And it's also fine if he doesn't want to join the scheduled events because he had work all day, drove several hours, and didn't get to eat with everyone else. He's still there with family.", "I never watched any of the Star Treks after the original one, but I love that quote from Picard.", "Yes, well, one of the perils of living in NYC is that you have friends from all over and everybody has to travel two hours to get to your house. Especially my house, I'm on Staten Island. So I really would say that if they can't manage to be social then they shouldn't go to a social gathering.", "And if OP's parents were inclined to back them up on this, then that'd be one thing, but it sounds like they're not. If OP really, really, really can't do anything with the family when they get there, and Sister isn't willing to compromise at all on the choice of activity, then I think OP needs to follow the second part of my advice which is to leave and make it clear that this is going to be the way it is - they won't show up if they have to do a thing right away.", "And if Sister is not willing to compromise on this even a little then I said that OP ought to start leaving as soon as she starts bugging them about it.", "That's a bit rude. \n\nJust because OP's version of being social (catching up with family they haven't seen for a while) is different to his sister's version of being social (playing a new board game) doesn't mean he shouldn't attend Christmas at his parent's house at all.", "I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting that OP doesn\u2019t want to be social? It sounds like he\u2019s happy to plop and watch and chat, just doesn\u2019t have any brain power left to learn a new game. \n\nI\u2019m in Los Angeles, I get it. I\u2019d much rather have someone come and participate in their own way than force them to do things my way, or not even come.", "Why should OP leave christmas at his parents house which he drove hours to be at because his sister is being unreasonable? He should tell her to shut up", "Well. Let me put it this way.\n\nOP can't change anybody's behavior but their own. \n\nOP can't actually *force* Sister to stop pestering them, and OP can't actually make anybody else stand up to her and say \"Hey, leave your sibling alone\".\n\nBut if OP says \"I'm not going to put up with this, I'm going home\" and stands by that then I'm pretty sure that after one or two painful episodes Sister will get the message and stop bugging them over this. \n\nShould they have to do that? Yeah, maybe not. But if they take my advice then they will most likely only have to do it once or twice for it to stick, and then never again. Which seems a lot better to me than having arguments about it every holiday forever.", "Because if OP leaves his parents' house over this then Sister will *actually* shut up, now and forever more. \n\nIf OP simply says \"Shut up\" then things will continue as they have been, with an escalating argument every holiday.\n\nI like to do the thing that gets the results.", "No, NTA. Just tell her ahead of time that you won't be available to play, so why not start the game before you arrive. She gets to host her game and you get to relax.", "YTA for trivializing the term Nazi. Please don\u2019t. Unless your sister suddenly advocates wiping out members of other religious, ethnic, and racial groups on Christmas, she\u2019s not a Nazi.\n\nNTA for being beyond frustrated with her though. You have every right to want nothing to do with her games.", "NTA for not having energy to play games but you're a bit of an AH for how you talk about your sister bringing board games. Big board game family here. It's not just for kids. And it's also totally fine for her to start a new tradition and bring something she likes to the holidays. It doesn't have to be something you grew up with to be important or an ongoing thing. She shouldn't be complaining and pressuring you to play but she clearly wants you to spend time with her and that's kinda cool. A lot of adult siblings grow apart and don't even speak and she's still being a typical little sister who wants her big brother to hang out with her. Don't feel forced to play or put up with her glaring but maybe be happy your family cares.", "\"Hey (sister's name) wanted to get ahead this year by calling you. I'm planning on working the Xmas shift at work and will be arriving late. I don't want to play any reindeer games. I know I'll be tired like every year. I'm sorry, and I still want to see you.\"\n\nNTA, but if the money isn't important, it might be nice to arrive earlier in the day to eat with the family instead of heating up what's left. I'm sure your family (sister) is upset she doesn't get to see you all the time. No one remembers your work, but everyone remembers your absence.", "NTA", "NTA\nBut for your relationship\u2019s sake, I would head this off at the pass with your sister and ALL the relatives you interact with before the event. Some kind of text like, \u201cMerry christmas! Excited to hang out, I have a lot of work during holidays and it is always nice to decompress and chat with you at the family gathering. Can\u2019t wait. See you soon!\u201d And a more explicit and direct version to your sister who clearly doesn\u2019t understand you yet. Key word yet. Minor TA to extended family for not jumping in and armbaring you or sis out of the argument and ho ho ho ingly handing you a beer when you walk in. This could be super minor if people are proactive.", "NTA. Tell her ahead of time this year that you're not going to play and that you're not going to argue about it. Then when she asks, just say, \"I already told you, I'm not going to play, and I'm not going to argue about it.\" Whatever she says back, just keep repeating, \"I'm not going to play, and I'm not going to argue about it.\" Eventually, she'll get bored and stop asking.", "I mean you guys are just different obviously, both are kind of being ridiculous, board games are fun, I always try to get my family to play something because I honestly can't sit and just catch up, my anxiety and depression just don't really let that happen.  So you acting like she is forcing some new weird ritual on your family is a little ridiculous, but she also shouldn't be a dick about you not wanting to play.", "I wanna see that christmas show, the Christmas nazi !", "NAH I see both sides and I feel there is room for a compromise. It is totally stressful driving after working all day to show up hungry and tired and trying to decompress after a work day to be immediately bombarded with learning a new game. \n\nYour family should start any games before you arrive (if you\u2019re that late I mean). And maybe once you\u2019ve had a chance to decompress you might feel more inclined to join in on a game. If not, you can still be there and present and enjoy the company. I don\u2019t get the feeling you\u2019re sulking if you don\u2019t play or participate. Moreover, there are also games that a group of people can play that don\u2019t involve 100% of the players\u2019 attention the entire game. That would give the whole family time to hang out and chat while still playing the game. \n\nSounds like you have a loving family with just a disconnect on some areas and a sister that just wants you to play and be involved because she enjoys your company. I agree you talk to your sister beforehand. Hope you have a happy holiday!", "I think the basic interaction that you have is working--the sister is being annoyingly perky and demanding, the brother (OP) is tired from a day and also obvious about finding the sister annoying, and I see that everyone else is amused.\n\nBut the OP's irritation is deeper.  Notice some things through the piece:\n\n* Sister plans activities in a care home for a living (out of the public eye)\n* \"Totally not mandatory\" is in quotes to emphasize that while she SAYS that, she's actually enforcing her own Christmas vision on everyone else (underscored by calling him a grinch for not participating)\n* OP makes a point that this was NOT the family tradition... and ends with \"...which she invented 3-4 years ago.\"\n* OP makes another point that there are no children or teenagers present\n* OP explicitly says that not only is she failing to take into account that he's been at work but sister makes the day \"lame with too much planning and pressure.\"\n\nOP doesn't just want permission to sit out the game.  He'd like to stop the board games, even if he isn't openly admitting it.\n\nThe time to do this is NOW, of course, not on Dec. 25.\n\nWhen my uncle got married, he married a woman who is sporty and active, not one inclined to sit around like the rest of us.  Our family traditions bored her, and she tried to get folks to get up, play cornhole or badminton, or even just walk around.  She met with limited success; my uncle and their kids joined her and the rest of us remained slugs.  We mostly just wanted to sit around, eat, talk, play board or card games, and maybe watch a movie or ballgame.  Some folks are just wired differently.  She wasn't right or wrong, and neither were we.\n\nThe real question is how the rest of your family feels about Ms. Camp Counselor instituting board games.  If they welcomed it, you're SOL.  If they're quietly resentful like you are, you might have some luck rallying the troops to throw off your very own Nurse Ratched Christmas fascist.", "This. \u2b06\ufe0f And have the conversation sometime before the actual day.", "My cousin did the same thing. We used to all just hang out and do board games/chat/play and now it\u2019s scheduled games. \n\nI stopped going to family Christmas because of it.", "I f'ing hate jigsaw puzzles so much. My mother loved them and used to try to make me participate, and I hated it so much! I simply wouldn't go to a family gathering if they were mandatory.", "But she knows OP doesn't want to play. OP never wants to play. OP is not going to suddenly change. It's like saying, \"We saved you some of your least favorite food,\" and then being pissed when someone doesn't want to eat it.", "He has told her that. Repeatedly.", "Doesn't matter. No means no.", "But it revolves around the sister?", "Sister can't make an effort ONCE A YEAR to not bother OP?", "He has explained to her why he doesn\u2019t want to participate. She has responded by calling him an ass. And it isn\u2019t her gathering. It\u2019s his parents\u2019 house and an annual family holiday gathering.

After years of saying no, I would have had words.", "Bandwith is my new favorite word", "Festivity fascist", "I'm not saying it's the paragon of logic. I'm just saying that with the holidays, there's always this pressure to make the perfect home and the perfect family and the effect holiday, etc. Sometimes people get so caught up in fulfilling these expectations, they lose the forest for the trees. Basically, she needs to cut it out but I can still empathize with her even though she's wrong", "As in, play before he gets there", "Having a bad time like by playing insipid board games?", "This was my thought. Tell sister to do the board game prior to OP getting there.", "The compromise is that people who want to play a game play a game, and people who don't want to don't. I don't like games. Never have, never will. Unless I'm responsible for babysitting a little kid, or I'm getting paid to play (not just gambling on the game for money, but a guaranteed hourly wage for my time playing), I'm not doing it. The compromise is that I won't gripe or tease or bully anyone about  everyone else interrupting a perfectly good conversation to play Settlers of the Lost Ark or whatever the heck they're doing, if they won't try to make me play.", "That\u2019s a good one.\n\nOP, you are NTA.
