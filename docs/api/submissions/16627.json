They have a habit of saying inappropriate things to the female servers. I\u2019ve never seen it happening but, given the clientele we appeal to it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. They also get very drunk which makes them 10x rowdier and more likely to say vulgar things and make more charged \u201cjokes\u201d. \n\nAs a result of this no one wants to serve them. They have asked our manager to kick them out and she refuses to because they spend a shit ton of money. Their next solution was to have me do it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to do that because I\u2019m just as scared as they are. I\u2019m 5\u20197 140 pounds.

You could argue I\u2019m in more danger than they are. \n\nI refused, my manager didn\u2019t want to hear me talking about how I was uncomfortable serving them so I said that if I go serve they\u2019ll probably be less likely to buy as much as they don\u2019t have any eye candy to flash a lot of money at to try to impress.

You could have stayed firm and told the boss no that they need to do something about the impending lawsuit or mass quitting that's bound to happen because they are being sexually harassed.\n\nYou all could have banded together and forced your boss to do something.

Serving customers IS in fact your job too.\n\nThere is no reason whatsoever to assume that the group of sexist pigs harassing the women is going to harass you, and even less justification for claiming that they are going to \"take it out on you.\"  The logical thing to do would be to unite with the women and push harder on the manager to give these guys the boot.

And the team reasoning makes sense they wouldn't say vulgar things to you.\n\nSo I'm not going to say your the AH for being irrationally scared, I'll let the women judge you on that but you definitely should consider serving them, that's your job. Why do you think they'd be violent towards you?\n\nEdit: I glossed over it but yeah YTA for using the boss greed to avoid the situation. Fear can't justify everything, and using money to justify harassing is an AH thing to do.", "ESH maybe or NTA.. I say that because your boss is a definite AH. She is putting $ above her workers' comfort. You may be because you knew how uncomfortable multiple workers were feeling, and you didn't even try! You could have gone over there and started serving.

Sorry guys, but here to keep the drinks flowing!\" If they responded badly, then go and speak to your boss and refuse as well. What is she going to do, fire you all? If that was your mother, sister, etc, being treated disgustingly in front of you, would you keep quiet?

Expecting a young person to understand collective bargaining and be able to immediately stand up to their boss, risking their livelihood, while uniting with the other servers is a bit idealistic.  The female servers also did not think to unite with him, they didn't consider his physical safety.  In hindsight they should have all refused and left their manager to get her hands dirty.  None of these young people should be in such a vulnerable and uncomfortable position.  Hooters and that specific, and those patrons are the assholes here.", "ESH. You. Your manager.

He\u2019s one of the strongest people I know, both in actual physical strength and strength of character. Since YTA, let me tell you how someone of character and similar size to you would have handled belligerent drunkards harassing his women coworkers in his vicinity. He would have very politely insisted that they be escorted out. Failing in that endeavor, he would have served them himself. Willingly. To make sure that the women they are making unsafe are safe because he knows that they are the target and he is a good man and he would do that for anyone in any circumstance no matter who or where they are at the time. At least try to show a little solidarity next time, okay?", "YTA.. I'm your size and I'd have no problems doing it. They might even leave and never come back.. golden opportunity missed. At worst you cop some school yard insults.

On behalf of women everywhere thank you!!!\n\nDude has NO CLUE what we are subjected to every single time we exit our front door and venture out into a world populated by a population of thoughtless and entitled humans who feel like women are there for their amusement, entertainment and conversation! We do not owe a hello to a strange man who greets us, we do not owe them our phone number if they ask for it, and we do not owe them a smile or a thankyou or a nipple flash if they wolf whistle...although there are STILL a lot of them that believe that \"boys will be boys\" and \"you're attractive, you should EXPECT this behavior...\" no, NO,  and aw hell NOPE!", "This is wrong. He just did not allow them to throw him under the bus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe handled that well.", "[deleted]", "\"Which is something the girls I'm 100% sure didn't get to say no to before trying. \" .. because it was THEIR job, not his. \n\nHE was only even asked because they tried to say no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd he refused - just like them - so the job fell back to them.", "They would not.

It absolutely does. \ud83d\udcaf \n\nThat said, if I hear someone say something inappropriate to one of my employees (of any gender!) I will step in and take over the situation. As a manager the well being of your staff should be the first concern in this situation.\n\nMy vote would be NAH, except for the manager. Manager is big AH and should step up for her (?) staff. Don't let the girls continually be harassed, don't put your only male server in the line of fire, deal with the situation yourself if their money is so important. Or kick them out.\n\nFor everyone voting Y T A, he stated he was just as scared of the table, and because he's a man, he's just expected to put himself at risk? Hard disagree. Honestly, he would probably be in more danger. These boys (I will not refer to them as men), would treat OP worse because he is the only male. He's also at a higher risk to experience physical assault from this table, I've seen drunks start fights for the silliest reasons.", "The manager is to blame for allowing patrons to act like that.

He's serving drinks and maybe food.\n\nAs an old woman who once upon a time worked in bars and dealt with that kind of crap far too much, I can say that the majority of drunk and obnoxious men who would harass the female staff did NOT do the same with the male staff.  They would usually just ignore them, place their orders, and continue to ogle the female staff from afar. And yeah, sometimes they'd try to ask the male staff about the female staff.
