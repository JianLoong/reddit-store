They have a habit of saying inappropriate things to the female servers. I\u2019ve never seen it happening but, given the clientele we appeal to it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. They also get very drunk which makes them 10x rowdier and more likely to say vulgar things and make more charged \u201cjokes\u201d. \n\nAs a result of this no one wants to serve them. They have asked our manager to kick them out and she refuses to because they spend a shit ton of money. Their next solution was to have me do it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to do that because I\u2019m just as scared as they are. I\u2019m 5\u20197 140 pounds.

Even then, they may be mad that they didn\u2019t get a chick server and may take it out on me. You could argue I\u2019m in more danger than they are. \n\nI refused, my manager didn\u2019t want to hear me talking about how I was uncomfortable serving them so I said that if I go serve they\u2019ll probably be less likely to buy as much as they don\u2019t have any eye candy to flash a lot of money at to try to impress.

You could have stayed firm and told the boss no that they need to do something about the impending lawsuit or mass quitting that's bound to happen because they are being sexually harassed.\n\nYou all could have banded together and forced your boss to do something.

Serving customers IS in fact your job too.\n\nThere is no reason whatsoever to assume that the group of sexist pigs harassing the women is going to harass you, and even less justification for claiming that they are going to \"take it out on you.\"  The logical thing to do would be to unite with the women and push harder on the manager to give these guys the boot.

And the team reasoning makes sense they wouldn't say vulgar things to you.\n\nSo I'm not going to say your the AH for being irrationally scared, I'll let the women judge you on that but you definitely should consider serving them, that's your job. Why do you think they'd be violent towards you?\n\nEdit: I glossed over it but yeah YTA for using the boss greed to avoid the situation. Fear can't justify everything, and using money to justify harassing is an AH thing to do.", "ESH maybe or NTA.. I say that because your boss is a definite AH. She is putting $ above her workers' comfort. You may be because you knew how uncomfortable multiple workers were feeling, and you didn't even try! You could have gone over there and started serving.

Why should he risk his well being?!  \n\n\nWe both know why you think why and we both know that it is sexist.", "I don\u2019t think you realize that guys are in much more danger with other guys of things getting violent, though women are much more highly likely to get harassed. So yes, it is less likely the man gets harassed, but if things escalate, it\u2019s more likely these men resort to violence with another man, especially a petite gay man.", "Who\u2019s 5\u20197 140 lol", "And his solution is to have them serve them, not kick them out :)", "I am almost with you in the ESH camp, but the female waitstaff shouldn\u2019t have to threaten to walk off to be treated with respect. Economic security is hard to come by these days. If the wait staff had a union that was refusing to budge overall, I might agree with you. Pretty sure a union would have those guys out on their asses though.", "\"What are you talking about?\nThe manager and the female staff aren\u2019t friendly like that. The manager is fine with their staff being sexually harassed. You sound like an autistic incel.\"\n\nDid you just use \"autistic\" as an insult?", "Whoa. Way to be ableist there, bro.", "Oh good, so he has no problems for recommending the girls do it. Because obviously the manager has the final decision not him, right?", "That they dont give a shit if you're a petite gay man. that has no relevancy to this situation, you're a coward is what hes saying.", "I mean it's not your job to stand in your co workers place. I nor anyone should judge you for the decisions you make as a gay man who is vulnerable as much as women are.", "Fair enough. But if we're talking about this specific incidence. The female coworkers were experiencing sexual harassment, men who sexually harass women don't typically sexually harass men. \n\nHaving worked in places like that, you would get your male bar staff to take over drinks orders from the perves. And the female bar staff would do it for the males if they had someone harassing them.", "Becasue until recently sexual harassment was just considered, \u201cthe way things are\u201d \u201cboys being boys\u201d etc etc. \n\nSo it\u2019s not considered violence. And not factored into these conversations typically. \n\nAlso worth pointing out, violence against women is rarely ever treated as a hate crime despite even in cases where the perpetrators background clearly shows he\u2019s misogynistic. We don\u2019t treat systemwide sexual violence, murdering of pregnant women or women trying to flee abuse or rejecting male advances as hate crimes even though they clearly could be.", "He could back them up rather than shirking away any responsibility. Even if the manager had made the same decision, if he had backed up his colleagues this would be an entirely different post. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.", "Hush that wouldn't fit the narrative he's pushing", "Then the response shouldn't be to send an uncomfortable guy over to do it they should prioritize their employees. Don't make the wrong person the enemy when it should be the managers and owners prioritizing profit over people.\n\nEdit; and yes his fear of the guys gettong pissed and being worse to him is pretty valid in my eyes as I've seen it happen, I've first hand seen a male server get knocked out cold because he said I'm going to be your server the rest of the night sir to which the guy responded with the fuck you are and sucker punched him.", "absolutely, they're pissed a dude didn't bend the knee to be used and disposed.", "They can get physically aggressive. They are drunk. You never know. I agree that he should not send female co workers. But he doesnt have to go either. Also defending his co workers or fighting for them isnt his job. They can talk to manager themselves about the situation.", "THe same is true for the girls, isn't it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey were asked first.", "NO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey wanted to refuse to serve them as long as THEY had to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs soon as they had pointed a thim, there was no solidarity with HIM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo he deflectedf back at those AHs, and did the same thing to them that they did to him - just better.", "why then not blame the woman who denied them a safe work environment. the fact you're all deflecting blame to the only dude who actually refused to being put in danger by his greedy manager reveals that you know exactly how biased and sexist your gaslighting is. you see men as disposable and held no woman accountable.", "\u201cAdvertised their goods as bait\u201d my dude that\u2019s literally the entire fucking point of a hooters type establishment.", "Okay. He is the AH for the comments and how he got out of it. Also, yes, he could have pushed more to get the table banned, but do you think one additional voice would've changed his managers mind? After multiple of the girls protested serving the table the manager should have dealt with it and it shouldn't have gotten to the point it did. \n\nSo ESH. \n\nManager and table the most AH.\n\nOP for the cowardly and sexist remarks against his female co-workers.\n\nFemale staff for trying to feed him to the wolves because he's a man, in turn also sexist. \n\nOP and girls should get together and report manager to HR. The wait staff is a team and they don't have each other's backs like a team should. Which is a direct reflection of their manager.", "Then stop with the stupid speculation...", "  He's a gay petite man. He may have had trauma from assault before for being who he is. I don't think any of us has a right to judge someone when we don't live that life.", "he's the asshole for one comment- you could argue im in more danger than they are! \n\nno you're fucking not OP.", "bc the women are being harassed for their gender? so remove that gender part and OP is left", "The manager is the AH but OPs explanation of how the eye candy would bring in more money is just as scummy and misogynist as the clientele", "Their first solution was to kick them out.

But in all seriousness, this is what happens when men listen to all that redpill and homosocialty nonsense, they stop seeing women as people who need solidarity and just think about \"how this will affect me\", rather than how can we all deal with this together.", "Nope, not buying it.\n\nAnd yes, I agree with you that management should prioritize their employees in a perfect world.  But it's not a perfect world, and ultimately he is the one who stuck the women in a situation that is far riskier to them than the situation he would have been in.", "He made himself the enemy when he chose to throw his female coworkers under the bus, He literally admits that he \u201cput [his] female coworkers in harms way to protect [himself]\u201d.

The manager put them in that situation knowing they were doing that and knowing the male server did not want to do it. With what authority did he make anyone do anything? I don't even get the I convinced my manager to do it because nah that's letting the person with actual authority off the hook. I've kicked people out, called the cops on them, stopped their tabs for sexualizing staff, if you are a manager you prioritize your people every day of the week because no one else is going to.\n\nEdit; ultimately the person with the authority to make the decision put them in harms way, the manager has the final say in this not the employee.", "Did they not throw him under the bus?
