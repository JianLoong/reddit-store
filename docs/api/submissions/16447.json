{"id": 16447, "submission_id": "138jllc", "title": "AITA for calling out my SIL on her coping mechanism?", "selftext": "For background, my husband and I have an 18 month old. My sister in law (SIL) and her husband have a 3 year old autistic son. My SIL is pregnant with baby #2 and has been struggling a lot with processing her sons diagnoses that she received over a year ago. Her new coping mechanism is telling her mom, sister, and My husband that they ALL have autism and she does too. She says this is where her sons autism came from. Now prior to this, nobody in th3 family was diagnosed. She's done her own research and is adamant they all have autism. Since my daughter is around that family often, I told my husband she can't say that as it will create a self fulfilling prophecy for my daughter and shape her views on herself. If you grow up around someone constantly telling you that your whole family has autism, you will belive it affects you too. My husband told his SIL I was upset about it and now the family thinks I'm the asshole. But I think I'm doing the right things for my daughter. Side note - NOTHING is wrong with autism! Just concerned about wrong diagnoses on my SIL part. So, AITA? Additional side note - I know she can't 'CATCH' autism, but when everyone you're surrounded by tells you they have it and you might too, it does shape how you view yourself. That's what I mean by self fulfilling prophecy. Additional edit - her family calls it her coping mechanism, as they belive they are not autistic. My SIL's husband has autism on his side though but they say theres no way it came from his side.", "created_utc": 1683288178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138jllc/aita_for_calling_out_my_sil_on_her_coping/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The SIL is stupid and should shut the hell up about everyone else. This isn\u2019t a coping mechanism. It\u2019s insane. She did her own research? I bet she thinks everyone got it from vaccines too. You need to either put her in her place immediately or cut contact. There is nothing wrong with being autistic but you don\u2019t go around self diagnosing it to other people. I feel sorry for her new kid.", "ESH. Your SIL shouldn\u2019t be armchair diagnosing everyone, but the idea that your kids is going to \u201ccatch\u201d autism by hearing about it is really dumb.", "NTA, I think people responding to you are getting lost in the weeds thinking you are saying something you aren\u2019t.  If you sub out autism for any other condition/diagnosis/trait, your concern would be the same.  If you tell a kid that she\u2019s pretty but not smart, smart but not athletic, athletic but not kind, whatever - they internalize messages and confirmation biases can be seen if someone (SIL) is motivated enough to look for them.  \n\nI get your concern, I would have it, too.  Protect your kid and tune out the other people.  Your mom instincts are right on this one and who cares if people are mad at you about it.  That\u2019s not your problem, your daughter is your priority.", "Info: do u think your child will get autism or do you think your child will believe they have it as they get older", "Late in life diagnosed autistic here. \nESH.\nFirst of all, it's extraordinarily common for adults to learn about their own neurodivergence through their children being diagnosed. A LOT of us older folks slipped through the cracks in our own childhoods.\nSo your SIL may be onto something. \nBut regardless, it's not appropriate to go around telling people they are autistic or have ADHD or what have you. Talk about it, query it, sure. But not diagnose.\nFor that reason, she sucks.\nYou suck too, OP, for your weird fear that autism can be a self fulfilling prophecy.\nThis is not how brains work. I imagine that, if anything, it may increase daughter's awareness of diversity and disability to learn about autism.\n\nAlso, a note on language- many (not all, I'm sure) autistics prefer autistic person, not person with autism. This is because autism is so central to one's experience in the world  they can't be separated.\nExample: We say a person with cancer, not a cancerous person, because the cancer isn't a defining aspect of their personality, and they had a life separate to it before the cancer. But it's the opposite with autism.", "NTA. Your daughter is not going to be harmed by what your SIL says if she is not your daughter's daily caretaker over the next few years. Your SIL is stressed. She will not likely persist in this very long. Keep your mouth shut.", "ESH.  Armchair diagnoses by untrained folks aimed at others are typically worth about as much as their nonexistent medical degrees. (Self-diagnoses are unfortunately a common start towards getting a proper diagnosis with some conditions; I\u2019ve got a mix of rare and relatively common medical issues, and more than one of my conditions, you often only get diagnosed if you suspect it enough yourself to insist on being seen by a high level specialist in that condition). So your SIL running around diagnosing everyone is obnoxious and not useful; at most, she might have a point if she was suggesting other family members get properly evaluated if they share noteworthy traits of the condition.\n\nBut your suggestion of a \u201ccreating self-fulfilling prophecy\u201d for your daughter is equally absurd and obnoxious.  That\u2019s not how autism works.  It\u2019s like worrying she\u2019ll catch a genetic disorder because some of the family have it - she\u2019s either already got it or she can\u2019t get it.", "Not a full ESH, but a mishmash of ignorance and self-importance.\n\nFirst, how often are these conversations happening, particularly around children and others?  Sounds like something discussed once or twice and then done.\n\nSecond, your sister has no business running around telling people they have autism or \"accusing\" them of being the gene provider.  This is both morally incorrect and factually incorrect (or at least misguided) in a lot of ways.\n\nThird, you are a also juggling misinformation.  You can't \"learn\" autism.  More importantly, at 18, 24, or even 36 months - a child isn't going to understand what's going on and decide \"oh I'm autistic\".  \n\n Give the situation space.  If your child gets to be 2, 3, etc. and every day is an autism party of dread and arguments at your inlaws, have an adult conversation that you don't want it to be a constant focus on it.  As your child gets older and actually comprehends language, begin talking to them about these things.  That's what parents do.", "That's the power of the Internet! With Google, one can talk themselves into anything!", "YTA, that's not how autism works. It's not a self fulfilling prophecy, you can't manifest it. Your SIL is clearly looking more into it due to her child's diagnosis and has obviously seen autistic traits in the people around her, it's not uncommon and it could be entirely possible that people have had undiagnosed autism in the family.", "ESH 'self fulfilling prophecy' isn't fair so if your daughter was to get diagnosed what you'd blame it on your SIL and nephew or what, also autism is more often than not genetic, it wouldn't be left field for your family to possibly have some autistic traits however armchair diagnosing isn't  a good thing to do", "Esh.\n\nYou can acknowledge that some people display autistic traits, but you can't diagnose them with it.", "YTA\n\nAutism is highly genetic. It's not a \"coping mechanism\", she's learned about the symptoms when her son was diagnosed and now she sees the behaviors for what they are. It's very common for people to only be diagnosed as an adult after a child in the family was. Not having a diagnosis does not mean someone isn't autistic.\n\nYour daughter isn't going to believe she's autistic just because she's around autistic family members. That's a strange fear to have.", "EDIT: ESH. You can't catch autism but she's ridiculous for saying that everyone is autistic.", "NTA  ... Need to tell SIL that while men can be on the spectrum, it's passed thru the female genetic line....I don't have the link for the study I saw but I'm sure it's available online somewhere. \n\nSecondly autism is a spectrum. Every single living human being is on the spectrum somewhere. For most it's the 0.5 level with asymptomatic presentation. Her son simply was high enough in the spectrum to warrant diagnosis from his symptoms. \n\nShe had zero merit to diagnose people and her constant insistence IS detrimental for developing self image, minds, and behaviors.", "Do YoUr OwN rEsEaRch!!!", "NTA. Autism is wildly overdiagnosed and used as an excuse for crap behavior. So many people, especially on Reddit diagnosed themselves and their kids with Autism and ADD and it's infuriating. I agree with you completely.", "NTA - it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t think that your child is gonna \u201ccatch\u201d autism from her aunt and family.. and I agree completely - the mind is a funny thing and hearing the same thing over and over again can definitely leave an impression/mark.\n\nI have a super close friend that is convinced that herself and her 7 year old are autistic (spoiler alert they are not - assessment came back that her son isn\u2019t autistic and she still believes he has to be - every other adult in his life including his K and grade 1 teacher don\u2019t think he is either)\u2026 but her belief is slowly ruining her marriage and friendships. \n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t self-diagnose for a reason. There is nothing wrong with autism - my husband is (doctor diagnosed) autistic.", "YTA. Self diagnosis are valid, autism is genetic, and please tell me real quick why it would be a bad thing for your daughter to \u201cgrow up being told her family have autism\u201d I\u2019ll wait.\n\n\nOh also for calling your sister educating herself about her sons condition and realizing the symptoms make a lot of sense for her and her family In retrospect, a \u201ccoping mechanism.\u201d Please explain why her son existing in his current form is causing so much trauma she must continuously externalize in order to cope?", "NTA.\n\nIf only her son has been diagnosed then he's the only one with Autism. She has no right or qualifications to be laying diagnoses on the family. Anyone with basic biology knows you children are formed from genetic material from both sides of the family. Unless it was an \"immaculate conception\" the autism problem can't be all from her family, it's a product of both. just because the kid has it doesn't mean everyone has it and I would have no patience for this \"coping mechanism\" unless she has a proper diagnosis.", "NTA!  Every family has lore. Sometimes musical ability, creativity, nervousness, timidity, and so on and so forth, is said to run in the family. Children are highly influenced by that. You're not saying that autism is a contagious disease, just that you do not want your daughter to be influenced by your SIL's lore.", "I agree that if she hears it over & over again she'll believe it.  Or if she hears the SIL talking about the others having it, she may worry that she may have it too.  Your SIL is the AH for diagnosing everyone without a medical degree.", "YTA! Is your 18mo old daughter spending soooooooo much time over there that she is going to learn something? Your mom instincts are pointing you at ignorance. Your kid spends most the day there, everyday, right? Tell me that\u2019s why you are being ridiculous. \n\nYou outta consider learning how to be a buffer for the things your daughter is going to be exposed to. Wait until she finds out the world thinks she needs a perfect body \u2026\u2026 you gonna buffer that at home with some strong safety rails ???? or are you going to \u201cprotect\u201d her and put her in a bubble where no one can have access to her to say such things\u2026.. because that message is on tv, in print, on billboards, repeated by boys & girls & people everywhere\u2026\u2026\n\nBetter use of your time is to buffer her with common sense and not fly off the rails like your SIL.", "ESH She's wrong for going around diagnosing people but you are just as wrong for thinking you can self fulfill your way into autism. That makes about as much sense as what she's doing right now.", "Thank you for sharing. This is EXACTLY what I'm trying to prevent. I'm sorry you had to go through this.", "Thank you for this feedback!", "Love this. Thanks for the feedback!", "Not an idea she will 'catch autism' but worried that when you're told something over and over as a young and impressionable child you belive it.  That's what I meant.", "> the idea that your kids is going to \u201ccatch\u201d autism by hearing about it is really dumb.\n\nTell that to all the TikTok Tourette's parents", "Thank you for this!", "I don't think she has it but I don't want people around her telling her she has it without any signs or symptoms.", "That's good information to know, thank you for sharing your experience. I don't think she can catch it, but also understand it's not as influential to hear as I might be worried about. I will refer to the autistic person as such moving forward. Thanks!", "OP meant as: her daughter may not have it, but after being told for years she has it, she will think she has it (without diagnosis).\n\nThe self-fulfilling prophecy was a terrible way to word it.", "I don't read it as the SIL \"accusing\" anyone, and if she is she would be accusing herself, since she's the kid's mom. \n\nTo me it sounds like she's gone through the symptoms because of her son's diagnosis and had an aha moment when she realized that she checked the boxes too, as well as her siblings and mother. It's very common for an undiagnosed adult to have such a revelation when their kid is diagnosed with the same genetic condition. Suddenly you understand all the weird things about yourself, the reason you felt so different and rejected. And that revelation is often huge and eye opening, you reevaluate your whole life. So it's pretty natural to want to share it with others especially if you think they might be affected too. It's their choice after that to get assessed or not, but I hope they check in with a doctor. That woman didn't armchair diagnose after a random tumblr post, she was involved with her kid's diagnosis. And when you have an autistic kid you actually have a pretty high chance of being autistic yourself.", "I wouldn't blame it on anyone, not at all.", "Agreed", "That everyone is autistic.", "Thank you for this! I agree it's detrimental and will research the article now!", "Exactly. I am.", "Thank you, I agree 100%!", "This is it!!! 100% my point. Thank you for explaining it accurately!!!!", "Everything is fine nowadays. After a while, this whole situation gave me the strength to react and I insisted on unmasking the many stories that my classmate told the whole school. He asked for a transfer the following week. Thank God I never heard from him again.", "Nobody is telling your daugter she has autism. SIL is telling her siblings and mother, not your kid. Do you really think SIL would go tell your baby she's autistic even if se thought so, rather than speaking about it with you or her brother?\n\nHowever autism \\*is\\* highly genetic. Statistically, having an autistic cousin means your daughter is twice as likely to be autistic than a child who has no family members diagnosed with ASD. I think deep down that's what is really worrying you. I think what SIL is saying stresses you out because you understand that if there is a genetic predisposition to autism in the family like she thinks, then your daughter is, in fact, at risk.\n\nInstead of being defensive I encourage you to read more about autism and consider if your husband should get a proper evaluation to be sure.", "You need to do whatever it takes to protect your child from whatever you think is harmful.", "You're nta. I think some people have jumped the gun and think you're scared your daughter will get autism due to her saying she has it. \n\nYoung kids are very impressionable and when you are told something enough times you can believe its true.", "Everyone in the family or everyone on earth?", "That's good information and a good suggestion. It just comes from a point of worry and I want to make sure I help my daughter if true. Thanks for the feedback!", "Agreed, thank you for the feedback!", "Exactly. This is exactly it! I know she can't catch it, but I don't want her getting told something about herself that's not proven to be true. Thanks for clarifying!", "Everyone in the family.", "I understand your concerns, however, regarding how your child deals with what she hears and how she deals with what's around her is on you right now as her parent. You can't protect her from everything, but you can teach and guide her to make up her own mind. \n\nYou sister in law shouldn't be telling everyone they have autism nor should they be placating her but it is genetic and no issue with highlighting that. I'd image she's trying to deal with alot of information and trying to learn how best to help her child so it would be a kindness to give her some time or even help.", "No problem I was really confused with all the comments saying u thought she'd catch it", "A friend of mine with two autistic kids is very open about the fact that she sees autism everywhere. She said its like when you only have a hammer everything looks like a nai.\n\nYou aren't wrong for proactively not wanting her to diagnosis your kiddo.

It\u2019s not impossible that it runs in your husband\u2019s family.", "Good advice. Thank you!", "Not impossible, and maybe more background was needed here.  Autism runs in her husband's family and she refuses to admit that's where it came from, but her side could have contributed as well. Either way her kid is still a great one."]}
