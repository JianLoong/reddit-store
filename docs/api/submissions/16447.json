My sister in law (SIL) and her husband have a 3 year old autistic son. My SIL is pregnant with baby #2 and has been struggling a lot with processing her sons diagnoses that she received over a year ago. Her new coping mechanism is telling her mom, sister, and My husband that they ALL have autism and she does too. She says this is where her sons autism came from. Now prior to this, nobody in th3 family was diagnosed. She's done her own research and is adamant they all have autism. Since my daughter is around that family often, I told my husband she can't say that as it will create a self fulfilling prophecy for my daughter and shape her views on herself. If you grow up around someone constantly telling you that your whole family has autism, you will belive it affects you too. My husband told his SIL I was upset about it and now the family thinks I'm the asshole. But I think I'm doing the right things for my daughter. Side note - NOTHING is wrong with autism! Just concerned about wrong diagnoses on my SIL part. So, AITA? Additional side note - I know she can't 'CATCH' autism, but when everyone you're surrounded by tells you they have it and you might too, it does shape how you view yourself. That's what I mean by self fulfilling prophecy. Additional edit - her family calls it her coping mechanism, as they belive they are not autistic. My SIL's husband has autism on his side though but they say theres no way it came from his side.", "created_utc": 1683288178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138jllc/aita_for_calling_out_my_sil_on_her_coping/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A LOT of us older folks slipped through the cracks in our own childhoods.\nSo your SIL may be onto something. \nBut regardless, it's not appropriate to go around telling people they are autistic or have ADHD or what have you. Talk about it, query it, sure. But not diagnose.\nFor that reason, she sucks.\nYou suck too, OP, for your weird fear that autism can be a self fulfilling prophecy.\nThis is not how brains work. I imagine that, if anything, it may increase daughter's awareness of diversity and disability to learn about autism.\n\nAlso, a note on language- many (not all, I'm sure) autistics prefer autistic person, not person with autism. This is because autism is so central to one's experience in the world  they can't be separated.\nExample: We say a person with cancer, not a cancerous person, because the cancer isn't a defining aspect of their personality, and they had a life separate to it before the cancer.

More importantly, at 18, 24, or even 36 months - a child isn't going to understand what's going on and decide \"oh I'm autistic\".  \n\n Give the situation space.  If your child gets to be 2, 3, etc. and every day is an autism party of dread and arguments at your inlaws, have an adult conversation that you don't want it to be a constant focus on it.

It's very common for an undiagnosed adult to have such a revelation when their kid is diagnosed with the same genetic condition. Suddenly you understand all the weird things about yourself, the reason you felt so different and rejected. And that revelation is often huge and eye opening, you reevaluate your whole life. So it's pretty natural to want to share it with others especially if you think they might be affected too. It's their choice after that to get assessed or not, but I hope they check in with a doctor.

For example, if a patient bangs on the desk during school and says \"It's my coping skill,\" we still tell them to stop and use another one because it's disrupting class.\n\nAnd I don't know why people are judgemental against the OP. She knows that autism isn't contagious. She just doesn't want her daughter to think that she might be autistic because an adult is telling her that an age where she is the most impressionable.", "NTA reddit hasn't heard the phrase diagnosis is a self fulfilling prophecy before and it shows", "NTA she\u2019s delusional and doesn\u2019t need a coping mechanism- she needs fucking therapy.  You are absolutely correct If a kid hears something enough they tend to believe it about themselves.   No difference if she called your kid stupid or ugly waxh time.  At some point the family needs to stop enabling this bullshit.  Especially since autism is present on the dad\u2019s side but she\u2019s in fucking denial about that part.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is trying to normalize her daughter by trying to label everyone else the same as her, which is...unstable. \n\nShe needs a stern talking to about her lack of qualifications and how her behavior actually erases real autistic people.", "You sound ridiculous AF here. ESH/YTA.", "> NTA, I think people responding to you are getting lost in the weeds thinking you are saying something you aren\u2019t.\n\nJust to be clear, the premise of OP's fears are founded in ableism and misinformation; it's a dangerous and ignorant precedent and does need to be called out. \n\nI agree with the ESH votes and feel this is an opportunity for a teachable moment. It's important for OP to hear from the ASD/Disabled community how their views impact those around them and that their child will be looking at them as well, not just their SIL.", "You should type social contagion into you Google bar.", "Not just this but as someone with autism I DESPISE people like the SIL. It dismisses people with autism and makes it seem like it's no big deal when actually it can have debilitating effects on life\n\nI really really hate people who do this because it's regressive and detrimental to the progress of society starting to accept neuro divergency and being more accessible to ND people\n\nSorry.... Strong feelings about this selfish \"coping mechanism\"", "Seems like sil and the rest of her family did.", "I understand you feel that way.  But your opinion and stating it affirmatively does not make it fact.  OP does not want someone to self diagnose family members and create a narrative around her child that could impact such child.  SIL has an emotional  motivation and bias and is not a medical professional. The underlying label could beanything - simply because it\u2019s autism does not make the problematic behavior that can hurt OP\u2019s child ableism.", "Okay but Tourette\u2019s isn\u2019t autism?", "Same situation here and I share the mad feelings, the sil needs to stop that right now", "And one of our counters to that is you shouldn't need to remind yourself we are human. \n\nLike autism isn't inherently dehumanizing so it's weird you would feel the need to actively humanize someone simply because they are autistic.", "People use person-first language to be PC, but many in the disabled community have pride in their diagnosis as it forms much of their identity and the ableist discrimination they face (though this can differ regionally and based on the individual's preferences). \n\nUsing person-first language intends to be helpful, but it can minimise those experiences and encourages people to see the disability as a \"negative\" when it's neutral, and we need to change the discussion around living with a condition/diagnosis. [Here's a good example of how to discuss disability for all ages](https://youtu.be/K7CL-1sgQGM)", "Autism isn't alone in having a lot of people who are self-proclaimed \"allies\" going around making declarations based on their own views. Be wary of stuff like this if it's coming from someone who isn't a part of the affected community.", "You would do well to understand that autism in girls is underdiagnosed because the signs and symptoms of autism in girls are generally just how girls are taught to behave as children.", "I would also suggest reading \"Don't Mourn for Us\" by Jim Sinclair (and maybe suggest passing it on to everyone else in your family). Jay Edidin talked about it being rhetorical root of the autistic advocacy movement. Link: https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/SinclairDontMournForUs.pdf \n\nSometimes parents of autistic children get weird. While insisting everyone in the family must be autistic is not helpful, at least your SIL hasn't gone down the rabbit hole of trying to \"cure\" your nephew.", "Oh yes the heck you can. There are studies about this very thing.\n\nHowever, I think the issue is that this happens when someone has a person constantly dripping the information into the ear of the child *and* having control of the child, ala derpy-_-dragon above. I do not think having this adult say to other adults and then not have anything to do with the raising of OPs child will cause the issues that OP is worried about.\n\nBut OP isn't wrong to pay attention and be wary. But learning more about how this sort of thing happens and then taking steps to say, never let the aunt have the kid alone for any length of time, will buffer any possible issues.", "Some people do believe disorders into existence. They're called psychosomatic conditions.", "it's not about Tourette's being the same as autism, it's the *trend* \\- the above commenter was most likely discussing the trend going around social media (TikTok in particular) where you have a whole echo chamber of people talking about X and Y about Tourette's or DID or whatever else and then deciding they *also* have it and having that self-diagnosis reinforced through the echo chamber.", "Ah that's a really good point and was never my intention but I recognize now how big that insinuation is with those words. It was one of my autistic friends who said it and I don't want to step on her toes saying something I know makes her uncomfortable but if it happens to come up again I think I'll say exactly what you did.\n\nThank you for your comment!", "Thank you so much for the added context! I'm not gonna make assumptions but that really struck me and knowing this person I wouldn't be surprised if there's some internalized stuff (one parent doesn't think autism is real). I never considered how that would impact the way she feels about the language used and I feel so silly for not checking in with someone else I know before running with this. I'm hoping the most important thing is that I don't use terms in front of or in reference to people when it makes them uncomfortable \ud83e\udd1e", "Definitely! I was told by a friend with autism but tbh I didn't think about the way her own struggles with how that plays a role in her identity influenced the language she prefers. Lesson learned for sure and I'll highlight how well another comment put it \"autism isn't inherently dehumanizing so it's weird you would feel the need to actively humanize someone simply because they are autistic.\"", "I see all your valid points. But she 18 months deep breaths hopefully by the time she old enough to realize things SIL will have come to terms and settled down", "Don't agree with that person. They made a rather bad generalization."]}
