My sister in law (SIL) and her husband have a 3 year old autistic son. My SIL is pregnant with baby #2 and has been struggling a lot with processing her sons diagnoses that she received over a year ago. Her new coping mechanism is telling her mom, sister, and My husband that they ALL have autism and she does too. She says this is where her sons autism came from. Now prior to this, nobody in th3 family was diagnosed. She's done her own research and is adamant they all have autism. Since my daughter is around that family often, I told my husband she can't say that as it will create a self fulfilling prophecy for my daughter and shape her views on herself. If you grow up around someone constantly telling you that your whole family has autism, you will belive it affects you too. My husband told his SIL I was upset about it and now the family thinks I'm the asshole. But I think I'm doing the right things for my daughter. Side note - NOTHING is wrong with autism! Just concerned about wrong diagnoses on my SIL part. So, AITA? Additional side note - I know she can't 'CATCH' autism, but when everyone you're surrounded by tells you they have it and you might too, it does shape how you view yourself. That's what I mean by self fulfilling prophecy. Additional edit - her family calls it her coping mechanism, as they belive they are not autistic. My SIL's husband has autism on his side though but they say theres no way it came from his side.", "created_utc": 1683288178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138jllc/aita_for_calling_out_my_sil_on_her_coping/", "score": 451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you sub out autism for any other condition/diagnosis/trait, your concern would be the same.

A LOT of us older folks slipped through the cracks in our own childhoods.\nSo your SIL may be onto something. \nBut regardless, it's not appropriate to go around telling people they are autistic or have ADHD or what have you. Talk about it, query it, sure. But not diagnose.\nFor that reason, she sucks.\nYou suck too, OP, for your weird fear that autism can be a self fulfilling prophecy.\nThis is not how brains work. I imagine that, if anything, it may increase daughter's awareness of diversity and disability to learn about autism.\n\nAlso, a note on language- many (not all, I'm sure) autistics prefer autistic person, not person with autism. This is because autism is so central to one's experience in the world  they can't be separated.\nExample: We say a person with cancer, not a cancerous person, because the cancer isn't a defining aspect of their personality, and they had a life separate to it before the cancer.

Armchair diagnoses by untrained folks aimed at others are typically worth about as much as their nonexistent medical degrees.

More importantly, at 18, 24, or even 36 months - a child isn't going to understand what's going on and decide \"oh I'm autistic\".  \n\n Give the situation space.  If your child gets to be 2, 3, etc. and every day is an autism party of dread and arguments at your inlaws, have an adult conversation that you don't want it to be a constant focus on it.

It's very common for an undiagnosed adult to have such a revelation when their kid is diagnosed with the same genetic condition. Suddenly you understand all the weird things about yourself, the reason you felt so different and rejected. And that revelation is often huge and eye opening, you reevaluate your whole life. So it's pretty natural to want to share it with others especially if you think they might be affected too. It's their choice after that to get assessed or not, but I hope they check in with a doctor.

The diagnosis was changed by a psychiatrist soon after they were being seen at our clinic. The new diagnosis was not as sexy, but was a better fit.\n\nPeople sometimes become their diagnosis.

Adult assessment for autism is often slow, difficult and sometimes also expensive (where I live you gotta get on a waiting list and wait a minimum of \\*two years\\* to speak to a specialist. The assessment itself takes months and involves calling your parents to ask them hundreds of questions about how you played when you were 3 years old as well as tracking down your old elementary school report cards, on top of all the quality time with doctors) (I have autistic friends who went through it). \n\nWhat SIL is doing is actually where a lot of late-diagnosed ND adults start their journey. \"Look at the symptoms! This is 100% me! It's also a 100% you! This is us! What do we do about that?\". That's how I got my ADHD diagnosis. My kid got diagnosed, and I looked at all the info I subsequently received about ADHD and told my husband: \"Welp, check, check, check, that's me. Also my dad and my little sister. I have ADHD too, crap. It explains so much, but oh crap\" Was I medically qualified to say that? No, but I was also right. And I'd hardly have bothered getting on the waiting list for endless tests with a psychiatrist if I wasn't 95% convinced there was something.\n\nNow, years later, I do have the official paper that says \"yes this woman has ADHD\", but I didn't get there right away.

In both cases, these are parents who are upset that their kid isn't meeting their standards of normal and what they expected. Your SIL is trying to expand the definition of autism so her kid fits this new definition of normal instead of accepting some people are neurodivergent and it's fine to not be neurotypical.\n\nThis bit from Sinclair's piece resonates with your description of your SIL:\n\n> What it comes down to is that you expected something that was tremendously important to you, and you looked forward to it with great joy and excitement, and maybe for a while you thought you actually had it-- and then, perhaps gradually, perhaps abruptly, you had to recognize that the thing you looked forward to hasn't happened. It isn't going to happen. No matter how many other, normal children you have, nothing will change the fact that this time, the child you waited and hoped and planned and dreamed for didn't arrive. [...]\n>\n> You didn't lose a child to autism. You lost a child because the child you waited for never came into existence. That isn't the fault of the autistic child who does exist, and it shouldn't be our burden. We need and deserve families who can see us and value us for ourselves, not families whose vision of us is obscured by the ghosts of children who never lived. Grieve if you must, for your own lost dreams. But don't mourn for us. We are alive. We are real. And we're here waiting for you.\n> \n> This is what I think autism societies should be about: not mourning for what never was, but exploration of what is. We need you. We need your help and your understanding. Your world is not very open to us, and we won't make it without your strong support. Yes, there is tragedy that comes with autism: not because of what we are, but because of the things that happen to us. Be sad about that, if you want to be sad about something. Better than being sad about it, though, get mad about it--and then do something about it. The tragedy is not that we're here, but that your world has no place for us to be. How can it be otherwise, as long as our own parents are still grieving over having brought us into the world?\n\nIf your SIL truly felt she was autistic (and was seeking formal testing, and was reaching out to adult autistic support groups on being an autistic parent, etc), that would be one thing as women often go undiagnosed as children and many only get diagnosed after their children are.
