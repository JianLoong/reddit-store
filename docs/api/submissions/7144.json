Without giving too much away, we work with vulnerable and low income clients in our community and link them to resources. Its an intensive job that requires us to meet with them at their homes.\n\nShe is really sweet and nice, and obviously comes from means. She drives a nice car and wears nice clothes. I accompanied her on a visit and she brought a large tote bag with the words \u201cCHRISTIAN DIOR\u201d embroidered in large letters. I suggested she leave it in the car, and told her its not appropriate to carry such a bag when visiting the home of a disadvantaged client who has trouble making ends meet.\n\nShe left it in the car but things seemed a bit awkward afterwards. I was talking with another coworker and they think that I overstepped my bounds. They think the bag is work appropriate. I think its bad taste to flaunt such a bag considering our client population.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: I warned a new coworker not to being her flashy designer bag with her to meet with an impoverished client.\n\nEDIT: I am not her supervisor but I was assigned to help train her and have her shadow me. \n\nEDIT: This bag https://www.dior.com/en_ca/fashion/products/M1296ZRGO_M928_TU-medium-dior-book-tote?&loopcd=COg%7Cm%7Cg%7CM1296ZRGO_M928_TU%7C139290931419&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_P6dBhD1ARIsAAGI7HBwfaEplP6VoH656NxqV0huGp57-eVkcNHkBoWwICkYqsdZCCENSCcaAsYgEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds", "created_utc": 1673537007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a27g4/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_that_she_should_not/", "score": 1502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are more diplomatic ways to word it maybe but the reason and sentiment are sound. Being in a trainer position it's also appropriate for you to bring up. Please do reiterate it with a supervisor. \n\nI work in a more medical capacity in low income areas, and if anyone thinks you're some rich ah slumming it for warm and fuzzy feelings they'll shut right down and let everyone else in the neighborhood know too.", "As someone who works with very low income individuals and goes into their homes, I would say NTA. It shows poor situational awareness and honestly I\u2019d be embarrassed to be holding a three thousand dollar purse while one of my clients cries because they can\u2019t afford food to feed their children without standing in line at a food bank. Also, we are advised never to take personal items into homes with us because of the fear of being robbed or worse. She should lock it in her fancy car\u2019s trunk before she even gets to the destination. \n\nI don\u2019t know the population of the people you serve, but I work with low income mothers and they certainly would notice and feel some type of way about it. We are even encouraged not to dress too nice in order to not make our clients feel intimidated. I think it\u2019s just poor taste to do what she\u2019s doing.", "NTA it\u2019s really hard not to resent being helped financially/socially already, and walking in with a bag that could feed a family for a month would definitely have made me cry when I was that broke. You need the rapport of your clients so they can ask for the help they need. \n\n It possibly depends how you told her but I suspect she was just experiencing culture shock because she\u2019s from the kind of background where a bag like that is a normal thing to own.", "NTA \n\nThat bag costs what I paid for my house on a low-income homebuying program.  I don't have any need for workers to come to my home, but if I did and one came with a bag like that, I would not at all be comfortable with them.  I would not trust them to even care about my case, let alone do anything to help me.", "All these y t a answers feel like they're coming from people who have zero experience in social services. You are absolutely NTA. If your colleague wants to continue in this field, this is an important lesson for her to learn early. \n\nThere's really just a time and a place to show off your wealth. bringing a $4k handbag into a client meeting with someone who's struggling to pay rent and keep food on the table ain't it.", "NTA I\u2019m studying in a similar field and try to have my work clothes be pretty neutral so that the client will hopefully never have to wonder certain things about me or compare themselves to me. As her trainer it was appropriate for you to mention it to her. These are delicate issues but your main concern should be for the clients.", "NTA she is obviously clueless. This will make her clients resent her and possibly even put herself in danger carrying a 4k bag.", "NTA.\n\nAbsolutely not. Listen I have a lot of designer bags, I collect them. I wear them a lot. I would be very understanding if I can\u2019t bring them to work. I work in media so it\u2019s not weird, and other colleagues also wear designer, but I once had an interview for a job at a union and I knew I had to dress differently. I used to leave my car at home for certain job interviews because it\u2019s weird if you drive a more expensive car than your \u201cboss\u201d.\n\nI think it\u2019s very good you told her and a little weird she didn\u2019t realize this herself.", "NTA - my bestie is a woman with $$$ and she's a director of social services here, I sent her this and she said she would have done the exact same as you did, and if this young woman had insisted on continuing to wear & take designer things around her clients she'd get sensitivity training and possibly fired depending on whether or not she learned to be more mindful and compassionate.\n\nBeing clean, comfortably & neatly dressed is fine. Flaunting your wealth to disadvantaged clients is cruel and just creates an additional divide which can make the work harder than it already is. It's hard enough for disadvantaged folk to even ask for help, but for someone obviously significantly wealthier to show up is just a slap in the face. It isn't aspirational, it's mean.\n\nShe can save her designer dressing up & accessorizing for when she's not working. I'm shocked at your coworker's opinion as well.", " NTA. Especially if you\u2019re her trainer", "Wow, seeing a lot of Y T A s already.\n\nNTA. Very clearly.\n\nThis work involves relationship-building, and in relationship-building, perception matters. Casually walking around with a bag that could be traded for a used car says \"I am not even pretending I know what it's like to walk in your shoes.\" People want to be understood, not patronized or \"rescued.\" And, yes, it's common for those in poverty to distrust the wealthy (whether or not you agree with it is irrelevant to whether or not a person working in a field like this should be aware of it and be prepared for it).  Saying \"poor people know that rich people exist\" is meaningless.  I'm aware that assholes exist, that doesn't mean I want to see yours.\n\nCommenting on a coworker's choice of accessory brought to a meeting is not the same as commenting on a coworker's attire or appearance.\n\nYou don't need to be somebody's supervisor to give them advice as a new employee. And even though OP did not explicitly state this, they were obviously accompanying the new employee on their visit to help show her the ropes.", "NTA\n\nThat particular bag is quite flashy and says the designer name in big letters across it. It\u2019s not going to make people happy seeing that.", "NTA: there are so many things that we have to learn at the workplace that are \"unspoken\". If your tones were kind and from a place of care, then absolutely NTA. This is part of what onboarding and mentoring is all about. Good for you for possibly going out of your comfort zone and giving her this tacit \"dress code\" protip. While NAH, your coworkers, if they care about welcoming this new employee and helping her transition, giving her advice in a gentle nudging way would've been nice.", "NTA. Talk about not reading the room.  If she that oblivious to things like this she might want to find another career.  Nothing says I want to help like carry a bag worth more than they make.", "NTA You have warned her once. If it causes her a problem, on her own head be it. But I wouldn't have left it in the car. Good way to get a window broken out.", "NTA, if I\u2019m being trained by someone and they told me it\u2019s probably not a good idea to present myself a certain way to our clients, I would take that as advice to do well at my job.", "NTA. I work with homeless, vulnerable adults and I\u2019d do the same. It\u2019s inappropriate IMO, plus clients will find it way harder to relate to her and build a trusting relationship if she\u2019s walking around dressed up in fancy designer gear and very obviously comes from a different background than them.", "NTA\n\nThis request shows empathy and compassion for the client.", "NTA. I do home visits with a similar population and new coworkers learn very quickly that we dress down to minimize the power dynamic. We also once had a relative shame a client asking why they couldn't look like the worker, so that was a big turning point and warning. I wear plain long sleeve shirts, jeans with no holes, closed toed shoes, and my hair up in a bun. Usually no makeup and definitely no jewelry, even my wedding band. I have clients that struggle to get out of bed or get dressed to see me, why would I risk potentially making them feel bad and hurt the relationship by dressing up?", "NTA. It\u2019s not wrong to have nice things. It is tone deaf when it comes to that level and the job at hand and consciously or unconsciously can affect her ability to make connections with clients.\n\nAdditionally, I had a sibling who did this type of critical work. It was challenging and very frustrating, so many people who were trying so hard and the help available was woefully inadequate. My sibling had to go into houses and apartments where living conditions were far from ideal. They were trained to bring nothing inside that could bring any insects and so forth back out. Your coworker would likely be upset to have bedbugs or roaches hitch a ride out.", "NTA! As a SOCIAL worker, SOCIAL awareness is important, meaning be relatable n approachable. You know social queues to be presentable to the public n wearing $4000 hand bags fake or nah in front of financially strained people is not okay.", "NTA. A lot of designer-brand merchandise is plainly **about** flaunting one's access to wealth, and no one could argue that the bag you linked is not trying to do that. It's a walking billboard for Christian Dior, and barely even a \"design\" outside of that.", "NTA\n\nObviously no one is saying that she shouldn't be allowed to spend her money however she sees fit but circumstances dictate how the help she is trying to offer may be interpretated.\n\nIf she is to go in there with it emblazoned across the front when the client she is helping is in dire enough need to require help in the first place, then morally speaking, it would be a little questionable and I'm sure would get some people wondering if she is even really there to help them at all.\n\nYou say she is really sweet and nice -  you're right, she might not be perceived that way if she had taken her bag in with her.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure what people are going for when they say ESH or YTA because you\u2019re just trying to help HER not look like an asshole.", "I really don't understand this people saying Y-T-A, this bag is more than 4k, If some of the clients research It imagine the humiliation of having someone with a bag that costs more than a month of their income, people already finds hard to need help from strangers imagine being shoved in their faces with a completelly out of this world priced bag, probably the sum of the bag, car and everything this woman have during the visitation worths more than a year income of thoses people, you had empathy and sensability, doesn't let this people make you feel bad NTA", "NTA\n\nIt is very tone deaf and I would have also pointed it out. \n\nThe people you visit are struggling to survive and need a friendly ear as much as they need the service you provide. Someone turning up head to toe in designer wear is not someone they'll be able to build a rapport with.", "NTA. I used to work as a social worker. I absolutely had clients comment on other caseworkers and \u201cshowing up in her 300 shoes telling me what to do\u201d. It\u2019s off putting to clients and keeps you from developing a rapport.", "NTA and i wonder about your co workers. Sounds like there needs to be a meeting to go over what is and is not appropriate. Edit: i just looked that bag up. NO ONE should be carrying that in a job environment unless it is a in large office building and you are in the C Suite.", "NTA.   It can also make her a target.    And yes, as a trainer, you can let her know what is appropriate for your job.   It could be considered flaunting", "NTA, she needs to be more aware of her surroundings. This bag is not appropriate for this line of work. The people you're helping probably already feel bad and seeing someone flaunt what's literally beyond their means could make them feel worse. And I understand that she shouldn't feel responsible for their feelings but in this line of work it's all about empathy. Especially since you guys are entering their space.", "I'm really impressed by the people here that are of the impression that if you aren't a supervisor of someone you have absolutely no right to give suggestions to someone. Suggestions are not any kind of orders. \nI don't talk about impressions it could leave, cause I don't  care about that stuff as long as she does great work, but your absolutely NTA for just suggesting that she should leave it in her car, it's not unreasonable or to personal, it's not an order or brought up in a disrespectful way. It's a 4k bag, it doesn't matter if she got it gifted or if it's fake.", "NTA this is one of the first things we were taught working in non-profit. Heck we had work phones and we were taught to hide our personal phones so it didn\u2019t look like we were rich having two phones. \n\nIt\u2019s about your surroundings, about connecting with the clients, and just acknowledging thar if you\u2019re clients are talking about struggling to provide basic needs carrying a designer bag is poor taste.", "NTA. Do not, DO NOT, do anything to potentially make your clients uncomfortable. This applies across all industries and positions.", "NTA, given the client base you want to be relatable and a $3500 bag is not relatable", "I agree with you, OP. \n\nIt shows poor situational awareness. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. And it's pretty privileged and ignorant of her that she needed to be told. There's a time and a place for her high end designer flexes. The clients home is not one of them. She doesn't need to dress from the dollar bin of the fleamarket. But toning it down to modest choices where the labels aren't literally screaming the name front and centre would be appropriate.\nIt wasnt an order or reprimand, you were polite and well reasoned and extended a lesson from professional experience in your advice to her. Your other coworkers are tasteless and wilfully ignorant showing such a lack of basic compassion to the clients.", "NTA.   My husband used to be an independent adjuster for homeowners insurance.  The company did not supply a vehicle so he had to use ours.   He was specifically told to NOT get an expensive vehicle BECAUSE of the reason you listed in this post.   All of the homeowners had JUST had very significant losses to their home, and some of them had entirely lost their homes due to hurricanes, tornados, fires, and other natural disasters.  It is very unprofessional to flaunt expensive things to people who are not so fortunate, and can make the client feel bad about what they cannot afford or do not have.", "If you are in charge of training her, then you are NTA. Carrying that bag into meetings with disadvantaged clients is extremely insensitive on her part.", "NTA, your coworker sounds immature if she can't read the room", "NTA\n I was also a CMHC provider.  Blending into our environment was part of the onboarding training.\n\nIt's also self protective.  Don't bring extra fabrics into a person's home. It's on the same level as wearing appropriate footwear.", "NTA. In my opinion, you just gave her some really constructive career advice that I hope she takes. This is a young woman, new to this career, and I think you took more of a mentorship approach. You didn\u2019t shame her, you didn\u2019t scold her, you were gentle and tactful in how you approached the situation. If she\u2019s mature and dedicated to this career path, she\u2019s going to look back at this interaction in 20 years and go \u201cwhat was I thinking\u201d and be thankful you were there. Also, of course it was awkward. Why is awkward always bad? Sometimes life lessons are awkward.", "NTA\n\nnot only us she rubbing her wealth in the noses if the people shes supposed to be supporting, sadly she's putting herself at risk for being mugged. \n\nBring it to hr. Its might actually be a good point to add into training.", "NTA. I agree with you, flashing designer brands in front of people who can't pay their energy bills, who rely on food banks, who live in substandard housing, is incredibly crass. It would tell me that this person does not understand the clients position. \n\nNow, their wealth may be recent. A year ago, they might have been living the same life as the clients. But the client isn't going to think that. They're going to think 'this person will not understand', and that is an unnecessary barrier. Especially when another bag could be used.", "NTA. It's tone deaf, point blank. \"Oh are you having trouble paying bills, well don't worry your poor little head, I'm here to help. Just let me set down by $$$ bag.\"\n\nThat bag is a rent payment. You're helping people who may well already be uncomfortable about the situation and her rocking up with a clearly very expensive bag, jewellery, clothing etc means they're way less likely to open up and be receptive to assistance.", "NTA. \n\nMy mother was a case manager for years before she retired, and she worked almost exclusively in very low income neighborhoods. \n\nShe has a few nicer handbags, nothing as fancy as Dior, but think Coach, Kate Spade, that sort of thing. She *never* took them on her home visits - she had a very nondescript black bag that went with her. She wore very simple clothes and no jewelry aside from her wedding band. \n\nThere's a time and place for designer things, and it is not for a job like this one. If anyone is telling you Y T A, they do not have an understanding of jobs like this, period.", "NTA, but you are also setting her up to have her car broken into for the designer bag even more than it already is. Never leave anything valuable in your car, especially not a purse! \n\nEdit: Yeah, really don't leave a *$4,000* purse in your car.", "NTA\n\nAppropriateness of attire is a consideration for all jobs. When dealing with external clients specifically, there's always a consideration of how things are perceived.\n\nWhen working in NFP sector, there's always people that are distrustful of any signs of extragavence. You didn't tell her to change her clothes, or bar her from bringing the bag in. You made a suggestion, as part of the training.\n\nI have family that works in NFP sector, and, often, people are surprised that she receives a salary. They feel everyone in the organization should be volunteers, so all money can go directly to the cause.\n\nYou did your job, which is to explain some of the norms of the job as you understand them. Its up to her whether she takes the advice.", "NTA\n\nYou were assigned to help train her and have her shadow you. That would include telling her when she's committing a unwritten faux pas that is determintal to doing her job. Showing up with a designer bag is likely to injure rapport with your clients.", "She shouldn't be carrying ANY bag into home visits. It's a safety issue. Personal belongings should be kept in the car. The only thing a person should bring to home visits is this ID badge and anything they need for note taking, paperwork etc.", "NTA you\u2019re potentially saving her from harm. Disadvantaged people often live in dangerous communities and you only want her to be able to relate and help your clientele and gain that trust you need to be able to work with them. Flaunting wealth is the easiest way to make their backs go up. I came from nothing and am now living in a very wealthy area and although I have a lot more than I did it still makes me roll my eyes to see brunching housewives with a nanny and house cleaner with their fancy nails, hair and clothes attempt to relate.", "NTA- as someone who also used to go into homes of people with less means than me, I didn\u2019t dress \u201cdown\u201d but I\u2019d dress casual and if I had expensive items, they stayed home or in the car. It isn\u2019t about not being flashy, but I\u2019m trying to be approachable.", "NTA, your experienced advice in this case was on the mark.", "NTA. I am a low-income, poverty-stricken person. If a helper came into my home carrying that bag, I would know instantly that all I would hear is fakeness and platitudes. Condescension would be felt by me. \n\n$4100 for a tote bag? I could survive four months on that much money. Who am I kidding? That is more than my ssdi is for four months. Carrying that bag in the places she would be going is a good way to get herself mugged and robbed.", "Was she really rolling out with a $4k bag. Is this job just a hobby for her? Yeesh. \n\nThat's not good judgement, optics or anything. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe bag is work appropriate, but not situational appropriate. Your coworker is pretty tone deaf about flaunting stuff, and you did the right thing. The real problem is that if you're talking to vulnerable people they aren't going to trust advice from someone who is clearly so well off they'd never have to take that advice themselves. How would they know it to be true if the person giving that advice would never be in that situation?", "NTA. I work with kids that come from poor family circumstances. When they ask about my weekend or holidays plans- I\u2019ll tell them what I\u2019ve got planned with my family and son. However, I wouldn\u2019t brag about how wonderful my life is with my family. It\u2019s tone deaf and in poor taste. I get where you are coming from.\n\nEdit: used wrong word.", "Lawyer here, whose wife works as a social worker for troubled kids in a poverty stricken area: absolutely NTA. You never, ever want to do anything to make your client uncomfortable and I know that bringing something like this bag to a home visit would be a complete no-no in her job that would result in a reprimand. Leave the designer stuff at home or in the office.", "I used to do home visits for low income clients. I never took a purse/bag with me when I was working in the community. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt was a valuable insight from a more seasoned professional.  To discard the advice and get upset over it is not the mark of a good employee.\n\nLike me telling a new co-worker, you shouldn't wear long sleeves around rotating machinery.  They can listen to good advice, or ignore it and get sucked into the wood chipper.", "NTA - no one will trust her. I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d be super bitter or think she is so out of touch if she was my point of contact, I wouldn\u2019t think she was there to help me, and I\u2019d question if the systems in place she\u2019s promoting were legit or appropriate for me.\n\n\nEdit: it also could come across as some tone deaf savior sh*t. Even if she has best of intentions, some folks could get legit mad about it, why even introduce that into the dynamic. I\u2019m picturing a \u201cyea, what do you know about this with your nice car and luxury bag\u201d.", "NTA. You are her mentor and are showing her the ropes. We can't judge someone who comes from a family of means, but we can point out that it is inappropriate and unprofessional to be using a bag like that when working with people in dire straights. That is exactly what you did, and you're helping her along in her training.", "As someone who works for a non profit that helps with disadvantaged people, you are 100% NTA. I have seen firsthand what clients do (And have processed way too many incident reports for theft - I work in IT with our database reporting system) and you absolutely did the right thing. I've learned to never have valuables on display when I have to interact with a client. Hopefully the co-worker doesn't learn this lesson the hard way.", "NTA\n\nJust a psa for the many comments about how people might want to steal the bag in \"the hood\" : Poor people don't just live in \"the hood\" with crime everywhere. And most don't want to steal the bag.  I know that might be possible in some places , and w some people,  but I just wanted to disrupt that stereotype a bit. I was a poor single mother in need of services myself and then I became a social worker and helped others so I have a lot of lived experience on this topic. \n\nMany people as have commented here would just think she has no idea how to relate to them and that the job is a hobby to her and that her empathy would appear patronizing.  Coming to work dressed professional but kind of ordinary is a lot more relatable for poor people than dressing up in name brands and stuff.  Some people  said let the natural consequences happen but honestly why use the clients that way.  They are the ones who matter and why upset them or alienate them just to teach this girl a lesson.  That seems off to me as well.\n\nI think the OP made a good choice.  I'm now an LCSW qualified to supervise folks in OPs position and I would approve of this.", "NTA", "NTA you trained her and that's part of the work etiquette.", "NTA\n\nI'll give her some wiggle room and say she might be a little young and a little sheltered to know any better. I think you did the right thing in pointing it out.\n\nHonestly, if I were a client and saw this woman walk in with that bag, I would think to myself: This person will do nothing for me, she can't possibly understand what I need.", "NTA\n\nThe reality is, the people with whom she will be working are often primed to distrust officials and social workers.  There can be an assumption that this person has no fucking idea what your life is like, and that assumption is often true.  People in rough situations have been jerked around by a lot of different systems, and it takes some care to alleviate distrust.\n\nYes, she should look professional.  But such an obvious piece of conspicuous consumption will go over like a lead balloon.  Poor people are not stupid.  They know what brands are.  And carrying around a $4000 purse is going to alienate them instantly.", "NTA. I do volunteer work with folks that may be low income/unhoused. I do not wear my Apple Watch when I do so. It was a gift but it still is a ridiculously expensive thing ($350). It\u2019s just common sense that your coworker seems to be lacking. NTA.", "NTA. I think that's a valid suggestion. It's up to your coworker to decide if she wants to take your advice. The CD bags with the name on the side are THE designer bag flex of 2021-2022 and they are very flashy. I can see why you'd think it was immodest or inappropriate when interacting with people who are struggling to pay for basic necessities.", "She may not have liked it but you\u2019re nta.", "NTA. This is like going and working in a soup kitchen but then sitting in the middle of the hall eating a wagyu steak soaked in caviar.", "NTA, you were being considerate for your clientele. She was having a bit of social ineptness in the moment, perhaps she\u2019ll think more deeply next time.", "There's a difference between being yourself, and flaunting your wealth.\n\nExpensive bags with obviously visible brand names are there to brag about how expensive the bag is.\n\nHere's a question to ask yourself. If you had a bag that was otherwise identical (same workmanship, same materials etc,), but didn't have a famous brand name plastered on it in large letters, would you consider it worth the same? If your answer is \"no\", then this is a status brag.\n\nFrankly, I think this kind of brag is vulgar, but YMMV.\n\nPart of your job is counseling new colleagues on how to behave, and part of that is certainly how to present herself. Does your employer have some kind of guidelines about appropriate dress for your position, or is this just you giving your \"common sense opinion\"?\n\nNTA", "NTA. When working with low-income clients in a career that relies on rapport, details matter. It might not be a problem for some, but for some, it might be. You were assigned to train her, and this is something she needs to be sensitive to when working with people. You could have delivered it a bit better, sandwiched it between compliments, but your point is valid.", "NTA. Her bag would cover her clients several months of rent", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m amazed she\u2019s willing to risk it tbh, I work a very similar job and have had clothing ripped, stained, been bitten by a dog\u2026.. the list goes on. I wear company clothing and cheap jeans/leggings and tops I don\u2019t mind getting damaged. I don\u2019t carry a handbag full stop as it\u2019s another thing to have to carry/remember, I just fill my pockets and carry my work bag. She\u2019ll learn!", "NTA. I've been on both ends of receiving help as a low income person, and working for companies that work with low income households. You build relationships with your clients, and that can be sometimes hard to do if there is such a vast difference in social economic status. \n\nNobody is saying she can't use her designer bag ever, but it would be in good taste to not bring this to work, especially in low income areas.", "NTA you are totally right. They way you phrased it and your tone will have a big effect on how it\u2019s received. Better the new girl learn this way than through a situation with a client", "Nta. That bag might be worth two months of income to some families.

Even tho it isn't her fault we are low income, it just makes the meeting uncomfortable for my side. That's just my opinion, you are training her, you did the right thing.. good luck!", "NTA, and I would give her this analogy. Say you have a sick kid who requires long term medical treatment. How would you feel if your doctor came in and repeatedly told you how healthy his/her kids are. Is the doctor technically accurate and within their rights to do so? Yes they are. Does it make them an AH. Also yes, because it's completely tone deaf in that situation. Same with your colleague - this was an inappropriate choice given the circumstances in which she chose to work. While I think she should know better, I think she could use additional training for this field of work - both to demonstrate tact and rapport with the families she helps.", "NTA for telling her this.  Most people have common sense, some don\u2019t. They don\u2019t realize how they make others feel.", "NTA. I work with low income clients and in grad school we were taught to go as far as turning wedding rings inside out to avoid all kinds of issues - rupture in rapport, making clients feel bad, risk of theft when giving community support. The most important thing is making yourself accessible to clients so they feel as though they have someone they can look to for support. Refraining from being \u201cshowy\u201d about your socioeconomic status is just another way of doing that.", "NTA. A lot of the HUDVASH providers at the VA don\u2019t dress up either.

Plus it can make her a target for theft or assault in low income areas.", "NTA\n\nIf you want your clients to feel comfortable with you, you don't flaunt that you have what they can't.

It would be one thing if it was an expensive leather bag without a brand name plastered on it maybe, but honestly that would put me off if I was in your clients shoes.", "NTA but as someone who has also worked with that population, I get it.  The clients aren\u2019t likely to trust or like her and might think that she thinks she\u2019s better.

I worked for social services and my supervisor was trying to get HR to change our dress code from business casual to casual.

They have been mistreated day in and day out by police officers, by medical staff who don't give a fuck about those poor people and often do medical malpractice on them, so on and so on.

If you're new to a job in your 20s little work gaffes like that can feel like a bigger deal than they are.", "Agreed.  The CW could be have been mortified at not realizing and hence the ackwardness.", "She complained about it to another coworker, meaning she didn't grasp WHY she was in the wrong. She wasn't embarrassed she was upset she couldn't bring her bag...", "I don\u2019t have any experience in social work but even I know you don\u2019t wear expensive clothes or accessories when meeting with disadvantaged folks. It\u2019s a dick move.", "I'd argue the other coworker that said OP overstepped is the AH here.", "Especially since she works with low income folks. Ah the bliss of ignorance \u2026", "New coworker doesn\u2019t know any better. Other more established coworker, who told OP that the bag was work-appropriate, on the other hand, should listen to OP instead of pushing back.", "Wealthy people don\u2019t tend to have the most common sense.", "Yes, NTA. All of the above. The last thing someone in a vulnerable position needs is a cute 20-something parading their privilege around. Even if the young woman is fabulous at her job in other areas, flaunting her wealth is not inspirational. It can feel very condescending and make her look completely out of touch.", "Or mugged.", "All that danger for an ugly ass bag. I mean, the embroidery is super cool, but the large CHRISTIAN DIOR covering like 1/4 of the design is a bit tacky imo. Why do people like being walking billboards for the brands they buy?", "Just young and blithely unaware of her privilege, I think.", "Yep, so it would be far better brought through hr, rather than being told by OP.\nStops any confusion, and what happened gets documented.", "It\u2019s almost 10 times mine and i live in a shoebox in an expensive city in Europe. Wtf", "That bag is three months rent for me and I live with my parents in an expensive city \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "I could squeeze out 3-4 in a bachelor in my area if I moved into the boonies.", "I saw a thread awhile back, I think on r/whatisthisbug, with a social worker who brought a tote into a home and came home with a special guest. There were a bunch of social workers in the comments sharing similar stories and tips to avoid it which included not bringing bags into client homes. So there\u2019s that to consider.", "Nah you\u2019re fine- I work nights and have been up longer than I should be. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f", "Hard agree. The list of things I was told not to wear to jury trials was\u2026extensive. I\u2019m not looking to alienate anyone. \n\nAlso, I used to be an attorney for kids in foster care, and their home situations were less than ideal. I had more than one visit where after we got a call about bedbugs, lice, etc. I don\u2019t own fancy stuff but I can just imagine a situation where that Dior bag has to get a heavy chemical treatment that decreases its value.", "Logos, while distasteful, IMO, are very \u201cin\u201d right now. She\u2019s young and unaware of her privilege. I\u2019m not sure this is as much about flaunting or bragging as it is being a victim of trends and social unawareness.", "I have one very similar- cost me \u00a310 (yes even with the designer name on!)", "They're not. They're saying for at least one of every 100 low income houses OP's co-worker visits statistics show she would be robbed flashing that bag. That's just a fact. She also will visit 'the hood' of her area during the course of her job more than once.", "My guess is a lot of political and conspiracy theory bumper stickers and other ephemera, based around Info Wars. I think there's actually a sub that showcases these but I can't remember the name.", "I think they might mean a pick-up truck covered in pro Trump and right wing propaganda.", "It was both. She had plenty of options including taking a subway from her office to the shelter.", "I honestly dont think its a bad thing at all to say. A lot of people are saying youre YTA but im gonna go wih NTA. I think most people calling you TA havent seen poverty and maybe have a hard time understanding the nature of the situation. Although its not insulting. And not everyone cares about the bag. Itd be good practise not to pick that purse for work", "That was 80 percent of my class when I was in social work school. Still in their early 20s, never paid a bill in their lives and thought they were qualified to give advice (their words) to clients.", "I came into the ER with two broken legs.  \n\nI didn't feel like the people walking around were mocking me. I didn't care if they were naked. \n\nBroken legs hurt a lot. \n\nI wanted people to walk quickly to me and make the pain stop. \n\nBy the way I do understand the point, It was just funny to me", ">Some people just don't have the situational/social awareness to work with people.\n\nYup, there's one.", "Well that\u2019s a shitty supervisor then and they would be TA. They are in charge of making sure their people are helping the clients to the best of the organization\u2019s ability. They should already have a clothing policy for the reasons I stated. Plus you don\u2019t want your employee to be caught in a dangerous situation. And you also want them to appear a certain way so as to convey empathy. If they don\u2019t have a policy for that already, they\u2019re very dumb.", "How? He knows that they are struggling to pay because he is the landlord. He\u2019s not judging.", "Yeah, op isn\u2019t an asshole but this guy is lol", "Thanks so much! \n\nYeah, I am totally 100% willing to change my mind on just about anything if someone presents a logical rebuttal or shows me why I\u2019m wrong.\n\nIn this case, I definitely was! I feel bad for thinking OP was the a-hole here when the reality is that she\u2019s a decent human being who cares about her clientele. Her friend could definitely use a lesson or two in understanding what it\u2019s like to be humble.", "Hey, no, I totally agree. I changed my vote because I thought it was a bag that was maybe a couple hundred dollars, but *$4,000*?! Now this girl is seriously just being flashy by carrying this around in front of clients who are not as wealthy.", "I had low income clients notice my \u201cnew car\u201d and make comments. It was a Jetta\u2026 and I was leasing it because I couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. It had never occurred to me that I was privileged, but in comparison to some people, I certainly was. You should definitely be mindful of things like that if you\u2019re going to work with people living in poverty.  I don\u2019t work with folks in poverty anymore but I still try to be mindful of appearances in front of clients.", "You must have made this comment before I changed my vote.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a different story now that OP has given the link to the bag with the cost. That\u2019s just insane honestly.", "I agree. This bag is wayyy too flashy to be walking around with in front of struggling clients.", "Haha, I can see why you don\u2019t like it too. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not my taste even though I think it\u2019s cute. Definitely not cute enough for a few grand or more haha", "Mee too! I was like oh man, this probably like a bag that\u2019s a couple hundred dollars and no biggie.\n\nThen I clicked the link and was like wtf, that\u2019s around the price of the used car I bought that I used to have years ago! I have a Disney bag and some Michael Kors clothing, and none of it was necessarily cheap but I would *never* pay four grand for a bag or anything else like this for that matter. \n\nI could definitely see a client feeling awful because they couldn\u2019t afford this. One day that bag is gonna fall apart and this girl pretty much threw $4,000 down the drain for this when this thing was probably cheaply made in China and not even worth the price.", "She\u2019s N T A for being humble and caring for her clients.\n\nThe price and bag weren\u2019t shown until it was added in following an edit. No one knew the cost of the bag until this was inserted.\n\nBut just as you are entitled to an opinion, so am I and feel that the bag is not worth the price. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s an a-hole for spending her money on it and you\u2019re putting words in my mouth.\n\nAnyone can say she wasted her money without someone else assuming that they\u2019re attacking her character or her choices.", "It\u2019s super cute, but not worth $4,000 for sure. It was probably made in a sweatshop somewhere which is bad enough.", "It also lessens the relationship she can and will have with them, because her world is so vastly different from theirs. Her bag is more than their monthly income. Those families are already struggling. Humility on your colleagues part would go a long way.", "Isn't this a safety issue as well? I mean she going to people's homes. Who knows who could \"set her up\".....", "Agreed. When working in a client-facing position, especially with vulnerable populations, it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re in the best position possible to built rapport and trust. Showing up with a bag that could pay their rent for half the year is so tone deaf and exhibits lack of respect, lack of experience, or a combination of the two. Awesome that she can afford these things but there\u2019s a time and a place to break out the designer bag. But a client\u2019s home ain\u2019t it.", "I have worked with people who were on benefits and I didn't change my clothing or accessories though I don't go for flashy or high end designer stuff. My winter coat is a brand favoured by royals but it's so understated you only realise the brand if you look inside. And I wasn't going to to buy a cheap and probably lower quality one just to fit in.\n\nAlso a lot of people who I have known in benefits seem to value the flashy brand over the more subtle brand, probably because it's the obvious how much they spent.", "Exactly, her getting robbed didn\u2019t enter my mind at all.  Being an absolute tone deaf dumbass for carrying a designer bag to work with clients struggling through poverty is a bad look and will affect her ability to assist her clients.", "If you don't think crime is higher in low income areas your living a fantasy. I'm 100% low income and it's sage advice.", "Personally I would bring it up to her supervisor and let them decide what to do and whether or not it\u2019s important", "But the rich are all around us.\nOn Facebook I see my neighbors flaunting their trips to warm climates.  All day where I work (I\u2019m a part time/minimum wage server) they come in after shopping and are carrying bags from the clothing store next door where I know even a basic shirt is $150 and talk about how they are going to \u201cthe spa\u201d afterwards.  They tip 10%. \n\nThis girl is at least doing something good so it\u2019s less annoying to me.", "Same. It would make me not want to work with her because I would find her hard to relate to", "I agree that this bag would throw off the underprivileged client and therefore would impede her work. It is highlighting their differences in wealth, not only an important and touchy subject but, also the reason that brings them there (one providing and the other needing help). It is not a good idea when someone is in a difficult position to bring visual reminders of the reasons. Especially if you are trying to assist them. Don't carry around a triggering item!", "and she'd get mugged, as well as possibly shot or stabbed or R'd. Very dangerous", "Never in my life could I have afforded a $4k bag so... idk what kind mentality a person must have who comes from that kind of money. \n\nWas probably just thoughtless on her part, but she better learn some self awareness quick if she wants to be successful in that kind of work.", "I think that\u2019s a bit much, sounds like escalating something that is an honest mistake. Going to HR feels like OP wants her to get in trouble. \n\nIf I was OP I would let it rest and maybe in a week or so ask her if she understands why she can\u2019t bring designer bags. If she understands and was just embarrassed then it\u2019s all fine. If she is becoming hostile and not understanding then HR would be the right move.", "Hope you sleep well!\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe", "Just a heads up for this sub, you should add spaces between the letters of a judgement you are just referencing (example: Y T A).  Otherwise, the algorithm may pick that up as your vote.", "Sorry, but really it's just not a good analogy.", "Nope, just can't make sense of you thinking walking in front of someone with a broken leg is 'mocking' them.", "IF it's real, it was made in Europe (likely Italy or Spain) and should hold up. If it's not real, it probably was made in China. However, you do not have to spend $4000 dollars for a European made bag that will not fall apart immediately. And said bag does not need a giant designer logo.", "haha I laughed when so many people assumed you can get anything at Dior for under $200. Most of their purses, even the mini's start at like $800.

I work in a similar environment and I don\u2019t even wear my wedding rings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe, and I\u2019m not going to sit across from someone asking me for food and me wearing a Diamond. It\u2019s tacky.", "This is a huge point for me. Yes, a discussion is needed, but not because of \"tackiness\"", "Except she was pretty much carrying around a designer billboard that also happens to hold things, she doesn't have that bag for the quality.", "That\u2019s not the point. Worrying about it being stolen is dense and obtuse compared to offending the people you\u2019re trying to help.", "No, now that would be the asshole move. She is giving a peer advice as she is training her. She is not demanding and she isn't trying to ruin this girl. She was gently letting her know it might not be the best idea.", "HR is also often the entity that structures training. The commenter above you does not mean \u201crat them out and get them in trouble\u201d they mean \u201cbring it to HR\u2019s attention that they need to include this topic as training for the future since it\u2019s already been an issue that was clearly not structured to new employees\u201d. \n\n\nThis is a failure of HR and the company of not training the employee and possibly putting them in a dangerous situation. HR needs to improve.", "\u2026. He meant like constantly walking around them talking to them about how he can walk are you stupid?", "I totally agree with you.\n\nI still have cute bags in my closet that are still in tact that I maybe spent in between $40-$100 on and they\u2019re still in perfect condition. I can\u2019t see why anyone would want to spend this kind of money on a bag unless they\u2019re trying to show off.", "Holy crap.\n\nIt\u2019s only worth it if you plan to flush your money down the toilet. \ud83d\ude02", "Thanks for sharing!\n\nDesigner items are sometimes very questionable as far as how they\u2019re made. I\u2019ll have to watch this for sure.", "There\u2019s a video of a gentleman making LV men\u2019s loafers that is just as satisfying as this video. I love seeing craftsmanship.", "This. My sister works with lower income POC families. She is in their house for hours. She was very sensitive of the optics of coming in looking like a \u201crich whole lady\u201d trying to tell them how to run their lives and raise their kids. She\u2019s literally like a part of the family now, but she took pains early on to build trust and rapport and dispel a lot of assumptions that she was judging or couldn\u2019t understand their issues. \n\nPeople are opening up their home to you, making themselves vulnerable, and it helps to meet them at their level. Not because they will be offended or hurt by a $3k bag but because it others you immediately and makes it more difficult to connect. You\u2019re already in a position of \u201cauthority,\u201d and highlighting class and social differences is a distraction at the very least.", "Those two thoughts shouldn\u2019t be mutually exclusive. For the sake of empathy and compassion, you should consider how offensive the bag is. For the sake of personal safety, you should absolutely consider your surroundings.", "It is a basic question about a confusing sentence, why be a jackass over it?", "Totally!!  Generally I would agree but this version of this bag in particular I think is remarkable and does require skill/effort (though who\u2019s to say if it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d $4k)!", "I grew up in a poor neighborhood.  If someone came into the neighborhood carrying a designer bag chances were pretty good they were not leaving the neighborhood with that bag."]}
