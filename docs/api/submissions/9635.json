When you tell her to wait make sure you explain to her why as opposed to just telling her to wait. A simple, \"Nikki, please wait to get your second helping until everyone has been able to get their food first. Once everyone has fixed their plates, you can get more. We want to make sure there is enough food for everyone.\" should be fine. Based on what you said, your SIL is making this something it's not.\n\n>take her plate and finish before everyone has sat down\n\nYou could set a basic house rule that no one starts eating until everyone has their plate and is sitting at the table as this is also basic etiquette and table manners.", "NTA. This behavior is what used to be called greedy. She needs to learn to a) actually care if others don\u2019t get enough because she\u2019s only thinking of herself and b) actually care if others view her as selfish.

When you make the meal, you want other people to eat it.", "NTA you are teaching her basic manners. Your SIL had a potentially valid concern but shouldn\u2019t have tried to overrule you in public like that.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing a great job as a parent to ensure your daughter doesn\u2019t only see her needs and setting her up to be able to navigate future social situations.  As a fellow member of society,  thank you,  this is one less AH that I may bump into in the future. \n\nYou are not going to win with your in-laws in this.   They see it as a single incident,  where you see the trends and are trying to think long term.  Ignore them for a minute. \n\nYour wife's reaction is a bit concerning.  In order to not have her feel attacked,  probe about how she feels about the WHOLE situation.  She may not even think it's a problem at all, much less at your SIL's place.   If that's the case,  you two should compare notes to come to a cohesive patenting plan.

Everyone else is though.", "NTA, I have a friend who does not have this etiquette and will take seconds and thirds sometimes before people have gotten their plate even. She is no longer able to eat/ stay the night at my apartment on the request of my roommates, but my parents still invite her over to their house, and she does this. It's an important thing to teach as no one enjoys making a meal only for it all to be eaten before they have a chance to eat.", "NTA - That's basic kindergarten level manners.", "NTA. it\u2019s basic manners to not get seconds before everyone has even gotten their first plate. and you\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t need to be eating that fast. she has to know that she\u2019s not the only person there that matters, and saying things like \u201c can i finally eat now \u201c is manipulating her words to make you look like you\u2019re restricting her food, whenever she does that you should make it clear she DID eat and she can wait until everyone has been served before she gets seconds", "NTA. And your wife should have your back. Self control that isn't naturally picked up on needs to be taught. If your daughter cannot think of others she has to be guided to it.", "NTA, like you said, you didn't stop her from eating, you were teaching her food related manners. The basics includes that you usually wait to begin eating until everyone has gotten their food (in Sweden we say that if there are less then eight people at the table you wait until everyone has gotten their food, larger companies you can eat directly so your food doesn't go cold) and you wait to get seconds until everyone has gotten their first plate. It's not shaming her from eating. It's manners.", "NTA, this is just teaching basic manners. She's 11 and should be able to do that.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t tell her she couldn\u2019t eat, just she has to wait to get seconds, not first. Your in laws are AHs for butting in.

You need to help her be less selfish.", "NTA.\n\nIt's sad how many times this page features good parents asking if they are assholes.\n\nSometimes being a good parent means letting others *think* you are an asshole, but in reality you are not and they are.", "NTA in my opinion. I see how it looked out of the context for your in-laws, but I think you're right. Of course bringing up a child includes teaching them discipline and manners. \n\nMaybe also try to talk to Nikki about it, so that she doesn't feel like you are mistreating her or being violent, and that there's a rational reason for this.  Also, it's important to reassure children that you still love them regardless in the process of teaching them discipline (!!!) \n\nPlus, talking to your wife and in-laws about the issue might be helpful for more support", "**NTA**\n\nThis has nothing to do with shaming her for the amount she eats. You're teaching her basic manners and how not to behave like she's a starved feral animal, especially in social situations. \n\nI don't know any decent, involved, thoughtful parents who would allow their children to behave like your wife is, or like her family was encouraging. The rule is ALWAYS \"everyone gets firsts before you go back for seconds\". It's just being polite, to ensure that there is enough food so that everyone CAN have firsts and that there will even be anything left over for seconds, as you yourself noted.\n\nAnd frankly, your wife isn't doing her any favours letting her eat like that at home. As you've said, it's terrible for her digestion to be gulping everything down, but she's also encouraging her to be rude and thoughtless to everyone else in the family. It's not going to make her any friends when she's older. This is literally basic table etiquette: you get your food, sit down, wait for everyone else to get theirs and eat TOGETHER (assuming it's a family meal, which is what you've described). It sounds like your wife was raised with either no manners or terrible ones, and is passing them on. You are NTA, but her family definitely are.", "NTA. If this behavior continues into her teens and adult age, people will notice and judge her for it. What the heck is wrong with people acting like kids are so sensitive they can't take any criticism.", "NTA\n\nNo, she can't be getting seconds before others have even had a chance to get a serving.  Waiting 30 minutes for seconds to ensure everyone else gets *any* is not the end of the world, and insisting on it is not shaming.  It *is* rude to take seconds before others have been served at all, and your wife is wrong to insist she be allowed to do so.  \n\nThe wait is also good for her.  After 20+ minutes of finishing a meal we can better assess whether we're *actually* still hungry.  She won't get any chance to practice that if she's never expected to wait.\n\nBut some things to think about.  Is she getting appropriate serving sizes for her age?\n\nYou mention at the start that you believe she eats in a rush to quickly go back to whatever she was doing, but that doesn't quite match up with also demanding seconds.  If she was just in a rush to do other things, you'd be having issues with her potentially *undereating.*  She wouldn't be spending time hovering in the kitchen - you might struggle to get her to the table to eat in the first place.  That's more often how kids who eat in a rush because it's just a distraction from other stuff they want to be doing operate.  \n\nThis is a kid who devours her meal then demands more.  Is she really getting enough?  If so, has any of this been addressed with her doctor?  Has she been assessed for things like thyroid issues and others which can cause appetite disturbances?  Is there anything in her earlier childhood history which might make her feel food-insecure?  I get that 11 year olds can be inconsiderate at times, because, well, they're 11.  But how she is around food overall is *not* typical age-appropriate behavior, and it warrants looking into.\n\n\nDefinitely continue having her wait for 20+ minutes before serving her seconds.  But don't just write all of this off as greed just yet, either.   It *could* be, but other things need to be ruled out first.", "NTA, but be prepared to be told by several people who would let children have any kind of freedom over any decision that you are one. \n\nI know way too many people well into their thirties who have zero social awareness like this, it\u2019s best to teach her young.", "Nta\n\nYou are trying to teach your kid manners.", "NTA. It's not a food restriction thing, it's a politeness thing.", "NTA.\n\nI thought it was good manners to wait to get seconds until everyone has had firsts. \n\nYou\u2019re teaching her good manners, this has nothing to do with how much she\u2019s eating.

It sounds as if you are attempting to teach her proper manners and etiquette.", "NTA- It's not a health issue. It is a politeness and etiquette issue. She needs to learn now, before she grows up and grosses people out or drives friends or partners away.\n\nSIL had a valid concern, but she's an outsider, so she needs to stay in her lane, as well as the rest of wife's family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Apparently someone at the table didn't get a Hamburger because everyone grabbed as many as they asked for because again, my dad jsut said food was ready and disappeared and when I sat down that's all that was left. He came back inside moments later and realized what happened and instead of just saying I forgot to tell you I only made everyone one burger for now he flipped his lid and singled me out even the others actually had more. I apologized, offered the other burger that was untouched to the other person at the table but it turned out my pig of a brother took hers because she doesn't like cheese and he didn't pay attention. He was the first to sit down and just grabbed a ton of food which he always does which makes everyone else panic and grab their food because he's inconsiderate. So she didn't want the burger which made my dad even angrier. The next morning at breakfast everyone was so on edge nobody ate more tba than once pancake until being given to the explicit permission to have another one because he flipped out the door before and threw a tantrum. We grew up with food insecurity after my dad and my. Pm divorced and he stopped paying child support for a while.

Second, when she's a teenager and has a wacky schedule or a lot of homework and needs an early or late dinner, she should be able to fix something for herself. \n\nI wonder how snacks/eating outside of meals plays into this.

Talk about being polite and considerate. My Mom had that talk with me when I was somewhere around 9 or 10. Explain how important it is to chew her food so she doesn\u2019t choke, and that eating too fast and too much is what\u2019s making her tummy hurt. It takes awhile for the brain to get the message that the brain is full. It isn\u2019t weight shaming to couch it in being polite and fair to others. (At her age being fair is really, really important.) Set goals for her that are attainable rather quickly. Start with requiring her to wait to take her first bite until everyone is seated. Once she can do that every day for a week or two (agree on the length of time), she gets a reward. Not a food reward, though. Next, she can work on that AND waiting until one other person has finished their first plate before she gets seconds, if that\u2019s what she wants, after waiting. Remind her that it takes time for her stomach to decide. She cannot leave the table for any reason other than to go to the bathroom. Again, once she can manage those two things every day for a week or two, you can reward her. Praise her verbally for what she\u2019s doing right. A lot of times, those two things tend to moderate how quickly she eats, and therefore how much she eats. Just sitting there watching everyone eating gets really boring, so it\u2019s easier to slow down. If she\u2019s interested, maybe your ultimate goal is to take her to a really nice restaurant, or her favorite restaurant, so she can show off her new skills.

We starting eating after we said our blessing on the food, but other families require that the kids could start to eat when one of the parents started. We could only leave the table with their permission. Back then my parents only had to contend with the TV, so the TV was turned off. My nieces require that all electronic devices be left somewhere else in the house. Dinner was an electronic-free zone. We\u2019d practice our manners at home, and periodically (maybe every month or two) we\u2019d go to a sit down restaurant and show off our manners. Invariably somebody would stop and comment on what nice kids we were! I also make a point of complimenting kids and parents at restaurants. \n\nExplain to your wife and sister-in-law what you\u2019re doing. This isn\u2019t about how much she\u2019s eating.

What Nikki is learning is that mom lets her do whatever she wants and dad is an \"asshole.\"", "NTA I used to be that kid it wasn't until my mum said I should slow down and wait did I realise that I was over eating and not giving my mum a chance to sit and enjoy her portion. It kinda breaks up any conversation happening just for food. You did the right thing.", "I probably would have only done this in my own family. Extended family always have their 2 pence. So try and slow her down for all the reasons given but start in home. Try her to get to enjoy the entire dinner experience first with just your family. Maybe saying no matter how fast you eat we will all stay at this dinner table until everyone has finished.", "NAH \nthat\u2019s just how ur kid is and if the host said it\u2019s fine than it\u2019s fine. I understand ur intentions and I don\u2019t understand the hate you received but I think you could have just talked to your daughter before/after about manner and whatnot.", "Agreed NTA\n\nWent to a wedding once where the bride and groom didn't get any of the steak because some of the guests had seconds and thirds before they got food, was crazy.", "Me too and they are the ones you never invite to the BBQ or the potluck", "But it's old enough to learn and know better.", "Yes it is. Pretty easy to Google if you cared to. First one is more generic:\n\n>having or showing an intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth or power. \"greedy thieves who plundered a defense contractor\"\n\nWith the second being:\n\n>having an excessive desire or appetite for food\n\nIt is excessive and unnecessary for anyone to eat so much that someone else goes hungry. Especially when there is enough food for everyone. \n\nAnd dude. What the hell does weight have to do with this? There are overweight people who barely eat anything and skinny people who can out eat a sumo wrestler. You do not have to be fat to be greedy.", "NTA Thank you for teaching your daughter basic manners.  Your wife is completely wrong.  It's okay for children to feel a range of emotions while growing up, including disappointment, when they learn how to behave outside of their home.  It will not traumatize them, or cause an eating disorder. It just helps them be better people.", " And \"how Nikki is\" is rude.  \n\nImagine this behaviour when she is a guest at her friend's house.  Is she invited to sleep-overs?  Because if she is, she either knows how to behave or her friends' parents are very tolerant.\n\nOf the adults you are NTA and the others need to either step back (your in-laws) or back you up (your wife).", "NTA. If anything, this will prevent eating problems in the future. I\u2019ve had issues with eating so much food in one sitting because I couldn\u2019t eat slowly, so I wasn\u2019t feeling full. I had to teach myself as an adult how to eat more effectively. \n\nOne tip I\u2019ve seen it to put the food/utensils down in between bites. Don\u2019t pick it back up again until you\u2019ve swallowed what you bit off. Also, practice taking a drink of water after every few bites.", ">And your daughter is learning to be manipulative by weaponizing her phrasing. The way she worded that, she knew she\u2019d get a rise because SIL had already said something.\n\nYes, this misrepresentation needs to be addressed as well. \n\nTell her that you think she used the wrong phrasing on purpose. Of course, she'll play dumb. And that's ok, just spell out what phrasing she should use in the future. \n\nIn fact, you should instruct not to even ask you. She should be checking with the other guests if they already had their helping. And she shouldn't even ask them if it's really obvious they haven't had it yet. \n\nAnd she needs to do this whether you're present or not present. This is what it takes to learn to be a grown up.", "NTA\n\nYou said Nikki does this to get back to what she was doing, but if she is hovering in the kitchen for the food to be ready and consistently gets seconds before others are done I think this is about being able to get that second helping not about getting back to something else. This sounds like a bigger issue. Almost like she is afraid she won\u2019t get enough food, but it sounds like that would be an irrational fear.", "My dad always enforced two things: one does not begin eating until the cook is seated (meaning my mother - complete respect). One is not permitted to get seconds until others are at least half way through the first plate AND the hungry one must ask the table if anyone wants seconds. These rules at home have been carried down and earned many comments from relatives about polite behavior."]}
