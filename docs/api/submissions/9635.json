It's not any kind of eating disorder, she's just always eager to finish her meal and get back to whatever it is she was doing or wants to do. When my wife cooks, she'll linger in the kitchen waiting for food to be finished cooking, take her plate and finish before everyone has sat down. There are times she'll be getting seconds before anyone else has been able to get their first plate which has led to instances of there not being enough for everyone.\n\nWhen I cook, I plate everyone's food at once so she sits with the rest of the family and starts eating with the rest of us. There are a few reasons I'm trying to nip this: Reduce risk of choking and upset stomach (she's had a few tummyaches over it), ensuring everyone gets some the times ingredients aren't plentiful, and etiquette- I want her to be able to share with others when she's older at parties and the like. We went to my sister-in-law's house for dinner. We got there early and dinner was already cooked. There wasn't a plan for everyone to sit and eat together and sis-in-law invited us to get our plates. Nikki got hers and before those already there had all gotten a plate, she was already going back for more. \n\nI took her plate and told her she had to wait to get seconds so we could make sure everyone got some.

I asked her to please not interfere because I wasn't telling Nikki she couldn't have more, only that she has to wait for everyone else to arrive and get theirs first. Waiting thirty minutes wouldn't be the end of the world. Nikki sat pouting at the table and when everyone had arrived and starting serving themselves, she asked me if she could finally eat. That got me a lot of stares from some of my wife's family who told me I should've just let her eat.

You definitely don't go for seconds when people haven't even been served yet. And if you're eating as a group, its often polite to wait until everyone is served and sat; or at least the majority.", "NTA.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having her wait to get seconds if everyone hasn't been served their first serving - this is basic etiquette and respect for others. When you tell her to wait make sure you explain to her why as opposed to just telling her to wait. A simple, \"Nikki, please wait to get your second helping until everyone has been able to get their food first. Once everyone has fixed their plates, you can get more. We want to make sure there is enough food for everyone.\" should be fine. Based on what you said, your SIL is making this something it's not.\n\n>take her plate and finish before everyone has sat down\n\nYou could set a basic house rule that no one starts eating until everyone has their plate and is sitting at the table as this is also basic etiquette and table manners.", "NTA. This behavior is what used to be called greedy. She needs to learn to a) actually care if others don\u2019t get enough because she\u2019s only thinking of herself and b) actually care if others view her as selfish. This kid is crying out to be taught to cook. Put her in the kitchen and have her help prepare meals. When you make the meal, you want other people to eat it.", "NTA you are teaching her basic manners. Your SIL had a potentially valid concern but shouldn\u2019t have tried to overrule you in public like that.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing a great job as a parent to ensure your daughter doesn\u2019t only see her needs and setting her up to be able to navigate future social situations.  As a fellow member of society,  thank you,  this is one less AH that I may bump into in the future. \n\nYou are not going to win with your in-laws in this.   They see it as a single incident,  where you see the trends and are trying to think long term.  Ignore them for a minute. \n\nYour wife's reaction is a bit concerning.  In order to not have her feel attacked,  probe about how she feels about the WHOLE situation.  She may not even think it's a problem at all, much less at your SIL's place.   If that's the case,  you two should compare notes to come to a cohesive patenting plan.   You won't be able to steer your daughter clear of this problem if her mom didn't even think it's one. \n\nGood luck", "NTA, you\u2019re teaching your 11 yr old common courtesy. YOU are the parent and your wife in my book is blatantly disregarding a serious issue.", "NTA. Nobody should be helping themselves to seconds before everyone else has had a serving. As you are aware, that's how you end up with not enough food to allow everyone to have some.", "NTA at all, she's behaving like a brat and I hope you pulled her up for trying to make you look bad in front of everyone.", "NTA. You have valid reasons for why you are asking her to wait. It's very rude and unfair to everyone else if she's going back for seconds when others haven't had their first plate. She isn't too young to learn to be considerate of others.", "NTA... Everyone else is though.", "NTA, I have a friend who does not have this etiquette and will take seconds and thirds sometimes before people have gotten their plate even. She is no longer able to eat/ stay the night at my apartment on the request of my roommates, but my parents still invite her over to their house, and she does this. It's an important thing to teach as no one enjoys making a meal only for it all to be eaten before they have a chance to eat.", "NTA - That's basic kindergarten level manners.", "NTA. it\u2019s basic manners to not get seconds before everyone has even gotten their first plate. and you\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t need to be eating that fast. she has to know that she\u2019s not the only person there that matters, and saying things like \u201c can i finally eat now \u201c is manipulating her words to make you look like you\u2019re restricting her food, whenever she does that you should make it clear she DID eat and she can wait until everyone has been served before she gets seconds", "NTA. And your wife should have your back. Self control that isn't naturally picked up on needs to be taught. If your daughter cannot think of others she has to be guided to it.", "NTA, like you said, you didn't stop her from eating, you were teaching her food related manners. The basics includes that you usually wait to begin eating until everyone has gotten their food (in Sweden we say that if there are less then eight people at the table you wait until everyone has gotten their food, larger companies you can eat directly so your food doesn't go cold) and you wait to get seconds until everyone has gotten their first plate. It's not shaming her from eating. It's manners.", "NTA, this is just teaching basic manners. She's 11 and should be able to do that.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t tell her she couldn\u2019t eat, just she has to wait to get seconds, not first. Your in laws are AHs for butting in. And your daughter is learning to be manipulative by weaponizing her phrasing. The way she worded that, she knew she\u2019d get a rise because SIL had already said something.", "NTA. One of my kids is a speedy eater and asks for seconds before everyone else is finished their first (and sometimes before everyone has gotten to eat). I tell him he has to chill and wait because he's not the only person at the table that matters.", "NTA.\nSupper time isn't just \"let's get fed\".  It's \"let's talk to each other and spend time with the family.\"  As you say, Nikki is getting seconds before the meal has even been served to everybody else.\n\nRemind your wife that part of your job, as parents, is to teach children to be kind and polite to other people.  \"Just now Nikki is\", in this case, is unkind and rude.  You need to help her be less selfish.", "NTA.\n\nIt's sad how many times this page features good parents asking if they are assholes.\n\nSometimes being a good parent means letting others *think* you are an asshole, but in reality you are not and they are.", "NTA in my opinion. I see how it looked out of the context for your in-laws, but I think you're right. Of course bringing up a child includes teaching them discipline and manners. \n\nMaybe also try to talk to Nikki about it, so that she doesn't feel like you are mistreating her or being violent, and that there's a rational reason for this.  Also, it's important to reassure children that you still love them regardless in the process of teaching them discipline (!!!) \n\nPlus, talking to your wife and in-laws about the issue might be helpful for more support", "**NTA**\n\nThis has nothing to do with shaming her for the amount she eats. You're teaching her basic manners and how not to behave like she's a starved feral animal, especially in social situations. \n\nI don't know any decent, involved, thoughtful parents who would allow their children to behave like your wife is, or like her family was encouraging. The rule is ALWAYS \"everyone gets firsts before you go back for seconds\". It's just being polite, to ensure that there is enough food so that everyone CAN have firsts and that there will even be anything left over for seconds, as you yourself noted.\n\nAnd frankly, your wife isn't doing her any favours letting her eat like that at home. As you've said, it's terrible for her digestion to be gulping everything down, but she's also encouraging her to be rude and thoughtless to everyone else in the family. It's not going to make her any friends when she's older. This is literally basic table etiquette: you get your food, sit down, wait for everyone else to get theirs and eat TOGETHER (assuming it's a family meal, which is what you've described). It sounds like your wife was raised with either no manners or terrible ones, and is passing them on. You are NTA, but her family definitely are.", "NTA. If this behavior continues into her teens and adult age, people will notice and judge her for it. What the heck is wrong with people acting like kids are so sensitive they can't take any criticism.", "NTA\n\nNo, she can't be getting seconds before others have even had a chance to get a serving.  Waiting 30 minutes for seconds to ensure everyone else gets *any* is not the end of the world, and insisting on it is not shaming.  It *is* rude to take seconds before others have been served at all, and your wife is wrong to insist she be allowed to do so.  \n\nThe wait is also good for her.  After 20+ minutes of finishing a meal we can better assess whether we're *actually* still hungry.  She won't get any chance to practice that if she's never expected to wait.\n\nBut some things to think about.  Is she getting appropriate serving sizes for her age?\n\nYou mention at the start that you believe she eats in a rush to quickly go back to whatever she was doing, but that doesn't quite match up with also demanding seconds.  If she was just in a rush to do other things, you'd be having issues with her potentially *undereating.*  She wouldn't be spending time hovering in the kitchen - you might struggle to get her to the table to eat in the first place.  That's more often how kids who eat in a rush because it's just a distraction from other stuff they want to be doing operate.  \n\nThis is a kid who devours her meal then demands more.  Is she really getting enough?  If so, has any of this been addressed with her doctor?  Has she been assessed for things like thyroid issues and others which can cause appetite disturbances?  Is there anything in her earlier childhood history which might make her feel food-insecure?  I get that 11 year olds can be inconsiderate at times, because, well, they're 11.  But how she is around food overall is *not* typical age-appropriate behavior, and it warrants looking into.\n\n\nDefinitely continue having her wait for 20+ minutes before serving her seconds.  But don't just write all of this off as greed just yet, either.   It *could* be, but other things need to be ruled out first.", "NTA, but be prepared to be told by several people who would let children have any kind of freedom over any decision that you are one. \n\nI know way too many people well into their thirties who have zero social awareness like this, it\u2019s best to teach her young.", "Nta\n\nYou are trying to teach your kid manners.", "NTA. It's not a food restriction thing, it's a politeness thing.", "NTA.\n\nI thought it was good manners to wait to get seconds until everyone has had firsts. \n\nYou\u2019re teaching her good manners, this has nothing to do with how much she\u2019s eating. People are trying to start shit for no reason.", "NTA\n\nHer just being the way she is, is the reason she needs parenting. It sounds as if you are attempting to teach her proper manners and etiquette.", "NTA- It's not a health issue. It is a politeness and etiquette issue. She needs to learn now, before she grows up and grosses people out or drives friends or partners away.\n\nSIL had a valid concern, but she's an outsider, so she needs to stay in her lane, as well as the rest of wife's family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For example, when she lingers in the kitchen, she'll keep looking where her sketchbook or tablet is. If we let her, she'd be eating the last few bites when she goes to put her dish in the sink. Her portion sizes are correct for her age as well. She has a healthy appetite, and we keep healthy snacks in the house for her and her siblings, they all eat them.", "Given how the wife/mother berated OP when they got home, I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one enabling it, not him.", "Yes.
