When you tell her to wait make sure you explain to her why as opposed to just telling her to wait. A simple, \"Nikki, please wait to get your second helping until everyone has been able to get their food first. Once everyone has fixed their plates, you can get more. We want to make sure there is enough food for everyone.\" should be fine. Based on what you said, your SIL is making this something it's not.\n\n>take her plate and finish before everyone has sat down\n\nYou could set a basic house rule that no one starts eating until everyone has their plate and is sitting at the table as this is also basic etiquette and table manners.", "NTA. This behavior is what used to be called greedy. She needs to learn to a) actually care if others don\u2019t get enough because she\u2019s only thinking of herself and b) actually care if others view her as selfish.

As a fellow member of society,  thank you,  this is one less AH that I may bump into in the future. \n\nYou are not going to win with your in-laws in this.   They see it as a single incident,  where you see the trends and are trying to think long term.  Ignore them for a minute. \n\nYour wife's reaction is a bit concerning.  In order to not have her feel attacked,  probe about how she feels about the WHOLE situation.  She may not even think it's a problem at all, much less at your SIL's place.   If that's the case,  you two should compare notes to come to a cohesive patenting plan.

Everyone else is though.", "NTA, I have a friend who does not have this etiquette and will take seconds and thirds sometimes before people have gotten their plate even. She is no longer able to eat/ stay the night at my apartment on the request of my roommates, but my parents still invite her over to their house, and she does this. It's an important thing to teach as no one enjoys making a meal only for it all to be eaten before they have a chance to eat.", "NTA - That's basic kindergarten level manners.", "NTA. it\u2019s basic manners to not get seconds before everyone has even gotten their first plate. and you\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t need to be eating that fast. she has to know that she\u2019s not the only person there that matters, and saying things like \u201c can i finally eat now \u201c is manipulating her words to make you look like you\u2019re restricting her food, whenever she does that you should make it clear she DID eat and she can wait until everyone has been served before she gets seconds", "NTA. And your wife should have your back. Self control that isn't naturally picked up on needs to be taught. If your daughter cannot think of others she has to be guided to it.", "NTA, like you said, you didn't stop her from eating, you were teaching her food related manners. The basics includes that you usually wait to begin eating until everyone has gotten their food (in Sweden we say that if there are less then eight people at the table you wait until everyone has gotten their food, larger companies you can eat directly so your food doesn't go cold) and you wait to get seconds until everyone has gotten their first plate.

I see how it looked out of the context for your in-laws, but I think you're right. Of course bringing up a child includes teaching them discipline and manners. \n\nMaybe also try to talk to Nikki about it, so that she doesn't feel like you are mistreating her or being violent, and that there's a rational reason for this.  Also, it's important to reassure children that you still love them regardless in the process of teaching them discipline (!!!) \n\nPlus, talking to your wife and in-laws about the issue might be helpful for more support", "**NTA**\n\nThis has nothing to do with shaming her for the amount she eats. You're teaching her basic manners and how not to behave like she's a starved feral animal, especially in social situations. \n\nI don't know any decent, involved, thoughtful parents who would allow their children to behave like your wife is, or like her family was encouraging. The rule is ALWAYS \"everyone gets firsts before you go back for seconds\". It's just being polite, to ensure that there is enough food so that everyone CAN have firsts and that there will even be anything left over for seconds, as you yourself noted.\n\nAnd frankly, your wife isn't doing her any favours letting her eat like that at home. As you've said, it's terrible for her digestion to be gulping everything down, but she's also encouraging her to be rude and thoughtless to everyone else in the family. It's not going to make her any friends when she's older. This is literally basic table etiquette: you get your food, sit down, wait for everyone else to get theirs and eat TOGETHER (assuming it's a family meal, which is what you've described). It sounds like your wife was raised with either no manners or terrible ones, and is passing them on. You are NTA, but her family definitely are.", "NTA. If this behavior continues into her teens and adult age, people will notice and judge her for it. What the heck is wrong with people acting like kids are so sensitive they can't take any criticism.", "NTA\n\nNo, she can't be getting seconds before others have even had a chance to get a serving.  Waiting 30 minutes for seconds to ensure everyone else gets *any* is not the end of the world, and insisting on it is not shaming.  It *is* rude to take seconds before others have been served at all, and your wife is wrong to insist she be allowed to do so.  \n\nThe wait is also good for her.  After 20+ minutes of finishing a meal we can better assess whether we're *actually* still hungry.  She won't get any chance to practice that if she's never expected to wait.\n\nBut some things to think about.  Is she getting appropriate serving sizes for her age?\n\nYou mention at the start that you believe she eats in a rush to quickly go back to whatever she was doing, but that doesn't quite match up with also demanding seconds.  If she was just in a rush to do other things, you'd be having issues with her potentially *undereating.*  She wouldn't be spending time hovering in the kitchen - you might struggle to get her to the table to eat in the first place.  That's more often how kids who eat in a rush because it's just a distraction from other stuff they want to be doing operate.  \n\nThis is a kid who devours her meal then demands more.  Is she really getting enough?  If so, has any of this been addressed with her doctor?  Has she been assessed for things like thyroid issues and others which can cause appetite disturbances?  Is there anything in her earlier childhood history which might make her feel food-insecure?  I get that 11 year olds can be inconsiderate at times, because, well, they're 11.  But how she is around food overall is *not* typical age-appropriate behavior, and it warrants looking into.\n\n\nDefinitely continue having her wait for 20+ minutes before serving her seconds.  But don't just write all of this off as greed just yet, either.   It *could* be, but other things need to be ruled out first.", "NTA, but be prepared to be told by several people who would let children have any kind of freedom over any decision that you are one. \n\nI know way too many people well into their thirties who have zero social awareness like this, it\u2019s best to teach her young.", "Nta\n\nYou are trying to teach your kid manners.", "NTA.

It sounds as if you are attempting to teach her proper manners and etiquette.", "NTA- It's not a health issue. It is a politeness and etiquette issue. She needs to learn now, before she grows up and grosses people out or drives friends or partners away.\n\nSIL had a valid concern, but she's an outsider, so she needs to stay in her lane, as well as the rest of wife's family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Apparently someone at the table didn't get a Hamburger because everyone grabbed as many as they asked for because again, my dad jsut said food was ready and disappeared and when I sat down that's all that was left. He came back inside moments later and realized what happened and instead of just saying I forgot to tell you I only made everyone one burger for now he flipped his lid and singled me out even the others actually had more. I apologized, offered the other burger that was untouched to the other person at the table but it turned out my pig of a brother took hers because she doesn't like cheese and he didn't pay attention. He was the first to sit down and just grabbed a ton of food which he always does which makes everyone else panic and grab their food because he's inconsiderate. So she didn't want the burger which made my dad even angrier. The next morning at breakfast everyone was so on edge nobody ate more tba than once pancake until being given to the explicit permission to have another one because he flipped out the door before and threw a tantrum. We grew up with food insecurity after my dad and my. Pm divorced and he stopped paying child support for a while.

Second, when she's a teenager and has a wacky schedule or a lot of homework and needs an early or late dinner, she should be able to fix something for herself. \n\nI wonder how snacks/eating outside of meals plays into this.
