It doesn't really apply to entertaining at home. So while you may be miffed at guests leaving (what you consider to be) early, they don't owe you anything but thanks. So in this case, YTA.", "YTA - It sucks that you don't feel appreciated, but voicing it in that way during the party itself just comes across as bitter. A good host doesn't get mad at guests who choose to leave, and your explanation of *why* they left makes it feel like you don't respect them much anyway. Being a gracious and good host requires giving guests the grace the need. Caring for pets is important, and being hungover sucks. Further, sometimes people go to things to be polite or to see family, but they shouldn't be required to stay all night if they aren't feeling it. \n\nIf you do this next year, there are some things I think you could try that might help. For one, try vocalizing your expectations ahead of time, e.g., \"dinner will be served around 6, and we really hope everyone can stay for a few hours to \\[activity\\] after dinner.\"  You can even let people know that recognition is important to you! \"I am planning on making Beef Wellington!\" It's challenging, but I've been practicing, and and I'm so excited to make it for you.\" You can also reach out to your guests ahead of time to see what kinds of restrictions they've got on their time, e.g., \"Hi sister, I was planning to host Christmas from \\[time\\]-\\[time\\]. Does that work with your schedule?\"", "Yta, when you host you can't control how people behave. Maybe they didn't feel comfortable.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking this way too personally.

I have never dreamed of saying that to any of my family members while they were still there.

It was probably your sister.  Also meeting your new gf's entire family, especially on a major holiday, can be a lot of often 2 hours is more than enough time.\n\nLastly, you decided to make beef wellington.

As a host you don\u2019t get to control how long people stay at your house just because you cooked something. They\u2019re not your hostages.

I\u2019m so glad that I won\u2019t be inviting people in the comments to my home anytime soon.\n\nYou are right. It is rude to leave before the meal is finished. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s rude to leave immediately after the meal as well if the night is relatively young. I\u2019ve had people over for dinner, the meal was done, no one had kids and these people left within 90 minutes of arriving when we have habitually hung out for 3-4 hrs. They have not been invited back. \n\nAs for the saying - if it\u2019s something your mother has said and made popular I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of turn to use that phrase.

I was pissed and refused to reschedule with them (politely) but I had to admit, I had done a lot of my own accord. No one demanded you make beef Wellington. No one had an agreement with you to stay the whole night. Considering they hosted their own party the night before? I\u2019m guessing your event wasn\u2019t their main one for the holidays. Was it polite to not stick it out for the full meal? Not really in my opinion. If they truly were there for only 2 hours, I think that was cutting it short.

The OP's mother is married; the sister brought her boyfriend.", "I think it depends on the culture. Here in Britain you pick where you are spending Christmas and that\u2019s it. I can\u2019t imagine anyone moving between events. People tend to spend it with one of the partner\u2019s families one year and the other family the next, or they see one on Christmas and the other on Boxing Day (26th Dec). Not sure where OP is but from their comments it sounds like a similar culture.", ">YTA I think it\u2019s rude to make people to sit through an hours long, multi-course meal on a holiday.\n\nWow, I sure hope nobody invites you anywhere since you find it such a chore to be there. Or at least that you decline the invitations you get.", "Depends on the country. This is how people do Xmas dinner in Britain- it is an all day event.", "Well, I feel stupid. Lol. Thank you for correcting me. Comment deleted, it's way off.", "Ah, thanks for letting me know. I must have misread it. Well, that makes it slightly less terrible, but I still think it was weird of OP's mom to be fine about it, even if it was sister's BF.", "That isnt the way it reads to me. It sounds like the guests left after being there for only 2 hours, and left after eating dinner but not staying for dessert.  It doesn't say 2 hours after dinner.", "They ate and then fucked off... Your mom from the NYC area??", "This is the second comment I\u2019ve seen from you where you claim Christmas is done in one specific way across the whole of Britain (not sure why you leave out Northern Ireland) - it isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people visit more than one family on the day and plenty who spend it at just one home. You appear to be basing the habits of over 66 million people solely on your own experience because you \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d otherwise.", "My family and friends would never make anyone endure hours long multi-course meals. All the food is prepared and put out. Have at it! You need to leave because *insert literally any reason at all*? Okay, cool! It was lovely seeing you! \n\nYou and the OP need to put on some grown up panties and learn it\u2019s okay for people to not want to sit through your ridiculous expectations. It\u2019s okay for people to leave when they want to.", "Not in any British household I\u2019ve spent Christmas it isn\u2019t.", "This:\n\n>  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect guests to stay for all 3 courses for a 3 course meal.\n\nIs not unreasonable.\n\nWhat *is* unreasonable is expecting people to wait *two hours to eat the main course on Christmas Day*. I don't care if its tradition in your household, you do not get to hold people hostage because you want to do some overly long \"tradition\". That is inconsiderate to people who already had other plans but were nice enough to stop and visit you. It isn't chewing and screwing, its people having lives outside your plans. I am sorry you went through all the trouble and labor a beef wellington requires but you cannot believe that asking people to sit for longer than you had them wait for food is in any way right. Especially when you admit both the salad *and* the soup were filling. Those could be considered meals in their own right.", "Oh come on read the nuance here. It\u2019s a family tradition. Is it really that hard to believe that while discussing how OP is hosting this year family members might mention \u201coh I hope OP learned your famous beef Wellington\u201d to OPs mom?", "Lol, I'm a little tired but I was really confused. I at first thought they had eaten dinner and then you caught them, well, doing the other thing that slang term can mean. \n\nKinda leaning towards ESH or maybe even NTA. Especially since you put so much work into the meal it would have been polite to stay through dessert (really rude to take it to go!) but the remark in front of your family wasn't great. I think everyone is reacting so badly becuase of the remark. If your family is used to it then it may have come off more as \"Damn, that was rude of them to leave before dessert!\" and not a big deal.", "No that's not why you're asking. You're asking to catch them in a 'gotcha'."]}
