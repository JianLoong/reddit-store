So in this case, YTA.", "YTA - It sucks that you don't feel appreciated, but voicing it in that way during the party itself just comes across as bitter. A good host doesn't get mad at guests who choose to leave, and your explanation of *why* they left makes it feel like you don't respect them much anyway. Being a gracious and good host requires giving guests the grace the need. Caring for pets is important, and being hungover sucks. Further, sometimes people go to things to be polite or to see family, but they shouldn't be required to stay all night if they aren't feeling it. \n\nIf you do this next year, there are some things I think you could try that might help. For one, try vocalizing your expectations ahead of time, e.g., \"dinner will be served around 6, and we really hope everyone can stay for a few hours to \\[activity\\] after dinner.\"  You can even let people know that recognition is important to you! \"I am planning on making Beef Wellington!\" It's challenging, but I've been practicing, and and I'm so excited to make it for you.\" You can also reach out to your guests ahead of time to see what kinds of restrictions they've got on their time, e.g., \"Hi sister, I was planning to host Christmas from \\[time\\]-\\[time\\]. Does that work with your schedule?\"", "Yta, when you host you can't control how people behave. Maybe they didn't feel comfortable.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking this way too personally.

I have never dreamed of saying that to any of my family members while they were still there.

I wouldn't read too much into this myself\n\nBut, frankly, if this is how you talk about your guests behind their backs, then maybe the main event, the Xmas dinner, isn't as pleasant as implied by your story.\n\nYes it's generally nice to stick around after dinner to chat. But it's more rude to dictate when your guests should leave. 2 hours is reasonable, if on the short side for a once-a-year gathering. For all you know \"I have a cat\" is code for your sister is on her period, or a family member was being tiresome and she was done with it, or <insert lots of reasons someone would want to conclude their stay at a social event>. All you know is they made an albeit false excuse and left.\n\nYTA for gossiping about your guests. Sounds like you just need to look a little more closely about how pleasant your family relationships are and whether or not they need to be injected with more joy so guests will WANT to stay longer than 2 hours, rather than making it an unspoken obligation. I hear a lot of talk about obligations (e.g. you sound unwillingly compelled to make beef Wellington) regarding this event, so maybe stop thinking of them that way, or else change the obligations.", "NTA - we hosted Thanksgiving for friends some years back and they arrived late, ate and drank themselves silly, then left; all in less than 2 hours. Since we do not have family, ever since then, we keep things small and private in our home and it truly is the best. We still make feasts for 10 people for the holidays that we end up eating out of for a week. If we feel like we need to spread some joy, we give a couple of plates of food out to our elderly neighbours.", "YTA - Maybe they left because of the things that seem to tumble out of your mouth..", "NTA, and I don't get the people who say they don't owe you to stay until the end of the meal.\n\nIf you accept an invitation, you show up, utilize your best manners, and stay until after dessert. I always offer to help clean up as well. You don't just run out with a pitiful excuse.\n\nI would not invite those people again.", "So  much to unpack here!\n\nEveryone has a different amount of social interaction \"battery\" they work with in these sorts of situations. Generally, parents with kids have even less, given the stresses of the holiday while managing kids. Additionally, quite a lot of folks have differing dietary issues - from lactose intolerance to Diabetes that make dessert rounds difficult to maneuver. Add to that body issues that can make sitting around uncomfortable and painful. \n\n2 hours of meal for a dessert course, if I'm understanding you correctly, is a hell of a long meal. \n\n\"I have to go feed the pet\" is a polite way of leaving. We used it last night. \n\nThe role of the host/ess is to make sure guests are comfortable. Their comfort level was 2 hours. Complaining about it isn't good manners on your part.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m sorry, you went to a lot of effort to host the damn family meal, it wound be nice if all your guests could be bothered to *finish* it. And maybe help , I dunno, help clear the damn table or show some appreciation.\n\nYou didn\u2019t have to host. You didn\u2019t have to create an elaborate meal. You didn\u2019t have to make an effort to get your family together for the holiday. Nope. But you *did*, and it would be nice to be appreciated. \n\nYou didn\u2019t even mention that there was family tension or a weird uncle or arguments about politics, or family pressure about when sisters plans to add to the family, all hot button topics. \n\nMy god, it\u2019s not like your sister had to split time with you and her BF\u2019s elderly grandmothers meal on the same night. She said she has a *cat*. *I* have a cat, and ya know what, cats can be left to their own devices for more than a couple of hours.

It was probably your sister.  Also meeting your new gf's entire family, especially on a major holiday, can be a lot of often 2 hours is more than enough time.\n\nLastly, you decided to make beef wellington. You can't put expectations on your guests based on the difficulty of the dish that YOU CHOSE TO MAKE. People don't have to stay longer just because you worked harder.", "YTA. As a host you don\u2019t get to control how long people stay at your house just because you cooked something. They\u2019re not your hostages.

I\u2019m so glad that I won\u2019t be inviting people in the comments to my home anytime soon.\n\nYou are right. It is rude to leave before the meal is finished. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s rude to leave immediately after the meal as well if the night is relatively young. I\u2019ve had people over for dinner, the meal was done, no one had kids and these people left within 90 minutes of arriving when we have habitually hung out for 3-4 hrs. They have not been invited back. \n\nAs for the saying - if it\u2019s something your mother has said and made popular I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of turn to use that phrase.

Get over yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou now know where you stand with those family members. Next year should be less stressful without them", "Does it mean eat and screw the host over? Because they come and eat and contribute to mess and then leave without helping? \nBecause that is definitely frustrating. The connotation of the phrase is really vulgar.\n\nYou should have been more tactful in front of your aunt and uncle.\n\nThey did make the effort to come over and if you didn't communicate your expectations of how long they stay, that's on you. \n\nI'd say YTA because you are making it about you and being needy. Hosting isn't about you.", "NTA for being upset. If people agree to be somewhere for Christmas dinner, you stay there the entire time. Regardless of what the menu is, the hosts go through a lot of time and money preparing. It's rude to leave early unless it's said beforehand. Chew and screw is pretty funny.

I spent 2 days prepping for a dinner guest once in addition to shopping for ingredients around town. It was a big deal to me and I went all out. The dinner was so unimportant to my guest that they forgot they\u2019d asked me to host them and didn\u2019t show up. I was pissed and refused to reschedule with them (politely) but I had to admit, I had done a lot of my own accord. No one demanded you make beef Wellington. No one had an agreement with you to stay the whole night. Considering they hosted their own party the night before? I\u2019m guessing your event wasn\u2019t their main one for the holidays. Was it polite to not stick it out for the full meal? Not really in my opinion. If they truly were there for only 2 hours, I think that was cutting it short.

I did a first course of soup and antipasto salad, then put the main in and that was served about an hour after.", "Nowhere did I say or imply that I couldn\u2019t have used other words to describe the situation. This is a very common phrase in my region and used in my family. The phrase just means to eat and leave quickly. My mom herself  uses this phrase all the time lol, she was not upset about the verbiage she was upset that I said anything about thinking it was rude that they left early. Which is kind of ironic too because my mom used to host and would call you out right in front of everybody if you even thought of leaving before desert was served.", "We planned this in line with the exact same timing that our family holiday dinners have always had. The first course was antipasto salad which is loaded with meat and cheese and a hefty potato soup. Nobody would have been hungry enough to eat the main right after. We also thought people would want to spend some time together instead of trying to get through the meal as quickly as possible to leave. If we knew that was the case we wouldn\u2019t have hosted.", "She had said I should make it because the rest of the family was wanting to keep the Wellington tradition alive.", "My mom has done the Wellington tradition for years. She is disabled and her health has degraded to where she can no longer do it anymore. She had told me that she along with the rest of the family really wanted the tradition to continue. She made it sound like everybody wanted the tradition to go on.", "What are you even talking about? This is nothing to do with praise, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect guests to stay for all 3 courses for a 3 course meal.", "No, but staying for the entirety of the meals courses would have been appreciated and I did expect that. I guess I went wrong with expecting it.", "No I think her reaction wasn\u2019t because of the verbiage, I think it was because I was critical of them in front of my aunt and uncle.", "My mom had facilitated a group conversation with everybody before I was even the new host. Everybody had said they wanted to find a way for the tradition to continue.", "Yes the wait between courses is common and expected in my culture. I have never heard of anybody eating everything back to back immediately.", "My mom has hosted Christmas dinner every other year, this was the first year I did it. It\u2019s what she made every year and it\u2019s what everybody always requests. She did tell me what everybody was wanting the Wellington tradition to continue", "A vast majority of the prep work for a Wellington is done in advance of the guests arriving, so the complexity of it really didn\u2019t affect the timing of the courses. First course was served a half hour after guests arrived, the main was served another hour after that and desert about another hour after the main when guests are hungry enough for it. That timing would have been similar regardless of what the main course was. My family has always done and expects 3 course holiday meals.", "She wasn\u2019t mad that I used that specific verbiage, she was mad that I mentioned something they did was rude. She has used this very same verbiage in front of extended family numerous times when she had hosted.\n\nAnd she would use it in context like \u201cnobody chew and screw\u201d when she hosted at her house. She was the one who instilled in us that it is rude to leave before dinner courses are complete. She set that tone.", "Why do you think low class means boorish and uncultured though? It's because people think that people of a lower socioeconomic class are uncultured lmao, it's not a term that exists within it's own meaning - by calling someone low class you're literally saying \"you're acting like a poor by saying that\".", "That sheds an entirely different light on what happened. You should edit your post to notate that your mother is the one who popularized the saying in the family.", "Good lord. Why wait until eating salads are done to START cooking the main?! I would expect the salad/soup to leave the table and then the main to be served within minutes, not a whole hour later. \n\nI don't want to sit in a dining chair for hours to wait while a beef wellington cooks. They were completely reasonable to leave after they waited so long for the main. And maybe they were full and didn't want to eat dessert then. It isn't nice to police what and how much people eat. \n\nAnd the phrase was absolutely vulgar and uncalled for.", "You asked for an opinion. You got one. If you don't want to listen to it. Don't.  Doesn't change anything in my life. \n\nDo you want me to just say you are right?   Sure, OK. You are right. \n\nEnjoy your day bring upset at them.", "It's still not guests requesting it's your mom.", "So no. Your sister nor her BF specifically asked you to make the Wellington. You just took your moms preference as law.", "They waited two hours! Seriously, you aren\u2019t entitled to anyones time, and just because someone doesn\u2019t prioritize your thing over everything else in their lives doesn\u2019t give you the right to denigrate them.", "Was the last course ready when they left? I'm not being obtuse. I don't really like sweets and I wouldn't want to wait around for dessert.", "It\u2019s not the expectation where you went wrong. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t keep your thoughts to yourself. How is that not clear?", "Americans do, I was confused the first time I went to a multi course dinner at my friend's house (he was French) & there were long breaks between, but I like it more.", ">She did tell me what everybody was wanting the Wellington tradition to continue\n\nDid everyone (or anyone) else tell you that directly?", "You didn't start the main in the oven until the salads were eaten, you said. That's ridiculous. \n\nMy family eats 3 course meals as well, but the main is ready when the salads are finished, not a whole hour later. Yours wasnt even in the oven!", "Here is the thing.  Your mom is being rude, and you've picked that up from her without realizing she's being rude.  It's not just the phrase; it's constantly, at multiple dinners, giving people orders about how long to stay.  Putting social pressure on your guests, in front of the other guests, is uncouth and will leave an unpleasant taste.\n\nMaking dinner for people, no matter how fancy the meal is, does not require those people to stay long enough to satisfy you.  Two hours is reasonable, if a bit skimpy, for a Christmas visit.  If they left before dessert, does that mean supper wasn't on time?  \n\nYou don't know why your sister and boyfriend needed to leave.  You're taking it as an insult, but it could just as well be related to things in their personal lives that you don't know.   If your entire family decamped two hours after arriving, you may need to rethink the way you entertain. This is a signal to you that they aren't enjoying themselves.\n\nYTA, and please break your mother's habits; they're rude.", "I did edit.", "This is the pacing that holiday dinners have always been done in my family. Each course is pretty hearty so it would be a lot to eat back to back. Nobody was forced to sit in a dining table bored for hours. We have a hot tub that everybody was told to bring bathing suits if they would like to use, we had a nice fire going outside, we have a home theater that was open for anybody to put whatever they want on, we had games out. We really tried to make it a fun day for everybody.", "I was simply just adding some more context.", "who spat in your coffee this morning lol", "I don\u2019t understand. How is everybody telling my mom they want the Wellington tradition to be kept alive not them requesting Wellington?", "This is what I came here to say, I would be so happy that they took time to show up to my dinner, even if they didn\u2019t stay the entire time, people don\u2019t owe you anything, they didn\u2019t even have to show up at all.", "I was asked my opinion I didn\u2019t just go out and say anything unprompted.", "They were asked their opinion. She said it was rude of him to eat and bail. What should she have done?", "The salads were hearty antipasto salad loaded with meat and cheese. The soup was a hearty potato soup. That\u2019s a filling course to have the main right after people wouldn\u2019t have been hungry enough to even eat it at that time. Our timing and pacing was exactly in line with what our family has done every single year. The point of the holiday is to get together and spend time together, not to eat and leave as quickly as possible.", "Supper was served on time. We had guests arrive at 3:00, first course at 3:30 and the main an hour after. It is our culture that there is a break between courses and that they don\u2019t come out one after the other. I did not realize that this is bizarre to some cultures. I am learning that it is rude to expect people to stay for all courses.", "And the bf isn't from your family. He likely found it ridiculous like I do.\n\nI would find it extremely weird to eat a salad, get up from the table and go hot tubbing, get redressed, and eat a main. Odd.", "Your comment was absolutely uncalled for. It was rude. They spent well over 2 hours with you. Their lives can't be centred around yours. They made the effort to come, that's what counts.\n\nWhat you made was a fool of yourself in front of everyone with that comment.", "It's called triangulation. Did anyone else tell you that? Why would they tell mom but not the host?", "Did everyone tell your mom that? I know how moms operate", "You were asked about the boyfriend and then proceeded to complain in front of other guests about both your sister and the boyfriend being rude. Kinda seems like you added more there because you were in your feelings.", "She could have stopped at \u201che seemed like a very nice guy.\u201d She chose to add in the part about the rudeness in front of other guests.\n\nWho probably wanted to leave too but OP\u2019s feelings would be hurt even more.", "Honestly, it sounds exhausting and like you choose to make way too much food - you want a single meal to be a whole day affair. I'm on bf's side and definitely would have been looking for an escape from a 3-4 hour drawn out meal. \n\nEnjoying each other's company is important- and they did that. They just opted out of hours 4+, which is entirely reasonable. Especially when you have a guest not used to your traditions. Instead of understanding, you were very vulgar and insulting.", "So you want people to waste those Christmas Day, waiting on you to serve them food. A meal served in courses is not served hours apart.", "No, it's rude to scold your guests about the time they leave.  That's the rudeness here.", "The main went out 90 mins after arrival.....I don't think that is on time.", "It has been the same pacing forever in our family, this was nothing new. Also the word salad is really downplaying how hearty the first course was.", "I guess I had heard the phrase \u201cchew and screw\u201d so often in my family that it got normalized to me and I didn\u2019t realize how vulgar it would be to others. I am glad you folks brought it to my attention and I am not going to use the phrase/comment anymore.", "Because I wasn\u2019t the new host at the time. My mom had told everyone her health was too poor to continue the tradition, and asked the whole family if everybody would like to find a way to continue the tradition; everybody said yes. And at that point I became the new host.", "Their mother isn't yours? Some people trust their parents, especially when they know it's a family tradition and most people would be expecting it.\n\nMy mom makes potato salad every get together, if there was no potato salad it would be noticeable and people complain.\n\n Is that a direct, notarized request? No, but it is definitely a requested dish whether everybody makes sure to tell her or not.", "she was asked about the boyfriend and shared one of his actions that impacted her opinion..", "All I tried to do was pick up the tradition that my disabled mother can no longer do.", "If they think spending time with family while somebody else does all the work and takes on all the expense is a waste of their Christmas Day they are more than welcome to not attend. It would be less work and expense for the host. In our culture, yes meals in courses are indeed served hours apart for holidays.", "it is for a lot of families. for me, we all arrive at least an hour before the main meal is served to mingle and have appetizers.", "Speaking somebody outside your culture, if I had an antipasto salad, potato soup, and beef wellington with sides, I wouldn't have *room* for dessert.  I understand that your culture is different from mine.  I'm trying to give you an outside perspective.", "Again, he is a guest not from your family. Just because you've done it forever doesn't mean he knows that or is used to it! Or that he wants to participate for that long.", "I'm just asking. I don't know her, which is why I'm asking.", "It wasn\u2019t just his action though. He left with OP\u2019s sister for HER cat. If it bothered her that much, maybe be the adult and talk to her sister about it. \n\nOP thinks it\u2019s rude for people to leave early but not rude to talk about them to other people after they leave.", "We've been pretty forceful (and I'm one of them, I'm sorry) about your perspective.\n\nYou had two goals here:  you wanted to make the supper that your family is accustomed to, has had for years.  Second, you wanted your guests to stay for hours, eating that supper slowly.\n\nThat's your family tradition, and I get that.  But to people not from your culture, including your mom's boyfriend and your sister-in-law,  that is a big ask.  It's a very heavy supper -- you said yourself that the salad and soup were filling -- and some of your guests are going to be full before the dessert is even on the table.  \n\nThat is also a valid perspective.", "What culture is this? That would provide a lot of context for the viewers. Additionally, how long after the main course was dessert expected to occur?", "If he (or anybody for that matter) found it ridiculous or didn\u2019t want to participate I don\u2019t know why they wouldn\u2019t have just declined the invite?", "there\u2019s no reason to assume that OP didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t intend to share that she was bothered by them leaving to her sister. the sister\u2019s cat isn\u2019t really important here\u2014 cats can be left alone for quite some time. given that OP is continuing a family tradition of which the sister knows the expectations, the cat having been alone for a couple hours sounds like an excuse. if the cat isn\u2019t new and the boyfriend is, it possibly isn\u2019t about the cat at all. \n\nalso since when is it rude to talk to family members about their impression of another\u2019s new partner? is it not appropriate to compare first impressions of a new person introduced to the group?", "My mom\u2019s boyfriend and sister in law are both from my culture."]}
