My sister (F32) attended the wedding, and there was no bad blood or arguments whatsoever. She got slightly drunk, but nothing too disruptive. She has been with her fiance (M48) for 8 months, and I am not entirely supportive, but I held my silence during the ceremony and was entirely respectful of the situation. Another detail - she had decided it was to be an alcohol-free wedding, and I didn't complain to her face, but after my father and I both brought it up, we decided we would sneakily pack a few cans of beer for just us to share. My sister was a wild drinker and party animal for ages, and it was a huge part of her 'fun' personality, but since she met Steve she had stopped drinking altogether and become much more shut off. Anyways, after the ceremony had ended, I went to the reception and began drinking a few beers, nothing too much. My sister immediately came over to me, ditching her new husband and confronted me, in front of our family, his family and all the guests there. \n\nShe screamed that I was disrespectful of the rules she had set and that I had never been supportive of her relationship. I was slightly intoxicated by this point, and all the words I had been holding in slipped out. I told her that I never told her I didn't support her, but now she mentioned it, I wanted to make my opinions clear, and I hated Steve because months ago she would have laughed at the idea of an alcohol-free wedding, and she was so much brighter back then. I told her that Steve was an awful match for her and that I couldn't stay and watch this continue. She was sobbing by this point and told me to leave then, and I immediately did so. That night and the next morning I had tons of messages from family, some supporting me and some saying I was terrible for ruining my sister's wedding to support my alcoholism. I wouldn't have said anything otherwise but her outburst prompted mine and I'm not sure if I regret my decision or not.

I\u2019m the first to agree that dry weddings are not very fun (imo), BUT you are there to celebrate the couple not party like you are at a bar or club. If you can\u2019t go a few hours without a drink out of respect for the couple and their wishes, you should have not attended in the first place. At the ABSOLUTE VERY least you should have been DISCREET about having a few drinks (and only in moderation) and not thrown it in their face in front of everyone. How hard would it have been to excuse yourself to a private place if you haaadddd to drink so badly? \n\nAlso, while your feelings about her relationship may very well be valid, unfortunately you missed the boat on when it would have been APPROPRIATE to voice those thoughts and feelings. Alllllll of this should have been said well in advance of the wedding. What good did you expect to come of voicing any of that AFTER she had walked down the aisle?!!

It seems like you don't know why it was alcohol free. Perhaps someone close to the groom is an alcoholic? Perhaps your sister and her partner can't afford a bar? Either way it was their wedding and being alcohol free isn't a request that should be hard for you to accommodate. If it is I'd reconsider my drinking habits.\n\nThe third reason is because a few cans of beer, that you were going to share, is enough to get you drunk enough to spout all the shit you were keeping back. If you didn't want to ruin her big day I'd have left the cans at home.\n\nThe second reason you sound like an asshole is it sounds like your sister is in a steadier place now. Just because she's not being wild and a party animal doesn't mean she's unhappy. It could just mean she's settling down. 8 months might seem like a short time but that doesn't mean that they're badly matched.\n\nFrom start to finish your behavior has been appalling. \n\nFinally if witnesses to this are calling you an alcoholic you might want to consider that you could be.
