However, if you are serious about each other, and bond over DND like you say you do, being in a campaign together could really help strengthen that relationship. If you are already sensitive to bias\u2019s you\u2019ll know not to bring that to the campaign anyways, trust yourself.

But also, the fact that you\u2019re worried about it suggests you won\u2019t be the kind of DM that does that pulls favors.", "NTA. You offered a fair compromise and your fears are not unfounded. A lot of DMs tend to favor the player they are dating, whether they notice it or not, and it can make the game unenjoyable for the other players.", "NTA: Ethics are important. You want to keep your game fair.", "On one hand, a game is about spending time with people you enjoy spending time with. One the other, its about the group not an individual. Im going NAH especially given your respective youth. Maybe join a different campaign together where neither of you is DM. Idk i dont dnd", "NTA You want to run an ethical game. I appreciate your caution.", "NTA, this is absolutely a thing that happens and if you want to set that boundary, you are in the right to do so. If someone else wants to DM a campaign where you both play, maybe thats a compromise. However, it might be helpful to explain to your BF what you see, why you are uncomfortable with it, and that you two can still find other nerdy activities to enjoy.", "NTA - I applaud your awareness of there often being bias when couples play and one is the DM.

We play in the same group and have since dating years ago. You're making the game more important than the relationship. This isn't about ethics, if you're afraid of bias, be aware of it going into the situation, and you will not face it when you're in it. A number of dating couples and married couples successfully play together and DM one another without problems. It all comes down to the maturity of the DM. This is a game with friends so you're supposed to play with your friends. So is he your friend as well as your boyfriend or not?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We love to talk about Dnd and watch other geeky things together.

However...from experience I would say only trying out will show you if you can play together and separate the relationship or not. \n\nMy husband and I play together for decades without issues and I know other couples that have no problems as well. But I have also experienced campaigns that went south fast once a bf/gf was introduced and relationship mechanics seeped into it and caused drama. \n\nIn the end the most important part is that you treat it as a game and the actions of characters and DM as a role you play and not as the actions and thoughts of your bf/gf. If you can handle that, then the rest should ge easy. Good luck!", "NTA you stated your feelings and your decision, which is based on your experience and leans careful and respectful of others. It's not your responsibility to manage your bf's response to your boundaries. You even tried to find a middle ground to accommodate his little baby tantrum and he's still pouting. Even if your request WAS unreasonable or ridiculous to him, it wouldn't matter bc he should still respect that those are your feelings. \n\nHe needs to back off, grow up, and \\*\\*stop trying to make a woman do something she doesn't want to\\*\\* (think about this red flag and if this is a pattern)", "NTA. If you have an established campaign, bringing in your partner could make things weird for a lot of reasons. Especially since you me tinned you haven't been together that long. Imagine how messy it could be to bring him in, he becomes an established part of the campaign, and then you guys break up or something. \n\nDoing a one shot or even a different DnD game/group with him seems like a better way to play together. At least until you guys have played together for a while.", "Did you ask him before you started the campaign? How long have you been together? I feel like there's a whole relationship dynamic we're missing out on.", "NTA - you have provided a super reasonable compromise to a possibly challenging situation.", "Nta I love dnd and have even run a few games myself, and no I would not gm for my husband.... He's to foolish with his characters and I don't trust myself to bring the hammer down when he does stupid things like charge into cannon fire.... Again. So no it's a good boundary to have for your table, I mean if someone else was running the game that's a different story, super fun to play on a team with my husband. Join a game together yes, have him join the game you run... No. Also I would not want to have my husband be my gm.... Because I would also probably take it personally when I do stupid things.... Like call a black dragon an ugly MF to give NPCs time to run away, because now it's going to attack me instead. You have to be able to be impartial because you will be doing stupid things", "NTA. Also if he's in your campaign, you can't talk about your plans for the campaign! Maybe if you frame it as wanting him as a sounding board for ideas, it might go over easier? Either way, a DM is never obligated to add a player if they don't want to. I think offering a one-shot is a good compromise.", "NTA, I think you\u2019re being very mature and fair by expecting this potential issue and wanting to be sure you avoid it. I think running a one shot with him before having him in your campaign is a great idea. Especially if the campaign is ongoing or about ready to start and other people aren\u2019t expecting him to join, I think you\u2019re being responsible by not wanting to involve a different dynamic that people weren\u2019t signed up for. My last DND campaign ended because there were 2 couples in the group and both broke up in the same time period. It happens, but we knew we were starting a campaign with couples in it.\n  \nThat said, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for being upset, he wants to do this thing you like together, and campaigns are fun and he wants to be involved. That\u2019s completely fair. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok for him to say you\u2019re being unreasonable or to disrespect the boundary you\u2019re setting. But I would need more details to really comment on his behavior here. \n  \nIf you guys agree to the one shot and resolve this, I do think generally you should put some effort into trying to be a fair DM to a partner (this one or later). Just to see if that\u2019s something you can do. But if you feel like that\u2019s a relationship boundary you need to have, that\u2019s allowed! There are plenty of reasons it would take a lot of work to be unbiased and it\u2019s very mature to be able to recognize that and do something about it.", "NTA\n\nBias, or perception of bias, has an incredibly high chance of happening - either for the partner, or in an effort to try to avoid that - *against* the partner.\n\nAnd all of that is on top of assuming the partner doesn't expect favourable consideration.\n\nExperienced role players, who are in a well-established relationship (and ideally with some history of roleplaying as players together for some time) can obviate this, but even then not necessarily.\n\nTread the safe path, and just keep with 'no'.", "I was married to my DM and I made it very clear up front, with a mutual friend as a witness, that if I caught him treating me any different that I'd not only quit that group but our other 2 groups.  He never did as far as we could tell.so great boundary setting and I hope that he comes around to understand why you set it.", "NTA, but sit down and have a conversation with your boyfriend about this. Discuss with him your worries about showing favoritism and explain to him if you do allow him to join that you're going to have to treat him like any other player in your campaign.\n\nI myself am currently in a campaign with co-DMs, my husband is one and our roommate who is my boss is the other. When we first started playing they told everyone at the table no favoritism would be shown to anyone and they've kept their word. This is how it's got to be in these situations because if you can't separate the different aspects of the relationship, then the game is end with the rest of the party feeling disgruntled.", "Basically, you\u2019ve got a dungeon master (dm) whose in charge of managing the campaign (or coming up with/building the campaign/narrative and everything else), they\u2019re the ones who check the rolls and manage the actions of non-player characters, etc.\n\nThe players the move their character through the campaign. Think of it as a cooperative board game.\n\n\nDMing for a group is a lot of work and there needs to be a lot of communication about expectations- are they expecting a fluff campaign that has no risk? Are they expecting a killer DM? \n\nA campaign that takes a single session and tossing the character away, Or is it something much more involved with a home brewed mega-campaign with story-arc campaigns that themselves take months? \n\nIts not like watching football, you can\u2019t just show up with a case of beer and everybody is happy to have you.\n\n\nBringing in a new player changes everything, from the dynamic of the group to expectations of how players are to have their characters behave and how strict the consequences are for being a murder hobo\u2026 and the biases by The DM whose job it is to make everything \u2018fair\u2019 and challenging absolutely have caused groups to split.", "The idea was for it to be a trial essentially.", "While I agree that many couples can be successful in a campaign together. He and I simply haven\u2019t been together that long.", "It is about the maturity of the DM, and the DM is a literal teenager who is being very mature by foreseeing this problem and wanting to test out playing with their bf before throwing him into their (possibly already ongoing?) campaign", "My roommates are into D&D, murderhobo style", "Perfectly reasonable then. Your BF is just butthurt.", "Fair enough", "That's fair", "NAH. \n\nI've been playing DnD for 20+ years and have seen and done all the things you said and fear. Seen great games destroyed because the DM brought their partner in, or players broke up mid campaign, all manner of interpersonal issues can ruin the fragile perfection of a great game. \n\nTesting the waters with a one shot is completely reasonable. Your boyfriend wants to be involved so badly and is getting FOMO, but needs to understand that he needs to respect your position and compromise also. \n\nPerhaps ask him to run a one shot with you as a player, and see how it goes. You're under no obligation to involve him and remember that your players all get a say as well, it's their game too.", "NTA, I haven't played D&D in ages (although trying to get back into it), but group dynamic is very important.  \nI do play lots of board games with my friends, Decent, Gloomhaven, Pandemic, Catan and so much more. I've see friends of friends nearly come to blows over choices being made. Being cautious and wanting to do a few trial runs is an awesome idea. My exgf and I couldn't play verses games as she got upset if she started to lose. It was more fun if we did co-op.", "Ugh, I've never played dnd but I've played other coop rpg video games(divinity 2) with couples,  and it's not fun, it becomes less about the overall sentiment, and more about the majority opinion being skewed due to the couple operating together. Also, never finished that playthrough. The gf got bored, and that was it.", "NTA, because he called you unreasonable. \n\nBut if you're worried you're going to be biased in favor of him... Just don't be? You are the one in control there, lol.", "I had a DnD group where the DM's spouse joined. The spouse's character was always some overpowered homebrew class and he would change characters constantly. In the end, the whole group broke up.  \n  \nI don't think that's how it has to go down, if both the DM and the partner are able to be cool. But I also get why OP is nervous about it.  \n  \nDnD groups are like rainforests. Sometimes you change one thing-- like adding a new person-- and everything dies.", "Clearly NTA. Table chemistry is probably the most important thing in DND and a trial one shot is entirely reasonable."]}
