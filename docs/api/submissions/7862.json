She confronted me about it and we had a very long talk where she admitted that when I'm away her mom doesn't treat her well, and often puts her cousins/my nephews above her, telling her she should be understanding we're far better off then them. I was aware that they would occasionally sneak into her room to take things or play but apparently they go so far as to wait for her to leave for a few minutes, run in and grab what they want. Her mom also makes a lot of comments about her weight. For reference our daughter takes after me being taller with some more masculine features such as broader shoulders while my wife is small and petit. There's many other things I won't say here that my wife has said to our daughter.\n\nI didn't bring it up at first and consulted my wife on buying a lock for our daughters door which she opposed, even if our daughter said she'd buy it with her own money. She started yelling about how under \"Her\" roof our daughter has to abide by her rules. The house is technically mine, not hers. She stormed off and immediately began telling all our friends and her sister and BIL that I was being controlling and awful to her.\n\nThe BIL found the first post and sent it to her, leading to another argument where she accused me of airing our dirty laundry to the world instead of trying to communicate despite me trying to and getting shut down. Once she stormed off I packed a bag, as did my daughter, and we went to a hotel. (Yes we brought the snack bin) Where we have been the past few days while I find a good divorce lawyer. My wife is still spreading lies about me, claiming I tried to kick her out, and all sorts of other lies. I'm finished with her, I don't care what she says I'll be divorcing her and paying as much alimony as she wants so that I can keep my daughter safe from her. I don't care about the house, or anything else, she can keep it all and let her sister, BIL and nephews mooch off her until she's penniless.\n\nI'm sorry this is not a happy update and I doubt I will make one after this.

Your daughter is safe while she\u2019s with you.

Wife needs counseling/therapy to figure out why she's being so evil to her own daughter.", "Well done you, but don't make it easy for her with the divorce, your daughter and you still need a place to live and who cares what her family thinks. The house is yours and is probably worth a lot, she can go and live with her family and see how she is treated. Your daughter should also go NC.", "Your daughter must be thankful. May she have a peaceful life after having such a bad mother. But do get a shark lawyer. And is the house in your name?", "I am sorry for the upheaval in your life, but you are a SUPER DAD!\n\nGreat job ensuring your daughter is protected.\n\nSeriously though, don't let the soon to be ex get anything if you can stop it.  The house was your daughter's home.  Let your ex go live with her sister and family.", "Bruh you need to fight for your house and as little alimony as possible.

You're in a much better position than your soon to be ex wife. She can't hold custody over you because your daughter is 17 and allowed to pick. That's your house that you'll need to house your daughter in so fight for it. \n\nDocument everything, take your daughter to a therapist and have them document everything and ask if they'd be willing to give a statement. Screenshot every social media post where your ex spreads lies and only communicate with her through text or email so you can have written evidence. \n\nFight because most judges will laugh her out of court with the evidence and your daughters testimony. Talk to a divorce lawyer asap and follow their directions and fight for every last thing you and your daughter are entitled to.", "NTA :)", "You are the hero of everyone here with a bad mum!

You are a hero to your daughter and seeing that you brought the snack bin made me so happy (and I\u2019m sure her too of course). Let your wife lie, forget her, she doesn\u2019t deserve you or your daughter.\n\nEdit: My dad is a horrible narcissist who worked from home and made my life unbearable. I used to beg my mom to divorce him even when I was as young as 8 years old. She would enable him with complete passivity. Today I struggle with dissociative and anxiety disorders. You are protecting your daughter and I cannot praise you enough for that.", "sorry that this is not exactly the outcome you wished for, but I wouldn't say it is not a happy one: you stood your ground and are doing what's best for your daughter.

I know a few people who are similar to your wife in the sense that out of unconditional love for some relatives, they end up resenting and putting down others who are actually closer to them.\n\nYour daughter is very fortunate to have you as her father. I hope you both find peace and happiness.", "> \u201cI don't care about the house, or anything else, she can keep it all and let her sister, BIL and nephews mooch off her until she's penniless.\u201d\n\nNope.  You are supposed to be a role model.  If you don\u2019t contend for an equitable settlement, you are teaching your daughter the *exact same lesson as her mother*: \u201cjust give people everything they want to keep the peace\u201d.  You and your daughter need the house and everything else.  Be strong but fair.", "NTA, You can always do like a friend did. Give her the house instead of alimony. At least there's an end to what she gets. They walk away happy and free cheaper in the long run. Check your credit and lock it down. So, no new debts appear.", "If I remember right from your first post, the house is yours. Don't give it to her. Your daughter shouldn't have to uproot her life for your soon-to-be ex.\n\nAnd congratulations to you for standing up for your daughter!", "While it's not a happy update, and I'm sorry for all of what you are going through, I applaud you for standing up for your daughter.

Good luck to you both. \u2764", "Do not let her have the house. You need it for your daughter. Especially if it's yours and was yours before getting together.

Give her what she is legally entitled but don't walk away, that won't help your daughter", "Glad you are taking care of your daughter and protecting her from her mother. \n\nDon't give your Soon-to-be-Ex everything she wants.  You have a daughter to support who deserves it.  Your S2B-Ex can get a job and support herself and her mooching family in their own home.", "> But don't give up without a fight\n\nListen to this, OP. It's your house; it's _your daughter's_ house. Your wife doesn't deserve to take it away from you two. Fight for it.", "This!", "The daughter is 17 and will almost certainly chose to only stay with dad, my guess is the wife will be the one paying child support, if the daughter is even a minor much longer.", "I doubt the mom will even get custody, the daughter is 17 and a lot of places allow children of a certain age to choose their custodial situation.", "Definitely\n\nWhen I read the original post, I thought they already were divorced. (Don't know why I read it that way.) I, too, and sorry to see the marriage end, but it sounds like it's for the best", "He left the house for a hotel though, that's really gonna complicate it. It shouldn't, but unfortunately it will.", "My thinking too. Great dad and all. But the way I understand it if you leave the house you're signalling you don't want it, legally.", "Exactly!  Don\u2019t reward your wife\u2019s bad behavior.", "Absolutely this. This is the update on the way to the good ending. All the best to OP and their daughter.", "A lot of places allow teens to pick their custodial situation, or at least take heavy input from the teen themselves. It's highly unlikely that OP will be paying any alimony and it might honestly go the reverse.", " I wish you both happiness and health.", "In some states, CS can extend all the way up until ~~25~~ 21.  Get that child support OP!", "Maybe he can say that he left to remove himself and his daughter from an unsafe situation (which technically it was).\n\nI think that may even push sole custody for him even more.", "Not really. If the house was in his name before the marriage then most places see it a premarital property and thus solely his and eventually his daughter should he pass.", "Which states? That is wild!!", "For custody, yes. But unfortunately not the house. If the divorce lawyer she gets is even a little competent, that house will be hers now.", "True, I do hope the house was already his before the marriage. Guess I shouldn't have just assumed it wasn't.", "Looks like Indiana, Mississippi, New York, and Washington D.C. all require child support until the age of 21."]}
