She confronted me about it and we had a very long talk where she admitted that when I'm away her mom doesn't treat her well, and often puts her cousins/my nephews above her, telling her she should be understanding we're far better off then them. I was aware that they would occasionally sneak into her room to take things or play but apparently they go so far as to wait for her to leave for a few minutes, run in and grab what they want. Her mom also makes a lot of comments about her weight. For reference our daughter takes after me being taller with some more masculine features such as broader shoulders while my wife is small and petit. There's many other things I won't say here that my wife has said to our daughter.\n\nI didn't bring it up at first and consulted my wife on buying a lock for our daughters door which she opposed, even if our daughter said she'd buy it with her own money. She started yelling about how under \"Her\" roof our daughter has to abide by her rules. The house is technically mine, not hers. She stormed off and immediately began telling all our friends and her sister and BIL that I was being controlling and awful to her.\n\nThe BIL found the first post and sent it to her, leading to another argument where she accused me of airing our dirty laundry to the world instead of trying to communicate despite me trying to and getting shut down. Once she stormed off I packed a bag, as did my daughter, and we went to a hotel. (Yes we brought the snack bin) Where we have been the past few days while I find a good divorce lawyer. My wife is still spreading lies about me, claiming I tried to kick her out, and all sorts of other lies. I'm finished with her, I don't care what she says I'll be divorcing her and paying as much alimony as she wants so that I can keep my daughter safe from her. I don't care about the house, or anything else, she can keep it all and let her sister, BIL and nephews mooch off her until she's penniless.\n\nI'm sorry this is not a happy update and I doubt I will make one after this.

You are protecting your daughter from abusive family members!\n\nJust a tip though, don't go crazy letting wife \"have everything\" before you talk to your lawyer. Your daughter is well old enough that she should be able to choose who she stays with, and the ongoing abuse should only help cement it. Meanwhile, anything you let your ex have is, in a way, giving away what is due your daughter for her uncle to, as you say, leech away. You said the house is in your name, that's a large asset worth of future funds that may be needed for your healthcare, or your daughter's, or her education, or just for part of her inheritance when you pass. Also on that note also talk to your lawyer about when to redo your will to remove your ex, and make sure any powers of attorney or anything else are revoked. Any bank accounts that are yours only, make sure passwords are secure, any that are joint, save records of the balance in case she drains them, and ask your lawyer what the best course of action is with them going forward. To avoid fights you can insist everything go through your lawyer, and block her everywhere (or better yet, mute/filter her so you have evidence of any further abuse, etc if needed).", "Your post made me tear up.
