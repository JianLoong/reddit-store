The instructions were to keep the bandage on for 24 hrs and not lift ANYTHING for two weeks to a month, else I may bust my stitches.\n\nI asked my kids for help around the house and they both said they were too busy. One (19f) going out of town and the other (23f) said she had a project to do, (she\u2019s learning a new skill so she can get a better job.) I\u2019m happy the one is getting to have some fun, and the other I\u2019m proud she\u2019s improving her life. But seriously, this sucks. I can\u2019t afford hiring someone to help out.\n\n\nSo I asked a man on our second date to go grocery shopping, so I could feed the cat and get milk. Thank god, he was nice and didn\u2019t mind my messy-ish house. \n\n(I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be incapacitated like this or I would have planned better.)\n\nThe next day when I changed my bandage, the wound was bigger than I expected and the ones that I bought were too small. I tried to use one, but it laid on top of my stitches. The pain was terrible, but I didn\u2019t have anything else and it\u2019s on my shoulder blade, so it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get to.\n\nI needed help. I contacted my friends but they were all busy. So I reached out to my daughter who said she was studying a new skill, and I explained that I was desperate for help. I couldn\u2019t see my back, I didn\u2019t sleep much because every time I rolled over, I woke from the pain. She said she could, but not until 10 or 11 pm that night, and she had another thing in an hour.\n\nI called her, I thought I could pick her up quickly, run to the store, and get her back home for her thing. If she was late, I figured people would forgive her because she was helping her mom. She started crying because I was giving her a guilt trip and she needed to breath, exasperated I hung up.\n\nI ended up going to the pharmacy, and the nice pharmacist helped and put it on my back\u2026 in the store, where anyone could see. It was weird asking a stranger and being exposed in public, but she was kind, and said I could come back again to put on the bandaid the next day.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t know it would be so easy. I did feel terrible that my daughter cried, and sent a text apology which she hasn\u2019t responded to.\n\nBut I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t often ask for help. I ALWAYS bend over backwards, spend time and money (that I don\u2019t have,) do whatever I can for my kids\u2026 but this hurt a lot because I really wanted her to help me verses a stranger.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think and am going around and around in my head. \n\nI\u2019ve never wanted to emotional manipulate my children, I don\u2019t even point out my hardships or how I\u2019ve sacrificed for them, but I LEGIT needed help, was alone, sleep deprived and in pain\u2026 also hungry\u2026 but that\u2019s another story.\n\nAITA?

You\u2019ve taught them that you don\u2019t need their help by diminishing any suffering you\u2019ve undergone for years.

She told you she could help but you'd have to wait because she was busy.

The minute I started working I took over helping her. She never asked but I wanted to. I couldn\u2019t bear to see her spinning away at a sewing machine toiling to pay bills.

I do wonder if the reaction stemmed from them usually having everything done for them or the resentment from the eldest being always expected to pick up the slack. \n\nWhy are you apologising to her? Are there missing reasons as to why she bursts into tears with you asking for help? Is it a habit of yours to completely depend on her, is that why she needs space? \n\nThere\u2019s two ways this can go, you could of been the type of single parent that completely depends on the eldest to be the second parent, unfortunately you got sick and she got sick of being depended on OR you\u2019ve raised two very self absorbed people that would rather see you desperately in pain than help.

But like, the day that I leave my mum alone, in pain and uncomfortable for the crime of...being disorganised in the face of a cancer diagnosis, is the day hell freezes over. There's literally two of them, surely they can figure it out. Especially 19 who is off having fun.", "Not the same thing. I was planning on driving to her. She\u2019s 10 minutes down the road, drive to the store and then drop her back off. \n\nEVERYTHING else, not expecting her to drop things\u2026 just that one thing because I didn\u2019t want to ask a stranger. I did, but I would have rather had help from my daughter.", "So recently my mother had a benign cyst on her back that was causing her issues.  She told myself and my brother.  Our response to each other... bandage needs changed daily, I'll take today and  tomorrow if you can get the next day.  We proceeded to work out who would go on what day up until they finally did surgery to remove the cyst, and it was fully healed. 10 weeks daily.   It cost us about an hour each day. Not once did we tell her to fend for herself that we were too busy. Sometimes, it did have to be done around work schedules or other appointments, etc. \n\nThe text that was sent does sound like a bit of a guilt trip. But there must be something else to keep them from being willing to help. Either they themselves are selfish or something has been done or said to make them want to distance themselves.  This just doesn't seem like a proper parent/child relationship.  JMHO", "You probably never ASK for help but you probably demand help and then guilt them into doing it. It\u2019s emotional manipulation and that\u2019s awful of a parent to do to a child.", "She sounds like she's extremely overwhelmed. I understand that you are overwhelmed also, but it's not coming across like you are trying to actually understand things from her point of view. She might feel like she's being pulled in all different directions and not doing enough or doing her best because of having so much on her plate. Then being guilt tripped on top of that.....which after reading what you said to her, that was low key guilt tripping. It doesn't have to be bold, in your face statements to be considered guilt tripping. The low key kind is more manipulative and stressful, IMO. It seems like you're making excuses for yourself without really trying to understand her side also...even if she wasn't able to verbalize them due to crying. This is where real empathy come in.\n\nOn the other hand, I would be hurt if my kids couldn't help me with something like that and I had to ask a stranger. I can understand why you feel that way. There are other options you could've taken.  Shoot, take a picture of your back in the bathroom mirror and figure out the bandage size from there. Go to a walk-in clinic for their help with dressing changes if you have no other options. It would suck and isn't ideal, but that's what I would have done in this situation.", "So you didn\u2019t ASK. You demanded that she do it for you and basically said she\u2019s terrible if she doesn\u2019t. YTA.\n\nSaying \u201cI will be hurt if you say no\u201d is manipulative and guilt tripping. You\u2019re not really giving the option to say no. \n\nYou could have asked in a different way that was not manipulative. \u201cHey I really need help. Here\u2019s the situation. I would be really grateful and appreciate it if you could do this for me.\u201d Including a negative consequence for not helping is shitty. She is allowed to say no. \n\nAnd you\u2019re not alone in the world. That\u2019s dramatic and a manipulative thing to say. You know that. As you said, you were able to get assistance from the pharmacist, which is a perfectly reasonable (arguably better) route for assistance with a wound issue. Is it awkward? Sure. But healthcare things are often awkward. It may be awkward for your daughter to look at a big wound on her mother. You could have FaceTimed someone to take a look at it. You could take a picture and send it to your doctor. You could have a Telehealth appointment with a doctor. You could call a nurse line. If all else fails get several sizes of bandage and try them out. Your daughter was not the ONLY solution, clearly, since you were able to resolve it on your own without her. It may have been your preferred route, but you made it sound like the ONLY option which was not true.", "So your daughter was right, cos that message is one GIANT guilt trip.", "Yep,  that is absolutely a guilt trip.

I just struggle to understand how they (especially the 19 yr old) can both just be so blas\u00e9 about what\u2019s needed to run a household and let mess build up whilst your clearly in pain.

Still we don\u2019t have their side of the story so I won\u2019t criticize your daughter but for your question NTA", "Absolutely not.  I don\u2019t care what \u201cnew skill\u201d your daughter is learning, it\u2019s not that important.  The only mistake I think you made was apologizing.  Your daughters need to learn to not be so selfish", "Not going to lie, I had a skin cancer remove from between my shoulder blades.  I was not informed prior to the quick in office procedure that I would not be able to lift anything.  Thankfully my husband handled bandage changes and suture care for me.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your daughters are selfish.  NTA", "Honestly, NTA. Even after reading all your comments, and yes you should have planned better btw, your kids should be able to get up their ass to help their mom recovering from a fucking CANCER surgery. OP didnt even have food and was in pain, and her daughter decided to cry and whine instead of helping, or hiring help", "How big and where was the cancer. I had skin cancer surgery and it was no big deal. I don\u2019t remember having that much restrictions", "YTA poor planning on your part shouldn't constitute an emergency for everyone else. You knew about this surgery in advance and failed to ask about what care would be required after and to get someone lined up to help.\n\nI F53 also have a hard time believing you were so incredibly incapacitated as to be helpless that you couldn't do anything yourself, like grocery shopping. First, you should have gone grocery shopping in advance, but since you didn't, I still think you could have picked a few things up. I had a 2 level spinal fusion with 6 screws and 4 rods and was allowed to lift 5 to 10 lbs immediately out of surgery, and that was with a 6 inch incision that went straight to my spine. Sure, you may not have been able to lift an entire bag of groceries, but you could certainly have them bag a few items in each bag. More bags and more trips back and forth from the car to the house, but each bag light enough to carry. You know how I moved heavier stuff around? A chair with wheels inside the house and a wagon outside. But again, prior planning helped. You weren't helpless.\n\nAgain, 6 inch incision that went straight to the spine, and you know how they told me to clean it? They told me after the 2nd day not to soak it in a bathtub, but to just let warm soapy water run across it in the shower, rinse, then pat dry.  It didn't take significant care. And my surgery was done at Stanford University Medical Center, so I think they know what they're doing. You were told to only keep the bandage on for 24 hours. This was not a significant wound that needed long term bandaging care. And if you really felt it needed changing, you could have called your drs office and they would have told you to come in and had a nursing assistant or a nurse change it for you.\n\nI kind of feel like you really played up the dramatic helplessness of your situation and used it to try to manipulate and guilt your daughters.

I can\u2019t believe the YTA. It\u2019s cancer surgery for crying out loud! I would drop everything and help out my asshole neighbor in such a situation because that is what a good person does.

I had major surgery 8 months ago. I planned meals for the freezer and such, but I was incapacitated over Thanksgiving and Christmas. My men, husband and two teenagers, really stepped up.

They cooked, cleaned, decorated and catered to my every need. \nYou should be able to expect the same from your daughters.", "The main thing I see is how fucked up US are. In my country you get a nurse who will come every day change the bandage (and you won't pay for it)...\n\nThey should have tell you all your limitations on the appointment before the surgery so you could plan to have enough food in your home.

You didn't plan and you could have asked if she could come. Going to the pharmacy and having someone to help you is not the end of the world. \n\nLast time my mom was sick I made sure that my bf could take her to the hospital in the morning cause I needed to go to uni. I wanted to miss class but she was hesitant bc she didn't want me to get late to uni cause I could loose a percentage of my final grade until I offered that my bf went with her, and let me tell you my mom was shivering and crying from the pain and she still politely asked if she could get a chicken soup and she was still worried ab my class. \n\nI don't mean you have to be like my mom but, if both of your daughters reacted that way it must be bc of something, and yes, there are things that are planned and some others that are not, but I bet you just like to make yourself the victim so much that they have just distanced theirselves from you.

I'd expect better help.", "Yes, she should have planned and communicated better, but regardless at the age her kids are, they should realise that even a small surgery will require needing help after. And complications can happen so they should have realised that it could be worse than they thought. After realising how much it dis impact her, they could have spared a few minutes to help change a dressing at the bare minimum. When I was about 9, my mum needed surgery to remove cancer, and I helped as much as I could, granted that wasn't much due to my age, but i tried. If a 9 year old can see their mum needs help and help, a fully grown adult can do the same. They cared more about their hobbies than their mothers' health.

Instead you didn\u2019t care to know the after surgery care needed until after surgery and before that steadfastly said you would need help because.. should don\u2019t like asking for help\u2026 so again because of *your* mistakes.

Her, my brother, and I did everything together even though we are grown and have relationships and kids. My mum was always 1st and foremost to us. She was a single mum. She was strict on us as kids but I never regretted it. All my friends had strict parents too so they also parented us at their house. \nI cannot understand kids not helping their parents.

She waited up for me whenever I went out to make sure I was okay before she went to sleep. Things you take for granted that you missed now.. I hope she knows I appreciated everything she did for me. She had her flaws but that made me love her more. Nothing she did could make me stop loving her. If she was sick, my brother and I dropped everything to go home. When she had to go to the ER, I would stay with her even though I had work in the morning. Covid was the first time I couldn\u2019t be at the hospital with her but my brother was across the hall in a room from her so he was there. At least one of us were. The day she got intubated, my brother pulled off his IV etc to go across the hall. My brother was 38 with a big grown child and he fell to the floor sobbing. \nNo parent is perfect.

I get everyone has different thresholds for pain and different coping skills.. but jeez.

However, I can hardly blame people for not properly preparing themselves for scary medical stuff like cancer surgery. Many people find it hard to think about at all.

Once I had a surgery to remove a clogged vein from my right leg, the doctor told me it was quite simple, only had to stay in the hospital for 3 days, no after surgery proceedings needed. I asked him if I would be able to drive myself home, he said yes. I had no family in that country, just a few friends, none of them too close. So I went to the hospital on my own, got some of those friends visits, it was nice. \n\nThe day to get back home came, got in my car with mechanical clutch, but even if it was automatic, the right leg was barely operational.

It wasnt enough for you. \nYou could have go to the pharmacy take your medecine and wait\u2026 But it s not what you wanted. \nYou think like a child and make a tantrum because of you lack of sleep and pain that resulted in your poor organisation.", ">I wasn\u2019t trying to guilt trip her\n\n\"you have a right to say no\u2026 yet I will be very hurt if you do because I am pretty desperate for help and basically alone in the world.\"", "Definition of guilt trip: \u201cmake (someone) feel guilty, especially in order to induce them to do something.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what you did.", "then what was your goal in saying 'I will be hurt if you say no' and 'I am expecting you to say no'?", "You may have been desperately reaching out for help, but you were guilt tripping her *hard* to get it. \n\nTry thinking about if you had sent this: \u201chey DAUGHTER, I know you have X thing to do, but I need more help than I thought I would today after my surgery. Can you come over and help me with XYZ? I\u2019m pretty desperate. If you can, I can help you with ABC task to get you back on track for the day.\u201d \n\nIt sounds like the skill she is learning requires her physical presence, so while that\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s not around to help you, it\u2019s not her fault that she\u2019s unavailable and she doesn\u2019t deserve to be guilt tripped so hard for it.", "You are unconsciously manipulating your daughter. \n\nYTA", "Yes you were. It was a major guilt trip. And you are still trying to do it.", "How is presentation at school and medical help the same?", "I wasn\u2019t trying to guilt trip her.

Asking for medical help is a much bigger deal and can involve asking someone to do a lot of things they may be uncomfortable with in a high-stakes situation.", "You're not reading what we're trying to say, are you? It doesn't matter if you were in excruciating pain, it doesn't give you the right to guilt trip your daughter... how difficult would it have been to send her a message where you ONLY ask for help?? \"Hi daughter, I'm having a few issues doing this and that by myself. Would you be able to help me with blah blah blah?\"???? How difficult is that???", "You guilt tripped her. It\u2019s obvious.", "your message to your daughter is so passive aggressive even I got annoyed. You were guilt tripping her. You could have communicated normally you know? You could explain your situation without the added drama in the text. You're hungry and you need groceries? Is delivery not an option?

It\u2019s a good thing your mother is perfect, and knows all the right things to say to you. Or maybe she never needs help. I don\u2019t know.

This isn\u2019t about the cancer surgery, if this were a healthy mother-daughter dynamic they would have figured something out because OP is right that this is absurd. It\u2019s obvious that we\u2019re missing important context about their relationship (that I imagine OP hasn\u2019t come to terms with herself)."]}
