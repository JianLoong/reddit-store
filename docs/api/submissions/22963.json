The instructions were to keep the bandage on for 24 hrs and not lift ANYTHING for two weeks to a month, else I may bust my stitches.\n\nI asked my kids for help around the house and they both said they were too busy. One (19f) going out of town and the other (23f) said she had a project to do, (she\u2019s learning a new skill so she can get a better job.) I\u2019m happy the one is getting to have some fun, and the other I\u2019m proud she\u2019s improving her life. But seriously, this sucks. I can\u2019t afford hiring someone to help out.\n\n\nSo I asked a man on our second date to go grocery shopping, so I could feed the cat and get milk. Thank god, he was nice and didn\u2019t mind my messy-ish house. \n\n(I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be incapacitated like this or I would have planned better.)\n\nThe next day when I changed my bandage, the wound was bigger than I expected and the ones that I bought were too small. I tried to use one, but it laid on top of my stitches. The pain was terrible, but I didn\u2019t have anything else and it\u2019s on my shoulder blade, so it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get to.\n\nI needed help. I contacted my friends but they were all busy. So I reached out to my daughter who said she was studying a new skill, and I explained that I was desperate for help. I couldn\u2019t see my back, I didn\u2019t sleep much because every time I rolled over, I woke from the pain. She said she could, but not until 10 or 11 pm that night, and she had another thing in an hour.\n\nI called her, I thought I could pick her up quickly, run to the store, and get her back home for her thing. If she was late, I figured people would forgive her because she was helping her mom. She started crying because I was giving her a guilt trip and she needed to breath, exasperated I hung up.\n\nI ended up going to the pharmacy, and the nice pharmacist helped and put it on my back\u2026 in the store, where anyone could see. It was weird asking a stranger and being exposed in public, but she was kind, and said I could come back again to put on the bandaid the next day.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t know it would be so easy. I did feel terrible that my daughter cried, and sent a text apology which she hasn\u2019t responded to.\n\nBut I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t often ask for help. I ALWAYS bend over backwards, spend time and money (that I don\u2019t have,) do whatever I can for my kids\u2026 but this hurt a lot because I really wanted her to help me verses a stranger.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think and am going around and around in my head. \n\nI\u2019ve never wanted to emotional manipulate my children, I don\u2019t even point out my hardships or how I\u2019ve sacrificed for them, but I LEGIT needed help, was alone, sleep deprived and in pain\u2026 also hungry\u2026 but that\u2019s another story.\n\nAITA?

You\u2019ve taught them that you don\u2019t need their help by diminishing any suffering you\u2019ve undergone for years.

She told you she could help but you'd have to wait because she was busy.

The minute I started working I took over helping her. She never asked but I wanted to. I couldn\u2019t bear to see her spinning away at a sewing machine toiling to pay bills.

I do wonder if the reaction stemmed from them usually having everything done for them or the resentment from the eldest being always expected to pick up the slack. \n\nWhy are you apologising to her? Are there missing reasons as to why she bursts into tears with you asking for help? Is it a habit of yours to completely depend on her, is that why she needs space? \n\nThere\u2019s two ways this can go, you could of been the type of single parent that completely depends on the eldest to be the second parent, unfortunately you got sick and she got sick of being depended on OR you\u2019ve raised two very self absorbed people that would rather see you desperately in pain than help.

But like, the day that I leave my mum alone, in pain and uncomfortable for the crime of...being disorganised in the face of a cancer diagnosis, is the day hell freezes over. There's literally two of them, surely they can figure it out. Especially 19 who is off having fun.", "Not the same thing. I was planning on driving to her. She\u2019s 10 minutes down the road, drive to the store and then drop her back off. \n\nEVERYTHING else, not expecting her to drop things\u2026 just that one thing because I didn\u2019t want to ask a stranger. I did, but I would have rather had help from my daughter.", "So recently my mother had a benign cyst on her back that was causing her issues.  She told myself and my brother.  Our response to each other... bandage needs changed daily, I'll take today and  tomorrow if you can get the next day.  We proceeded to work out who would go on what day up until they finally did surgery to remove the cyst, and it was fully healed. 10 weeks daily.   It cost us about an hour each day. Not once did we tell her to fend for herself that we were too busy. Sometimes, it did have to be done around work schedules or other appointments, etc. \n\nThe text that was sent does sound like a bit of a guilt trip. But there must be something else to keep them from being willing to help. Either they themselves are selfish or something has been done or said to make them want to distance themselves.  This just doesn't seem like a proper parent/child relationship.  JMHO", "You probably never ASK for help but you probably demand help and then guilt them into doing it. It\u2019s emotional manipulation and that\u2019s awful of a parent to do to a child.", "She sounds like she's extremely overwhelmed. I understand that you are overwhelmed also, but it's not coming across like you are trying to actually understand things from her point of view. She might feel like she's being pulled in all different directions and not doing enough or doing her best because of having so much on her plate. Then being guilt tripped on top of that.....which after reading what you said to her, that was low key guilt tripping. It doesn't have to be bold, in your face statements to be considered guilt tripping. The low key kind is more manipulative and stressful, IMO. It seems like you're making excuses for yourself without really trying to understand her side also...even if she wasn't able to verbalize them due to crying. This is where real empathy come in.\n\nOn the other hand, I would be hurt if my kids couldn't help me with something like that and I had to ask a stranger. I can understand why you feel that way. There are other options you could've taken.  Shoot, take a picture of your back in the bathroom mirror and figure out the bandage size from there. Go to a walk-in clinic for their help with dressing changes if you have no other options. It would suck and isn't ideal, but that's what I would have done in this situation.", "So you didn\u2019t ASK. You demanded that she do it for you and basically said she\u2019s terrible if she doesn\u2019t. YTA.\n\nSaying \u201cI will be hurt if you say no\u201d is manipulative and guilt tripping. You\u2019re not really giving the option to say no. \n\nYou could have asked in a different way that was not manipulative. \u201cHey I really need help. Here\u2019s the situation. I would be really grateful and appreciate it if you could do this for me.\u201d Including a negative consequence for not helping is shitty. She is allowed to say no. \n\nAnd you\u2019re not alone in the world. That\u2019s dramatic and a manipulative thing to say. You know that. As you said, you were able to get assistance from the pharmacist, which is a perfectly reasonable (arguably better) route for assistance with a wound issue. Is it awkward? Sure. But healthcare things are often awkward. It may be awkward for your daughter to look at a big wound on her mother. You could have FaceTimed someone to take a look at it. You could take a picture and send it to your doctor. You could have a Telehealth appointment with a doctor. You could call a nurse line. If all else fails get several sizes of bandage and try them out. Your daughter was not the ONLY solution, clearly, since you were able to resolve it on your own without her.

I just struggle to understand how they (especially the 19 yr old) can both just be so blas\u00e9 about what\u2019s needed to run a household and let mess build up whilst your clearly in pain.

Still we don\u2019t have their side of the story so I won\u2019t criticize your daughter but for your question NTA", "Absolutely not.  I don\u2019t care what \u201cnew skill\u201d your daughter is learning, it\u2019s not that important.  The only mistake I think you made was apologizing.  Your daughters need to learn to not be so selfish", "Not going to lie, I had a skin cancer remove from between my shoulder blades.  I was not informed prior to the quick in office procedure that I would not be able to lift anything.  Thankfully my husband handled bandage changes and suture care for me.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your daughters are selfish.  NTA", "Honestly, NTA. Even after reading all your comments, and yes you should have planned better btw, your kids should be able to get up their ass to help their mom recovering from a fucking CANCER surgery. OP didnt even have food and was in pain, and her daughter decided to cry and whine instead of helping, or hiring help", "How big and where was the cancer. I had skin cancer surgery and it was no big deal. I don\u2019t remember having that much restrictions", "YTA poor planning on your part shouldn't constitute an emergency for everyone else. You knew about this surgery in advance and failed to ask about what care would be required after and to get someone lined up to help.\n\nI F53 also have a hard time believing you were so incredibly incapacitated as to be helpless that you couldn't do anything yourself, like grocery shopping. First, you should have gone grocery shopping in advance, but since you didn't, I still think you could have picked a few things up. I had a 2 level spinal fusion with 6 screws and 4 rods and was allowed to lift 5 to 10 lbs immediately out of surgery, and that was with a 6 inch incision that went straight to my spine. Sure, you may not have been able to lift an entire bag of groceries, but you could certainly have them bag a few items in each bag. More bags and more trips back and forth from the car to the house, but each bag light enough to carry. You know how I moved heavier stuff around? A chair with wheels inside the house and a wagon outside. But again, prior planning helped. You weren't helpless.\n\nAgain, 6 inch incision that went straight to the spine, and you know how they told me to clean it? They told me after the 2nd day not to soak it in a bathtub, but to just let warm soapy water run across it in the shower, rinse, then pat dry.  It didn't take significant care. And my surgery was done at Stanford University Medical Center, so I think they know what they're doing. You were told to only keep the bandage on for 24 hours. This was not a significant wound that needed long term bandaging care. And if you really felt it needed changing within that 24 hours, you could have called your drs office and they would have told you to come in and had a nursing assistant or a nurse change it for you.\n\nI kind of feel like you really played up the dramatic helplessness of your situation and used it to try to manipulate and guilt your daughters.

I had major surgery 8 months ago. I planned meals for the freezer and such, but I was incapacitated over Thanksgiving and Christmas. My men, husband and two teenagers, really stepped up.

They cooked, cleaned, decorated and catered to my every need. \nYou should be able to expect the same from your daughters.", "The main thing I see is how fucked up US are. In my country you get a nurse who will come every day change the bandage (and you won't pay for it)...\n\nThey should have tell you all your limitations on the appointment before the surgery so you could plan to have enough food in your home. Depending of your situation you could have a nurse to help you dress. It should be mandatory to tell you all the informations even if you don't ask. You can't think of all the questions when you are in a stress situation. \n\nAlso, we have privacy rooms in our pharmacy... When they need to take mesures of ankles/wrist or anything or for vaccines.

She was strict on us as kids but I never regretted it. All my friends had strict parents too so they also parented us at their house. \nI cannot understand kids not helping their parents.

She had her flaws but that made me love her more. Nothing she did could make me stop loving her. If she was sick, my brother and I dropped everything to go home. When she had to go to the ER, I would stay with her even though I had work in the morning. Covid was the first time I couldn\u2019t be at the hospital with her but my brother was across the hall in a room from her so he was there. At least one of us were. The day she got intubated, my brother pulled off his IV etc to go across the hall. My brother was 38 with a big grown child and he fell to the floor sobbing. \nNo parent is perfect.

I asked him if I would be able to drive myself home, he said yes. I had no family in that country, just a few friends, none of them too close. So I went to the hospital on my own, got some of those friends visits, it was nice. \n\nThe day to get back home came, got in my car with mechanical clutch, but even if it was automatic, the right leg was barely operational.

Because you're approaching everyone here the same way you approached your daughter.\n\n\"I just wanted some help\" - This has been your rallying cry, except, here's the problem. You were going to get help. Your daughter said she would. The problem you had was that it wasn't on your timetable. Your daughter was willing to help based on what she was able to do, but that wasn't acceptable to you because it was N O W. You didn't plan ahead, by your own admission, and you expected (and before you say 'I told her she could say no', that doesn't change the expectation you put into your actions) your daughter to drop something that you know is important to her at a moment's notice because of your lack of planning.\n\n\"I apologized, but hell... I would helped my mother...\" - This is another sticking point you repeat over and over. Firstly, you may have said the words, but you clearly haven't actually apologized. 'I'm sorry, but...' isn't an apology, and the fact you keep claiming you would have helped your own mother as though it's a strike against your daughter shows you aren't sorry. Also, just like you 'would have helped your mother', so would she... If you had given her the chance. But you didn't, like I said above, because you didn't accept her help on her terms, it had to be 'now'.\n\n\"Buy a bunch of bandages! Did they know I struggled to pay the copay and I'm in debt?\" - I left this point to last, because it does illustrate a lot of the issue here. I have to make some assumptions, so please forgive if they're slightly incorrect, but the sentiment here still works regardless. I assume that's directed at us commenters, to which I have to respond, how would we know when you haven't told us? Just like your family didn't know you needed help when you didn't tell them? It's not fair on those around you when you expect them to know absolutely everything without actually telling them. And though I know nothing about the US health system (thank god), I highly doubt that you went straight to the operating table at the first appointment. Surely there were times when you could have asked questions, like what size bandages you would have needed, what kind of assistance you might need to sort out ahead of time? You said this was your second time under the knife, so you should know you have no excuses for not having the information you need. The decisions that were made that led to you needing your daughter's aid were made by you, and you alone, and you can't reasonably blame them for not being able to help at the second you needed it if they weren't prepared for it.\n\nI want to end this on one final point, looping back to what I said at the start. You've been defending your actions with your daughter by saying you were tired, hungry and sleep deprived. And unless you're all three again as you've been replying to this post you've made, you've shown that you would have send the same message regardless. You've lashed out at people pointing out the guilt-tripping in your responses, often devolving into histrionics like where you decided that another commenter must have had a perfect mother who made no mistakes just because they were calling you out on yours. You also keep deflecting by saying how horrible you feel with people making you face your own words and deeds. But I don't recall a single time you've actually considered how your daughter feels, that she did offer to help you when you asked, you told her that wasn't good enough because she wasn't going to drop everything, and then you made her CRY over your actions. If you can, I want you to divorce yourself from the situation. Take yourself, and your daughters, and all of your problems away from this. Make up a fake scenario, outrageous and outlandish where there's a clear, irredeemable asshole. Then re-read your comments as if they came from that asshole. Can you defend those comments then in good faith?\n\nYou may not be irredeemable, though I am leaning that if this is what you consider healthy forms of communication at your age, it may be too late, but as it currently stands, the way you're communicating with your daughters is going to keep pushing them further away as they get older and far less willing to deal with guilt trips and the expectation that they will put their life on hold for your poor planning. YTA\n\n(I don't expect you to respond.) - How does it feel when someone pulls that shit on you?", "My bio mum died when I was a child. I would drop everything without a thought to go help her or my adoptive mother. When my adoptive father got hospitalised, I jumped on the next flight even to I knew there was nothing I could do other than be there. \n\nThe fact that your daughter wouldn't delay her plans for 30 minutes to help you is heartbreaking and fucking terrible, and you deserve better.

This just doesn't seem like a proper parent/child relationship.\n\nPERFECTLY SAID. The fact that neither daughter could move things around for their own mother made my spidey senses go off, and honestly, all these people in the comments going *\"but you wouldn't drop everything to help YoUr OwN mOm??1//1//\"* probably have much healthier relationships with their parents than the kind OP has with her kids.", "To be fair she did ask (see her comment below) but with a healthy side serving of \u201cI know you have the right to say no and I\u2019m expecting you to, but I will be hurt if you say no because I\u2019m all alone in the world\u201d. \n\nAs someone with a mother who I desperately love but can make passive aggressive guilt trips like that, let me tell you that\u2019s messages like that don\u2019t make me want to help her.

Does mom pull this kind of thing often? I don\u2019t know OP so I\u2019m not gonna judge her with the lack of more extended info, but my mom is like that. Damn near constantly.

So now I\u2019ve become more distant about helping her, because she takes advantage and doesn\u2019t appreciate it or reciprocate. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s absolutely understandable for the daughters to have distanced themselves, stopped volunteering help unasked and set boundaries around when and how they\u2019re willing to help her out when they are asked. Such as \u201cI\u2019m available at 10pm tonight but busy until then\u201d. \n\nLike I said, I don\u2019t know OP, and different people are different, but my mother very easily could have written this AITA about my sister or about me if the details of the situation matched up to anything that actually happened in my family.", "I get she could have communicated a bit more and gave notice.\n\nBut in the same breath, just help your mom?

I drove her to the doctors, to get blood tests, to the pharmacy, then to the hospital. I then did shopping for her and brought it to her in the hospital because she didn\u2019t bring anything like a change of underwear or deodorant because she didn\u2019t anticipate she\u2019d end up spending so much time in. Could she have planned better, and taken stuff with her \u201cjust in case?\u201d Of course. And in hindsight, she knows she should have.

OPs kids needed only to take an hour out of their day to help their parent. OP could\u2019ve handled her side of things with a bit more common sense and pre planning. But their kid could also show some compassion. Meet in the middle. Something more than guilt tripping via crying because they\u2019re being asked to help.

She was a great mom but spoiled them and made them selfish, she was a great mom who did everything right but they are just a product of their generation despite moms actions, or she wasn\u2019t a great mom which is why neither daughter would drop everything for her and she wants sympathy to guilt trip them further.
