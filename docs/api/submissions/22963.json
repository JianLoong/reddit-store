The instructions were to keep the bandage on for 24 hrs and not lift ANYTHING for two weeks to a month, else I may bust my stitches.\n\nI asked my kids for help around the house and they both said they were too busy. One (19f) going out of town and the other (23f) said she had a project to do, (she\u2019s learning a new skill so she can get a better job.) I\u2019m happy the one is getting to have some fun, and the other I\u2019m proud she\u2019s improving her life. But seriously, this sucks. I can\u2019t afford hiring someone to help out.\n\n\nSo I asked a man on our second date to go grocery shopping, so I could feed the cat and get milk. Thank god, he was nice and didn\u2019t mind my messy-ish house. \n\n(I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be incapacitated like this or I would have planned better.)\n\nThe next day when I changed my bandage, the wound was bigger than I expected and the ones that I bought were too small. I tried to use one, but it laid on top of my stitches. The pain was terrible, but I didn\u2019t have anything else and it\u2019s on my shoulder blade, so it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get to.\n\nI needed help. I contacted my friends but they were all busy. So I reached out to my daughter who said she was studying a new skill, and I explained that I was desperate for help. I couldn\u2019t see my back, I didn\u2019t sleep much because every time I rolled over, I woke from the pain. She said she could, but not until 10 or 11 pm that night, and she had another thing in an hour.\n\nI called her, I thought I could pick her up quickly, run to the store, and get her back home for her thing. If she was late, I figured people would forgive her because she was helping her mom. She started crying because I was giving her a guilt trip and she needed to breath, exasperated I hung up.\n\nI ended up going to the pharmacy, and the nice pharmacist helped and put it on my back\u2026 in the store, where anyone could see. It was weird asking a stranger and being exposed in public, but she was kind, and said I could come back again to put on the bandaid the next day.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t know it would be so easy. I did feel terrible that my daughter cried, and sent a text apology which she hasn\u2019t responded to.\n\nBut I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t often ask for help. I ALWAYS bend over backwards, spend time and money (that I don\u2019t have,) do whatever I can for my kids\u2026 but this hurt a lot because I really wanted her to help me verses a stranger.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think and am going around and around in my head. \n\nI\u2019ve never wanted to emotional manipulate my children, I don\u2019t even point out my hardships or how I\u2019ve sacrificed for them, but I LEGIT needed help, was alone, sleep deprived and in pain\u2026 also hungry\u2026 but that\u2019s another story.\n\nAITA?

You\u2019ve taught them that you don\u2019t need their help by diminishing any suffering you\u2019ve undergone for years.

She told you she could help but you'd have to wait because she was busy.

I do wonder if the reaction stemmed from them usually having everything done for them or the resentment from the eldest being always expected to pick up the slack. \n\nWhy are you apologising to her? Are there missing reasons as to why she bursts into tears with you asking for help? Is it a habit of yours to completely depend on her, is that why she needs space? \n\nThere\u2019s two ways this can go, you could of been the type of single parent that completely depends on the eldest to be the second parent, unfortunately you got sick and she got sick of being depended on OR you\u2019ve raised two very self absorbed people that would rather see you desperately in pain than help.

She\u2019s 10 minutes down the road, drive to the store and then drop her back off. \n\nEVERYTHING else, not expecting her to drop things\u2026 just that one thing because I didn\u2019t want to ask a stranger. I did, but I would have rather had help from my daughter.", "So recently my mother had a benign cyst on her back that was causing her issues.  She told myself and my brother.  Our response to each other... bandage needs changed daily, I'll take today and  tomorrow if you can get the next day.  We proceeded to work out who would go on what day up until they finally did surgery to remove the cyst, and it was fully healed. 10 weeks daily.   It cost us about an hour each day. Not once did we tell her to fend for herself that we were too busy. Sometimes, it did have to be done around work schedules or other appointments, etc. \n\nThe text that was sent does sound like a bit of a guilt trip. But there must be something else to keep them from being willing to help. Either they themselves are selfish or something has been done or said to make them want to distance themselves.  This just doesn't seem like a proper parent/child relationship.  JMHO", "You probably never ASK for help but you probably demand help and then guilt them into doing it. It\u2019s emotional manipulation and that\u2019s awful of a parent to do to a child.", "She sounds like she's extremely overwhelmed. I understand that you are overwhelmed also, but it's not coming across like you are trying to actually understand things from her point of view. She might feel like she's being pulled in all different directions and not doing enough or doing her best because of having so much on her plate. Then being guilt tripped on top of that.....which after reading what you said to her, that was low key guilt tripping. It doesn't have to be bold, in your face statements to be considered guilt tripping. The low key kind is more manipulative and stressful, IMO. It seems like you're making excuses for yourself without really trying to understand her side also...even if she wasn't able to verbalize them due to crying. This is where real empathy come in.\n\nOn the other hand, I would be hurt if my kids couldn't help me with something like that and I had to ask a stranger. I can understand why you feel that way. There are other options you could've taken.  Shoot, take a picture of your back in the bathroom mirror and figure out the bandage size from there. Go to a walk-in clinic for their help with dressing changes if you have no other options. It would suck and isn't ideal, but that's what I would have done in this situation.", "So you didn\u2019t ASK. You demanded that she do it for you and basically said she\u2019s terrible if she doesn\u2019t. YTA.\n\nSaying \u201cI will be hurt if you say no\u201d is manipulative and guilt tripping. You\u2019re not really giving the option to say no. \n\nYou could have asked in a different way that was not manipulative. \u201cHey I really need help. Here\u2019s the situation. I would be really grateful and appreciate it if you could do this for me.\u201d Including a negative consequence for not helping is shitty. She is allowed to say no. \n\nAnd you\u2019re not alone in the world. That\u2019s dramatic and a manipulative thing to say. You know that. As you said, you were able to get assistance from the pharmacist, which is a perfectly reasonable (arguably better) route for assistance with a wound issue. Is it awkward? Sure. But healthcare things are often awkward. It may be awkward for your daughter to look at a big wound on her mother. You could have FaceTimed someone to take a look at it. You could take a picture and send it to your doctor. You could have a Telehealth appointment with a doctor. You could call a nurse line. If all else fails get several sizes of bandage and try them out. Your daughter was not the ONLY solution, clearly, since you were able to resolve it on your own without her. It may have been your preferred route, but you made it sound like the ONLY option which was not true.", "So your daughter was right, cos that message is one GIANT guilt trip.", "Yep,  that is absolutely a guilt trip. YTA", "You 100% guilt-tripped her, but she still should have helped you. You're her mother and you're in pain!", "I don't see any guilt tripping, if this is an adequate representation of what happened.", "Right sometimes you can\u2019t plan, but that\u2019s not what happened in this particular instance. You had the option to plan ahead and chose to avoid it.", "Your bad planning became your daughter's problem. She could have gone and get the bandages but did you even consider that all that shit made her unconfortable ? \n\nMy mother and my brother were right there with me for 6 months. My brother went to the hospital a couple of times only because it freaked him out. He never did anything medical, neither did my mother, because they weren't confortable with it. \n\nI get that your were freaked but you had other options. You just chose to put your problems on people who may not have been able to deal with medical issues.", "Cyber hugs.. so sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that.", "Or maybe this is a pattern of behavior you haven\u2019t noticed about yourself until now.  When you do ask for help, do you demand they do it when/how you want it done?  \n\nMy grandmother use to do that.  She was a wonderful woman, but a lot of family members would not pick up the phone when she called unless they were totally free at that moment because she wanted whatever chore done TODAY and would nag constantly until someone did it.\n\nYou seem very \u201cwoe is me\u201d instead of looking at what part you might have played in an interaction where your daughter to burst into tears.\n\nEdit: spelling", "No, it\u2019s a child\u2019s nature to love her mother. My father mistreated my mother and it made us hate him, not her. Something is off, here.", "Yes. That wasn\u2019t good on my part. I didn\u2019t want to ask her. Of my friends\u2026 one had work, one was having an MS flare and couldn\u2019t walk, one is reconciling with his ex-wife and she\u2019s jealous of me so he\u2019s being distant, and the other was getting it on with his new gf.\n\nThis couldn\u2019t be worse. I am usually very independent, but I just missed the mark this time. I hated to ask. I hated to hurt her feelings, but in the moment, I desperately wanted her help. Didn\u2019t get it. Am hurt.", "It wasn\u2019t major which is why I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. I had one removed years ago, but it was on my chest. I didn\u2019t think this out very well.", "Yeah I get that, I don\u2019t blame you! I saw in your other comment what you messaged her and the only bit that would irk me would be how you were kinda like \u201cyou don\u2019t have to say no, it is your right to say no but don\u2019t you say no or else\u201d at the end. HOWEVER if you were my mum I\u2019d let it slide because you\u2019ve just had cancer surgery, in pain and sleep deprived. If you\u2019ve been downplaying it up til this point that maybe a factor in why they don\u2019t see an issue but it is a big deal and you need to advocate for your recovery.\n\nOnly question I\u2019ve got left if were they brought up to contribute to the house, like chores and helping out? I just struggle to understand how they (especially the 19 yr old) can both just be so blas\u00e9 about what\u2019s needed to run a household and let mess build up whilst your clearly in pain. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask for help in that regard, the 19yr old especially should be stepping up as they are living there half the time.", "Read her comment where she posted the texts.\n\nIt was emotional manipulation. The daughter was right to be upset.", "100% this", "She was about to go to a fun thing from 3 to 10 pm. It wasn\u2019t work or her independent training.", "I guess so.", "But I didn\u2019t know the size of my wound. I had bandages, they were the wrong size. How would I know that? I couldn\u2019t see it for 24 hours. \n\nAnd in life, sometimes people just need help. I think it\u2019s fair to expect friends and family to help first\u2026 because that\u2019s what we do.", "I usually like the lack of planning/emergency phrase that applies to unprepared people. But like I think if your mum accidentally messed up organising her cancer care and is in pain and with no access to food...if that's not an emergency to you, you're shitty. No organisational fuck up would make me prioritise fun over helping a parent with cancer.", "So all those times I dropped everything for her, to help her, I shouldn\u2019t have? \n\nIs that how it is?", "Obviously my situation was a lot more annoying, but the lesson is the same. If you're having any procedure done, communicate with the adults in your life to make sure they will have the ability to adequately help you if you needed. Even simple procedures can go all squirrelly and not everyone will be able to rearrange their lives at the drop of a hat when you need help.\n\nYour daughter had to be somewhere in an hour. Driving around for 10 minutes, running to the store with you, helping you, etc now puts her in a crunch. You don't know how it could have affected her if she'd be late. She's an adult and I assume not someone you raised to be selfish. You didn't give your kids or yourself the benefits of planning better and making sure you'd have people available to help you if needed.\n\nFwiw, I make it a point to talk directly with my father's doctors and surgeons now before any procedure to make sure he's not totally underselling how much of a commitment I will have to make.", "Don't forget grocery delivery is a thing too!", "So you wouldn\u2019t have helped your mother in the same situation if she begged for help, was in pain and unable to help herself?", "\u201cI will be hurt if you say no\u201d\n\u201cI am alone in the world\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s guilt tripping.", "I just needed to too look at my back and help me find the right size and maybe help me on with it.\n\nIt\u2019s gross. I hated that, but fuck\u2026 human beings have gross things to deal with. Like\u2026 she doesn\u2019t like bugs, and neither do I, but I went into her apartment when she moved in and killed every single one of them.", "My kids love me. They think their dad is great. I\u2019m not sure if they understood the extent to his abuse. He hid A LOT of it and always seemed like the \u201cnormal\u201d one. Successful in his career. Usually even tempered. But he cheated on me because I had postpartum depression, was emotionally abusive and manipulative.\n\nBut he financially provided and doted on the kids, and is married to the woman he left me for\u2026 and they have built a stable life for our children. \n\nIt has been difficult for me to recover from all of that and do this on my own with few friend and the only family I have here are by children\u2026 and I only stayed in town for them.\n\nIt seems like most are blaming me. It feels harsh. And I\u2019m in a bad spot. I hate feeling needy. I think all in all, it\u2019s making me think that it doesn\u2019t matter what I do for my kids, I need to move on and get on with my life.", "Just because it\u2019s not work related doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t an important thing for her.", "You buy multiple sizes of bandages the week before your surgery & return the ones you don\u2019t open. You went on a date in your post-surgery condition. This was not an emergency. YTA.", "Your discharge instructions would have given you all the info you need. If you weren\u2019t provided any, why not call your doctor?", "The wound and bandage questions seem more appropriate for your doctor to advise on/assist with.\n\nYes, people need help but they should not feel entitled to demand it. Saying no does not make her a bad person. You can ask for help. She can say no.\n\nIf you had discussed it with her in advance, she agreed to help you, then she bailed at the last minute - THAT would be an asshole move.", "It wasn\u2019t accidental. She had weeks of notice and \u201cput it out of her mind\u201d and intentionally did not ask for help in advance. I feel like this is a direct consequence of those choices. \n\nI feel like if it was a true unexpected/unavoidable emergency, like \u201cI prepared in advance as I was supposed to, but now have an infection and need to go to the hospital\u201d then that would be a different story.", "What you wrote here has the answer to the questions you asked. \n\nYou are expecting compensation for your parenting. It\u2019s your job as a parent to care for and \u201cdrop things\u201d for your child. You are not entitled to her time or to disrupt her schedule simply because you gave her life. \n\nI\u2019m sure at this point she wishes you didn\u2019t \u201cdrop things\u201d for her because you are wielding care like a weapon. \n\nStop reacting and defending your position and start really thinking about what people are taking the time to tell you here. \n\nYTA", "You can choose to help her when you want to. You can also choose to say no if you want to. If you\u2019re helping her only to cash in on it later because she \u201cowes you\u201d that\u2019s not right. If you feel that the times you helped her are no longer \u201cworth it\u201d because you\u2019re not getting a return on that investment, that\u2019s shitty.", "You are the parent. It\u2019s nice if our kids want to contribute to our care after they are grown, but it\u2019s not an obligation. Parenting is an obligation. Stop bending over backwards for your adult daughter if you expect reciprocity, that\u2019s not how having kids (of any age) works.", "Yes, that is how it is. You decided to have children, you were responsible for their care. She didn't decide to have an irresponsible parent who couldn't plan ahead.", "I was torn when you originally posted, I was sort of leaning to NTA/ESH because I remember when my mom was dying of cancer and how often something would go wrong or unexpectedly and that it was never a moments hesitation to help\u2026but every reply you\u2019ve made since makes me almost certain YTA.\n\nThe transactional view you\u2019ve taken to raising children YOU brought into the world makes me question you as a narrator (and parent).\n\nI dropped EVERYTHING for my mom because she *earned* it (the benefit of the doubt and compassion) without ever making me feel indebted to her, because I **knew** she would never want me to suffer for her poor planning or fear response\u2026but that doesn\u2019t seem to be your relationship or parenting style.\n\nI very much doubt this is the first \u2018guilt trip\u2019 you\u2019ve stacked on their shoulders, which makes their hesitancy to help much more understandable.\n\nYTA", "Yup! There are a plethora of options to get shit done rather than putting it all on your child with short notice.", "I would help my mum if she was a situation where she needed help and actually asked properly. If I received a message like the one you sent, demanding my time when you purposely didn't plan for your aftercare and then expect your child to cancel her premade plans at the drop of a hat, then I would definitely be having doubts about helping. \n\nYou sound somewhat narcissistic in that you expect others lives to revolve around you. Even the help you have given your daughters in the past seems like you do it to be able to make yourself the martyr. \"I spent money I don't have\" - that was your choice, you can't hold your bad decisions over them.", "That's not the point. She said you guilt tripped her and got upset. You posted here with what you sent her and people are saying yeah that's a guilt trip. This comment itself is a guilt trip! Have some self reflection.", "I call it being overdramatic. I would have said , geez mom, I am coming. She did have to rely on the kindness of strangers. If my mom had a procedure, I would have made time to check in on her at least once.", "Didn\u2019t know. The office was closed. They said I could come in\u2026 but closed. I had a therapy appointment that went long because I was processing a rather recent traumatic event\u2026 which I did not foresee being a problem. Not the greatest week of my life, but I\u2019m doing my best to stay on this planet and proceed.\n\nI\u2019m a human being just like anyone. I do my best and make mistakes. It sucks because I thought she might help, but she spiraled and cried and shut down.\n\nWhat do you do when you are less than perfect and need help?\n\nHow do you navigate the world when you don\u2019t know who you can depend on?", "Mmmhmmm. Yes, I didn\u2019t plan ahead, but I did. I had bandages, but they were the wrong size. I was mistaken.\n\nI guess that\u2019s how you treat your mom? If she makes a mistake and is in a bad way, you\u2019re all kinds of \u201cTough shit mom. You should have planned better. Not my fault, I didn\u2019t ask to be born.\u201d", "I was going to pick her up. And YES\u2026 being honest with how important it was to me, it would and did hurt my feeling if she said no, which is why I told her that. I was being honest. I was desperate for help, in pain, sleep deprived and hungry\u2026 those things were not her fault, I just wanted help.", "Needing help and asking for help is not the asshole part.\n\nFeeling you are entitled that they must say yes to helping and are jerks if they don\u2019t and then guilt tripping them - that\u2019s the asshole part.\n\nAs an adult, I know I am ultimately responsible for myself. Again, you had time to plan ahead and make arrangements to avoid this and chose to avoid it. These are the consequences.", "Your comment shows that your daughter\u2019s right. You do guilt trip. You didn\u2019t like what someone said and immediately jump to implying they are a bad person. You should probably take a look at that. It\u2019s a toxic way to communicate and will not improve your relationships."]}
