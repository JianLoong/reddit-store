She tried to find a job, but every place around us hires at 16. She earns between $10-$15 a day, works Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays 8-4PM. Shes trying to earn money to buy this piece of gymnastics equipment shes wanted for years, which is almost $600\n\nLately, since she has been earning money, I have been making her pay for things. She has been inconsiderate and eating a lot lately. (She is 5'5.5, 96 lbs, and has a fast metabolism and is always hungry). When she eats her younger siblings snacks, or eats a lot of something that was supposed to be shared, like drinks, etc, I will make her pay for a replacement. that has kind of delyad her from getting her equipment, and because of our summer trips.\n\n2 or 3 months ago, I got an email from our local library saying we had overdue books. We went and found out Brylee had damaged a book and lost 2 others. I told her she would have to use her money to pay for them and she was sad but understood she needed consequences for her actions. I wasnt able to pay that day because I had to wait for my next paycheck. I wasnt able to go for a long time because of work, my children's activities, chores etc. Its hard being able to do things with 4 kids in the house, so i couldnt make time for the library.\n\nMonday last week, she earned enough, but I told her to wait for my next paycheck. we had just helped her brother move into college. the paycheck comes Friday. I told her we would be going to the Library this week.\n\nWe went to the library yesterday and they informed us that since it had been months, there would be a late fee. Without the fee, Brylee's total would've been $30, and she still would've had enough to buy her equipment on Friday since she had still worked the rest of the week and Monday this week. but they added a $40 fee, making the total $70 which i thought was ridiculous. I wasnt told there would be a late fee\n\nIn the car, Brylee was talking about how happy she was to buy her equipment. I told her with the late fee she wouldnt be able to get it until next week. Brylee got angry and said it wasnt her fault i didnt take her in time so she shouldn't have had to pay the late fee. I told her she lost the books so she has to pay the price for them.\n\nNow she wont talk to me. Im confused, she just has to work until next week and then she can get her equipment, and even though i pointed this out to her, she is still angry. She wasn't responsible with books that weren't her property, so she has to pay the price that they gave us. My ex husband tells me i am being unreasonable, she is only 14 and shouldnt be paying for this. He says I am making her goal harder to reach by making her pay for things, especially the book fee. My sister is telling i shouldnt have made her pay the late fee, just the book fee. I dont understand why, so I am looking for an outside view.\n\nAITAH for making my 14 year old pay?", "created_utc": 1692825020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zgsvj/aitah_for_making_my_14_year_old_daughter_pay/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Libraries and late fees are a given if stuff is brought back late.\n\nAnd a 14 year old well over 5 feet tall and not even 100 lbs having to pay for food she eats? Come on. It's a need that is on a parent to provide.", "YTA. While teaching a kid the value of a dollar is among the most important things a parent can do, you're sending some very weird mixed messages here. There's a time and place for \"teaching moments\" and there's a time and place for taking responsibility.\n\nThe late fee was 100% your fault. Whether you knew about it or not, your delaying the library trip caused it. In fact, if you'd gotten a speeding ticket on the way to the library, would you have expected your daughter to pay for it? After all, you wouldn't be going to the library if it weren't for her.\n\nShe screwed up the books and was willing to face those consequences. That's exactly as it should be. You piling on to that because of your mistakes is not fair.\n\nI sympathize that you seem to be living paycheque to paycheque, but that's not anyone's fault either... and I'm a little uneasy with respect to \"she eats too much\". Be careful with all of that, or you will be adding eating disorders and psychologist bills to your list.", "Yeah YTA she\u2019s 14 and growing and you\u2019re making her pay for food. And you said yourself she\u2019s saving up for something.", "YTA. She\u2019s a child. It\u2019s fair to make her pay the original late fee. But the added fee? You were the one who couldn\u2019t get her to the library in time - you delayed her, a child who has no way of getting there herself - causing higher late fees. Now you want her to pay? You need to take some responsibility for your own actions. \n\nAlso, you make your daughter pay you for snacks she eats at your house? Seriously? Do you make your younger kids pay for snacks? She\u2019s 14, of course she\u2019s hungry, her metabolism is in overdrive. Feed your kid and don\u2019t take it out of her savings.", "You have a legal obligation to feed your underaged child. Wtf is wrong with you? Yes you are the asshole.", "41f here with a 14 year old daughter.  Yes, YTA.\n\nFirst of all cut that crap out with her eating.  The library thing was your fault.  Stop moving her goal post.  Your sister and your ex both told you the same thing as everyone here is.  I honestly don't understand how you are confused.  There are better ways to teach her than this.", "YTA. Let her keep the money she earned, she worked hard on it and it is for something she cares deeply about, and I can't think of a more effective way to build up resentment and alienate her than to casually just take her earnings when she behaves like most teenagers do. If you want to discipline her do it in a way that isn't personal and devastating to her.", "YTA\n\nA 14 year old eating a lot is NOT being \"inconsiderate.\"  They're ***growing***.  Going through puberty.  Their body is busy both building itself up to adult size, and rebuilding various internal organs from their \"child\" form to their adult form.  That takes energy and all kinds of nutrients.  Plus, she's an athlete, which means she's using even more energy.   It's your job to feed her, and your other children, adequately, at your expense, not theirs.\n\nAnd, as a parent, it is your job to support her education and training.  That includes things like equipment for extracurricular activities. Instead, you first made her work to buy needed equipment for her extracurricular sport, and then undermined her initiative when she was doing the work to save the money needed for this equipment. \"You have to earn the money for your equipment - wait, no, you can't go babysit and earn the money, because we're going on a family trip!\"\n\nAs far as the library goes, if you took her to the library after she signed the books out, but before the due date, and she failed to return them, then paying some of the fine might be appropriate - but you need to have informed her about this before sicking her with the bill.\n\nIf you let her take out books, then did not provide her with transportation to the library to return them in a timely manner, then the late bill is your fault. You owe it - a 14 year old can't just go out and go to the library on their own, unless you have one that is walking/biking distance, with a route that is safe from traffic (sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.)  \n\nShe's 14, so she's starting high school.  That means, even if it is a public school, she's going to be having more school-related expenses.  For which, as her parent, you are responsible.  She's also going to have college applications in a couple of years, and fees for things like taking the SAT, and you'll be responsible for some of the costs of college, as her parent, under the laws governing financial aid.  You need to sort out how you're going to meet these responsibilities, financially, for both her and for her siblings. \n\nAnd you get a second YTA for being so dismissive of her extracurricular sport.  She's clearly quite dedicated to this activity, and enjoys it a lot.  And all you do is gripe about the expense.  Where is your pride, as a parent, in her achievements?  Where is your love and support?  Where is the encouragement for her persistence and initiative in working on this skill?", "YTA.\n\nProviding food to your child is your most basic obligation as a parent, both morally and legally. Making a child that is so young that she is not legally allowed to work elsewhere pay for food makes you a failure as a parent.", "YTA \n\nYOU ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO FEED YOUR CHILD.  Yes, even a teen with a fast metabolism. The consumption of snacks etc because you are failing to feed her enough. Being hungry and eating a lot isnt \"inconsiderate\".  \n\nAre you paying her minimum per hour for babysitting? I bet not. My mother pulled this crap OP. Took us all to the movies. My brothers got tickets and snacks covered, I had to pay for them, etc, etc. You seem to be doing that to your daughter. It is a massive AH move. \n\nAnd the library fine was an extra 40 due to YOUR actions. YOU not having the money til your check YOU owed for babysitting YOUR kid. You should have paid the extra fine.", "There's so much wrongness in your post that it's easier to concentrate on the one thing you did right - you asked for an outside view. YTA.\n\nYou give a few examples, but they boil down to the same thing: you're moving the goalposts on your daughter. You aren't setting clear expectations for her, but rather making things up or changing things on the fly, adding to the problems instead of finding ways to help solve them, and then getting pissy when she rightly calls you out on your BS.", "YTA 5' 5.5\" and 96lb is severely underweight. You are literally starving your daughter", "YTA seek help before CPS does", "Charging a child for food is disgusting", "YTA - Actions have consequences.\n\n\"2 or 3 months ago, I got an email from our local library saying we had overdue books.

She's 14 and you are a sorry excuse for a parent.", "YTA. Wow. You don't make a child pay for food. And you should pay her more to babysit her sister. $20 to $15 per day? I'm assuming a full day, and perhaps I'm wrong, but  you should pay her at least $10 per hour", "YTA - You are making your child pay for food when she is hungry, that is part of being a parent, is taking care of your child.    \nShe isn't eating her younger siblings snacks, you aren't buying enough snacks for the \"Family\"  I get having her pay for the books she broke/misplaced, but the late fee is on you.    \nDon't penalize your daughter if you are making bad financial decisions, sounds like her acknowledging paying for the books, seems she has a pretty good head on her shoulders.  Don't make her resent you.  Apologize, and give her a weekly bonus for doing a great job, this week, enough to cover her Gymnastic equipment, she has been saving for.  Tell her you are proud of her, and for the love of god don't make her pay for food.", "YTA, and I hope you'll be willing to see where people are coming from.\n\nIt's not fair to ask a child to pay for replacement food, even if it is meant for other people such as her siblings. If she's hungry, she needs to eat, and it doesn't seem like she's selfish or inconsiderate - she's been saving up for some time, you've said she accepts that there may be consequences to actions, and she's been babysitting her sibling.\n\nBe careful you don't put her in a situation where adultification or parentification takes place. She's a child; let her enjoy as much of her childhood as possible before she has to take on all the troubles of adult life.\n\nI totally understand how money can be tight and an issue, but I'd have suggested doing something that works very well from what I've seen - tell her to save up, but pay for half of it yourself. Perhaps keep the other half she's saved and surprise her or keep it in reserve if she asks for something else in future.\n\nI say this because, although I don't know your situation, having children is a responsibility. She has a passion and hobby that is physical and active, probably involves social skills, and may well count as extracurricular and beneficial for her, long-term. She sounds like a good kid, and one any parent would be proud of.\n\nCut her some slack. And, if the late fee was actually your fault because of when you went to the library, take it on the chin and apologise. Also, be thankful you have a child who wants to read. I'd be mindful to ask why such a responsible sounding child didn't tell you she lost the books until recently - do you react with anger, have you been distracted by her older brother, is she being bullied?\n\nHope you two get back to talking again soon.", "YTA, and you become more so with every paragraph. You were already the asshole when you said that since she has been earning money, you've been making her pay for things. OK, the equipment is expensive, so getting money to pay for it makes sense. But to make her start to pay for stuff that she wouldn't have to pay for if she didn't earn money is just not right. She's your child, not a roommate.\n\nThen you mention you make her pay for *food*, and you're passing asshole territory and edging in on call to CPS territory.\n\nThen just for good measure, a final knife to your own kid, you delay doing something, it incurs additional fees, and you make her pay it. Do you hate your daughter? Do you think she is the product of an affair, and this is how you get revenge?\n\nShe should have been able to buy the equipment months ago, but you've done everything you can to drag it out. And now you are confused that she's mad?", "YTA for making your daughter pay for her food/drink that exceeds the \"limit\" that you arbitrarily decided on. Have you considered the possibility that punishing her like this could encourage a toxic relationship with food? She's still growing, and her nourishment is your responsibility.\n\nShe sounds like a very responsible young person, considering she can be entrusted to look after a 2-year-old, and is willing to pay for library books she lost.\n\nYou should pay the late fee, because it was incurred due to circumstances out of her control (ie. because you didn't take her there in time to sort it out).", "Out of curiosity, is she your oldest? Getting angry and not talking to you, eating a lot of food, etc. is gonna happen with teenagers, there's no escaping that.\n\nYTA for not owning up to the late fee. That was your fault. You're treating her like an adult, and adults don't have to wait to go to the library until their mom's check hits.", "YTA. She pays for the books, YOU pay for the fee. YOU are the adult, you should have checked if you incurred in late fees, you did not, YOU pay those fees.", "YTA - you want her to pay for food at 14????\n\nYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re teaching her responsibility then not take her to the library to pay and fine and then shirk your responsibility in accruing another fine. \n\nI don\u2019t understand what her earnings have to do with waiting for your pay cheque?

Right now her body is growing the fastest it has since she was an infant and she's involved in a phenomenally physically taxing sport. Your child is hungry and you're penalizing her for eating. It is your job to buy sufficient supplies of communal products and provide snacks of her own. If you can't afford to feed four kids, don't have four kids. And while we're on the topic of food consumption and puberty\u2014if you have a son, boy are you in for a rude awakening.\n\nThe one-week wait for her equipment is no big deal.

You\u2019re the parent and it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure she has enough to eat. Period. \n\nAnd she\u2019s right that the late fee is your fault and you should be paying it. She\u2019s paying for the cost of her mistake, you should cover the part of it you\u2019re responsible for. So YTA for that too. \n\nAnd honestly I kind of think YTA for making her care for her sibling all summer to earn the funds for her equipment because as a parent you should be helping her with her hobbies and extra curriculars. It\u2019s good she\u2019s learning the value of a dollar and to work for what she wants and I know they\u2019re expensive so I kind of get it but this feels icky to me. Especially the fact she works 3 days a week and it\u2019s taken her all summer to make $600.

She tried to find a job, but every place around us hires at 16. She earns between $10-$15, and works Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Brylee is trying to earn money to buy this piece of gymnastics equipment shes wanted for years, which is almost $600 (Jeesh!)\n\nLately, since she has been earning money, I have been making her pay for things. She has been inconsiderate and eating a lot lately. (She is 5'5.5, 96 lbs, and has a fast metabolism and is always hungry). When she eats her younger siblings snacks, or eats a lot of something that was supposed to be shared, like drinks, etc, I will make her pay for a replacement. that has kind of delyad her from getting her equipment, and because of our summer trips.\n\n2 or 3 months ago, I got an email from our local library saying we had overdue books. We went and found out Brylee had damaged a book and lost 2 others. I told her she would have to use her money to pay for them and she was sad but understood she needed consequences for her actions. I wasnt able to pay that day because I had to wait for my next paycheck. I wasnt able to go for a long time because of work, my children's activities, chores etc. Its hard being able to do things with 4 kids in the house, so i couldnt make time for the library.\n\nMonday last week, she earned enough, but I told her to wait for my next paycheck. we had just helped her brother move into college. the paycheck comes Friday. I told her we would be going to the Library this week.\n\nWe went to the library yesterday and they informed us that since it had been months, there would be a late fee. Without the fee, Brylee's total would've been $30, and she still would've had enough to buy her equipment on Friday since she had still worked the rest of the week and Monday this week. but they added a $40 fee, making the total $70 which i thought was ridiculous, but rules are rules. \n\nIn the car, Brylee was talking about how happy she was to buy her equipment. I told her with the late fee she wouldnt be able to get it until next week. Brylee got angry and said it wasnt her fault i didnt take her in time so she shouldn't have had to pay the late fee. I told her she lost the books so she has to pay the price for them. \n\nNow she wont talk to me. Im confused, she just has to work until next week and then she can get her equipment, and even though i pointed this out to her, she is still angry. She wasn't responsible with books that weren't her property, so she has to pay the price that they gave us. My ex husband tells me i am being unreasonable, she is only 14 and shouldnt be paying for this. He says I am making her goal harder to reach by making her pay for things, especially the book fee. My sister is telling i shouldnt have made her pay the late fee, just the book fee.

YTA.", "You've said you don't understand why making Brylee pay for these things makes you an asshole, so let's tackle one issue at a time.\n\nYour goal, ostensibly, is to teach your daughter about responsibility and fiscal management. How do you do this? By modeling it. Since Brylee had no way to get to the library alone, she had no way to ensure that the book fee was paid in a timely manner. Since she is a minor, that responsibility falls to you. Your excuses seem to be \"I'm busy\" (excuse me, but who isn't?) and \"I didn't know there would be a late fee\" (so you assumed the library would be totally fine waiting until you felt like coming back, if ever?) neither of which exonerates you from your responsibility to pay. Yes, you, because you were the reason the fee was not paid promptly.\n\nMaking a child pay for her own food does nothing to encourage responsibility, and everything to encourage eating disorders. From your comments, it sounds like each of your children has a basket with the same amount of snacks in it, which is kind of absurd. Fairness is all well and good, but it's a fact that your fourteen-year-old daughter needs more food than her two-year-old sister. It's on you, as a parent, to ensure she has enough to eat. You are currently failing in that regard, and she is telling you as much - she says she's hungry! - but your misplaced desire for a teachable moment is getting in the way of her getting what she needs.\n\nAt least, assuming that is your goal. From the way you talk about your paycheck, I have a feeling that your actual goal is to help lighten your costs under the guise of teaching. You might not be doing this consciously, which is why I bring it up.  I understand things are hard for single parents - my mom raised me alone, and we definitely had rough patches - but that does not mean you get to offload your responsibilities onto your children. It is still on you to make sure they are fed, and fed sufficiently. It is on you to ensure they have sufficient care. It is also on you to teach them to advocate for themselves. Right now, you are teaching Brylee that she should expect terrible treatment from what should be her safest of spaces, being absolutely exploitative in the pennies you pay her and then snatching those back to pay for your own responsibilities, her food and the late fee *you* incurred. You're showing her that she is to blame for everything that happens, even when it's not her fault.\n\nPlease do better by your daughter. I do believe this started with her best interests at heart, and that your judgement was clouded because of the difficult situation you find yourself in. You can still do better. Talk to your sister and your ex, since they sound like they're trying to advocate for Brylee, and see what you can do to ensure everyone is taken care of. And apologize to your daughter for blaming her for your mistakes. This is how you show her accountability and make it more likely she'll learn something valuable from this experience.\n\nUntil you do this, YTA.", "What is wrong with you that you were able to write this and not see that YTA?

The solution is for the parents to buy as much food as she needs to be healthy, in forms that are appropriate to her activity level and schedule.  Which may mean breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, practice time snack, then dinner.\n\nAnd even if she eats fruit and sandwiches for her snacks, it is still the responsibility of the parent, not the child, to buy enough food.
