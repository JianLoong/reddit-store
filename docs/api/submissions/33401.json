I feel like I'm losing my mind here. My husband's extended family keeps referring to our son as \"Jr\" when he is specifically \"II\" (the second).\n\nBack story: my husband was named after his paternal grandfather, but just his first name (grandfather did not have a middle name but hubby does). Let's just say it's Robert (fake name). His grandfather passed away in 2012 and he is dearly missed by the whole family. When we had our son in 2016 we decided to name him after my husband's full name, mostly to carry on  grandfather's memory. His grandmother was happy with this gesture. Her only request was to not use \"Jr.\" because then people would end up calling our little one Junior and she wasn't fond of that nickname. We agreed and went with Robert Joseph II (also fake name). And we call him Young Robert when we need to differentiate between dad and son. This is also a common thing in his family.\n\nProblem: everyone in my husband's extended family (with the exception of FIL) refers to our son as Jr. They do it in cards, Christmas ornaments, texts, every darn thing they can. We've outright corrected them \"actually, he isn't a Jr, he is II\", we've casually corrected \"Young Robert said thank you for his gift\" and nothing changes it. In the past, these same ppl have also intentionally spelled our daughter's name wrong in the same ways (they used two L's instead of one) and have flat out said \"well that's how we think it should be spelled\". Their names are special to us (she is named after hubby's paternal grandmother) and we feel like it is disrespectful to our kids and the memory of loved ones when they do this. Are we the AH for getting mad at this??\n\nNote... The people doing this are all in the boomer generation\n\nETA our son despises being called Jr or having it attached to his name. he loves that he is named after his father and great grandfather though\n\nETA #2 ppl are saying that we picked a weird/uncommon nickname of Young Robert. i totally get that but The Young Robert thing is actually a very common thing in hubby's whole family. Each household/generation has a \"young so-and-so\" named after their father. I never experienced this until i met them but have since embraced it.", "created_utc": 1703034622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mhxzg/aita_for_getting_mad_at_family_for_calling_my_son/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Junior is a nickname for the second named person in a family (typically father/son). The son and parents do not like that nickname, and ask others not to use it. They are NTA for asking others to not use it, and the ones continuing to use it are disrespectful AHs. Whether you think \u201cYoung Robert\u201d is a weird nickname is irrelevant as that\u2019s a family tradition and the son likes it.", "On the one hand: \"Junior\" means \"Younger\", so Young Robert and Robert Junior are basically the same thing.

I have also had people tell me outright that my name is \"spelled wrong\". Both these things are incredibly annoying. I am firmly in the camp of \"Just freaking call people what they want to be called, why is it such a big deal to you\".\n\nSo NTA on the basis that you are standing up for your son who keeps getting called something he doesn't want to be called. If your son liked it or didn't care, you'd be an AH, but since he doesn't like it, I fully support you.", "What matters is his opinion. If he doesn't want to be called Junior, he shouldn't be called Junior. I recommend the route of ignoring when it's used. They know he doesn't go by it so if they're saying Junior, they're clearly talking to/about someone else. NTA\n\nThere's 5 David's in my family.

I mean\u2014 your son is a junior. That\u2019s exactly what a junior is\u2014 a male with the same first, middle, and last name as his father while his father is alive. \n\nA II is typically a male named after a different male relative (like a grandfather). \n\nYou chose to take a very common naming practice and use it in an unorthodox way, and as a result, everyone is messing it up. \n\nThis was easily foreseeable. Then you picked a nickname\u2014 Young Robert, which is very awkward and unlikely to catch on. \n\nOn the other hand\u2014 these are relatives and they should\u2019ve caught on by now being that the kid is 7. So they suck too. \n\nBut people are going to assume your kid is a Jr. his whole life\u2014 because he kind of is. So I\u2019d figure out a way to not be offended by it.", "NTA even the son gets mad at being called Jr. what he wants is what matters here.

You made him a Jr, people are gonna call him that.", "Maybe I'm not understanding but this seems like an overblown issue. I may have missed where you said how old your son is, but unless he's an adult, why not just call him \"Robert\" and let people infer from context who you're talking about? Unless they're sitting in the same room and you need to call one of them over or something, I feel like this would be pretty easy rather than perpetually adding the word \"young\" to his name? \"Robert (dad) did XYZ at work\". \"Robert (son) got an A on his math test\". Even the gift thing you mentioned - \"Robert says thanks for the (whatever gift was)\". All pretty easily figured out just by context. \n\nI think technically, if he's named after his father, he would be a \"jr\". If he was named after the grandfather, but his father had a different name, he would be \"II\". Could be wrong about that, but either way, it seems like it could be \"solved\" by just using his first name (or whatever iteration of that, if he prefers - Rob, Bobby, etc.) \n\nNTA but seems like a somewhat easily solved problem to me by just using his first name", "You gave him someone else\u2019s name instead of his own, he\u2019ll always be a Jr.\n\n\u201cThe second\u201d is just as pretentious and annoying", "YTA-Full disclosure I judge anyone who names their kid completely after the dad.

Grandmother made a reasonable request, as far as you and husband are concerned, and that\u2019s all that matters in this situation. The family members that can\u2019t be bothered to call your son the correct name (this goes for nicknames as well) are the same type of people who will purposefully deadname people as well. They get a kick out of trying to force others to bend to their will.

Let Young Robert Jr the II decide what he wants to be called", "YTA. You are correct that\"Jr.\" And \"II\" are different, but most often, they are used interchangeably in commone usage. Furthermore, you technically used \"II\" wrong. \"II\" is traditionally used when a male child is named after a male relative that is not the child's father. And, while you chose that name to honour his grandfather, you named him explicitly after his father. Not that any of this matters, but since you were being so pedantic about it, it felt important to note.\n\nEdit: By those same rules \"Young Robert\" is ironically a \"Jr.\"\n\nEdit: If \"Young Robert\" truly doesn't like being called \"Jr.\" then NTA.", "YTA you guys are just stupid", "YTA. It\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t want to call him junior. I think it\u2019s dumb when people do that too. \n\nBut, he is technically a junior. That\u2019s how it works. \n\nII and junior are interchangeable. If you didn\u2019t like junior, you should have given your son the exact same name as his father and, you know, made him a junior.", "He is a Jr, they are not wrong in calling him such. Calling him II brings to mind Carlton on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Are you hoping your son will dress in bow ties, oxford loafers and carry a briefcase in elementary school?\n\nWhile I can understand great-grandma's sentiment, it's just not realistic. When he's older he can determine whether to be Jr or II. It also depends on what career he goes into. How many venture capitalist have you know as Jr? Now, how many II or III? And vice-versa, how many construction workers do you know as II? How many as Jr?\n\nYes, YTA because apparently neither you nor your husband understand that your son is in fact...a Jr.", "YTAJr and II are synonyms if the son is the II  \nand besides its not a big deal", "Esh you literally named him the same name as his dad. THATS a junior.  Why didn't you just flip flop the names??\n\nHowever, your son doesn't like being called junior, and it's his name, so *his* preference takes front point.", "Start calling him Segundus.", "YTA \n\nIt's a nickname. It's not hurtful or bad. Especially given that the kid's actual name includes a word functionally similar to the nickname, it's a really odd objection.", "YTA only because Jr and II are the same thing.

Also people call kids who aren't named after anyone Junior all the time! Also, \"Young Robert\" is a stupid mouthful. Unless your kid is unhappy with the name you should chill (and if he is you should put that in the post because it's the only important piece of information for this post. Nothing else matters except how he feels about his name) \n\nBut to deliberately misspell your daughter's name is ridiculous and rude.", "Sorry to say - but with your son, you set yourself up for problems. And with your daughter's name - if you went against a common/expected spelling - then you also set yourself up for problems.  \n\nMy husband is a Junior and I absolutely REFUSED to have a child named after him.  My father was a Jr and on the day he died (in his early 60s - 25 years after his father's death) his aunts were still calling him Jr.  The man had a fricking PdD - but he was still \"Jr\" to them.     And I had an uncle/cousin who were Sr/Jr - but they were always referred to as Big John and Little John.  To this day, I STILL refer to my cousin as Little John - even though he is 6'4\" and a Lt Col in the Army.  So - I just refused to go down that road.  Thankfully, my husband agreed. \n\nWe ended up choosing 1 name that we liked from his family and 1 name that we liked from my family.  Yeah - we had to go back a few generations to find good names (OMG - some of those names were just horrid) - but we were very happy with our choices.", "Okay - to me, there is a distinction between Jr and II.   Note - all names mentioned are made up.\n\nFor me \"Junior\" represent an immediate (father/son) relationship. So father is John Jay Jones and son is John Jay Jones.  Father becomes Sr and son becomes Jr.   And using \"II\" represents a non-father/son relationship.  So maybe grandfather is John Jay Jones, father is John David Jones, and son is John Jay Jones.  In this case, the use of \"II\" for the son refers to that name commonality between grandfather and grandson.\n\nNow...let me share a story.  I have a friend who was adopted as an infant.  His adoptive father was William David Smith.  So the adoptive father and mother named my friend William David Smith II.  To them, this connected the father and son - but also kept a bit of distance (because my friend was adopted).  Frankly, I thought their decision was awful - but can't go back 60+ years.\n\nSo.....my friend's parents divorced and the father remarried a MUCH younger woman.  They then had a son that they named William David Smith, Jr!!!!!  Then, this new son (the Jr) goes to the same high school that my friend graduated from (Catholic - everyone knows everybody), and as it happens, this young man is of the right age to be my friend's son.  So the school (long-time teachers/admins + his friends who are now parents) all think this is my friend's son.   OOPS!  As it happens - my friend has 3 daughters, so this further confuses things.\n\nThis is a potential mess when it comes to identity issues. Thankfully, my friend is a lawyer and is working to minimize potential damage.  Oh - and he barely knows this young man with the same name.  They aren't biologically related in any way - so the father has done his best to keep them a part.\n\nPSA -Parents - PLEASE!!!!!   Consider the future consequences of names!!!!!!!", "YTA", "The Filipino part of my extended family called a step grandson Junior because he was so much like the elder gentleman. It fit, and it was great. Gentle YTA.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going a bit against the grain here. First, he is literally junior as others have said, so that\u2019s a very natural nickname - especially for his father\u2019s side since that\u2019s how they see him - a child version of his dad - given the name you chose. And relatives LOVE saying junior as you\u2019re passing down the father\u2019s name - quite the honor!\n\nYes, disrespectful and annoying, but also extremely predictable when you named him after his dad. Sorry, but you did kinda ask for that one.\n\nI\u2019m just not sure this is a hill to die on unless you\u2019re very frequently interacting with your extended family or it REALLY angers your kid. I suspect it angers you far more than the kids though unless you\u2019ve passed that onto them.\n\nI only say that because I was named after my father, but they gave me a rather annoying nickname to differentiate us. I never really liked it, but I only saw my relatives a few times a year so sucked it up. As I got older, I was MUCH more vocal about not wanting to use that name. No one cared by that point so I stopped pressing for it. Now, a few older folks still call me that 30+ years later, but it makes me more sad than upset as it shows how little they\u2019ve been a part of my adult life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I definitely support him if he chooses his own version of his name to go by. Right now it is what it is but I'm sure as he grows into his own that might change and momma bear will support him 100%", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc If it was honestly just us being insulted as parents I would let it slide, but seeing him unhappy is the really upsetting part", "I wondered this because Young Robert is what 7/8? How much could this possibly really bother him. I\u2019d understand if as a young man this continues and at that point it\u2019s for him to express to others if it bothers him. But at 7 how many cards and custom ornaments is he exposed to that this causes a fuss? I completely appreciate it\u2019s bothering the parents but as others have said it\u2019s difficult to enforce a nickname which goes against the standard. That being he\u2019s technically a jnr. Id just accept it is what it is. OP is NTA but you would be if you can\u2019t just let this roll off your back, fear you could become TA. As Robert becomes a young man and comes into his own identity he\u2019ll no doubt make it clear to all what he wishes to be known as. My brother, dad and grandfather all had the same first name but different middle names and each went by a diff version of the name and this differs between who\u2019s addressing them. Eg. Rob, Robbie, bob, Bobby. My brother\u2019s Bobby at home but chose Robbie with his friends. My dads Robert to my mums family but goes by his middle name with his. And my grandad went by the family name initial with friends and family but Robert to outsiders.", "I am getting the sense that we are outnumbered on our view of the situation for sure", "I was about 6 when I started rebeling against my name. Everyone in my family was devastated I didn't want to keep the classic Elizabeth, my mom fought me on it the longest. Sometimes kids have personal opinions without parental influence.", "Give it a couple hours (up to a day) for the normal people to find this post, and that will change, hopefully. If not, wait two days and post again, and you\u2019ll get the exact opposite response. Reddit is fucked.", "I was 5-6 when I told my dad I wanted my moms last name because my mom and uncles were tougher then him. I actually refused to get in family photos when they were married because she was changing her name to his. (Stupid I know, I was like 6)\n\nAnd now one of those uncles is in prison and the other passed away, and everyone who knows me. They call me by my father\u2019s last name. My first name rarely gets used. \n\nAnd for whatever reason, my 2 boys. Their friends call them by my father\u2019s last name as well. One of them is a Jr. and the other has a wildly popular first name, they just grew up with me being called by my last name and followed suit.", "That's the truth!"]}
