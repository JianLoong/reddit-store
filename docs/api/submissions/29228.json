He has some \"alpha male\" logic going on in his brain. \n\nYou know, it's kind of true. Every relationship has a leader. The part that is wrong is when people assume that the \"leader\" or \"provider\" or \"alpha\" of the relationship has to be the man. \n\nThese words aren't synonymous. He has conflated being a provider with being an alpha (still gross to say it like that). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>because of this he thinks it's fair I pay for most things.\n\nThis is also another point against him. It's not bad that he makes less than you. There's always going to be someone in the relationship that earns less. What's weird is he wants you to pay for these extravagant things, then give him the credit. He wants to have fun and enjoy himself and look good to his friends. \n\nThis guy just sounds like bad news all around. He's illogical and childish and prideful. \n\nAnd for what it's worth? There are plenty of men out there who can earn less than their partners and not feel emasculated. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If he wanted to lie about that, he should have talked to you. So you wouldn't let something slip. Also it seems like a big red flag, that he wants to live on your money but still tells his friends he pays for everything, so he doesn't look poor (?).", "\u201cI made him look like a beta\u201d. NTA, but Girl run.\n\nThis guy wants to use your money, and then goes around telling people that you\u2019re the one using his money. He wants the praise, but wants you to put in the work, and when people find out his reaction is to degrade you using disgusting Tate-language and insisting you are the problem while also insisting you keep paying his way. \n\nYou need to get out of this relationship. Ask yourself if you really want a future where you pay for everything, do all the work, and he still gets all of the praise, just so he can feel like an \u201calpha\u201d.\nIf he wants to be an \u201calpha\u201d then he can start by paying for his own vacation, and stop leeching off of you!", "Sorry but why would his friends think he was able to take care of you if they knew his job?", "He has no problems taking credit for your hard work....he is the beta", "NTA\n\nThat was very immature of him and anyone with a brain could figure out that a NP makes more than a barista. I have nothing against wage gaps and would actually be thrilled if my SO made more than I do lol. \n\nBut his false narrative/house of cards is something he build himself. A foundation that undermined your hard work and efforts. He should be proud of you... not embarrassed. So, when the truth came out... he embarrassed himself... not the other way around. \n\nNo SO should be willing to make up scenarios that benefit only themselves. He should have been secure and honest. You make more than him... ok... but you are with HIM because you like him. You spend time and resources WITH him because you like HIM. There is nothing more valuable to a man than a woman who loves him and is willing to share what they have to offer. \n\nUnfortunately, his actions were childish: before, during, and after. Blaming you for his lies is very foretelling.", "NTA. It's your boyfriend's dishonesty and ego that caused his embarrassment.", "I appreciate all the comments. I have a lot to think about apparently. Thank you to everyone who chimed in and opened my eyes.", "NTA. Not that anyone with any intelligence still buys into the alpha/beta male nonsense, but indulging it for a moment, you didn't make him \\*look\\* like a beta. He simply \\*is\\* one by his own standards because he cannot afford to take care of you. That's his problem. If he's that insecure about his earnings and that concerned with appearing as though he can take care of you, then he'd better be working his ass off to advance himself so that he actually can one day. Otherwise, he's just going to constantly diminish you to feel better about himself. You worked hard for your career and can pay for stuff. You have a right to be proud of that.", "NTA, he's willing to make it look like he 'takes care of you' but not willing to actually do it. You've got to question how much he lies about about if he can lie that easily to his friends.", "Okay so this is one of the cases where I say, please OP do re-think the relationship. Even if you love your BF, not only is he kinda okay with exploiting you, but well you comply voluntarily But he is very very much insecure. He gets aggressive when he feels embarrassed and he blames you for his own incompetence. \n\nNone of those is going away, those are unfortunately his personality traits and he is not the youngest, it'll probably only get more in his head. Do you really see your whole future together spent with you tip-toeing around his ego and him getting angry at the most basic reactions of yours?  You would what? learn to comply to keep peace? Learn to smile and nod when he lies about his \"alpha\" role in the relationship (apparently equivalent to being a breadwinner in his eyes)... \n\nJust reconsider, please.", "Um, he could have avoided the whole mess by not lying in the first place. People that take credit for other people's actions are insecure muppets.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
