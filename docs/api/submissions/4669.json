A new girl started earlier this year (18F, May), she is a college student. She is asian american, her family came from Taiwan. I think she is really smart and good at her job. I have been acting as her supervisor because I am the oldest and most experienced waitress in this place.\n\nA group of old chinese men wearing fancy suits and expensive watches started coming to our restaurant weekly two moths ago, apparently they all work in a bank nearby. They come every friday for lunch and always order pan-roasted chicken with lemon/garlic sauce along with oven roasted potatoes. May was their waitress the first time and they seemed really happy with her. They sometimes talked to her in chinese but she told me she didn't really understand what they were saying besides very general lines. They always left and absurdly high tip for her, that is later divided alongside the other tips for all of us. The second time they came, I went to take their order but they asked for May to do it instead, I assumed it was for the language issue althought they seem to speak english fine. She has been their only waitress since then.\n\nLast friday, after they left, May told me she didn't want to serve them anymore. She explained that the guys were acting weird and start telling her stuff in chinese she didn't understand but at one point she was pretty sure they called her a slut. I explained to her that was not enough for the restaurant to take any action and that we can't risk to alienate loyal costumers like them by such flimsy reasons. I told her to stay alert and if this happens again or escalates in any way, I will intervene personally. She wasn't happy about that and acted distant all weekend. I understand her being annoyed but I am just doing my job.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670972514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl9yoy/aita_for_wanting_a_waitress_to_keep_serving_a/", "score": 683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If someone is alienated bc you told them they can't harass wait staff, you don't want them in your establishment anyway. I hope she quits, you don't deserve a good employee like that.", "YTA.

Act like one.", "YTA\n\n> They always left and absurdly high tip for her, that is later divided alongside the other tips for all of us.\n\nYeah, try and be less obvious with your motivations.", "YTA. She was sexually harassed, and you're telling her to just suck it up???", "YTA \n\nSo having big tip is more important than dignity? I hope May can find another less toxic job. You can serve those sexist AH yourself.", "YTA\n\n> I explained to her that was not enough for the restaurant to take any action\n\nDoes she have to be physically sexually assaulted before y'all step in?? They made lewd comments about an employee who went to a boss and said \"That makes me uncomfortable\".  It shouldn't take any more than that.", "YTA.\n\nYOU were obviously using and exploiting her for that tip. You know she is a waitress not an escort. In retail the customer is always right until they harass staff.", "You're a woman and a waitress. You really telling me you think we don't know when people are acting skeezy towards us even if we don't 100% understand every word? \n\nCos if you are, I don't believe you. \n\nYou know full well what this is, and you know they're being gross. And so does May.\n\nLater is not the time for you to 'intervene personally'.\n\nMay has good reason not to want to serve them anymore and you need to have her back on this instead of expecting your staff member to put up with getting disrepected because you get a cut of the big tip. \n\nYou're not a pimp, so don't act like one.\n\nYTA", "She is uncomfortable and upset because she was sexually harassed at her job, but you want her to stay in that environment and  continue to face harassment so that YOU can get some of her tip money.

She's not asking you to ban these guys, she's asking not to be the one to serve them. It's clear this isn't a language issue since they were coming there before she started and had no problem ordering. And it's not that they've developed a close relationship with her because she is being made uncomfortable by them. It doesn't sound like May is the only waitstaff available. So all you have to say is May is not available to serve them. Their preference should not take precedence over her comfort. And honestly I feel like anyone making a fuss over who their wait staff is when there isn't a preexisting relationship is far more likely to be doing something to make that staff uncomfortable rather than not. The customer is not always right and disregarding employees' (especially good hardworking employees) feelings like this is how you lose them. \n\nHonestly it kind of comes across like you are more concerned about losing your share of the bigger tip they leave than you are about whether or not your coworker is being harassed. Which is an a-hole move.", "YTA - Jeez. Are we still here?\n\nYou need to look after your staff, treat them with respect and demand that your customers do to.\n\nIf I, as a customer, overheard you saying this to your staff member, not only would I not come back, I would tell everyone who would listen about the way you treat your staff.\n\nYour team are an investment. The service in your restaurant is just as important as the food and if you fail to protect your staff against sexual harassment, why should they stay in the job or do more than the absolute bare minimum for you?\n\nYou *can* and *should* do something about it - you can ask the group mistreating your staff not to return. You can have some principles and be a good manager.", "YTA. Even if she did misunderstand what they said, she now feels very vulnerable and uncomfortable around them. I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't the first little comment or whatever microaggression from them - for many women, especially in service, they will put up with a bit before they ask management for help.  Don't make her stay feeling that way. You can find some polite way to deal with it with the customers if needs be - make an excuse why she can't serve them 'oh, she's super busy in her section' or whatever.", "YTA\n\nYou're not actually her supervisor, just \"acting\" as one, right? \n\nYour only advice should be for her to report the harassment to an *actual* manager. \n\nIt isn't your place to decide if something is harassment or not, and it's **certainly** not your place to dismiss her  claims so you can profit from her tips.", "*She wasn't happy about that and acted distant all weekend. I understand her being annoyed but I am just doing my job.*\n\nNo, you're focused on the tips she brings in. You're not concerned that she feels highly uncomfortable with these people now. At the end of the day, everybody should feel like they work in an environment where they feel comfortable. At any point if something happens to which someone is now uncomfortable, something needs to be done to rectify the situation. \n\nYou can easily have another waitress; waiter take care of this group. What you want her to do is suck it up because they like having her as a server, and they tip her good which in turn makes everyone's tips a bit better.\n\nShe has already addressed the problem with you and asked not to be their server anymore. She was honest and spoke up. You tell her the restaurant can't risk alienating loyal customers but if it happens again, that you will intervene.

I never had to serve someone who sexually harassed me. The few places where my managers didn't care,  the place also struggled to keep employees. \n\nYou're responsible for her, that also means for backing her up. This is harming her mental health and her self-esteem. Also, it could possibly be dangerous to that point that they try any moves on her or whatsoever. Protect your employees, don't exploit them.", "YTA she shouldn't be forced to be uncomfortable just because you clearly don't care about her feelings. Why don't you just take the table instead?", "Oof yikes. YTA\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if she quits without notice. You\u2019ve basically told her that these customers are more important than her being treated with baseline respect at work. I haven\u2019t worked in food/bev service, but I have worked and managed in commission retail sales. The moment ANY of my salespeople said they felt uncomfortable with a customer I took over the sale no questions asked. As a salesperson I split the commission if the salesperson already started working with them and stepped away, and as a manager I gave the entire sale to the original salesperson.  It\u2019s like the simplest thing to do to show respect and teamwork to your coworker and it ensures that someone is willing step in and help *you* when you need it.", "YTA\n\nThere should have been nothing past her saying she was uncomfortable serving them.

Wow, your JOB is protecting employees from harassment. She came to you and said she felt harassed and you dismissed her because you want a share of the tips they leave. \n\nHow you should of handled the situation was by telling May she doesn't have to wait on them anymore and you will.

It is, evidently, a somewhat obsolete term that has fallen out of favor.  It is quite possible that the customers were calling her, \"Miss\" with no ill-intent whatsoever.

A new girl started earlier this year (18F, May), she is a college student. She is asian american, her family came from Taiwan. I think she is really smart and good at her job. I have been acting as her supervisor because I am the oldest and most experienced waitress in this place.\n\nA group of old chinese men wearing fancy suits and expensive watches started coming to our restaurant weekly two moths ago, apparently they all work in a bank nearby. They come every friday for lunch and always order pan-roasted chicken with lemon/garlic sauce along with oven roasted potatoes. May was their waitress the first time and they seemed really happy with her. They sometimes talked to her in chinese but she told me she didn't really understand what they were saying besides very general lines. They always left and absurdly high tip for her, that is later divided alongside the other tips for all of us. The second time they came, I went to take their order but they asked for May to do it instead, I assumed it was for the language issue althought they seem to speak english fine. She has been their only waitress since then.\n\nLast friday, after they left, May told me she didn't want to serve them anymore. She explained that the guys were acting weird and start telling her stuff in chinese she didn't understand but at one point she was pretty sure they called her a slut. I explained to her that was not enough for the restaurant to take any action and that we can't risk to alienate loyal costumers like them by such flimsy reasons. I told her to stay alert and if this happens again or escalates in any way, I will intervene personally. She wasn't happy about that and acted distant all weekend. I understand her being annoyed but I am just doing my job.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
