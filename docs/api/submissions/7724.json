It's not ok to weaponize his trauma against you.  Marriage can not be a transactional thing,  but he needs to contribute. If he legitimately has issues,  then while he works on those, he can find another way to help. \n\nIf you stay,  prepare yourself for similar circumstances.   Before long, he'll stop organizing because his dad would call him names,  or he'll stop taking the trash because an ex made him feel like trash. \n\nIf the burden is slowly shifting your way and he's stated that he had no intention of balancing...... then he doesn't really love you.  You're just his favorite person who isn't himself.", "Quit cooking stuff. On your way home from work, stop off for a quick bite and when you get home you don\u2019t even mention dinner. If he asks tell him you can\u2019t since the dishwasher has quit and it is too stressful to cook until the dishes are washed.  Don\u2019t mention that you ate.", "NTA\n\nIt's ok for him to say he doesn't want to do dishes because it is the one chore he hates due to being forced to do it as a kid.\n\nIt's ok if he's not doing a chore because he genuinely doesn't know or understand it needs doing. Eg not everyone agrees how often you need to wash the bed linen or how dirty the floor needs to be before it needs cleaning.\n\nBut\n\nIt's not ok to avoid dishes if he's not substituting with something else, and more generally if he's not doing his fair share of the chores.\n\nIt's not ok to avoid a chore after it's been agreed with your partner what a chore is, ie you can't keep claiming you don't know it needs doing once it's been pointed out it needs doing. Plus in this case it's hard not to realise dishes need cleaning - it's not like dusting or ironing where there's a subjective opinion on how often it needs doing.\n\nAnd what's a \"fair share\" - would often be 50% but really depends on context. If someone works 55hrs compared to the other 35hrs because they both need the money and both benefit from it, then the one with less work needs to do more chores. But 35hrs is full-time employment, so if the one doing 55hrs is choosing to do that without the other encouraging them or saying they need the extra income, then they're effectively choosing a (probably unhealthy) amount of work of their own choice and that shouldn't stop their need to do chores any more than someone choosing to play games with their time beyond a normal working week. Or if one partner is ill or physically or mentally unable to do as many tasks, then their fair share might not be 50%. Or if one of you is also caring for a parent they might do less.\n\nI would suggest if he really doesn't want to do dishes, then switch it, preferably for something you don't like yourself, eg you do dishes but he could do the cooking, the food shopping, the dusting, the clothes washing, cleaning the kitchen or bathroom, sweeping/vacuuming the floors, gardening, diy, etc. Agree which tasks you each do, and what frequency is acceptable, and then you can better insist on him doing them.", "NTA find a better husband, find better friends", "Nope definitely NTA.

I prefer to use the dish washer (which I still take the time to load and then put dishes away).
