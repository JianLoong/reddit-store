Its been great but one major issue we keep having is the dishes.\nNow I don't want to play the sympathy card but recently I've been working 55 hour weeks while he's only working 35 to 40. I know it doesn't seem like much but most nights I come home exhausted or sick from something I picked up at work to make dinner and run the budget things like that, and when I come home he is playing guitar, video games or watching TV.\nWhen we first moved in together we had an agreement that if I cook he'll do dishes but recently its been all on me to cook, to do dishes to clean the entire kitchen while he does the bare minimum. Yes he can organise things and take out bins once or twice a week but it is still not enough.\n\nI brought it up recently that I'm feeling overwhelmed and he told me that me asking him to do the dishes every day annoys him since his mum used to volunteer him to do dishes when he lived with her and nagged him for hours on end until it was done. She also cut off his bedroom eletric if he didn't do dishes. He said he feels he chips in more than enough.\n\nI told him he's a grown man with his own house and if he's not willing to share chores then I'll stop doing my part and he'll see how much I actually do compared to him.\nSo I've stopped doing dishes. \n3 days in and the sink is full and the kitchen stinks. \nApparently it makes me the asshole according to him and our friends but I feel like I need to stand my ground.\n\nAm I the problem?\n\n\n\nEdit...

It's not ok to weaponize his trauma against you.  Marriage can not be a transactional thing,  but he needs to contribute. If he legitimately has issues,  then while he works on those, he can find another way to help. \n\nIf you stay,  prepare yourself for similar circumstances.   Before long, he'll stop organizing because his dad would call him names,  or he'll stop taking the trash because an ex made him feel like trash. \n\nIf the burden is slowly shifting your way and he's stated that he had no intention of balancing...... then he doesn't really love you.  You're just his favorite person who isn't himself.", "Quit cooking stuff. On your way home from work, stop off for a quick bite and when you get home you don\u2019t even mention dinner. If he asks tell him you can\u2019t since the dishwasher has quit and it is too stressful to cook until the dishes are washed.  Don\u2019t mention that you ate.", "NTA\n\nIt's ok for him to say he doesn't want to do dishes because it is the one chore he hates due to being forced to do it as a kid.\n\nIt's ok if he's not doing a chore because he genuinely doesn't know or understand it needs doing. Eg not everyone agrees how often you need to wash the bed linen or how dirty the floor needs to be before it needs cleaning.\n\nBut\n\nIt's not ok to avoid dishes if he's not substituting with something else, and more generally if he's not doing his fair share of the chores.\n\nIt's not ok to avoid a chore after it's been agreed with your partner what a chore is, ie you can't keep claiming you don't know it needs doing once it's been pointed out it needs doing. Plus in this case it's hard not to realise dishes need cleaning - it's not like dusting or ironing where there's a subjective opinion on how often it needs doing.\n\nAnd what's a \"fair share\" - would often be 50% but really depends on context. If someone works 55hrs compared to the other 35hrs because they both need the money and both benefit from it, then the one with less work needs to do more chores. But 35hrs is full-time employment, so if the one doing 55hrs is choosing to do that without the other encouraging them or saying they need the extra income, then they're effectively choosing a (probably unhealthy) amount of work of their own choice and that shouldn't stop their need to do chores any more than someone choosing to play games with their time beyond a normal working week. Or if one partner is ill or physically or mentally unable to do as many tasks, then their fair share might not be 50%. Or if one of you is also caring for a parent they might do less.\n\nI would suggest if he really doesn't want to do dishes, then switch it, preferably for something you don't like yourself, eg you do dishes but he could do the cooking, the food shopping, the dusting, the clothes washing, cleaning the kitchen or bathroom, sweeping/vacuuming the floors, gardening, diy, etc. Agree which tasks you each do, and what frequency is acceptable, and then you can better insist on him doing them.", "NTA find a better husband, find better friends", "Nope definitely NTA.

I would come home every day exhausted and he\u2019d be playing Xbox. Even couples therapy didn\u2019t work because he was too self-centered to see why those things were so important. Or he\u2019d start actually doing what he had committed to do in our premarital counseling, just to go back to being lazy and useless within a few weeks. Over the years disappointment turned to anger turned to resentment, turned to disdain. Best thing I ever did was divorcing that man. I just wish I had done it sooner.", "I have no idea...", ">She should just stop cooking since the kitchen is in no condition for cooking. Grab takeout for herself on the way home. If he refuses to do dishes, she can\u2019t cook. End of story.\n\nI did that with my old roommate, who had the exact same situation as OP and her husband.

They shared the same outdoorsy hobbies and he seemed great. \n\n>After they married... he put on several hundred pounds, no longer cleaned up their home. No longer made anything. He quit his job out of the blue after she became a nurse practitioner. He constantly disses and puts her down whenever he can.\n\nThis genuinely reminds me of those rainforest birds with their elaborate mating dances.

Best wishes for the future.", "You know how at work and school, you might meet someone who puts more effort into being lazy versus actually doing the work?\n\nPeople can totally do that with their own mental and emotional issues.\n\nI knew a woman whose husband (now her ex obvi) hid serious drinking and cheating problems from her *for years.* This included money going out the window to afford the multiple and constant affairs.

What tasks are there he has to do repeatedly which he hates but are useful? If he is a car mechanic, he probably has a place for his tools. He takes the tools he needs for the specific repair of a car out. Once he's done, he puts the tools back. Maybe he hates this task, but he does it as it helps him find the proper tools for the next repair.\n\nAlso, if he ever read any book or article about efficiency, he should have heard of the advise 'If something takes 2 minutes or less to do, just do it'. Applied to the dishes, if he puts the glass by the sink, he or his wife has to pick it up later to either wash it or put it in the dishwasher. That's not efficient. It is better to either wash it directly or to just put it in the dishwasher.\n\nSo, even if you don't just do it in respect of your wife, it is just the logical thing to do.", "You really think her husband is going to respect her leftovers?

That and having like 3-4 half full glasses in different rooms because you can't be bothered to clean up after yourself. Both my wife and daughter will have multiple glasses with drinks in them, sometime 2-3 in the same room. So frustrating... especially when I do the dishes without checking the other rooms, and miss half a dozen glasses that needed cleaning (admittedly, **I** didn't check for the glasses before doing dishes, but it still makes me angry)", "Okay, that makes sense, I read it as \u201cWell, if you have vaccines, the sickness won\u2019t be a problem\u201d", "If you\u2019re at this point in the relationship, why are you even staying?", "It happened to me around housework as a kid.

They bought a fixer-upper with the agreement that she would pay the mortgage and utilities while he did the \u201cfixer-uppering\u201d and finished college. He seemed like such a perfect guy to all of us until they got that house. They started working on the house last January by gutting the only bathroom to redo it. She moved out 10 months later when he had accomplished very little and she still has no place to bathe. Well, that isn\u2019t entirely true. There is a laundry room sink in the basement (that you have walk down into the garage to get to) where she could clean herself with a washcloth. It is a disaster because she\u2019s on the mortgage and he\u2019s in he house.

One night after dinner I politely asked him (again for the millionth time) to stop doing that and please just put it in the dishwasher. He yelled at me \"why should I, I made dinner\". Let me be clear here, he made dinner, yes, but I cleaned up his mess from cooking, unloaded and reloaded the dishwasher and set the table. And over the 15 years I have cooked, cleaned, set and un-set the table on my own, and we have 3 kids to boot. This triggered me, and that was enough - I'm done.

Seems like a bad risk/reward ratio given that you risk them leaving you and you having to start all over with someone else. \n\nIf you aren't actually a good person, but you can fake it, *just keep faking it*.
