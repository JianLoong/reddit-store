It's not ok to weaponize his trauma against you.  Marriage can not be a transactional thing,  but he needs to contribute. If he legitimately has issues,  then while he works on those, he can find another way to help. \n\nIf you stay,  prepare yourself for similar circumstances.   Before long, he'll stop organizing because his dad would call him names,  or he'll stop taking the trash because an ex made him feel like trash. \n\nIf the burden is slowly shifting your way and he's stated that he had no intention of balancing...... then he doesn't really love you.  You're just his favorite person who isn't himself.", "Quit cooking stuff. On your way home from work, stop off for a quick bite and when you get home you don\u2019t even mention dinner. If he asks tell him you can\u2019t since the dishwasher has quit and it is too stressful to cook until the dishes are washed.  Don\u2019t mention that you ate.", "NTA\n\nIt's ok for him to say he doesn't want to do dishes because it is the one chore he hates due to being forced to do it as a kid.\n\nIt's ok if he's not doing a chore because he genuinely doesn't know or understand it needs doing. Eg not everyone agrees how often you need to wash the bed linen or how dirty the floor needs to be before it needs cleaning.\n\nBut\n\nIt's not ok to avoid dishes if he's not substituting with something else, and more generally if he's not doing his fair share of the chores.\n\nIt's not ok to avoid a chore after it's been agreed with your partner what a chore is, ie you can't keep claiming you don't know it needs doing once it's been pointed out it needs doing. Plus in this case it's hard not to realise dishes need cleaning - it's not like dusting or ironing where there's a subjective opinion on how often it needs doing.\n\nAnd what's a \"fair share\" - would often be 50% but really depends on context. If someone works 55hrs compared to the other 35hrs because they both need the money and both benefit from it, then the one with less work needs to do more chores. But 35hrs is full-time employment, so if the one doing 55hrs is choosing to do that without the other encouraging them or saying they need the extra income, then they're effectively choosing a (probably unhealthy) amount of work of their own choice and that shouldn't stop their need to do chores any more than someone choosing to play games with their time beyond a normal working week. Or if one partner is ill or physically or mentally unable to do as many tasks, then their fair share might not be 50%. Or if one of you is also caring for a parent they might do less.\n\nI would suggest if he really doesn't want to do dishes, then switch it, preferably for something you don't like yourself, eg you do dishes but he could do the cooking, the food shopping, the dusting, the clothes washing, cleaning the kitchen or bathroom, sweeping/vacuuming the floors, gardening, diy, etc. Agree which tasks you each do, and what frequency is acceptable, and then you can better insist on him doing them.", "NTA find a better husband, find better friends", "Nope definitely NTA.

Sadly, he's absorbed some traditionally masculine beliefs about chores and household upkeep. Ignore the people saying this is a deal breaker. You're both young and still learning how to live with someone else. There is a LOT of learning and growth that happens at this stage of life. It should only be a deal-breaker if he refuses to learn and grow with you. \n\nSit down and have an honest conversation with him and ask if he thinks it's okay for you to work extra long shifts and do the cooking and cleaning while he plays video games. If he's even a halfway decent human being, he'll recognize that is not okay or fair to you. So work with him on a solution. Get him to suggest ideas so he feels more invested in the solution.\n\nChores do not have to be exactly 50/50, but they should be equitable. If one person is working longer or sick or going through something, the other one should step up and do more. And if the situation changes, so should the division of labor. But maybe look at what types of chores you each naturally tend towards. Maybe he cooks and you do dishes. Maybe you do both of those things, but he does laundry and some other chore you don't enjoy. It's trial and error and finding balance, but above all else, he needs to not act like you're his mother - that is neither acceptable nor sustainable.", "I like this plan! OP should cook and clean only for herself.", "He knows no woman wants to be compared to his mom. So he is doing it to shut her up", ">But this is exactly why people should live together before marriage. You find this stuff out much sooner.\n\nThe problem with this is that many men only bust out their weaponized incompetence issues AFTER the ceremony.", "Counter point - my (young!) Children appear to do more around the house than this guy! Admittedly I do need to sometimes nag them \ud83d\ude05", "Good for her, birthing a fully formed adult would've been hell on the body.", ">He doesn\u2019t want to be an adult or a team player. He wants you to be his new mummy that looks after him but doesn\u2019t give him chores to do\n\nI think the term used her is \"bang maid\"", "It was his mother's parenting which led to this behaviour, come on now.", "This. Or maybe ask him to cook \\[a decent meal\\] then you do the dishes? Lets see what he prefers.", "No.\n\nAlternate cooking and washing or he'll offer to cook, use every pot in the kitchen, and leave hella mess. Also, idk op, but a lot of us clean as we cook, so just what we ate on and served from is dirty afterwards.", "I work with children. They bring every bug known to man in. Had a kid in 2 weeks ago with rubella and 5 staff members caught it from them.", "That's where the whole \"men change after marriage\" thing comes from. Which was why I didn't believe in marriage for a long time. \n\nThese guys can put on this romantic front for over 2 years. Then they let their mask fall. Happened to a couple of my friends. With one guy he wined and dined her, constantly cooking meals, constantly going on dinner dates with her and all her friends. They shared the same outdoorsy hobbies and he seemed great. \n\nAfter they married... he put on several hundred pounds, no longer cleaned up their home. No longer made anything. He quit his job out of the blue after she became a nurse practitioner. He constantly disses and puts her down whenever he can. It's awful.", "I confirm. My three-and-four-year-old preschool students know that whenever they make a mess they\u2019re responsible for dealing with the aftermath.", "Your comment history is... disturbing. You have been trying to have a baby for 6 years, but you're only 23. You openly admit your partner and you don't see eye to eye. You admit you need therapy, but say you don't have the money. You also just said a couple weeks ago that you need to get your own place, after only living with your husband for 3 months.\n\nI'm worried about you. You have some serious issues to figure out BEFORE bringing in an innocent, expensive, and exhausting baby into this mess. NTA, but please take this seriously.", "Damn, that's a big yikes if you reach the point where you're thankful for that. I'm very sorry for your losses, and you should definitely be working this out with him before considering a child again.\n\nCan he compromise and offer up a different chore he could do instead? Laundry? Vacuuming?", "From experience they don\u2019t change. And you\u2019re still young . Don\u2019t waste your youth on toxic people", ">I mean om infertile\n\nSince it's a common misconception that doctors don't always explain, being infertile does NOT mean you cannot get pregnant and have a child. That would be sterility. Being infertile means the chances of pregnancy are lower and there's a higher chance of the pregnancy not lasting to full term (my condolences on the losses you mentioned elsewhere).\n\nSo you absolutely should still be using a contraceptive if you're sexually active but not wanting a child at this time. And I know I would not want a child with a man who would contribute so little towards the hard parts of caring for that child. (I'd also be celibate in your situation - I wouldn't have *any* sexual attraction for a man who acts like a child and expects me to parent him.)", "https://www.sciencealert.com/womens-libidos-increase-when-partners-do-their-share-of-the-chores-study-finds\n\nI doubt taking intercourse hostage would solve things but the link refers to a recent research where women libido decrease in an unfair relationship.", "Your priest? Fuckin lol", "Thank you for making this point.  It's the parentification of the spouse, lack of partnership, resentment, and being tired from extra housework that drive the lack of sexual attraction, not necessarily withholding as punishment, even tho the result is the same."]}
