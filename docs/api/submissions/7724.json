I know it doesn't seem like much but most nights I come home exhausted or sick from something I picked up at work to make dinner and run the budget things like that, and when I come home he is playing guitar, video games or watching TV.\nWhen we first moved in together we had an agreement that if I cook he'll do dishes but recently its been all on me to cook, to do dishes to clean the entire kitchen while he does the bare minimum. Yes he can organise things and take out bins once or twice a week but it is still not enough.\n\nI brought it up recently that I'm feeling overwhelmed and he told me that me asking him to do the dishes every day annoys him since his mum used to volunteer him to do dishes when he lived with her and nagged him for hours on end until it was done. She also cut off his bedroom eletric if he didn't do dishes. He said he feels he chips in more than enough.\n\nI told him he's a grown man with his own house and if he's not willing to share chores then I'll stop doing my part and he'll see how much I actually do compared to him.\nSo I've stopped doing dishes. \n3 days in and the sink is full and the kitchen stinks. \nApparently it makes me the asshole according to him and our friends but I feel like I need to stand my ground.\n\nAm I the problem?", "created_utc": 1674129930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g01n2/aita_if_i_get_mad_over_my_husband_not_doing_dishes/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You married a child.", "NTA. Is it too late to get the marriage annulled?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to be an adult or a team player. He wants you to be his new mummy that looks after him but doesn\u2019t give him chores to do.\n\nI don\u2019t see this marriage lasting.

You find this stuff out much sooner. \n\nHe should be doing more, that much is obvious. Problem is, he doesn't care. Telling him you won't do anything has had no effect. Talking has had no effect. So how far are you willing to go? How much of a dealbreaker is this for you? That's what you need to think about.", "NTA\n\nWhat type of baby mentality is that? Comparing you to his mother?

But considering you work longer hours AND cook, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s acting like a child. And I\u2019m pretty sure most of reddit will agree with you that he should start pulling his own weight more (as a gamer myself I think he\u2019s making the rest of us look bad). Show him this reddit if you have to but don\u2019t overwork yourself because he\u2019s being a potato", "NTA. Sounds like a power struggle and his inability to see past outdated gender roles. It also amplifies his lack of respect for your viewpoint. When you get home, make your dinner, eat, clean up after yourself. When he asks about dinner tell him you already ate. Stop picking up after him, he's not a child.", "NTA. His attitude sucks - no one blames him for not liking to do the dishes, but why should he think that falls on you? He's failing at being an adult or a partner here.\n\nOne of the oddest things my partner and I started doing (without planning to) is arguing over who *gets* to do the dishes. It's pretty obviously playful on both our parts, but we each try and sneak over to get to them first, or argue that the other cooked, or say \"You got to do it last night!\"  \n\nI have to admit, I still kind of hate doing the dishes, but I really like playing the game (and winning most of the time!). Only problem is the kids started getting in on the action...", "NTA  \nvery common problem it seems, i've heard lots about grown up guys who don't wanna do their part of chores or can't bring themselves to do even if they want, because they had bad experience with their moms  \nhope ur husband will understand he can't leech off u forever, stop doing him any favors and if he is mature enough he will apologize and start doing chores", "NTA\n\nGet the fair play cards and go through them. He buys his free time with your exhaustion. If he doesn\u2019t change, leave him.\n\nJoin bridging the gap on face book, understand that this isn\u2019t small, it\u2019s foundational. This isn\u2019t love, it isn\u2019t a partnership. He\u2019s getting everything with minimal effort and he LOVES it, he just wants you to shut up, be his mother and yet still find him attractive \ud83e\udd22\n\nMake sure your birth control is working because if you think he\u2019s bad now, just wait until he can ignore a baby as well as the housework.", "The mature thing to do would be to agree to doing the dishes in exchange for your husband taking on one of your chores that you don\u2019t want to do. \n\nThe beauty of being married is that he hates dishes and you hate (eg) cleaning the toilet so you can agree to do the dishes if he agrees to clean the toilet.\n\nHowever you are NTA because it sounds like your husband wants you to do extra and act like his mother.

You didn't marry him to replace his mother and/or be his maid.

You need to communicate with him that he needs to be an adult and help around the house.

It's not ok to weaponize his trauma against you.  Marriage can not be a transactional thing,  but he needs to contribute. If he legitimately has issues,  then while he works on those, he can find another way to help. \n\nIf you stay,  prepare yourself for similar circumstances.   Before long, he'll stop organizing because his dad would call him names,  or he'll stop taking the trash because an ex made him feel like trash. \n\nIf the burden is slowly shifting your way and he's stated that he had no intention of balancing...... then he doesn't really love you.  You're just his favorite person who isn't himself.", "Quit cooking stuff. On your way home from work, stop off for a quick bite and when you get home you don\u2019t even mention dinner. If he asks tell him you can\u2019t since the dishwasher has quit and it is too stressful to cook until the dishes are washed.  Don\u2019t mention that you ate.", "NTA\n\nIt's ok for him to say he doesn't want to do dishes because it is the one chore he hates due to being forced to do it as a kid.\n\nIt's ok if he's not doing a chore because he genuinely doesn't know or understand it needs doing. Eg not everyone agrees how often you need to wash the bed linen or how dirty the floor needs to be before it needs cleaning.\n\nBut\n\nIt's not ok to avoid dishes if he's not substituting with something else, and more generally if he's not doing his fair share of the chores.\n\nIt's not ok to avoid a chore after it's been agreed with your partner what a chore is, ie you can't keep claiming you don't know it needs doing once it's been pointed out it needs doing. Plus in this case it's hard not to realise dishes need cleaning - it's not like dusting or ironing where there's a subjective opinion on how often it needs doing.\n\nAnd what's a \"fair share\" - would often be 50% but really depends on context. If someone works 55hrs compared to the other 35hrs because they both need the money and both benefit from it, then the one with less work needs to do more chores. But 35hrs is full-time employment, so if the one doing 55hrs is choosing to do that without the other encouraging them or saying they need the extra income, then they're effectively choosing a (probably unhealthy) amount of work of their own choice and that shouldn't stop their need to do chores any more than someone choosing to play games with their time beyond a normal working week. Or if one partner is ill or physically or mentally unable to do as many tasks, then their fair share might not be 50%. Or if one of you is also caring for a parent they might do less.\n\nI would suggest if he really doesn't want to do dishes, then switch it, preferably for something you don't like yourself, eg you do dishes but he could do the cooking, the food shopping, the dusting, the clothes washing, cleaning the kitchen or bathroom, sweeping/vacuuming the floors, gardening, diy, etc. Agree which tasks you each do, and what frequency is acceptable, and then you can better insist on him doing them.", "NTA find a better husband, find better friends", "Nope definitely NTA. Who cares if he had to do dishes as a kid? Lol lots of kids do dishes as part of their chores. Doesn\u2019t mean he gets a pass in doing them as an adult. He\u2019s being lazy and selfish, and definitely not pulling his weight with the household chores!", "Part of me is glad I've lost my pregnancies before now. Couldn't in this moment imagine him as a father.", "This is our first time living together but sleepovers and things like that chores were always even.", "They were lazy, entitled AH to their mum and now they are lazy, entitled AH to their partners. Notice the common denominator here is they are lazy, entitled AH? Parents do not actually enjoy nagging or cutting off electronics. It is called a consequence to not pulling your weight and expecting everyone around you to do your chores for you. It is utterly pathetic and misogynistic for these AH to blame their mums.", "I mean om infertile so my body must have predicted him \ud83e\udd23", "That's the next step", "Ok, I'm old. So factor that in I guess, but this sounds exhausting. I don't know why you would want to live with someone who isn't acting like an adult. If its for companionship, get a dog. If it's for sex, find a fwb who doesn't leave dirty dishes around.", "tbf moms can be messy, controlling and somewhat crazy in some situations. and it seems mostly in mother-son relationship. i know one mom which actually enjoyed making her son's life miserable and still kind of does, even tho her son is an adult man already. she doesn't even realize how much harm was done with her actions. some people aren't mature enough to have kids and they never seem to mature, even at the age of 50+", "I sure hope so, the women I know that are so angry at themselves for staying with this guy.", "Don\u2019t use sex as a weapon. Learn to communicate. It might be useful for you two to chat with a counsellor or your priest etc about effective communication. People don\u2019t magically learn it. They either have parents who were good role models or they pay a \u201cteacher\u201d.", "Withholding sex as \"punishment\" or \"manipulation\" rarely works in my opinion and can actually make things work. This sounds like your first major disagreement that requires both parties to sit down and have an open an honest communication outside the bedroom but this conversation has to be without emotions or judgement.\n\n\nI'm sorry but all the people who are saying to leave him & leave the marriage are telling you to take the easy way out. Marriage is work and takes time, honesty, and effort. If people ran at the first sign of disagreement no one would be married \n\n\nOh and NTA - marriage is shared responsibility and being there for the other person if they need you to pickup slack or something.", "I'm not so sure I personally would have much sexual attraction to someone who was acting like a child and comparing me to his mother. So if it was me, I wouldn't even be interested in sex at this point. And that's a pretty good reason to not sleep with someone.\n\nBut I get what you're saying. *He* will certainly see it as OP weaponizing sex, even though she's absolutely the one in the right."]}
