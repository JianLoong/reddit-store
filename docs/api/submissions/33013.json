Meanwhile, his mom (F, Greencard holder) who married and had lost her late husband (M) a few years ago decides to move back to her hometown and spends the rest of her retirement there. She moved in Dec 2022. \n\nAll was good. However, I recently found a mail from the US immigration and US social security services that was addressed to her name. I then asked my fiance about it and he said his mom wants to use my address as RESIDENCE to file for survivor social security benefits and Medicare. All this happen unbeknownst to me. With a little more research, it appears that if a greencard holder left United States for more than 6 months in a year, they will have to give up their path to citizenship. \n\nSince she is a greencard holder and left US for over a year now, she would've relinquished her rights to citizenship and benefits. However, she still wants to withdraw SS and Medicare from US because the money goes a lot further in her home country. Although it's possible to obtain exemption, the process can be long and complicated so she just says she resided in my home the entire time. \n\nNow, I found this morally wrong. Moreover, she used my address without asking me, and nevermind that I might get into legal trouble. I've asked my fiance to talk to his mom about it. He basically shrugged it off and said I should be the one who talk to his mom about it. Now, I do not want to be the bad guy and I don't want to make accusations, so I plan on just sending the mail back unopened as the recipient does not live here by writing \"not at this address\", and let the offices handle it. AITA? \n\nBtw- fiances mom is not destitute by any means. She is purchasing a million dollar condo in her home country using her late husband's funds.

She's looking for benefits she and her late husband paid for. If they didn't pay for them, she wouldn't be able to collect them. If she were a citizen living abroad, she could collect. It is frankly pretty scammy of the govt to keep their contributions in the circumstances. Not saying fraud is ok, just that she's not actually \"stealing\" anything."]}
