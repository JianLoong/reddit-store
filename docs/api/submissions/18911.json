It's so annoying he says those things. \n\nSince my daughter got diagnosis with leukemia / started chemo we haven't seen my family super often because of my daughter\u2019s now weak immune system. Well, about 2 weeks ago my daughter convinced me to let her dye my hair... So I now have pink hair which I honestly enjoy. I work from home so it's not like I have to look professional or anything plus it made my girl happy. Well 6 days ago she had a chemo session and that was a really rough one afterward she laid in bed for 4 days straight. Yesterday she finally felt better and we ended up having a movie/ spa day to celebrate. In the middle of the whole spa day my mom wanted to face time well I had a cucumber facemask on as well as getting my nails painted by my daughter. \n\nChris ended up being there and when he saw me he laughed and said at this point I'm just unmasculine and just gave my man card away. I finally got fed up with his comments and called Chirs an idiot for thinking that way and that he just a sexist asshole who is completely fixed on being manly. I then told Chris that's the reason he can never keep a girlfriend and he needs to stop trying to be overly manly.

Have you ever told him before that it bothers you when he does it, or did this just flare up?
