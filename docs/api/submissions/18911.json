I am a single dad and her mother isn't around because she chose other things over her daughter when our daughter was a toddler. 2 months ago my daughter got diagnosis with Leukemia. It has been difficult for her both physically and mentally. \n\nI have always done anything to make my little girl happy but now especially I'm really big on Just making her happy during this very difficult time. My brother \u201cChris\u201d (m40) has always given me shit for this. Throughout my daughter\u2019s life, I've always done anything she wanted to go play with Barbies, play beauty salon, watch princess movies, etc. Chris who is super fixed on being a manly man always gives me shit asking if I lost my man card, saying he's glad it's not him being forced into doing all these girly things. It's so annoying he says those things. \n\nSince my daughter got diagnosis with leukemia / started chemo we haven't seen my family super often because of my daughter\u2019s now weak immune system. Well, about 2 weeks ago my daughter convinced me to let her dye my hair... So I now have pink hair which I honestly enjoy. I work from home so it's not like I have to look professional or anything plus it made my girl happy. Well 6 days ago she had a chemo session and that was a really rough one afterward she laid in bed for 4 days straight. Yesterday she finally felt better and we ended up having a movie/ spa day to celebrate. In the middle of the whole spa day my mom wanted to face time well I had a cucumber facemask on as well as getting my nails painted by my daughter. \n\nChris ended up being there and when he saw me he laughed and said at this point I'm just unmasculine and just gave my man card away. I finally got fed up with his comments and called Chirs an idiot for thinking that way and that he just a sexist asshole who is completely fixed on being manly. I then told Chris that's the reason he can never keep a girlfriend and he needs to stop trying to be overly manly. He called me an asshole. \n\nMy parents ended up agreeing with Chris saying I was in the wrong for bringing up his dating life.

If he doesn't want to hear the truth, he should keep his opinions to himself.", "NTA, maybe Chris will finally shut up. Way to be there for your daughter!", "NTA.\n\nGood dad's with daughters get it. Your brother is projecting his insecurities of feeling \"not man enough\" onto you. Keep doing what makes your daughter happy!", "NTA. You\u2019re being a dad and more of a man than Chris will ever be, if he lives as he says he does. \n\nDad props. Good luck with the medical issues, that sounds awful.

She doesn't need the stress of anger/fighting.\n\nNow that you got it out of your system, laugh his stuff off in the future. Maybe laughingly tell him he's just jealous that he can't have pink hair, a facial, etc. He enjoys pulling your string so don't let him.\n\n He goaded you until you finally snapped.

You are an excellent father and I am so glad your daughter has you. She has been dealt some difficult cards, but you have not given her any reason to doubt she is worthy of love and joy. That can be a major fear for those who have a parent who walked away. I think your daughter will be ok though. Gender norms are stupid anyway, but they should not even be a question between a dad and a daughter. He is the one missing out, not you.", "NTA, WTF is wrong with him?!  He's basically making fun of your daughter too for wanting you to participate. I hate people like that, that think men can't play or make their girls happy. When my daughter was a toddler, my husband let her \"do his makeup\". You are a great dad, and I hope more dad's are like you. I hope for her to beat this and it never to come back!  I don't think anyone here would side with your moron brother", "NTA he is a sexist asshole and you\u2019re a good dad!", "NTA.\n\nIt was kinda of a low blow, I guess, since his dating life is not exactly relevant to why his behavior to you is AHish.\n\nBut it's a much lower blow for him to try and mess up your daddy/daughter time as she goes through cancer treatment.\n\nYour brother sounds like a real gem.  And why aren't your parents telling your bro to grow up and also shut up?", "NTA because given the circumstances, I probably would\u2019ve said a lot worse to him!", "Your family are the arseholes - your daughter is super sick and your doing your darndest to make her feel better.

Look, I know i may get flack for telling you to 'pull the cancer card'. But, Chris needs a humble dose of reality. How awful of him. \n\nCommenting so I can see the update Op posts: AITA, 'Manly Man' brother got a Gf finally, I told her over the holiday how he talked to me and kiddo. She dumped him for his behavior, now everyone's mad at me.

Going with a soft ESH because it really wasn't the right time to address it. Brother is definitely a sexist AH who needs to get over the whole man card thing.

His need to be toxically masculine is probably a cause for him being single. It just sounds like you\u2019re trying to be a good father going through a rough time.
