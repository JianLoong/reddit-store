It's so annoying he says those things. \n\nSince my daughter got diagnosis with leukemia / started chemo we haven't seen my family super often because of my daughter\u2019s now weak immune system. Well, about 2 weeks ago my daughter convinced me to let her dye my hair... So I now have pink hair which I honestly enjoy. I work from home so it's not like I have to look professional or anything plus it made my girl happy. Well 6 days ago she had a chemo session and that was a really rough one afterward she laid in bed for 4 days straight. Yesterday she finally felt better and we ended up having a movie/ spa day to celebrate. In the middle of the whole spa day my mom wanted to face time well I had a cucumber facemask on as well as getting my nails painted by my daughter. \n\nChris ended up being there and when he saw me he laughed and said at this point I'm just unmasculine and just gave my man card away. I finally got fed up with his comments and called Chirs an idiot for thinking that way and that he just a sexist asshole who is completely fixed on being manly. I then told Chris that's the reason he can never keep a girlfriend and he needs to stop trying to be overly manly. He called me an asshole. \n\nMy parents ended up agreeing with Chris saying I was in the wrong for bringing up his dating life.

U sir have two roles to fill, being her father and mother. There will be some things you won't be able to do as well as a woman but all you can do is do your best to be her everything. I've raised my son since he was a toddler, 8 now,  cause his mom did the exact same thing ur baby momma did. Now I'm gonna be raising my 18 month daughter solo too bc her Mom passed away 4 months ago. I know the single parent struggle and I couldn't imagine having my kids getting sick like your little princess. Good job for being the man you are, ur parents obviously raised u well,  so I don't know what ur brothers excuse is.", "If he\u2019s throwing stones, it\u2019s perfectly fine to throw stones back at him. NTA", "I mean, he asked for it by constantly making comments about your life and activities as a dad. He could just go about his day and mind his business if he had an issue. NTA.\n\nAlso, in my experience, once you \u201cgo too far\u201d when snapping back at rude and unnecessary comments, they seem to magically stop being made. People don\u2019t wanna act right until they served what they dish out.", "NTA- amazing dad \ud83e\udd79", "NTA. Your brother sounds immature as hell, your take on his dating life sounds spot on. Best wishes to you and your daughter.", "lol man card nta", "A real manly man can pull off raising a girl, doing girly things, have cucumber face masks and pink hair. \nYou're such a great dad and I hope your daughter will recover fully. She sounds like a brave girl.\nChris is jealous, petty and boring. \n\nNTA.", "NTA as a women it would totally turn me of for a man not to be comfortable in his sexuality. I mean why is he upset seeing you take care of yourself and do traditionally feminine things? It sounds like he has bigger problems then you because atleast you know what important.  Best of luck for your daughter and I wish her a speedy and painless recovery \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA, you are amazing! Your brother can pound sand, it is obvious he has no idea what you and your daughter are going through on a daily basis.", "Never change OP. You're an amazing father (NTA) :)", "NTA.  And a man who is comfortable enough in himself for face masks, hair dye, nails etc, but also does it for his daughters enjoyment, is a beacon of what a man is.  The man who has to yell about being manly is the same as a little dog barking trying to convince others he\u2019s big and strong.", "NTA\n\nThat probably IS the reason. It was good feedback.", "NTA, he sounds like a bully who is jealous that you are comfortable enough in your own skin to be \u201cunmanly\u201d when I can\u2019t think of anything more manly than a father doing what he needs to do for his kids happiness. His behaviour is unmanly.", "NTA at all. You're a girl dad, and a single parent at that, you're going to have to do \"girly\" things because she has no one else. I hope that if we have a daughter my fianc\u00e9 will do all of these things with her/us too because those moments bond you. Keep being the best dad you can be to that little girl and ignore everything they're saying. You're also probably spot on with why he's still single as well! I'm so sorry she's not well, I really hope she gets better soon. Big hugs to you both stranger on the Internet, you're doing great and don't let anyone else make you think otherwise", "NTA at all. I\u2019m 16 and omg I admire you so so much rn. You seem like an amazing day and I wish I had you as a father you seem so so kind. I know your daughter appreciates this so much as well and thank you for being there for her, I wish her and you all the best and hope everything gets better for her, and that you can leave those toxic people out of your guys\u2019 life", "NTA. You\u2019re comfortable in your masculinity and yourself, which is why you\u2019re happy to do these perfectly normal things with your daughter. Your brother on the other hand is obviously insecure. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you and your daughter are going through this. I hope she makes a full recovery.", "NTA. I\u2019m an almost 40 yo former Marine, lifelong mechanic, and just an all around outdoors kinda rugged guy. My wife and daughter are happy and healthy (I\u2019m sorry for you loss and your situation, I don\u2019t mean to downplay it at all) and if my daughter, she is almost 3, asks me to dress in fairy wings and and a tutu then we are going wherever in fairy wings and tutu. Hell, last weekend we went to the zoo and she wanted to wear her Guns N Roses hoodie, leggings, and a tutu. She picked that, not my wife or I. So I threw on my GnR shirt in solidarity. She got so excited we matched that I also had to wear her tiny little toddler backpack and wear her fairy wings on my head (cuz they don\u2019t fit on my back obviously) pretty much the whole time. She would get mad if I took either of them off lol. \n\nAnyway, NTA. You keep bein the best dad you can be, it sounds like you\u2019re already doin a hell of a job.\n\nOne dad to another: You\u2019re more of a man than he will ever be.", "NTA", "[removed]", "I sense that \u201cChris\u201d at the age of 40 is pushing his resentment of not having children yet onto you instead OP.", "Imagine the stud value of uncle saying the kid has cancer, she needs some kindness and play, I'll let her dress me up since she likes that. I would do anything to bring some real joy into her life. Instead, all he does is insult her father, the one person who works so hard to support her. Uncle having the maturity to realize all the things that make him a man aren't lost when he makes his sick niece happy between chemo treatments, he becomes more, not less. Panties would DROP for a guy who can be strong and kind both, has the earned ego of being a realist instead of a misogynist.
