I was told by my husband that even speaking to him to voice my concerns made me a jerk - why would I want to 'throw her out', she has nowhere else to go.. \n\n2.   refer back to #1?

She isn't going to go without a fight.  You need to get on the same page as hubs and come up with a plan and firm timeline.", "NTA and this is a husband problem as much, if not more, than a SIL problem!! If she\u2019s not contributing anything to the household, why is she still there? She works, she\u2019s an able-bodied adult, time to sit DH down and tell him that this arrangement needs to change. SiL living there for 7 years is long enough!!", "NTA - First you need to think seriously about the outcome you want, and the other potential outcomes that would be acceptable - and what you are willing to do if he doesn't get on board and enforce change with his sister. For example - your ideal outcome would be her moving out within x months, but you would be willing to let her stay if she contributes financially at x amount/cooks x meals a week/takes on x household tasks/etc. Then you need to decide what your course of action will be if he won't agree to the changes. Would you leave him? Would you stop doing certain things around the house? \n\nSit your husband down and tell him that the current living situation is no longer working and that you and he need to seriously discuss changes. If he is not even willing to have a discussion about this, then you have bigger problems than just your SIL.", "NTA\n\nThere's overstaying your welcome, and then there's staying somewhere for 7 years.", "NTA should have been addressed years ago. She should have been paying rent and doing household chores at minimum. She\u2019s not your child.", "NTA but this conversation is about 6 years too late! Once she got a job, a conversation about how she'd contribute financially should have happened. Sheesh! You have a husband problem. He needs to sit down with his sister and give her a timeline to move out and stick to it. She's had many years to save so I wouldn't give the housing market excuse any leeway.", "NTA but this is normal for her now. Any attempt to remove her from your home, no matter how kind, is going to seem unfair to her (it absolutely isn\u2019t, but when people get the long end of the stick for long enough, they start to think that it\u2019s a fair deal). I would definitely be making this my husband\u2019s problem to solve.", "NTA. You need to set boundaries ASAP. Your husband and his sister have successfully made you their domestic. You need to have a long conversation with the SIL. Good luck OP.", "ugh, tell DH either he tells a timeline, or you guys go for counseling", "INFO   \n\n\nHave you asked her to contribute in some way (Cooking, cleaning, monetarily, etc)?", "NTA, it's normal to want privacy with your immediate family.\n\nYou would feel better though if she did contribute.", "NTA if you kicked her out or gave her a timeline of like 6 months to find a place to live or even helped her find a condo or something but your NTA if you decide to kick her out but I would get your husbands approval first because it sounds like he\u2019s allowing her to stay there.", "NTA. It's a weird dynamic. Failure to launch from your brother's house.", "Info: if she contributed financially would that be enough of a compromise?", "NTA, but even though \"15 years\" from your perspective is something that's growing tiring, from her perspective it's been more and more normalized, so even though you have no *duty* to give her a long heads-up, consider doing it. Six months would be most generous.", "NTA Time to charge rent and utilities.  She'll leave.", "Have to say NAH because it sounds like she is there and living like that with your husband's approval. And apparently there was never any discussion of a timeline/expectations at the beginning of the situation....?\n\nIt's certainly legit for you to want her to move on, but the issue is with your own spouse.  And this has been going on so long now, you should definitely expect pushback. Good luck though.", "NTA   \n\n\nRemove her devices from the network (get in the router, block her mac addresses), change password, stop cooking for her. dont get her cleaning supplies, dont do her laundry, etc, do small things to make her mad and leave.  \n\n\ntell your partner, THIS IS MY HOUSE TOO, if you want me to be naked and having fun time with me on the living room, kick her out. (that will work)", "That woman has been living rent-free for 7 bloody years. You've more patience than me because I would have told her straight time to move on. She's never going to leave until you and your husband are on the same page. I would tell him either she finds a place to stay or you will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, what bothers you more: the freeloading or the fact that she\u2019s living there at all? If it\u2019s the former, maybe you can insist she start paying rent and helping out around the house.", "NTA you've been extremely accommodating! I can't believe she has lived there rent and bill free all this time! Of course she won't be in a rush to find somewhere she has to pay for. I think you'll need to give her a time limit, say, 3 months notice? \nOr at least get her to pay rent if you decide she is staying. \nAlso sounds like you have a husband issue, why does he disagree with her moving out?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAre they close..? \ud83d\ude09", "NTA. Seven years totally expense free, she should have quite a tidy sum of money to put down on any home she chooses. It may be time to have a heart to heart with your husband. Have a plan in mind. Give her six months to find a place. Make sure you specify a deadline.  You are not throwing her out but it is time for her to get out on her own and have a life so you and your husband can do the same. You can even tell him that you will be the one to sit her down and talk with her as long as he backs you up. If he totally refuses, then you will need to decide if you can live the rest of your life this way. Don\u2019t make threats you aren\u2019t willing to keep. \n\nYou might consider pointing out that the cost of housing and feeding an adult for seven years would have made it great college fund for your daughter. If she were to stay and pay her own way, would you be OK with that? If that\u2019s an option then figure out what the going rate is for a roommate, including food, housing, and utilities. Since you do all of the house work, you can also include that. Cite the need to have a college fund for your daughter.", "7 years of salary, even at minimum wage, is enough to have a savings to move out. She's not paying rent or bills. If she didn't prepare, oh well. NTA, but if your husband won't agree maybe it's time to consider if they BOTH need to leave. The two can get an apartment together and sort it out.", "NTA. You need to be firm. Stop the tip toeing around. Tell your husband she needs to go. If he says no, pick up you child and leave to a relatives home and let him stew in it. He has to make a choice, his sitter ir his family.", "NTA and i would give your husband an ultimatum either your sister goes or you and the child goes. seems unless you do something drastic that nothing will change because everyone but you is ok with the situation", "NTA... Let your husband know that you no longer want SIL as a roommate.  You want your space and privacy returned and that you be a 'couple again'. You can give her a decent time limit to move out by. \nIf your SIL makes this about you there is no shame in saying : \"I want my space and privacy and the partnership I signed up for. It's not about you at all, you have had a long free ride and I'm happy to have helped provide this for you. But that time is up.\" \n\nYOU ARE NOT SELFISH for wanting what is a reasonable expectation in marriage. \nYOU ARE GENEROUS about what you have participated in gifting her.\n\nYOUR husband is a selfish AH if he is anything but supportive and accommodating in this situation.", "NTA.  You know the definition of the word \"freeloader\" right?  You have one right there in your home.  \n\nIf she stays, draw up a list of her expenses: rent, utilities, food, etc.", "NTA.  Give her 60 days notice.  But your problem is going to be with your husband.  What are you going to do if he refuses to make her move out?", "What has taken you so long? If you allow people to take advantage of you, they will. You need to put your foot down and say it has been long enough. I don't know why your husband has been fine with her living there rent free and responsibility free for years either, while you cook, clean and pay all the bills.", "NTA", "This is what I was thinking. Odd to me that he doesnt also want this. OP you seem passive. Time to set some boundaries and speak up. Lovingly let your SIL know that you have loved living with her but you want to live with your immediate family now. Tell your husband that is a need not a want and its going to happen and he needs to support you. Obviously dont throw her out, but i imagine shes saved plenty of money in the last 7 years to move somewhere decent.", "NTA that was where my thoughts went, unless your husband ids on board it's not going to happen and you have to discuss it with him or professional's to show how he's choosing his sister over you.\n\nthat or just start playing a lot of cab calloway when she comes into a room.", "You shouldn't need to be asked. I would be mortified to be taking advantage of anyone in this way, let alone family. Mortified.", "Are you really asking if its ok to want to live your life on your own terms?   Your husband needs to grow a set and tell SIL its time to leave.   IF he cant, you should.   NTA", "No. You are the AH for letting her live their rent free for 7 years. Your husband is the real AH. Time for her to fly.", "NTA.  Marriage counseling.  You need to be able to discuss this without a fight and a therapist might help.  This really is a husband problem.  I can\u2019t imagine having someone and their kid living with my spouse and I for that long, especially for free.", "Tell your husband his sister or you. You are nta for an ultimatum.", "You are NTA but time to put your foot down.  7 years of freeloading is too long.  Time fir a proper sit down and put a must leave date of 1 month in place.
