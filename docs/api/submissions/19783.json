Your boyfriend has classic \"failure to launch\".  Every time he's failed his parents have solved the problem for him.  He has no obligations, works part time, has no bills.  If you wait for him, you might wait forever.", "NTA. What you are doing is setting expectations and boundaries, and I hope you stick to them. If he doesn\u2019t change you will be a parent and not a girlfriend, and you can do better than that.", "NTA. But, he's coddled, enabled, and entitled. He's not going to give that up easily. You have an uphill battle ahead of you. Seems clear that he doesn't want to be independent.", "NTA this guy had a crazy amount of growing up to do. Before you live with him he needs a full time job, everything he\u2019s going to be responsible for paying for in his name so you can make sure he can actually pay bills/ manage money, get a savings account like why would someone keep money in an envelope?????

You are being incredibly patient with him and I hope he finds a sense of personal responsibility.  Until he matures/gets his sh*t together, you are signing up to be Mommy 2.0 and it'll be you getting an attitude from him when you ask him to do his part around the house.  He says \"why is it always about\" him when you all discuss the future, then ask him what his vision of the future might be (not 10 years out, or even 5, but how and when does he see the next step?)

He sounds like a loser who can\u2019t take care of himself. Which is fucking pathetic unless he\u2019s mentally disabled or something (which it sounds like he might be). I would stop wasting your time with him.", "NTA. But someone who's been coddled for that long is going to find it very difficult to move on.

It just sounds like you each have different priorities.", "NTA\n\nBut before you move in if you want a cute boy to raise, puppies are much easier.", "NTA. If you really see a future with and want to marry this man you have to be prepared to not only be his wife but his mother. All of her tasks will become yours\u2014this might even include taking care of him financially at some point. This enters breakup territory and should consider it.", "NTA. In my opinion, you aren't being condescending. \n\nYou're asking very valid questions and if he intends to marry you, then it makes tons of sense for you to be asking him these things and setting expectations for him. \n\nHe is 6 years older than you and completely dependent on his parents. That would be a ginormous turn off for me personally (and honestly for most women). \n\nYou're making the right choice by saying you aren't moving in with him anytime soon. The reason it's \"always about\" him is because he's the one who is stagnant in his growth as an individual. \n\nYour relationship can't move forward into marriage if he isn't putting in the work to be husband material. You're bringing a lot to the table as his partner. What does he bring to the table, besides a good time? This really matters!!\n\nSometimes love just is not enough to make a lifelong partnership work. You don't want to allow someone who is co-dependent on his parents to live with you because he will try to depend on you in the same manner, if he doesn't get his shit together. \n\nSet expectations and clear boundaries, and even a timeline. You said you two discussed moving together in a year. I'd address it with him and let him know he needs to be completely independent in order for that to happen. Meaning he pays all his own bills, works a reliable job so he has reliable income, and gets on his own phone plan as you previously stated. \n\nYou don't want to become his provider. You want a stable partnership and you deserve that.", "Definitely NTA and clearly your choices in life aren\u2019t vining right now. He\u2019s a 26 year old child who is *letting* purposely his parents do everything for him. You\u2019re ready to settle down and be an independent couple, but he\u2019s absolutely nowhere near where you are! I\u2019m a way I understand why get defensive but you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. \n\nHonestly, this is going to take a long of work on his part and patience on yours to make it work long term. He\u2019s going to need you to spell it all out for him because he clearly doesn\u2019t even know where to start \n\nGood luck!", "It\u2019s a really tricky balance - if you can aim for \u201cI am stating my expectations, without stress or energy - just stating them as the facts they are\u201d INSTEAD of trying to help him or coach him - then that is the way. \n\nYou will need to prepare yourself to issue a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d deadline sooner rather than later though. At which point you will absolutely need to be ready to walk away. \n\nBecause sadly you are probably wasting your time with this guy - and you won\u2019t find out either way until he is forced to act - either by moving in with you (when there\u2019s a high chance he\u2019ll stay part time, while expecting you to empty his lunch box) - or maybe he will step up. \n\nBut you won\u2019t find out if he\u2019s got it in him to \u201cstep up\u201d until his hand is forced. \n\nSo your choice is either to wait a year, move in together - then maybe find out a couple months in that he\u2019s not ever going to pull his weight. \n\nOr you can force the decision sooner - but telling him (truthfully) that you are prepared to walk away if you don\u2019t see (consistent over the long-term) signs of him taking on full responsibility for his life as an adult. \n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in doing that - then the other option would be to refuse to move in with him until he\u2019s live for 1-2 years on his own. And shown in that time that he can Adult. \n\n I can see why you\u2019d be worried that you\u2019re being unfair to him because your introduction to adulting was earlier than most - but you\u2019re actually being wise by considering this. \n\nEspecially given he\u2019s 26 and you\u2019re 20 - I had to double check the ages a couple of times, because you have the maturity of a 26 year old, where he is stuck at 20 or younger. \n\n\nMaybe think about that too - he\u2019s matured about 0.2% since he was 18 (ie he\u2019s still acting like an 18 year old school kid with no bills & housework tantrums). Whereas you\u2019ve matured about 300% since you were 17 (ie you\u2019re maturity is around the 26 year old level). \n\nThat\u2019s 300% versus 0.2%. \n\nSo right now it\u2019s as if you\u2019re 26(f), 18(m). \n\nIf that continues for another 3 years - you\u2019ll be more like 35(f), 18(m). \n\nCan you imagine having a child in that scenario - where you\u2019re at the 35-year old maturity, trying to raise a new born baby alongside an permanent-18 year old. While doing all the housework / cooking, and earning a full time wage because he\u2019s still part time (or maybe unemployed).\n\nMaybe ask yourself - is this the future you have earned for yourself, with you early independence etc. \n\nGood luck.", "Nta. He\u2019s not your boyfriend, he\u2019s a barnacle. Detach him and move on", "In this stage of courtship, you should be doing your absolute best mating dance. He should bring you pretty rocks and sticks for your home. Instead, he's eating his mom's regurgitated worms and shitting in the nest. \n\nFly away. There are far better birds out there for you.", "Don't waste another year of your life. I think you'll just end up frustrated.

Guess who will become his new mommy once you guys move in together?", "NTA \nHe's being babied by his parents and i don't think, he will want to give that up. If he moves in with you, you can expect to do everything on your own - even if he promises that he will pull his own weight in the household, he won't. I mean he's 26 and his parents clean his lunchbox really? His parents did him a great disservice, i don't believe he will change much. Are you ready to help him change? Are you ready to teach him how to be an adult? Are you willing to always put in more work, because he just can't?
