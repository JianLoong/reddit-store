However, as we got older he calmed down and we reconciled despite our earlier differences. By all means, there is nothing that says you HAVE to have a relationship with your sister, and maybe that is indeed the best for you for now, but to be frank, a lot of people are AHs in their teens only to turn it around later.

But I also get why you are done with her after she did what she did to your trans friend. \n\nI hope you will keep the door open a crack because life can be lonely without family; dumb teenagers often grow up into adults who sincerely regret their stupid actions. I hope you have a rich, full life with so many other friends and family that you won't need or miss your sister. I hope your sister matures into a well-rounded adult who is able to understand the damage she wrought by her \"prank.\" If you have kids and she has kids, you could think about mending your relationship so your children's lives could be enriched by having a loving aunt and cousins. \\[Close-in-age cousins are a gift because they can be like a friend and sibling for life.\\] If sis gets her act together, I hope you won't deprive yourself, sis, and your kids (if you have them) of a relationship due to an old grudge.", "ESH.

See how things develop in years to come, and give her a fair chance if she deserves one. Because your parents are right, eventually it will just be her and you.

I understand your parents feelings because you\u2019re their children but they need to understand that you\u2019re both your own person and have no obligation to each other. Family and blood honestly are just words, my friends are closer to me than either of my brothers have ever been.\n\nI do think though, that you both should plan their funerals. I had to handle my mothers funeral basically by myself because I was the only one who spoke to her about her wishes and it was difficult to be responsible for everything when the duties should have been split between us.", "NTA. Your sister endangered your friend's life for laughs.\n\nFunerals can be pre-planned. Your parents can easily take care of their wishes themselves and unless they plan on exiting at the same time, one of them will be taking care of the details for the other.", "NTA.\nYou would still be NTA if this was just a simple compatibility issue, but it\u2019s not. The prank was unforgivable, especially if you and your friend are still close (I hope her actions did not have a negative impact on your friendship). Even if you and the friend just drifted apart for no particular reason, the prank still said a lot about your sister\u2019s character.\nMy dad has a sister where it was just a compatibility issue. My mom was very \u201cfamily is family\u201d and kept contact with my aunt for that reason. My mom died six years ago and I\u2019m entirely shocked that my aunt and dad actually have contact. They email every few months. Dad sends her pictures of my kids. I think it\u2019s fine. If you never meshed in the first place, then you did not always have \u201cissues\u201d. It is way more functional to admit you\u2019re not compatible and go on your merry way than to keep trying to like each other because your family. As I said, my mom had that attitude. Guess whose side eventually had a major rift due to bottled up emotions?\nIt is better to be alone than to only have family you have a dysfunctional dynamic with. And who\u2019s to say you will even be alone? You may have your own family one day. You may end up with friends who become a real family. Family of origin is not a guarantee that you won\u2019t be isolated later in life. It\u2019s also not the only way to not be isolated. \nBut in your position, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to have a LC relationship with her (similar to my dad and aunt) if she didn\u2019t own that her prank was wrong.", "Blood doesn\u2019t mean anything but blood.  Whatever reason siblings are not close is their reality and really nobody else\u2019s business.  You do you!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOuting someone is NOT a prank, that is straight abuse.", "Well your NTA, but I can understand both sides of this issue. Your parents hope to help you two heal a rift that if not done soon will guarantee it will never happen, and that\u2019s ok! At 60 years old I have seen this many times and some heal and others do not. Please do not hold a lifetime grudge over something stupid, mean and foolish a 15 year old did. There may be many other issues worth holding a lifelong grudge over though. Coming from someone who has not spoken to his two brothers in over 10 years because they did not agree with me following my dads wishes when he died of not having a memorial and being cremated. It\u2019s their grudge and not mine but I do not care if we talk or not.\n\nNow for the big issue, your parents! I understand why they want what they want but you need to have an adult to adult talk with them. Tell them if they want to do the family a favor they need to plan their own death processes. If they want to be cremated, buried, have a memorial, the whole kit and kaboodle. That is the single most generous thing they can do for y\u2019all. \n\nMy last piece of advise is to at least keep an open mind towards your sister always. I am not saying to forgive her or be best friends with her. But if she was to ever grow up and have a family and change her ways you might have a minimal relationship. What if your parents live to a ripe old age and need care and it requires both of you to get it done? There\u2019s always twist and turns in life and you never know when or how it will change, good or bad, but what I know 100% is when people take away any chance in their mind the opportunity is always lost. I\u2019m a firm believer to never say never!", "NTA.  Your sister made a mistake that cannot be forgiven. Then called it a prank.", "NTA. Your parents need to plan their own funerals, get living wills etc. Urge your parents to work that all out now. It is sad when siblings don't mesh but that is reality. The best you can do sometimes is to be civil to each other.", "Planning funerals at a later stages in life is not unusual. In fact, funeral plan companies exist to cater for that very thing.", "With family like that, who needs enemies?", "No it's not. And it's clear sister is not the one who wants to mend things, that's the parents", "No they shouldn't.  They don't want to  be in each other's lives. Parents are the one creating a narrative where just because they share DNA they must love themselves, clearly not the case.", "Of all the ignorant things I\u2019ve seen today (and there\u2019s been some doozies), this is definitely in the top 10.\n\nCongratulations.", "Which sometimes is better than having any family...specially a cruel AH of a sister.", "\"Malicious and Cruel\" is right, yet parents are saying OP is the one being cruel.  Do they have any idea what the sister did to create the rift?", "And the girls are getting close to 18 and likely starting to prepare to leave the nest. The parents know they soon won\u2019t see each other much unless they choose to. Therefore they have to start their manipulation now \ud83d\ude2c.", "This is my opinion. Learn to respect if someone has a different opinion than yours. I read the comments, it seems most of you commenting are not parents or did not go through it. Pretty slanted. Do you see me lecturing every single opinion I disagree? Nope. Hiding someone\u2019s opinion is really bad. It is like read what the majority agrees to."]}
