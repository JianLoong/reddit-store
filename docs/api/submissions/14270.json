By all means, there is nothing that says you HAVE to have a relationship with your sister, and maybe that is indeed the best for you for now, but to be frank, a lot of people are AHs in their teens only to turn it around later.

But I also get why you are done with her after she did what she did to your trans friend. \n\nI hope you will keep the door open a crack because life can be lonely without family; dumb teenagers often grow up into adults who sincerely regret their stupid actions. I hope you have a rich, full life with so many other friends and family that you won't need or miss your sister. I hope your sister matures into a well-rounded adult who is able to understand the damage she wrought by her \"prank.\" If you have kids and she has kids, you could think about mending your relationship so your children's lives could be enriched by having a loving aunt and cousins. \\[Close-in-age cousins are a gift because they can be like a friend and sibling for life.\\] If sis gets her act together, I hope you won't deprive yourself, sis, and your kids (if you have them) of a relationship due to an old grudge.", "ESH.

See how things develop in years to come, and give her a fair chance if she deserves one. Because your parents are right, eventually it will just be her and you.

I had to handle my mothers funeral basically by myself because I was the only one who spoke to her about her wishes and it was difficult to be responsible for everything when the duties should have been split between us.", "NTA. Your sister endangered your friend's life for laughs.\n\nFunerals can be pre-planned. Your parents can easily take care of their wishes themselves and unless they plan on exiting at the same time, one of them will be taking care of the details for the other.", "NTA.\nYou would still be NTA if this was just a simple compatibility issue, but it\u2019s not. The prank was unforgivable, especially if you and your friend are still close (I hope her actions did not have a negative impact on your friendship). Even if you and the friend just drifted apart for no particular reason, the prank still said a lot about your sister\u2019s character.\nMy dad has a sister where it was just a compatibility issue. My mom was very \u201cfamily is family\u201d and kept contact with my aunt for that reason. My mom died six years ago and I\u2019m entirely shocked that my aunt and dad actually have contact. They email every few months. Dad sends her pictures of my kids. I think it\u2019s fine. If you never meshed in the first place, then you did not always have \u201cissues\u201d. It is way more functional to admit you\u2019re not compatible and go on your merry way than to keep trying to like each other because your family. As I said, my mom had that attitude. Guess whose side eventually had a major rift due to bottled up emotions?\nIt is better to be alone than to only have family you have a dysfunctional dynamic with. And who\u2019s to say you will even be alone? You may have your own family one day. You may end up with friends who become a real family. Family of origin is not a guarantee that you won\u2019t be isolated later in life. It\u2019s also not the only way to not be isolated. \nBut in your position, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to have a LC relationship with her (similar to my dad and aunt) if she didn\u2019t own that her prank was wrong.", "Blood doesn\u2019t mean anything but blood.  Whatever reason siblings are not close is their reality and really nobody else\u2019s business.  You do you!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOuting someone is NOT a prank, that is straight abuse.", "Well your NTA, but I can understand both sides of this issue. Your parents hope to help you two heal a rift that if not done soon will guarantee it will never happen, and that\u2019s ok! At 60 years old I have seen this many times and some heal and others do not. Please do not hold a lifetime grudge over something stupid, mean and foolish a 15 year old did. There may be many other issues worth holding a lifelong grudge over though. Coming from someone who has not spoken to his two brothers in over 10 years because they did not agree with me following my dads wishes when he died of not having a memorial and being cremated. It\u2019s their grudge and not mine but I do not care if we talk or not.\n\nNow for the big issue, your parents! I understand why they want what they want but you need to have an adult to adult talk with them. Tell them if they want to do the family a favor they need to plan their own death processes. If they want to be cremated, buried, have a memorial, the whole kit and kaboodle. That is the single most generous thing they can do for y\u2019all. \n\nMy last piece of advise is to at least keep an open mind towards your sister always. I am not saying to forgive her or be best friends with her. But if she was to ever grow up and have a family and change her ways you might have a minimal relationship. What if your parents live to a ripe old age and need care and it requires both of you to get it done? There\u2019s always twist and turns in life and you never know when or how it will change, good or bad, but what I know 100% is when people take away any chance in their mind the opportunity is always lost. I\u2019m a firm believer to never say never!", "NTA.  Your sister made a mistake that cannot be forgiven. Then called it a prank.", "NTA. Your parents need to plan their own funerals, get living wills etc. Urge your parents to work that all out now. It is sad when siblings don't mesh but that is reality. The best you can do sometimes is to be civil to each other.", "Planning funerals at a later stages in life is not unusual. In fact, funeral plan companies exist to cater for that very thing.", "With family like that, who needs enemies?", "No it's not. And it's clear sister is not the one who wants to mend things, that's the parents", "No they shouldn't.  They don't want to  be in each other's lives. Parents are the one creating a narrative where just because they share DNA they must love themselves, clearly not the case.", "Of all the ignorant things I\u2019ve seen today (and there\u2019s been some doozies), this is definitely in the top 10.\n\nCongratulations.", "Which sometimes is better than having any family...specially a cruel AH of a sister.", "\"Malicious and Cruel\" is right, yet parents are saying OP is the one being cruel.  Do they have any idea what the sister did to create the rift?", "And the girls are getting close to 18 and likely starting to prepare to leave the nest.

Do you see me lecturing every single opinion I disagree? Nope. Hiding someone\u2019s opinion is really bad. It is like read what the majority agrees to.", "NTA.  Your parents are naive for thinking manipulation and guilt will mend your relationship with your sister.

My mother ALWAYS tries to talk me out of cutting contact (using the \"grudge\" excuse) but I keep telling her to move on (and this is coming from the woman who disowned her OWN niece after getting the police called on her for picking up my Alzheimer grandmother). I remain civil to them when they're around to keep the image but in reality, the day I move out, is the day I want nothing more to do with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo no, you're not in the wrong for how you feel. The day someone wants to cut ties, that not even therapy can solve to make amends, is the day you need to realize that you need to give up.", "NTA. You are siblings, not friends. You didn't choose each other. PLUS your sister is cruel and purposefully outed someone.  I wouldn't want to be her friend either. You can plan funerals with someone that you are related to, you don't have to have a relationship with them. \n\nMy parents have been dead since I was in my 20's. 59 now and I have no relationship with my brother other than holiday and birthday texts.  It is not a problem.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re siblings doesn\u2019t mean that you need to be close. What your sister did alone is enough not to associate with her, but even if she hadn\u2019t, it would still be ok to not associate with her. My sister and I are like oil and water and have been VLC for 20 years", "ESH (very soft YTA for OP). Your feelings of anger/disgust/outrage are valid. Your parents tried to guilt trip you by talking about their funerals, which I assume not to be expected any time soon. I say soft YTA because you appear foreclosed to the possibility of ever reconciling. You may want to consider under what circumstances you could forgive her. She\u2019s not entitled to your forgiveness, but people can and do change. You\u2019d be completely justified in not having a relationship until she shows remorse, makes amends, and changes, and you may never be close. I would encourage you to consider the idea that the actions of a teenager should of course have consequences, but perhaps not for life.\n\nIf you find merit in that idea, it might be worth expressing to your parents. They are clearly troubled by the idea of you not having a relationship with your sister, and as such they should be working to mend things by helping your sister understand your perspective rather than guilting you. I obviously don\u2019t know all the details, but due to your sister\u2019s age she might deserve a chance to work to redeeming herself. It would be up to her to undertake this labor, and if she never does you should rest assured that you\u2019re NTA by not having a relationship. However, with this limited information I think you may be somewhat in the wrong for writing her off forever.\n\nYou may also want to consider that your friend was the one who was harmed and take their feelings into account. I applaud your allyship in sticking up for your friend, but they may one day forgive your sister. You could also let your friend\u2019s feelings guide you as well because part of being an ally is being mindful of when you are speaking in defense of another and when you are speaking for another.", "NTA\nYour parents could plan their funerals NOW. Many people do. They can buy burial plots and contract with a local funeral home, writing out, planning for and arranging payment for the type of funerals they want.\nIf they think leaving all those decisions to you and your sister, after one or both of them dies, is a BONDING experience, that's quite a stretch. They're more likely to get the most expensive version of casket, plot or urn, service, etc a funeral planner gets an inexperienced and grieving executrix to commit their estate's finances to funding. \n\nIt's probably just an emotional ploy to force you and your sister to either fake a closeness to appease your parents, or magically become actually close because the scales have fallen from your eyes and you now love your sister most in all the world because you share parents.", "NTA it\u2019s your relationship you get to choose. I personally have good relationships with siblings but I realize not everyone has same experience. What she did was evil and cruel I would not have a relationship with a person like that.", "NTA. I don't get along with my brother at all. He was the biggest bully in my live. He is not anymore, but he is the person I'm most afraid of in my life and most of the insecuretys I have about my body, my clothing style and my academic achivements are because of what he used to say to me. He still lives in the same house as me but we rarly ever talk. When on of us moves out we will only see each other on family events when our grand parents or parents invite both of us. My parents are totally aware of this and know they can't change this. People need to accept that blood ist not thicker than water. No one should be forced to get along with someone they dislike just because they are family.", "Your parents should plan their own funeral before they die. They shouldn't manipulate you into talking to your sister so you can plan their funeral.

Outing a trans person is not only not funny, but it can be life-altering and potentially life-threatening. Your sister sucks, and sounds like she's a cruel person. I have a sister like that too. I'm about 20 years older than you and the last time I saw/talked to her was when our dad passed almost two years ago. The last time I will ever see or talk to her is when our mom passes. I don't think our parents have ever fully understood why I don't want her in my life, but my mom seems to have at least somewhat accepted it. Both my parents had at least one out of several siblings they stopped talking to as adults, so I assumed they would understand. I've only gotten \"But it's not the saaaaaame\" from them. Once my mom brought up my sister and I made a comment- probably in regards to her being an unkind person. My mom just sighed and said \"I know you feel that way, but she's my daughter too\".
