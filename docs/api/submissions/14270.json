Once again my own personal experiences as a trans woman kick in as even as a joke, outing someone as trans is extremely cruel in a conservative school as there\u2019s no doubt they would end up subjected to abuse and bullying even if they aren\u2019t actually trans.\n\nMore on topic the parents need to realise what actually caused the lack of a relationship instead of just force on onto both of you. When my grandfather died I temporarily reestablished contact with my dad over it but never did reestablish a relationship and he\u2019s still out of my life and you hinted you might be doing the same which should be enough. I find it pretty strange that they\u2019re planning their own funerals tho. Given your age, they can\u2019t be that old. It also seems a little pessimistic that they won\u2019t live for very long. Are they okay?", "NTA\n\nYou can understand why your parents would want you to be there for each other, while at the same time acknowledging that will never happen.\n\nYou can plan a funeral with your sister while also planning never to see her again.\n\nSome siblings get along.

Some things aren't worth fixing, especially with family because sometimes we have this false sense often drilled into us that being related by blood, something you had no control of whatsoever actually is more important than the family you choose.", "NTA\n\nYour parents want this for their peace of mind, not for you. You are young. You will change. Maybe, just maybe, someday you can have some sort of relationship with your sister. But it depends on you and you only. It will be your choice.

I (35m) had a really bad relationship with my brother (38m) when we were in our teens (many arguments, some of which leading to physical altercation) and later this was exascerbated by his obsessive drinking, leading to us not interacting for many years. However, as we got older he calmed down and we reconciled despite our earlier differences. By all means, there is nothing that says you HAVE to have a relationship with your sister, and maybe that is indeed the best for you for now, but to be frank, a lot of people are AHs in their teens only to turn it around later. I can also understand that your parents would want their children to get along and be close. So they are not AHs as long as don't force the issue.", "NTAish, but have to say there\u2019s something that makes me uncomfortable about the way you are basically telling them you are waiting for them to die to be rid of sister.

Hubby and I vowed we would set up our own arrangements and not make our kids go through that.  Kids know where the will is and that there is a doc outlining the arrangements we made, and what we already paid for."]}
