Once again my own personal experiences as a trans woman kick in as even as a joke, outing someone as trans is extremely cruel in a conservative school as there\u2019s no doubt they would end up subjected to abuse and bullying even if they aren\u2019t actually trans.\n\nMore on topic the parents need to realise what actually caused the lack of a relationship instead of just force on onto both of you. When my grandfather died I temporarily reestablished contact with my dad over it but never did reestablish a relationship and he\u2019s still out of my life and you hinted you might be doing the same which should be enough. I find it pretty strange that they\u2019re planning their own funerals tho. Given your age, they can\u2019t be that old. It also seems a little pessimistic that they won\u2019t live for very long. Are they okay?", "NTA\n\nYou can understand why your parents would want you to be there for each other, while at the same time acknowledging that will never happen.\n\nYou can plan a funeral with your sister while also planning never to see her again.\n\nSome siblings get along. Others don\u2019t. Make it clear to your parents that you don\u2019t think it is their fault the two of your don\u2019t get along and reassure them that you have a support system of good friends who will help you when you need it.", "NTA. Being born into the same family does not require you to be in contact with someone. I wouldn\u2019t expect your parents to understand or respect your boundaries, mine never did.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are trying to guilt you into repairing a fractured relationship that either makes them feel uncomfortable or they see as their own failure or whatever. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, your sister sounds like a real jerk, but never say never, people can grow, situations can change, don\u2019t close off the possibility of making up one day if she sorts her sh!t out grows up.", "NTA, I get it. Some things aren't worth fixing, especially with family because sometimes we have this false sense often drilled into us that being related by blood, something you had no control of whatsoever actually is more important than the family you choose.", "NTA\n\nYour parents want this for their peace of mind, not for you. You are young. You will change. Maybe, just maybe, someday you can have some sort of relationship with your sister. But it depends on you and you only. It will be your choice. If they try to force you, it will never work.", "NAH, except your sister for outing your friend. I (35m) had a really bad relationship with my brother (38m) when we were in our teens (many arguments, some of which leading to physical altercation) and later this was exascerbated by his obsessive drinking, leading to us not interacting for many years. However, as we got older he calmed down and we reconciled despite our earlier differences. By all means, there is nothing that says you HAVE to have a relationship with your sister, and maybe that is indeed the best for you for now, but to be frank, a lot of people are AHs in their teens only to turn it around later. I can also understand that your parents would want their children to get along and be close. So they are not AHs as long as don't force the issue.", "NTAish, but have to say there\u2019s something that makes me uncomfortable about the way you are basically telling them you are waiting for them to die to be rid of sister. Can\u2019t explain it, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at.", "I'll just say this, nobody has ever been happy about not having any family at the end of their life", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
