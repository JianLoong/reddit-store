They do everything concerning the wedding party, bride and bridesmaid dresses, Groom and groomsmen suits, along with other wedding attire. \n\nMy maid of honor (Ashlyn f23) and my fiances best man (Andy M24) have been dating for about three years, and the day before we had the fitting, Andy came to us and asked if he could propose to Ashlyn at the fitting since the four of us were going to be there. We of course said yes. It was beautiful and we all cried, and so did the workers. He gave a beautiful speech and ugh, it was so cute! I had taken a picture and posted it (with their permission) to congratulate them last friday. \n\nYesterday, I got an angry text message from my fiances cousin (m31) saying that I needed to have a talk with my fiance because he said no to the cousin proposing at our wedding. It was mildly funny because my fiance was sitting next to me at the table with a grouchy look on his face for the past hour, now I know why. I texted the cousin back and told him that if my fianc\u00e9 said no, I will as well.\n\nNow his mother, the same freaking aunt that had a melt down last month about who and who we aren'tinviting to the wedding, is calling and texting, and leaving notes on our facebook saying thay it was unfair to the cousin and his girlfriend that they couldn't get engaged at my wedding even though we let our friends get engaged. We didn't have to do anything, my fiances mother and sister quickly shut their shit down. I love my in-laws.\n\nBut the people on Facebook who saw the comments are now harrassing us about the situation.... these are people who we don't even know.\n\nEdit: My SIL commented on this post!

Family is shit here", "NTA no one should plan to get engaged at someone's else's wedding. A dress appointment isn't even in the same galaxy as a wedding.", "NTA of course. Are these your aunt's fb friends chiming in on her behalf? She sounds like a woman who would have a lot of trashy low-class friends on fb who wouldn't know the first thing about social graces. I would just ignore it--it's noise from people whose opinion of you has absolutely no bearing on anything.", "NTA. The fun thing about being bothered on social media by people you don't know is that it's very easy to block them. There's a big difference between a fitting and a wedding.", "NTA. You MOH and Best Man getting engaged in a private environment with their close friends where it's not taking any spotlight off of you is WILDLY different than a cousin proposing at your wedding", "I will never understand people who think it's ok to hijack someone's big day and make it about themselves. Oh it's your wedding? Let me steal the spotlight! I'm thinking super soaker squirt guns taped under the head table just in case, filled with kool-aid in a color to match your theme!\n\nNTA", "What is the point of a big, dramatic, all family present proposal anyway if everyone already learned about it on Facebook? Also, who are all these Facebook bullies that don't recognize rule number one of weddings and have time to spare harassing people they don't know? Are they for hire or something? \n\nNTA.", "NTA -A proposal at a fitting is way different than one at your wedding!", "NTA, trying to make your wedding about them is insanely selfish, and ***no one who has pressed you on this should be invited to the wedding***.  Supposed to be your day, they had the unmitigated gall to try to make your day about them and take the attention off you.  Uninvited and blocked, full stop.", "NTA - y'alls weddings, y'alls rules. Your other friends did not get engaged at your wedding - but a small gathering of friends during a fitting. \n\nI personally don't consider proposals at someone's wedding tacky, so long as the ones getting married are 100% on board.  Y'all are not okay with it and that is that. I'd stop replying to any sort of calls or texts about the ordeal. \"No\" was said and that is final.", "NTA.  Although, if you want to have some fun you could let them propose and then when it was over, you can ask when the baby is due.", "NTA a proposal at a dress fitting is massively diffrence to a proposal at a wedding,  ones a planning day out the other is the big main even.  No wonder they were trying to get thier guest list if they were awning on hijacking your wedding for thier proposal.  If they keep it up uninvite them.  If they are coming hire security and if they try it have them removed, warn them before hand that security has been told to remove them if they try to propose", "NTA", "So much NTA. They want you to fund their engagement party. Screw that", "NTA,  Why would these people even think this was ok,  this is your wedding and having them do this on your big day is just ignorant of them.   I would un-invite them because you know even if you say no they will do it anyway.", "BIG difference between a proposing at a dress fitting then at an actual wedding day.\n\nCousin is very rude for even thinking it's possible. I'd not be inviting that cousin because they'd do it anyway just to spite you.  NTA", "NTA A fitting isn't a wedding.", "NTA - it\u2019s one thing to propose at a private event leading up to the wedding, it is literally derailing your wedding so they can have a moment. You have spent so much time love money and care into planning this wedding, there is no reason it should be anyone else\u2019s day but you and your husbands", "NTA. Letting your friends get engaged at an outfit fitting is completely different to proposing at the actual wedding. Had the aunt lost her mind.", "You are not the asshole! That\u2019s YOUR DAY. Your wedding day. Not a dress fitting. & to your point of saying that if your husband to-be said no then your answer is also no- is super sweet. It\u2019s his day too & many women forget that \ud83e\udd17", "NTA. Your aunt sounds horrible.", "NTA you shouldn't even ask the bride or groom if you can propose at their wedding, it's their day to celebrate their commitment to each other. Other than being tacky, it's lazy, it shows that you can't be bothered to plan something meaningful and want to hijack someone else's day instead.", "Wtf NTA\n\nA dress fitting isn't your wedding ffs. It's two different events. One event it was okay, the other event it was not.\n\nYour wedding is about you getting married not someone else!!!!!! Sorry you're dealing with this nonsense.", "NTA. They\u2019re beyond tacky. I\u2019d be pissed if a boyfriend proposed to me at someone\u2019s wedding. Even if the bride and groom agreed. Just no.", "NTA\n\nFirst, your friends got engaged at a dress fitting, not your wedding. (Also yay for asking permission!)\n\nSecond is they are your MOH and Best Man, which usually means they are your respective BEST FRIENDS.\n\nSo even if you had said yes to them getting engaged at your wedding and no to the cousin, *that would be okay too*.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIt's common knowledge and common curtesy that you do not use someone else's big day to propose or announce any big life events. \n\nThese cousins are inconsiderate, entitled Aholes.", "NTA - you probably should have blocked her (and all of her minions) before, but definitely do it now. No one is entitled to access to you, and you deserve your peace. This aunt is toxic, get rid of her from your lives (and if you haven't already sent invites ...)", "NTA. There's a huge difference between getting engaged at a dress fitting and getting engaged at a wedding. Fianc\u00e9e's cousin is being obtuse for not seeing that. Weddings are meant to be about the couple, and any distractions, LIKE A PUBLIC PROPOSAL, should happen another time.", "NTA. People proposing at other peoples weddings is beyond tacky and not okay, especially when they actually bother to ask permission first and get offended at being denied. To me that sounds like a quick uninvite for the cousin!", "This is the best way to get uninvited from a wedding.\n\nNTA\n\nYWBTA to yourselves if you don\u2019t put a plan in place to stop them from doing it anyways at your wedding if they are still invited. Security or family security.", "Such bullshit.  You spend $ and enormous time in planning and attendance to create a wedding and a setting where you can get married and have the focus be on your day.\n\nNow these mooches want to ride on the coat tails of your money and time to propose in a nice settings.  A reception hall, music, dancing, food, service provided for you that they want to steal the spotlight.\n\nNo is no.  They can recreate all of this on their own dime and time and propose in a setting they went through the trouble of creating.  NTA 100%", "NTA. Their acting like you said they couldn't get engaged period. You're doing the cousin a favor, it's sooooo tacky to propose at someone else's wedding.

Hi Des love you see you this weekend!!!!\n\nHow to let everyone know you are a teenager practicing \"creative\" writing in 15 words or less.", "Getting engaged at the fitting is nowhere *near* the same thing as proposing at a wedding. NTA you need to make it completely, perfectly clear to him that if he chooses to do that, you both will go completely and permanently no contact with them. Though, it would probably just be better to uninvited all 3 of them.", "Imagine being so presumptuous as to think you had a *right* to get engaged on someone else's big day. To take away attention from the bride and groom for yourself. And, in effect, hijack their party which they are paying for. For yourself. **It's freeloading**! Definitely NTA.", "NTA.  A fitting is just a place where a group of friends happen to be at the same time, which is a good opportunity for something like a proposal.  No issues there at all.  A wedding is a place where TWO people are getting married.  Anything that distracts from that is, at best, rude and uncalled for.  If you had agreed, that's entirely up to you, and they should consider it a great honor to be allowed to share in your day that way.  It's certainly not something you owe them, though.", "NTA. A proposal (with the bride\u2019s permission) on a dress shopping experience is NOT the same as hijacking a wedding for your engagement party!\n\nThe simplest solution to their pestering you is to tell your harassers that if they make ONE more call, text, or email on the subject they are UNINVITED to your wedding. They can instead go to your cousin\u2019s since that is what they seem to think is more important.", "Definitely NTA for the not proposing at the wedding. Honestly, this is such a trope, that everyone would think the cousin was absolutely ridiculous and rude. There have been stories of the bride and groom okaying, or even suggesting, it, and still people are going to look down on the couple for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'm confused about why your fiance had a grouchy look for an hour and you guys didn't talk about it. Did the cousin just message your fiance an hour before? You were sitting next to him and he didn't say anything about it? Was he in agreement that your friends could get engaged at the fittings?", "Why do these AH want to steal some light from your wedding?  Tell them to take a hike.", "Nta", "NTA the two situations are completely different. I'd be petty though and agree with conditions, one of which was advanced payment of $xxx for their share of the venue for the proposal.", "NTA - a fitting is not same as a\nWedding", "NTA. There's a big difference between a dress fitting & a wedding. Pulling that shit at a wedding is just being cheap & lazy. They're trying to get a free party on the coattails of Your wedding. I'd uninvite them, since they sound like the type that would do it anyway. And make sure that you have security watching out for these people.", "NTA\n\n\nYou aren't paying good money to host their engagement.", "NTA, there is huge difference between getting engaged at a fitting and getting engaged at someone's wedding.", "Often wondered why people think they have a right to tell the bride or groom what they can and can\u2019t do at THEIR wedding. \nIt\u2019s always some aunt or cousin too. \nMaybe stay home", "NTA there is a HUGE difference between a dress/tux fitting, and your actual wedding, a party you are spending thousands to hold.", "Oh the kool-aid is a really nice touch!", "Odds are the aunt twisted the story some how, it's proably all of her HOA gossip group", "This is gold!", "Don't give us ideas", "Agree NTA - proposing at a bridal clothing store is a vastly different request than proposing at someone\u2019s wedding. The former is cute and fun, the latter is a massive overstep.", "I think the aunt has only child syndrome (but she wasn't an only child)", "My fiance has been really excited planning our wedding, so most of the things are his idea. Its so cute to see him so excited and happy to plan this", "This exactly! Anyone with sense would be able to see that!!", "Yes of Andy asked to propose at the wedding it wpuld have been a yes, but we would say after all of the speeches, dinner, and the first dance", "Do I got a story for you! Last month this aunt threw a fit about something, so her sister (my future mom) went to her house and took the invitation and said do bother after that bullshit!", "Ok, if that is what you think", "I don't see any negative or deleted comments so I gotta agree", "We are planning to announce a pregnancy at something big of theirs if they pull anything", "My fiance had just woken up when he saw the text and was upset, he wanted to calm down a little but before he talked with me. This cousin and him never really gotten along. He was agreed with our friends getting engaged, he was actually the one to set them up so he was crying more than I was", "> But I'm confused about why your fiance had a grouchy look for an hour and you guys didn't talk about it. \n\nbecause OP wrote that line as a sort of idiotic chekov's gun and didn't think about the practical ramifications.", "I'm the petty one in the relationship, my fiance would find it funny, but he wouldn't want it to be done", "Then again, HOAs tend to melt people\u2019s brains so twisting might not be necessary.", "Yes, I don\u2019t understand how other people aren\u2019t recognising this.

The internet is forever :)", "There's one comment that was removed within 17 seconds according to undit, so my guess is OP made that comment from a throwaway within the same browser she's using this account in, so reddit's AEO instantly removed it.", "Sounds fair to me!", "I would get your friends involved and warn them about specific people and have them ejected from the wedding if they try anything.", "YTA proposing at someone's wedding is tacky. Not only are they stealing the attention on your special day, they're taking advantage of the fact you're paying for their engagement party. I can't believe they thought that was okay!", "I would be tempted to tell them- if you are trying to find a polite way to say that you have a conflict and can't come to the wedding it's okay. we'd've understood, we've already updated aunt's, cousin's, and cousin's SO's RSVP to no. so it's not a big deal. but really, you didn't need to make a whole thing out of it.\n\njust act as if clearly they knew that this was ridiculous and they were trying to get themselves uninvited from the wedding.", "The friends who saw the comments are already makeing a game plan, which is scafy cause half of them are... well.... they worry me", "YTA means I am the asshole", "Did you mean NTA?", "I think you mean NTA, not YTA.", "Good idea - given the possibility of tensions and escalating events, excluding them from coming at all is likely for the best", "It sounds like this level of assholeness requires some asshole moves as retaliation. If your fiance's cousin won't drop the matter, just tell his girlfriend about his plans in advance."]}
