We of course said yes. It was beautiful and we all cried, and so did the workers. He gave a beautiful speech and ugh, it was so cute! I had taken a picture and posted it (with their permission) to congratulate them last friday. \n\nYesterday, I got an angry text message from my fiances cousin (m31) saying that I needed to have a talk with my fiance because he said no to the cousin proposing at our wedding. It was mildly funny because my fiance was sitting next to me at the table with a grouchy look on his face for the past hour, now I know why. I texted the cousin back and told him that if my fianc\u00e9 said no, I will as well.\n\nNow his mother, the same freaking aunt that had a melt down last month about who and who we aren'tinviting to the wedding, is calling and texting, and leaving notes on our facebook saying thay it was unfair to the cousin and his girlfriend that they couldn't get engaged at my wedding even though we let our friends get engaged.

If they refuse to pay up, they can stay home.", "NTA, you guys were at a \"FITTING\" not the fucking wedding, what part of this do they not get???\n\nWhat assholes.", "Uninvite them", "Just uninvite them. Or if you don\u2019t want to deal with that, task a bouncer or a groomsman with following them all night to make sure they don\u2019t pull anything. Do not, under any circumstances, let them have a mic. \n\nAlso, there is a world of difference between proposing at a dress fitting versus an actual wedding. If your aunt is too dense to see this, feel free to point it out. \n\nNTA", "Get the groomsmen ready to eject them both if they do it \u2014 discreetly but forcibly.  That will become their takeaway memory of their proposal, one that they can keep for the rest of their lives:  being marched by the collars and seat of the pants in opposite directions out of the venue, and being dropped on the curb at the ends of the block.  How romantic.  Let them know this will be the outcome.  Hopefully self-interest will dissuade them.", "Do not let them come to your wedding. You shouldn't have to be stressed out about making plans preemptively in regards to them not listening to your wishes. Sorry guys you're not invited!

Not sure what \"standards from other siblings\" means? I got to wear two sets of hand-me-downs and occasionally from my slightly older cousins also.  So, four sets of hand-me downs. Two hand-me-down bikes. Not much evidence of extra money there. They ganged up on me and there was no-one of my age. But it was all instrumental in me deciding not to have kids of my own. Oddly enough, all the older siblings/cousins did, so the childhood experience perhaps wasn't so bad for them.", "wait...so his cousin hasn't proposed and his mother posted publicly on FB that he wanted to propose at your wedding?\n\nCousin's mom kinda let the cat out of the bag didn't she?\n\nNTA by the way\n\nTell them that if they want your wedding to be their engagement party you expect them to pay half the receptions cost.", "Doesn't posting all over Facebook kind of ruin any potential surprises for the girlfriend anyway.

I\u2019m glad your in-laws shut it DOWN. \n\nOne thing we did to minimize shenanigans at our wedding was instruct our DJ to not bring extra mics.

Why would anybody think that's an acceptable thing to do? A dress fitting is not the same as a wedding. And you'd think the person proposing would want to do it at a time that the attention would be on them, not people actively getting married. Bizarre.", "NTA. Maybe hire security to be on the lookout in case they pull something. Tell them that their specific job is to watch the cousin and if he gets down on one knee they swoop in, scoop him up, and drop him outside.", "Didn't even have to read the story. NTA", "NTA.

Hope your wedding goes very well.", "NTA..I\u2019ve seen couples do this on say yes to the dress.  It\u2019s cute and makes the dress fitting more memorable.

IF they decline tell them they are not welcome at the wedding.", "NTA.  \nI'd give them an uninvite as soon as they asked, because I wouldn't trust them not to.", "NTA - it amazes me how many times this comes up, it\u2019s simple courtesy not to fuck with the bride and grooms night or you will be forever the AH.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA, there is a HUGE difference between proposing at a fitting and proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding.", "Isn't the engagement already 'spoiled' because it's being talked about all over social media. I mean, nobody can be 'surprised' by a proposal if everybody(!) has read the posts.", "NTA.  This is YOUR wedding.  Your WEDDING.  It's meant to be about YOU!\n\nA nice gesture would be to take a photo of the four of you at the wedding that they can then include in their announcement... AFTER.  Like at least a week!", "I am confused as to why the cousin is jealous. Your friends didn\u2019t have their proposal *at your wedding* but during the dress fitting. It\u2019s not the same thing, is it? NTA of course.", "NTA.... But its red flaggy for a guy to want to propose in front of his family... Not her family just his...

I bet that would shut them and their supporters up. So NTA.", "Why are so many people so delusional and entitled?! Can you rescind the invites for these folks?! NTA!", "NTA. Announcing an engagement at someone\u2019s wedding, is a major Faux Pas. ( extremely bad manners). Just as bad as a women wearing a long white gown at someone else\u2019s wedding.

I say tell them fine, with the condition that they pay half the wedding cost. I mean, the reception will go from your party to their party and it's only fair that they pay their share.

It would probably be for the best if you uninvited crazy aunt, her son, and her son's girlfriend from the wedding in addition to putting passwords in place for people to get into the wedding ceremony and the reception. Now, I'm a petty person so if I were in this situation, I'd get in contact with the cousin's girlfriend and let her know about his desire to propose to her at the wedding. Of course, she may have already found that out given the fact that her boyfriend's mother has done nothing but blast that information on social media which means it's only a matter of time until word gets to her if it hasn't already.", "NTA.

Stealing the light from a bride at her wedding is up there on the list of unforgivable sins.\n\nI think hijacking still carries a stiff penalty.Do they all live in the same trailer.\n\nEven most men, and we generally know nothing about social niceties like this, know enough that we will be branded with a 4 letter word on our forehead forever if ever did this.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why you can block on FB.
