The lecture portion is on zoom, and the lab is in person. \n\nI went to the campus library and realized I forgot my headphones. I left and found a semi-secluded picnic table outside to not disturb anyone in the library. \n\n\nThe lecture started. A few minutes later another girl sat down next to the adjacent picnic table with her book. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her glancing at me and she sighed every time I spoke into the mic to ask a question. \n\n\nShe asked if I could turn down the volume. I said sure no problem. But then she kept complaining it\u2019s still \u201creally loud\u201d and it\u2019s \u201crude to play videos out loud in a public space\u201d. \n\nI explained to her I forgot my headphones and left the library and that\u2019s why I sat here FIRST. I told her I turned it down a little bit but I still need to listen so it\u2019s gonna be audible. The volume was at 25% on my Mac if that makes sense? \n\nShe asked if I\u2019m really playing the \u201cI was here first\u201d card and said to go somewhere else since these tables are the only shady spot on campus.  \n\n\nI said no, you can move. I\u2019m ending the conversation now. She called me \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and muttered \u201cbitch\u201d under her breath when she left. Apparently she complained to the security guy on the golf cart I\u2019m being rude. \n\n\nHe came over and said next time to move or go in my car. (I don\u2019t have a car). He shrugged and said I\u2019m an adult now and this is why I need to be prepared. \n\nI had frustrated tears after since confrontation is challenging for me and I was already stressed for my exam. This is the first time I forgot my headphones. I\u2019m just baffled how bothered everyone was. The tables were empty when I got there! Like she could\u2019ve left if it was that bad\u2026 \n\nPlus it\u2019s not like sitting outside on campus is quite. It\u2019s loud. There\u2019s tons of students walking and chatting. She could\u2019ve went to the library if she wanted absolute silence. A few of my friends said I should\u2019ve just moved since you\u2019re automatically the asshole if you have videos on speaker in public. \n\nAITA? \n\n**EDIT: for clarification I was NOT in the library. I was outside (far away from class rooms and the library) at a shady picnic bench. It\u2019s a secluded area. ** I randomly stumbled upon it while wandering around trying to find somewhere to sit to not bother anyone. No one else was there when I sat down. \n\n\nAlso there are only 2 unused lecture rooms at the library, and both were being used. Both require 48hour reservation ahead. **However I will buy a cheap pair of headphones to keep in my bag at all times so this doesn\u2019t happen again!! Thanks peeps.**\n\n**TL;DR**: My lecture was online. I forgot my headphones and had to play my video out loud.

All the best in your studies OP.", "NTA. You were in the spot first and when asked lowered your volume to a reasonable level.

Having an extra pair in your bag is always a good idea.", "NTA. You went outside, away from classrooms and the library and sat in a space completely alone. She came to where YOU were sitting and then acted like an immature brat. I loathe having to listen to other people's conversations, videos, music in a public space (like on public transportation or at the airport) but this is clearly different. You didn't do anything wrong and she could have easily gotten up and moved. You were already playing the video when she sat down, she can't act shocked you continued to listen. It seems like she was just gearing up to argue with someone for no reason. \n\nI'm annoyed with all the people saying YTA. Do they expect complete silence outside on a college campus? Are these people okay?", "NTA. It's not reasonable to expect silence in an outdoor area, and even if you'd had your headphones she still would have been mad that you were talking to ask questions.

She should have moved away to begin with.  Good luck with your studies!", "NTA there is no expectation of silence in such a place.

Honestly, if I were in your shoes I'd do the same thing. It may be a social taboo to be blaring music and tiktoks on your phone but you found a secluded spot and noises from a lecture are wayyy different than an annoying 6 second video of someone screaming. The person who came up to you seems like more of the AH here. I mean who comes up to someone else's spot they were at first and makes demands like that to a stranger? Weird as hell. Even more so, you were outdoors, which is way different than being indoors sitting next to someone blaring noise. The other person could have found a different spot. I would never even sit at a spot that's already taken to begin with.", "NTA. \n\nThese things happen -- people forget headphones, wallets, whatever. It sounds like you took reasonable steps and you were *outside*. It might annoy people to hear your lecture, but if you are *outside* then they can go other places, in or out.

She is reading a book. You're using a laptop. You need the shade more than she does. Just because what she is doing is quiet doesn't automatically give her priority and yes it does matter if someone is there first doing their business before her.\n\nHow does security dumbass think he is justified in telling you to move?

Its much easier to tune out 2 people having a conversation that it is to tune out one person listening to music nearby.", "NTA you did the best you could in a hard situation. One suggestion- some school libraries may have headphones you can lend out. A lot of libraries now do more than just books. I would ask a library clerk if they have headphones you can use if this happens again.\n\n Overall though that girl was being ridiculous to demand you move. She picked her spot to sit outside in a public space and presumably she could hear the video playing before she sat down.

Unless there was a sign next to the tables that stated for quiet study only you were within your rights to continue to watch your lecture, even without headphones. The reader was in the wrong as she came up after you had already started the lecture and I assume she knew about the noise happening before she settled in. \n\nNOW if you had been having a phone conversation on speaker while in a grocery or retail store or a restaurant then I would tell you to go sit barebutted on some hot bricks because that crap is annoying AF.", "NTA\n\nI was so ready to say YTA by the title because it's one of my pet peeves when people play their music on the bus or metro. But no, you are definitely NTA here, OP. You were *outside* and in  a public place, which means that people can use the space how they like (within limitations of course) but you weren't doing anything wrong.

I also went to a small school.", "on the subway? yes. at a picnic? no lol", "Then don\u2019t go to a college campus lol", "There\u2019s people who really think they shouldn\u2019t hear the presence of any other living person when they\u2019re in a public space, and y\u2019all think you\u2019re not the AHs.", "And if you're THAT sensitive to noise then why choose to sit where OP is sitting and sitting there knowing full well they were listening to a lecture at low volume? This isn't on OP at all. It's on the female that sat there and expected OP to cater to her. Where there are probably a ton of other places to sit.", "Yeah maybe! It\u2019s considered very rude here.", "Lets say the OP was playing music and it was disturbing others - playing music is usually considered rude.", "This is not about a conversation. This is about a loudspeaker.", "Haha Im sure you just \u201casked one of your classmates!\u201d How convenient for you ;)", "ITS FUCKING PUBLIC. IT IS A SHARED COMMUNAL SPACE. People can do whatever they want in public for the most part as long as they are not a threat to others, running around naked, or doing something that disturbs or upsets everyone in that communal space. OP found a semi secluded spot to listen to their lecture and wasn't blasting it loud for the whole area to hear. Could it have been annoying? Sure. But people don't get to walk into an area and then demand you move because they want this area for quiet reading when it's not the library!", "Nah I wouldn\u2019t be pissed. I\u2019ve only said that playing music or a lecture out loud in annoying. They don\u2019t have to adapt to how my college acts but everyone saying that the is normal on a college campus is not inherently true.\n\nETA: I\u2019m saying OP is an AH because they are annoying.", "It wasn't private though, it was an outdoor picnic table", "This is not a proper comparison but honestly I rarely answer my phone in public. But answering the phone or having a short conversation is still acceptable. Listening to an entire lecture, no. The lecture was something scheduled that OP knew about, they made the mistake of leaving their headphones at home, onus is on them to make suitable alternative arrangements.", "So glad people in both my uni campuses were not like this. We never had problems sharing tables. No one ever needed a whole picnic table to themselves.", "Maybe I wouldn\u2019t know unless I was there", "That\u2019s never been a problem at my campus and I\u2019ve been here for four years", "And OP doesn\u2019t own the outside space either. It\u2019s just rude to do. It\u2019s not a federal offense, it\u2019s just a modern rudeness that was met with a rude reaction. They\u2019re even. Not sure why you need me to change my mind about it so badly?", "My college was very loud outside & people would honestly play music and dance and stuff. Outside the library was especially busy and social. But they also had silent floors inside for people who weren\u2019t up for that. So just different experiences I guess.", "Okay, but OP wasn\u2019t playing music. He was doing something that would be more comparable to having a quiet conversation..", "I did. I\u2019m grading a science showdown with her.", "Again still annoying still an AH move", "the fact that you\u2019re basing \u201cnormal on college campuses\u201d on *your* experience is closed minded imo.", "Where nobody else was around until a girl came up and harassed them.", "Exactly..public. You are the entitled asshole in this situation for asserting that your right to use and enjoy the public space is greater than his.\n\nAs long as his volume is no greater than normal conversation level you can just go sit at the next free table if you want quiet.\n\nWould he equally be an asshole if he was sat having a chat with a friend and this girl rocked up demanding silence?", "And by the time you've done that you've probably missed the lecture. \n\nThis girl could have chosen to sit anywhere else on this massive planet but she insisted on sitting there and asserting her right to the space as more important. \n\nIt would have been no different if op was simply sat talking to a friend or two. Similar noise levels... Should they all move just try to accommodate this needy person?\n\nThere is no reasonable expectation that a shared public space is quiet space unless explicitly designated.", "It doesn\u2019t matter ? Tf it\u2019s like if me and my friends are playing dnd at a picnic table and you come up and sit with us and some dumb shit like \u201c can you guys quit playing this game I\u2019m trying to study?\u201d  We would laugh your ass outta there. That doesn\u2019t make us assholes nor does it you but expecting someone to stop doing what they are doing when you come up is idiotic.", "They weren\u2019t even playing music\u2026and their volume was lower than a conversation which you says does happen on your campus in many comments lol", "it isn\u2019t particularly rude though. i have a macbook, and with my speakers at 25% i struggle to hear it clearly if im anywhere that isnt quiet. 25% volume on a mac is lower than most conversations would be. OP was trying to be as unobtrusive as possible in that situation, and when you use a public outdoor space it comes with the implicit understanding that there will be things going on that make noise. if you absolutely cannot handle even a conversational level of noise, dont use outdoor public spaces without your own accommodations. \n\nOP *had* to be on campus for their lab, and *had* to attend the virtual lecture, so they found somewhere that would allow them to do both while disturbing a minimal number of people. the girl who wanted to read should have found somewhere else to be (like the library) if she needed peace and quiet to read", "I'm just offering my opinion, the same as you.", "For some reason, having two people talking isn't a problem for me as much (maybe because of the time involved or you know its socialization).  What the OP did was more closer to having a phone call or video call on speaker/no headphones.  That is generally annoying/rude to do in public.", "He forgot his headphones and was an hour away by bus you want him to miss his lecture for the sake of having a public space (which already has plenty of noise) be quiet? He's NTA here. The asshole is the entitled girl who wanted to read *aesthetically* at a table on campus and got all out out when the person who was there first wouldn't move or turn off their lecture so she could have her main character moment. \n\n\nOP don't listen to these people you're NTA.", "I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m saying that others have said that a bunch of noise on campus is the normal and I am pointing out that I have not experienced that.", "The girl had every right to go there, it's a public area. OP should not have been listening to their lecture in public without headphones. They know they had the lecture, onus is on them to make sure they prepped for it. So many options on their part but they chose to be an AH.", "No, having a conversation or group discussion is different but I would argue that even for that it would be best to book a private room. Guess I'm not used to american campus cultural norms.", "Look the girl could have been nicer for sure. But expecting people to be okay to listen to whatever is coming out of your device is very inconsiderate. The lecture was not some sudden thing, it was something scheduled, OP could have been better planned/prepared. This is on them. And it's an online lecture, wouldn't there be a recording if they miss it anyway?", "Laughing at someone who asked you to be quieter so they can study on a uni campus is pretty AH-esque.", "So you think it\u2019s appropriate to approach someone who was FaceTiming & then get annoyed you were around someone who was FaceTiming & tell them they need to leave?", "I never said OP should miss their lecture", "The way I interpreted it was more like multiple people told you it\u2019s normal, but since it\u2019s not normal at your school, it\u2019s not normal at all. But i don\u2019t think that\u2019s  the way you meant it, just how it seemed to me ig", "The girl had every right to go there! The OP let her sit with them and had no issue with the girl whatsoever. But if you want silence, go to the library. A lecture on a computer at low volume is not disturbing, especially on a college campus. And if you\u2019re disturbed by that, move five feet over or go to another picnic table."]}
