The lecture portion is on zoom, and the lab is in person. \n\nI went to the campus library and realized I forgot my headphones. I left and found a semi-secluded picnic table outside to not disturb anyone in the library. \n\n\nThe lecture started. A few minutes later another girl sat down next to the adjacent picnic table with her book. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her glancing at me and she sighed every time I spoke into the mic to ask a question. \n\n\nShe asked if I could turn down the volume. I said sure no problem. But then she kept complaining it\u2019s still \u201creally loud\u201d and it\u2019s \u201crude to play videos out loud in a public space\u201d. \n\nI explained to her I forgot my headphones and left the library and that\u2019s why I sat here FIRST. I told her I turned it down a little bit but I still need to listen so it\u2019s gonna be audible. The volume was at 25% on my Mac if that makes sense? \n\nShe asked if I\u2019m really playing the \u201cI was here first\u201d card and said to go somewhere else since these tables are the only shady spot on campus.  \n\n\nI said no, you can move. I\u2019m ending the conversation now. She called me \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and muttered \u201cbitch\u201d under her breath when she left. Apparently she complained to the security guy on the golf cart I\u2019m being rude. \n\n\nHe came over and said next time to move or go in my car. (I don\u2019t have a car). He shrugged and said I\u2019m an adult now and this is why I need to be prepared. \n\nI had frustrated tears after since confrontation is challenging for me and I was already stressed for my exam. This is the first time I forgot my headphones. I\u2019m just baffled how bothered everyone was. The tables were empty when I got there! Like she could\u2019ve left if it was that bad\u2026 \n\nPlus it\u2019s not like sitting outside on campus is quite. It\u2019s loud. There\u2019s tons of students walking and chatting. She could\u2019ve went to the library if she wanted absolute silence. A few of my friends said I should\u2019ve just moved since you\u2019re automatically the asshole if you have videos on speaker in public. \n\nAITA? \n\n**EDIT: for clarification I was NOT in the library. I was outside (far away from class rooms and the library) at a shady picnic bench. It\u2019s a secluded area. ** I randomly stumbled upon it while wandering around trying to find somewhere to sit to not bother anyone. No one else was there when I sat down. \n\n\nAlso there are only 2 unused lecture rooms at the library, and both were being used. Both require 48hour reservation ahead. **However I will buy a cheap pair of headphones to keep in my bag at all times so this doesn\u2019t happen again!! Thanks peeps.**\n\n**TL;DR**: My lecture was online. I forgot my headphones and had to play my video out loud.

She made a fuss about it. She could have multitasked and put headphones on to block your sound. She was being difficult. Some people have nothing better to do. All the best in your studies OP.", "NTA. You were in the spot first and when asked lowered your volume to a reasonable level. Not to mention you made sure the spot was secluded away from the more opened areas. If you were still inside of the library and building that would be a different situation however you were outside.\n\nDid you see if the library had some headphones they would\u2019ve let you borrow? Having an extra pair in your bag is always a good idea.", "NTA. You went outside, away from classrooms and the library and sat in a space completely alone. She came to where YOU were sitting and then acted like an immature brat. I loathe having to listen to other people's conversations, videos, music in a public space (like on public transportation or at the airport) but this is clearly different. You didn't do anything wrong and she could have easily gotten up and moved. You were already playing the video when she sat down, she can't act shocked you continued to listen. It seems like she was just gearing up to argue with someone for no reason. \n\nI'm annoyed with all the people saying YTA. Do they expect complete silence outside on a college campus? Are these people okay?", "NTA. It's not reasonable to expect silence in an outdoor area, and even if you'd had your headphones she still would have been mad that you were talking to ask questions. It's pretty infuriating that she bothered a security guard over it (and that he took her side).", "Nta you did everything you could to minimize your sound and the inconvenience to other students. Im surprised the campus cop took her seriously and didn't just laugh in her face. \n\nI will say though the library probably has headphones to rent with your student ID.", "NTA.

NTA", "I usually automatically jump to Y T A to playing anything audible in public because its annoying.  But listening to a lecture outside at a picnic table rather than disturbing anyone in the library?  NTA.  I'm assuming she could hear the lecture when she sat down and sat down anyway.  She should have moved away to begin with.  Good luck with your studies!", "NTA there is no expectation of silence in such a place.

You tried to be nice, the other person wasn\u2019t.", "**NTA**\n\nIt sounds like you genuinely forgot headphones, tried your absolute best to not disturb anyone and the person who sat down near you was pretty unreasonable. You were very polite and considerate to both parties. After the first contact I would prbably have told both of them to fuck off.

The amount of people in the comments who are sitting upon their high horses like \u201cyou need to be prepared like an adult\u201d is a lot higher than I would have thought.

I guess those people have never forgotten anything ever, so like, kudos to them.\n\nSure playing audio out loud is a social faux pas but you tried to rectify the situation in a reasonable way.", "NTA - That is all perfectly reasonable and you dealt with it appropriately.\n\nThe other girl was a bit entitled imo, you were already there so she entered the proximity knowing that the sound of the lecture was audible. She chose to put herself there. So yes you are playing the \u2018I was here first card\u2019 and legitimately.\n\nThis other girl reminds me of one of those people that watches a tv show and is offended by it, so instead of switching it off they watch the whole show, count the number of times they were offended then lodge a complaint.

Look you're not the bad guy for forgetting your earphones but you are also not the good guy in this. You f***ed up and now you won't do it again (hopefully).", "NTA. Honestly, if I were in your shoes I'd do the same thing. It may be a social taboo to be blaring music and tiktoks on your phone but you found a secluded spot and noises from a lecture are wayyy different than an annoying 6 second video of someone screaming. The person who came up to you seems like more of the AH here. I mean who comes up to someone else's spot they were at first and makes demands like that to a stranger? Weird as hell. Even more so, you were outdoors, which is way different than being indoors sitting next to someone blaring noise. The other person could have found a different spot. I would never even sit at a spot that's already taken to begin with.", "NTA. \n\nThese things happen -- people forget headphones, wallets, whatever. It sounds like you took reasonable steps and you were *outside*. It might annoy people to hear your lecture, but if you are *outside* then they can go other places, in or out. And if the sound really bothers them, why don't they put on headphones? Or leave?\n\nI don't believe that \"I was here first\" is a blanket excuse or reason for everything, but I do think it counts for something here.\n\nGood luck with the class.", "NTA, you took the effort to be away from others and it was a lecture, you weren't blasting music or a movie. The other student could obviously hear what you were doing and sat down anyways. But as some others have said, libraries usually have cheap earbuds for sale if that happens again.", "NTA, it's a public outdoor area, if people had been chatting nearby would she have complained to get them to shut up?\n\nIt's the only shady spot is her justification for not moving? She is reading a book. You're using a laptop. You need the shade more than she does. Just because what she is doing is quiet doesn't automatically give her priority and yes it does matter if someone is there first doing their business before her.\n\nHow does security dumbass think he is justified in telling you to move? It's an outdoor area! People make noise. It's not the interior of the library.", "I normally HATE it when people are playing videos in public like that, but you were in a secluded area and she came and sat down near you when you had it already playing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You did what you could. Have you considered earbuds? Inexpensive, easier to stow than headphones and you can take them anywhere", "Yes, YTS", "NTA", "NTA - you were outside and took reasonable steps to be away from and not disturb others. If she wanted quiet, she could have gone into the library. Not using headphones inside is super annoying, but you were outside in a place that had been empty before you got there.", "Esh \n\nBring your headphones\nShe could always move", "NTA you were outside by yourself", "NTA because this was an emergency type situation. As long as you try to make sure it doesn't happen again (which it sounds like you have), then it's fine.", "NTA and tell the security guard to eat a dick.  outside in public there is all kinds of noise that could disturb people.  if the other girl wanted quiet the library is also \"shaded\" from the sun.", "NTA you tried not to bother anyone and even found a secluded space, she went out of her way to complicate things she could have easily left", "NTA\n\nI understand the sentiment that 'no videos on speaker in the public' and I would normally agree that you would be the asshole.\n\nBut you forgot your headphones and you calmly explained the other girl the situation.\n\nAnd God, I hate people without empathy.", "> confrontation is challenging for me\n\nThen stop annoying people.\n\n~~YTA~~\n\noh go on then, she was seeking out conflict, so ESH", "YTA.\n\nThere is a difference between the ambient noise of outside, and someone listening to a lecture.  It IS rude to listen to something like this out loud.  Like, have you ever ridden a bus or a train.  Its much easier to tune out 2 people having a conversation that it is to tune out one person listening to music nearby.", "NTA you did the best you could in a hard situation. One suggestion- some school libraries may have headphones you can lend out. A lot of libraries now do more than just books. I would ask a library clerk if they have headphones you can use if this happens again.\n\n Overall though that girl was being ridiculous to demand you move. She picked her spot to sit outside in a public space and presumably she could hear the video playing before she sat down. If she doesn't like it, she needs to pick a different spot.", "NTA. you took it upon yourself to make sure you were disturbing anyone by not only going outside but going outside where no one was present.", "YTA\n\nThe only reason why it\u2018s quiet enough outside in a public space for you to hear your lecture good enough to follow it is because it\u2018s a public consent (social rule?) NOT to play loud music or lectures.\n\nNow you\u2018re breaking the rule because you forgot your headphones. Imagine everyone would break the rule because of some reason. It would be unbearable.\n\nThere are secluded study rooms that you can book. They may cost a buck or two for an hour. Find another solution.", "YTA\n\nPublic spaces are not for people play video with sound.", "NTA.. as an adult you are also entitled to using your laptop with sound in an area you find away from everyone", "NTA and next time ask the librarians if they have headphones.

I\u2019m shocking myself by going with NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou were on campus doing school related stuff. Unless there was a sign next to the tables that stated for quiet study only you were within your rights to continue to watch your lecture, even without headphones. The reader was in the wrong as she came up after you had already started the lecture and I assume she knew about the noise happening before she settled in. \n\nNOW if you had been having a phone conversation on speaker while in a grocery or retail store or a restaurant then I would tell you to go sit barebutted on some hot bricks because that crap is annoying AF.", "NTA\n\nI was so ready to say YTA by the title because it's one of my pet peeves when people play their music on the bus or metro. But no, you are definitely NTA here, OP. You were *outside* and in  a public place, which means that people can use the space how they like (within limitations of course) but you weren't doing anything wrong.

I'm someone with adhd and focus issues, so both forgetting things and being bothered by other peoples noises is something I'm familiar with. I've tried to do the college thing like... 5 times in my life too. \n\nIf I'm somewhere like... say, in one of the library's \"quiet areas\" I will lose my cool if someone has something on loud enough I can hear it. If someone is playing something in a public space so loudly I can't hear myself think over it, that's a problem. I even find myself annoyed when someone decides to play their music out loud in the grocery store because dude you can definitely go without your jams for however long you'll be here. \n\nBut you were on a college campus, forgot your headphones, left the library/general public quiet areas where you not having headphones would actively distract other people, be rude, or inconsiderate. And when this chick asked you to turn it down, you did! You were outside for crying out loud. \n\nIf she wanted a quiet outdoor space to study... well, around where I live, good luck lady. But that's also why if I know I'm going somewhere where other people might be but I need to focus, I carry either my noise canceling ear buds or my ear plugs. I try to keep at least a pair of cheap earplugs in my bag at all times just in case I forget both the good ones and my headphones (which happens to me sometimes because of who I am as a person lol) \n\nBecause you were in an outdoor, public space that wasn't  a designated quiet area, and because you did turn down your audio some when she requested it, and you were there first (because in my experience with college \"they were there first\" was honestly a factor that was considered for how people were using a space tbh) you were NTA in any way shape or form. Most college students will understand the struggle of \"oh fudge I forgot my headphones\" and won't be mad as long as you're not being disrespectful or disruptive with your audio. \n\nBut pro tip - go to a dollar store or something and buy a really cheap pair of backup headphones just in case. My dollar store once had some on clearance for like $2 and I bought like 5 pairs and I'd keep 2-3 of them in my backpack at all times. That way I had extra in case one pair broke or something and if someone was really really bothering me with their audio I could be like \"hey dude I'm having a crazy hard time focusing and I don't mean to be intrusive but if I give you these headphones would you mind using them since your video is distracting me a bit?\" And if they said no I'd be like \"okay no worries I understand\" and that would be that.", "I hate people who have volume on in public, its rude, its selfish, anc its annoying.

It was awful and greatly added to my frustration, especially since he was in the only part of the seating that I got enough reception to try and find an uber or lyft. But you are NTA. You needed to be in class, found a secluded place alone and started your class. Some girl went I wanna sit here you need to leave your class because its annoying me.

Would she have asked 2 people to text each other instead of talking vocally because it's inconsiderate to make any noise around other ppl in public????? It makes sense if it's on a train or something to use headphones instead to listen to music or watch a movie because the other passengers are trapped there with you and can't leave to avoid it. This student was free to leave if she didn't like ambient sounds in the place she chose to read.

The two situations aren't even remotely the same. Anyone playing music or videos on public transportation or in restaurants and most other public settings is automatically a giant asshole.\n\nTrying to find somewhere remote where you won't bother people like OP did is completely different.
