My FMIL has been a pain to deal with since we announced our engagement. From insisting she wants decorations to be a certain color, the venue, the bride dress. She has tried to make our wedding like its hers basically. It came all to a halt when she said since my fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t like the wedding dress she insisted that she will wear it to the wedding. \n\nWe think this comes from her not having a wedding. My fianc\u00e9e was a surprise baby, her parents hadn\u2019t married yet and couple of months after she was born father died in a work accident. Since then she never married let alone getting a boyfriend. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e let her mother have some power over somethings, as long as it was within budget and the theme we want. Well that didn\u2019t last and after almost a year we are exhausted. The problem is, invitations have already been sent. We talked about the idea of just uninviting her but this is not the first time something like this happened. During my fiancee cousin\u2019s wedding, she was uninvited for similar reasons (she was criticizing everything and trying to push her ideas)and still showed up. \n\nSo I suggested to just tell her that we had a change of heart and wanted to surprise her with her favorite venue. So she would be around 4 hrs away from ours. Contacting everyone else to shut their months and just nod if she asks about the change. \n\nWell, my fiancee is on the fence. She loves her mother dearly and wants her to attend but the dress incident is something she doesn\u2019t want to happen to her. FMIL outside of the wedding topic, she is a good person. \n\nWe managed to make her drop the topic and have been keeping tabs on her and so far no bride dresses or similar has been brought. WIBTA if i lie to my FMIL, giving her a different venue address as a precaution?\n\nUpdate: I accept your judgement of me being the AH. I talked to my fiancee and we will talk to her mother again and make sure she understands our concerns and will give her an ultimatum about the dress. If she come to the wedding with any type of dress resembling a bride dress she will be quick out of the wedding.", "created_utc": 1685909110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140olee/wibta_if_i_give_my_future_mil_the_wrong_address/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you lost your mind? \n\n>Well, my fiancee is on the fence. She loves her mother dearly and wants her to attend.\n\nYou two are adults. There are mature ways to deal with problematic relatives. Your fianc\u00e9e clearly does **not** want to destroy the relationship with her mother, so drop this childish idea of sending her on a wild goose chase to your wedding. Find a different solution.", "YWBTA. I understand you are frustrated, but this will be humiliating for your FMIL and severely damage any further relationship between the three of you. Plus you would be asking your other guests to be complicit in a lie and they might find that really uncomfortable / be unwilling to jeopardize their relationship with her for this scheme. \n\nI would recommend sitting her down and making clear (her daughter needs to take the lead in laying this out) one more time that it is not acceptable for her to do X [wear a bridal gown, for example] and that hence forth she can expect that if she crosses those boundaries in discussions leading up to the event, you and your bride-to-be will firmly but lovingly shut it down (example: \u201cMom / HerName, we are not going to do X and won\u2019t discuss it any further. If you can\u2019t respect that, we\u2019ll hang up / leave now. When you are ready to move on, please reach out.\u201d) \n\nFor the wedding itself, you can hire a bouncer to refuse her entry if she arrives in the dress (give them her picture) or enlist the help of a close friend to monitor her during the event for other issues (e.g. ensuring she doesn\u2019t get the mic if she\u2019s indicated she plans to say something inappropriate, watching her alcohol intake if that\u2019s an issue, etc). Work with your vendors to password-protect any accounts you have if you are concerned she\u2019ll call and pretend to make \u201cauthorized\u201d changes on your behalf.  \n\nSince you say she is an otherwise lovely woman, consider sitting down with your wife after the wedding and thinking through what might help her resolve any lingering issues (does she need a nudge towards therapy? might you be willing to throw her a milestone blowout birthday to give her a chance to be the center of attention? would it be helpful to talk with her about her struggles as a single mom and honor her commitment to her daughter out loud?). When someone who we love and like is behaving badly, it\u2019s absolutely ok to call them on it, but it can also help to ask ourselves / them why if this is out of character.", "Are you a child or an adult? Because giving somebody the wrong address sounds like something a child would do.\n\nAct lie a grown up. Either uninvite her or not. But giving a wrong address is just plain childish!\n\nYWBTA!", "YTA. Do the responsible adult thing and employ open honest direct and respectful communication.", "YTA.   Jesus.  As bad as she could possibly be, you\u2019d be worse doing that.  How about an adult conversation.", "Yta. One, just own up and tell her to back off or she's uninvited. Two, she's going to find out the right address from someone and the drama will be worse (expect her to show up at the og venue and make a huge scene).", ">Contacting everyone else to shut their months and just nod if she asks about the change.\n\nYTA don't involve wedding guests in your lies", "Yes, YWBTA.  Trickery is not the way adults handle situations with their parents and/or future in-laws.  Is the bride not going to see her mother the morning of the wedding?  No one is going to talk to FMIL or go to the ceremony with her?  You expect literally everyone to collude with you in this plot?  Dude.  No.  Just no.", "Before lying, I'd probably sit her down as a couple and say \"do you know how awful you have made this wedding planning for us? Are you aware we are on the verge and rescinding your invitation and hiring security to escort you out if you turn up because, while we love you, you have been a nightmare during this process and the suggestion of wearing a wedding dress and upstanding your daughter makes us not want you there.\"", "YWBTA. The only reason to do this would be if you slash want to go NC.\n\nJust tell her that if she comes in a wedding dress or anything that looks like bridal attire she's getting bounced.", "YWBTA. Because it's going to be discovered eventually, and that will only make MIL angry and hurt her relationship w/her daughter.\n\nIt looks like she'll show up anyway, so I'd say just suck it up.\n\nOnly other option would be to the cancel the wedding and elope.", "Yes, YTA. Has either of you sat down and had a respectful conversation about her behaviour. Acknowledging her past. Pointing it out may allow her to self correct (or not) but I\u2019d at least give her a chance. \n\nLots of other ways this could be handled, but I wouldn\u2019t pick this one.", "Get security. Anyone showing up in a wedding dress is being bounced.", "YTA you suck op", "YTA yeah she shouldn\u2019t be so heavily involved but to give her a fake address is just unnecessarily cruel", "ESH\n\nMIL has a controlling attitude for which it would be best if she seeks help from a therapist to overcome traumas, if she has had any. She can't decide, it's not her marriage and she's being nasty.\r  \nBut lying is very immature, that's something teenagers would do, not adults. As adults we confronts, argue, keep the point: in a word, we communicate. Is it tiring? Oh boi, it is, but it's the right way to deal with problems. Tricking her will cause an irreparable rift between the two of you and her.\r  \nBe blunt if you have to, give an ultimatum if you see MIL insisting on her positions. Tell her there will be security at the wedding and if she shows up, things will be different from the  cousin's wedding.", "YWBTA", "YTA the daughter needs to tell her mother although she loves her dearly she is tired of getting wedding ideas pushed on her. That is she continues she will be uninvited. If she shows up anyway there will be security and she will be escorted off the premises. If she shows up wearing a wedding dress or white of any kid she will be escorted of the premises.\n\nIf she wants to come she is to keep her options to herself. If her options are wanted they will be asked for. If she can\u2019t do this she will be uninvited to the wedding and escorted away if she shows up. These are her only options there is no more negotiating. \n\nStart setting boundaries now. If you and your fianc\u00e9 decide to have kids in the future she will be just as bad. Start setting boundaries. Let her know the consequences if she continues with actions the two of you do not like.", "YTA this is incredible mean. I get she is annoying. But also ether ignore everything until the wedding and invite her or uninvite her. But this is really mean. Also, she probably as you explained is so much involved because she didn't have a wedding. Talk to her about no more wedding talk etc. Or uninvite her but being so mean to give her to her daughter's wedding the wing address. You will stain the relationship. This is just cruel.", "Wow mil sounds ridiculous. \n\nIt\u2019s a rough one for me since your fianc\u00e9 is letting her do more crap than she probably should be. Buut even so YWBTA if you did it, especially if you both aren\u2019t on board. Your fiance though should put her foot down.", "YWBTA\n\n\nYou and your fiancee should be adults and talk to your future MIL and set some boundaries", "YTA. This would be an abominably cruel thing to do", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NTA, since you say there\u2019s literally nothing you can do to prevent her from showing up and ruining the wedding, you\u2019d be within your rights. \n\nWith that said, I doubt your fianc\u00e9e is willing to completely destroy her relationship with her mother, which is what this would do. I also doubt it would work - someone would let something spill. It sounds like not a very good plan. So I\u2019d recommend finding some sort of compromise because I don\u2019t think this solution will lead to much marital felicity", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
