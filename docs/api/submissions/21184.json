(My partner, his mom, and our two small children.)\n\nI would come home hungry [from 13H shifts]  to find my gluten-free takeout eaten, 95% of the time by my partner. Or they would order in \"for everyone\"and not get one GF item in the menu, not even a plain salad. Also, I fry A TON of chicken in gluten-free bread crumbs every week that is for everyone to enjoy, but when I have a run of shifts in a row and can't cook anything additional for myself, they don't care, they try to feed it to our picky 2yo [which means it lands in the garbage] and eat it themselves. All of it, leaving me with nothing, then have the nerve to ask me why I'm so tired and not eating. \n\nNever mind that there are ingredients to cook whatever they like, plus tons of fruit and even ice cream. Forget all the take out restaurants within less than a mile that they can order from and I can't. When they're hungry they don't care that I will not just come home hungry, but also go to sleep that way. \n\n In all fairness, it also took my MIL a long time to even understand my disorder. She would try to cook for me, but use ingredients that have gluten in them and tell me she cooked GF, (ex: soy sauce with veggies, or GF pasta with non-GF seasonings). None of it was malicious, but did lead to many flares and now I trust nothing, even in my own home, unless I make it. \n\nIt took a few flip outs and locking up my GF snacks and cooking ingredients to get them to stop. I think all they managed to learn from it was that if at any point a food item was in my possession, or it existed in our fridge without it ever being something they chose or bought they better not touch it without asking first. (Common courtesy to me, but I guess I'm crazy? )\n\nPeople who don't live your life don't understand your struggles. Teenagers especially don't know the complexities of your disease, or that it can kill you if you ignore your diet and how hard it can be to get food that is safe for you. Honestly, you can't expect them to, either. \n\nI suggest a separate mini-fridge just for your food, possibly even lock it. And, yes, flip out and be an AH as many times as it takes to drill into their heads that their actions only have consequences and suffering for you, and they better start respecting that they can't just eat your food.", "NTA. Teenagers are old enough to know that they need to leave your stuff alone.", "NTA The solution here is to simply only buy what you can eat and what's on your diet.

Basically, separate things that are safe for you from the main refrigerator.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019d get a cabinet that is separate for any snack foods that are safe for you. \n\nIf they still go looking for your food, then you stop buying the \u201cnormal\u201d stuff and just buy the food safe for you to eat.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd seriously. Stop buying the other stuff. Clearly they will eat your stuff. Screw what their preferences are. They seem to be preferring what you need.", "NTA but you have to set better boundaries. Just tell them that they can only drink your juice AFTER they finish theirs and the same with the other stuff. Whenever anyone says to leave them some, the interpretation is almost always that they are allowed to have everything except a few drops or a few crumbs. \n\nIf they don't care about the juice and drink yours, just take it along yourself to only by stuff that you can eat. After they explicitly complain about the food content is when you could go back to buying separate stuff. \n\nYou SHOULD apologize.
