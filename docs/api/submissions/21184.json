I usually don't say much but today I yelled at them.\n\nI have a renal disease which means I have dietary restrictions (for example anything with potassium or phosphorus is bad for me). I've had this problem for the past 5 years. I have 2 kids of teen age. I try my best not to let my dietary restrictions be cumbersome for the rest of the family so when I cook meals I will try my best to cook things the family likes and adjust the recipe for my restrictions. There are things that I simply cannot have or I can only have very little, like orange juice (potassium), or potato chips (potassium) or anything dairy (phosphorus). So we go grocery shopping we'll buy orange juice and another type of juice that's better for me, same with potato chips, we'll get snacks that are better for me.\n\nProblem is it seems like every time we come home with something different that has been purchased \"for dad\", my teens make a point of having this first before the other stuff. So I'll see them drink my juice in the morning instead of the orange juice we bought for them , or have my snacks when they come home from school instead of the potato chips etc. When I see them do this , I usually gently reminds them to make sure to leave me some because I cannot have the other and they usually answer \"oh, it's true, I'm sorry dad!\"\n\nI've asked them if they simply preferred having my juice in the morning so I would simply buy more instead of the orange juice, same thing with the potato chips but they always say that they prefer the orange juice and the chips over my stuff.\n\nWell, today I get up, make myself breakfast and open the fridge to grab my juice, to notice there wasn't any left but the orange juice was almost full. I confronted both teens and got mad at them for emptying my juice instead of the orange juice. My wife thinks I overreacted.

You, however, will be at serious risk if they continue to eat all of your food and only leave behind food you can't eat. They obviously like your food and, despite what they say, they seem to prefer it to the other food. Shop for what you can eat and they can deal with living with your dietary restrictions.", "Ok, this is something that comes up a lot for me. \n\nI have a pretty severe gluten intolerance and everyone else in the family can eat whatever they want. (My partner, his mom, and our two small children.)\n\nI would come home hungry [from 13H shifts]  to find my gluten-free takeout eaten, 95% of the time by my partner. Or they would order in \"for everyone\"and not get one GF item in the menu, not even a plain salad. Also, I fry A TON of chicken in gluten-free bread crumbs every week that is for everyone to enjoy, but when I have a run of shifts in a row and can't cook anything additional for myself, they don't care, they try to feed it to our picky 2yo [which means it lands in the garbage] and eat it themselves. All of it, leaving me with nothing, then have the nerve to ask me why I'm so tired and not eating. \n\nNever mind that there are ingredients to cook whatever they like, plus tons of fruit and even ice cream. Forget all the take out restaurants within less than a mile that they can order from and I can't. When they're hungry they don't care that I will not just come home hungry, but also go to sleep that way. \n\n In all fairness, it also took my MIL a long time to even understand my disorder. She would try to cook for me, but use ingredients that have gluten in them and tell me she cooked GF, (ex: soy sauce with veggies, or GF pasta with non-GF seasonings). None of it was malicious, but did lead to many flares and now I trust nothing, even in my own home, unless I make it. \n\nIt took a few flip outs and locking up my GF snacks and cooking ingredients to get them to stop. I think all they managed to learn from it was that if at any point a food item was in my possession, or it existed in our fridge without it ever being something they chose or bought they better not touch it without asking first. (Common courtesy to me, but I guess I'm crazy? )\n\nPeople who don't live your life don't understand your struggles. Teenagers especially don't know the complexities of your disease, or that it can kill you if you ignore your diet and how hard it can be to get food that is safe for you. Honestly, you can't expect them to, either. \n\nI suggest a separate mini-fridge just for your food, possibly even lock it. And, yes, flip out and be an AH as many times as it takes to drill into their heads that their actions only have consequences and suffering for you, and they better start respecting that they can't just eat your food.", "NTA. Teenagers are old enough to know that they need to leave your stuff alone.", "NTA The solution here is to simply only buy what you can eat and what's on your diet. When they complain just smile and say \" oh, that's true! Sorry kids\". They won't starve on a renal diet and you can stay on your restrictions.", "Since they \"forget\" and eat/drink your stuff first, I would just stop buying the stuff you can't eat. They seem okay to eat the same as you so let them.", "NTA\n\nI would seriously consider buying a small refrigerator and putting things in it that are only yours and placing it in your office, garage, or similar.  Basically, separate things that are safe for you from the main refrigerator.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019d get a cabinet that is separate for any snack foods that are safe for you. \n\nIf they still go looking for your food, then you stop buying the \u201cnormal\u201d stuff and just buy the food safe for you to eat.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd seriously. Stop buying the other stuff. Clearly they will eat your stuff. Screw what their preferences are. They seem to be preferring what you need.", "NTA but you have to set better boundaries. Just tell them that they can only drink your juice AFTER they finish theirs and the same with the other stuff. Whenever anyone says to leave them some, the interpretation is almost always that they are allowed to have everything except a few drops or a few crumbs. \n\nIf they don't care about the juice and drink yours, just take it along yourself to only by stuff that you can eat. After they explicitly complain about the food content is when you could go back to buying separate stuff. \n\nYou SHOULD apologize. But then set better boundaries and actually communicate with them everything you typed in the post. Nothing will change unless you communicate with them", "YTA,\n\nYou're the one who decided to have those kids in the first place.....\n\nIf you can't afford to share what's in your fridge with your kids due to a \"renal disease\", then you should not of have kids in the first place!\n\nNot to mention, what's the worst that could happen from drinking something other then orange juice whilst having a renal disease? You get a little bit of diarrhea??? So what!?!?!?\n\nWhen you have kids, you have to learn to compromise, and sacrifice your own needs; in order to put your kids first!\n\nOtherwise, you're being a BAD PARENT!\n\n(Not to mention, you're going to Reddit of all places for advice on how to parent your teens?!?!
