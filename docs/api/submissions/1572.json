She\u2019s not a toddler who will get sad if people don\u2019t get her a birthday present.\n\nSome people are just super-introverts.  Are you really going to deprive your child of his grandfather because of some weird idea in your head of how people should interact?  He\u2019s not insulting towards Maddy - he just doesn\u2019t talk to her, BECAUSE HE DOESN\u2019T TALK TO ANYONE.\n\nYou and your wife need to get over yourselves.

That\u2019s not fair to your other family members. I think you\u2019re using your child\u2019s impending arrival to force your dad to behave like the man you\u2019ve always wanted him to be.

However, from what you've said, he comes off as very unfriendly, and taciturn, and that would make a lot of people uncomfortable and feel that they hate them, especially after 6 years.  To me, his behaviour is the equivalent of when you have a family or social gathering at your home, and there's one family member who refuses to come out and socialize or at least say hi to everyone. Barring sickness, the average person would think that they're being rude.  \n\n\nBut I will say that as a parent, one needs to make the effort for their kids.

It just sounds soo fake to me.", "why are you and your wife spending a weekend with a couple who doesn\u2019t want to interact with you???  That isn\u2019t my idea of a fun time.  Your dad\u2019s primary relationship is your mom.  He isn\u2019t interested in getting to know anyone else.  That\u2019s fine.  He\u2019s an adult.  What I don\u2019t get is why would you think it is a good idea to spend a weekend away knowing that he only likes to interact with your mom???\n\nYou are married.  You chose your wife.  You made vows to put her needs before anyone else\u2019s desires.  So why did you put her needs at the bottom of your list to do this weekend with your parents??  Why are you both trying to force a relationship that he doesn\u2019t want?\n\nSeriously, you need to rethink this\u2026 you cannot force a relationship where someone doesn\u2019t want one.  And there is plenty of gray area between spending a weekend together and no contact with his grandchild\u2026\n\nYour dad doesn\u2019t hate Maddy, he just doesn\u2019t want to interact with her.

The visit may just be an hour or two.  There is no harm in that.  That\u2019s what you do to not make waves where there is no chemistry between your spouse and one of your parents.  You be a bit gracious and allow a visit.\n\nYou and your wife need to decide how much you want to interact with your family and what that looks like and how often.  It\u2019s one thing to cut someone off who is abusive.  But your dad is more like absent than abusive.

Your dad struggles with social interactions and has your mom as pretty much his sole human contact. He treats everyone the same. Not rude, not insulting, just doesn't socially interact.

Your dad has problems with social interactions from the sound of it; whether it's due to autism, social anxiety, or upbringing I couldn't say.

Your dad just isn't a people person, and you and your wife both need to get over it. She needs tougher skin. The fact he's even around her, whether he showers her with love and affection or not, says he doesn't dislike her. He treats her like every other person, Right? And your mom is right..... She's not special. The ONLY person who needs to be special to your dad is your mom... His life partner. And you said he adores her. You're being childish I'm sorry to say.", "How does a conversation between them go after this?

And if you told her what you did then shes 100% uncomfortable with knowing that he's talking to her because he literally has to talk to her. You might as well hold a gun to his head, this is sooo forced.

My FIL was similar, with the exception that I don't think he EVER spoke to me, so getting asked about a sandwich would have been huge.

(Reading your post actually made me a little jealous, but I don't think it would have changed anything if my husband taken the same stand.) So, basically, my FIL reaped what he sowed. He didn't have a close relationship with his grandkids, whereas my kids were very close to their other three grandparents (my FIL was divorced from his wife). When he died, my kids, sadly, weren't very sad, since they hardly knew the guy.", "Yta. You have lost your mind!!!!  he\u2019s respectful to her he\u2019s polite. I would be grateful for that.   You have to except people how they are. You can\u2019t force them to change because that\u2019s how you want them.   if you go nc that\u2019s pretty rough, but you do what you need to.

There really isn't that much information on the interactions here, but you haven't made it clear he's done something really bad or is intentionally trying to be malicious. Maybe he just has anxiety or something.\n\nThat's reasonable he doesn't know her birthday.\n\nBased on the information you've given, I would say that's taking it too far by saying he can't meet his grandson. Maybe you should try a nicer approach and perhaps help them get to know each other a bit better.", "YTA. You are using your future son to coerce specific behavior you desire out of another person. That\u2019s diabolical. Your son is not a pawn \u265f.", "[removed]", "NTA, you literally say he was a dad that halfassed tried with his own children.

Her kids weren\u2019t as special and important as she thought.\n\nAlso, birthday comment was weird, it would be sad if Maddy\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know her birthday.

I think it\u2019s something to try and work with him on and maybe have a conversation about it away from your mom based on her reaction when you first talked with him. Knowing he\u2019s capable doesn\u2019t mean you can force an overnight change.", "Then perhaps you should clarify how accusing someone of essentially thinking your wife an \"incubator\" isn't essentially saying they're sexist? His only crime is not being very social and not seeking to get to know her, but you frame it as if he's treating her like she isn't a person. It's as good as calling him a misogynist on the pure basis that he isn't interested in being buddy buddy.", "You stated that Maddy had expressed that your dad made her uncomfortable with his behaviour\u2014when did she express these things to you? Was it only recently or had she been bringing these things up for a while?", "> my dad ignores all of my sisters partners and no one else has an issue\n\nSo then why is your wife so special?", "I think it helps add context to how little he actually knows about her. It sounds like he couldn\u2019t even take a stab in the dark at what time of year it was. I feel like most people at least know that their in-laws birthday is in early September or whatever, even if they can\u2019t remember the exact day.", "Or they have people skills and just don\u2019t bother to use them on people they aren\u2019t trying to get something from", "Just because he doesn\u2019t have people skills doesn\u2019t make his dad less of an asshole. Is everyone just skipping the fact OP said he wasn\u2019t even a great father, and barely tried to be a father. My guess OP your just done with the coldness and this situation was confirmation.", "Exactly. And the father can chose to be nice to his DIL if he wants to maintain a relationship with his son\u2019s family.", "This and he is in a powerful role; his knowledge exceeds his clients due to his training, license, etc. He also knows his role very well. Sounds like he struggles to navigate relationships outside of work.", "If he's going to be that cold and disrespectful to his son's wife that he can't even make 5 minutes of small talk he definitely should not be allowed around the kid like I do not understand any of these comments to be honest he should show a little bit of interest in the mother of his grandchild if he really wants to meet him smh", "Why have a relationship at all then? Reciprocity is basic.", "Mom doesn\u2019t really treat Mandy well either. Your description of Maddy being the only one who gets \u201cspecial treatment\u201d is also a mischaracterization of the scenario. It\u2019s just asking for common decency to a family member. He\u2019s not asking for anything outlandish. He\u2019s just the first person in the family to stand up to his dad who treats everyone badly.\n\nDad was all shocked pikachu face at being asked to be nice. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to know maddy\u2019s birthday though. Most people don\u2019t know their extended family members birthdays without looking them up.", "It didn't seem like the dad cared. I think the mom only cared because of limited time. She can drive over to OP's house to see grandkids. But considering how his mom acted, I don't think they will respect ANY of their parenting choices. Cutting out any negative influences before they could impact their kid. The dad can grow up and act like an adult instead of a 3 yo.", "OP never mentioned anything about the wife hosting the FIL. He said his father wouldn't be allowed to meet his grandchild. Based on this guy's personality, it also doesn't sound like he will be doing too much \"cooing\".\n\nOP also says that his father greets his wife and is polite - he just doesn't engage in any small talk - with anyone.\n\nIf the father suddenly forced unnatural small talk with the wife when that's not his personality, I'm sure that would also make the wife uncomfortable.", "She doesn't.  She can ignore him just like he ignores her.  Who said otherwise?", "That\u2019s not the point, it\u2019s not about maddy being special\u2014-it\u2019s about having boundaries around how you want yourself and your partner and future child to be interacted with. Maddy deserves to be heard and respected bc she stated that she is uncomfortable with this behaviour and I can appreciate that. You and I don\u2019t have the same take on this\u2014I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the AH for having boundaries, I think he\u2019s the AH for waiting 6 years to do it", "Why should the DIL get special treatment? What makes her more special than the rest of OP\u2019s family. This is a very self centered request.", "He does want Mandy to get special treatment.  Dad treats everyone in the family with indifference and OP wants him to stop treating Maddy that way. It\u2019s hypocritical for OP to ask for Maddy to be treated better knowing that we genie else in the family will continue to be treated with indifference.", "You realize that most visits to babies are when other people come to the baby\u2019s house and meet it\u2026right? \nAnd since it\u2019s the wife\u2019s home-she would be hosting her FIL while he visited and steed in silence.", "So\u2026she\u2019s going to be post partum, and nursing a newborn and just sit in silence while her FIL sits there like some AH bump on a log? Yeah no.", "I\u2019m married with a kid and still agree. If that\u2019s the way dad is with everyone then it\u2019s not anything personal. My family is very close and talks constantly, his family calls every few weeks. But that\u2019s how they are with all of their children. I don\u2019t really see the point in withholding their grandkid from them just because they have different family dynamics than I like or am used to. It\u2019s not like this dad abusive or rude, hes just not talkative.", "Why should OP have to go to bat for everyone else in the family, in order to somehow \"justify\" advocating for his own wife?  \"Don't be rude to my spouse\" isn't self centered.  It is bare minimum, and most of Reddit would be all over OP if he said he didn't think it was a big deal.", "Not at all a weird take. The son has requirements for the father to be able to maintain a relationship with his family. His siblings are free to have whatever relationship they desire with their father.", "What special treatment? Just because other people are willing to have low standards does not that someone else has to lower their standards and \"don't treat my wife like she doesn't exist\" is a comedically low bar.", "Special treatment \u2260 basic common decency. \n\nHis dad is a jerk and he is setting a boundary. Dad can either be nice or choose to continue to be a jerk to everyone. \n\nPerhaps if someone had set a boundary with him decades earlier he wouldn\u2019t be a miserly asshole. \n\nIt\u2019s not special treatment. Although the idea that he would know Maddy\u2019s birthday is a bridge too far - most people don\u2019t know their in-laws\u2019 bdays.", "Because who he is is cold and rude. OP does not have to continue to hold onto this relationship", "Because at the end of the day its THEIR kid, the grandparents doesnt get to override the parents", "Part of being family is looking out for one another. You shouldn\u2019t want to see any of your family members be mistreated. If OP wants to neglect that family value then it\u2019s hypocritical for him push his father to be a better FIL. Practice what you preach. If OP can focus only on the family values that matter to him, so can his dad.", "It\u2019s special treatment for this family because dad doesn\u2019t treat anyone except his wife with basic common decency. Why are you having difficulty grasping that concept?", "I didn\u2019t say the grandparents get to override anything. What I SAID was I don\u2019t see the point in punishing someone simply for being introverted. \n\nThis can\u2019t possibly be the same Reddit that is constantly telling people that they shouldn\u2019t be forced to do something they\u2019re uncomfortable with, now saying it\u2019s okay to use a child as a literal pawn to force someone else to do something they\u2019re uncomfortable with?", "Because it\u2019s not special treatment to ask your family to be nice to your spouse. It\u2019s just not. \n\nJust because dad is an asshole to most people doesn\u2019t make it ok. \n\nWhy are you having difficulty grasping the concept?", "Lol, youre full of it arent you, im not wasting any more time trying to talk up a brick wall", "You\u2019re just repeating yourself at this point. Do you realize that? I\u2019m never going to agree with you no matter how many ways you rephrase the same point. Why don\u2019t we just agree to disagree?", "In other words \u201cI have no valid rebuttal\u201d", ">why don\u2019t we just agree to disagree \n\nJust as OP is doing by sticking to his boundary.  His dad refuses to not be rude, so OP gets to disagree and deny access to grandbaby.", "Haha you said butt"]}
