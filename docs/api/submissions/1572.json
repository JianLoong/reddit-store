She\u2019s not a toddler who will get sad if people don\u2019t get her a birthday present.\n\nSome people are just super-introverts.  Are you really going to deprive your child of his grandfather because of some weird idea in your head of how people should interact?  He\u2019s not insulting towards Maddy - he just doesn\u2019t talk to her, BECAUSE HE DOESN\u2019T TALK TO ANYONE.\n\nYou and your wife need to get over yourselves.

However, from what you've said, he comes off as very unfriendly, and taciturn, and that would make a lot of people uncomfortable and feel that they hate them, especially after 6 years.  To me, his behaviour is the equivalent of when you have a family or social gathering at your home, and there's one family member who refuses to come out and socialize or at least say hi to everyone. Barring sickness, the average person would think that they're being rude.  \n\n\nBut I will say that as a parent, one needs to make the effort for their kids.

It just sounds soo fake to me.", "why are you and your wife spending a weekend with a couple who doesn\u2019t want to interact with you???  That isn\u2019t my idea of a fun time.  Your dad\u2019s primary relationship is your mom.  He isn\u2019t interested in getting to know anyone else.  That\u2019s fine.  He\u2019s an adult.  What I don\u2019t get is why would you think it is a good idea to spend a weekend away knowing that he only likes to interact with your mom???\n\nYou are married.  You chose your wife.  You made vows to put her needs before anyone else\u2019s desires.  So why did you put her needs at the bottom of your list to do this weekend with your parents??  Why are you both trying to force a relationship that he doesn\u2019t want?\n\nSeriously, you need to rethink this\u2026 you cannot force a relationship where someone doesn\u2019t want one.  And there is plenty of gray area between spending a weekend together and no contact with his grandchild\u2026\n\nYour dad doesn\u2019t hate Maddy, he just doesn\u2019t want to interact with her.

The visit may just be an hour or two.  There is no harm in that.  That\u2019s what you do to not make waves where there is no chemistry between your spouse and one of your parents.  You be a bit gracious and allow a visit.\n\nYou and your wife need to decide how much you want to interact with your family and what that looks like and how often.  It\u2019s one thing to cut someone off who is abusive.  But your dad is more like absent than abusive.

Your dad struggles with social interactions and has your mom as pretty much his sole human contact. He treats everyone the same. Not rude, not insulting, just doesn't socially interact.

Your dad has problems with social interactions from the sound of it; whether it's due to autism, social anxiety, or upbringing I couldn't say.

Your dad just isn't a people person, and you and your wife both need to get over it. She needs tougher skin. The fact he's even around her, whether he showers her with love and affection or not, says he doesn't dislike her. He treats her like every other person, Right? And your mom is right..... She's not special. The ONLY person who needs to be special to your dad is your mom... His life partner. And you said he adores her. You're being childish I'm sorry to say.", "How does a conversation between them go after this?

And if you told her what you did then shes 100% uncomfortable with knowing that he's talking to her because he literally has to talk to her. You might as well hold a gun to his head, this is sooo forced.

My FIL was similar, with the exception that I don't think he EVER spoke to me, so getting asked about a sandwich would have been huge.

(Reading your post actually made me a little jealous, but I don't think it would have changed anything if my husband taken the same stand.) So, basically, my FIL reaped what he sowed. He didn't have a close relationship with his grandkids, whereas my kids were very close to their other three grandparents (my FIL was divorced from his wife). When he died, my kids, sadly, weren't very sad, since they hardly knew the guy.", "Yta. You have lost your mind!!!!  he\u2019s respectful to her he\u2019s polite. I would be grateful for that.   You have to except people how they are. You can\u2019t force them to change because that\u2019s how you want them.   if you go nc that\u2019s pretty rough, but you do what you need to.

There really isn't that much information on the interactions here, but you haven't made it clear he's done something really bad or is intentionally trying to be malicious. Maybe he just has anxiety or something.\n\nThat's reasonable he doesn't know her birthday.\n\nBased on the information you've given, I would say that's taking it too far by saying he can't meet his grandson. Maybe you should try a nicer approach and perhaps help them get to know each other a bit better.", "YTA. You are using your future son to coerce specific behavior you desire out of another person. That\u2019s diabolical. Your son is not a pawn \u265f.", "[removed]", "NTA, you literally say he was a dad that halfassed tried with his own children.

Her kids weren\u2019t as special and important as she thought.\n\nAlso, birthday comment was weird, it would be sad if Maddy\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know her birthday.

Bc he seems like the type that keeps track of his hours during \u201cpersonal\u201d time as well.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s asking for small talk though. I also hate small talk and avoid it hard. \n\nBut I find it pretty easy to extend basic social niceties like acknowledging someone\u2019s presence when they come to your home, saying good morning to someone, etc. \n\nI skip interactions when I can without being rude, but if I knew someone needed more from me and my disinterest was hurting their feelings, I\u2019d make an effort, especially if they were a close contact.\n\nDad\u2019s not failing to make small talk, he\u2019s failing to make ANY talk.\n\nMy brother is like this and it\u2019s off-putting as hell. He still lives with my mom, as does his daughter (part time) and she\u2019s turning out the same way.\n\nI once got bamboozled into driving two hours to go to her house for a birthday party for him that he was late enough to that I got suckered into staying well past when I planned to leave because he still hadn\u2019t shown up. When he finally made an appearance, it turned out that he had been in the house the whole time. He just didn\u2019t feel like coming down, and then he took a nap, and then he decided he wanted to take a shower.\n\nHe\u2019s perfectly capable of being a regular person when it suits him, he\u2019s just a dick and always has been. Given that my niece seems to be heading the same direction, I wouldn\u2019t want the kids I don\u2019t even have around him either.", "good for your brother. i dislike a few of my cousins parters and i still make it a point to make small talk when i see them because i love my cousins and i know it makes them happy that their partners feel included in the family.", "Yup, people absolutely hate receiving consequences for their actions. Not engaging with people makes them so angry", "Which is what he's doing. He's moving beyond needing an asshole in his life.", "That's literally what he's doing, but he was trying to tell his father that his actions were endangering the relationship in the hope that his father would be willing to change. He got his answer", "My mom changed to be in my life. Why shouldn\u2019t OP give it a shot? If his dad chooses not to change, it will be his loss.", "In the end it's protection for the kid. Having a grandpsrent that doesn't give a shit is worse than not having one at all.", ">You wouldn\u2019t happen to know how to make the TM (trademark) symbol would you?\n\nThe easiest way may be to paste it in.  The other way I know of is to use [HTML character codes](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/symbols/) to enter it -- but you have to be in Markdown mode to do so.  So first you'd hit the \"Markdown Mode\" option in the comment-entry box, then type the HTML code for the trademark symbol -- \\&trade; -- and when you post the comment it'll appear as the \u2122 symbol (you can use the \"Switch to Fancy Pants Editor\" option to return to the default comment mode and check it first).", "it\u2019s weird for him to think he\u2019d  be entitled to a relationship with a baby whose mother he can\u2019t be bothered to speak to without being told to.", "it's immoral to think u get to have a relationship with your grandson after essentially ignoring your daughter in law enough for her to still be a stranger", "Indeed. Like he literally has to be forced to even ask her if she wants a sandwich. That was the only contact he had with her.  A corpse puts in more effort to communicate", "I\u2019m married with kids and I agree with what they said.", "Those are rules more than boundaries per se. Boundaries are things you won\u2019t allow people to do to you. Requirements for people to do certain things for you are just rules", "Acting like she exists is special treatment now? Jesus. The bar has never been lower.", "Where did the grandparents say they wanted to all up in the wife\u2019s business postpartum? All the grandmother said is that she wants a relationship with her grandson. That could be as little as seeing him on holidays.", "Right\u2014 and so \u201cif you continue x,y,z behaviour then me/we/our child will not be interacting with you\u201d is a boundary.", "OP is upset because his father doesn\u2019t *chat*.   OP is upset that his father hasn\u2019t memorised his DIL\u2019s birthday date.\n\nThe man still offers food to his guests, he still extends basic courtesy.   He\u2019s just a quiet person.   That\u2019s different to being \u201ccold and rude\u201d.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to maintain a relationship, but cutting his dad off for the crime of not being neurotypical makes him an asshole.", "So\u2026wife is supposed to sit there and watch her MIL fawn over the baby while her FIL ignores her and says nothing on holidays? \n\nThat\u2019s sounds like a pleasant holiday. /s", "There are many neurotypical who don\u2019t conduct themselves as assholes. So he feeds his guest, call him man of the year. He actively makes others feel like a burden. Blame on it anything you want, but OP is not the asshole for asking for common decency from his father.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he extends basic courtesy", "Did you miss the first sentence that says my dad is not a warm man, he was not a great father and only made some effort with his own kids?? The father is TAH.", "Why are you acting like this woman has no agency and can\u2019t speak for herself?  No, she doesn\u2019t have to \u201csit there\u201d.  She has a cordial relationship with MIL - so they can engage in the small talk you and OP are so in love with.  FIL will probably take one look at the baby, grunt, and wander off, so that takes care of that problem.", "If it is special treatment to treat someone with basic decency, then the man is not worth being around. Why expose your child to someone who will treat him like that? To me, this is an effort to protect his child ultimately.", "Nothing described says he actively makes others feel like a burden.   He\u2019s just a quiet person.   He plays host, he does all the normal things a person should do in society.   OP is upset because he *doesn\u2019t make small talk* and *doesn\u2019t memorise important dates*.   That\u2019s insane.", "OP describes him extending basic courtesy in his post.", "He\u2019s incredibly rude. If he\u2019s going to be this rude, then he doesn\u2019t need to be in their home or around their kid. \n\nMom can have all the relationship with the grandkids OP allows-just without her rude husband who can\u2019t bother to speak to a woman staying in his house for the weekend unless his wife forced him to ask her what she wants on her sandwich.", "OP literally said his wife feels like she is unwanted in their home. His father made her feel that way. It\u2019s not up to you to say he didn\u2019t. Hell, if I was in her shoes and my FIL didn\u2019t speak to me at all, not even small talk, I\u2019d feel the same way.", "He says basic greetings - and even that not consistently. \n\n>We recently spent a weekend away with my parents and he only spoke to Maddy once and it was to ask what she wanted on her sandwich and only because my mom sent him to ask.\n\nSo on the weekend trip he didn\u2019t even exchange greetings. OP does not mention courtesy.", "OP\u2019s going to deprive his child of a relationship with their grandfather because of some perceived slight against his wife - a slight that doesn\u2019t even exist, because that\u2019s how the father is with virtually everyone who isn\u2019t his wife.  The fact that the father can talk to clients means nothing - a lot of people who have difficulty talking to people in social situations can talk to people professionally.  It\u2019s a different context.\n\nThe only person OP is punishing is his child.  I lost my only surviving grandparent at a really young age.  What a terrible parent my mom would have been if she had kept others from me."]}
