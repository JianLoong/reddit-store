She\u2019s not a toddler who will get sad if people don\u2019t get her a birthday present.\n\nSome people are just super-introverts.

However, from what you've said, he comes off as very unfriendly, and taciturn, and that would make a lot of people uncomfortable and feel that they hate them, especially after 6 years.  To me, his behaviour is the equivalent of when you have a family or social gathering at your home, and there's one family member who refuses to come out and socialize or at least say hi to everyone. Barring sickness, the average person would think that they're being rude.  \n\n\nBut I will say that as a parent, one needs to make the effort for their kids.

It just sounds soo fake to me.", "why are you and your wife spending a weekend with a couple who doesn\u2019t want to interact with you???  That isn\u2019t my idea of a fun time.  Your dad\u2019s primary relationship is your mom.  He isn\u2019t interested in getting to know anyone else.  That\u2019s fine.  He\u2019s an adult.  What I don\u2019t get is why would you think it is a good idea to spend a weekend away knowing that he only likes to interact with your mom???\n\nYou are married.  You chose your wife.  You made vows to put her needs before anyone else\u2019s desires.  So why did you put her needs at the bottom of your list to do this weekend with your parents??  Why are you both trying to force a relationship that he doesn\u2019t want?\n\nSeriously, you need to rethink this\u2026 you cannot force a relationship where someone doesn\u2019t want one.  And there is plenty of gray area between spending a weekend together and no contact with his grandchild\u2026\n\nYour dad doesn\u2019t hate Maddy, he just doesn\u2019t want to interact with her.

The visit may just be an hour or two.  There is no harm in that.  That\u2019s what you do to not make waves where there is no chemistry between your spouse and one of your parents.  You be a bit gracious and allow a visit.\n\nYou and your wife need to decide how much you want to interact with your family and what that looks like and how often.  It\u2019s one thing to cut someone off who is abusive.  But your dad is more like absent than abusive.

Your dad struggles with social interactions and has your mom as pretty much his sole human contact. He treats everyone the same. Not rude, not insulting, just doesn't socially interact.

Your dad has problems with social interactions from the sound of it; whether it's due to autism, social anxiety, or upbringing I couldn't say.

The fact he's even around her, whether he showers her with love and affection or not, says he doesn't dislike her. He treats her like every other person, Right? And your mom is right..... She's not special. The ONLY person who needs to be special to your dad is your mom... His life partner. And you said he adores her. You're being childish I'm sorry to say.", "How does a conversation between them go after this?

And if you told her what you did then shes 100% uncomfortable with knowing that he's talking to her because he literally has to talk to her. You might as well hold a gun to his head, this is sooo forced.

My FIL was similar, with the exception that I don't think he EVER spoke to me, so getting asked about a sandwich would have been huge.

(Reading your post actually made me a little jealous, but I don't think it would have changed anything if my husband taken the same stand.) So, basically, my FIL reaped what he sowed. He didn't have a close relationship with his grandkids, whereas my kids were very close to their other three grandparents (my FIL was divorced from his wife). When he died, my kids, sadly, weren't very sad, since they hardly knew the guy.", "Yta. You have lost your mind!!!!  he\u2019s respectful to her he\u2019s polite. I would be grateful for that.

There really isn't that much information on the interactions here, but you haven't made it clear he's done something really bad or is intentionally trying to be malicious. Maybe he just has anxiety or something.\n\nThat's reasonable he doesn't know her birthday.\n\nBased on the information you've given, I would say that's taking it too far by saying he can't meet his grandson. Maybe you should try a nicer approach and perhaps help them get to know each other a bit better.", "YTA. You are using your future son to coerce specific behavior you desire out of another person. That\u2019s diabolical. Your son is not a pawn \u265f.", "[removed]", "NTA, you literally say he was a dad that halfassed tried with his own children.

Probably not the best idea to cut them out grandkid\u2019s life.\n\nETA sorry YTA here", "That's fucking weird\n\nSo do u even go to any gatherings with your immediate family?\n\nDo u just ignore them the whole time?\n\nI'm not talking about a distant cousin, this his his daughter in law.\n\nShe isn't giving the ultimatum, she's just stating it's uncomfortable and her husband agrees to the extent he's fed up, he only put minimal effort in as a dad in case u forgot, u cool with that too?", "I'm married and I don't know all my in laws birthdays.\n\nThe kids, yes. But everyone else I just have a vague idea of around what time of the month it is.\n\nBut yeah don't assume. You can't force all relationships. I don't have much to say to my MIL apart from checking in on how things have been but have a lot of shared hobbies with FIL. Work with what you've got.", "Probably different perspective. For example with me, I would feel more comfortable if it wasn't forced. It's like those people who smile at you, but you can sense their true feelings.\n\nHe doesn't care about his son's partner though. Clearly his behaviour showed it. What's the point on faking to care when he really doesn't?", "People are saying OP is TA because his father has always been this way and OP wants him to change just for his wife. That\u2019s ridiculous. Why should OP and his wife be the only family members who get a normal relationship with OP\u2019s dad? I wouldn\u2019t blame OP is he wanted to cut ties with his dad but this ultimatum is just ridiculous.", "Reddit is weird sometimes. A few weeks back I was on a thread where I got diwnvoted hard for saying a parent shouldn't have had their son arrested over $20.", "My judgement for him being TA was simply because there were more diplomatic ways of handling it since he's never raised the matter before.\n\nThe first thing I did when introducing my now husband to my parents was let both sides know beforehand of some shared interests they had with each other so they had a starting point. \n\nIt would have been so easy to do something similar but now OP has put his wife in the awful position of knowing any future interactions with her in laws are forced because he went for the nuclear option in conversation #1.", "Pretty sure forced interaction means it's inconvenient,  not to mention uncomfortable for everyone. \n\nNo one should be forced to interact with anyone they don't want to interact with.", "You want him to make small talk, but she doesn\u2019t make small talk with him?\n\nDoes your dad make small talk with anyone else?", "One thing most people don't like is being cut off. They can cut you off from their lives but you can't cut them off from your life. I have seen best friends fight over being cut off by the other friend.", "This isn\u2019t a hook up or a short term romance, this is his wife of 6 years carrying his child.", "Exactly this. I'm going to law school so obviously not a lawyer yet, but this goes the same for anyone in work. When there's money on the table, people care. I'm super nice to people at my job because I get paid but couldn't gaf outside of my job.", ">One thing that will help is going to be your child.\n\nVery good point. Don't think OP considered that the baby is something that would have created the bond.\n\nNow he's tainted it", "The kids part is the whole problem buddy, if you dont have kids then your situation cannot be comparable, buddy.", "Eh, you can't really expect a relationship with someone's child if you act like one of their parents is a hardship to be around. \n\nIf OP doesn't have much of an emotional connection to his father I see this more as the logical conclusion of being cold to your extended family: you don't see them. \n\nI agree no point in forcing an awkward relationship though.", "It's ridiculous that everyone in the family acts like a grown man shouldn't have to even pretend to put in effort.\n\nI live in Canada and my dad barely speaks English on top of having undiagnosed neurodevelopmental issues and even he still tries\n\nIt's fucking weird, this is a grown ass adult. How did he get through life like this?!", "She tried for a while but I don't expect her to keep putting herself out there just to get rejected. He doesn't do it socially for anyone else but manages to take clients golfing and to lunch because he cares about money enough to make small talk", "Some people feel it\u2019s not worth the fight. They would rather just deal with it and keep the peace than argue about it. With people like OP\u2019s dad, you have to either take them as they are or cut ties because they\u2019re not going to change. It\u2019s sad but it\u2019s true.", "Do you really want your father to view your wife as a job?   A person he has to \u201cbuy\u201d just like his clients?\n\nWhy isn\u2019t your father enough just being who he is?"]}
