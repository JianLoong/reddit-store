I have  been in competition with her church for many year and I am tired of the rejection and hurt.

And then complaining about needing money.\n\nIf this is an adult man who is capable of living independently, she should really think about why she is making this decision. Additionally, if she is choosing to be there during his rehab and performing tasks for him, she may actually be putting his rehab back. Patients who are undergoing PT, OT, Rehab etc, are often encouraged to do as much as they can independently. In fact, patients everywhere are generally encouraged to do as much as they can independently and fully participate in their own care needs (within safe limitations). This is part of the preparation for discharge home. Medical care can often be a use-it-or-lose-it scenario when it comes to physical health. The less you do independently in hospital, the poorer your outcome is going to be at home.\n\nYour mother seems to give you many unclear answers when you question her decisions. You may need to view this as a series of choices she is making, rather than unfortunate circumstances that befall her."]}
