It is a huge responsibility taking care of a mentally disabled adult whos family is only after his money but will not assist in anyway.  My mom has always wanted to be married so this is a dream come true for her but it is coming at the price of her mental health and im not willing to risk my mental health as it is ready fragile due to recent separation from my husband of 20 yrs.  I have  been in competition with her church for many year and I am tired of the rejection and hurt.  She is constantly mistreated and taken advantage of and I get so angry that she can't see it and just let's it happen.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She could figure this stuff out with the family and the money situation, but she is choosing not to. Instead, it is easier for her (for whatever reason) to expect you to make a sacrifice.\n\nShe cannot solve this problem without taking some kind of active steps forward. That means facing some degree of conflict and stress, but she's already facing that.\n\nThere is nothing you can do if she does not want to take these steps. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink, etc, etc.\n\nAdditionally, what tasks was she performing in the hospital that were so necessary that she take multiple full days off, rather than visiting after work? Can this man care for himself at home, or does he need a full-time caregiver? I understand that it is not the nurse/doctor/aid's job to spend 24/7 caring for a patient's needs, but people are often in the hospital all on their own with severe dementia or disabilities. What is so unique about this situation that this man cannot spend 8 hours alone by himself in the hospital? How does he function at home on his own?", "You are not the ahole\nThis is not your problem, don\u2019t feel guilty\nLive your life!!"]}
