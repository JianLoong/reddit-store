For almost 5 years. A year and a half ago, my friend, Maverick (25M) got engaged to his fianc\u00e9e Brittany (25F).\n\nI have been friends with Maverick for over 10 years. Maverick and I went to high school together and our families and us were very close. Maverick is in the military now and we don\u2019t talk as much, but I still consider him a good friend.\n\nWhen Kelly and I started dating, Maverick was dating a girl named Ashley (24F). Kelly and Ashley became very close. Maverick broke up with Ashley 2 years later and Kelly was sad she wouldn\u2019t be seeing Ashley regularly, but still wanted to be friends. \n\nVery shortly (a few days) after Maverick broke up with Ashley, he started hooking up and then started dating Ashley\u2019s roommate at the time. Kelly found out and called Ashley, and Ashley was crushed. \n\nA month after they started dating, Maverick had us meet Brittany. Kelly was upset that this was Ashley\u2019s roommate and she FaceTimed Ashley when she was around Brittany to make her feel bad.  After this, Kelly was very upset with Maverick and sent him a series of messages saying she lost respect for him and some mean things about Brittany. I think Kelly  went too far and wasn\u2019t happy that she got involved. Kelly did end up apologizing to Maverick.\n\nSince these incidents 3 years ago, we have not seen Brittany again. We have heard from others that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees, and she has refused to see us every time they have been in town. Maverick doesn\u2019t live in town anymore so I don\u2019t see him all the time, but we have hung out 1-3 times a year when he visits our city. Kelly has seen him once since this incident and was civil and friendly to Maverick.\n\nMaverick and Brittany announced that they are getting married about 6 months ago. I found out that their wedding is the same day as Kelly\u2019s birthday. Kelly has been nervous for months that she wouldn\u2019t be invited, but I assured her that Maverick wouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nI got a save the date about 6 weeks ago. It was only addressed to me, but I didn\u2019t think that was weird. I texted Maverick and asked if I had a date, but he didn\u2019t reply. I used their wedding website to RSVP about a week ago, and I was able to enter Kelly\u2019s name as well. Yesterday, Maverick texted me and said that he does not want Kelly at their wedding. He said that based on what happened with the girls that he and Brittany are not comfortable with Kelly being there.\n\nKelly is crushed. She wants to be with me on her birthday and has a tough relationship with her birthday. Additionally, we got into a very big fight 2 years ago because I went to a family wedding without her.

Kelly sounds like she kinda bullied the bride which is understandable why they don\u2019t want her there but I see she was trying to protect her friend who\u2019s roommate slept with her bf., she just took it too far. You said you don\u2019t really have a relationship with him anymore, what joy could you bring them on their day?", "Your girlfriend FaceTime your buddies ex while meeting his now fiance? And you're surprised the relationship went down hill?\n\nNAH for this specific choice, go or don't if you're ok completely ending your friendship with Maverick. But your girlfriend sounds not great in general.", "I mean, NTA on the question and because these people aren\u2019t even close friends of yours anymore. But wow your girlfriend is a piece of work. The idea that she would EVER be invited is absolutely ludicrous. She single-handedly destroyed this friendship for you. And it sounds like an absolutely fantasy that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees. Sounds like an excuse you have built to explain why they cut Kelly out. This is likely Maverick\u2019s last attempt to reach out to you to rebuild your friendship so when you choose your girlfriend that\u2019s probably the absolutely end of the road for this friendship, but it sounds like you are fine with what an asshole your girlfriend is, so that\u2019s that.", "Your girlfriend bullied and antagonised Brittany and you expect them to want her at their wedding? \n\nAlso, it's pretty funny you say your friend's girlfriend is controlling and then say you got into a fight with your own girlfriend because you went to a wedding without her, and she also managed to ruin one of your friendships because of her own petty attitude. It seems like the only controlling and rude person here is your girlfriend.

There is nothing about her doing something wrong. \n\nYou may decide not to go because of loyalty or feeling guilty, but be honest - this is on Kelly, not on your friend and his fiancee.", "YTA, but not for not going. For not seeing what your girlfriend did to your friend's girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend did everything in her power to make the bride upset, deliberately and in her face and you're suprised she doesn't get invited? Really?", "Your girlfriend is learning that actions have repercussions.   If I was the bride I wouldn't invite her either.\n\nYou reap what you sow.\n\nAre you going?", "YTA. Your girlfriend behaved immaturely and your friend and his fiancee are justified in not wanting her there after the way they were treated. You've been friends for a long time with this guy and missing his wedding because your girlfriend wasn't invited (justifiably) seems wrong. You can celebrate her birthday with her any day, it doesn't sound as if there were specific plans. If she has matured at all since the incident, she will understand.", "Lol two threads same topic totally different responses\u2026this is a good experiment.", "YTA. Why would you think anyone would want Kelly at this wedding? She sounds horrible, I am surprised you got an invite.", "I\u2019ll be the unpopular opinion and say NTA. Maverick seems like *** for starting dating his ex\u2019s roommate and then both of them hiding it from her. Kelly was a good friend to Ashley and i would like to know if my ex suddenly started dating my roommate so soon after breaking up and both were hiding it from me. \nHowever, Kelly should\u2019ve apologised to Brittany too. Being on bad terms with the bride would definitely not earn you an invite. But if she stood by her friend, why does she want to go to this wedding? Friends choose sides after a breakup, and it seems like Kelly chose Ashley, so why does she wanna go to Maverick\u2019s wedding? \nIt\u2019s just bad luck that the wedding\u2019s on her birthday, but maybe you can split the day, half and half, if you wanna salvage your friendship with Maverick. Wouldn\u2019t suggest leaving your girlfriend alone on her birthday. \nThough Kelly really needs to understand she burnt that bridge, and she needs to accept it.", "I don't blame Kelly for being weirded out that after 2 years of double dates with Ashley, a month later Maverick was bringing someone else to the double-dates. But would you tolerate someone treating Kelly the way Kelly treated Brittany? Would you invite that person to your wedding? Kelly was right to assume Maverick wouldn't want her at his wedding. She took her disapproval way too far and burned a bridge.\n\nYou wouldn't be the AH if you didn't attend the wedding to support your gf the way Maverick supports his wife. Make a decision you can live with. Not attending Mavericks weddings will affect your friendship with him. Attending a wedding without Kelly (*again*) will affect your relationship with Kelly. NTA", "[removed]", "ESH. This one\u2019s kind of complicated. Maverick (most likely) cheated on Kelly\u2019s good friend with the friend\u2019s roommate. I think it would be hard for most people to be completely cordial in that situation, if they felt a strong sense of loyalty to their friend. Did she go too far? It sounds like it. So I don\u2019t blame Brittany or Maverick for not wanting to be around her. Even though they were definitely the AHs to Ashley, Kelly sounds like she was an AH to them. \n\nHonestly, I think your friendship with Maverick is over, especially if you plan to spend the rest of your life with Kelly. If you went to this wedding without her, you would definitely be putting your relationship in jeopardy. And there\u2019s no guarantee you would even sustain a friendship with Maverick, considering he never made the effort to see you any time he was in town.

You are not an asshole for not going, but he is not an asshole for not wanting your girlfriend there. She was immature and a bully, and guess what? And now she has consequences.\n\nI think it's very telling that your girlfriend apologized to *Maverick* instead of the girl she humiliated. \n\n>We have heard from others that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees, and she has refused to see us every time they have been in town.\n\nYou have no proof she is controlling, but that's not why she refused to see you both when they are in town.

The relationship between Maverick and Ashely may have been okay but something was missed and Maverick realised this when he met Brittany so broke up with Ashley because he knew it wouldn't last and they'd all be wasting their time.  It's unfortunate that it was Ashley's roommate but it doesn't mean that they weren't meant for each other.  You don't say how long Brittany was Ashley's roommate before the break up, just that Ashley and Maverick broke up after 2 years.  However it seems odd that Ashley didn't know that him and Brittany were together until Kelly told her.  It's possible that Maverick didn't meet Brittany as Ashley's roommate but met elsewhere.  It's not something that would be able to be hidden for long though.\n\nIf he cheated then that's a different story.  But at this point I feel like I need to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nKelly's behaviour towards Brittany was pretty bad.  I'm glad that you weren't impressed with it.  It was childish.  Perhaps if he cheated then there's more justification but not really.  Kelly wasn't that young when this occurred but she was acting like an immature 15 year old.\n\nI cannot blame Brittany for not wanting to have anything to do with Kelly and I'm not sure I would be inviting her to my wedding either.  Unfortunately Kelly's behaviour towards Brittany has impacted your relationship with Maverick and you're about to put the final nail in the coffin of your relationship.\n\nYour relationship with Maverick is never going to be the same if you guys stay with your partners.  You should be able to maintain a relationship where you catch up with just the two of you or with your bloke mates.  But you're even going to struggle to go to Maverick's house because Brittany might be there and Kelly won't like it and Maverick won't be able to come to yours because Kelly won't like him coming there or Brittany won't like him going there.\n\nYou've been with Kelly for 5 years.  Is she your one and only?  Do you plan to have kids together or are you seeing some red flags that are telling you that this relationship may not last the distance.\n\nKelly's response to you going to a family wedding without her was an over reaction.  There was no need for a fight.  Has she grown up since then as it was 2 years ago.\n\nKelly will have plenty more birthdays and there's nothing stopping the two of you from celebrating a day or two earlier or later.  I doubt that they picked this date because it was Kelly's birthday as they don't care for her and they wouldn't even know when it is.  It was likely a co-incidence. I don't think Brittany cares that much about Kelly.  \n\nWhether or not she's controlling or not is hard to tell.  She might just have strong boundaries and may forgive but doesn't forget and may just be calling out bad behaviour.  Perhaps the friends that are telling you she's controlling have done or said some questionable things to Brittany (especially if they are good friends of Kelly's) and Brittany has set a boundary and left it up to Maverick as to what he does and he's realised that the behaviour wasn't great and Brittany was right... so to save face, the friends are saying it's Brittany that's stopping them from seeing Maverick when it's really them.  Brittany is not stopping you catching up with Maverick.  Do you have a good time when you catch up?  Do you still feel fairly close to him?\n\nKelly might be crushed she wasn't invited but that is the consequence of how she treated Brittany in the beginning.  It's something that she will have to deal with as Brittany has drawn her line in the sand and there is little she can do at this point about it.  Did Kelly apologise to Brittany at any point or was it just to Maverick.  Because if she hasn't, then that is more reason for Brittany to request that she not be there.\n\nIf Maverick is any sort of friend to you, then I would suggest that you go to the wedding.  It's one day.  You and Kelly are allowed to do things separately.  And unless Kelly has grown up in these last 3 years then you've actually got bigger issues and Brittany may not be the problem.  There is no need for her to over react or make your life miserable if you do choose to go.", "ESH\n\nYour girlfriend sucks for antagonizing groom and insulting the bride in a classless, aggressive manner. No matter the emotions running at the time, putting yourself in the centre of an undefined drama wasn't a good move and tbh, they have every right not to invite her.\n\nMaverick sucks for potentially cheating on Ashley.\n\nBrittany sucks for isolating her boyfriend.\n\nAnd YOU suck for defending Maverick's actions, trying to force an invite for your girlfriend.\n\nI have no idea why you would think Kelly would be invited. Tbh the pair of you sound like you've just drifted apart. Just let this friend go and go celebrate with Kelly.", "No", "Your girlfriend can't insult people (even if it's deserved) and still wait for the invitation to those people's wedding. Under no circumstances do I think Brittany is the reason why you and Maverick are no longer close, the reason is your girlfriend and her need to get involved in other people's issues and her inability to set limits.\n\n Telling Ashley that they were together is fine, but to FaceTime with her every time they met with Brittany and Maverick? It's a great no, your girlfriend should stop getting so involved in other people's lives.", "YTA your girlfriend is a shit stirrer. She was horrible to them both, and you expect them to bend over and invite her?! Are you out of your mind?!!!  YTA", "While your GFs behaviour was inappropriate, Maverick and Brittany definitely shouldn't have paraded their relationship so fast - that put your GF in a very uncomfortable position.\n\nBoth suck, but Maverick sucks more for not inviting her. It's been many years and they were both in the wrong, it's sad he couldn't take the high ground now.\n\nThat said, they probably just don't want to be reminded about the dodgy start to the relationship on their wedding day...", "Just on the issue at hand, NTA. First, Kelly is your gf for over 5 years, so serious relationship. Second, she has issues related to her birthday and for that, you should be with her as this wedding conflicts with that. Last, while you have *known* Maverick for 10 years, you really haven't had much contact in the last 3 years and it appears that Brittany has (regardless of reasons) kept you all apart which isn't going to change, especially as long as you are with Kelly. So stay with Kelly, tell Maverick you wish him the best and you will get together with him when he can find time for you.", "OP also did not mention Kelly ever apologizing to Brittney. I definitely don't think she deserves to be invited if the bride is still uncomfortable with her...", "Close friends or roommates?

It's naive to think he and Brittany didn't start their relationship with cheating, and it's disingenuous to call Kelly's behaviour bullying or \"going after\" someone (though I will be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if OP was underplaying his gf's behaviour, but just based on the post), though she was clearly not coping well with the situation. I hope she realises how unhealthy that was.
