For almost 5 years. A year and a half ago, my friend, Maverick (25M) got engaged to his fianc\u00e9e Brittany (25F).\n\nI have been friends with Maverick for over 10 years. Maverick and I went to high school together and our families and us were very close. Maverick is in the military now and we don\u2019t talk as much, but I still consider him a good friend.\n\nWhen Kelly and I started dating, Maverick was dating a girl named Ashley (24F). Kelly and Ashley became very close. Maverick broke up with Ashley 2 years later and Kelly was sad she wouldn\u2019t be seeing Ashley regularly, but still wanted to be friends. \n\nVery shortly (a few days) after Maverick broke up with Ashley, he started hooking up and then started dating Ashley\u2019s roommate at the time. Kelly found out and called Ashley, and Ashley was crushed. \n\nA month after they started dating, Maverick had us meet Brittany. Kelly was upset that this was Ashley\u2019s roommate and she FaceTimed Ashley when she was around Brittany to make her feel bad.  After this, Kelly was very upset with Maverick and sent him a series of messages saying she lost respect for him and some mean things about Brittany. I think Kelly  went too far and wasn\u2019t happy that she got involved. Kelly did end up apologizing to Maverick.\n\nSince these incidents 3 years ago, we have not seen Brittany again. We have heard from others that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees, and she has refused to see us every time they have been in town. Maverick doesn\u2019t live in town anymore so I don\u2019t see him all the time, but we have hung out 1-3 times a year when he visits our city. Kelly has seen him once since this incident and was civil and friendly to Maverick.\n\nMaverick and Brittany announced that they are getting married about 6 months ago. I found out that their wedding is the same day as Kelly\u2019s birthday. Kelly has been nervous for months that she wouldn\u2019t be invited, but I assured her that Maverick wouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nI got a save the date about 6 weeks ago. It was only addressed to me, but I didn\u2019t think that was weird. I texted Maverick and asked if I had a date, but he didn\u2019t reply. I used their wedding website to RSVP about a week ago, and I was able to enter Kelly\u2019s name as well. Yesterday, Maverick texted me and said that he does not want Kelly at their wedding. He said that based on what happened with the girls that he and Brittany are not comfortable with Kelly being there.\n\nKelly is crushed. She wants to be with me on her birthday and has a tough relationship with her birthday. Additionally, we got into a very big fight 2 years ago because I went to a family wedding without her.

Kelly sounds like she kinda bullied the bride which is understandable why they don\u2019t want her there but I see she was trying to protect her friend who\u2019s roommate slept with her bf., she just took it too far. You said you don\u2019t really have a relationship with him anymore, what joy could you bring them on their day?", "Your girlfriend FaceTime your buddies ex while meeting his now fiance? And you're surprised the relationship went down hill?\n\nNAH for this specific choice, go or don't if you're ok completely ending your friendship with Maverick. But your girlfriend sounds not great in general.", "I mean, NTA on the question and because these people aren\u2019t even close friends of yours anymore. But wow your girlfriend is a piece of work. The idea that she would EVER be invited is absolutely ludicrous. She single-handedly destroyed this friendship for you. And it sounds like an absolutely fantasy that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees. Sounds like an excuse you have built to explain why they cut Kelly out. This is likely Maverick\u2019s last attempt to reach out to you to rebuild your friendship so when you choose your girlfriend that\u2019s probably the absolutely end of the road for this friendship, but it sounds like you are fine with what an asshole your girlfriend is, so that\u2019s that.", "Your girlfriend bullied and antagonised Brittany and you expect them to want her at their wedding? \n\nAlso, it's pretty funny you say your friend's girlfriend is controlling and then say you got into a fight with your own girlfriend because you went to a wedding without her, and she also managed to ruin one of your friendships because of her own petty attitude. It seems like the only controlling and rude person here is your girlfriend. YTA.", ">Kelly was upset that this was Ashley\u2019s roommate and she FaceTimed Ashley when she was around Brittany to make her feel bad. After this, Kelly was very upset with Maverick and sent him a series of messages saying she lost respect for him and some mean things about Brittany. I think Brittany went too far and wasn\u2019t happy that she got involved. Brittany did end up apologizing to Maverick.\n\nWhy \"Brittany went too far\"? There is nothing about her doing something wrong. \n\nYou may decide not to go because of loyalty or feeling guilty, but be honest - this is on Kelly, not on your friend and his fiancee.", "YTA, but not for not going. For not seeing what your girlfriend did to your friend's girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend did everything in her power to make the bride upset, deliberately and in her face and you're suprised she doesn't get invited? Really?", "Your girlfriend is learning that actions have repercussions.   If I was the bride I wouldn't invite her either.\n\nYou reap what you sow.\n\nAre you going?", "YTA. Your girlfriend behaved immaturely and your friend and his fiancee are justified in not wanting her there after the way they were treated. You've been friends for a long time with this guy and missing his wedding because your girlfriend wasn't invited (justifiably) seems wrong. You can celebrate her birthday with her any day, it doesn't sound as if there were specific plans. If she has matured at all since the incident, she will understand.", "Lol two threads same topic totally different responses\u2026this is a good experiment.", "YTA. Why would you think anyone would want Kelly at this wedding? She sounds horrible, I am surprised you got an invite.", "I\u2019ll be the unpopular opinion and say NTA. Maverick seems like *** for starting dating his ex\u2019s roommate and then both of them hiding it from her. Kelly was a good friend to Ashley and i would like to know if my ex suddenly started dating my roommate so soon after breaking up and both were hiding it from me. \nHowever, Kelly should\u2019ve apologised to Brittany too. Being on bad terms with the bride would definitely not earn you an invite. But if she stood by her friend, why does she want to go to this wedding? Friends choose sides after a breakup, and it seems like Kelly chose Ashley, so why does she wanna go to Maverick\u2019s wedding? \nIt\u2019s just bad luck that the wedding\u2019s on her birthday, but maybe you can split the day, half and half, if you wanna salvage your friendship with Maverick. Wouldn\u2019t suggest leaving your girlfriend alone on her birthday. \nThough Kelly really needs to understand she burnt that bridge, and she needs to accept it.", "I don't blame Kelly for being weirded out that after 2 years of double dates with Ashley, a month later Maverick was bringing someone else to the double-dates. But would you tolerate someone treating Kelly the way Kelly treated Brittany? Would you invite that person to your wedding? Kelly was right to assume Maverick wouldn't want her at his wedding. She took her disapproval way too far and burned a bridge.\n\nYou wouldn't be the AH if you didn't attend the wedding to support your gf the way Maverick supports his wife. Make a decision you can live with. Not attending Mavericks weddings will affect your friendship with him. Attending a wedding without Kelly (*again*) will affect your relationship with Kelly. NTA", "  \n\nKelly was a $unt to the bride.  That's unexcuseable. There was absolutely no reason for it.  She stuck her nose into business that wasn't hers for absolutely no reason.  So not being invited to the wedding is the consequences.   \n\nA wedding is not all day. So you can be with your girlfriend on her birthday.  She's 25.  She's not 6. She will not die if you celebrate her birthday on another day. \n\nBut it sounds like this friendship was over 3 years ago.  So, really, no point in going anyway.", "ESH. This one\u2019s kind of complicated. Maverick (most likely) cheated on Kelly\u2019s good friend with the friend\u2019s roommate. I think it would be hard for most people to be completely cordial in that situation, if they felt a strong sense of loyalty to their friend. Did she go too far? It sounds like it. So I don\u2019t blame Brittany or Maverick for not wanting to be around her. Even though they were definitely the AHs to Ashley, Kelly sounds like she was an AH to them. \n\nHonestly, I think your friendship with Maverick is over, especially if you plan to spend the rest of your life with Kelly. If you went to this wedding without her, you would definitely be putting your relationship in jeopardy. And there\u2019s no guarantee you would even sustain a friendship with Maverick, considering he never made the effort to see you any time he was in town. People grow apart, and it seems like that\u2019s where you\u2019re both at.", "YTA.\n\nWhat happened between your friend and his ex was none of Kelly's business. She made it her business and was seemingly  hostile with Brittany. \n\nAgain you haven't  been in your friends life for 3 years and none of you have tried to know Brittany  anyway.\n\nYour girlfriend  is not entitled  to an invite but you are also not entitled  to attend if you don't  want to.", "Yta. What childish peole your gf and you are. I wouldn't want her at my wedding if she had pulled that around me. You because you can't go anywhere without you gf.  You both sound exhausting to be around.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't go to the wedding, priorize your gf.", "NTA\nYou can skip any weddings you like. \n\nThe rest of this is junior high drama. What is wrong with all you people?\n\nWhy do you spend your lives wrapped up in pointless drama?", "NTA don\u2019t go and spend the day with your girlfriend", "NAH. You are not an asshole for not going, but he is not an asshole for not wanting your girlfriend there. She was immature and a bully, and guess what? And now she has consequences.\n\nI think it's very telling that your girlfriend apologized to *Maverick* instead of the girl she humiliated. \n\n>We have heard from others that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees, and she has refused to see us every time they have been in town.\n\nYou have no proof she is controlling, but that's not why she refused to see you both when they are in town. It's because she doesn't want a relationship with your girlfriend and that is valid.", "NTA - sounds like your friendship with maverick has run its course.", "NTA an invitation is not a summons.  You don\u2019t want to go without your girlfriend and they don\u2019t want her there.  It\u2019s that simple.  Send a nice gift.", "I would go to my friend\u2019s wedding, your girlfriend made this what it is no one else. People break up, it\u2019s not uncommon that they end up with someone close by as they are comfortable with this person already. \n\nHonestly, even if he had been cheating on his gf with said roommate it does not give your girlfriend the right to be a complete AH.\n\n\nIf you cherish your friend at all, go to the wedding\u2026 birthdays are every year and maybe Kelly? Will get the memo it\u2019s time to grow up. I would also make sure you explain exactly why too..\n\nWell, he\u2019s been my friend since such and such. Unfortunately but rightfully so they do not want someone at their wedding that did everything they could to make the bride uncomfortable even in the past\u2026  \n\nWhich that\u2019s another thing, did she even apologize to HER? Or is it just to your friend?

I\u2019m not even sure why OP even posted on here. Where is the interpersonal conflict? His girlfriend is not invited (for a valid reason), but if he\u2019s conflicted he can just not attend.

She\u2019s such a good friend that she\u2019s desperate to attend their wedding and can\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t want her there lmfao", "Why would she be invited when she\u2019s been nothing but rude to the bride and groom about their relationship?", "So why didn\u2019t you push to have your girlfriend go with you to your family wedding? Having her as a plus one doesn\u2019t mean she gets to be in the pictures etc. I don\u2019t understand how you wouldn\u2019t want your girlfriend with you?\n\nAs far as the story goes I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going on, but your girlfriend should be with you on her birthday If I\u2019m reading this correctly you\u2019re going to go to the wedding without her again. This is a friend not a family and not a very good one either. You should decline and spend the day with your girlfriend. If you can\u2019t do that then I don\u2019t see a future for the two of you.

Kelly did everything she could to stir up drama. Apologies don\u2019t erase the past. No one is obligated to accept an apology, and when they do, they are not obligated to allow you back as things were or you would like them to be.", "YOU were the AH to allow this.", "Why would Kelly expect to be invited after treating Brittany like this? None of you really sound like you are close anymore anyway.", "Did your GF ever even try to apologize to Brittney? At all? Or was it just your friend who got an apology? After calling Brittney horrible things, did she ever once do anything to tell or show Brittney that she was sorry? I'm guessing no, because she isn't actually sorry about it.", "That doesn\u2019t really affect the main message of the commenter.", "\nThis is the years of social media, there is ways to get information on just about everyone. You directly have her fianc\u00e9s contacts, did she ever ask you to say \u201chey, Kelly wants to apologize could we meet up next time you\u2019re in town?\u201d \n\n\nShe should have never apologized to your friend without his fianc\u00e9 who she actually wronged included\u2026 it seems like she never intended to or else she would have figured out a way. \n\nHere\u2019s an example, my fianc\u00e9 in the past made some bad decisions.. his best friend cut him off, when he got his shit together for over a year he then asked me (who has continued to be friends even after us splitting like 5 years ago) if I would speak to said friend to see if he\u2019d give him an opportunity to talk. \n\nAnd this man blocked him on EVERYTHING! It\u2019s been like 3 years now and these two idiots are best friends once again.", "It\u2019s only a birthday. Does it have a 0 on the end? If not, you can celebrate either side of it. The only one who sounds controlling here is your GF trying to make you not go to the wedding.\n\nShe can\u2019t be in the slightest bit surprised she\u2019s not invited to this woman\u2019s wedding.

She def is for her making a drama out of it.  The ex-gf would have found out eventually and it wouldn't have been on the OP and his GF if she kept her mouth shut.", "Eh Brittany doesn\u2019t sound great either if she\u2019s controlling who maverick sees", "I don\u2019t know for a fact, but he was pretty close with various people before he started dating Brittany and now he barely sees them or keeps in touch", "Idk Kelly and Ashley were friends or became friends through their boyfriends. I personally am a very loyal and supportive friend and if my friend got cheated on and their SO started bringing around their roommate (someone their close to) I wouldn\u2019t be apt to kindness. Brittany has shown that she\u2019s a sneaky individual and will stab others in the back, I wouldn\u2019t want to be her friend nor be around her knowing what she did to a friend. Maverick is at fault too of course but Brittany was Ashley\u2019s friend/roommate. It takes a certain breed to do something like that. I understand why they wouldn\u2019t want her at the wedding but OP if you want to marry this woman you have to have her back. It sounds like you and Maverick have drifted quite a bit if after 3 years you\u2019re just realizing the wound is still fresh for Brittany.", "It doesn't, but it's not a stretch. Started dating the ex-gf's roommate days after the breakup? Sure it could have been above board, but the timing makes it very, very suspicious.", "Other significant others were invited to that wedding so I get why she was upset", "The reality is they broke up.", "Possibly, but roommates do not necessarily mean they were friends.\n\nAnd the heart wants what the heart wants. \n\nPerhaps there was an attraction between Maverick and the roommate. \n\nSo Maverick did the honorable thing and broke up with the GF before dating the roommate. \n\nWhat was he supposed to do?\n\nWas Maverick supposed to keep dating the GF when he was attracted to Brittany?\n\nWas Maverick supposed to break up with the GF but not date Brittany to whom he was attracted?\n\nWas Maverick supposed to not date Brittany, who could be the love of his life,  his soulmate, because GFs feelings would be hurt?\n\nWhat was he supposed to do?\n\nKelly, on the other hand,  was a shit stirrer who was looking to cause trouble. \n\nAnd she did. \n\nShe did not deserve an invitation\n\n\nOP should have attended without Kelly.", "Who is making drama? OPs girlfriend was. \n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise why someone who bully\u2019s the bride isn\u2019t invited to the wedding.

She never apologized to her for bullying her as well.", "Is she even doing that or is op saying that because his friend spends less time with him and his bully girlfriend? Seems like the only person Brittany has an issue with is the person who was rude to her for no reason.", "Yeah I think people missed the part where Brittany hooked up with her roommate\u2019s boyfriend. Brittany sounds pretty awful.", "So you're just assuming things in bad faith of your friend's girlfriend. Seems like your girlfriend isn't the only rude person in this relationship. You do know that friendships end and it's possible that he's just no longer close to \"various people\" for different reasons than his girlfriend being controlling? You're actively assuming that Brittany is controlling and yet have no actual proof or reason to believe that, are you even actual friends with this guy? I feel sorry for him and fully understand why you two are no longer close.", "\"Very shortly (a few days) after Maverick broke up with Ashley, he started hooking up and then started dating Ashley\u2019s roommate at the time.\"\n\nYep, shit went down, at least emotionally.", "Well technically it says a few days after he started hooking up with and then dating his ex gfs roommate", "Not invited to two weddings, makes you wonder why.", "Judging by a brief look at her personality I wouldn't want her around either, especially on a day I was supposed to be happy. She seems to have a thing for drama.", "Other SOs didn\u2019t bully the bride and your girlfriend never even apologized to the bride", "Did the other dates bully the bride? Who WOULD want your gf at their wedding?", "Who is making drama? OPs girlfriend was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's what I said, twice now.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo rephrase my previous post:  She (OP's girl) was just making it happen faster than it would have naturally.  The two girls (bride and ex) were roommates and the ex would have found out.  And there would have been drama.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that was clearer.", "I mean it\u2019s possible?

Crying about not being invited to the wedding of the person you bullied is pretty comical.", "And yet she was actively excluded from both. The only common denominator here is your girlfriend.", "So I don\u2019t understand why you would go to the \u201cfriends\u201d wedding and not be with your girlfriend on her birthday! I don\u2019t understand that if they don\u2019t want anything to do with the girlfriend then it\u2019s your choice to go or not go alone. However since this is the second time she\u2019s been excluded what would be the reason? Does your family hate her too?", "If she is your SO that you plan on creating a life with then you need to stand by her and decline. If this drama happened 3 years ago and you discussed with her she went to far, and she apologized than that\u2019s that. When you make a commitment to a partner that means your a package deal. Yes her actions strained your friendship but Maverick also sounds like his fianc\u00e9 is also participating in you and maverick strained friendship. From what you describe sounds like he is ok with that and sticking by his partner.  Sometimes friendships just run their course, doesn\u2019t even sound like they guy lives by you to where you actively hangout anyways.", "This.", "My family is very big so she got excluded from the family wedding because of space. We were told no girlfriends of cousins were going but other cousins got to bring their girlfriends which was why she was upset", "Bingo you have your answer. They excluded her on purpose. This is an excuse that people use especially family for not inviting an SO to a wedding. Not enough space how much space does one person take up? I think you did a disservice to your girlfriend. if you plan on being with her for a long time by allowing her to be excluded. If you do get married I would look into excluding all of them also.", "They didn\u2019t want a drama obsessed person there, who would?", "Yes. So your family intentionally excluded her\u2026"]}
