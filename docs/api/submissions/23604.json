{"id": 23604, "submission_id": "15ewrud", "title": "AITA for telling my brother why girls don't find him attractive?", "selftext": "I (20f) and my brother (21m) currently attend university at the same school. We're pursuing similar majors so we've had a few classes together already. We meet every once in a while to talk and go over notes together. I think my brother is nice, but lately he's been getting somewhat frustrated about not getting any dates with girls.\n\nI wouldn't consider my brother ugly, but I do think there are some features he has that needs adjusting if he wants to be more attractive. The other day he asked me how he can be more attractive to women and go on dates or get a girlfriend. I wouldn't call myself a relationship master or anything but I've been in 2 relationships which is 2 more than he's ever had.\n\nI didn't want to beat around the bush or say that he just needs more confidence or anything because I believe that gives people false hope sometimes. Confident does go a long way, but personality and looks go just as far.\n\nI started with saying that his appearance isn't all that well kept. His hair is often greasy, he face is covered with acne, and I don't believe his haircut suited his face. I suggested maybe looking into growing out his hair more and learning how to style it. I offered to help with skincare because I know at least where to start regarding skin type. I also offered to help him shop for better shampoo and said he should get used to washing it more often. I also offered to help him shop for different clothes that look better than oversized jean shorts and a plain t-shirt.\n\nThen I moved onto his personality. My brother is kinda dense. For example, he asked my lesbian friend to prom multiple times even after they said they didn't like boys. He needs to understanding that when a person says no or makes an excuse (even if he thinks it's a dumb excuse) that he has to accept it. He also talks a lot about himself and can't hold a conversation well. In a date setting you want to ask questions about your date and give them room to open up maybe by asking deeper questions about their answers. He doesn't do that.\n\nI ended it by also stating that he needed better hobbies and things to talk about than his mobile games and magic the gathering. Are there many women who love gaming as well? Absolutely, but you need to have more going than talking about what new cards you got and what the latest edition is going to be. Maybe join a club or sport. Get more involved and find something more to do than school, work, and gaming. There needs to be healthy balance.\n\nIt all boils down to, it you want to attract someone, then you need to become someone that people will find attractive.\n\nWell after our meeting ended we went our separate ways. I texted him earlier today asking if we could meet up again later this week. He left me on read for a few hours before saying that he didn't want to meet up with me for a while after what I said at our last meet-up.\n\nWas I mean?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the feedback. I'd wanted to give a very small update and answer some questions. I can see how I put that all on him at once and that wasn't the right way to take it. I sent him a text outlining that I didn't mean to hurt him and I should've been kinder in what I said or at least not say it all at once. I also reworded a few things of what I said. Many people mentioned how the hobbies thing was out of place. I agree that I definitely said it the wrong way. I meant more like he only talks about the same 3 games (MtG, DnD, and whatever mobile game he's currently playing) and that trying out different things could help broaden what he also talks about with other people. I was also meaning to say that at least being open to trying out other things would help in the future when he gets with someone that he needs to be open to trying out things they enjoy doing.\n\nI finished off by stating that I'm sorry for dumping out so much and I meant it out of love. My parents got married young (19 and 21) and my brother has expressed that not finding a girlfriend after coming back from his mission like my dad did has made him confused. We grew up mormon and a big part of \"encouraging\" young men to serve a mission is that when they come back, all the young women will be fawning over him. I also said that I wasn't expecting him to make a sudden change about everything, but to take it small. I'm still open to helping him fix part of his appearance if he ever decided he wanted to make the change.\n\nSome common questions I saw. Did he actually mean a girlfriend or just hooking up? I know he meant girlfriend. I know my brother really well he is a very religious man and wants a girlfriend as he's also never had luck in high school.\n\nThe hobbies part was uncalled for. I see what you mean. I typed this out best as I worded it to him. I did mean be more open and try out more hobbies so he had more to talk about.", "created_utc": 1690848996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ewrud/aita_for_telling_my_brother_why_girls_dont_find/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Harsh maybe, but not mean. You offered constructive criticism and advice, not insults. It might take him a while to process that, though, because yeah, that's gotta sting.", "NTA.  You weren't cruel about it, you were honest.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to process.\n\nYou could have done this in phases vs. all at once, lesson learned", "I mean, you kinda blasted him with all of his failings at once.

Your brother definitely has some things to work on and I feel like you're right and he would benefit greatly. However, to basically tell him that his looks, personality, hygiene, and hobbies are what keeping him from getting a date might be accurate... but there's not really a lot else a person has to them. You basically told him, the reason you can't get a girlfriend is everything about him. He needs to do better and be better for sure, but you hit him with everything all at once. Maybe start with something and move on to the next, but you basically told him he needs to change everything. I get what you're saying, but it's hard not to have hurt feelings.", "NTA.

At a certain point it stopped being constructive and became demoralizing.\n\nAlso - some of your advice is actually detrimental: that he needs new hobbies and clubs and should play sports. You're basically telling him that he needs to become a different person. There's no sense in him faking a persona to attract women; he should focus on being the best version of himself that he can be.\n\nSomeone into nerdy things that takes care of themselves and has confidence will be more successful in relationships and life in general than someone who takes up hobbies they dislike in an attempt to find women.", "Nope, sometimes the truth can hurt, but he needed to hear it.

Even tho you weren't mean about it it sounds like his feelings (or ego) got hurt.

He also did want help. I think you went about it the wrong way. Telling him everything all at once just breaking apart everything about him including his hobby seems harsh.

Depending on how you said it, but it seems you were gentle enough, we need some tough love on occasions.", "If you did all that in one echat, you overwhelmed him.

NAH.", "You were truthful, which is the kindest thing to be in this situation. So no you were not mean, but he may feel embarrassed that you think those things about him nonetheless and be dealing with it by avoiding you.

What\u2019s he gonna do, flip his whole life around in like a week? \n\nAlso with these sorts of things it\u2019s good to point out some things he\u2019s doing that are good.

He probably thinks he is hopeless.", "as the magic the gathering playing boyfriend, you did great. if that\u2019s where he gets all of his social interaction there was no one else that was going to tell him.", "Some of the best advice I've gotten has hit hard.

Hopefully he\u2019ll get over it soon. If he continues to hold the grudge, I\u2019d say he\u2019s venturing into AH territory, but if he\u2019s just a little hurt right now, I can\u2019t say he\u2019s an AH.", "Is you brother all of my single friends?

Did you not discuss his good habits and good personality traits that he should put out there more?  Did you not discuss his other hobbies instead of bashing the ones that he currently had?\n\nI think it's a good practice to include positive things in these types of conversations and say that they're good things; \"I think it's really endearing how you're so passionate about \\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"You have great hair/features, and I think it would look even better if you did \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_,\" or some other compliment so they don't leave the conversation feeling worthless.

Is he gonna reject his girlfriend \"no\" to intimacy and harass her by keep asking. What if it escalates?\n\nYour brother sounds like a self centred narccassist. Questioning why he can't get a girlfriend when there is very obvious issues centred around him such as lack of basic hygiene, harassing a girl who isn't interested, not actually socialising. \n\nHe's antisocial, he's creepy and he believes people owe him things despite him doing nothing. Surface level this story seems like a guy who generally doesn't know why he can't get woman, but the deeper you look into this, the creepier it gets.", "You definitely had to be selfish.

We're pursuing similar majors so we've had a few classes together already. We meet every once in a while to talk and go over notes together. I think my brother is nice, but lately he's been getting somewhat frustrated about not getting any dates with girls.\n\nI wouldn't consider my brother ugly, but I do think there are some features he has that needs adjusting if he wants to be more attractive. The other day he asked me how he can be more attractive to women and go on dates or get a girlfriend. I wouldn't call myself a relationship master or anything but I've been in 2 relationships which is 2 more than he's ever had.\n\nI didn't want to beat around the bush or say that he just needs more confidence or anything because I believe that gives people false hope sometimes. Confident does go a long way, but personality and looks go just as far.\n\nI started with saying that his appearance isn't all that well kept. His hair is often greasy, he face is covered with acne, and I don't believe his haircut suited his face. I suggested maybe looking into growing out his hair more and learning how to style it. I offered to help with skincare because I know at least where to start regarding skin type. I also offered to help him shop for better shampoo and said he should get used to washing it more often. I also offered to help him shop for different clothes that look better than oversized jean shorts and a plain t-shirt.\n\nThen I moved onto his personality. My brother is kinda dense. For example, he asked my lesbian friend to prom multiple times even after they said they didn't like boys. He needs to understanding that when a person says no or makes an excuse (even if he thinks it's a dumb excuse) that he has to accept it. He also talks a lot about himself and can't hold a conversation well. In a date setting you want to ask questions about your date and give them room to open up maybe by asking deeper questions about their answers. He doesn't do that.\n\nI ended it by also stating that he needed better hobbies and things to talk about than his mobile games and magic the gathering. Are there many women who love gaming as well? Absolutely, but you need to have more going than talking about what new cards you got and what the latest edition is going to be. Maybe join a club or sport. Get more involved and find something more to do than school, work, and gaming. There needs to be healthy balance.\n\nIt all boils down to, it you want to attract someone, then you need to become someone that people will find attractive.\n\nWell after our meeting ended we went our separate ways. I texted him earlier today asking if we could meet up again later this week. He left me on read for a few hours before saying that he didn't want to meet up with me for a while after what I said at our last meet-up.\n\nWas I mean?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can fully understand why he hasn't had a relationship.", "No you more like fixed the problem I don\u2019t know why he is mad", "NTA. You laid out the cold hard truth for him. Apparently he just can't accept it. MTG is fire tho.", "To me, this seems on the surface a \u201cdon\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answer to\u201d situation.

With anyone else but your parents, your brother would wonder if there was some diplomatic fibbing in the answer he was given.", "NTA. Your advice was good and if it was presented the way you are describing, then it seems like it was given in a positive manner.  The only way I would give you a TA was if you were mean and cruel about it, but it doesn't seem as though you were.  He asked for advice that he wasn't ready to hear or to do anything about.  That's on him and not on you (and probably a lot of it hit home, so he's shooting the messenger)", "NTA. He'll get over it eventually because that was the truth that he needed to hear. Just hope he takes the advice to heart.", "NTA. Mean? Possibly? Helpful? Absolutely. Even if he disagrees with some things, just doing a few of the things you mentioned will make him massively more attractive. \n\nMaybe if anything you could have asked him if you could be honest? Maybe he expected just generic advice like being confident or even expected you to rag on girls and say they are the problem?", "I would also say maybe hes approaching the wrong girls?

Maybe it was too much at one sitting, but nothing mean.", "NTA. I often find myself wanting to give realistic advice like this. If the end of your jeans hits your ankles when you stand, it's time for new jeans.\n\nNew balances with too short jeans is not it. Things like that. I wish they would put in a fraction of the effort that women do.", "NTA. If you ask a sibling a question like that you\u2019ll get an honest answer.", "You probably gave him too much feedback all at once and he is overwhelmed.", "NTA, I wish more people would ask these questions so then they would be a little more realistic in life.", "Nta I think your advice is good and truthful", "So it kinda depends whether or not he asked you. If he was truly looking for help then NTA, but if he was venting more than asking for help I think you should have started by asking him flat out if he wants advice or not, and also considered not hitting him with everything all at once.", "He asked for your advice and you gave it. NTA\n\nTBH my brother has a lot of these same qualities, a big one being that he only talks about himself and can\u2019t take no for an answer the first time. And he\u2019s almost 40 and hasn\u2019t had a girlfriend since he was a jr in high school. It\u2019s really hard to be around someone who refuses to even try to show interest in what you are interested in", "He asked, and also presumably he's met you before. Unless this fit of honesty was wildly out of character, he should have expected it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And it pretty evident his looks were not the problem here.", "NTA sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA. Is he on the spectrum?  It definitely sounds like he is.", "Nta but you forgot to mention what you like about him.", "NTA. Don\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want to know the answer to.", "NTA for the most part, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with his hobbies. No one should take up a hobby just to be more appealing to a partner, they should do it for themselves.", "God, this hurt to read. I feel bad for him. Given what you said, it sounds like solid information he really needed. It would hurt like hell to hear, but as long as you weren\u2019t mean about how you worded it, I\u2019m going with NTA", "NTA, but that is hard feedback to hear and could take some time to process. You might have been able to use more tact in the delivery though, but I know siblings tend to be a bit more blunt.\n\nI actually did meet my wife through Magic as a hobby funny enough, but I know gender-wise it\u2019s a bit skewed, so that certainly won\u2019t work for everyone. Not impossible though!\n\nIf he wants to skew the odds in the other direction maybe he could try a dance class or something?", "NTA for trying to give constructive criticism and even offering to help him with some of the things you suggested. I will say though that not being able to find any dates may have already hurt his self esteem and you having a full list ready of ways he can improve could\u2019ve further made him feel bad. It might be a good idea to try to apologize for hurting his feelings or cheer him up. If you have any hobbies that you could ask him to join you in to see if he\u2019s interested in them that might help too, or if you have any friends/acquaintances that are into the same types of games as him maybe you could introduce them. Things like hygiene and clothing habits are easier to change but finding a new/wider social circles or new hobbies can be more difficult.", "I dont know if anyone here could truly answer this because your tone could vary wildly. The words you written here, though true and solid advice, could be delivered very nastily. \n\nIm gonna go with NTA but I think there\u2019s a al possibility that you may have been mean about it.", "NTA, when I was his age, I wish I had a sister (or anyone) who would have told me the exact same things.  I thought cargo shorts, a tee shirt, and messy hair were \"Just what guys wore\" and I was mildly repulsed by the guys who went \"over the top\" styling their hair, fussing over every angle they cut in their beard, buying 19 different colognes, etc.  But all that stuff makes a difference but **more importantly**, his obliviousness to how to even talk to women is what **will** hold him back.  The best way to get him to actually get better at it is to do it, and that is unfortunately going to cause him to go through a lot of rejection.  Additionally, he will need guidance through the rejections so show what he needed to improve on.  He could watch other guys who are better at talking to women, and see what they say and how they react, but it is really only the very basic beginning step in a 239 step process.", "NTA. This was great advice and he needed to hear it.", "NTA. You did your brother a solid. He's being really sensitive.  You should have him post a picture of himself on r/RoastMe if he thinks you were harsh.", "NTA, he needed to hear that but he really didn't want to. Eventually, he will see that you were giving him good advice, but he's hurt. He didn't expect you to say so much about changing things he could control.", "NTA.\n\nGreat advice.  Better to hear the truth and start on the path to a better tomorrow.  Your brother might be jarred and a little hurt.  Truth is hard to digest and he may be reflecting on your words.   Good job checking in on him.  Maybe next time sandwich some kind words on his good points after the critique.", "NTA - you gave him feedback on how he can better himself, take care of his appearance expand his interests. You didn\u2019t insult him but he is taking it that way bc he doesn\u2019t want to put effort into the getting a girlfriend process.", "NTA, and all your advice was good and sound (and from the tone of your post, I think delivered kindly). These are all things he really needs to work on, and it\u2019s important for him to recognize his own behavior rather than blaming women for his lack of dating. You\u2019re doing the right thing by him!\n\nHowever, this sounds like kind of an overwhelming amount of advice in one sitting, from a lot of different angles (his appearance, his affect, his hobbies). I think it would have been helpful to pick two big things to start (maybe hygiene and being more considerate of others ((listening to no, asking questions)), and then moving on to smaller concerns (clothing, how-to small talk) down the line. You\u2019re going to keep hanging out with your brother, as you guys usually do, so you can kind of keep tackling this issue one step at a time \u2014 he won\u2019t transform everything overnight!\n\nNone of that to say YTA \u2014 just that he needs time to process, and it might be helpful to call him and let him know that was a lot and apologize if he\u2019s feeling overwhelmed (again, not apologizing for doing anything wrong, just to help him not feel like everything about himself is wrong). Best of luck!", "He asked, you answered. NTA", "NAH But maybe you should have started with just the physical glow-up. Skin, hair and clothes. When he felt better about himself and if he seemed open to it, then maybe give some personality pointers. I imagine he was already in a low self esteem space and you basically told him to throw out everything about himself and become someone new. That\u2019s a hard thing to hear. Let alone pull off.", "NTA - a lot of this is solid advice and are actionable things he can do to improve the way he is perceived by others. Nothing you said boiled down to \u201cyou\u2019re ugly and will always be ugly.\u201d\n\nHowever, I do think the \u201cfind better hobbies\u201d suggestion took it a bit too far. He should want to attract people he will enjoy spending time with. Those are people who will be interested in the same things he is, or who will let him continue to do and talk about the things that interest him. He should definitely consider branching out and joining clubs as a way to meet people, but that could be joining a Magic the Gathering club.", "NTA. But damn, the truth hurts.", "NTA. That was a solid 360 review. He would do well to take your advice.", "NTA.\n\nIf he is smart, he will take the advice and work towards his insecurities ultimately benefitting himself.\n\nOften times, men lack the advice which you were giving because they don't have a girl-friend who can provide constructive criticism.\n\nIn the end, you didn't tell him these to make him feel bad but to get him dates.", "NTA. Yeah you were mean. But he asked and he needed the hear it. Take it and grow type thing", "NAH. maybe he just needs some time.", "NTA. Actually trying can be the difference maker. That said, coming from his sister it may be harder for him to accept since he either knows you won't lie to him or he assumes you're more critical than others would be (depending on your relationship with him). If anything, it sounds a little harsh. What he probably heard was something like, \"you look like dirty crap, you don't listen, and you have no personality.\" May not be wrong, but he may be a bit upset. But those kinds of changes can be the difference between \"ew\" and dating material. Maybe he can find someone with similar interests, but cleaning up can do wonders.", "NTA. Your advice was solid.

He asked you why women dont like him and you told him literally everything he does is terrible, lol.", "I'm going to go with NAH. You did exactly what he asked you to do. I can understand he got upset, he probably felt like he got totally tore down. Which isn't wrong, but it hurts sometimes.\n\nMy only suggestion is to consider his feelings next time. I think he was looking for a couple suggestions, and you basically told him everything about him needs work (how he sees it. Hell, it may even be true), and it's hard to take criticism for some people.\n\nThat's all assuming he wasn't just hoping you'd say, \"there's nothing you need to change bro, you're perfect!\" in which case, he really shouldn't have asked.", "To everyone saying NTA, yes this person is the ahole.  They picked on someone who is on the Autism Spectrum.", "Your hobbies comment was not harsh or uncalled for. Branching out your hobbies is one of the best ways to meet people. Also, the hobbies he has skew heavily male so it would be better if he could include something else.", "He\u2019s lucky to have a caring brother that can help him out and be honest.  What if a girl told this stuff?  He would be mortified", "Wow.  \ud83d\udc4f  Arguably harsh.  But needed apparently.  You are like the perfect girl.  Most guys need this.  Myself included.  You might could've been more diplomatic, but thats you getting better.  \n\nHe's digesting what you said.  Give him a minute.  Approach him later from a \"I'm here to help\" and see how it goes.  He's gotta step up too.  He's made the first step.  \n\nI'm feeling good about this.  A thank you from guys everywhere.  \ud83d\udc66", "There's several factors involved.  There's the veracity of what you said...which is most likely true.  That said...perhaps the style of the delivery is what was lacking.  There's telling the truth...and then there's telling the truth with a gentle tongue.", "Are you being serious? You tore apart his physical appearance and his personality and you want to know if yta? I think you know the answer\u2026.", "NAH, but just a bit harsh on your part", "I think it was right to bring up hobbies. What you said was correct, but it will also give him more opportunities to practice socializing with different types of people. Maybe even meet more women, either directly or through new mutual friends. I've also been told by several romantic partners that they find \"gaming\" unattractive in men.", "NTA. You provided him a different perspective from a girl's pov and gave pretty solid tips. It's now upto him whether he wants to follow those and work on himself.", "NTA. Plus I liked how you didn't once critique his physical characteristics that can't so easily be changed. It shows that there's hope and his weaknesses in attraction can be mitigated with effort", "NTA. If he wasn\u2019t prepared for the answer, he shouldn\u2019t have asked. You weren\u2019t being mean, you  were being honest and he didn\u2019t like what he heard.", "NTA. I would hope that one of my sons would give this kind of advice to his brother if asked.", "NAH- You probably should have checked how brutally honest he wanted you to be first, but the personal hygiene stuff needed to stay in regardless. I can't blame him for feeling a bit stung either. I would say it would probably help him to realign his thinking re the need for a relationship on a certain timescale, he doesn't need to tie it to his self-worth just because some adults lied to him when he was a kid. He's not less than just because girls didn't fawn over him. The advice re broadening out his interests and getting out more works for both. At a cooking class somewhere is a sweet girl whose sister just told her to ditch the book 1 Hermione hair and stripey sweaters, and get at least one more hobby that doesn't involve dice, and introduces herself with the caveat 'Just tell me stuff straight, I can be a bit dense sometimes!' After several years of classes they may even go for coffee.", "NTA on all points beside the hobbies. If Henry Cavill can play Magic and video games then anyone can. Appearance, job future and personality are way more important than hobbies. Once the first three are in order you'll likely find your type IN the hobby", "I'm a mother and when I was pregnant I asked my sis in law and brother to be guardians if something happened to me. My sis in law asked me if my child could call her mother. I said of course because my child would need a mom. I would want that for my child. \n\nYour SIL is very selfish not to want a mom for her niece. I do think you should be married before your daughter calls your gf mom in case you do break up.", "I mean, who would wanna date someone with greasy hair? I get the acne part cause sometimes it might be genetic but not washing the hair tells me he doesn't wash his face too.\n\nNTA. You're right.", "NTA. Maybe a little harsh, but he asked for advice and you provided it. You didn\u2019t sugarcoat stuff. And you offered solutions, where you actually offered your time to help.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just say \u201cyour hair looks dirty\u201d. You said \u201cyour hair looks dirty, maybe you should try a different shampoo and wash it more frequently, I can help you pick a new shampoo\u201d.\n\nI would add two things tho. Acne is a medical issue that sometimes doesn\u2019t go away with skincare, maybe he needs to go to a dermatologist. And the hobbies stuff could be worded differently. There is nothing wrong with only having gaming as a hobby, but I agree that he needs to broaden his interests and be more open to stuff. Also, going to the gym or doing a sport is wonderful advice for anyone, not only those looking for a partner. Your health is improved, your body looks better, you feel happier and with more energy, your skin improves, and you meet new people!", "I wouldn't necessarily say the hobbies part was uncalled for, not so much that he shouldn't have those hobbies, but have an awareness that, many potential partners don't have those hobbies, and, just blatantly don't care. \nI'm engaged to a nerd, my mind goes blank when they are talking about such things, I also have hobbies they don't find all that interesting, and that's okay, we talk about the things we are both interested in.", "INFO how did you tell your brother this? Did you just go \"you need to fix this, this and that\" all at once? Because that would absolutely crush anyone's self esteem and it would be hard to not take it as a personal attack.

It seems to be fairly common for people to look for partners based only on appearance, ignoring all the lifestyle conflicts. Your brother seems very low-maintence about his appearance - if he\u2019s constantly chasing after women who have a more high-maintence appearance, he will likely be ignored by them.  But if he tries to connect with women who are also fairly low-key he may have more success. \n\nNote that none that has to be an ugly/pretty divide.

One dance teacher even paid three of his friends to come in and help out.  The women always outnumber the men in those classes.   He will be fought over.  He will be asked to partner multiple women.  He will have to hold them and talk to them about learning new steps.  It doesn't even have to be ballroom, I  have seen this in country western dance and salsa classes too.  And in a recent line dancing class where you don't need a partner, there was only one man in the class and 30 women.  Guess who the most popular person was in that class.  \n\nAnd if he likes one woman in the classes, it would be easy to ask her out for a quick bite to eat before class or out dancing for extra practice.\n\nIf he is hesitant, get a group of friends together to enroll into a dance class so he can dip his toes in with a supportive group. \n\nOther benefits include that is is good exercise and when you are in your twenties, there are a lot of weddings to go to and an extra boost of dance skills come in handy.", "I\u2019m in the camp if your siblings can\u2019t say it who can?", "Is your brother on the spectrum by any chance? \n\nHe seems very similar to my own brother - lack of self awareness, self posturing, poor hygiene, difficulty with social cues, inability to see outside perspectives.
