It's going to be way harder to do things once the kid is there. \n\nThe odds of going from absolutely no signs of labor to ready to go to the hospital in the course of a few hours is very unlikely. \n\n\nIs he planning on getting so absolutely shit faced that he can't stand up for two days?", "NTA well, kudos to your husband for thinking the baby has the date circled on a little calendar- my first was a full month early. I would have a good back up plan in place, just in case. Do you have a friend or relative that could meet you there? I know that's what you don't want, but it's better to be prepared.", " NTA. I can see how it might be shitty for him but if he can\u2019t make small sacrifices now he\u2019s in for a rude awakening once he\u2019s a father.", "NAH \n\nI completely understand your thought process. I also understand his, the odds are low but what if? Could you have a friend or family member on standby if something happens? Let them know in advance and if they could be ready just in case.", "NTA. It is absolutely possible that you could go into labor 3 weeks early. It's not like you don't want him to drink just because you can't, you have a valid reason. He will be fine to stay sober for one birthday.", "NTA. As a person who was born over a month and 1/2 early. You should always be prepared. Especially that close to the due date.", "Surprisingly, I find myself saying NTA. Your concerns are 100% reasonable. You guys are about to have a baby, and it\u2019s all hands on deck crunch time now. It sucks for your husband to not be able to celebrate as he wants to, but as a parent, that\u2019s just his life now.", "NTA. My husband didn't drink for a month before my due date in case I went into labor. Is he OK with just having a couple drinks to celebrate or is he dead set on getting drunk? I'd remind him that just because it's a big birthday he is a parent and is going to need to make sacrifices for his children for the rest of his life.", "NTA.\n\nYou are asking him not to drink in fear of you going into labor and needing to get to the hospital.. this is beyond reasonable. You haven't drank for nearly 9 months, he can survive one night.", "NAH\n\nbut now that he's said you couldn't possible go into labor during those few hours...\n\nthat's exactly when you're gonna go into labor \ud83d\udc80\n\nI'd say the compromise here is having a backup driver or ride plan so he can celebrate the big bday and you can feel secure knowing you can get to the hospital safely if needed.", "NTA. This is a perfectly reasonable request, however because of how quickly he dismissed you, I can guarantee he won\u2019t abide by it.", "\"It's not fair\" is what a child says. You've been carrying a whole-ass human inside your body for 35 weeks. He can abstain from drinking on one day.

Pregnancy and childbirth go well for most, and even in those circumstances it can be scary and new with decisions to be made, let alone if there\u2019s a complication.\n\nSurprised your husband doesn\u2019t understand and want to be sober/mindfully present in case. Have you fully discussed your concerns with him? Base it around your feelings rather than logistics (if that\u2019s the real reason).\n\nAnd for those saying \u201cYTA\u201d wild that you make such a big deal about adult birthday parties and alcohol generally.", "Yes. You are.", "NAH. Maybe a compromise? Can he have a drink or two to celebrate but be sober enough in case anything should happen?", "NAH, needs compromise is all! Arrange so a family member can drive you, and your husband can drink but not too much so he can still be present and there for you if u go into labour :)", "Soft YTA. Taking an uber cuz he wants to drink is a good compromise. Trust me once your in active labour. You wont care how much damage a water stain or ur screaming will impact the people around you. Be prepared. Have some sort of plastic u can put down in the back of someone elses car. This will at least keep the mess as clean up free as possible.", "Soft YTA. I can understand where you're coming from as I have a 7 month old, but he won't be able to drink for a while after the baby is born. Let him enjoy his last birthday before he becomes a father. No one says he has to get shit faced but a few birthday drinks should be allowed.", "NAH. There's lots of sacrifices necessary when a couple decides to have a baby, on both sides, but all-in-all, it's the woman who has a harder go of it. Even if it's not completely logical (what's the chances you go into labor right then?), I feel like it's a valid concern. \n\nBut, I would also say two things: First, please be sure that you're actually worried about going into labor when he's too drunk to drive you, and not that you're just jealous he's out having a fun night you can't participate in. Second, you also should work on accepting that there is a chance you might get driven by someone else to the hospital, despite you and your husband's best intentions. Your car could not start when you go into labor, he could be at work and his cell phone battery dies, or whatever. Sure, you want him to be the one who brings you in, I get it, but it might not be what happens.", "You know there is a chance a plane could fall out of the sky onto your house, it\u2019s slim but possible, so you should probably never go home. \n\nThe man ain't gonna get a night out for 18 years once the baby arrives, let him have one last night of fun.", "NAH. I think both of you have a point. \nBeing anxious about this is normal and makes sense. Not only that, but it is a possibility that you may go into labor. \nYour husband has the right to want to celebrate how he wants. \nI think the best things to do is come up with a plan and make compromises. \n- Maybe let him drink a bit, just not get black out wasted or incoherent. \n- Have emergency bags already packed. \n-Have a DD for that night \n- make sure he keeps his ringer on, along with his friends so if it happens you can call him\nCompromises can be made, just talk about it.", "NAH.  I can see both sides.  You want him ready just in case and he just wants a drink on his birthday.  There's nothing wrong with either but you two need to talk more, have back up plans in case something happens.", "NAH... maybe? This one feels like it's easily solved with both of you just compromising a little. While I can see where you're coming from, the all or nothing of it all absolutely isn't fair. I personally think it would be much more reasonable to ask him to drink responsibly at a level that won't compromise his ability to support you if you do go into labour and also make a plan for a designated driver to be with you guys in case you do go into labour and he isn't able to drive. In my opinion, this is a situation pretty easily taken care of with compromise.", "Why can\u2019t you just have a back up plan for that one night? It is a pretty big day for him where he can have a drink or two with his friends.  And don\u2019t come at me with she hasn\u2019t drank in 8 months, blah blah blah.", "Meh. I\u2019m not going to say that Y T A, but let him have his fun. His life is going to change dramatically in the next few months, and you are going to need to count on him for a lot of help. Lack of sleep. Infants are no fun. There\u2019s no reason to start the restrictions early. I think insisting on this will end up bringing a little ill will into your relationship which is the last thing it needs on the eve of an arrival of a newborn. Pick your battles.", "Yta\n\nThat's a very movie version of labor, as your said the chances are slim. Make compromises, he won't get shit faced but can drink. You say it's just one birthday but chances are he won't be able to drink next birthday either, because he will have a baby. Not to mention if the baby's birthday does happen to fall next to his, his birthday will forever be overshadowed by his child's. \nIf you feel labor coming on that day, make accomodations and different plans. But I don't really think it's fair to ask him to give up his last \"free\" birthday for a small chance.", "NAH. Can\u2019t you reach a compromise that he can drink but he won\u2019t get drunk? If he just has a drink or two, he\u2019ll be sober in time to take you to the hospital. I don\u2019t understand why it has to be all or nothing", "I don't think either of you are necessarily right or wrong. You need to understand that he should be able to have fun on his birthday and you can't control what he wants to do. He needs to understand that this is all very unpredictable. It doesn't matter what the odds are, he should know what responsibilities are needed of him right now. Everyone knows the second you think something won't happen is when it will happen lol. A good solution would be for him to have a drink or two at home with his friends. Have a game night. Play with Nerf guns around the yard. Be goofy instead of getting shit face.  He shouldn't drink anything that'll get him drunk. A beer or two can be sipped on for hours without him getting even a little bit tipsy. It keeps him close by if anything happens, he can still have a fun time, and that should be a good compromise for both of you. If he's not willing to compromise he's the asshole for putting a fun night out over his wife and child. If you're not willing to compromise you're an asshole for not letting him have a little fun on his birthday.", "NAH You are not unreasonable to be worried that you might go into labor on his birthday. Babies are born prematurely all the time. You could go into labor right now and still have a perfectly healthy baby!  That said, the odds that you'll go into labor on his birthday are low, so if it means that much to him to drink (which it sounds like it does), I'd ask a friend, relative, or neighbor to help you in the event you go into labor that night. If you are worried about mucking up someone's car, buy a waterproof pad you can put underneath you.", "NAH. Valid concern from your end and also valid for him to want to have a drink or two on his birthday. Any chance of finding a DD? Seems like the easiest compromise.", "NTA\n\nHowever you could always have a backup person a friend who is going to hangout with you for the evening incase you need to have transport to the hospital.\n\nHopefully you will give birth when little one is nearer to full term (so not on his birthday) but little one will come when they are ready.", "[deleted]", "INFO:  Do you two not have any friends (who can drive) to share his birthday with?  I've been the DD for friend's birthdays before.  (I think that in general, if you're going out for a birthday and someone has to stay sober to drive, it shouldn't be the person whose birthday it is.  )", "YTA.  Just make other arrangements for that evening and make sure your husband is on board for coming with you.  You can have someone you know on call.  This seems over controlling for something that may never happen. Full disclosure, I am female with 2 children.", "INFO: Does he drink other days? Are you expecting him not to drink at all until you go into labor? Do you have a close relative that can be on standby with your car, while your husband can take an Uber? I'm just not understanding your reasoning fully.", "Nta", "NTA.   Not only does he need to drive you but you\u2019ll also need a support person at the hospital and he won\u2019t be able to perform that role if he\u2019s drunk or hungover.   You\u2019re not asking a lot here.", "YTA - not to drink\n\nNTA - Please do not get drunk as.the due date approaches.", "NTA I was 3 weeks premature and my dad was in another country because my parents planned to my due date, so he missed my birth and my mom had to do it alone. This is such a tiny sacrifice for your husband to make it's ridiculous he's even putting up a fight.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely reasonable request to not be imparied if you need his help for the MUTUAL pregnancy.\n\nHe sounds very immature and clueless about what he's going to be giving up a lot of shortly.", "YTA. And if it matters to you, I\u2019m a mother of 3. He will only resent you for this because it\u2019s selfish. You can\u2019t pre-arrange an alternate ride, with him as a passenger, on the off chance you go into labor during his birthday party? Of course you can. You just don\u2019t want to. \n\nBtw, good luck. I drove myself to the hospital with my first through no one\u2019s fault except the baby was coming and my husband was 1.5 hours away by car. Our kid is 22 now. Prepare for your birth plan to not go to plan.\n\nETA: OP left out all the relevant info and put it in the comments instead. Everyone jumping down my neck and creating a fictional history for me in their heads is really annoying.", "NTA and all of these Y T A comments are insane omg. Asking someone not to drink one time on their birthday because you might literally pop out a human is not going to cause lifelong resentment and marital issues lmfao", "NTA. But you\u2019ve just discovered how much of a partner your husband is going to be as a parent a little late. I\u2019m really sorry but his happiness will apparently always come before what you and you children need.", "YTA\n\nWhen your waters break it's not like on tv at all. You have to wait till you're at least 4 cm dilated to go the hospital otherwise they turn you away, unless you've been at 4cm for a while. \n\nLet him have a drink. \n\nGet your mum to stay sober if you're so concerned. \n\nTalk to people who have actually had kids to get a feel for what to expect and ignore what's on the tv.", "[removed]", "Yes, YTA for even asking. \n\nIt\u2019s his 30th. There\u2019s no need to control him. You will get to the hospital ok regardless", "NTA - it is simply not worth the risk and he should be able to recognise that. You unfortunately have no control over when the baby may come and so for him to be saying that there's 'no way you will go into labour in that time frame' is ridiculous, no one can be sure of that. \n\nThere will be many other events for him to attend and enjoy a drink after the baby has arrived, if he cannot sacrifice alcohol this one time I worry about  his priorities in life.", "ESH. I really do understand your concern and you\u2019re right, he could pass on drinking for once. But a compromise could have been made here that neither of you tried to reach. What about celebrating the birthday in advance or later, so that he can drink all he wants without the risk of missing the birth ? Earlier is smarter by the way, having a newborn will be exhausting for both parents. What about he drinks reasonably and someone is determined to be the driver just in case for that night, that would bring you both if needed to the hospital and won\u2019t be there / won\u2019t drink ? If he drinks but is not drunk or waisted, there is no reason he would not be able to support you through this. Your child will only be born once and I know he do have birthdays every year. It would not be that much of a deal to miss it. But if there\u2019s a way to make both work, I would try this road first. You can be an incredible parent and still consider your own life important. His desire to not skip his 30th birthday, which is a milestone too, doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t care for you or your child as much.", "INFO\n\nWould it be possible to have a friend or family member stay with you the night of his birthday just on the off chance you go into labor?\n\nWouldn't it also be possible to talk to his friends and tell him that if you do go into labor, they need to get him in an uber and get him to the hospital?\n\nWouldn't that be a fair compromise?", "now, typically i don't get behind the whole \"i'm pregnant, so WE can't drink\" BS...but this is different. despite the chances being slim, as you say, they do exist, and for that reason, alone, he should be willing to remain sober. he'd likely regret being inebriated during the birth of your child, and not being able to be the one who transports you safely to the hospital to deliver your baby.

This makes perfect sense.", "Yta....\nWhen your pregnant it's different then when your not.\nMake sure someone can drive you and let the man enjoy his birthday.\nJust ask if he can slow it down so he will be able to know whats going on IF you get to deliver the baby its his last bday without kids", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve heard of women that literally just start the birthing process with their waters breaking. I was one of them. Looking back, there were some signs, but I didn\u2019t realise a dodgy stomach and back ache (which I had on and off due to pregnancy lol) were signs. Literally, waters broke then complete panic :) \n\nYou entered into parenthood as a partnership. Pregnancy is the first bit of parenthood. You need him to be present and fit to drive.

You don't just feel it coming, then it pops out in the next hour.   First, it's highly unlikely you'll deliver 3 weeks before you're due.  Second, even if you do start to have the baby on his bday, you'll have plenty of time for him to sober up.  Your water will break, hubby stops drinking, you'll start to have contractions while he sobers up, then, typically, after a few hours (even 24-36), when your contractions are close enough apart, you'll head to the hospital.

Why rob him of it? The fact that you made it a point to say you haven't had a drink in 8 months says it's more about you wanting him to be denied like you have been. You tossing that out there shows it's not just about your worry, but that you're being vindictive about it instead, and that makes you the asshole. \n\nI'll also point out that he's going out with friends - did you consider having his friends over? Doing something special for a milestone birthday for him? Making it special at home? Because from the sound of it, his only opportunity to celebrate is grabbing a few drinks with friends, and you want that taken away as an option. \n\nBeing pregnant doesn't give an excuse to be vindictive or to disregard your husband's feelings - which is what you're doing here, then looking for sympathy on the internet over.", "At first, I thought OP was being unreasonable.

Could he celebrate a little earlier than his actual birthday to decrease the likelihood of labour occurring at the time of the party? Could you make a plan for a birthday do over later in the year, or for his 31st and make it extra special?

I took my husband to an October fest when I was 38 weeks pregnant. Guess who\u2019s water broke that evening, and guess who was still drunk? I drove us to get some food and then to the hospital. After a couple hours He had a little nappy nap while I started some Pitocin. It\u2019s one of my favorite stories to tell. It was funny and he was fine by the time I was really laboring. The chances of it happening on that particular night at 35 weeks, coupled with the chances of your labor progressing that fast, is pretty damn slim.

I don\u2019t think either is an AH but they both have valid feelings.

Personally I wouldn\u2019t have stopped my husband going out drinking if he wanted to, but equally, I wouldn\u2019t need to say anything because he would make that decision of his own accord anyway. We had a similar scenario where he had tickets to an annual event that he attends with his friends where they all get absolutely smashed, which was scheduled for the night before my due date.

It\u2019s \u201cso how can we get to the hospital if you\u2019re tipsy and I go into labor\u201d  have a DD who will agree to be on call, or a family member fly in to stay with you for the weekend just in case.

I would guess it\u2019s the latter. I know that you should be prepared for everything when you\u2019re having a baby but this is a little extreme.
