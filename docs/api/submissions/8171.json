It's going to be way harder to do things once the kid is there. \n\nThe odds of going from absolutely no signs of labor to ready to go to the hospital in the course of a few hours is very unlikely. \n\n\nIs he planning on getting so absolutely shit faced that he can't stand up for two days?", "NTA well, kudos to your husband for thinking the baby has the date circled on a little calendar- my first was a full month early. I would have a good back up plan in place, just in case. Do you have a friend or relative that could meet you there? I know that's what you don't want, but it's better to be prepared.", " NTA.

I also understand his, the odds are low but what if? Could you have a friend or family member on standby if something happens? Let them know in advance and if they could be ready just in case.", "NTA. It is absolutely possible that you could go into labor 3 weeks early. It's not like you don't want him to drink just because you can't, you have a valid reason. He will be fine to stay sober for one birthday.", "NTA. As a person who was born over a month and 1/2 early. You should always be prepared. Especially that close to the due date.", "Surprisingly, I find myself saying NTA. Your concerns are 100% reasonable. You guys are about to have a baby, and it\u2019s all hands on deck crunch time now. It sucks for your husband to not be able to celebrate as he wants to, but as a parent, that\u2019s just his life now.", "NTA. My husband didn't drink for a month before my due date in case I went into labor. Is he OK with just having a couple drinks to celebrate or is he dead set on getting drunk? I'd remind him that just because it's a big birthday he is a parent and is going to need to make sacrifices for his children for the rest of his life.", "NTA.\n\nYou are asking him not to drink in fear of you going into labor and needing to get to the hospital.. this is beyond reasonable. You haven't drank for nearly 9 months, he can survive one night.", "NAH\n\nbut now that he's said you couldn't possible go into labor during those few hours...\n\nthat's exactly when you're gonna go into labor \ud83d\udc80\n\nI'd say the compromise here is having a backup driver or ride plan so he can celebrate the big bday and you can feel secure knowing you can get to the hospital safely if needed.", "NTA. This is a perfectly reasonable request, however because of how quickly he dismissed you, I can guarantee he won\u2019t abide by it.", "\"It's not fair\" is what a child says. You've been carrying a whole-ass human inside your body for 35 weeks. He can abstain from drinking on one day.

Pregnancy and childbirth go well for most, and even in those circumstances it can be scary and new with decisions to be made, let alone if there\u2019s a complication.\n\nSurprised your husband doesn\u2019t understand and want to be sober/mindfully present in case. Have you fully discussed your concerns with him? Base it around your feelings rather than logistics (if that\u2019s the real reason).\n\nAnd for those saying \u201cYTA\u201d wild that you make such a big deal about adult birthday parties and alcohol generally.", "Yes. You are.", "NAH. Maybe a compromise? Can he have a drink or two to celebrate but be sober enough in case anything should happen?", "NAH, needs compromise is all! Arrange so a family member can drive you, and your husband can drink but not too much so he can still be present and there for you if u go into labour :)", "Soft YTA. Taking an uber cuz he wants to drink is a good compromise. Trust me once your in active labour. You wont care how much damage a water stain or ur screaming will impact the people around you. Be prepared. Have some sort of plastic u can put down in the back of someone elses car. This will at least keep the mess as clean up free as possible.", "Soft YTA. I can understand where you're coming from as I have a 7 month old, but he won't be able to drink for a while after the baby is born. Let him enjoy his last birthday before he becomes a father. No one says he has to get shit faced but a few birthday drinks should be allowed.", "NAH. There's lots of sacrifices necessary when a couple decides to have a baby, on both sides, but all-in-all, it's the woman who has a harder go of it. Even if it's not completely logical (what's the chances you go into labor right then?), I feel like it's a valid concern. \n\nBut, I would also say two things: First, please be sure that you're actually worried about going into labor when he's too drunk to drive you, and not that you're just jealous he's out having a fun night you can't participate in. Second, you also should work on accepting that there is a chance you might get driven by someone else to the hospital, despite you and your husband's best intentions. Your car could not start when you go into labor, he could be at work and his cell phone battery dies, or whatever. Sure, you want him to be the one who brings you in, I get it, but it might not be what happens.", "You know there is a chance a plane could fall out of the sky onto your house, it\u2019s slim but possible, so you should probably never go home. \n\nThe man ain't gonna get a night out for 18 years once the baby arrives, let him have one last night of fun.", "NAH. I think both of you have a point. \nBeing anxious about this is normal and makes sense. Not only that, but it is a possibility that you may go into labor. \nYour husband has the right to want to celebrate how he wants. \nI think the best things to do is come up with a plan and make compromises. \n- Maybe let him drink a bit, just not get black out wasted or incoherent. \n- Have emergency bags already packed. \n-Have a DD for that night \n- make sure he keeps his ringer on, along with his friends so if it happens you can call him\nCompromises can be made, just talk about it.", "NAH.  I can see both sides.  You want him ready just in case and he just wants a drink on his birthday.  There's nothing wrong with either but you two need to talk more, have back up plans in case something happens.", "NAH... maybe? This one feels like it's easily solved with both of you just compromising a little. While I can see where you're coming from, the all or nothing of it all absolutely isn't fair. I personally think it would be much more reasonable to ask him to drink responsibly at a level that won't compromise his ability to support you if you do go into labour and also make a plan for a designated driver to be with you guys in case you do go into labour and he isn't able to drive. In my opinion, this is a situation pretty easily taken care of with compromise.", "Why can\u2019t you just have a back up plan for that one night? It is a pretty big day for him where he can have a drink or two with his friends.  And don\u2019t come at me with she hasn\u2019t drank in 8 months, blah blah blah.", "Meh. I\u2019m not going to say that Y T A, but let him have his fun. His life is going to change dramatically in the next few months, and you are going to need to count on him for a lot of help. Lack of sleep. Infants are no fun. There\u2019s no reason to start the restrictions early. I think insisting on this will end up bringing a little ill will into your relationship which is the last thing it needs on the eve of an arrival of a newborn. Pick your battles.", "Yta\n\nThat's a very movie version of labor, as your said the chances are slim. Make compromises, he won't get shit faced but can drink. You say it's just one birthday but chances are he won't be able to drink next birthday either, because he will have a baby. Not to mention if the baby's birthday does happen to fall next to his, his birthday will forever be overshadowed by his child's. \nIf you feel labor coming on that day, make accomodations and different plans. But I don't really think it's fair to ask him to give up his last \"free\" birthday for a small chance.", "NAH. Can\u2019t you reach a compromise that he can drink but he won\u2019t get drunk? If he just has a drink or two, he\u2019ll be sober in time to take you to the hospital. I don\u2019t understand why it has to be all or nothing", "I don't think either of you are necessarily right or wrong. You need to understand that he should be able to have fun on his birthday and you can't control what he wants to do. He needs to understand that this is all very unpredictable. It doesn't matter what the odds are, he should know what responsibilities are needed of him right now. Everyone knows the second you think something won't happen is when it will happen lol. A good solution would be for him to have a drink or two at home with his friends. Have a game night. Play with Nerf guns around the yard. Be goofy instead of getting shit face.  He shouldn't drink anything that'll get him drunk. A beer or two can be sipped on for hours without him getting even a little bit tipsy. It keeps him close by if anything happens, he can still have a fun time, and that should be a good compromise for both of you. If he's not willing to compromise he's the asshole for putting a fun night out over his wife and child. If you're not willing to compromise you're an asshole for not letting him have a little fun on his birthday.", "NAH You are not unreasonable to be worried that you might go into labor on his birthday. Babies are born prematurely all the time. You could go into labor right now and still have a perfectly healthy baby!  That said, the odds that you'll go into labor on his birthday are low, so if it means that much to him to drink (which it sounds like it does), I'd ask a friend, relative, or neighbor to help you in the event you go into labor that night. If you are worried about mucking up someone's car, buy a waterproof pad you can put underneath you.", "NAH. Valid concern from your end and also valid for him to want to have a drink or two on his birthday. Any chance of finding a DD? Seems like the easiest compromise.", "NTA\n\nHowever you could always have a backup person a friend who is going to hangout with you for the evening incase you need to have transport to the hospital.\n\nHopefully you will give birth when little one is nearer to full term (so not on his birthday) but little one will come when they are ready.", "[deleted]", "INFO:  Do you two not have any friends (who can drive) to share his birthday with?

Just make other arrangements for that evening and make sure your husband is on board for coming with you.  You can have someone you know on call.  This seems over controlling for something that may never happen. Full disclosure, I am female with 2 children.", "INFO: Does he drink other days? Are you expecting him not to drink at all until you go into labor? Do you have a close relative that can be on standby with your car, while your husband can take an Uber? I'm just not understanding your reasoning fully.", "Nta", "NTA.   Not only does he need to drive you but you\u2019ll also need a support person at the hospital and he won\u2019t be able to perform that role if he\u2019s drunk or hungover.   You\u2019re not asking a lot here.", "YTA - not to drink\n\nNTA - Please do not get drunk as.the due date approaches.", "NTA I was 3 weeks premature and my dad was in another country because my parents planned to my due date, so he missed my birth and my mom had to do it alone.

You can\u2019t pre-arrange an alternate ride, with him as a passenger, on the off chance you go into labor during his birthday party? Of course you can. You just don\u2019t want to. \n\nBtw, good luck. I drove myself to the hospital with my first through no one\u2019s fault except the baby was coming and my husband was 1.5 hours away by car.

You will get to the hospital ok regardless", "NTA - it is simply not worth the risk and he should be able to recognise that. You unfortunately have no control over when the baby may come and so for him to be saying that there's 'no way you will go into labour in that time frame' is ridiculous, no one can be sure of that. \n\nThere will be many other events for him to attend and enjoy a drink after the baby has arrived, if he cannot sacrifice alcohol this one time I worry about  his priorities in life.", "ESH. I really do understand your concern and you\u2019re right, he could pass on drinking for once. But a compromise could have been made here that neither of you tried to reach. What about celebrating the birthday in advance or later, so that he can drink all he wants without the risk of missing the birth ? Earlier is smarter by the way, having a newborn will be exhausting for both parents. What about he drinks reasonably and someone is determined to be the driver just in case for that night, that would bring you both if needed to the hospital and won\u2019t be there / won\u2019t drink ? If he drinks but is not drunk or waisted, there is no reason he would not be able to support you through this. Your child will only be born once and I know he do have birthdays every year. It would not be that much of a deal to miss it. But if there\u2019s a way to make both work, I would try this road first. You can be an incredible parent and still consider your own life important. His desire to not skip his 30th birthday, which is a milestone too, doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t care for you or your child as much.", "INFO\n\nWould it be possible to have a friend or family member stay with you the night of his birthday just on the off chance you go into labor?\n\nWouldn't it also be possible to talk to his friends and tell him that if you do go into labor, they need to get him in an uber and get him to the hospital?\n\nWouldn't that be a fair compromise?", "now, typically i don't get behind the whole \"i'm pregnant, so WE can't drink\" BS...but this is different. despite the chances being slim, as you say, they do exist, and for that reason, alone, he should be willing to remain sober. he'd likely regret being inebriated during the birth of your child, and not being able to be the one who transports you safely to the hospital to deliver your baby.

You don't just feel it coming, then it pops out in the next hour.   First, it's highly unlikely you'll deliver 3 weeks before you're due.  Second, even if you do start to have the baby on his bday, you'll have plenty of time for him to sober up.  Your water will break, hubby stops drinking, you'll start to have contractions while he sobers up, then, typically, after a few hours (even 24-36), when your contractions are close enough apart, you'll head to the hospital.
