The first is about you're willingness to help out with things that need to be done.

That apparently involves a lot of work and he's found a way to get things done without losing more money on his friend.   IMO, asking you to do that would be reasonable providing you had sufficient notice and it didn't conflict with your own plans.\n\nIn other words, it was unreasonable for him to think you were obligated to drop your plans for this, especially when he had other options.
