From living there, I learned that it\u2019s hard to apply our moral standards/ make judgments in an environment that is almost unimaginable to someone whose mental framework largely developed in the States. In Haiti, access to reliable birth control likely doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s not a medical system to support accessible, safe abortion. Sex is a part of adult life, and when there are few accessible comforts and joys, companionship takes on a different role. Having many children is a strong cultural value.
