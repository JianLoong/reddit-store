Hmmm shady. 3) so we can post you being disrespectful and trash talking me saying, \"When I'm just being a person you find that gross!\" Oh? Then why are you with me?? I know not everything I do you're gonna love but that sets GF up for a, \"Plead the victim card\" reeeaaal fast. 4) As a female when you see other girls trash talking their partner you comprehend, \"Ooooh you're one of THOSE who feels the need to tear others down just for a trend.
