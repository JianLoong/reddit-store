I say go to war insult her and openly embarrasse her in front of her friends and say, \"New ick unlocked.... Yup you saw exactly what I've been talking about.\" Don't even post the video just pretend to make one and mess with her head. Then when she realizes it's all fake and it \"bothered her\" ooooh babe it's just a trend. Same goes with faux cheating \"Babe it's a dummy I made!

BF would be cancelled ASAP or he's seen as \"problematic\" \"toxic\" a \"red flag\". I genuinely hate \"trends\" that feel a need to bring your partner down.

Hmmm shady. 3) so we can post you being disrespectful and trash talking me saying, \"When I'm just being a person you find that gross!\" Oh? Then why are you with me?? I know not everything I do you're gonna love but that sets GF up for a, \"Plead the victim card\" reeeaaal fast. 4) As a female when you see other girls trash talking their partner you comprehend, \"Ooooh you're one of THOSE who feels the need to tear others down just for a trend.
