I have had a really good relationship with his daughter since meeting her, in fact its been really good to where she actually moved in with us! I have no issue with that at all. I really do love her. When she moved in I did have a conversation with her and told her some  rules  I have for me. One  I am not a taxi (she's 15, so being with her friends is a must lol) I told her I can either pick  her up or drop her off but I will not do both. Two. I told her going to school is a must, and Three. If she has any issues to come and talk to her dad or I. We will not judge her, we have both been in high school and know a few things haha. Everything has been going good until school started. Her dad and I both work well past the time she gets off of school and we aren't able to leave to go pick her up, So we told her she can go to the one friends house or her aunts house. Her choice she just needs to let us know which one she is at and we will pick her up when we are off of work. Well the other day she went to her friends house and well before I was supposed to get off she texts and asks if I could go pick her up right away, that her friend was leaving. I told her there was no way I could leave right then and there as to someone already left and I was needed to stay. I felt really bad for not being able to go pick her but also pissed off because her friend was leaving. Her aunt was able to go pick her up from her friends house and also brought her home. Now today I get a text that she is with her friend but they are going to the friends moms house which is twenty five minutes away from where we live. I'm pissed off now because one she did not ask if she could go she just said thats where she was and two I still have to go home and cook dinner and now from an already exhausting day I have to drive 25 mins there and 25 mins back. so almost a whole damn hour of driving. \n\n\nFor those wondering her background and why the aunt is in the picture.. She lived with her aunt for most of her life. Her mom gave up custody of her and has no contact with her at all! My husband was fighting for her but she wasn't ready to leave her aunt and sisters until now!", "created_utc": 1693366956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1653ujf/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_pick_up_my_stepdaughter/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s just something you guys have to work through. But you\u2019re totally not an asshole for not wanting to leave work early to chauffeur her around her social events. \n\nIs a Uber or bus a safe option here?", "INFO - why is she not ringing her dad, and what are his thoughts on this? Why can\u2019t stepdaughter just go to your house after school and hang out until you get home?", " NAH It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to pick her up. You can\u2019t. You\u2019re going to have to change the after school rules. She can go to her friend\u2019s house if she\u2019s 100% certain she\u2019ll be there when it\u2019s time to be picked up. Otherwise, she needs to go to her aunt\u2019s house. \n\nNot a big deal.", "Nta.\n\nI think you need to have a conversation with your husband along the lines that if she isn't at one of the two places, then he needs to pick her up or arrange for her ride (Uber or whatever).", "INFO: could your husband have made that particular trip?

I understand his views but I feel he\u2019s way over protective of her and I feel like learning how to take the bus or public transportation would help her in the long run!", "I\u2019m actually not sure why she doesn\u2019t text her dad. She\u2019s always texting me and asking me for most things, which I\u2019m okay with and most of the time I talk to my husband before I give her an answer so he\u2019s in the loop. As for her going home after school, we live to far for her to walk but not far enough to where she can learn the bus route.", "I did have a discussion with her dad about not giving her a choice anymore and she needs to go to her aunts house.", "15 years old is old enough to be riding the public bus and have a house key. Buses are loaded with cameras and it's a necessary skill for her to learn. I was going to the mall and library on the bus when I was in middle school, and that was when I just had a flip phone without GPS.\n\nHe could do a \"ride along\" with her on the weekend to lessen his anxiety, and have her get familiar with the route.\n\nIt also might be a good idea to encourage  your step-daughter to join after-schools clubs or activities so that she's not running around town going to unknown locations.", "Well, it really depends on the neighborhood. \n\nIf he\u2019s so protective\u2026 maybe he can be in charge of transportation for his daughter? Hmm?", "It is good! Me and my sisters started taking the bus when we were starting grade 4. My dad rode the route to school with us once and then followed behind in his van when we took it the second time. \n\nIt made me so comfortable with transit that I'm 30 and still don't drive. So it *can* backfire lmao", "Then perhaps he should be the one to collect her?", "A bicycle? Electric scooter?   \nMy daughter is 13. She cycles every day to school, 6 km (ca 4 miles). Only when the weather is very bad, she takes the bus.   \nWhy American teenagers can work in shops, fastfoods etc., but can't cycle alone to school?", "Teens are pretty dumb. They don\u2019t think ahead, and they\u2019re often worried about speaking up. I think requiring her to consider when & where she be picked up might be better than taking away the decision. It\u2019s better to teach her & require that she make a considered decision.", "That\u2019s exactly what I said. We were all riding the bus WITHOUT GPS and we were fine. I even told him we can get her pepper spray or a taser for her safety.", "Lots of places in the US are built only for cars\u2014no sidewalks, multiple lanes of fast-moving traffic\u2014and biking isn\u2019t safe for anyone.", "INFO: Why the taxi rule? The one where you will only give a ride one way. If someone needs a ride to get somewhere then they need a ride to get back. Why not just limit it, say you will take her back and forth to a friend's house once a week. Children who can't drive and who don't live in safe enough areas for bicycle rides need someone else to drive them. This does not make you a taxi service. Now if you're busy with a work commitment or something, then say that.", "Here 7 year olds ride a bus alone.", "I would rather get her selfdefense classes. Tools can be used against her or abused by her. Not saying that it will but it is always a possibility. Self defense has a major confidence boost factor so she will also feel more comfortable"]}
