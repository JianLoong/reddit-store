It's more the context. OP tried to switch during the introductions. In other words, a time when the whole circle is talking together.

True, the very word \"fran\u00e7ais\" is related to \"France,\" but too bad: if they wanted to keep it as a cool, local thing they shouldn't have gone out and colonized as much of the world as they could.

French is an inescapable part of our daily lives, and yet I don\u2019t speak French. At all. Most anglophones don\u2019t. \n\nConversely, Quebec recently passed laws heavily restricting the use of English and the employment of English speakers in their province, in a predominantly English speaking country which has English as one of their official languages as well.
