Not at that age. \n\nINFO: Does he adapt well to change and new people/situations? I can't imagine my daughter wanting to spend hours of her day with strangers, away from me, when we were on a trip together when she was that age. She's 11 and I'm not sure she'd want to do that now unless her friends or cousins were there.

You never know what will stick with him.", "Im a yoga instructor and have done out of country trainings/retreats.  I\u2019ve also taken classes at a studio while my son was in another room doing yoga. He was probably 6-7 at the time.  First, I\u2019m going to say NAH but I want to raise a few points.  You absolutely are robbing yourself of a full immersion experience if you take your child.  Your child won\u2019t learn as much as you want to in the amount of time you\u2019ll be there. A kid that old can only comprehend so much impulse control.  You absolutely will wonder how he\u2019s doing in his classes.  It\u2019s easier to turn off being a mom when the child is out of reach.  Your son will be away from his world in Greece which might make him more clingy putting more stress on you.  \n\nI understand how hard it is to leave your kid.  For my 200 hour training, I was in Costa Rica for 15 days.  My son was in pre K at the time.  \n\nYour mom is 100% correct that you won\u2019t get what you need from the retreat.  And think about how much more you\u2019ll be frustrated if she is annoying you with how you parent.  \n\nI think, from my real life experience, that you will get much more from any retreat without a child.  I also think that you should consider looking into a retreat that doesn\u2019t allow children if it\u2019s not too late for that.  If you\u2019ve never gone on a retreat like this before, you learn and heal.  You get real deep with the others really quick.  You have the opportunity to grow, find your identity that can be lost as a wife and a mother.  Your soul is transformed.  I don\u2019t know you but I\u2019d hate for anyone to rob themselves of a beautiful opportunity to evolve. I think that will happen if you bring your child.  \n\nPlease sit with this.  Meditate. Journal. Bring it to your mat.  You have the answer already.  If your husband is taking care of 2 what is one more? Is it fear of leaving your baby behind? Do you not really want to go with your mother? \n\nGood luck and I hope whatever you decide you are provided with the journey you deserve.\n\nEdit: I just read that your mom is an anxious traveler.  You might need to consider letting her back out. I think a solo trip would be the most beneficial.  You deserve this time. Don\u2019t allow others to take this away from you", "She has yo want to find peace.  Maybe starting local would be a better journey for her.  Maybe a workshop or a weekend retreat.  10 days can be a lot if you\u2019re not ready.  I tell my students that part of healing is opening boxes that you\u2019ve packed away in the back of you mind.  You have to be ready to go through those boxes and toss out what no longer serves you.  Is that something you want to do with your mother.  Especially if there is stress around your relationship with her.  You might need to unpack those boxes alone so you can come home and sort through the stuff with your mom.  My mom and I are extremely close.  She is so freaking amazing but I wouldn\u2019t want to go on a retreat with her.  I don\u2019t feel like she would fully be able to let go and I might not be able to do the same.  There is a lot of emotional purging and how would either of you respond to the other possibly having a breakdown to get to a break through?  \n\nOn the flip side, do you think doing it together would help your relationship? You might feel safe enough to express some of your feelings that you might not be bold enough to do at home.

I always read books written by 4.5 years olds about how transformational their yoga holidays have been and how they found their inner peace :).

If my grandma had pulled something like this when I was a child, and it was her or me: the answer would have always been me. Every.
