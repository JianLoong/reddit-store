It\u2019s a good Christian camp, how could they treat someone like your step sister so poorly. JK\n\nTwo issues and hopefully if you\u2019re going to work or college you\u2019ll get part of your life back. I\u2019d suggest a college that\u2019s feasible and as far away as you can get (and still afford). It\u2019s great you help your step sister but she\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be your chore to take care of for the the rest of your life. You need to grow and it looks like she holds you back. \n\nThe other issues is the religion being force on you and you made the right call.", "definitely nta, its not your responsibility to look after her, it's primarily her mothers, and now ur dad i suppose? but no its also good u got out of going to that place anyway", "\"Dad said mom would be ashamed of me and I told him she'd be ashamed of him trying to pawn off parenting onto me and she would never have been okay with any of this. He told me I was being cruel.\"\n\nNTA.  You are totally right.  Daddy is calling you cruel, as your words really stung...because he knew you were right on target.", "NTA Anne's kid is NOT your problem. She can go to camp by herself, you can enjoy your summer without having to babysit a 15YO (who again is NOT your responsibility).", "NTA - you are not a parent and it is not your role in life to do that. Fact you had to engineer a way out rather than be able to say \"I'm not her parent\" is what hurts most here. Make it clear you are a minor and WILL NOT accept guardian responsibility", "NTA at all and your dad and stepmother should be ashamed of themselves. Anne is not your responsibility. Of course you need to treat her with kindness and respect, but expecting you to be constantly at her side - at the expense of your own friendships and interests - is grossly unfair. They are trying to make you into a proxy parent. If Anne needs ongoing supervision they need to make a plan for that - one that doesn't involve you.\n\nINFO: what was the situation before your dad married Anne's mom? Who was \"supervising\" her?", "NTA.  Honestly, is there another family member that you could live with?  What are they going to do when you finish high school, force you to live at home and go to a local CC? \n\nIt's not right that your father and stepmother are pushing this much childcare on to you.", "NTA, reminds me of another reddit post I read where the mom and step-dad did the exact same thing to OP. They forced her to take her autistic stepsister everywhere even her after school clubs. And when it was time for college they tried to force her to go to college in state or have her stepsis move in with her bc stepsis would have a huge meltdown if she couldn't always be around OP. It got to the point that the day OP turned 18 she ran away told the cops and neighbor that she was leaving and she wasn't missing changed her number and moved in with her bf. If your dad and Anne don't step up and stop trying to push your stepsis onto you then I would go NC the day I turned 18.", "NTA this is not your child. And furthermore shame on them for not wanting to parent their own child. And putting it on a 25 yr old. Let them fume it\u2019s not your job.", "I think that sacrificing a good portion of your summer for your special needs sister is in itself a little bit too much to ask of a 16 year old, let alone doing it at a place that doesn't align with your moral values. If your parents worry so much about her, they should arrange for accommodation that is not dependant on your going. NTA", "NTA \n\nAlso, stop hanging out with her at school, especially lunch. You need to have time with your own friends. Don't be mean, just refuse to interact with her at all. Let her make friends in her grade and let the school deal with her.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely not the ah here. Your stepsister is not your responsibility. Your father and stepmother are the AHs for trying to push this on you. They need to work with the church running the camp to get accommodations for Anne's daughter.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with them asking you to to help them on occasion. This isn\u2019t that though. They are making you be her quasi babysitter which isn\u2019t cool. At least they should pick activities that both people could enjoy as 15/16 is really too old for a day camp unless it\u2019s targeted for special needs individuals.", "NTA and good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA, your father and step-mom sounds controlling as fuck, have you thought of moving in with your mom", "Your step-sister deserves to be happy.  She requires more attention and care than you; your dad and his wife believe you can help with that.  Your reluctance to be the big sister she needs *is* selfish.  Your plot to leave her with no support system in a strange environment *is* devious and cruel. \n\nOn the other hand, you had no say in who he married, how that has changed him, and how the dynamic of the family unit has been shifted.  His motivations are righteous but his execution has been flawed.  You are kin to this girl now, but you're not her parent nor her bodyguard.  \n\nESH", "NTA and good for you. When no one advocates for you, you have to do it for yourself. I hope you have a plan and a means to get yourself into a college far far away so you can have your life back", "NTA, and I'm glad you did what you had to do. I think your comment to your dad was exactly correct and that's why he had such a strong reaction- he knows you're right.", "NTA, your not cruel, but your father and step mother are.  Anne is her, or their responsibility, not yours.  This isn't to say you couldn't occasionally help out.  That said when your father and step mother hooked up, they saw you as the perfect solution to releasing step mom from her daily care and responsibilities of your autistic step sister.  It was never your responsibility to be her primary caretaker, the one who abandoned her was Anne and your father.  Your so NTA.", "NTA but if they are worried about her being bullied at Christian camp they picked the wrong Christian camp (yes I know being bullied at Christian camp/any camp is common, but they should be smacked with this irony. \n\nHow are they unaware that her dignity depends on her having appropriate instruction and supports that are \u2026 not you, and that it\u2019s ableist and ignorant of them to just put her in your charge?  She deserves the supports to which she is entitled, and that\u2019s not a forced parentified relationship with her step sibling.  \n\nUnderstanding it from her perspective may also help you get out of the resentment.  Your step sister has the right to relationships with her family/household members.  Right now this dynamic is preventing that for her too.  Your parents are being A H toward her by not supporting her autonomy, self-advocacy and a healthy relationship with you.", "NTA but oh your dad and step mom sure are. Looks like you are going to be stuck in a bad situation for a while so I\u2019d do something to help yourself out that you may be uncomfortable with. Hear me out\u2026\nThey respect god and church. Go talk to their pastor. Tell him what you\u2019ve told us. Tell him how it affects your mental health and that you need support and not to be a caregiver. Maybe he can talk to them about taking this role from you. It may be the only way they will change their ways.", "They are definitely doing parentification. Nice job by the way! Make sure to study hard and apply for a lot scholarships so you can hopefully move asap cause this won\u2019t end.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right--they're pawning off parenting onto you, and that's not acceptable.\n\nOn top of that, you didn't lie. You are not a member of that church and have no desire to participate in that camp or their beliefs.\n\nIf they're good Christians, they need to look out for Anne. This is for your dad and stepmom to work out with the camp staff.\n\nNot your kid, not your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA. It is not your job to take care of your stepsister. And also, what kind of religion do these people have if they strongly believe that your stepsister will be treated terribly in that religious camp? Is it not a religion with morals, caring for others, love, understanding, etc.?", "I'm kind of used to it now. I remember having to cancel plans before because my dad and Anne were going someplace and they were hiring a babysitter. They didn't trust the sitter to watch Anne's daughter so I had to cancel the plans I had established before my dad and Anne had theirs. Or the time my dad actually picked me up early from a friend's house because I needed to supervise Anne's daughter with kids.", "Anne was. She never let her daughter out of her side outside of school hours before she married dad. Then when she married him they decided to use me for it.", "There isn't another family member I could live with. My maternal grandparents are both in a nursing home and my dad's family would not support me in living with them. They're more on dad/Anne's side with this.", "16 year old.", "It's all about the Christian stuff for them, but mostly for Anne. She's super invested in making sure her daughter is as involved with Church stuff as she can be and this camp takes all ages of kids and teens. It would never be for me though.", "It's on the parents' shoulders to make sure their daughter with needs has the proper care. Shoving that onto their non-needs teenage daughter is NOT ok. She deserves a childhood as well and having to be forced to play carer/buddy of something they're not educated on (or even willing) is not the right way to deal with this situation. OP is 100% right to do what she did.", ">Your reluctance to be the big sister she needs   \n>  \n>is  \n>  \n> selfish. \n\nUmmmmmm...she's not being asked to be a big sister.  She's being asked to be a mother.  If you asked OP, I think she'd be entirely A-OK with playing the role of big sister.  But her family is trying to force her to fill an entirely different role.", "no. op does not have to take full responsibility, only the bare minimum IF the step mother talked to op first maybe op would have agreed to help a little bit.", "Step sister is NOT OPs problem. She's already wasted 8 years of her life being forced to be a third parent. If Stepsister cant handle being at camp by herself then she shouldn't go", "Never get used to it, you're being used as a second parent and that is not okay. If you can, talk to another family member or your school counselor. This sort of expected dependency will screw up your future come exam season and that is totally unacceptable", "That really sucks. I'm sorry.", "My family members I can talk to side with my dad and Anne on this. My school counselor is useless. She's never helped anyone at my school. I could technically tell my maternal grandma but she's in a nursing home and can't do anything. Grandpa had a stroke and never fully recovered so I couldn't tell him.", "Any maternal Cousins , aunt, uncle?\n\nAlso as the last resort you can report them to cps", "That's awful, I'm so sorry you're in this situation. Family members suffering with your father and stepmum about you being required as a proxy parent is beyond pathetic. When you reach adulthood, consider of got want any relationship at all with them."]}
