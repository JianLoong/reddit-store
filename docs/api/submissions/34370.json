My stepsister and I are both 16f. Even tho my dad has been married to her mom for 10 years, my stepsister and I don't really know each other.\n\nHer dad works for some big international company and she lived in Asia from when she was 3 until she was 9, then in Europe until she was 13, then lived in South America until September. Now they're in the US until the summer then they're going back to Asia.\n\nThey're staying a few minutes away from my dad and stepmom and she's been spending weekends with us. Now that she's actually here on weekends, my dad and stepmom put another bed in my room and said I have to share until they move again. \n\nShe goes to this 75k a year international school by my school and drives a brand new Tesla. I go to public school and take the bus. I told her she should drive me to school because her school is next to mine and the bus sucks. She said no. I told her to be a good sister and help me out and she said she's not my sister. \n\nSince she won't help me out and says she's not my sister, I won't be sharing a room with her. I left her stuff outside the room and took the spare keys so they couldn't let her in and I told her I'll share my room when she shares her car. Now her dad won't let her come here and says her mom has to go to their house to see her. They also might go back to Asia early because apparently the whole point of them staying here for a year was for her to get to know her mom (she visits for a couple weeks a year but it's different) and that's not going to happen if she doesn't have a room at the house. \n\nThey're saying they get why I did it but I need to deal with her until she goes back to Asia.

We\u2019re you suggesting she should come to your house every day for the privilege of staying in your room on weekends? How far out of her way would that be? Sounds pretty demanding.", "NTA. It is a big thing to lose your personal space and it does not sound as if you were asked before, but told. If people think you are rude for telling her to drive you, so is she for not being a gracious guest and helping you.", "ESH- she was going to find any excuse not to live there\u2019s but you definitely made it much easier for her by being rude. \n\nA car is a luxury vs a room is a necessity. If she didn\u2019t stay in your room where would she have gone? The living room or something. I\u2019m sure it was the last thing your parents wanted to do, but it needed to happen for her to be close to her mom.", "Gently, YTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask but rather demanded that she drive you to school essentially in exchange for staying in your room. When she said no (which frankly makes sense considering she doesn\u2019t stay with you on weekdays and would literally have to chauffeur you back and forth), you tried to pressure/manipulate her by once again TELLING (not asking) her with the \u201cbe a good sister\u201d comment. If I were her, I also would probably have responded similarly.\n\nYou didn\u2019t like it when your parents demanded you share your room with your stepsister. Do you see how she wouldn\u2019t like you demanding she chaffeur you around?\n\nYou seem to take issue with her driving a brand new Tesla, but you also want to be driven in it. And this leads me to my main point. \n\nYou sound really, really jealous of her. And you\u2019re taking your jealousy out on her.\n\nListen, I get it. I went to public school in an economically depressed area. I remember being a teenager and feeling self-conscious when I met people who went to super elite private schools and lived these jetsetting lives I couldn\u2019t even imagine.\n\nBut did you notice that the one constantly pointing out the disparity in wealth is you, not your stepsister? \n\nThis is a tough situation for everyone involved, and it sucks that the adults in your life didn\u2019t exactly set you up for success. But you need to understand that how you treat other people says a lot more about who you are as a person than your salary, your car, or your house ever will.", "If you had asked politely and were having any actual problems with taking the bus and/or she was really rude about saying no , I could maybe give you some grace, because you are a kid still after all.

Is this how you normally try to get people to do you favors? Does that kind of behavior generally work for you? \n\nIts not stepsisters fault you live in a 2 bedroom house and she needs an actual room. Its not stepsisters fault that your parents dont ask her to do any chores (and I wouldnt make a kid whos only around on weekends do very much either). Idk what everyone else is on calling her a spoiled brat for turning down a **demand**, not being asked to clean a house she barely exists in, and simply being rich. Your stepsister has done ZERO things wrong here from what you\u2019ve given us.\n\n\nYour parents are the ones that have actively made choices that make you miserable and jealous. Not your stepsister. All she\u2019s done is exist and refuse a demand. \n\nI am really sorry you have been made to feel this way. Giving up your space sucks. But honestly? Your parents have clearly been pretty damn soft on you too, or you wouldn\u2019t be acting like this. \n\n\nWould it have literally killed you to ask? Or at least be smart about getting what you want and bring it up with your parents and see if they couldn\u2019t make it happen?\n\nYTA. I do feel bad for you losing your space to someone who has so much, and having that in your face all the time. That does suck. But you are definitely the asshole. Everyone else voting otherwise is just blinded by your stepsisters obscene privilege and wealth and their hatred of rich people, because you haven\u2019t actually told us one damn thing she\u2019s actively done to you besides, and I cannot stress this enough, saying no to what Im 10000% was a rude demand to be your chauffeur to school", "YTA if you flat out told her she should drive you to school.\n\nThat's no asking. That's not being polite (you also used the \u201cwe\u2019re sisters\u201d  line only when it was convenient for you but obviously had no real sincerity since you can't handle a negative factor of being siblings like sharing a room). So, I could understand her response.\n\nAs an aside, It's weird how your parents are letting you run their house.\n\nThe only one who really gets a bad hand dealt here is your stepmom.\n\n\nIf you waited a few weeks and asked her, or brought it up with your stepmom, and had a conversation about it then I\u2019d say different.\n\nThe reality of it all is it\u2019s not your house and your parents can put your step-sister in your room if they want.\nIt's not abusive, it's not evil, it's just an inconvenience for a little while, and that's it.", "YTA. \nFirst off, you don't get to demand anything. You didn't even ask her nicely to drive you. You told her. \n\nSecond, the living room is not a proper sleeping arrangement for anyone. Sharing your room is temporary and only for a few days a week. \n\nThird, your stepmom rarely sees her daughter as it is, and you throwing this fit ruined the chance to see her more for the short time they're in the country. \nThis is extremely selfish of you. \n\nI have shared my room with a stranger as a teenager for a few months as well, yes it sucked. But it was temporary and for a good reason, and I knew that. So I pushed through and merely tried to set a few ground rules. Like clean tf up after yourself and don't bother me while I'm doing my homework and don't touch my stuff. \nI was happy it was over and knew I had done the right thing. \n\nFourth, she's not your sister indeed. You two have never been able to bond. Those connections take time and effort, but that doesn't mean you are justified being so horrible to her. She's not the brat here, you are.", "If she drove a Kia, would you make the same demand?", "YTA. I get having to share a room sucks, and it\u2019s a pain to share with someone you barely know, but you don\u2019t get to take out your frustrations on a girl who had less of a choice in this than you did. Boo hoo, her dad put her in private school and got her a fancy car while you live the same life as the average teenager. She\u2019s had her entire life uprooted and you\u2019re treating her like garbage and then throwing the \u201cwe\u2019re sisters\u201d card? No, honey. You want to get any form of input, talk to your dad and stepmom. You want a ride to school in that fancy car? Ask nicely and accept a no if that\u2019s her choice.\n\nYou are not entitled to her car, or to interfering with her time with her mother. This could have been a good chance to make a friend at LEAST, but you chose to act like a toddler and demand the new girl share her cool toy then threw a tantrum when she said no.", "YTA No sweat of her nose, the only person you're inconveniencing so your stepmother. Someone who barely knows you is not your Uber driver.", "[removed]", "Yta you went nuclear immediately.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t talk to your step mom to see if alternative room arrangements could be made.\n\nSo now your step mom doesn\u2019t get to know her own daughter because you\u2019re being spiteful.", "You're obviously TA don't let these comments fuel your selfishness", "I think I've said it before but people on this sub are really weird when it comes to room sharing, they act like it's a form of abuse.

Your parents have crappy communication with both of you. You see your sister's privilege but you forget you've got the bonus prize...you live with her mum. A woman she hardly knows. I would suggest you write your thoughts down, have a family meeting and see if you can come to some compromise. NTA for making the suggestion but the delivery could be better, asking always works better but you are only following from the example given to you by your parents.", "Girl, you're spoiled as hell. You didn't politely asked her and surely you don't give damn that she is your stepsister, you only said it cause you wanna use her.\nYour parents did a poor job raising you, smh, ESH", "YTA. You have transportation and Its perfectly fine. she\u2019s not your personal chauffeur.", "How does your stepmother treat you? Is she kind and supportive? If so, then YTA. The only person you are hurting is her. It is her house also. Why should your father get to have his daughter sleep in a bedroom and her daughter sleep on the couch. It is unfortunate that there are only two bedrooms, but that's the situation you are dealing with. Not sharing your room is selfish.", "YTA, you're not entitled to a free ride.", "INFO:\nHow far away in miles does she live? You say a few minutes, how far is it then?\n\nYou expected that she drives by, every morning on weekdays to pick you up and drive you to school, but she is only at your room on weekends. \nThat means she must drive everyday to your home.", "I'm going with ESH. You should have spoken to your parents and explained that you felt they took your space without any give or consultation but you should also understand your stepmum wants to get to see daughter. Your Dad and Stepmum are AH because they should have been the grown ups and spoken to you and controlled the situation better, both of you are 16, close to being adults, they should treat you as such. Your step-sis isnt really an AH, she could have been more gracious  but ultimately if she isn't there on school days she has to come and get you, even if close by that's a pain. Then giving a lift to someone you don't really know? That's a pain, car time for me is precious quiet time.\n\nI suspect there's a little bit of you that just wants to rock up to school in a tesla each day...", "ESH\n\nThe parents for not asking if you two want to share the room and for not guiding you through that situation. The way they handled it also sends the massage that you have no sayin that matter at all. It's completely understandable that they want to have your stepsister in their house though. There's a difference between \"sharing one roof\" and \"visiting for the day\" after all. It's not a logical difference, but an emotional one. \n\nYour sister for seemingly accepting the arrangement, but not doing anything in return even though you are inconvenienced by it. Also for that \"we are not family\" line. She lives a few minutes away, that's nothing. \n\nYou for not asking if she would drive you with the car and not talking it through with your stepsister and the parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people don't realize how much of an inconvenience it can be to share a room. Yes, a lot of kids have to share their rooms. That doesn't change anything. Different people, different circumstances. People are used what they are used to and a lot of people need their private space where they can have their peace and quiet.\n\nNot entitled to private space? Yes, maybe, but it can also affect the mental health of a person very strongly when their private space, that they are used to have, gets invaded without your permission, even if that person just stays for the weekend. The room got rearranged, extra bed, extra dresser. It doesn't feel like your own room anymore.", "All the yta comments can go to hell. HARD NTA , it is your room , no one asked you if you were okay with sharing. I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s your parents\u2019 house so they can do whatever they want , cuz privacy is the bare minimum you owe your kids when you decide to give birth to them. She doesn\u2019t have to drive you , but you don\u2019t gotta share either.", "NTA and frankly I am appalled by the amount of y t a.\nYou are being imposed to share your privacy with a stranger. Said stranger is living the rich life while you take the bus to go to public school. Taking you to school if said school if close doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want your povo ass to touch her tesla leather.\n\nIt sucks for your stepmum but I think her daughter was looking for a way to go back to her usual and you gave her one, that she took. Gladly.", "I feel bad for your stepmom here. She hardly gets to ever see her own daughter. I can understand why you're irritated with the current situation, but by just saying step sister can just stay at the dad's house is not taking into account the difficulty it's causing for your step mom. This whole situation is messed up and frankly sad.", "YTA\n\nYour bedroom at your dad's and her mother's house is not your personal property. They were entitled to ask you to share so she had somewhere to sleep.\n\nHer personal property is not your fad's - it's hers. \n\nYou sound desperately jealous and you have deprived your stepmother of precious time with her daughter.", "YTA.\n\nYou have no leverage here. It might be your room in name, but the house belongs do your dad and stepmom. \n\nShe owes you nothing, you owe her nothing.", "YTA. This is a major case of only child syndrome from your end. It\u2019s also super weird that your parents let you run the house like that. \n\nYou can\u2019t demand people to drive you around. Your stepsister is not your Uber driver. She doesn\u2019t live in the same house as you, or go to the same school.\n\nDo you think your stepsister wants to share a room with you? Nobody likes sharing bedrooms. However, it\u2019s literally two nights a week. If you stopped bossing everyone around, and made an effort to get along, it could have been tolerable (if not fun).\n\nThis whole situation is a lot more disruptive for your stepsister than it is for you. Private school and a Tesla do not make up for the fact that your stepsister has barely had any relationship with her mother for 10+ years. Now, to have a relationship with her mother, she\u2019s had to move countries, change schools, and share a bedroom with the child her mother has been raising. THEN, to make it worse, she\u2019s been kicked out of her mothers house, because she doesn\u2019t want to be your personal Uber driver.\n\nFocus on productive solutions, not bossing everyone around. Your behaviour is damaging your stepmother and stepsisters relationship, and the wider family dynamic.", "YTA.

She probably didn't want to actually share your room either. She would probably like her own room too.", "INFO - where else can she sleep in the house?", "I get how you feel but imagine how hard it would be to come and live with strangers and be told to share a room with one. It\u2019s just as hard for her. You could have talked to her and shared a bond over how shitty the situation was for both of you. Instead you chose to take out your frustration on her when she had no say in the situation just like you. You took your frustration out on the wrong person and you should consider apologising to her if you care at all about your step mother.", "NTA, though you ventured dangerously close, and if you don't decide and learn to do better, you WILL be an asshole. But your DAD.\n\nYour dad.\n\nYour dad needs a reality check. At this point in your life, if he doesn't like your interpersonal skills, he's got no one to blame but himself, and maybe your mum. \n\nAnger is a natural response to injustice. You handled your reasonable reaction to an unreasonable request poorly. Your communication skills are not, let's say, polished.\n\nThat's not your fault. \n\nYou do need to learn to get a grip on your Harley Davidson strength emotions. It's fine to have huge feelings; many great things begin there. Huge engines and feelings have power, which, when out of control, will be destructive.

Manage that shit, kid, or it'll destroy you from the inside.\n\nThat's your responsibility. \n\nIt does totally suck that you got saddled with an imposition in the guise of a spoiled teen girl. Her mum and your dad should compensate you in some way. Adults are compensated for being inconvenienced. This is like a mini-imminent domain. They require some of your real estate- and you deserve at least a token of their acknowledgment and appreciation of your contribution and cooperation. It's appalling, in fact, that they demanded you relinquish your personal space, to which you are accustomed, without so much as a by-your-leave, never mind checking in on your feelings and so on.

Now they're in the US until the summer then they're going back to Asia.\n\nThey're staying a few minutes away from my dad and stepmom and she's been spending weekends with us. Now that she's actually here on weekends, my dad and stepmom put another bed in my room and said I have to share until they move again. \n\nShe goes to this 75k a year international school by my school and drives a brand new Tesla. I go to public school and take the bus. I told her she should drive me to school because her school is next to mine and the bus sucks. She said no. I told her to be a good sister and help me out and she said she's not my sister. \n\nSince she won't help me out and says she's not my sister, I won't be sharing a room with her. I left her stuff outside the room and took the spare keys so they couldn't let her in and I told her I'll share my room when she shares her car. Now her dad won't let her come here and says her mom has to go to their house to see her. They also might go back to Asia early because apparently the whole point of them staying here for a year was for her to get to know her mom (she visits for a couple weeks a year but it's different) and that's not going to happen if she doesn't have a room at the house. \n\nThey're saying they get why I did it but I need to deal with her until she goes back to Asia.

It would be one thing if your house is literally on her way and your school is truly right by her school.  But the most likely scenario is that picking you up and driving you home every day is a huge, time wasting inconvenience.  Please understand that expecting her to do this is a lot.

I understand you being envious that your stepsister's financial situation is better than your family's. This is not your step sister's fault. My first year of college in a dormitory I was assigned a roommate I didn't know and had a little in common with. We dealt with it. If your family can't afford a place with an extra bedroom, I don't think it's wrong of your parents to ask you to share your bedroom, especially since it's most likely going to be short-term.

Therefore having someone shipped into your previously personal space at this age is a lot more of a thing than at 8yo or if you were asked to facilitate this change your mid twenties for example.

Besides, it's literally only on weekends and for the last 10 years you've hardly had to deal with or interact with her at all, sharing the room on weekends really isn't a big deal you make it out to be- you haven't actually done her any favors (since it wasn't your choice) and she doesn't owe you anything. Also, the Tesla wasn't paid for by your dad or her mom, so they can't make her share it (besides it's probably illegal for her to drive another underage person without an adult in the car). Why should she have to leave extra early 5 days a week so she has enough time to pick you up and drop you off at your school first when she barely even knows you and is already forced to spend weekends sharing a room with you?

You set the \"sister\" tone in an entitled way which makes her response to you justifyable. 2nd, you are not doing her a favor by sharing your room. She has her own space at her father's home that she is probably more than comfortable staying at full time.

However, your stepmom and father are the ones that would owe the favor or compensation to you for your sacrifice. Not her. This should've been a discussion because even though I'm the type where if you don't pay bills you don't get a say, this is still an extreme for you. Unsure of the dynamic between stepmom and her ex, but it would appear that ex stated he is okay with daughter staying weekends, but only if she has an active place to sleep. He set a standard for his daughter that he wants for her and Im not mad at that. Those were the conditions and unfortunately your parents made you take the sacrifice. This was in fact unfair to you. That I do understand. But my statement still stands as YTA for 1, how you somewhat \"demanded\" and how you misdirected the request for a  favor or compensation rather.

She doesn't really show how it's beneficial to her stepsister.\n\nOP's selfish and immature, easily. It can still make her an asshole for the way she demanded a ride. Had she been nicer, she might have gotten somewhere. Sure, the situation sucks, but it ALSO sucks for the stepsister. Stepsister may get nice things but she's lost years of getting to know her mom, and now she'll lose even more time with her mom. I know it's not on OP at all, but it just goes to show that neither sister are really winning anything, at the end of this.", "I don\u2019t disagree that OP handled this about as poorly as you\u2019d expect a 16 year old girl to, but literally nobody else thought about her up to this point, so she\u2019s just getting stuffed from all angles. You\u2019d think the step sister could have made an ATTEMPT to at least be friendly or appreciative while imposing on OP. Being rude and dismissive is a slap in the face.", "I mean, stepsister isn't a \"immediate\" family. OP didn't even knew this girl before that. Stepmom have bigger problema because she hasn't been a parent for a decade. She is Just a visit. Nothing about this is OP problem or fault. Also you are forgeting that stepsis is also \"spoiled\" and refused a small favor for someone who had her life invaded by this Stranger. She could Just be a Nice person and give a ride. This situation is her fault Just as it's OP's.", "And none of that is the sisters fault", "You need to sleep on the couch! It's also her mother's house stop being an entitled little girl", "Yeah it is just impossible for this bazillionaire family to just put the other daughter in a 5 star hotel somewhere nearby so she can \"get to know her mum\" hahahah", "I think you\u2019re missing my point. I\u2019d focus more on your entitlement to \u201cyour\u201d house/room.", "I agree with you, but for stepsister to be rude to her and tell her she doesn\u2019t care about her while imposing is\u2026 a slap in the face. Somebody else commented that stepsister is rich and used to a high standard of living and is probably also u happy about having to share a room with a side bed with anybody. The parents are the ones really at fault here, they carelessly set this up to fail.", "Dad could sleep on the couch", "At the age of 16, no less.", "Good point - I think everyone is a bit of an AH in this situation.\n\nParents for not letting her know about sharing her room ahead of time, very irresponsible. \n\nStepsister for saying they\u2019re not family, super hurtful and rude.\n\nOP for the tantrum after the fact stepsister said no to driving her/ family comment.\n\nHonestly I feel like the biggest person at fault is the dad, he needed to communicate with his daughter. And the only person who is really losing is the stepmom. This situation can affect not only her relationship with her daughter but with her husband as well. I think they can still talk things out and the parents can address the family comment and the kicking out of room situation - both girls are in the wrong.", "Not only that, but \u201cright next to\u201d could also mean widely different things.\n\nThe town I grew up in, the middle and high schools were technically right next to each other\u2026 but to get from the middle school drop-off, to the high school\u2019s student lot, you had a stop sign and 2 sets of traffic lights to get through; not to mention, the pedestrian and bus traffic if you didn\u2019t time it right.", "A lot of people on reddit seem to think just up and buying a house with a whole extra bedroom is an immediate possibility. I consider myself privileged but when I was growing up I knew the difference between cruel, calculated decisions and temporary ones that were the best option available at the time.", "As someone who isn't a morning person. That 10 minutes can feel like a hour.", "She also does not have to comply. Have you ever been around teenagers? Like at all?", "We don't know that they didn't and the OP refused.  What we know is they put the bed in her room while she was at school and they didn't even get her permission.  The far more likely scenario is they told her, she refused, they fought, she didn't back down... and the parents decided it would be easier to just do it when she wasn't around to interfere.", "hahahahaha... they have a term for that fallacious argument... appeal to extremes or reductio absurdum.\n\nIf you're imagining uncle greg sleeping with a teenager it might be you that has the problem\ud83e\udd23", "My dude! I know, I hate mornings having to leave nearly 30 minutes early, because who knows how long ENTITLED OP will take to get ready, just to go to school, no thnx.", "is it though?  OP knows nothing about the new roomate.  It can be very triggering for many people to share a room with strangers unexpectedly.", "In another post she says her stepsister\u2019s place is 10 minutes away from her own home. That\u2019s adding at least 20 minutes round-trip every day, not to mention we don\u2019t know anything about the start/end times for the respective schools, extracurricular activities, etc.", "And also potentially increasing the travel time from the second house to the schools if the stepsister is currently staying closer etc. \n\nI don't agree with her being made to share her room with no discussion, but I think this is a bit of an unreasonable ask, particularly as I'm sure the stepsister would also prefer not to be sharing a room.", "Cut the kid a break. While she was at school her parents went in her room and changed things around for her peach of a step sis, without a heads up.\n\nAnyway, she said no because they \"aren't sisters\". Doesn't seem like she would have yes under any circumstance.", "Lets also keep in mind that English might not be OP's first language and the meaning of \"telling\" could have been more conversational in person."]}
