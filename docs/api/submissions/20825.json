But everything leading up to the wedding, even the bridal shower, having pretty specific dress codes just sounds exhausting. Basic rules like \"don't overshadow the bride\" is fine but saying no to jeans at what is meant to be a casual party seems a bit much. \n\nI think the real issue is you just hate the shirt. Just tell your mom that, but first find some good alternatives that you would like that still say mother of the bride and pick one out together.", "> The photographer will be there to take getting ready pictures and I would like pictures on the morning of just me and her getting everyone\u2019s coffee orders.\n\nYou want people to have a dress code for the getting ready pictures? Do they have to get ready to get ready? And if so, do you want pictures of the getting ready for the getting ready pictures? I kinda think YTA for this.

Enforcing weird convoluted dress codes for everything is stupid. In the end, the only one who will look weird/stick out is your mom, which isn't on you.

Most reasonable people know this and just suck it up.", "Nta the world revolves around you after all", "Soft YTA. You know your mom isn't comfortable in dressy attire and you are trying to force her to overdress for MULTIPLE events - not just the wedding? Obviously don't wear the t-shirt to the wedding, but surely you could allow her to wear the shirt she is obviously super proud of to one event. Why not find a compromise? Your post said \"showers\" plural. No idea why there are multiple showers, but she can't wear the shirt to at least one of them? Maybe the compromise is that she wears a flowy maxi or midi skirt, her MOB tee, and a little cardigan.\n\nEdit to add: As a former wedding photographer, I just want to say that yes, the photos are important, but not at the expense of your family. Wedding should be a celebration with everyone. Things often don't go according to plan. I'm a little worried that you being this upset about what mom wears to events that aren't even the wedding itself, could be a bad sign for how stressful it will be on you if something bigger doesn't go according to plan. Maybe consider reframing your perspective on what is most important for your celebration. <3", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding, and you have the right to establish a dress code for your events. It seems like you've put a lot of thought into making sure everyone looks presentable and coordinated. While it's understandable that your mom may have wanted to wear a mother-of-the-bride shirt, it's also reasonable for you to want her to adhere to the dress code you've set.\n\nYou approached the situation by reminding her of the dress code and explaining why it's important to you. It's not like you simply told her what to wear without any context. Moreover, you even considered the potential embarrassment that could arise from having pictures of her in an outfit that doesn't align with the overall aesthetic.\n\nIt's essential to have a conversation with your mom about your expectations for the wedding and the significance of adhering to the dress code. Find a compromise that respects both of your perspectives. Ultimately, it's your special day, and you should feel comfortable and happy with how everything looks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she still facetimes and you pick out something nice for her and she wears it then again, where is the problem?", "Idk about anyone else but it is my most treasured picture with my mom and they are my favorite photos to look back at.", "They aren\u2019t pajamas in the sense they slept in them. It\u2019s something that can be buttoned off so they wont mess up their hair/makeup getting it off. It\u2019s like the robes most brides/bridesmaids wear but I asked my bridesmaids and all of them said they would rather have a nice set of pajamas so we\u2019re going with that than robes.", "Still, a very intimate, casual event. Years from now you would look at those pictures and smile. \"There's my Mom. Always doing her own thing.\"\n\nJust make sure you help her pick something nice for the wedding. That is where it matters!", "$20 says it\u2019s going to be something like this. \u201cThere\u2019s my mom and the photo she won\u2019t let me post because she hates what she\u2019s wearing.\u201d\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t even want me to post the picture of when I got engaged because she hates what she\u2019s wearing (i.e. it was a family Christmas and I was in a dress and she was in a Grinch shirt)", "I'm honestly can't say if you are or not the AH. But you know your mom and she doesn't know what to wear or pick out appropriately. Yes she's an adult but it's something she doesn't quite get. Kind of like I know what I want my yard to look like but I wouldn't know how to put it together.\n\nYour mom is the same way with clothes. You are going to have to take the time to work with her in what she needs to wear. Either take control totally or give her choices. She's not going to wake up over night and just \"get it\".", "You are going to criticize your mother but you dare to wear white ?", "Same here. Like I don\u2019t really get floral arrangements but my MIL does so she\u2019s handling that. Same thing with table settings. My grandma would host dinner parties so she\u2019s helping me with that. It\u2019s not a control thing. It\u2019s not even a \u201cperfect\u201d thing. I just want to have pictures with my mom with both of us looking nice. We haven\u2019t had a picture like this together in over 5 years.", "Well you've clearly warned her. So I don't see what the problem is. She can make the decision by herself.", "I was specifically talking about the morning-of-wedding getting ready time.  (Though I wasn\u2019t clear on that) I agree that regardless of personal style that a tshirt isn\u2019t cocktail attire but getting her hair done isn\u2019t a dress code event.", "Then you will need to take the bull by the horns, so to speak and pick out her outfit. You have to think what will be the bigger headache, having to pick out the outfits for all that is going on or having your mom in the those clothes not dressed for the occasion.", "Not really. We are middle class. We\u2019re comfy through the year, stressed around holidays. We manage. I\u2019m not asking for designer, just wearing something from Belk. Literally I got my bridal shower dress on Amazon for like $30 and I plan on wearing it twice.", "NTA. It seems like every wedding I have been to in the last five years, the clothes of Mother of Bride and groom have been arranged and coordinated. \nI know this \u2014 2 nephews, 1 cousin & 1 niece.", "ESH\nYou need to stop letting your mom put this on you. She is an adult capable of knowing if an event is tshirt and jeans or dress pants and top or a nice dress. You can give an opinion on her choices if she asks but you shouldn\u2019t have to pick out her every outfit for her.\n\nYou can remind her that there are dress codes for some event locations. If she shows up in the wrong attire she can deal with it. \nYou can remind her that photos will be taken at these events and posted.  She does not have to be photographed. If she wants to be in photos and later doesn\u2019t like how she is dressed in photos then remind her that it is not going to be your problem.  Tell her you won\u2019t take down photos posted later and she\u2019ll just have to deal with it.\n\nLet your mom wear her cheap shirt the morning of the wedding before everyone changes to the pajamas for the faked getting ready pictures. She can change before the photos. Or not change and just look how she looks.", "This. Your only rule for someone elses attire at your wedding should be no wedding dress besides the brides and whatever you wear, be prepared to see in pictures for years to come. Otherwise, I am personally very against the idea of aesthetics for the wedding trumping someone elses comfort. Its a special day to celebrate love, not a theater production", "?", "Common and trendy things are sometimes still bizarre and assholeish. The best pictures are the candid pictures, any photographer worth their salt will tell you that.", "Agreed for just getting her hair done. But it\u2019s what she\u2019ll be wearing for the photos of us \u201cfake getting ready\u201d like the last 30-45 minutes before we get into our actual dresses.", "If she does ask you to take it down or something, replace it by putting a really shitty clip art shirt over her in the photo", "I am like your mom in that I don't dress up.  I Ama jeans and tee shirt gal.\n\nEven I understand that I HAVE to dress for various formal occasions.  I have a few things, and I often ask my daughter to help.\n\nI would definitely listen an pre approve anything and everything with my daughter because I am so clueless.\n\nNTA"]}
