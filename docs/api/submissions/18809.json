I\u2019ve been unable to find work, I\u2019m barely pulling together my rent, I\u2019ve been seeing a resurgence of my depression. I\u2019m fighting tooth and nail to keep going. The other night was karaoke night and my friends, myself and my niece/old roommate who we will call D (23F) were there.\n\nEarlier this week I had found a set of Disneyland ears a very close friend got me when we went; they are Disney Princess ears and he literally got them \u201cto remind me I am always a princess.\u201d They were in my car when I parked at karaoke and decided I really needed the reminder. I decided to wear them. D saw my ears and was immediately annoyed. She asked why I was wearing *that*. I told the truth, that I just needed to feel good for a night, and all of our group saw that it made me happy and thought it was a fun thing. D was not at all cool with it. Whenever other regulars made comments about my princess ears, D would cut in and say SHE would be wearing hers but they were packed for a move. Then our friend who is the KJ called me up as \u201cPrincess [Name]\u201d and D lost her mind. She was angry and accused me of being an attention wh*re, that I wasn\u2019t and never would be a princess, that I was being completely rude to her. \n\nThis is where I might be the AH: I told her that if me just wearing Disney ears with a princess theme bothered her, she was giving off straight evil step sister vibes. Her BF asked if maybe she could wear them for a song and I said not a chance in hell, she\u2019s not a princess tonight and I didn\u2019t really trust her to give them back. They are very important to me, the friend that got them for me is my literal best friend and we won\u2019t ever get to go to Disneyland again together.\n\nMost of my friends think I wasn\u2019t overly mean, but some think I should have worn the ears for a song and put them back in my car. So AITA?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n\nSome context I didn\u2019t think to include: She\u2019s an only child and has rubbed our group the wrong way for a year being entitled. Most gave up trying to say things to her about it unless it\u2019s necessary. She\u2019s the youngest in our group and we all figured she\u2019d grow out of this behavior.", "created_utc": 1685730212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ykfj0/aita_for_deciding_to_be_a_princess_for_an_evening/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
