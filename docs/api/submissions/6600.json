My grandmother used to wash the clothes of 10 people so that she would have a place to live in the back of a house and from time to time she would have help to have something to eat. From being bent over so much, she has back problems until today with unbearable pain. \n\n2. She was never able to work, because when my youngest uncle was more independent, she had so many mental and physical health problems that nobody wanted to hire her. So she has a minimum wage pension that barely covers something. \n\n3.

You were more respectful than your grandfather deserved. If he had managed to accumulate any wisdom in his seventy years then he would know that respect must be earned.

I also had a fractured relationship with my grandfather before he passed away because he was abusive to my grandma and father. \n\nYour grandfather is a grown man and he chose to ruin your family the way that he did. You should be allowed to set this boundary with him if you're forced to be around him. It's very sad that your mother still wants a relationship with him, but she probably isn't looking at the situation clearly because of the trauma he caused by abandoning her. To her, she's probably desperately trying to build a relationship with an absent father she's wanted to care about her since she was a small child.\n\nBut you are the next generation of your family and it's up to you not to continue the toxic situation your family has. I generally believe in respecting elders but this man ruined your grandmother's life. You shouldn't have to treat him with respect if he hasn't earned it. You're a young adult and this is the time for you to be setting boundaries with your family.", "NTA. Respect is earned.", "That whole \"respect your elders\" thing is total BS anyway. Why do you deserve my respect just cause you're still alive?  Not dying is not a feat worthy of respect. \n\nMy stance on it is \"there are a LOT of other things I could call you instead of your name, but I don't think you would prefer any of those\". I have a similar issue with an aunt who melts down when I call her by her name and how she would never \"let her children\" call their aunts and uncles by their first names. Woman, we are all 40+, what do you think you're gonna do about it?"]}
