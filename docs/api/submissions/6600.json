It's not just penis vs vagina, but also XY vs XX chromosomes, facial hair vs a lack of, chest vs breast, strong vs less strong, deep voice vs light voice, aggressive vs nurturing, and so on. Of course, other than the chromosomes, if you're missing one it doesn't it doesn't mean you're any less of your gender, but if you don't have most of them it may."]}
