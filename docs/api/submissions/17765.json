The oldest two kids have moved out now, and it's just the youngest who still lives at home.\n\nWe have a four bedroom that's in a more rural area, which is a big empty house for just us and our son. The plan is to downsize, sell the house and move to some small place in the city. We hope to travel a lot, so we don't need a huge place. We've decided to sell the house in a few months.\n\nOur son isn't happy about that, even less so when he couldn't convince us to take him with us. He says it's unfair that his siblings got to live at home until after college, and he has to leave now. We offered to pay first last and security on any place he finds, but he thinks a few months notice wasn't enough to give him time to move and look for a job.\n\nI reminded him that he was lucky to have a good childhood with plenty of luxury, and that even paying to get him settled is a kindness. He accused us of prioritizing our retirement over his wellbeing, and said that we're lucky to be able to retire at all. He took it even further, and got his siblings involved.\n\nThey supported him to my surprise. They think we should either be fair and wait another couple years, or take him with us. When we didn't back down, our daughter said he could fly over to her house to stay there, despite sharing a one bedroom with her partner and our granddaughter.\n\nI think it's insane that they expect us to put our lives on hold for years just to allow him to live with us. But none of the kids have been talking to us much, so I guess their united against us.

What first career is he going into that can actually support him without a degree or apprenticeship that will allow him to support himself and build a life? \n\nMaybe you didn\u2019t think about this with the older two because you were not going anywhere- but most kids these days are not able to fully leave home and be completely financially self-sufficient until 23-25. Right now the cost of housing is way too high compared to starting salaries for anyone, let alone someone without a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nSo yeah- you are prioritizing your retirement over your youngest child\u2019s wellbeing and capacity to successfully launch into adulthood.

Are you never planning on having your children visit/stay with you? Why can't he just move in as well?

If your goal was retirement why have kids?", "YTA\n\nFor goodness sake just wait until your son has finished university. You most certainly are being unfair to him.

Because it\u2019s INSANELY expensive in todays economy to be able to afford living on your own. Your generation acts like a part time job is enough to support himself. \n\nWhen I was in college, I worked 60 hour weeks on top of school full time. Each job was above min wage. I could afford rent with 3 roommates, groceries (shopping at Aldi or other discount stores), and books every semester. I could sometimes throw maaaaaaybe a quarter worth of tuition in the pot, if I really budgeted and didn\u2019t do any extra activities (going out to eat ever, going to a movie, going to any events, buying coffee, etc). Everything else was loans.\n\nYou helped your other two children as long as they needed it - and it seems the 22 y/o could still need it as again, he has roommates. But you\u2019re ready to say see ya kid to the 19 y/o?? Absolutely a terrible parent.\n\nI can tell you this: my dad pulled all support my junior year of college - that is why I had to work 60 hours a week. I explained this to him, and he told me it was time to \u201clive his life\u201d as you say too. We do not speak. He will not walk me down the aisle at my wedding because he abandoned me at a time I needed support. You will find the same fate if you do this.

I cannot fathom being 19 years old and having my own parents pull the stability in my life right out from under me.", "Yup, unless they're millionaires, they'll run out of savings. They've got 30-40 years of life left", "They were probably absent if they worked like crazy their entire careers. Plus, they are 45... In 5 years they'll be killing eachother due to boredom", "My daughter is welcome forever at my home. Her and my wife are the 2 most important people in my life. I want her to know that I would do anything within my power to help her met her goals in life. Her success is my success. I couldn\u2019t fathom kicking her out. These 2 shouldn\u2019t have had kids, they sound extremely selfish.", "Shady Pines, Ma!", "I'm also 45 and still figuring out what I wanted to be when I grow up \ud83d\ude04.", "My mom gives my sister shit because her oldest son \"still\" lives at home.  Obviously my sister is a rotten parent because her son hasn't moved out yet.\n\nHe's **21**.  *AND* my mom also lives with my sister, so...y'know....if my sister feels like taking mom's advice and \"pushing someone out of the nest\" I have a great idea as to who she should stat with...", "Or at least that they *think* that they do. OP better hope that they're right and karma doesn't decide to bite them in the ass when their kids have lives they don't want to \"put on hold\" to bail out mom and dad.", "I like the story, but I'm also laughing. I have so many hobbies and my time off is always filled up. Why do you need to go on expensive vacations with friends, you can't just plan a local dinner and spend the day reading or learning a new skill?\n\nI'm a work-a-holic and love my job(s) but I also have a life outside of work and if I could afford to retire now, I would have way too many things keeping me busy to ever be bored even without hanging out with people!", "I realized the other day that if we paid off our mortgage completely we would still have to pay $800 a month just for taxes and homeowners insurance. How the hell do people retire anymore?", "Ya,  my kids are my life.  I love having them around and dread the day I don't.", "You kind of have to TRY to find a one-bedroom condo. Why not just buy the 2 for visitors??  So selfish.", "Retiring at 45 when their first child was born when he was 20 - 95% likely that they had heavy family support and/or money as a late teen/early 20 year old.", "I'm sorry she failed to be the mother you needed, and deserve to have.  \nThis internet stranger is proud of you. I hope you are doing better now, and that you continue to be able to heal and flourish.", "I'm assuming they've had some excellent examples of knowing wrong from right, given this post in general.", "\\*dumping it on the street", "And they\u2019re shocked their daughter would offer her very limited space to her brother.\n\nI wonder if this is the black sheep kid, and the parents don\u2019t feel he should have the same opportunities as his siblings if it gets in the way of the parents early retirement and life of jetsetting.", "I tried to foster a dog recently and it was an absolute shit show. Horrible rescue.\n\nI want to try again some day, but I'm currently busy trying to find ways to help my former foster dog out of the horrible situation they put her in.", "Oh you will be just fine! My parents had my sister and me in their 40s and they said it was what kept them young.", "I gave birth when I was 33, and my SO was 39, just about to turn 40 :) \nYou're not too old !\n\nAnd to be honest, I'm happy I am in my mid thirties as I feel I am a better mom than I would've been in my 20s.\n\n(Not saying older parents are better, just speaking for myself)", "My parents were 35 & 39 when they had me, my sister is 5.5 years younger than me. I need to thank them more directly for making the very wise decision to wait. I saw a lot of my friends with younger parents dealing with a lot of BS & immaturity from their parents because they rushed into having kids, on that \"climb the ladder, check the boxes, do the things society says you should do\" power trip. \n\nYou're gucci to have kids now, or within the next few years, if that truly feels like the right thing to do. But it's a slog and a grind and a lot of days not a cake walk in the slightest. Be sure you're ready to turn your life upside down for the rest of your life if you wanna bring another human onto this earth.", "We also have a 25 year old at home. Our 32 year old daughter didn\u2019t move out until she was 29, and it was with her boyfriend. There is no way she could have done it herself. I\u2019ve told all 3 of my kids on multiple occasions that they could live with us forever. My husband agrees. This is not the same world as when we were 19. I moved out at 18 and got along fine. Not the case any longer.", "Aw, thank you so much! That's really nice to hear sincerely.\n\nAlmost 14 months sober, ran my first half marathon two weeks ago, and doing two more next month. I'm pretty much killing it!", "One hell of a speedrun. Most people are 60+ before they manage to alienate all three of their adult children. Overachievers lol\n\nDefinitely YTA. I don\u2019t trust anyone who can afford to retire at 45, and this is why. I fully believe the type of ruthless person that can accomplish that without winning the lottery or coming into money, is not suited for a family. Not a real family anyway.", "Congrats! My mom had me when she was 39, and I'm 22 now. I think my parents being settled in life is one of the main reasons I had a good childhood.", "The couple in this post could probably have a second round if they wanted to.", "My daughter (28), her husband (28) and our grandchildren have lived with us the last 4 years. She moved out with a former fiance and moved back when that didn't work out. She got pregnant and they got married 4 years ago and we have helped them have the opportunity to save and get their lives on track before taking on paying rent in this economy. They are moving out next month and I'm so happy for them, but devastated that I will no longer have the same relationship with her family. Being there to help out the kids to bed and then have time to talk with her and her husband as adults had made us extremely close and I'm going to miss them so much....even though they will be less than 15 minutes away and I will still have the kids after school until they get off work.", "Hey fellow sober stranger! Congratulations on 14 months, that\u2019s amazing! My five years is coming up in nine days, and I can feel that same happiness of sobriety now as I did my first week. One day at a time!", "Not that they should. They\u2019re complete assholes.", "Fuck yeah - five years is incredible! Anything fun planned? I'm not doing anniversaries per se, but my need of running shoes happens to coincide with every six months of my sober date, so I've been enjoying picking out new fun ones lol. \n\nIt really is a totally different world. I can't believe how much better my life is.", "Honestly, the job is never done. You always have some manner of responsibility towards your kids, even if the nature of that responsibility changes over time.", "the job is never done. my 98 year old great grandmother is still a loving mother to my grandma.", "I\u2019m 43 and my parents still parent me at times.", "Some people should not be parents", "They don't care if the kid is fully prepared, just that their legal responsibility is over.  If '18' wasn't coded into law, a lot of parents would throw out their kids much sooner.", "Doesn't even matter if it's hard--he can't do them at all if he has nowhere to live, and no one can afford to rent *anywhere* with just a part-time job in 2023.", "They can afford it just fine, they just don\u2019t want to.", "I got kicked out at 19, and it's only in the last few years (I'm now 35) that my husband and I have gotten both of our finances under control and in an upward trajectory.", "Yeah, I find it weird there\u2019s no mention of his plans after high school. Not saying anybody HAS to go to college/learn a trade or anything\u2026But being forced immediately out of HS to join the workforce and start supporting yourself really leaves no room to advance in any other way. \nIt\u2019s putting him at such a huge disadvantage and pretty much ensuring his 20\u2019s will be incredibly difficult and unfulfilling. \nGreat job parents, YTA \n\nAlso, apparently they\u2019re so financially intelligent that they can retire early, but can\u2019t seem to grasp the fact that an average 19 year old is in no way capable of affording rent these days?", "Plus, as OP even said, they don't plan to be home a lot, so there's no reason their child would be an inconvenience in a 2 bedroom.", "But OP is willing to pay first and last month's rent! That will solve *everything!* /s", "Even $15/hr wouldn\u2019t help much! They\u2019d have to make $25/hr to have $2,000 be 1/3 of their salary, which is kind of a rule of thumb.", "Even looking at this as a transaction makes it look foolish. \n\nIf OP is really this deadset on seeing his relationship with his 19 year old as a transaction, he's missing out on his part - the kids actively helping their parents in their sunset years.", "My mom used to scream at me because she had to drive me to school, appointments, etc. Like?? I didn\u2019t ask to be here. Why did you decide to be a parent?", "OP, you and your wife are retiring at 45!?!  What, do you have like $4M saved up!?!  Bullshit, or at the very least, rich people problems . . .", "I am 51, I joined the military at 17 and went to boot camp a week after graduating high school. I got out, got a part time job and went to college for a while. That was a long time ago though. I also left home because I hated living at home at the time.\n\nMy wife and I had our son when we were in our 30\u2019s, he turns 14 this September and I am like \u201cshit time flew I cannot imagine him moving out on his own right at 18\u201d.  We already planned on him living at home and going to a local college or a trade school, whatever as long as he\u2019s getting ready to be able to take care of himself and start a career. \n\nThe thing is we don\u2019t plan on him living at home until he\u2019s in his 30\u2019s but we also don\u2019t plan on giving him 90 days notice and telling him \u201cwhelp it\u2019s been fun here\u2019s your 90 day eviction notice\u201d.", "This guy just needed to take up gaming. Problem solved!\n\nI don't doubt some people regret selling their businesses or retiring early, but they've probably made their job a big part of their identity over forging outside interests. I think most people, if they have the means and health, could fill their days if money wasn't a big issue.", "There are so many tax cuts and credits for children/school/childcare/etc that the childfree people are definitely paying more in taxes at the end of the day lol. Not to mention that the dual income, no kids crowd usually have a ton of savings by the time they retire (wasn't the estimate like half a million dollars per kid for parents?) and won't be using government programs.\n\nThese people are probably also the \"but who will take care of you when you're older?!?!\" crowd. The ones that usually end up alone in a cheap retirement home because their kids have their own kids/lives/etc and don't have time to care for them. That is, if they haven't been cut off entirely. Meanwhile, the childfree people have enough savings to pay someone to care.", "Exactly. I enjoy my life with my kids, because of my kids, not despite them. If that\u2019s someone\u2019s plan, than maybe kids are not their thing, wich is fine. After the baby stage, you can live a very adventurous life with kids, if you choose to do so. But to each their own.", "Both things can be true. You deserve the pride but you absolutely didn\u2019t deserve the struggle.", "My 17th bday present was a plane ticket from NY to TX to live with my boyfriend of 6 months lol. \"That's what you wanted\". Thanks Ma.", "My friends were all mid to late 20's when they moved out. They have substantial nest eggs, no debt (some had loans but lived with parents and paid them off), will be buying or have bought houses. \n\nI am proud of where I am at 35 - retirement savings are okay, I have 25K in an emergency fund, etc, pretty decent career for myself. But you're setting up your kids for long term success and happiness by letting them walk out the door prepared. Not to mention the health benefits of avoiding paycheck to paycheck stress for half a decade or longer. \n\nI don't understand the thought process behind throwing your kids into the capitalistic meat grinder as soon as you can. Theres this very American ideal that suffering is somehow character building or proves who.you are or makes you a better person. And it's just not true. Struggling in and of itself isn't some attribute to aspire too. My friends are amazing, kind, grateful, generous, hard-working people and their parents didn't have to manufacture adversity to make them so. \n\nLife is/will be hard enough. There's no need to create obstacles. I promise they will be there!", "I worked in elder care for several years.  I can't tell you how many people die and there is no one there for them.  Their kids hate them for they way they treated them growing up.\n\nThey die in a smelly crowded nursing facility.  No one coming to see them.  Some stranger, usually non-english speaking, change their full diapers, when they get around to it.  The food is typically disgustingly horrible.\n\nWhat's left of their belongings, usually some clothes and maybe a few pictures, ends up in a cardboard box and picked up or dropped off to the salvation army.  \n\nThere's a long list of regrets that people like this mutter in their dying days.  The lesson I've heard over and over is that it's not what you owned or the cool trips you went on that you take with you.  It's the love you created.  Who and how well you loved them.  \n\nI suspect these two will figure it out when it's already too late.", "Ya I wouldn't expect the kids to put their lives on hold to help take care of their parents, but they might be very generous and help them find a nursing home to move into. I wouldn't count on it though.", "You too? For my 16th birthday, I got towels and dishes to use when I moved out in addition to the suitcases at graduation. Yay us!", "Well, the kids have had a wonderful example of who *not* to become.", "Yeah. Figure for every $1 increase in rent you need to be making an extra $3 in income.  The new price requires you to make well over double the income.", "Having kids is a weird speed run strategy for that game.", "You\u2019re not too old!  I have many friends your age starting families.  Wishing you all the best \u2764\ufe0f", "We had our kids at 40. While I wouldn\u2019t recommend waiting much longer than that, it\u2019s still very doable for you, and I don\u2019t feel like Grandpa Dad\u2026", "I had my first this past October. I was 37 when I got pregnant, 38 when he was born. My husband is 35. I'm glad we didn't do this any younger, I'm the best version of myself I have ever been and I'm glad I saved that for our baby.\n\nI will say though, it wasn't entirely voluntary as we started trying when I turned 30.", "Why are they even selling the house? They can rent it after the son moves out, and then the kids can inherit it and have a stable source of income. But no, they want to blow all the money now, to hell with future generations", "Yup. I live in the outskirts of a metro area in CA. Husband and I bought our condo in the late 1990s. Value has quadrupled since then. We got priced out of our area a long time ago. We\u2019re still here because we\u2019d have to move out to the boonies to afford something else.", "And speaking as a child of older parents, my parents had myself and then my brother at 38&41 years. It\u2019s different, but if it\u2019s what you want, please don\u2019t give up!", "All that plus money doesn't go as far as it used to. Pre-pandemic, $200 a month for groceries for myself was living like a queen with the fancy shampoo and good cereal. Now, $50 is maybe 4 meals for one person, if planned well and the rest of the week is meatless meals.", "I\u2019m 56 with a 21 year old and an 18 year old. I\u2019d like to imagine I\u2019m not too old or out of touch.  :)", "That sounds like a dream to me. No grandkids yet but I will be just like you!", "In 1998, husband and I were managing comfortably on 35k per year with one kid. I can\u2019t imagine trying that today. The only reason we\u2019re managing now is because we have artificially low housing costs for our area."]}
