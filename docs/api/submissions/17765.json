The oldest two kids have moved out now, and it's just the youngest who still lives at home.\n\nWe have a four bedroom that's in a more rural area, which is a big empty house for just us and our son. The plan is to downsize, sell the house and move to some small place in the city. We hope to travel a lot, so we don't need a huge place. We've decided to sell the house in a few months.\n\nOur son isn't happy about that, even less so when he couldn't convince us to take him with us. He says it's unfair that his siblings got to live at home until after college, and he has to leave now. We offered to pay first last and security on any place he finds, but he thinks a few months notice wasn't enough to give him time to move and look for a job.\n\nI reminded him that he was lucky to have a good childhood with plenty of luxury, and that even paying to get him settled is a kindness. He accused us of prioritizing our retirement over his wellbeing, and said that we're lucky to be able to retire at all. He took it even further, and got his siblings involved.\n\nThey supported him to my surprise. They think we should either be fair and wait another couple years, or take him with us. When we didn't back down, our daughter said he could fly over to her house to stay there, despite sharing a one bedroom with her partner and our granddaughter.\n\nI think it's insane that they expect us to put our lives on hold for years just to allow him to live with us. But none of the kids have been talking to us much, so I guess their united against us.

You can certainly do what you wish, but kicking your child out with little to no notice is incredibly selfish. You're 45. Congratulations on being able to retire early, but you chose to have children. 3 children, no less. That your other children are on the same side as your son should give you a little more perspective. You chose to be parents, and that doesn't end at 18. Legally, perhaps it does, and in another time, but with this economy and the struggles people are having just to get by.

How will be support himself and still do well in college? If not, what is his path? What first career is he going into that can actually support him without a degree or apprenticeship that will allow him to support himself and build a life? \n\nMaybe you didn\u2019t think about this with the older two because you were not going anywhere- but most kids these days are not able to fully leave home and be completely financially self-sufficient until 23-25. Right now the cost of housing is way too high compared to starting salaries for anyone, let alone someone without a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nSo yeah- you are prioritizing your retirement over your youngest child\u2019s wellbeing and capacity to successfully launch into adulthood.

I'm 40 and called my mom up because I thought I was going crazy, she immediately offered me her home if I needed a break.  No questions asked.  I hope those savings last if you need a nursing home or you get sick.  And you are shocked, shocked you say, that your son won't let you stay with him.  It's pretty hypocritical.  You son does not owe you a place to stay. yta", "YTA Getting started in life with a good job and afford a place to live takes a lot longer than it used to. 19 is too young.

Are you never planning on having your children visit/stay with you? Why can't he just move in as well? None of this makes any sense.\n\nI know a lot of parents don't gaf about their kids after 18 in the U.S. but this just seems like a really odd choice to make given that you have 3 kids that don't live in the same area as you??\n\nYTA and surely you can see that? You absolutely are prioritizing your retirement over your son and for seemingly 0 reason.", "YTA. Why can\u2019t he still live with you? Are you downsizing to a 1 bed so there will literally be no space? Can your finances really not stretch to a 2 bed?

If your goal was retirement why have kids?", "YTA\n\nFor goodness sake just wait until your son has finished university. You most certainly are being unfair to him.

What a terrible disappointment as parents you must be.", "Noticed your 22 y/o son is still living with roommates. Have you ever considered why that may be? Because it\u2019s INSANELY expensive in todays economy to be able to afford living on your own. Your generation acts like a part time job is enough to support himself. \n\nWhen I was in college, I worked 60 hour weeks on top of school full time. Each job was above min wage. I could afford rent with 3 roommates, groceries (shopping at Aldi or other discount stores), and books every semester. I could sometimes throw maaaaaaybe a quarter worth of tuition in the pot, if I really budgeted and didn\u2019t do any extra activities (going out to eat ever, going to a movie, going to any events, buying coffee, etc). Everything else was loans.\n\nYou helped your other two children as long as they needed it - and it seems the 22 y/o could still need it as again, he has roommates. But you\u2019re ready to say see ya kid to the 19 y/o?? Absolutely a terrible parent.\n\nI can tell you this: my dad pulled all support my junior year of college - that is why I had to work 60 hours a week. I explained this to him, and he told me it was time to \u201clive his life\u201d as you say too. We do not speak. He will not walk me down the aisle at my wedding because he abandoned me at a time I needed support. You will find the same fate if you do this.

I\u2019m sure they see their value to you now and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they go no-contact with you and your spouse in the near future. \n\nHonestly why do you even want a relationship with your children at all if this is how you feel about them? If you\u2019re just done and going to move away and travel? And that is a serious question, not rhetorical.", "I guess it'll work out since your kids won't bother having a relationship with you so they'll never visit.", "Why can\u2019t it be 2 bedroom and your NINETEEN your old son will have a place to live while his deadbeat parents are \u201cout and about\u201d.", "I think it will be a given.", "Like the going no contact thing. I came from a family where everyone fought with everyone at some point. And we still love each other and help each other and are having a blast spending time together. If i were asked to babysit(another cultural hang up), i would say yes right away. If i were to write everything a member of my family said or did, they would faint and scream go nc and go to therapy so loud that the people at the ISS would hear them. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "So you\u2019re fucking over his education, finances, and making him homeless because you want to retire at 45? \n\nYou may not be a boomer but this is the most boomer shit I\u2019ve read in a while. His generation is already mega fucked, at least set him up for success.", "Sorry, but YTA. I would get it if he was sitting around not doing anything.  What place do you think he is going to be able to afford working part-time in this current housing situation?  Regardless if you pay the first month's rent and security deposit. You haven't even given him time to save money or even find a full-time job. Its kinda dirty to do your own kid like this, especially if he is actively working to do something with his life. Don't wait for years to retire in peace ( because you deserve to have the retirement you worked for), but give him more time than a few months even if you have to set some rules and parameters. By just kicking him out, you're not helping him,but you sure as hell is setting him up for failure.", "Yeah your a mega AH than", "He's in school and working PART time?! How the hell do you expect him to be able to find a place to rent on income like that? Jesus, y'all are heartless. And clearly way out of touch with the realities of living today. It's fine to sell your house and get a smaller place but why can't it be a two bedroom to give your kid a fighting chance? He could even house sit for you, since you insist you'll be gone all the time. Also are you never going to host guests? Including your other kids and grandchild?? You're just going to impose yourselves on them in their homes when you want to visit?", "He said he can\u2019t afford it, so have you done the math or are you choosing not to believe him based on no evidence or are you forcing your son to leave education for the sake of you getting this new house", "It is recommended to not go to school full time and work full time too. He is going to have to go to school part time while working full-time. Also many jobs doesn\u2019t care that you go to college. They want you to be available 24/7. Did you go to college full time while working full time so you can live somewhere?", "Is that what I wrote? No.", "Based on the post, I was similar to OPs son. No college. A basic job. It sounds like the son has several months notice which should be plenty of time to plan for it in an economy where there are plenty of jobs. Unless I'm misunderstanding the post, I don't see the problem making a plan and moving forward with it.", "I agree.  I wish I had figured that out about 10 years ago", "I said NTA because of my viewpoints on what a 19 year old \"should\" be able to do on their own.\n\nI joined the Army when I was 18 for college money and have supported myself completely since then. My parents had money, but from my perspective their responsibility to pay for me ended when I turned 18 (2nd of 4 boys).\n\nThey also didn't expect any support from us for their elder care, so it's all good.\n\nThis 19 yo has the same options I did - doesn't have to be the military, but there are other training programs that would allow him to sustain himself while he learned without requiring his parents support him.\n\nIf anything makes the OP an asshole it's that his 19 year old is 19 and completely unprepared for life as an adult.", "At 19 I moved, with no family financial support, from my little home town in Oklahoma to Los Angeles. Get a full time job.

Guess they never want their kids to visit or bring any potential spouses/kids", "YTA, obviously.", "You think OP seems sure? The question mark at the end of OP's answer suggests otherwise.", "Just one kid?? Seems like the daughter and older son also resents him for throwing their sibling out to the wolves for no reason.", ">Agree - the line \u201cI think it\u2019s insane that they expect us to put our life on hold for years just to allow him to live with us\u201d -\n\nThe horrors!  They'd have to start their retirement at the ripe old age of 50 which is too far gone to enjoy it.  OP is ridiculous at this rush to ignore his family so they can have fun traveling.", "Lmao, I fucking cackled when op was like \"they expect us to put our lives on hold for him?\" Like hello? What do you think having kids is?", "people like this generally want the kids, but forget that kids grow up into adults and stop wanting them when they\u2019re grown", "They probably could have retired even sooner if they didn\u2019t have kids.", "Sometimes I think it isn't even that much. I'm fairly certain some people, and I suspect OP might fall in to this category, have kids for no other reason than because \"you're just supposed to.\"", "And if I were their children, it would be the scummiest most sub par care home i could find too.  The OPs are the biggest AHs.", "Things were quite different in 2004. Doesn\u2019t mean this 19 year old boy should have to be super independent at 19 because they may have been.", "Wow rent is so high and don't get me started on groceries.Lets say this kid gets a job at minimum wage.There's no way he would be able afford thst,ultilties and groceries.", "One of the most popular newspapers here has been sharing stories of people who can't afford to even rent an apartment - from people who are doctors or engineers, to couples who are divorced but can not afford move out - some are even in abusive situations, which makes everything even more horrifying -  to students who have to drop out of Uni because even though they work and their parents help them, it's still not enough to live in the city. There's absolutely no way OP's son is able to work, study and rent an apartment by himself.", "Seriously. Even if they delay here and retire at 50, holy shit what a dream. Still young enough to  do whatever traveling they wanted w/o any cares. As opposed to most of us working till 65 and even then\u2026", "They are 45 and they don't even have to delay it. OP  gave no reason at all why the son could not come live with them in the city and finish his schooling like his siblings were allowed to do. They can still downsize and travel around and do whatever 45-year-old retirees do. A 19-year-old doesn't need a babysitter for when they want to travel or something.", "Yeah, I was really struck by the lack of any apparent emotional investment in this literal teenager, to the point that they\u2019re SURPRISED that his own sister would inconvenience herself to make sure he had a roof over his head. I would sure as heck have let my brother sleep on my couch if this had happened to him. Because he\u2019s my BROTHER and I wouldn\u2019t have wanted him to end up on street!\n\nBut fortunately our parents actually liked us.", "OP is living in some kind of 1960s dream boomer economy if they think any of this is possible.", "I wouldn't be surprised if all three kids turn their backs on the parents.

His older siblings got to live there because they legally had to provide for the youngest until he was 18. No other reason.", "Oops!", "And in three years he'll be graduating so he can work full time and be in a much better position to afford rent.", "I\u2019d guess their kids and grandkids will never want to visit them anyway so the parents can retire and live their miserable lives alone together.", "I fell like the answers to your questions are obvious given how big an AH the parents are\u2026", "They made the point to complain about their oldest saying they can't stay with him when he finds a house, so I'm guessing yes.", "I don\u2019t think he needs to worry about his kids/grandkids showing up. \n\nOP, you can obviously do what you want, but so can your kids. You\u2019ve chosen to be absolutely unfair to your youngest, so they\u2019re choosing to go LC/NC with you. Actions have consequences. If you take this action, you already know the consequences. \n\nYour only option now is to either decide to continue with your plans and lose contact with your kids/grandkids or delay your plans and act like a parent for a few more years so you can keep contact. Although I do think you\u2019ve likely damaged the relationships with trying this in the first place. \n\nYTA.", "When they had to put money towards them/s", "Sounds like too little too late for that.  Oldest has already decided Mom & Dad won't have a place to stay with them when he gets a house, sis is willing to support the youngest since OP is too selfish to bother anymore and I'm sure the 19yo isn't feeling terribly loving anymore towards the parents either.\n\nThat's not to say a relationship can't be rebuilt, however I think OP has definitely blown up the relationship with the kids.", "And he'd probably have to drop out to be able to work full time and afford rent, is that really what OP wants for him?", "I guess OP and his spouse are wanting him to not her an education and just work full time to pay for a tiny, smelly overpeiced apartment.", "Yes, it is.

But I have recently noticed a big trend of parents just wanting -babies- and not necessarily children who will be around for at least 18 years.", "Shit I wouldn't even find one for them \ud83d\ude02, they can sort it themselves. Abandon them like they wanted to abandon their children.

I\u2019ll be working until about 15 minutes before my funeral.", "Right!  Like why can\u2019t they find a two bedroom place in the city and let him live there?

But I'm guessing it's just the land of massive privilege and zero empathy.", "I\u2019m GenX and when I graduated from HS the economy was awful. It\u2019s not like things were so easy when they were young. So there is not even that pitiful excuse. They\u2019re just assholes.", "trying to piece together what they\u2019ve done that allowed them to start having kids at age 20, have 3 of them, and retire at 45."]}
