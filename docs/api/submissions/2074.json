My sister and I aren't close. She's not a warm person. We've never had a major falling out, we just aren't close. At big family events I usually played with my nephew & niece, who are 12 and 8, and I'd make chitchat with my sister & BIL but mostly it was about the kids. But over the past 2 years now that the kids have tablets, I've noticed that my sister and BIL do not speak to me or my husband at family events. Even if it's just them, us, and my parents. They come into the house, and they don't say hello to us or even look at my husband and I. And it's not a frosty \"We had a huge fight\" silence. They just do not recognize that we exist, so I always have to say \"Hello Sister's Name, hello Brother in Law\", and they say \"Hey\" and that's it. If I ask about their work or their lives, they'll answer me, but they don't ask me or my husband anything. It is completely one sided.  \n\nEver since I've noticed it, I can't unsee it. The last family event, Labour Day, I thought heck with it I'm not saying anything to them either. My sister confronted me in the kitchen and said \"Uh, hi??\" and I said \"Hello\" and that was it. I skipped my family's Thanksgiving because I was so perturbed by it. \n\nSo this Christmas, it's only going to be my parents & sister and brother in law, and their kids. So I said screw this, we're going to my husband's family (we usually alternate and this is \"my family's\" year). My inlaws are lovely. My brothers in law are lovely and I get on fantastic with both of them, so I'm really looking forward. But anyway, now my parents are upset because my niece and nephew are allegedly upset that their aunt, who always plays with them and their new toys, isn't coming, and I wasn't there last year and I skipped Thanksgiving so I'm \"abandoning my family\". But I can't take the awkwardness anymore, and my sister isn't a person you can have a conversation with in the hopes she'll see logic. It just would not be worth my emotional energy to try. I've explained to my mother \"Sister doesn't speak to or look at my husband and I\" and I was told that can't possibly be true, so obviously, apple falling from tree.

Would your parents be the only one talking, carrying a conversation with both halves? I know some parents like this.
