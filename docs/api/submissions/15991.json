She tries to live beyond her means and expects someone else to bail her out. This behavior has not changed since having my niece Valentina (Tina) and Jessica has in fact been even less responsible with her spending.\n\nJessica has been behind on her rent for months. She\u2019s treated it like a joke, constantly going to the mall and even taking Tina on an expensive spring break vacation. Jessica\u2019s landlord told her that she had one last chance to pay back her rent within the next two weeks, or else he would be forced to evict her.\n\nSome background on my family is that they all live in a very large house. Two stories, seven bedrooms, and a large yard. Family members built it generations ago, so my family pays practically nothing in taxes. But they are not at all well-off. Their collective income is so low that they qualify and rely on services such as the food bank.\n\nFor this reason, they are unable to help Jessica pay back her rent. My family is hoping that I will help because if Jessica and Tina move into my family\u2019s house, Tina would be forced to transfer to a bad school district. Tina\u2019s current school will allow her to finish the year but after, she is expected to transfer and begin 6th grade at a different school district.\n\nJessica is begging me to help with her rent because she doesn\u2019t want Tina to have to leave all her friends behind. She is also very worried because the school district within our family's address is known for being a bad one. This district has had many issues (such as drugs) since we attended as students.\n\nThe amount Jessica needs would be a lot for me. It would still be possible for me to give it, but I refused. I told Jessica that this is on her. She chose to live beyond her means and treat her rent issues like a joke. I\u2019m not responsible for her choices. She chose to have a child. My love for Tina does not make her my responsibility.\n\nIt will be hard for Tina, but 6th grade is still easier to adapt to a new school and friend groups constantly change during that age anyway. I also reminded Jessica that despite the issues at this school district, we didn\u2019t get involved in any of those bad activities because we were taught not to give in to peer pressure. Tina is a smart girl and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine.\n\nMy family has told me that they are disappointed in Jessica but are disappointed in me as well. And they said that Jessica is irresponsible but that they hoped I would put my niece\u2019s well-being first. I still feel that this situation is entirely of Jessica\u2019s making and she has sole responsibility for it. Besides, it\u2019s not as if Jessica or Tina will be homeless. They\u2019ll be able to stay at the family house. Tina will still have access to an education, even if it\u2019s not as good as the one offered by her previous school district.

If your sister wouldn't pay back her landlord, who I assume she has a legal contract with, why should anyone expect her to pay you back when she already feels entitled to favours from you?

She is using your niece to guilt you - The situation isn't ideal, but your niece will be fine. Every child that attends the \"lesser\" school district is not doomed to failure.

You do not owe your sister money to support her spendthrift ways. They will not improve. And your family is wrong to judge you for not paying.

You need to sit down with all the family members who are hassling you for not helping Jessica, Jessica herself, and even Tina (although her involvement may need to be a separate conversation with everyone else after the main conversation\u2026Tina has every right to know since it involves her). Make sure you have the conversation planned before going in and tell everyone that you demand to have everything you need to say first without any interruptions (they WILL try to interrupt and demand and be angry\u2026). Tell Jessica that if she doesn\u2019t want to have Tina to have to change school districts, she needs to clean up her act, because right now Tina moving into a \u201cbad\u201d school district is on her shoulders due to her poor decisions. Tell everyone that you will be happy to sit down with Jessica (and to a lesser extent Tina\u2026these lessons should start about now\u2026) and help her learn to budget from planning the budget to implementing that budget and maintaining that budget, but you will not continue to enable her mismanagement by bailing her out. Tell your family that if they want to help continue the cycle for Jessica, and likely Tina as well, by bailing her out and enabling this continued behavior then that\u2019s their choice but you don\u2019t want to hear about it. Tell them you will even help Jessica figure out how to get out of her current situation (helping her go to a bank and get a loan for example) but reiterate that you will not bail her out. As for Tina being part of the conversation, she is almost at the age where she will understand (if she doesn\u2019t already since you said she\u2019s a smart girl) what\u2019s happening. You likely don\u2019t want her to be part of the conversation where she learns the problems are her mom\u2019s fault, but she does need to be part of the conversation where she is aware that there are some financial difficulties and that everyone is coming together to help her mom fix it (without outright giving her the money). She needs to learn the concept of cause and effect which in this case is more actions/behaviors and consequences.", "NTA.  How many able-bodied adults are living in that giant house rent free?  Could they rent out rooms to supplement Jessica's spending?  Could they scrape together jobs to pay Jessica's rent since none of them pay any rent whatsoever?\n\nUnfortunately children do bear the brunt of their parent's bad decisions, but bailing her out isn't going to fix anything.  Are you going to have to pay Jessica's rent for the next 6 years until Tina graduates?  It's not sustainable.  If the school is that bad, consider it motivation for Jessica to figure something out.  She can save up by not paying rent.", "Also, now that she can go to the family home this will be more motivating for her to get back to the other school district. Hopefully she will save her money to get another apartment", "NTA. If the mother of the child does not put that child first, why should you?", "NTA.\n\nTina isn't the only child who has to go to a poor school (so do all the kids who go there). Jessica is your sister, but she is also a bratty moocher. Unless someone says \"NO\" to her and means it, she will just get worse and worse with money. And you won't be able to cover her forever.

I can see bill collectors starting to show up at OPs home.", "I live in the general area, but my address and place of work are not within the range of Tina's school district. Because Jessica will have to move, there's no argument that can be made for Tina to stay in her current school district.", "This was my first thought. Who\u2019s gonna save her next? No one & they\u2019ll have to move back to the family school & change school irregardless.
