Everyone and every culture is a little different.\n\nI don't think your mother in law is at fault either. Your daughter suggested it by saying \"with me\" so maybe the daughter really did want to join grandma in the bath. \n\nAs a note:\nI'm living in Japan where it's normal for people to take baths together at the hot springs or onsen. I'll probably take baths with my husband and son at the public baths (using the rented family baths) until my son is 11 or 12.

At another time, in different circumstances might you disapprove of something that is in fact totally innocuous because of the way you were brought up?\n\nBTW, is your MIL allowed to give your daughter a bath, meaning that she remains fully clothed next to the bath and washes and later dries your daughter?\n\nFinally, I think the matter will probably come up in discussion with your wife. Try not to come across as completely rigid in your views, but ask her about how things went in her family.

You can make the rules for your child, and if you don't want her to take a bath with Grandma that's fine. In my family it's normal for a mom or grandma to take a bath with the baby, but if it's not for you, simply say \"that's not something we share here, but grandma can play with you after her bath\". I will say it's a lot easier to get a baby clean while sharing a bath than it is leaning over the tub. Plus you can play with bath toys and write their name with bath crayons. It's fun and sweet.", "NAH -  you get to set boundaries you want.  But just realize that you make it sound if your mil was pushing your child to shower with her.  She didn\u2019t seem like she was and the way you reacted sounded a little accusatory.\n\nBut truthfully bathing with others is a common thing down around the world.  Many many cultures have bathhouses, saunas or onsens.  I live in Japan and well onsens are quite common and popular.  My children have bathed with my parents (American) and my in laws (Japanese) until they decided that they no longer wanted to.  In fact at one point no one could take a shower or a bath with out my son stripping down and sneaking in.  He surprised my mother with that one day.  My son is ten now and he no longer bathes with me but does so quite often with his father and goes with him to the onsens.  My daughter at 14 however doesn\u2019t go because she\u2019s at that age where her body is changing and she\u2019s uncomfortable doing so.  So we don\u2019t push it.

This is a no for you, and see where the conversation goes. \n\nPersonally, I don't think your MIL should feel so entitled to your child that she wouldn't check if it was okay. Sure, in her culture they might do it, but you aren't from that culture, and that's okay.", "NTA. As parents it is entirely up to the two of you if you feel comfortable with other people being naked in front of your child. Your MIL should have asked if this was okay before just walking off and assuming it was. I am sure she had no ill intentions but it's a matter of asking a parent's permission before you do things with their child, this goes for taking a walk or taking a bath. It's standard to clear activities with the parents first.", "I think anyone who finds this weird needs to examine why they are sexualising a child. I\u2019d be interested to find how you \u00ab\u00a0find it weird\u00a0\u00bb what makes it weird?\nCommunal bathing is common across the globe and all cultures\nI think it\u2019s very healthy for kids to see all kinds of different normal body types as well rather than just the pristine people in popular media.", "Omg!! Lol what?? I am sorry but thats creepy.. if your daughter wanted to take a bath with you that's more understandable because you are the parent.", "NAH. It\u2019s perfectly normal, but it\u2019s okay if that\u2019s a boundary for you. I pretty much always shower or bathe with my toddler because she asks me to and it helps save me time.", "NAH but it is very common to bathe together within a family.  I'm guessing your family didn't do it so it's okay to have a boundry.  Ask your wife, from your MIL not thinking twice about it I bet your wife took baths with many family members as a child.", "You\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re defo weird. It\u2019s a strange thing to have an issue with. That being said, well done for making your boundaries clear.", "NAH. She didn't know that was a boundary for you, and you set it. Problem solved for the future.", "Yeah my parents had a big jacuzzi tub. When we were little my dad would throw on swim trunks and get in with me and my brother. We also learned that bubble bath + jacuzzi jets equals an entire room filled with bubbles!", "It doesn't have to be sinister to be a safety concern. Water is dangerous, we don't know how careful the MIL is.", "He can't just kick his wifes mother out, that would be extremely controlling and cruel. She has done nothing wrong.", "I would shower with my toddler niece after a day at the beach. It was easier to rinse sand off both of us than to try and keep her in the bathroom while I showered, then bathe her after. She was 2/3 and neither of her parents cared that she showered with me.", "I showered with child A because A would cry the whole time I was in the shower if I did not. It was the only way to peacefully self care. Baby B is 9 months old and never showers with me. Baby B is content to sit on a bath mat and watch me or play with a toy. Normal is whatever the hell works lol.", "I think that partially depends on if you're from a culture that typically takes baths instead of showers. If a bath is how you bathe in general then it's not uncommon to take a toddler in with you the same way it's not uncommon to take a toddler in the shower if that's how you bathe in general.", "Not sure why you\u2019ve gotten downvoted so much.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with this that is okay! You are the parent, and so you get to set the boundaries. Other folks need to respect those boundaries without question as long as it\u2019s not something harmful to your kid, which obviously this is not a harmful boundary.\n\nI\u2019ve had friends say their parents didn\u2019t let them go to sleepovers growing up due to fear of sexual abuse. It might be somewhat irrational but the stats speak for themselves, and ultimately, that\u2019s their choice as parents on how to best raise/protect their kids", "My grandson used to say it was because I made the water \u2018go bigger\u2019 lol I never knew whether to be offended or not.", "But OP doesn't have an issue with Grandma being outside of the tub while bathing the kid, so idk why being in the tub would be any less safe.", "What the fuck lol.", "So, no going to the swimming pool ever then... unless there are private cubicals and the child is old enough to dress on their own. No school swimming trips, no swimming with grandparents, no going to the beach during the summer, no getting muddy and removing the clothes before you go inside, no changing nappies unless you're in complete privacy\n\nThis attitude will hold a child back from living a normal childs life.", "My little sister and I took baths until we were about 8 and 10. One of our parents would wash our hair and then we'd spend the rest of the time playing in the water. We had some really cool bath toys! Our favorite were these little foam blocks that stuck to the side of the tub.", "tf.....", "We didn't have a shower when I was a kid so everybody took baths, but I mainly just remember bathing with my sister. But I think it would've been too crowded if one of my parents was also in the tub lol", ">that\u2019s their choice as parents on how to best raise/protect their kids\n\nOk but sometimes parents make stupid fucking choices.\n\nAs far as bathtime for baby/toddler with a grandparent, not a big deal either way! But IMO the types of parents who are so afraid of their kid getting sexually abused that they don't allow their kid to do normal kid stuff for their entire childhood? At a certain point that does more harm than good. Not EVERY choice a parent makes deserves to be respected.", "Why would that be more of a safety risk than bathing a kid by themselves?", "I'm definitely not first gen American (family traced back to the Mayflower) and grew up in a predominately white area. I don't find anything weird about young children bathing with their parents or grandparents, but I suppose specific family culture could come into play since every family has their own little traditions.", "I dunno I was a kid in the early 00s and I def remember bathing/showering with family.", "I don't remember taking baths with either of my parents, but I do remember showering with my mom in campground showers a few times. I also know several parents who shower with their young kids. It's not that weird.", "I think it's weird to sexualize children's bodies and casual nudity in safe spaces, and let their first experiences with the variety of the human body be either through idealized media or the pressure of the middle school locker room. *shrug* Every family is different.", "Idk fire, another emergency with the child. Its just impractical and risky.", "Who is to decide? There is no one right way to raise a child, and it is up to each parent to decide what they feel is right for their children. It\u2019s not for the rest of us to judge or intervene unless something legitimately harmful to the safety of that child is happening. \n\nAll parents make stupid choices because that\u2019s what being a human is. It doesn\u2019t make them bad parents for doing things differently or having different beliefs than someone else would", "I have no clue why that was only thing that came up when I was wondering why OP is so uncomfortable with it. I can delete it if it is really stupid question", "I dated a guy less than 10 years ago who regularly showered with his toddler. He's a single dad, so it was just faster and easier to shower together. There was no way he could take a shower and keep the kid occupied at the same time.", "The one time I took a bath with my, then infant, daughter, she pooped on me. We didn\u2019t do that again but she does shower with me still at 18 months. I\u2019ll start switching to a bath soon because baby on the way but she\u2019s fine right now. She took a few with her dad as a baby, but in general he wasn\u2019t home at bath time for a while. He did a couple times as she got older but he wore underwear because of his own comfort. If he ever did it was just for convenience, I do just because it\u2019s easier than a bath every day and she\u2019s always sticky and gross and wipes do not cut it with this kid.", "I think it's weird to bathe with parents/grandparents.", "Not so risky if you have a second adult not in the bath but nearby, surely?", "Do you often have a reason to run out of the shower because of an emergency? I can't say I've ever had that issue, but if I needed to then I'd just step into the bath mat and quickly dry off my feet.", ">There is no one right way to raise a child\n\nThere are definitely wrong ways to do it, and those children grow up into adults who are absolutely going to judge their parents for making poor choices.", "There's no need to delete it, I was just curious about your thinking. An adult should hopefully know how to dry off quickly if there was an emergency, so I don't think there is any additional risk in that situation.", "Do we?? I feel like my family are very prudish. I never really saw my parents undressed or anything and definitely not in the bath.", "Yea exactly", "Don\u2019t do it then. You are allowed to choose. Go you!", "When did anyone say it was universal? Common means lots of people do it, not everyone does or everyone has to.", "I admit that sentence is result of not thinking \ud83e\udd2a", "I'm not doing it because it's weird.", "Everybody acting like it's a normal thing to do.", "Hey, I can't judge you for that! I'm sure we've all had thoughts that we didn't really think about lol", "If your MIL stopped after that one comment, NAH. You have different cultural ideas about family bathing. \n\nIf your MIL has kept on about it, then N T A.", "I was molested by a family member under the guise they were just helping me in the shower, this went on for years and I\u2019m still messed up about it. OP is not wrong, and it\u2019s not normal for a grown adult to want to get in the shower or bath with an innocent child. There\u2019s sick people in this world, and it\u2019s not the guy in the white van\u2026.. it\u2019s the person sitting across from you at Christmas dinner. Some people are normal people with good intentions but are you really going to take that chance with your baby? Why take the chance they could be molested, because some people think \u201cit\u2019s normal\u201d or you don\u2019t want to hurt the other persons feelings? Both were said to me when I asked why this person was allowed to be in the shower with me \u201chelping me\u201d (molesting me) and I was told that it was a normal thing in the family to help one another. You can\u2019t guarantee your family isn\u2019t going to harm your child, and it sucks to think like that, I get it, but here I am going into my late 20s and I\u2019m losing sanity over what I went through because so many memories flood back at the wrong time. I\u2019m not trying to rant but I do want to be a voice for those children out there put into unsafe situations with a family member, where they could be abused. All I was reading in the comments was it\u2019s normal to bath and shower with family, Someone needed to say the hard truth of reality.

We've never bathed with our child she's had her own bath with us helping obviously. I'm not saying anything bad about people who share baths like do you but if your uncomfortable with your child being in the bath with anyone it's ok to say that.\nAnd no I'm not saying anything creepy would happen I'm just uncomfortable with anyone being in my child's bath when they are all naked. \nI used to absolutely hate my mum getting in my bath and once I told her she stopped. She never did anything I just wanted my bath to be just me. I don't think anything badly to families that do that either. But I don't like how people are insinuating that people that don't must not becouse they are sexualising it. That's not the reason for it. It can just make you uncomfortable or you value own space and privacy and do things differently.", "NAH as long as everyone drops it and your boundary on the issue is respected going forward.

Totally normal to do with toddlers imo, but now that I think of it I'm pretty sure my husband won't be into our kids participating lol.", "For me it's not that it's sinister I just don't want my naked child with naked relatives in a bath when it's something we've never done. \nWe all get our own baths and il be in the room since she's five to make sure she's ok. I think it's just different people. My mum used to get a bath with me and I hated it I felt exposed and once I told her I didn't like it she stopped. Some people are just more private I don't think there's anything wrong either way just that peoples wishes should be respected. If the mum doesn't want them in the tub then that's that.. it dosnt have to be because she's thinking something creepy.", "There can be multiple valid reasons IMO.\n\nOne is that it may disrupt the routine for the child, and the child will no longer do regular baths and showers. Another is that it gives the impression that the child gets whatever they ask for. The MIL may not know how to properly clean a child since pediatric care has improved in the last 30 years since she's had to do it. For me, the biggest concern here is that it's a decision making process that should involve the parent. Many people can argue that something like this doesnt require parents involvement. But the child doesn't understand what requests they want require parents involvement. \n\nI find it strange many others not faulting the grandmother because she should've run this by the parents. What is considered \"normal\" may not be considered normal for others. IMO, the MIL over stepped by making decisions.", "It's not to do with sexualising it's that some people don't want their naked child with somone else naked .
