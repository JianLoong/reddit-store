Everyone and every culture is a little different.\n\nI don't think your mother in law is at fault either. Your daughter suggested it by saying \"with me\" so maybe the daughter really did want to join grandma in the bath. \n\nAs a note:\nI'm living in Japan where it's normal for people to take baths together at the hot springs or onsen. I'll probably take baths with my husband and son at the public baths (using the rented family baths) until my son is 11 or 12.

But you might just examine within yourself whether the fact that your Mother wouldn\u2019t have a bath with her granddaughter has conditioned your reaction. Again, I don\u2019t disagree with you, but sometimes it\u2019s a good idea to look at oneself and question one\u2019s own norms and ideas, if only to see their value in perspective. At another time, in different circumstances might you disapprove of something that is in fact totally innocuous because of the way you were brought up?\n\nBTW, is your MIL allowed to give your daughter a bath, meaning that she remains fully clothed next to the bath and washes and later dries your daughter?\n\nFinally, I think the matter will probably come up in discussion with your wife. Try not to come across as completely rigid in your views, but ask her about how things went in her family. Did she have baths with her grandmother?", "Bit odd, but nothing wrong with being odd, hope the little one brings you lots of joy :).", "Really should spend more time in Europe, Africa, and South America.\n\nIt's pretty common in those continents.", "My grandkids are 19 and 17 now.

It's not really weird unless there's some sort of fear or trauma, then I totally get the concern. They will start setting their own boundaries as they grow older, some sooner than others.", "NAH. You can make the rules for your child, and if you don't want her to take a bath with Grandma that's fine. In my family it's normal for a mom or grandma to take a bath with the baby, but if it's not for you, simply say \"that's not something we share here, but grandma can play with you after her bath\". I will say it's a lot easier to get a baby clean while sharing a bath than it is leaning over the tub. Plus you can play with bath toys and write their name with bath crayons. It's fun and sweet.", "NAH -  you get to set boundaries you want.  But just realize that you make it sound if your mil was pushing your child to shower with her.  She didn\u2019t seem like she was and the way you reacted sounded a little accusatory.\n\nBut truthfully bathing with others is a common thing down around the world.  Many many cultures have bathhouses, saunas or onsens.  I live in Japan and well onsens are quite common and popular.  My children have bathed with my parents (American) and my in laws (Japanese) until they decided that they no longer wanted to.  In fact at one point no one could take a shower or a bath with out my son stripping down and sneaking in.  He surprised my mother with that one day.  My son is ten now and he no longer bathes with me but does so quite often with his father and goes with him to the onsens.  My daughter at 14 however doesn\u2019t go because she\u2019s at that age where her body is changing and she\u2019s uncomfortable doing so.  So we don\u2019t push it.

NTA for sure.", "Ok. Totally fair. My first thought was you were not ok because of safety reasons. A baby in a plastic tub can not drown, but in a full bath tub?

Nudity within our own household has never been taboo or something we made seem weird, shameful, or sexual, at least among our household.
