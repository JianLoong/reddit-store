Gran can sit on the edge of the bath with their legs in. That what my ex's mother did with my daughter and triple checked with me that was okay. \n\nWhile there's nothing nefarious sure, it's not something that should be encouraged at all. We don't normalise sharing naked moments with adults like that.

You\u2019re her dad and you have a say, you aren\u2019t okay with that and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good to be cautious. It would be one thing if she was just giving your daughter a bath, but her jumping in would be questionable. At the same time, I\u2019m sure she has good intentions and is thinking \u201cif I\u2019m giving her a bath, I\u2019m going to get wet so I might as well take one too. Either way, NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA - this is extremely inappropriate behaviour. Your child doesn't understand boundaries and the adults in her life are responsible to teach her what is and isn't ok.

Maybe you have a gut feeling that makes you uncomfortable with the idea or maybe you just don't think children and adults should bathe together. Everyone and every culture is a little different.\n\nI don't think your mother in law is at fault either. Your daughter suggested it by saying \"with me\" so maybe the daughter really did want to join grandma in the bath. \n\nAs a note:\nI'm living in Japan where it's normal for people to take baths together at the hot springs or onsen. I'll probably take baths with my husband and son at the public baths (using the rented family baths) until my son is 11 or 12. Once he's closer to puberty then he'll go with his dad to the men's side and I'll go to the women's side. There are strangers of all ages in the baths, and it's not seen as anything sexual.", "NTA it\u2019s entirely up to you I used to get in the bath with my daughter all the time, but I stopped when she turned 1 because I felt like I shouldn\u2019t be in there with her, I don\u2019t need to get in the bath to play with toys and splash about with her.\n\nMaybe tell your MIL she can bath and play with her and it will be just as fun for both without her having to get in the bath herself", "That's not something I feel comfortable with and I feel the same way with every other person that's not my wife, I would have reacted the same with my own mother. (my mother would've never done that, tho).", "this is perfect\n\n\"we don't normalize sharing naked moments with adults\"", "Yeah this is it, I wonder if the people here disagreeing with OP would be singing the same tune if it was Grandpa wanting to take a bath with their 20 month old kid lol. Grandma doesn't need to get naked in the bath with the kid and it's not weird that OP doesn't allow it.", "Not saying you\u2019re wrong. But you might just examine within yourself whether the fact that your Mother wouldn\u2019t have a bath with her granddaughter has conditioned your reaction. Again, I don\u2019t disagree with you, but sometimes it\u2019s a good idea to look at oneself and question one\u2019s own norms and ideas, if only to see their value in perspective. At another time, in different circumstances might you disapprove of something that is in fact totally innocuous because of the way you were brought up?\n\nBTW, is your MIL allowed to give your daughter a bath, meaning that she remains fully clothed next to the bath and washes and later dries your daughter?\n\nFinally, I think the matter will probably come up in discussion with your wife. Try not to come across as completely rigid in your views, but ask her about how things went in her family. Did she have baths with her grandmother?", "Bit odd, but nothing wrong with being odd, hope the little one brings you lots of joy :).", "Really should more time in Europe, Africa, and South America.\n\nIt's pretty common in those continents."]}
