It\u2019s come back several times but I\u2019ve always been able to go back into remission. \n\nWhen I was initially diagnosed in 1998, I wanted no one to know. I needed to come to terms with it. I knew I couldn\u2019t if I told family, because I\u2019d be more worried about how they\u2019d be handling my treatments. It\u2019s counterproductive. \n\nTrust that when she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll share. It\u2019s her struggle to share, not yours. Find a support group. No one knows what you\u2019re dealing with more than someone else in the same shoes (a caregiver )", "YWBTA. They're her parents, it's her information to share. If she needs a little time to process that before she's ready to tell them, that's her decision. \n\nTalk to your wife about needing support and someone to talk to about this in the meantime. Maybe your parents would be a better choice?", "YWBTA - no question about it. It would be an immeasurably wildly selfish thing for you to do. Your wife is trying to come to terms with it HERSELF, let alone trying to manage someone else\u2019s grief and pain. She doesn\u2019t sound ready to face it yet, and blabbing her private medical information all over the place before she\u2019s ready robs her of her agency and the ability to take her time to process the information, break the news to her loved ones on her own terms, and steals the time she needs to make decisions and handle her own grief before having to manage other people\u2019s grief and emotions.", "YWBTA\n\nGive her time to tell them when she\u2019s ready. The diagnosis is VERY new. She probably can\u2019t handle her own feelings, let alone the emotional storm that will be dumped on her when she tells them.\n\nThat being said, you do deserve a person to share and talk with. A friend, a pastor, your parents/family. That\u2019s completely reasonable. \n\nJust don\u2019t take away her autonomy for your needs.", "YWBTA. Go to therapy if you need someone to talk to.  Let her have control over who knows this incredibly huge news about her life. She just had a ton of control taken away from her. It\u2019s totally understandable that you did too but she gets to make the decisions ultimately.", "First of all, I am so, so sorry. I can't fathom what you are feeling right now.\n\nIf you feel like you need support you can talk to a therapist or join online communities going through the same. Please don't tell her parents behind her back. Give her the time she needs to process her feelings.", "She needs time to process her diagnosis and doesn't want her parents to know yet. Respect that. Talk to a close friend so you have the support you need and give her time.\n\nI'm sorry - this is awful for you. But YWBTA to tell her parents behind her back and against her wishes, especially as she has just had her diagnosis.", "What is left of her life is already so far out of her control, and you're contemplating removing more of that control?  No.  YWBTA.  This is NOT your choice to make.  Nor should you try to talk her into making the choice as you want it.", "YWBTA.  You're both processing a lot and she is going to die, likely relatively soon with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nYou both need to come to terms with it first.  Of course her parents will want to know but don't betray her now by telling them.", "YWBTA it\u2019s not your information to share.", "Ywbta if you told without your wife's permission. However, the 2-3 year life expectancy is an estimate. My grandpa had heart surgery the day I was born and the doctors told him he would have 5 years. My grandpa passed away when I was 21, way past what the doctors told him. I really hope your family will be lucky like mine and get more time with your wife!!!\n\nEdit to add: he had a total artificial heart (TAH)", "YTA if you tell them.\n\nThis is her news to tell, it's her life and her death.  Yes, you're affected by it, and yes it impacts you, but you're not the one dying.  Once people know they will not look at her the same, she's clearly not ready for that.  If you need someone to talk to, get a therapist, you're going to need one anyway.  That's someone you can freely talk to who must keep your confidence.  Anyone else you tell could spread it around.  It would be a MASSIVE betrayal if you did this without her consent.", "OP, I am so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re both going through. \n\nI can tell you- when you tell someone what is happening, it becomes very real. She may not emotional be ready for that. She also may have legitimate concerns about the way her parents will handle the news and the stress it will cause. YWBTA, if you did it without her permission, but I know it\u2019s coming from a good place. \n\nTalk to your wife. Ask her what she needs from you to help her tell her family. Remind her you\u2019re in this together and she\u2019s not alone.", "Yes, you absolutely would be the asshole if you did this. You need to support your wife right now and you can do that by respecting her wishes. Everything is big and scary and out of control. Let her have this one thing and find yourself a support group AND a therapist. You're going to need both.\n\nYTA if you do tell her parents.", "I\u2019m so sorry for the diagnosis and the challenge this represents. But YWBTA If you told her parents - she just needs a moment to catch her breath.  Giver her time and have her back.", "YWBTA. But is she a transplant candidate? Has that even been discussed with you all? This is a common reason for heart/lung transplants.", "Let her know the reasons you would want your children to tell you as the parent, if the cards were reversed and then ask her how you can help her disclose it because it has to happen. No one wants a surprise like that after the death. You sir, will become those parent's source of anger. But once again it's all on her", "My hubby and I have the agreement that neither of us is the boss of the other and until physically unable to make decisions we respect each others decisions concerning health care.", "YTA. She doesn't want her parents--HER parents, not yours--to know yet, and you would be directly going against her wishes because YOU feel they should know. Abide by her wishes. Not doing so will make a difficult situation worse.", "YWBTA  \nShe deserves the respect of deciding what she tells HER parents about HER diagnosis. If you really need someone to talk to, there is specific support groups for people going through the same things you yourself are as the partner of a sick person, you should look for one of those. She has not given you consent to share her medical information, and even in marriage it's her right to chose what people know.", "YWBTA. \n\nYou made vows to your wife, not to her parents. Your obligation is to her, not her parents. \n\nDo not do this. It's not your information to share, and all you'll do by sharing it is alienate your wife both from you and likely from her family as well. \n\nI'm sorry for both of you. This has to be hard, but violating your wife's privacy rights is not going to make it easier. If you need to talk to someone about it (very understandable) find a therapist or speak to a friend who isn't closely acquainted with your wife, under a promise of confidentiality.", "NAH\n\nIts her diagnosis, and she must control that info. You need to stay out of it.\n\nBut you need support also. So a therapist to help you work through this. But I would also suggest an attorney. Both must keep private, any  of her medical info you tell them. The attorney can help you navigate the legal paperwork and the added insult of health care costs and protecting yourself (and kids) from financial ruin \n\nSo sorry for your family OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Notjus4ne1 I pray you do well.", "Or a therapist.", "YWBTA, as a person who just underwent heart surgery when I told my parents what was happening and the prognosis it went awfully, I mean I literally \u201cran away\u201d (aka phone on airplane mode and a note for my roommate that I was okay and would be back). Suddenly I was responsible for their feelings, I had an overwhelming amount of questions, and It was constant fighting. And I\u2019m relatively close to my parents. I wish I could\u2019ve had time to process on my own. But instead was bribed (to not have the surgery) and offered zero support. Not once was I asked if I was okay or how I was handling this. I finally visited them a few weeks before the surgery and I had to make a rule of \u201cno heart talk\u201d (which wasn\u2019t followed).\nPlease let this be her timeline. Sometimes freezing time after a diagnosis like that feels more comforting than anything else. Having people who don\u2019t know feels like it\u2019s not happening, it gives a chance to \u201cforget\u201d for a little while. It\u2019s good. Keep communicating with her. If you don\u2019t feel that this way of coping is good for you, see a therapist, ask her if there\u2019s one person you both can trust with this information, etc.", "Ywbta. \n\nThat would be an excellent way to be going through a divorce instead of enjoying what time you have left with her. \n\nGo to therapy if you need to talk to someone instead of adding more stress to your poor wife.", "YWBTA - don\u2019t betray her at her hardest moment", "I wish you and your wife long and happy life. \nI will not vote but just to let you know, my mom has been diagnosed with rare heart deffect and doctors told her that she has 5 years to live. It was 30 years ago and she is still with us and active.", "Same as everyone else sorry. YWBTA if you told.\n\nTalk to a friend or therapist if you need support. Your partner is learning to cope with this news herself. The second her parents and others find out, EVERYTHING changes for her.\n\nShe then has to support others and pretend to be the strong one. No one will ever treat her the same again. It's common to lose friends because they either can't deal with it, they feel awkward and don't know what to say, or they feel like everything then has to be morose and about the cancer.\n\nYou can talk to her about it and explain why you'd like them to know, but don't make the choice against her wishes.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear about what your family\u2019s going through. \n\nYWBTA - ultimately it\u2019s her diagnosis and her journey. You can\u2019t take that decision away from her - she need to process it and let them know when she\u2019s ready. You\u2019ll be adding stress and resentment in your relationship. There are groups for people who are I\u2019ll and their partners which may provided some help", "Yes, YWBTA. Your instincts are horribly wrong. Literally every doctor would tell you that. She told you that. Listen to them.  \n\nAlso, are you sure that she isn't a valid candidate for transplant? PAH is considered treatable, rather than terminal, these days. Double lung generally works, and full heart+lung exists as an option. I don't mean to second-guess her doctors, but it sounds like you're originally from another country than the one in which you reside. Have you explored transplant options in both?", "YWBTA.\n\nAs someone who has been \u201couted\u201d for a chronic illness, this topic resonates deep, deep within my soul. I highly recommend you allow her to make the decision. Her life has been taken away from her, don\u2019t take another thing.", "It is up to her to tell, but I knew how difficult it is for you. Whe. My ex-husband first told me about his cancer diagnosis, he didn't want anyone to know.  Keeping it from our children put tremendous stress on me that caused physical damage to me.  My health both physically and mentally was ruined.  Not having a friend or my mom to speak to made it worse.  Then my kids saw a broken falling apart mom and had no idea why. It was a terrible situation to be in.  So I definitely can sympathize.   But she needs to tell them.  You need to tell her how it's affecting you.", "OMG yes, YWBTA. I can sympathize with your need to process this yourself, but\u2026repeat this to yourself, over and over, and use it as a mantra: **This is not my news to share. This is not my story to tell.** \n\nLet your wife consider and process - and maybe even get a second opinion on the test results. In the meantime, keep your trap shut. That sounds mean, but this is *not* about you, so please don\u2019t even consider working this out verbally with anyone but your wife or a therapist.\n\nIf you even try to hint about it to a friend over drinks, and the news spreads before your wife is ready, you\u2019ll be the reason she has no control over her own situation when you\u2019re supposed to be her support. As tempted as you are, just stop.", "Ywbta she has the choice of living her final years how she pleases.  She also needs to process this news in her own way. Give her time!\n\nOnce she tells them, she has the load of worrying about their feelings and their reactions.  Give her the gift of respect in letting her process and letting her deal with the way she wants to.", "YWBTA  it is up to her to speak to her parents when she is ready.\n\nI'm sorry for what you are going through. Try a therapist or a trustworthy friend - as this is your trauma too. Just not her family - she needs your loyalty right now", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is your wife's medical information - and HER parents. It would be an ENORMOUS breach of trust if you wen against her wishes and told them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it would be even worse NOW, that she needs peace of mind and your support, not additional needyness from her parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you need someone to talk, find a therapist. Her parents are not suitable for that anyway.", "There are terminal diagnosis support groups for the patients and their families. OP can find one to talk to."]}
