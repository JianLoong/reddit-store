The hike was 24 miles total (12 in & 12 out), with the trail ending at a beautiful crystal blue lake. The trailhead was close to 3 hours from our home, so we woke up at 3:30 am to be sure we\u2019d get an early start. For those unfamiliar with overnight backpacking, the end of a hike typically has several established flat sites to pitch a tent; they are always first come first served and not reservable or numbered in any way. \n\nMy wife and I started the hike around 7:00 am and finished at 1:30 pm. We were surprised to find that we were the first ones to complete the hike, but more surprised to find that there were only 4 sites scattered around the lake. For a hike this long, it\u2019s not uncommon to find 8 or 9 sites at the end. Regardless, we were glad we had options and chose the first spot that sat directly in front of the lake. We wondered what might happen as other people started to trickle in. \n\nLo and behold, within the next hour a few other groups showed up and the remaining sites were claimed. Around 4pm, a group of 4 hikers arrived at the lake. At this point, my wife and I had been well established at our site, with our tent, cooking gear, and supplies spread out. The group of 4 hiked around the lake searching for spots and eventually returned to our site. They stood around for a few minutes before approaching us and asking if we could move our tent to share the space with them. Given the size of our site, their tents would have been no more than 6 feet from ours, and our otherwise private backpacking trip would have become a shared experience with strangers. We would have been cooking food together, gathering water together, and hearing each others conversations. Therefore, we politely declined, and suggested they check for sites at the lower lake about a mile and a half back. They were clearly displeased by our answer, and gave us the \u201cC\u2019mon man,\u201d routine. We again declined to share the site, at which point they became upset and insisted that we move our tent to make room for both of theirs.  They said it \u201cwasn\u2019t fair\u201d that we were capitalizing on the spot. We maintained our position and they ultimately left the lake.\n\nMy wife\u2019s and my backpacking philosophy has always been to set ourselves up for success by arriving early. The whole point of backpacking for us is to get away from social obligations and be in solitude. Are we the assholes?\n\nUpdate: I wanted to address a few things based on the comments. First, the hike was to Lake Dorothy in Snoqualmie WA for those inquiring. In addition, I failed to mentioned we also had our dog with us. Although she is very sweet and friendly, it was another element that deterred us from wanting to be around a large group. Lastly, we didn\u2019t have any concerns about being murdered (until after reading some of your scenarios!). Our biggest concern was the size of the group and their rather assertive request to have us move.

I\u2019ve been a Wilderness Ranger. People are definitely within their rights to enjoy the space they worked to get to on time.

You mentioned yourself that there was not enough space for everyone to stay, but based on the description, it appears that indeed was enough space, but you simply positioned your tent and equipment so that other tents could not fit. Yes, you get to pick the spot (eg the flattest one) first, but you should always think about the hikers who will come after you. You don\u2019t know how long they hiked and what are their circumstances. So, you should always assume there may be someone coming after you, and you should consider this while setting up your camp. The nature and public camp sites such as this are for everyone - they cannot be claimed for only one tent just because you arrived first. But maybe you are NTA according to the USA etiquette.\n\nEdit: 6ft between tents is 1.829 meters. Its is quite plenty of space between tents tbh. I was expecting about 20 cm.\n\nEdit 2: Wow!

A lot of backpackers like to share conversation with others on the trail-especially through hikers on long treks. OP was in-and-out hiker, so makes way more sense they just wanted the solitude. I was a Wilderness Ranger that would stay with people occasionally, if asked. It\u2019s nice to shoot the sh#t sometimes. But I also camped in isolated areas most of the time for some peace.\n\nMy guess is OP was on the prettiest, largest spot. Which is why it was the first to go.", "Most sites like this have specific tent pads. They aren\u2019t huge or anything. They\u2019re small areas with flat, firm surfaces. We use them to ensure that people aren\u2019t damaging the ecosystem and area for others. They are marked with specific boundaries. Most sites are made for 1-2 tents only unless they are a specified large group site. Groups sites often need to be reserved. So, even if they could fit all 3 tents, it would\u2019ve been a tight squeeze. Fine if you want to hang out with others, not if you want a nice evening with your significant other.", "While I don\u2019t know this specific site of course, this sounds like a site for just one party.

Yeah. I worked in the woods for years. Frontcountry people are way, way crazier than backcountry people. But you have to get out there to know that.

Certainly don't get upset at people there before you.  \n\n> Lots of people would ask this.\n\nNo.  They wouldn't.  I camp a lot.  If other sites heard someone asking this of another people would have banded together to get those people back on the trail to leave.   \n\nOnly people that shouldn't be there ask stuff like this.  They should be pushed out.  You don't disturb other campers.  Get there early or keep quiet when there's no spots.  \n\n> That being said, LMAO about your murder paranoia. \n\nThat statement shows you don't have any experience with this.  You have to be careful of who you're around and who you let near your site.  You make acquaintances with the sites nearby to make sure weirdos like that guy are known about and outnumbered.  \n\nIf you're seriously going to say you don't have situational awareness and you think it's fine to try to push your way into staying at a family's camp site....   how many people have you ruined camping trips for?

A plethora of weirdos there.", "Camping and backpacking are two very different things. Backpackers quite often share very small places for the night because the goal of the \"camping\" aspect is solely to get enough sleep to continue on the next morning. It's not camping like a family camping trip is. I'd wager the vast majority of thru hikers on the PCT or AT would have gladly shared their campsite with fellow weary backpackers.", "Lmao. You\u2019re obviously a car camper, not a backpacker. Not remotely the same thing.", "What \"THAT guy\"?! It was a group of four hikers, not one single man with an axe. You think there's roving gangs of FOUR MURDERERS who trick you into being murdered by.......getting to know you and setting up camp near you? Hahaha I can't with you. Seek help for your anxiety.", "Person you're responding to would probably wander off of a group of people matching outfits.", "Thank you. Honestly I didn't want to come out and say it, but ESH. I hate sharing and it would absolutely gut me to lose the privacy, but I would feel like a huge AH turning these people down (until they got snotty, at least).", "Am I the only one thinking that it doesn't matter if they shared the plot or not in the case of murderers? I mean they already know where you've set up so what's to stop them coming back in the middle of the night if that was their intention?", "This thread has been unexpectedly funny. You can definitely tell the people that have actually camped backcountry and who haven\u2019t.", "He has experience with getting murdered in the woods, its happened to him three times", "Oh you and your darned logic!", "Exactly right. You're way more at risk from someone who cases the joint, doesn't interact, and then \"leaves\".", "Literally my thoughts exactly haha", "\"I've camped a lot\" and \"the sites would band together and force them to leave!\" screams dude with an RV who elects himself the campground HOA for the weekend.", "Shoot, I should have been more thoughtful, I didn't consider how my comment could be triggering to people who have been murdered in the woods.", "Thrice", "Thru hiker here, and yeah, YTA. It's just bad etiquette. \n\nThere's definitely circumstances where more people won't fit, but it sounds like they definitely could have. You shouldn't expect privacy in a public, no reservation campsite. Plus all the people in the comments are paranoid. No one hikes 12 miles out into the woods with friends to find a couple to murder right next to three other full camp sites. \n\nIt's super normal to meet people on trails, and yes, eat with them and sleep near them and talk to them. It's entitled and unfriendly to not share campsites, especially when it means extra miles for other people.", "I dunno, its a tough one. Ive been on back country hikes plenty and its always been common practice to share. Im not saying yta yet but if you wanted privacy and seclusion you should have rented a private cabin. Its ppl like you who ruin it for everyone. Im gonna say esh cause the other couple shouldn't have argued but I'm sure there could be space found to accommodate.", "This seems to be an uncommon opinion but I think that YTA. You could have easily shifted your tent and hung out near the lake if you didn't want them hearing your conversations. I love meeting people on hikes and I think you could have been much kinder and perhaps even made some friends. You are in the beautiful wilderness and are worrying about petty thing like your tent being too close to someone else's tent. Why should someone else have to hike 12 miles out from the lake and not get to enjoy the experience because you didn't want to shift your tent? How would you feel if someone did this to you?", "YTA. It's common courtesy to be a little accommodating when resources are scarce. I'm a bit of an introvert, but making people walk another 1.5 miles is wild.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you had no formal right to the campsite, so you only won because they weren't dicks. There's no law stopping them from pitching the tent there anyways. I would have voted E-S-H in that case, but if you're winning a fight because the other party is nicer, you're probably not the good guy.", "Light Esh. Backcountry etiquette is a little more \"loose\" than RV camping. There's a nature is to be shared vibe, an embrace what is here mentality. That being said, when you politely declined once, they should have moved on without hassling you. If they were loud, music playing party people, I also would have declined. The likelyhood of having someone try to physically assault you in the backcountry is almost nil, so that shouldn't be a worry.", "NTA\n\nThis is how the Vorhees family finds their victims.", "Possibly. I don't know much about camping but I assume public sites like yours are meant to be shared. Since there were only two of you it would have made sense for you to take a smaller spot rather than a big spot or accept that you might have to share it.\n\nAfter asking you did they bother to ask some of the other campers to share their spot? Did you see other hikers sharing spots with later arrivals?", "I\u2019ve shared a spot under certain circumstances and have not in others, so it\u2019s hard to say. I would never insist if I was the one asking and they declined. I would find other options.  We\u2019re you in the north cascades by chance ?", "YTA for refusing to share a space. You saw there were not enough spots for everyone so the polite thing is to share your space with other campers.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get there early just to have them ruin the experience for you. If they want a good spot, they can set out earlier next time.", "Nta. You dont know these ppl, their habits (they could run around nude, be loud & obnoxious, drug addicts, etc). They could have just as easily walked to the other campsites & asked them, move to a different location or whatever. Its not on you.\n That said, had they not been so many, so pushy, etc. It could have made the trip fun too. But always trust your gut", "Why couldn't they ask some of the other people.", "NTA, tents six feet apart? No way.", "NTA, this nearly sounded like some horror movie shit\ud83d\ude2d, and you don't know them so you're right not to trust them and to tell them to move on.", "NTA guess they should have gotten there early then", "Jade Lake is truly beautiful. Did I nail it? \ud83d\ude43\n\nI'm not sure I can fully weigh in, due to missing details. Were other sites available around the lake and they just didn't like them (in which case N-T-A) or did they hike around the lake for 30min and find no open spots (in which case Y-T-A)? Were you in a single tent in a wide open spot that can fit 4+ tents (Y-T-A)? If I nailed it on the lake location, telling someone to scramble back down a rock chute after 12mi of hiking with a full pack is a bit unreasonable and, based on when you got there, I'm guessing you were camped in a spot that would easily fit more than one tent. The outdoors are for everyone and compromises can be made!", "But isn't saying no to the strangers and angering them the start of the horror movie, giving them a revenge motive?", "I thought that, too. It gets me that they didn't even bother asking any of the other sites. Only OP's.", "It\u2019s camping, if they wanted to stranger the danger it wouldn\u2019t be hard.", "I'm surprised the lots are so small to be honest, that only 4 sites are available around a whole lake. Where I'm from marked camp sites are usually very large (like room for 50 tents) or it's unmarked camping (with a permit) and you setup anywhere.", "Good boy!", "I agree, was surprised about so many people expecting murderers. Im glad in my region etiquette is different. Would be crazy to wake up at 3 am to start a hiking earlier to get a spot at all in the camping area. Im wondering if the post was in some sub-Reddit dedicated to backpacking and hiking the responses would gave been different.", "Eh, as a former spike crew leader and backpacker myself, I disagree. They weren't in a thru hike situation, this was in-and-out camping at what sounds like a high demand spot. Spots being full, especially the nicest lakefront one, is an assumed risk of that sort of camping. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\n\nIf they were at a hut/lean-to or thru hiking, sure they would be a jerk. But it's much more entitled to arrive that late in the day and repeatedly push campers who understand how it works to share the best site with them.\n\nPart of in-and-out camping is having a plan for this exact scenario, and an extra mile and a half back on a single 12 mile day is not that much further. If they were so worried about the extra miles they could have asked the other parties who weren't lakefront, or they could have gotten there earlier.\n\nAgreed that the murder fears are ridiculous, though.", "I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve been hiking since I was a kid. Claiming dibs on nature has never been a thing. If you want reservation and privacy, get a hotel room.", "Why should OP and his wife get up early and hike the 12 miles just to have their peace and solitude ruined by crowding the tent site with another group of campers? The point of such a secluded place is that you're **not** on top of a bunch of other campers. Plus OP probably wanted to go to bed early, and who knows if this group of 4 friends will be up all night talking loudly 5 feet from their heads.", "It\u2019s not **their** campsite though.", "Probably because op and their partner were only a camp of two. Reckon the others were probably larger parties.", "If this is the location I think it is (Jade Lake in the alpine lakes wilderness of WA), there are extremely limited sites and putting your tent in a non-proper campsite would be a massive no-no. Much of the area is marked with signs to stay off the fragile alpine plants to allow restoration.", "You don't have to disassemble a tent to move it", "All the talk of murderers is ridiculous, people\u2019s brains are absolutely rotted by true crime. The odds of getting murdered in this situation are vanishingly tiny, but if someone actually wanted to murder you, being told \u201cnah, set up camp somewhere else\u201d isn\u2019t going to stop them.", "Yea, this was what I thought too, as an old trail crew leader. I've shared spots plenty of times and there are certain situations where it's proper etiquette, but in this case it just sounds like the other hikers wanted the lake front spot after snoozing and losing.", "You\u2019re not supposed to put more than one tent on a backpacking pad where I\u2019m from or you\u2019ll get fined.", "Why?

Or you know, picking the smallest of the 4 sites on the lake", "Or hit up BLM land where you don't have to camp in designated campgrounds.", "That is my understanding too but i wonder if there is a knife proof tent available? if not, someone needs to come up with it.", "The PCT and AT are very different than an out and back", "Eh, most of the permitted options are pretty crowded IME (that's why they require permits!).  I mean, it depends on the site, but generally you're not going to get a lot of solitude on, say, the Wonderland Trail or the Enchantments or Cascade Pass. (At least not compared with some lesser known areas in National Forest that don't require permits.)\n\nI do agree that if OP wanted the full site to himself/herself, he/she should have picked the smallest of the sites.", "Socks with sandals are an absolute dream after a day of backpacking amd I am willing to fight about it.", "YTA for OP too, because they just left the freaking place after doing a good hard work, OP could have made their day but OP just choses to not give them any good space there.", "They should learn some more normal etiquette to be better hikers.", "They really hiked a lot and they didn't even get the place, that was bad.", "Dude hiking is completely different, you should think like that.", "Yep. In the post OP says they can pitch all tents and gear and still have 6+ feet separation. Considering one of the groups is 4 people, which is either 2/3 tents or a very large tent, that\u2019s a huge site.\n\nObviously sharing isn\u2019t first choice, but this is obviously not a site sized for a single 2p tent", "It was not Jade Lake, but I\u2019ll have to put that one on my to do list! We hiked up to Lake Dorothy in Snoqualmie. But, similar to your description, it was dirt pads with vegetation surrounding. Needless to say, it would have been crammed with four additional people we did not know.", "Spot on.  I think this is the normal in the PNW also.  You help out when you can and don\u2019t take more than you need.  12 mile overnight puts people in a different category than 3mile day hikers.  In fact you would think it would put you in a place with like minded people.  Op is the AH.", "Yeh, id be choked too if I showed up just past the crack of dawn to find everything taken and no one sharing. Like i cant imagine the people asking to share are super happy about the arrangements either but it is what it is when youre 10+ k into the bush. And to expect/demand privacy in a public use campground is honestly just ridiculous. I dunno, some of my best camping experiences have come from 'having to share' so maybe im bias about it but it seems wild to just snatch up a whole space that sounds like its actually a double space, for 'privacy and seclusion'. Like bro, get a room \ud83e\udd23", ">well demarcated and it belongs to the group that\u2019s on it.\n\nThe sites are not numbered and \"In no way reservable\" clearly belongs to everyone.", ">life's chemical treasures\n\n\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nThis is how I will be referring to all drugs now and forever.", "Ikr? Like OP was out there to enjoy nature, as was everyone else. They may have preferred solitude, but if you're on a public site that's fairly popular, you're not guaranteed that. If they wanted privacy they should've gotten a hotel room somewhere or hiked an area that offered private cabins or something.", "\ud83d\ude33", "omg, I was going to share this too! Delia is my favorite podcast host.", "I appreciate the insight of an experienced hiker. But you also have to remember that not everyone is that experienced. A mile and a half can feel like a lot to someone who isn't used to hiking all the time. Even if it meant I'd have to hike less distance the following day, I'd be very unhappy if someone added an additional mile and a half to my hike when I was already tired at the end of a long day.", "This is the equivalent of putting your backpack on the seat next to you on the bus because you are worried someone might sit next to you and try to start a conversation. The motivation is understandable but it's still a clear asshole move. Your right to quiet solitude does not trump other's right to enjoy the same public spaces as you. And if they bust out a bluetooth speaker you can always just ask them to turn it off.", "Exactly this. 4 vs 2, OP and wife would\u2019ve been overtaken quickly.", "The get there early idea is pure lazy horse manure.  \nI try to get my 11 year old daughter backpacking\u2026but there are other obligations that often prevent us from leaving at 3am (soccer game at 9am) for example.\n\nEarly birds do not own the lake, own the outdoors, and this is not maintained on a reservation basis, I\u2019m not really down with the hoarding mentality.\n\nBackpacking is an outdoor activity, often with limited viable options of where camp can be set up.  Depending on where other viable options to camp exist and how much further they have to move further or back, major AH vibes from OP", "Backcountry camping is like this. First come first serve. You can ask, but be prepares to hear no. Also people do this to get away from others. \n\nWe who do it, know if you want good spots you start early and move it."]}
