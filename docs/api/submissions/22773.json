The hike was 24 miles total (12 in & 12 out), with the trail ending at a beautiful crystal blue lake. The trailhead was close to 3 hours from our home, so we woke up at 3:30 am to be sure we\u2019d get an early start. For those unfamiliar with overnight backpacking, the end of a hike typically has several established flat sites to pitch a tent; they are always first come first served and not reservable or numbered in any way. \n\nMy wife and I started the hike around 7:00 am and finished at 1:30 pm. We were surprised to find that we were the first ones to complete the hike, but more surprised to find that there were only 4 sites scattered around the lake. For a hike this long, it\u2019s not uncommon to find 8 or 9 sites at the end. Regardless, we were glad we had options and chose the first spot that sat directly in front of the lake. We wondered what might happen as other people started to trickle in. \n\nLo and behold, within the next hour a few other groups showed up and the remaining sites were claimed. Around 4pm, a group of 4 hikers arrived at the lake. At this point, my wife and I had been well established at our site, with our tent, cooking gear, and supplies spread out. The group of 4 hiked around the lake searching for spots and eventually returned to our site. They stood around for a few minutes before approaching us and asking if we could move our tent to share the space with them. Given the size of our site, their tents would have been no more than 6 feet from ours, and our otherwise private backpacking trip would have become a shared experience with strangers. We would have been cooking food together, gathering water together, and hearing each others conversations. Therefore, we politely declined, and suggested they check for sites at the lower lake about a mile and a half back. They were clearly displeased by our answer, and gave us the \u201cC\u2019mon man,\u201d routine. We again declined to share the site, at which point they became upset and insisted that we move our tent to make room for both of theirs.  They said it \u201cwasn\u2019t fair\u201d that we were capitalizing on the spot. We maintained our position and they ultimately left the lake.\n\nMy wife\u2019s and my backpacking philosophy has always been to set ourselves up for success by arriving early.

I\u2019ve been a Wilderness Ranger. People are definitely within their rights to enjoy the space they worked to get to on time.

You mentioned yourself that there was not enough space for everyone to stay, but based on the description, it appears that indeed was enough space, but you simply positioned your tent and equipment so that other tents could not fit. Yes, you get to pick the spot (eg the flattest one) first, but you should always think about the hikers who will come after you. You don\u2019t know how long they hiked and what are their circumstances. So, you should always assume there may be someone coming after you, and you should consider this while setting up your camp. The nature and public camp sites such as this are for everyone - they cannot be claimed for only one tent just because you arrived first. But maybe you are NTA according to the USA etiquette.\n\nEdit: 6ft between tents is 1,829 meters. Its is quite plenty of space between tents tbh. I was expecting about 20 cm.\n\nEdit 2: Wow!

A lot of backpackers like to share conversation with others on the trail-especially through hikers on long treks. OP was in-and-out hiker, so makes way more sense they just wanted the solitude. I was a Wilderness Ranger that would stay with people occasionally, if asked. It\u2019s nice to shoot the sh#t sometimes. But I also camped in isolated areas most of the time for some peace.\n\nMy guess is OP was on the prettiest, largest spot. Which is why it was the first to go.", "Most sites like this have specific tent pads. They aren\u2019t huge or anything. They\u2019re small areas with flat, firm surfaces. We use them to ensure that people aren\u2019t damaging the ecosystem and area for others. They are marked with specific boundaries. Most sites are made for 1-2 tents only unless they are a specified large group site. Groups sites often need to be reserved. So, even if they could fit all 3 tents, it would\u2019ve been a tight squeeze. Fine if you want to hang out with others, not if you want a nice evening with your significant other.", "While I don\u2019t know this specific site of course, this sounds like a site for just one party.

Yeah. I worked in the woods for years. Frontcountry people are way, way crazier than backcountry people. But you have to get out there to know that. I\u2019ve always said once you hike in at least 8 miles, you leave the real insanity behind.", "> After hiking fifteen miles with no other options?\n\nYep.  Get there earlier or don't complain.  Certainly don't get upset at people there before you.  \n\n> Lots of people would ask this.\n\nNo.  They wouldn't.  I camp a lot.  If other sites heard someone asking this of another people would have banded together to get those people back on the trail to leave.   \n\nOnly people that shouldn't be there ask stuff like this.  They should be pushed out.  You don't disturb other campers.  Get there early or keep quiet when there's no spots.  \n\n> That being said, LMAO about your murder paranoia. \n\nThat statement shows you don't have any experience with this.  You have to be careful of who you're around and who you let near your site.  You make acquaintances with the sites nearby to make sure weirdos like that guy are known about and outnumbered.  \n\nIf you're seriously going to say you don't have situational awareness and you think it's fine to try to push your way into staying at a family's camp site....   how many people have you ruined camping trips for?

A plethora of weirdos there.", "Camping and backpacking are two very different things. Backpackers quite often share very small places for the night because the goal of the \"camping\" aspect is solely to get enough sleep to continue on the next morning. It's not camping like a family camping trip is. I'd wager the vast majority of thru hikers on the PCT or AT would have gladly shared their campsite with fellow weary backpackers.", "Lmao. You\u2019re obviously a car camper, not a backpacker. Not remotely the same thing.", "What \"THAT guy\"?! It was a group of four hikers, not one single man with an axe. You think there's roving gangs of FOUR MURDERERS who trick you into being murdered by.......getting to know you and setting up camp near you? Hahaha I can't with you.

I hate sharing and it would absolutely gut me to lose the privacy, but I would feel like a huge AH turning these people down (until they got snotty, at least).", "Am I the only one thinking that it doesn't matter if they shared the plot or not in the case of murderers? I mean they already know where you've set up so what's to stop them coming back in the middle of the night if that was their intention?", "This thread has been unexpectedly funny. You can definitely tell the people that have actually camped backcountry and who haven\u2019t.", "He has experience with getting murdered in the woods, its happened to him three times", "Oh you and your darned logic!", "Exactly right. You're way more at risk from someone who cases the joint, doesn't interact, and then \"leaves\".", "Literally my thoughts exactly haha", "\"I've camped a lot\" and \"the sites would band together and force them to leave!\" screams dude with an RV who elects himself the campground HOA for the weekend.", "Shoot, I should have been more thoughtful, I didn't consider how my comment could be triggering to people who have been murdered in the woods.", "Thrice", "Thru hiker here, and yeah, YTA. It's just bad etiquette. \n\nThere's definitely circumstances where more people won't fit, but it sounds like they definitely could have. You shouldn't expect privacy in a public, no reservation campsite. Plus all the people in the comments are paranoid. No one hikes 12 miles out into the woods with friends to find a couple to murder right next to three other full camp sites. \n\nIt's super normal to meet people on trails, and yes, eat with them and sleep near them and talk to them. It's entitled and unfriendly to not share campsites, especially when it means extra miles for other people.", "I dunno, its a tough one. Ive been on back country hikes plenty and its always been common practice to share. Im not saying yta yet but if you wanted privacy and seclusion you should have rented a private cabin. Its ppl like you who ruin it for everyone. Im gonna say esh cause the other couple shouldn't have argued but I'm sure there could be space found to accommodate.", "This seems to be an uncommon opinion but I think that YTA. You could have easily shifted your tent and hung out near the lake if you didn't want them hearing your conversations. I love meeting people on hikes and I think you could have been much kinder and perhaps even made some friends. You are in the beautiful wilderness and are worrying about petty thing like your tent being too close to someone else's tent. Why should someone else have to hike 12 miles out from the lake and not get to enjoy the experience because you didn't want to shift your tent? How would you feel if someone did this to you?", "YTA. It's common courtesy to be a little accommodating when resources are scarce. I'm a bit of an introvert, but making people walk another 1.5 miles is wild.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you had no formal right to the campsite, so you only won because they weren't dicks. There's no law stopping them from pitching the tent there anyways. I would have voted E-S-H in that case, but if you're winning a fight because the other party is nicer, you're probably not the good guy.", "Light Esh. Backcountry etiquette is a little more \"loose\" than RV camping. There's a nature is to be shared vibe, an embrace what is here mentality. That being said, when you politely declined once, they should have moved on without hassling you. If they were loud, music playing party people, I also would have declined. The likelyhood of having someone try to physically assault you in the backcountry is almost nil, so that shouldn't be a worry.", "NTA\n\nThis is how the Vorhees family finds their victims.", "Possibly. I don't know much about camping but I assume public sites like yours are meant to be shared. Since there were only two of you it would have made sense for you to take a smaller spot rather than a big spot or accept that you might have to share it.\n\nAfter asking you did they bother to ask some of the other campers to share their spot? Did you see other hikers sharing spots with later arrivals?", "I\u2019ve shared a spot under certain circumstances and have not in others, so it\u2019s hard to say. I would never insist if I was the one asking and they declined. I would find other options.  We\u2019re you in the north cascades by chance ?", "YTA for refusing to share a space. You saw there were not enough spots for everyone so the polite thing is to share your space with other campers.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get there early just to have them ruin the experience for you. If they want a good spot, they can set out earlier next time.", "Nta. You dont know these ppl, their habits (they could run around nude, be loud & obnoxious, drug addicts, etc). They could have just as easily walked to the other campsites & asked them, move to a different location or whatever. Its not on you.\n That said, had they not been so many, so pushy, etc. It could have made the trip fun too. But always trust your gut", "Why couldn't they ask some of the other people.", "NTA, tents six feet apart? No way.", "NTA, this nearly sounded like some horror movie shit\ud83d\ude2d, and you don't know them so you're right not to trust them and to tell them to move on.", "NTA guess they should have gotten there early then", "Jade Lake is truly beautiful. Did I nail it? \ud83d\ude43\n\nI'm not sure I can fully weigh in, due to missing details. Were other sites available around the lake and they just didn't like them (in which case N-T-A) or did they hike around the lake for 30min and find no open spots (in which case Y-T-A)? Were you in a single tent in a wide open spot that can fit 4+ tents (Y-T-A)? If I nailed it on the lake location, telling someone to scramble back down a rock chute after 12mi of hiking with a full pack is a bit unreasonable and, based on when you got there, I'm guessing you were camped in a spot that would easily fit more than one tent. The outdoors are for everyone and compromises can be made!", "But isn't saying no to the strangers and angering them the start of the horror movie, giving them a revenge motive?", "I thought that, too. It gets me that they didn't even bother asking any of the other sites. Only OP's.", "It\u2019s camping, if they wanted to stranger the danger it wouldn\u2019t be hard.", "I'm surprised the lots are so small to be honest, that only 4 sites are available around a whole lake. Where I'm from marked camp sites are usually very large (like room for 50 tents) or it's unmarked camping (with a permit) and you setup anywhere.", "Good boy!", "I agree, was surprised about so many people expecting murderers. Im glad in my region etiquette is different. Would be crazy to wake up at 3 am to start a hiking earlier to get a spot at all in the camping area. Im wondering if the post was in some sub-Reddit dedicated to backpacking and hiking the responses would gave been different.", "Eh, as a former spike crew leader and backpacker myself, I disagree. They weren't in a thru hike situation, this was in-and-out camping at what sounds like a high demand spot. Spots being full, especially the nicest lakefront one, is an assumed risk of that sort of camping. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\n\nIf they were at a hut/lean-to or thru hiking, sure they would be a jerk. But it's much more entitled to arrive late to the party and repeatedly push campers who understand how it works to share the best site with them.\n\nPart of in-and-out camping is having a plan for this exact scenario, and an extra mile and a half back on a single 12 mile day is not that much further. If they were so worried about the extra miles they could have asked the other parties who weren't lakefront, or they could have gotten there earlier.\n\nAgreed that the murder fears are ridiculous, though.", "I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve been hiking since I was a kid. Claiming dibs on nature has never been a thing. If you want reservation and privacy, get a hotel room.", "Why should OP and his wife get up early and hike the 12 miles just to have their peace and solitude ruined by crowding the tent site with another group of campers? The point of such a secluded place is that you're **not** on top of a bunch of other campers. Plus OP probably wanted to go to bed early, and who knows if this group of 4 friends will be up all night talking loudly 5 feet from their heads.", "It\u2019s not **their** campsite though.", "Probably because op and their partner were only a camp of two. Reckon the others were probably larger parties.", "If this is the location I think it is (Jade Lake in the alpine lakes wilderness of WA), there are extremely limited sites and putting your tent in a non-proper campsite would be a massive no-no. Much of the area is marked with signs to stay off the fragile alpine plants to allow restoration.", "You don't have to disassemble a tent to move it", "All the talk of murderers is ridiculous, people\u2019s brains are absolutely rotted by true crime. The odds of getting murdered in this situation are vanishingly tiny, but if someone actually wanted to murder you, being told \u201cnah, set up camp somewhere else\u201d isn\u2019t going to stop them.", "Yea, this was what I thought too, as an old trail crew leader. I've shared spots plenty of times and there are certain situations where it's proper etiquette, but in this case it just sounds like the other hikers wanted the lake front spot after snoozing and losing.", "You\u2019re not supposed to put more than one tent on a backpacking pad where I\u2019m from or you\u2019ll get fined.", "Why? Because it's the common etiquette. The outdoor community usually prides itself being helpful und supportive. Not being self centred, \"me first\", \"but muh rights\".\n\nAnyone who gets up in the middle of the night for a longer hike should usually know this.", "1. Stranger murders almost never happen statistically. Stop watching true crime.\n2. Are they trying to prevent a murder from a 80 year old man?

You don't push a bunch of tired fellow hikers out to stumble their way around in the dark.", "From people who have no idea what a 12 mile hike into the backcountry even looks like.", "Check out the pictures on [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1557xjh/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_campsite_with/jsud06r/). Describing it as a \"spot being full\" is stretching the truth. Edit: also, it's 24 miles", "People are taking the \"murderers\" comments way too literally. It's just a simplified way of saying other people. A crazy scenario that's not 0.0%. It's just phrasing people use. The other people could be... smokers, could be drinkers, could be staying up hours after the other party wanted to get to sleep. They could be annoying. They could be mooches, \"wow that food looks good\", \"darn we didn't bring enough water\", maybe you brought your 5k in camera equipment and having strangers in your buffer zone 2 feet away from thousands of dollars in gear isn't appealing. Etc etc etc etc. There's no need to cover every single scenario. It's just a catch-all phrase. Way too many comments focusing on \"murderers\" when it's just a phrase that covers all scenarios. Generally you understand the jist of what people mean, you'd assume almost nobody that says that is sitting there constantly worrying about being murdered", "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f", "Yeah but surely even if you're that insistent on solitude you're not going to select the most amazing spot that's big enough for 3/4 tents and meant to be shared and hope nobody else needs it? I like the solitude too...so I'd enjoy the lake view but select a spot that's more private.", "You\u2019re allowed to go out into the woods and camp - if you camp at the site you should be prepared to share.", "YTA\n\nBut perhaps this is a cultural thing? I come from a small country with a strong outdoorsy mentality and a shared campsite means a shared campsite. You'd absolutely be seen as the dick for doing this. \n\n>there will be government owned huts or camp grounds or whatever that everyone will congregate at because it's a logical stopping point for the day.\n\nI remember sharing a 8 bed hut with 24 people once. Someone slept in the wood shed, and two pitched a tent outside, it was definitely cosy. There was two bunk beds with foam mattress lining each floor, and the guy sleeping next to me was close enough that I didn't need to stretch at all to gently bump him to stop snoring. It was also first in first served, so no reservation system, and a public holiday. The only person that complained and wanted others who came after her to move on was American. You guys need to learn how to share, or like, sort out your casual use of deadly weapons.", "Ooof people who have obviously never backpacked", "Well, they could've also not been assholes from the start and pitch their tent in such a way that the space could accommodate more people. It's a public camp site.", "Because this is what we do as hikers. Everyone is exhausted after a hike that long. They should have been willing to share space with fellow hikers.", "If you want to be completely alone, I\u2019d suggest not going on what seems like a popular trail. This is not a campsite and trail etiquette where I live typically dictates that you can be clustered pretty close if all end up at a popular outdoor spot", "I think it does. If it is night and there is no other place to put the tent.", "I think you need to watch horror past 1982.\n\nIn modern (or, hell, early 2000s on) horror, turning down a strangers request is EXACTLY how a long stalking/hunting horror starts.", "Honestly, the second type is a little more polite. At least you can have a good conversation before getting murdered and having your eyeballs taken as a trophy.", "I'm sorry, do you think that anyone goes \"I'd love to murder some hikers today, but their tent is 20 meters away instead of 10, too much effort. I guess I'll do my murdering some other day!\"?", "Nothing to do with murder, everything with privacy. They hiked out there to be alone with each other, probably take off their pants a bit.. Don't want a bunch of randos that close. I totally get it, I wouldn't want that either. They were late, they're a lot of people, they can go to the other spot,that happens to also have a lake at the site.", "Dude what?? They\u2019re not there to murder they\u2019re looking for a spot to sleep after a full day of hiking. There are many \u201ccampsites\u201d along the Appalachian trail where multiple groups might have to share.", "Has op confirmed that was the spot?  Cause until then it's just what someone guessed the spot was.", "You'd think so, but I've worked in outdoor rec long enough to know there are actually people who think like this despite how much safer you are in the backcountry than walking around in everyday life. Watched too many 80s horror films, I guess.", "I agree with your YTA point. No need to start on the gun control debate here though. \n\nSigned: Someone in the UK who also understands shared campsites.", "Completely agree. I\u2019m from Europe and I once shared 12 bed hut with 24 people and few more people outside in 3 tents. Mind you, there are no beds in that hut, just one long wooden bench that can accomodate 12 or so people. If they wanted privacy they should\u2019ve gone for some sort of glamping.", "What kind of tent? It\u2019s staked o to the ground.. the poles fall in when you do that.. you have to remove all your belongings.. did they make up their beds or bags inside? YES YOU DO.. it\u2019s a lot of work to move a tent you don\u2019t just pick it up .. at minimum you\u2019re loving your whole damn camp even of it 5 feet it\u2019s a ton of work", "This culture is exactly what got me into backpacking and hiking. Being nice and relying that others will not be a dick to you when you need help (because so many things can go wrong during backpacking). I always wanted to explore the USA nature but I guess the etiquette is very different and more like first come first serve basis (which is a bit sad tbh).", "I dare say you are correct. I may well be out of touch with Modern Murdering. \n\nBut if turning down a request kicks off the murdering what are you supposed to do? Just go along with the murderers and let them set up camp next to you?", "I was going to say -- nothing would happen during the camping experience in a horror movie scenario like this, but the long game here would be the draw haha", "No, but the post seems pretty specific (blue lake, PNW, good view, 24 miles in two sections, 1.5 miles to the next spot)\n\nEdit: what difference would it make to your judgment? The picture matches everything the OP posted (can't reserve positions, they aren't marked or numbered, and you aren't allowed to camp on vegetation). OP only said they would be able to hear the other campers, he didn't say it would be crowded or there wouldn't be enough space.", "So they just put up their tent in a bad way then to prevent others from camping?", "Is it really being a dick if you just don\u2019t want to spend the time you planned for solitude with a bunch of strangers? I\u2019m so confused bc I\u2019ve been backpacking for years and I\u2019ve never heard this. I\u2019ve only been approached a couple of times, but I think they maybe just wanted to hang out, but regardless I just say no thanks and they were all super nice about it.", ">That statement shows you don't have any experience with this. \n\nSorry, were you murdered on your hike?", "> If other sites heard someone asking this of another people would have banded together to get those people back on the trail to leave.\n\nThe fuck they would. This tells me you\u2019ve NEVER done significant trail camping because this is *the exact opposite* of what would happen. It would be incredibly irresponsible and dangerous to do so.\n\nStick to glamping, you\u2019ve got the attitude for it.", "No? OP said it\u2019s a pitch that only has proper space for one tent or a small group that can camp on top of each other. There is not enough space for strangers to share.", "Yes it is.", "If you want solitude, then you pick somewhere that doesn't have limited sites and is popular.\n\nThats the tradeoff.", "It\u2019s an AH situation bc the other solution is that they hike back 12 miles. Even I can tell if you have space and without it people have to hike back 12 miles and not camp that it\u2019s an AH move. I don\u2019t hike that regularly, but I\u2019ve got a buddy who did the AT and most backpackers are pretty friendly bc they realize stuff happens.", "Right?!? Even *then* though\u2026 the absolute toxicity. Most car campers I know are WAY better behaved than they suggest being.", "It's true, I was the axe the last 2 times", "I agree with you! Because if the tent was in the first place placed inappropriately, moving it (disassembling it is IMHO much more effort and move just require two people and 5 min) is warranted.", "Tbf I am shocked at all your downvotes. Like, you\u2019re not wrong, you\u2019re just being picky. Redditors love to pile on!", "Yes but compared to a site that already has 2 tents, even a small space with 1 tent has more room.", "Also, would be the AH if all other sites were packed full of people and sharing one was the only option"]}
