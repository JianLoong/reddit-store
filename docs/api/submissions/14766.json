Dad's wife was a widow and she had three kids when she married dad. A son who is a year younger than me and two daughter's who were 3 and 4 years younger than me.

Honestly, it wouldn't upset me if they chose not to come.\n\nMy dad and stepmom were upset to learn none of my stepsiblings were given a place in the wedding party. My stepbrother not being a groomsman was especially upsetting because I am the groom and they believe I should want all three of them, because they see the four of us as four brothers, and believe I should want all my brothers there. They have also mentioned since Elle is having a friend, we could have had an even wedding party if she had my stepsisters instead of her friend as bridesmaids.\n\nI don't know how my stepsiblings feel because I do not talk to them.\n\nMy dad asked me to reconsider the wedding party a couple of times. I always said no. My stepmom recently told me it is not too late and I could show a united front and be on the way to making us all closer if I include them. She said we have known each other since childhood and have more than fifteen years of life as a family to want them included in my special moment. I said I didn't want to include them that way.\n\nShe told me I was behaving unforgivably for not making my stepsiblings part of my wedding party and she told me she hopes I regret it in years to come.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681464718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lr7ii/aita_for_not_making_my_stepsiblings_part_of_the/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
