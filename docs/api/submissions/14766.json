Dad's wife was a widow and she had three kids when she married dad. A son who is a year younger than me and two daughter's who were 3 and 4 years younger than me.

Honestly, it wouldn't upset me if they chose not to come.\n\nMy dad and stepmom were upset to learn none of my stepsiblings were given a place in the wedding party. My stepbrother not being a groomsman was especially upsetting because I am the groom and they believe I should want all three of them, because they see the four of us as four brothers, and believe I should want all my brothers there. They have also mentioned since Elle is having a friend, we could have had an even wedding party if she had my stepsisters instead of her friend as bridesmaids.\n\nI don't know how my stepsiblings feel because I do not talk to them.\n\nMy dad asked me to reconsider the wedding party a couple of times. I always said no. My stepmom recently told me it is not too late and I could show a united front and be on the way to making us all closer if I include them. She said we have known each other since childhood and have more than fifteen years of life as a family to want them included in my special moment. I said I didn't want to include them that way.\n\nShe told me I was behaving unforgivably for not making my stepsiblings part of my wedding party and she told me she hopes I regret it in years to come.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681464718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lr7ii/aita_for_not_making_my_stepsiblings_part_of_the/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sick of this kind of thing. Someone else wants to make decisions that aren't theirs. This would all be pretence, and for what? So they can project a fantasy for the rest of the world.", "NTA \n\nHonestly I would talk to your step siblings. \n\nThey see you once a year. They don\u2019t make an effort to see you more. I bet they don\u2019t actually care. \n\nAll six of you can tell your parents they are acting unglued!", "NTA!   The wedding party are those special people in your life who have accepted your request to stand with you at your wedding.  No one has any say on that except you and your fianc\u00e9e.  \n\nIf your SM wants to see the four of you as brothers, then make sure you get a picture taken with them.", "NTA\n\nYou are not close to them and you do not want to have them in the wedding or playing a bigger role. That's fine. Not every blended family is a super close nuclear family. Not every bio sibling is close enough to be more than a regular guest. As someone who technically has stepsiblings, though with a different dynamic, yeah, we're not close and we didn't even invite each other to our weddings.", "NTA- your dad and stepmom sure have audacity, I'll give them that! Trying to talk your kid into changing their side of the wedding party is ballsy as is, but asking that your wife kick out a friend for step siblings she probably wouldn't be able to pick out from a crowd??? What on earth are they thinking????", "NTA. This is your wedding. They may be step siblings, but they are practically strangers.

Your wedding represents a threat to their beliefs so they want to force a false narrative onto it.\n\nI also doubt your step-siblings would want to be in your wedding parties if they see you so little, it doesn't sound like there is a relationship there.", "NTA \n\nNo is a complete answer. The cheek of your stepmother to insist your bride has her daughters as her attendants instead of her best friend!\n\nI don't understand the need to have siblings in your wedding party, it's not the tradition in my country and I've not had a role in any of my 3 brothers weddings.  Shut the talk down by hinting you will rescind their own invitations if they don't stop harping on about it.", "NTA- You will not regret keeping your step-siblings out of the wedding party. Your father and stepmother seem delusional. \n\nMaybe reach out to one of your step-siblings and \u201capologize\u201d for not having them in the wedding party. Maybe they will be as confused by it as you are and get their mother to back off.", "NTA. It's your wedding and you& your fiance' get to decide who is in the wedding party and who are invited guests. \"Steps\" ALWAYS think they can replace a deceased family member (I also lost my mom at a very young age and have a step who is an AH, but that's another story), and they just don't. Your steps should all be happy for you and leave it at that, but this isn't their wedding. Hold your ground, bro. Nothing brings out the drama like weddings and funerals.", "NTA unless they are footing the bill they get 0 say in any part of the wedding. They don't get to decide how close you are to people and they don't get to overrule decisions you've already made. They aren't the AH for asking if you would involve them but they are the AH for not dropping it after you told them no the first time", "NTA.\n\nOP like you said they are not really in your adult life to warrant them to be apart of the wedding party, an invite should be good enough for them and to expect anymore someone who life they chose not to be apart of is ridicules.", "NTA-your parents are wrong. Unfortunately for you, they don\u2019t know that. But please do not go so far as to ask your fianc\u00e9 to reconsider her choices. Your parents have a lot of audacity to even suggest that she change her wedding party.", "NTA\n\nBut this is a good indicator of who is the AH and why you have a poor relationship with your step-siblings, 'she told me she hopes I regret it in years to come'. \n\nSeriously, this woman is toxic.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not close to them, they\u2019re also not involved in your adult life. You won\u2019t regret this.", "NTA. I hope your stepmom has the future she deserves.", "NTA Your wedding your choice. You should have only the people who are close to you in your wedding. Not the people who are close to your father and stepmother. If they're that adamant about it they can have their own wedding. As far as your stepmother tell her to go blow it out her other end.", "NTA your wedding, your choice.  I never get the sense of entitlement from others when the situation doesn't pertain to them.", "Contact your step siblings and apologise for not including them. You don't see them often and didn't think they would be bothered, but now that you know they are devastated by the omission you don't want to emotionally scar them for life. \n\nI bet they will be shocked to hear they care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
