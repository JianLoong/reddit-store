Earlier today my wife was craving food from one of her new favorite restaurants across town, roughly a 20 minute drive from our house. So I called and placed an order for carry out and was told food wood be ready in 25 minutes. It is a small African restaurant that we have been to a couple of times. To be honest they are not very organized, with food not be timely and orders getting messed up because of communication errors. The owners are generally nice so we have been coming back. Plus they need the business as it is mostly empty, but the food is very good.\n\nMy wife and I arrived after about 35 minutes later to pickup our food. When we went in the usual owner was not there and instead two family members who were helping cook. They went to collect our food and everything looked very good. The issue came when it was time to pay. No one knew how to operate the card reader except the owner owner. They said they could take cash, which we did not have. This was not mentioned on the phone and our nearest ATM without fee was a 10 minute drive each way. They explained the owner had left to pick up her young daughter and would be back soon. They even called her and put her on speaker saying that she would return in the next 7 minutes. My wife and I waited exactly 20 minutes after this conversation and decided to leave as she had not returned. As we were leaving one of the family members tried to stop us saying the owner was close, but we said that it had by this point been over an hour since ordering and we would not wait any longer. As we were driving out of the lot we saw the owner pulling in, but at this point we had already left and didn\u2019t want to deal with an awkward situation. I could see them trying to get us to come back as we drive away. We could have turned around, but we were mad after the owner was so late after assuring us just 7 minutes and we also thought it would be really awkward after driving away.

They need to be more organized if they want to stay in business. After all that wait, the food would have been cold anyway.", "It think you're getting a lot more Y T As than you deserve bc the post is confusing, it can read like you were 35 min late instead of just ten, and took the food without paying. \n\nNTA arriving 10 minutes after the estimated ready time isn't late to pick it up, when it's your own food. The restaurant knows you're coming and doesn't have anyone there ready to check you out, you waited let's say 25 minutes to pay them, and then at that point decided you were done with the wait, and the restaurant. That's your right. They really are going to need to get it together in general bc the restaurant business is brutal even when your service is on point. It's a basic thing to make sure someone is always available to ring customers up, or you lose sales unfortunately. Maybe give them a second chance though", "Hey, folks, \"late\" to pickup carryout doesn't really mean anything.  They say \"it'll be ready in 20 minutes\" and when it's done they put it in a bag and sit it there while they move on.  They aren't taking up a reservation or something.  So no, OP is not TA for being \"late\".\n\nNTA.  Could you have gone back in at that point?  Yes.  But \"how the credit card machine works\" is insanely basic to the operation of a modern business.  If you're the only one who can operate it, don't leave it unattended.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault that their card machine wasn\u2019t working. You were already very obliging by waiting 20 minutes. Tbh I wouldn\u2019t even have agreed to wait the 7 minutes.", "NTA - because you didn't take the food. You ordered, waited an hour and then left... It certainly sucks for the restaurant that they prepared food that wasn't needed, but that's not your fault.", "NTA. You waited a lot longer than I would have.", "NTA if they can\u2019t take your card which they usually do, it\u2019s not your problem to go out of your way to get cash, come back, then pay.", "NTA. At that point the food was probably cold. I would've left too.", "INFO: Did you take/eat the food?", "Info\n\nDid the owner answer the phone or was it one of her family members?\n\nEdit: rephrasing question", "Nta, you waited 3 time slonger than what i would have", "The owner should have talked them through the credit card transaction.", "NTA. You accommodated multiple conditions to pay,, but if you want to support the restaurant, you can always pay for this meal the next time you're there. That way, they can see there was no ill intention and you're helping to keep a favorite restaurant running.\n\nEdit: Just read that you didn't end up taking the food, but you have no plans to return. I thought this was a favorite place despite knowing it had organizational problems?", "NTA\n\nThis place sounds like a disorganized mess and grossly incompetent people working there.\n\nRunning a credit card is not rocket science, they could have looked at video on YouTube in a minute or two on how to do it.\n\nThis place will not be around very long.", "It would have been kind to have a little more patience and forgiveness, but the fact that you didn't doesn't make you TAH imo.  Unless you took the food with you and didn't pay for it. If you did not take the food, then it's their loss for not having a working card reader and/or an employee who knew how to use the card reader. If you did take the food with you, then you should have paid.", "NTA", "NTA as you didn\u2019t take the food. If they don\u2019t want that situation to happen again, they need to train more people how to process card payments. Or they need to get an atm.", "If you saw the owner pull in, the right thing to do would have been to turn around and to pay for your food. I don\u2019t know how you can even feel justified in doing this. Not to mention, you were already late when you went to pick up the food and honestly, they should have just thrown your food out once at least 30 minutes came by and you never came, but they held it to the side for you which was generous to say in the least.\n\nYTA.", "Ehhh, YTA a little bit. It's ridiculous noone else knew or could figure out how to work the card reader, but they already made the food. At that point, just go get cash. Even if it means paying a small fee for using a closer ATM. Plenty of people have been in the position you were in where, for whatever reason, a restaurant surprised them by only taking cash. If their food was already made, those people do the right thing and go out and get cash.", "You were told the food would take 25 minutes and you arrived 10 minutes later than that, then they couldn\u2019t operate the care machine so you left? Okay, sucks you were late, but a fairly understandable response, nobody wants to stand around for that long. \n\nThe problem here is simply as you were leaving you saw the owner arrive, and instead of continuing the transaction you allowed the food to be wasted. Now if you had left and the owner hadn\u2019t arrived, I\u2019d understand completely, but he was there and you still left.\n\nThis is a *small* restaurant, so I\u2019m guessing every penny counts for them. Food isn\u2019t cheap. You\u2019ve wasted their time and their resources because you didn\u2019t want to deal with \u201can awkward encounter\u201d.\n\nWell, congratulations, because the encounter you get next time you go to your wife\u2019s **favourite** restaurant is probably going to be much more awkward now.\n\nYTA.", "NTA but if you were you the next time I went I would pay for the order at that point.", "INFO: couldn't you have just left your name and number and paid later?", "Yta you've stated that this business needs customers yet you were more than happy to steal food. If I were the owners I'd have you banned for life, your not helping anyone by stealing especially when you saw the owner whilst you were on your way out.... pretty shitty behaviour in my opinion", "ESH, you were right to be angry after having been promised a short wait but if you saw her pulling in you really should\u2019ve just bit the bullet and paid. Especially if they need the business like you say they do.", "Y T A if you don\u2019t go back and pay at some stage - and call them to let them know you\u2019re going to fix them up. What you did was technically theft.\n\nEdited to reflect op\u2019s comment that they didn\u2019t take to food, in which case NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And a restaurant is a service business, so you gotta be able to provide a minimum level of service.", "NTA.\n\nu didnt take the food with u, so nta.", "NTA. They couldn't take your payment and you didn't take your food.", "YTA. Yes, the owner should teach them how to work the card reader but sometimes things are unexpected. The owner left before you arrived half an hour late to pick up food.", "Who all was late? You and spouse first. Then owner. Foul call on all of you. The others were trying to avoid a bigger mess than what was already. And yeah, owner shouldn\u2019t be the only one to know how to handle the transactions. And 35 minutes late is a long time with food already waiting. Think a waste of food and you have no idea if you would have been given a discount or not for waiting once you knew the owner was there. And you could have asked for a discount only due to not one person could handle the payment system. If they were telling the truth I still wouldn\u2019t have wanted to pay in cash unless I had a receipt. To assure it wasn\u2019t going into another\u2019s pocket.", "YTA. I would have been sympathetic and understanding of the 20 minute drive to get cash with no fee if not for the fact that you drove 20 minutes each way for your food. An ATM fee is not going to be significant in the context of a 40 minute car trip", "Hope u don\u2019t plan on going back there? Unless you pay for your meal when you go. It\u2019s a shitty situation, but u should pay. It\u2019s a small business that needs that money.", "NTA", "NTA", "I agree that arriving 10 minutes after the pickup time is not unreasonable, especially since OP states that in previous visits to that restaurant, the food hasn't been ready on time. \n\nOn the other hand, it's not reasonable for the restaurant staff to ask OP to wait 20+ minutes for an order that is sitting in a to-go container getting cold when it's the restaurant's fault that OP can't pay. The restaurant should have remade the order if OP was willing to wait for it. But the restaurant failed to offer good customer service in so many ways. \n\nI don't blame the OP for not turning around when the owner arrived as they were leaving. I'm sure they were irritated by this point. I would be. Why should they turn around to pay for cold food? NTA", "Agree. I wouldn't have waited either. Food nasty cold by then", "They added an edit saying they didn\u2019t take the food", "The owner answered the phone. We have been checked out by other family members before without issue.", "Or you could run a business that functions correctly.", "Why shouldn't they feel justified? They waited a lot longer than I would have. If they could not accept payment upon my arrival I would have went somewhere else right then.", "I should clarify. We were there at the 35 minute mark from our initial call. Not 35 minutes late.", "You\u2019re not very bright are you. What sense would it make for the business to throw out their food after 30 minutes of waiting? Should they also flush their money down the toilet? If anything, the extra time they had makes them look worse that they couldn\u2019t get their shit together.", "Or wait three more seconds. The owner was pulling in as they were leaving.", "At this point the food is way past cold.  NTA", "I should have added they we did not take or eat any of the food. We have no plans to return.", "I have to disagree. If they need the business, then they should be organized. OP waited long enough and is NTA for not waiting any longer.", "I agree with you hundred percent ESH. The restaurant needs to be more organized and teach someone else how to use the credit card reader.", "They did not take the food. They just refused to wait anymore to pay for it so went somewhere else.", "They told OP it would be 25 minutes before their meal was ready when he called the order in. He then arrived 35 minutes after he called the order in because, as he explained, they are unorganized and often take longer than they say before the food is ready. So he gave them an extra 10 minutes to get his food ready.\n\nSo he did not show up 30 minutes after his food was supposedly ready, it was 10 minutes after.", "Reread. They were not a half hour late picking up the food.", "35 minutes from the call, it wasn't waiting for 35 minutes. The most they waited was 10 minutes at most, which I think is acceptable to give them more time to get the food ready if they already have experience with unorganization.", "Well, NTA\n\nI worked in restaurants for over a decade, it's the shops responsibility to ensure that whoever is working that day is trained to run the till, including the credit card reader. It doesn't take long to show someone how to use it.\n\nAlso, I really think they mislead you about how long it was going to take her to get back. Unless there was an accident, a 7 minute ride should not take over 20 minutes. \n\nAlso the fact you didn't walk out with the food is bonus points. Most people would have walked out without waiting the supposed 7 minutes with their order.\n\nUnless they get better organized, that place isn't going to last long as incidents like this drive customers away.", "This! Idk why people are getting mad at OP when the owners of the restaurant are incompetent.", "30 minutes after they were supposed to be there. The owner was probably there when they were expected. The problem existed because they were late. Or do you think it's reasonable to expect the owner to *not* pick up their kid for inconsiderate customers?", "I love how some of you feel the need to hurl insults to get your point across.\n\nSometimes people won\u2019t agree with you. I know that might be a difficult concept to understand, but that\u2019s just how the world works.", "After waiting for a long time. NTA.", "If they were planning to pay and eat it they could have still eaten it whilst they waited. That\u2019s their fault if they didn\u2019t.", "Thats a totally different situation then nah if you didn't take the food then no harm no foul but to be fair it read as if you had taken the food and then decides to not pay.", "Why ESH? OP and wife waited over 30 minutes after they got to the restaurant to pay. How is he AH. As an owner you cannot leave people to run your business that do not known how to operate the equipment. Most people pay with Cc so this was ridiculous on the owners part. \n\nNot reasonable to make someone wait. They were well in their right to leave.", "Thx for clarifying. I would eat food that waited 10 minutes to be picked up. 35 minutes I would maybe pass it up. Sounds like had you walked back in you were due food made fresh. And an hour is reason to not pay for that batch. My daughter would eat it in a heart beat. Pack animals could be gnawing on food and her and some others would still see it\u2019s okay to eat on.", "10 mins. They arrived 35 mins after placing the order...and it is a business so it wouldn't matter if they were 35 mins late, there should always be someone there to take payment smh", "... that's not how things work. If you order takeout and get there to find out the people working behind the counter can't operate the till, you aren't required to sit down in the restaurant and wait for someone who can to show up. It's the restaurant owner who is responsible for it, not the customer. And the fact they waited over 20 minutes for the owner to get back before deciding to leave, without the food they ordered, is much more than the majority of people on here would have done.\n\nSo OP isn't the AH."]}
