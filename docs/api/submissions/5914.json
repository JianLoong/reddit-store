I\u2019m returning to work soon and my MIL seems oblivious to my struggles.\n\nI\u2019m set to return to work in about a week, and for months I have told my family and my husband\u2019s that we won\u2019t be accepting visitors from Christmas to the New Year because I want to enjoy the final days of my maternity leave without having to worry about hosting. My in-laws came for Christmas celebrations last week, but my MIL mentioned she will be passing through next week when she travels to their second home. I told her she is welcome to stop by as long as she knows that I will be attached to my son the entire time, since her visit will coincide with my first week back at work.\n\nToday, my husband spoke to his mom on the phone and she has changed her plans. She will now be traveling our way this weekend, while I am still on leave (and during the same window I mentioned before I did NOT want visitors). She asked my husband- not me- if she could stay with us for an evening, and reassured him that it will be like \u201cshe\u2019s not even here.\u201d\n\nI got upset with my husband and told him she has put us in an impossible situation: either I sacrifice the night alone with my family for HER benefit or I become the bad guy for putting my foot down. My husband was equally upset with me and said that I was being disrespectful towards his mother. His mom has a LONG history of inconsiderate behavior. \n\nJust to provide an example: my husband was working the day she and my FIL flew in for Christmas. She asked me to pick them up from the airport an hour and a half away. I told her I had never made a trip that long with my newborn alone in a car, and said I was not comfortable doing it but would be happy to pay for a rental car/etc. She responded by saying \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you comfortable? He\u2019s great in the car. You can do it!\u201dinstead of honoring my feelings and the stress that would place on me (and her newborn grandchild). Anyone with children knows 90 minutes in the car alone is no cake walk. She does not respect me, or value me, and I think this is another action in a long pattern. \n\nI don\u2019t want to put my husband in the middle, but these last few days of maternity leave are extremely important to me and I don\u2019t want to spend them with someone who openly disrespects me at every turn.

He needs to fall on his sword as it is his sword to fall on. And a sit down with husband is in order if he wants to stay married with you about your boundaries. If he isn\u2019t respecting you then he can go live with momma. You are not a pushover! \n\nGood luck Op!", "NTA. You made it clear how you wanted to spend your last week...Neither he or she respected that.

You did just see the MIL.  And your husband did know you wanted quiet between Christmas and New Years which he totally ignored.  Let her come.  Take the baby and treat yourself to a nice quiet hotel for the night.  Be upfront with hubby and let him know your decision.  Arrange for a massage.  Get your nails done.  This is your time.  Hubby can be host to his mother.   If he says that his mom would like to spend time with the baby\u2026 that\u2019s fine too.   Hand the baby over to him and thank him for understanding and that you really appreciate his generous offer of looking after kiddo for the night.", "NTA - she didn\u2019t consult you when changing her plans, and you are unavailable during her updated timeframe.

You need a partner that puts you first.", "NTA. MIL sounds bloody awful. A real manipulator, to be going behind your back. And shame on your husband for letting her do this.", "NTA but your husband and MIL are AH's. You need to put your foot down on this or it will never end.", "NTA. IMO couples will be happier if each person deals with their own family. That's why I clear any family plans with my wife before I give consent. If either of us objects to the plans, we communicate to our own parents without identifying who raised the objection. There is a tendency for in-laws to blame the spouse more harshly for any slight, so it's best not to give them the ammo. Your husband should have put up more of a fight.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry your husband doesn\u2019t take your side when his (clearly) overbearing mother makes the rules for everyone else.  If I were you, I\u2019d ask him if he feels your requests (like having alone time at the end of your leave) are unreasonable.  If he says yes, then you need to have a conversation about that;  if he says no, then ask him why he refuses to honor that request when his mother asks him to *without discussing it with you first*.  \n\nThis is a discussion you should have with him, proactively, every time you want something important so that it becomes something you *both* want, and he\u2019ll be more likely to stick to the team strategy when MIL comes round again.", "NTA\n\n\n\nTell her she can come another weekend.

Congratulations on the baby and good luck with returning to work!", "NTA\nSet your boundaries and stick to them.\n\nMy mother is like this. Sets her plans and acts the victim when they clash with mine. Or just completely disregards my boundaries altogether. Then guilt-trips me. It's exhausting. \n\nYour husband should be supporting you and your boundaries. He and the MIL are the AHs.", "NTA. Hubby needs to man up and back you up.  MIL is intrusive and he allows it.", "NTA -\n\nWhy does your husband allow and enable your MIL's behavior towards you?!  THAT is a large part of your problem.  Also your husband does not understand or validate your feelings of wanting this quiet time for your little family before you go back to work- he just doesn't get how hard it is for new Mom's to go back to work after giving birth and leave their baby home...and he needs to get a clue - QUICKLY! \n\nLet's me clear - your MIL most likely changed her plans to interfere with the time that you called off limits on PURPOSE.  Your husband should have discussed this with you prior to allowing his mother to stay, especially since he KNEW you wanted NO VISITORS during this time period. \n\nHe is choosing his mother's preference and comfort before yours.  I would actually leave and go to your parents if they live close - otherwise I would go to a hotel or somewhere else nice and quiet for you and your child. \n\nYou need to have a long talk with your husband regarding boundaries and that his mother does not respect them.  He needs to decide if he is a Mama's boy or a man who wants to be a good husband and father.  You guys need to resolve this because I am telling you that as your child gets older your MIL will only get worse and eventually you & your husband's marriage will fracture over this.", "NTA - You have a right to set boundaries for your own home and to prioritize your own needs and wants. It is not disrespectful to tell your MIL that she cannot stay with you during a time that you have already communicated to her and others that you do not want visitors. It is also not disrespectful to express your feelings about her behavior towards you and to ask for more consideration and respect from her. Your husband should also be understanding and supportive of your boundaries and feelings, rather than siding with his mother and placing blame on you.", "NTA. You primarily have a husband problem. He should back you up 100%. It\u2019s on him to stand up to his mom. She\u2019s causing stress in your marriage/family and your husband is allowing this. She\u2019s disrespecting you. \n\nNo is an entire sentence. He needs to learn to say it to his mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's not cool.\n\nYour husband seemingly agreed to these plans, and is trying to change them short notice. That's not cool. \n\nAs for you, well, whatever attachment issues you are having, leading to this declaration of no visitors, they are your issues, no-one else's. Did your husband want this at all, or did you just assume veto power and declare it, and your husband agreed because it was hard to argue with you and he was hoping to keep the peace. You seem to have decided that for the majority of the most \"family\" period of the year, you don't want anything to do with family. They should all stay the hell away, and like it. Your husband obviously actually wants family around this period, hence trying to slide this visit in the back door. Take a hard look at yourself and your wants, and understand that, it's not all about you. It's not. It's about what all three of you want/need. Attaching yourself to your child for a week straight isn't going to make it any easier to go back to work. It's going to make it harder. Much harder. You need to be getting used to palming him off to other people, not pulling him closer. It won't do the kid any favours either, they need to get used to being apart, get used to being around new/multiple people. Otherwise it will just be harder for them too. \"It takes a village\" isn't just about helping and sharing responsibility, it's about socialising and being able to be apart from the primary caregiver. \n\nBut, seen as it's Reddit and parenting, bring on the downvotes I guess?"]}
