My step sister (we\u2019ll call her L) immediately started taking all my dads attention. Making him hang out with her and buy her clothes, jewelry, etc. so I started spending more time with my Aunty. Soon, she became my closest companion. Always braiding my hair and spending time with me and sewing up colorful clothes for me that matched hers. L began stealing the clothes my Aunty made me and would break seams and buttons trying to wear them. Or she\u2019d demand I take out my braids because she didn\u2019t like them. And my dad and step mom did nothing to stop her. Anything my Aunty gave me she\u2019d steal or break. Anytime my Aunty would braid my hair or do pen tattoos on me L would demand I wash it off or take it out.\n\nWell two years ago my uncle passed away, and my Aunty was devastated. I went and stayed with her and helped her around the house as best I could. But L had a problem with this. She said that with me spending so much time with my Aunty, she was bored all the time because she \u201cdidn\u2019t have someone to share things with\u201d and I told her repeatedly to please leave me alone until I went home as my Aunt and I were grieving. Well me and my Aunty ended up staying in the same home for a few more months before I left. \n\nWhen I went home L was mad at all the stuff I got. My Aunty had braided my hair like she used to with her daughters and given me a bunch of handmade clothes along with some of our projects to put in my room. I unpacked and left for a walk. When I came back all clothes were in shreds, wood work was destroyed and scattered all around my room. I confronted L. She said that I needed to stop treating my Aunty like my mom because there\u2019s now way a white girl like me would be raised right by a black women, and that my Aunty was fat shaming L by making all MY clothes to small for her. She proceeded to text my Aunty all sorts of racist and rude comments about her culture, size, and how my Aunty was a horrible person for thinking she belonged around me. My parents made no move to stop L.\n\nWhen my Aunty showed me the texts I immediately packed my stuff and left to stay with her. If there's one thing I hate it\u2019s people disrespecting my Aunty. I told all my family members what happened and said I would not be speaking to L until my Aunty got a genuine apology from all of them, and until L paid back my Aunty for all the clothes she destroyed. Since then my family have blown up my phone saying I\u2019m being a bitch, I\u2019m jealous my sisters \u201cbetter than me\u201d. I still haven\u2019t spoken to them and it\u2019s been almost two months. I miss my dad but I can\u2019t stand my Aunty being disrespected.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being childish and stupid at this point or not, but I\u2019m starting to feel like an asshole.", "created_utc": 1669611689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6nczh/aita_for_refusing_to_speak_with_my_step_sister/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your stepsister seems like the most petty and jealous human I've ever heard of. It's absolutely wild to me that your family is supporting her, but if they are they are clearly not being told the full story or are as delusional as your stepsister. She's actively going out of her way to ruin your physical things from your aunt just because she's not getting things. She sounds extremely selfish and materialistic with no regard for you or your aunt. If you can, please stay with her and do not go back to that house because it will only get worse.
