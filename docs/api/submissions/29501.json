He would forget and then piggy back off all my work.\n\n\nMy sons birthday is this weekend and I had the kids and did a party, got the gifts and so on. Now half way through the day since there was no call from him to wish our kid happy birthday it became obvious that he forgot. He absolutely noticed by the end of the day was quite sad. I told him he will be seeing him tomorrow and maybe he has a surprise.\n\nWell nothing he didn\u2019t plan a thing and he only remembered after our son basically yelled at him for forgetting. We got in a huge phone argument about me being petty that I didn\u2019t throw him name on a card or even remind him when it was clear her forgot. I don\u2019t see why I should since he is a grown adult and he should step up.

None of the adults in our family mollycoddled me and reminded me to call him, they just let me deal with the consequences and apologize to him. I was 19 at the time, and I\u2019ve never forgotten his birthday since.\n\nI know it\u2019s just a single anecdote, but every adult in my life thought a teenager was perfectly capable of remembering a birthday and should face the consequences of being thoughtless.

His father made him sad, not you.", "Wow, he is definitely the asshole in this scenario.  It's not your job to make your ex look good to HIS OWN KID - that's HIS job.  I'm sure he has a phone, with a calendar he could utilize.  The fact he goes even further with his ridiculousness and blames you for his mistake totally explains why you're divorced.  As for mom - tell her to mind her own business, or she can pick up his slack on her own.

Your ex needs this wake up call to tell him that you are no longer responsible for him. And your mother is wrong - if you keep covering for him, you will be doing it for the rest of your life and will never be divorced from him, because he will never do it. After all, he gets someone to do all the heavy lifting of being a parent for him. \n\nLet him think you are a jerk - chances are he was going to anyway the moment you stood up for yourself for anything.", "NTA and I suggest you show your mother the top comments here. You and your ex are divorced, therefore you have no obligation to keep the peace or make him seem like a good father when he isn't. If he can forget his kid's birthday and then fail to do anything while expecting you, his EX, to do it for him, it just shows how poor of a father he is.\n\nMy great grandfather used to hide how neglectful my father was. I didn't realize how horrible he was until I was fourteen years old, a few months after my grandpapa passed, that my father had never once been involved in planning my birthday, buying the cards, the decor, or even the locker surprises that would say \"from dad.\" To this day, I hold some resentment towards my grandpapa for that and resentment towards myself - because I was giving the wrong person credit for YEARS.\nDon't be guilted into keeping up the charade.

If you did it this time, he\u2019d probably expect reminders for everything. \n\nI can guarantee you that even if you reminded him, your kids would have figured out sooner rather than later that mom is the one reminding dad about their events/important dates.", "My father has remembered my actual birthday on the day six times, and one of those was the day of my birth. \nBut he remembers my children's birthdays because i explained the basic respect - drop below this level and you will be cut off\nHe contacts the children on their birthdays, at Xmas and if they reach out he responds. \nHe can hold a conversation with all of them about their school subjects, their sport, hobbies, interests etc. \nHe couldn't with me. \nIt's not up to anyone to pretend the other parent is involved, it only hurts more when you realise it's a lie", "NTA - You're not married so you don't have to cover for him.

Is he that incompetent not to put his kids' birthdays on the phone calendar.  I mean how can he screw that up and expect people to cover for him", "NTA, but you shouldn't have set your kid up with expectations or hope by suggesting dad may have a surprise.  Your ex is able to use a phone calendar app to remind himself,  this is just laziness.\n\nPart of me may have considered sending him a reminder text when it was obvious he forgot  Not for him but for our child - to ensure THEY didn't feel like crap on their birthday.", "NTA. You\u2019re divorced - you don\u2019t need to be covering for him anymore. If he cares enough to get this upset with you, then he should care enough to remember his own child\u2019s birthday.

If you know you always forget and you're divorced (obviously since she's your ex now why would she remind you?) the easy solution is to create a yearly reminder. The kid lives with mom so he had time to run to the store for a gift in the morning. He had options and he honestly still expected you to do it all for him.

You'd be lying to your kid about their relationship with their father.", "NTA. Your mom is 100% WRONG! You shouldn\u2019t have to cover for your ex. You need to be honest with your kids about what a crappy father he is so that they can grow up knowing what he is really like. Lying to your kids to cover for a deadbeat isn\u2019t fair to the kids.  You should look into the parenting app to communicate with the ex so you have everything documented. Don\u2019t take his abuse anymore.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s a single parent now and so are you! Why would you put your name on anything when you\u2019re no longer together. He\u2019s an adult\u2026he can do his but for his kids on their birthday. Hopefully this will make him realise he needs to do better in future but we shall see.", "Do not listen to your mother. I was the kid in this situation and my mom was always calling and reminding my dad of our life events. Eventually, I was in my 20s, my mom passed away and I realized instead of now having one functional parent, I had none. It hurts more to have to grieve who you thought you had then to just grow up knowing to expect nothing from them. Instead I had to realize I had no parents to depend on now, and that was a steep learning curve for me while grieving my mom. Lying to your kids about who their parents really are doesn't help anyone but the lazy parent. My mom died 7 years ago, my father has remembered my birthday maybe twice? and once or twice he's brought me a card on my brother's birthday. When I point out it isn't mine, he just says hey at least I remembered something. It is hurtful. Covering for him is only delaying your child's disappointment and giving a man who doesn't deserve it praise. There are no benefits to doing it for anyone but your ex.", "The name on the card is the smallest issue here. Yes, putting his name on the card maybe would have looked better but the \u201cfather\u201d still forgot the birthday, didn\u2019t show at the party or call, and wants to be mad about the fucking card??? From a dad, you\u2019re NOT the asshole!", "Tbh you did the better thing for the kid. Him being upset now means he may actually get a dad who gives a shit someday. Continuing to coddle the father who cant set up a fucking calendar reminder for his kids birthday is just going to lead him to continue not giving a shit about his kid because it doesnt really affect him. Cant imagine how yall ended up divorced lol", "NTA I\u2019m torn on this, though. Because you know who suffered? Your son. I don\u2019t think you should have gone as far as signing his name on a card or lying about him being a part of the gifts you bought but a quick text the week before to give your ex a heads up may have avoided spoiling your son\u2019s birthday. In that same text tho I would\u2019ve included a comment letting him know you were doing this as a courtesy but for him not to rely on you doing it again. Bottom line, hopefully you both have the same goal of raising a healthy, well-adjusted son so if it\u2019s possible at all you need to work together and try not to keep score.", "NTA.

It sucks for the children, but he's not dependable and they will realise that at some point.", "NTA- Go ahead and rip the band aid off. You have did all the work and letting your ex piggy back off you in unfair. I wouldn\u2019t be putting mom and dad on any Christmas or birthday presents.", "Nta. You shouldnt have to cover and hide the fact that hes a crappy dad.", "NTA It sounds harsh but the kids need to know what type of father he is. He can't piggy back off your ideas now, you're exes, you're not co-habiting, which means he can't take credit for what you did and fight for more custody or whatever becuase you've made him look like a better father.\n\nYou ARE doing this for the sake of your kids, you're letting them know their other parent doesn't put any thought into them. Either he'll buck up because people aren't keeping him afloat anymore and be a proper dad, or he'll continue to blame everyone else for his shortcomings and be the shit dad he's always been.", "NTA. \n\nNo, you don\u2019t have to micromanage your EX husband\u2019s life affairs. \n\nA birthday is a *single*, *annual* date that he\u2019s required to remember as regards his child. \n\nThe barest possible minimum. \n\nYou likely have to juggle coordinating daily and weekly doctor appointments/school clubs/activities for *each* child. \n\nIf you can do all that as a mom, why on earth can a dad not remember *one* bloody date* ?! That\u2019s beyond ridiculous. \n\nYour mother can take it upon herself to become his personal secretary if she likes. I\u2019m sorry for your son, but he has a negligent AF father and he should know it.", "NTA.  Your mother is wrong. Presenting him falsely will lead to problems with your son. Remembering to do the right thing by your child is not hard.  Especially in modern times with calendars on our phones that alert to us.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing but I'm not sure if I can say it was for the right reason.\nYour ex isn't a great dad, and while you're mom is right that you could have kept covering for his mistakes for your son's sake, even though you're differently not obligated to, your son will only be happy in the mean time, but one day he'll grow up and realize that the dad he has in his head is nowhere like the one in front of him, that he was living happily on a lie, he will discover the truth the hard way when things his dad failed to do are just too much for you to cover and he will be in for a huge disappointment that he will never forget for the rest of his life.\nSo yes, while it's heart breaking to have your child realize his father doesn't love him as much as he should, it would be better to face it now and have the time to heal, and maybe try therapy for it if possible, than have the world he believes in shatter later on when he has so many memories he cherished that weren't real.", "You are not together anymore. Not your responsibility at all to parent him.\n\nHe needs to step up his game, if he wants to keep a good relationship with his son.\n\nNTA\n\nYou should refrains from putting any expectations in your kid though. Both positive or negative expectations.", "NTA. Of all the things, of all the days, that your ex needs to remember, his children\u2019s birthdays should be number one.", "NTA.  Your mom is WRONG!!  Why should you lie to your child and build his father up to be someone he's not??", "NTA. He\u2019s not your problem anymore.

Or half arsed on gifts. I grew up watching either his spouse of the moment (divorced 5 times now) or even myself have to stay on top of him to call grandkids or even siblings.\n\nIts hard to watch and see as a child, or even now. To show that lack of care about those you bring into the world. Sure, we (his children) or all adults now, but the grandkids aren't and being grown doesn't take away the hurt. It makes it worse because now you have an understanding of it all. To feel you make such little impact on our supposed loved one's lives that they can forget us...\n\nCovering for them doesn't help. No the innocent and not him. It becomes a lie and lies will ALWAYS come out. If not sooner, then later. And I never want to be on the end of \"Why did you cover for him??\" and the innocent one ends up hating us both.\n\nYou did the right thing. You're showing your son that no matter how busy life gets (and yes, it happens), he comes first. He's the priority in your life. That's love and trust me, he feels it and knows it.

It will absolutely feel as if everyone around him thinks it\u2019s fine and dandy to forget your own child\u2019s birthday, and that it\u2019s completely normal and acceptable to just have mom try to sell the idea that his name on the card is \u201cgood enough.\u201d As he gets older, he will feel like you must think he is some kind of an idiot or a fool who would buy this bologna. It\u2019s a lie, designed to help someone too incompetent to put a reminder on the calendar on the phone he no doubt keeps on his person every day like the rest of us. Not doing so is a choice, and there\u2019s no getting around that fact. \n\nThe best thing you can do is not make any excuses for your ex\u2019s behavior. If your son brings it up, acknowledge that it is actually happening and is totally unacceptable, and that your son\u2019s feelings about it are 100% justified and understandable. Be there if he wants to talk about it, and give him space if he does not. \n\nInstead, just focus on making his birthdays fun and make sure he knows that his birthday is important to you. Celebrate the day he came into your life and how grateful you are for the gift of being his mother. Create traditions that are special for both of you so he can look forward to his birthday instead of dreading it. These don\u2019t have to be expensive to be meaningful, they just need to be sincere and enjoyable for you both. Make the right kind of birthday memories, even if your ex is bound and determined to make the wrong ones.\n\nYour attitude should be: \u201cyour father forgot, but that\u2019s HIS loss, not yours.\u201d \n\nGood luck to both of you. And I hope your son has many wonderful birthdays, celebrated by the people in his life who cared enough to make that day a happy priority.\n\n(Edited for typos)", "NTA, you don't have to parent your ex and carry his mental load for him \"for the sake of your kid\".

Hence why they're calling for that info.", "You have never had a job or filed taxes, I guess.", "Have you never filed your taxes?", "I guess that is your prerogative, but it\u2019s a little odd that people are saying that their parents did exactly that, cover for other adults so they thought the adults in their lives gave a damn, and they found it more hurtful later on finding out that not only did the family never care, but also the sweet memories of having a loving family members were lies. And your still like, \u201cyea I\u2019d still prefer not to hurt the kid. I\u2019d still cover for the adult.\u201d", "Thanks, but I genuinely feel like you're missing the entire point of my comment. Doing that only sets up kids for a worse reality - the illusion of a loving family being shattered later in life is a lot worse than knowing early on what you should expect from your parent.\n\nAdd on - learning even the little, unimportant things like random trinkets from trips weren't from my father was the most hurtful thing ever.", "Let's just highlight the hypocrisy here of you saying \"adults make their own choices & they have only themselves to blame\" whilst simultaneously shaming OP for *checks notes* letting her ex suffer the consequences of his own choice to not remember his kid's birthday.  \n\nHe remembered that she added him to everything while they were married, he ASSumed she would continue to do so after their divorce instead of I dunno, ASKING if she would ahead of time. That's on him, not her. \n\nHer continuing to cover for him does not protect their child from being hurt by their fathers blatant lack of care forever. It just delays that inevitable hurt until later, with the potential added kick of the now-older child feeling guilty for giving the neglectful parent undeserved credit for all the years Mom covered. Nope. \n\nBest kiddo learns now, while he still is young, to adjust his expectations. Who knows, MAYBE OP's ex will be one of the rare ones who learns from this & does better going forward. I hope so, for his kids' sakes, so they can learn their dad is reliable. But if he doesn't learn... well best for the kids to grow up knowing who their actual support network is & who they can truly rely on.", "Oh course OP doesn\u2019t get it since you are putting the responsibility of her ex on her. That\u2019s bullshit.\n\nMuch better have the kids see their fathers actions then hide them. Much better they learn he will disappoint them and when I big event happens and he doesn\u2019t show they will at least expect it\n\nThis is so far not her job, he\u2019s shit let the kids see it through his actions not have mom hide it and push him up.", "You really need to grow up. If an adult man can't remember his son's birthday after being invited then his failure as a parent is solely on him. She did her part, she is not responsible beyond that.\n\nI mean, if you want to perpetuate the idea that mediocrity in parenting is all anyone can expect from a man then go ahead. The majority of people are capable of understanding that most men aren't that pathetic.", "So how many kids do you have and how many of their birthdays have you forgotten?\n\nA whole lot of projection coming off that OP is punishing her kid vs the ex husband who literally forgot the whole weekend.", "To be fair, it seems like you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t get it.", "It's just sad when your teen says it's her fault he didn't show up because she didn't remind him. I told her he had a calendar on his phone like the rest of the world. He can learn to use it.", "That's so awful. :(  It's hard not to internalize that kind of thing; I hope she comes to realize it's not about her and she can't hand-hold a grown adult into being a better parent."]}
