It was only after going to the ethical sanctuary where their views had changed. I think that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t like them claiming that they were the ones who taught me that that was the right decision, because initially I felt like they were trying to teach me to only care about my experience as a tourist and the money that I was paying - not the welfare of the animals\n\nBut now after reading your guys\u2019 comments I now am really grateful that I have the type of parents that can trust my judgement and actually hear me out: and the fact that they were open minded enough to change their mindset at the end of the day as well. I know a lot of people aren\u2019t able to say the same about their parents, so thank you guys for helping me realise that :)", "created_utc": 1689077662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wpp6l/aita_for_saying_i_taught_myself_something_through/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Parents were proud of me for doing something that was ethically right, and they said they were glad they were able teach me that when just hours ago they wanted to do the thickly wrong thing just because it was cheaper. So I didn\u2019t want them to take credit and I said that actually I learnt about it myself through the internet this eventually led to an argument \n\n2. People may see me as the asshole because what I said might have been quite disrespectful to my parents and I understand they may have been hurt by that but I insist that I should be able to be proud of my own little achievements without having to credit them\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And I would have expressed that gratitude to them.\n\nBut there is absolutely nothing wrong in standing your groud by saying that the whole idea was yours, thanks to your online research.\n\nThis is an odd situation. Everyone should be celebrating a fun day out. Your parents should be proud with you for choosing the ethical option, and being able to present your idea to them in a convincing fashion - and you should be proud of your parents for listening to your ideas, valuing your opinions, and paying for you to visit these places.\n\nYet everyone argued?", "> They eventually agreed and after the whole experience they told me how proud they were of me and were glad they were able to teach me right from wrong\n\n**They** correctly thought you right from wrong, which you demonstrated by your actions of seeking and recommending the ethical place over the non-ethical ones.\n\nINFO: Is that not what they meant?", "YTA if your research didn\u2019t go beyond TikTok and also, they are proud you made a \u201cbetter\u201d choice and you would think because of your upbringing this choice was made consciously or not, related to said upbringing. They are proud of a morally strong choice which I would say in most cases, is related to a healthy upbringing.", "YTA. You didn't learn right from wrong from the internet. You (maybe) learned which was the most ethical choice in this specific situation. The fact that you made that choice is what your parents taught you to do.", "YTA. \n\nYou might have found out from tiktok which parks were more ethical and which ones aren't, but tik tok didn't teach you morality. \n\nYour parents probably didn't even know about these animal abuses and you, instead of thanking them for spending more to allow you to go to a more ethical park, disregarded their contribution and thanked tik tok instead. \n\nIf I were in your parents, next time you get down of your high horse I would listen to your suggestion, but not take you along. \n\nAfter all, no parks at all are the most moral option, animals should be free ;)", "NTA, however... this is a great lesson in those little social graces that lets others feel like they're right.", "NTA. You wanted to go to the ethical sanctuary and they originally wanted to go to the cheapest. You knew the difference between what was ethical and not from the internet. Your parents don\u2019t get to claim that. Edited to add, they may have taught you right from wrong but they wanted to go to the wrong (cheap, unethical one) first and then had a ridiculous fight with you after (also wrong) which is ironic.", "Parents often don't know specific things.

Your parents thought you were talking about morality and not the animal sanctuary.", "Absolutely say thank you, but keep in mind that you are allowed to develop values and morals independently of your parents. It doesn't mean you are disrespecting them at all.", "Info. Are you sure they mean \"we taught you about ethical treatment of animals in sanctuaries\" and not \"we taught you to stand up and argue for what you think is right\"", "YTA. \n\nTikTok taught you which sanctuaries are unethical and treat animals poorly. It didn\u2019t teach you to care about that. \n\nYour parents taught you to care about those things and to be ethical and morally upright.

Were you ok with that kind of animal treatment before seeing videos on TikTok?", "YTA\nSeriously parents are not allowed to give themselves pats on the back for raising morally good children now?\nThey were not taking credit for you knowing about the sanctuaries they were expressing pride in you and the job they did raising you for you to be the type of person who CARES about the animals.\nThey were speaking about your character that they helped shape not your source of education on facts.", "NTA. Your parents need to grow up and stop being so insecure. You're not 5 years old. They didn't teach you even half the information you currently have in your brain - your schools did.", "Yep. I absolutely credit my parents with providing me with my moral compass. I also credit them for giving me the basic tools for navigating new situations that may seem morally ambiguous at first blush. \n\nThey get all the credit for laying the foundation. But they still praise me (in my 40s) for applying that to new experiences and situations. They know they didn't preprogram me with every \"right\" decision in a constantly changing world. OP's parents should be proud that they equipped their kid with the tools to make ethical and informed choices rather than bickering about their ownership of his decision-making process.", "When I initially asked them to move to an ethical sanctuary they expressed they didn\u2019t really care about whether the animals were treated ethically or not, and that we were paying and we came for the experience.

A lot of folks wouldn\u2019t have known or cared.\n\nIt\u2019s like if someone graduated with honors from college, and the parents proudly say they had a part in it because they paid the bill.  The child might resent the view, after all the parents didn\u2019t do the studying or course work.  But their paying allowed their child to not have to get a job, or worry about loans, which gave them the freedom (and choice) to apply themself.", "The internet gave you access to the information. Your parents gave you the values that taught you why ethical treatment of animals is important. They taught you how important it is to take a stand on even small decisions in life - like which animal sanctuary to visit on a holiday. They are the ones who taught you to have an inquisitive mind and to seek information beyond the obvious.\n\nThe internet is just a tool. How you use it is the important thing. Your parents gave you the freedom and the guidance on seeking the right information.\n\nHaving said that - you are still young. You'll realize the value of these intangible values and how they shape your world view much later in life.", "Ah ok I see. Probably should have made that an I.NFO judgement then. \n\nI don\u2019t think TikTok deserves all the credit (which might be why your parents feel hurt) or taught you your morals, but someone or something along the way has taught you to be concerned. And then tiktok showed you how in this instance.", "Soft YTA, \n\nYour interpretation of what your parents said doesn\u2019t make sense.
