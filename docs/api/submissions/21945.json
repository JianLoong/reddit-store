Parents were proud of me for doing something that was ethically right, and they said they were glad they were able teach me that when just hours ago they wanted to do the thickly wrong thing just because it was cheaper. So I didn\u2019t want them to take credit and I said that actually I learnt about it myself through the internet this eventually led to an argument \n\n2. People may see me as the asshole because what I said might have been quite disrespectful to my parents and I understand they may have been hurt by that but I insist that I should be able to be proud of my own little achievements without having to credit them\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And I would have expressed that gratitude to them.\n\nBut there is absolutely nothing wrong in standing your groud by saying that the whole idea was yours, thanks to your online research.\n\nThis is an odd situation. Everyone should be celebrating a fun day out. Your parents should be proud with you for choosing the ethical option, and being able to present your idea to them in a convincing fashion - and you should be proud of your parents for listening to your ideas, valuing your opinions, and paying for you to visit these places.\n\nYet everyone argued?", "> They eventually agreed and after the whole experience they told me how proud they were of me and were glad they were able to teach me right from wrong\n\n**They** correctly thought you right from wrong, which you demonstrated by your actions of seeking and recommending the ethical place over the non-ethical ones.\n\nINFO: Is that not what they meant?", "YTA if your research didn\u2019t go beyond TikTok and also, they are proud you made a \u201cbetter\u201d choice and you would think because of your upbringing this choice was made consciously or not, related to said upbringing. They are proud of a morally strong choice which I would say in most cases, is related to a healthy upbringing.", "YTA. You didn't learn right from wrong from the internet. You (maybe) learned which was the most ethical choice in this specific situation. The fact that you made that choice is what your parents taught you to do.", "YTA. \n\nYou might have found out from tiktok which parks were more ethical and which ones aren't, but tik tok didn't teach you morality. \n\nYour parents probably didn't even know about these animal abuses and you, instead of thanking them for spending more to allow you to go to a more ethical park, disregarded their contribution and thanked tik tok instead. \n\nIf I were in your parents, next time you get down of your high horse I would listen to your suggestion, but not take you along. \n\nAfter all, no parks at all are the most moral option, animals should be free ;)", "NTA, however... this is a great lesson in those little social graces that lets others feel like they're right.", "NTA. You wanted to go to the ethical sanctuary and they originally wanted to go to the cheapest. You knew the difference between what was ethical and not from the internet. Your parents don\u2019t get to claim that. Edited to add, they may have taught you right from wrong but they wanted to go to the wrong (cheap, unethical one) first and then had a ridiculous fight with you after (also wrong) which is ironic.", "Parents often don't know specific things.
