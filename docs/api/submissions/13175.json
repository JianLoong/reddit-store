We had our first child at the height of Covid, so my husband's parents, sister, and her family did not meet him in person until his first birthday.\n\nI just delivered our second two weeks ago, and my husband's family (4 adults and 3 kids) asked if they could all visit during spring break to see the baby (which is the end of next week). I said OK.\n\nAlthough the 7 of them would be staying at an Airbnb, I know they will be spending all day every day at our home to see the kids. I told my husband to make sure they know we will be ordering in every meal, and beyond eggs and cereal and some drinks and snacks (i.e. chips and fruit), I wasn\u2019t planning to get much else. I\u2019m also tired and up with the baby all night, I\u2019m still trying to get breastfeeding established, and I\u2019m exhausted at the very thought of 7 people being in my house every day for a week while I\u2019m trying to nurse and rest and manage a toddler\u2019s big emotions around a new sibling.\n\nHis response was \u2018Well we are going to need X and X for my parents and X for the kids, and I was thinking one day I can make X.\u2019 And he started describing needing to get the \u2018best\u2019 bread and the \u2018best\u2019 cheese\u2026 all of which involves trips to numerous places. He even said he was going to ask my dad (who occasionally buys us some specialty grocery stuff that I ask for and drops it off) to pick up a bunch of items for them. \n\nAt this point, I got really mad. I said \u2018I am not trying to go above and beyond here and play host when I\u2019m 3 weeks postpartum. They can eat the stuff from the grocery store even if it\u2019s not the best and deal for 5 days.\u2019 He told me I sound spiteful. \n\nI was also frustrated because when his family visits, my husband checks out and just plays with his nephews and chats for hours with his BIL, and I know I\u2019m going to be the one setting out snacks, tidying up, etc. He seems more concerned with his family having fun, the visit being a good time, and with them being comfortable, than with me getting what I need. I feel like it doesn\u2019t matter what I ask for - he isn\u2019t going to have my back, so I have to protect myself and my own well-being. \n\nWe got in a big fight about it. I yelled at him and am not really talking to him now. They show up next week, and I'm feeling a lot of anger and resentment about it.\n\nSo\u2026 am I the asshole for not \u2018lifting a finger\u2019 for my visitors?", "created_utc": 1679769121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uqma/aita_for_not_doing_anything_hostessy_for_my/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And they're expecting to stay all day EVERY day? And your husband wants you to be Suzy Hostess 3 weeks postpartum while he sits on his butt and does nothing to help?\n\nDo yourself a favor. Go book a nice hotel room for you and the baby and stay there until everyone is gone. NTA", "NTA. If you've got family that lives nearby, I would pack the kid up and go and stay with them. While you're husband's family is in town, let him deal with them", "My mom told me to stay in pajamas after the births so no one can expect much from you.  Best advice I ever followed.  The second you put on jeans and do your makeup, it's all over from there", "NTA sorry if it\u2019s been said before but if not, then you should maybe take the baby & stay with your parents while his family visits. That way he has to take care of the toddler & everything else.", "NTA. If anything, the family should be coming in to take care of *your* needs. If they can't understand that, they need to stay home.", "Nta. If they had manners theyd be bringing food and groceries", "NTA but your husband is and a major one at that, no wonder you\u2019re not speaking to him. Why is he prioritizing how his family will feel vs his postpartum wife and new baby? Set boundaries that they can visit your home for a few hours maybe for a few days max and if your husband wishes to entertain them more then he can meet them elsewhere. NTA.", "NTA and I disagree with all the comments saying that husband should be doing the hosting and buying the specialty foods - this is taking help away from OP...it should be all hands on deck for parenting. NOONE should be hosting. IL's should bring takeout and wash dishes and expect nothing but to help.", "NTA! Holy MOG what is wrong with him?", "NTA. The phrase I\u2019ve heard and is so true is that with a newborn you need staff, not guests. The husband is def an A-H for this. This mom is 3 weeks post partum and the last thing they need (husband included), is family/kids in their house all day who expect anything. If you\u2019re the visitor in this situation and not helping, you\u2019re not helping by being there.", "Seriously. Just a general FYI for all people who visit new parents in the first 3 months \u2014 don\u2019t come over unless you\u2019re prepared to wash dishes, change a diaper, feed some people.", "OMG right? If there is anything to criticize OP for, I'd say she should make the boundary even more firm! I think they should either only be seeing the family-in-law outside of the house at activities family-in-law organizes (walk to a park and kids play on playground, sit by a pond and kids feed ducks frozen peas, meet in the library for a read aloud event and have a snack outside after, family-in-law organizes a picnic, family goes out for an inexpensive dinner the kids will like, etc). Or else family-in-law can not come at all.\n\nOnly one person in this entire story recently grew a whole new human--OP. And that's just pregnancy! Childbirth is CRAZY.... I don't know or care how exactly OP did it, but I know that any form of childbirth is at best incredibly physically demanding, or at worst it can be painful/scary/traumatic. OP deserves rest, support, and bonding time with her now-one-person-larger family. Anyone who is detracting from OP's ability to access those things does not deserve to be near her or her home.", "Yep. This is why my ILs were not allowed to come until 6 weeks.", "and unless the husband pushed a watermelon out of his body, he gets no say in how OP spends her postpartum recovery ***that she needs***.\n\nNTA OP. do not play hostess. if he wants to play host, then he can take on ALL of the host responsibilities. you are convalescing after a medical procedure.", "I think It sounds like she doesn\u2019t want him to entertain them, she wants him to help around the house/with kids.", "My parents came to stay with us when my child was 3 days old. They had seen him at the hospital when he was born.\nI was a first time mom, had an unexpected 10+ lb baby, naturally, and had been in labor for 4 days.  \n\nMy parents came to stay with us. They came in saw the baby, etc, and then my father told me I was rude because they'd been there a half an hour and I hadn't even offered him a beverage.  I hadn't slept in about a week at that point. I pointed to the kitchen, 10 feet away and told him he can help serve himself.", "You ignored her, right?", "This is the best advice. If they ask you what\u2019s for dinner, smile pleasantly and say you don\u2019t know, so they should ask your husband because he\u2019s doing all the cooking while you recover from the birth. If they ask for a drink or snack, tell them to help themselves from the fridge or ask your husband. Do this in a polite voice every time any request no matter how minor is made and after a while they\u2019ll get the idea. Also don\u2019t do any tidying or housework, no matter how messy things get. If they offer to \u201chelp\u201d you with the dishes, say you\u2019re sure your husband would appreciate that since he\u2019s handling the housework. Go a little further and ask them to bring you stuff! \n\nI know this tactic works because I\u2019ve done it myself! Basically a polite version of weaponized incompetence while you heal from the pregnancy and birth and get breastfeeding established.", "This! How\u2019s your relationship with your MIL? I would text her. \u201cHi! We are looking forward to your visit! But I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate right now just with the new baby and the toddler, after just a few weeks, we really don\u2019t have our ducks in a row, I know you remember what it was like! I\u2019m not yet able to do ANY of the typical hosting chores, so y\u2019all are going to be on your own while I tend to the baby and rest up! Thanks for understanding, I just didn\u2019t want you to be disappointed or offended. Husband is in charge of all the plans when you visit, and I\u2019m not sure he knows what he\u2019s getting into, haha! He could probably use some guidance from you on how to run the household while entertaining the family.\u201d", "This is a great idea", "Ding ding. This is it!", "This is the solution!!!!! NTA your husband and in laws are inconsiderate", "Two thumbs up for this advice!!"]}
