We had our first child at the height of Covid, so my husband's parents, sister, and her family did not meet him in person until his first birthday.\n\nI just delivered our second two weeks ago, and my husband's family (4 adults and 3 kids) asked if they could all visit during spring break to see the baby (which is the end of next week). I said OK.\n\nAlthough the 7 of them would be staying at an Airbnb, I know they will be spending all day every day at our home to see the kids. I told my husband to make sure they know we will be ordering in every meal, and beyond eggs and cereal and some drinks and snacks (i.e. chips and fruit), I wasn\u2019t planning to get much else. I\u2019m also tired and up with the baby all night, I\u2019m still trying to get breastfeeding established, and I\u2019m exhausted at the very thought of 7 people being in my house every day for a week while I\u2019m trying to nurse and rest and manage a toddler\u2019s big emotions around a new sibling.\n\nHis response was \u2018Well we are going to need X and X for my parents and X for the kids, and I was thinking one day I can make X.\u2019 And he started describing needing to get the \u2018best\u2019 bread and the \u2018best\u2019 cheese\u2026 all of which involves trips to numerous places. He even said he was going to ask my dad (who occasionally buys us some specialty grocery stuff that I ask for and drops it off) to pick up a bunch of items for them. \n\nAt this point, I got really mad. I said \u2018I am not trying to go above and beyond here and play host when I\u2019m 3 weeks postpartum. They can eat the stuff from the grocery store even if it\u2019s not the best and deal for 5 days.\u2019 He told me I sound spiteful. \n\nI was also frustrated because when his family visits, my husband checks out and just plays with his nephews and chats for hours with his BIL, and I know I\u2019m going to be the one setting out snacks, tidying up, etc. He seems more concerned with his family having fun, the visit being a good time, and with them being comfortable, than with me getting what I need. I feel like it doesn\u2019t matter what I ask for - he isn\u2019t going to have my back, so I have to protect myself and my own well-being. \n\nWe got in a big fight about it. I yelled at him and am not really talking to him now. They show up next week, and I'm feeling a lot of anger and resentment about it.\n\nSo\u2026 am I the asshole for not \u2018lifting a finger\u2019 for my visitors?", "created_utc": 1679769121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uqma/aita_for_not_doing_anything_hostessy_for_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
