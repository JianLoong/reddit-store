We had our first child at the height of Covid, so my husband's parents, sister, and her family did not meet him in person until his first birthday.\n\nI just delivered our second two weeks ago, and my husband's family (4 adults and 3 kids) asked if they could all visit during spring break to see the baby (which is the end of next week). I said OK.\n\nAlthough the 7 of them would be staying at an Airbnb, I know they will be spending all day every day at our home to see the kids. I told my husband to make sure they know we will be ordering in every meal, and beyond eggs and cereal and some drinks and snacks (i.e. chips and fruit), I wasn\u2019t planning to get much else. I\u2019m also tired and up with the baby all night, I\u2019m still trying to get breastfeeding established, and I\u2019m exhausted at the very thought of 7 people being in my house every day for a week while I\u2019m trying to nurse and rest and manage a toddler\u2019s big emotions around a new sibling.\n\nHis response was \u2018Well we are going to need X and X for my parents and X for the kids, and I was thinking one day I can make X.\u2019 And he started describing needing to get the \u2018best\u2019 bread and the \u2018best\u2019 cheese\u2026 all of which involves trips to numerous places. He even said he was going to ask my dad (who occasionally buys us some specialty grocery stuff that I ask for and drops it off) to pick up a bunch of items for them. \n\nAt this point, I got really mad. I said \u2018I am not trying to go above and beyond here and play host when I\u2019m 3 weeks postpartum. They can eat the stuff from the grocery store even if it\u2019s not the best and deal for 5 days.\u2019 He told me I sound spiteful. \n\nI was also frustrated because when his family visits, my husband checks out and just plays with his nephews and chats for hours with his BIL, and I know I\u2019m going to be the one setting out snacks, tidying up, etc. He seems more concerned with his family having fun, the visit being a good time, and with them being comfortable, than with me getting what I need. I feel like it doesn\u2019t matter what I ask for - he isn\u2019t going to have my back, so I have to protect myself and my own well-being. \n\nWe got in a big fight about it. I yelled at him and am not really talking to him now. They show up next week, and I'm feeling a lot of anger and resentment about it.\n\nSo\u2026 am I the asshole for not \u2018lifting a finger\u2019 for my visitors?", "created_utc": 1679769121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uqma/aita_for_not_doing_anything_hostessy_for_my/", "score": 2171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants to go get specialty stuff or fancy cheeses or whatever, let him. Just make it clear that *he* needs to be the one serving food, cleaning up, etc. Be specific about what you need him to do. My husband tries to \"tidy up\", but our versions of tidy are very, very different. It goes much better when I communicate what I need from him with specificity. For example, \"Can you clear off the kitchen counters, and put the appliances back into the cabinets?\" is much more effective than \"Can you clean up the kitchen?\" I also have to be conscious to give him grace when our versions of what needs to happen don't line up exactly (this is a 2 way street, he also has to understand that I do things differently too). That isn't a bad thing- we are different people! \n\nIf he is hanging with BIL, and you notice something that actually needs doing right now (remember, not all tasks actually need to be done right this second, even if it is annoying), use your words and ask for help. It may feel rude to interrupt, but you can do this politely (\"Hey honey, can you please wrangle Little Joey? He's getting in the baby's space.\" Vs \"Hey fool, take out the trash. It smells like dirty diapers in here. Also, don't forget to go be a dad on occasion just because your brother is here.\"). \n\nRemember, some stuff feels enormous right now because your hormones are going absolutely bonkers right now. Both you and he need to focus on communication, and be aware that your hormones are going to make your emotions and thoughts super weird  at times. It's one of those uncomfortable realities of early postpartum momhood. I have had a few moments of \"omg, how dare he?\" about my husband, when, looking back even a few hours later, I realize he was trying to do the right thing and didn't know what I needed, or that I was making a mountain out of a molehill (and other times that he really did mess up, because he's human too \ud83d\ude02). When you are recovering from childbirth, exhausted from lack of sleep, always always always on duty as mom to a toddler and newborn, and riddled with the most insane hormonal shift known to man, it is easy to get stuck in your feelings and see your husband as the enemy, and start picking apart every single thing he does or doesn't do. \n\nYou didn't ask about this, but make sure you guys communicate about other expectations for this visit too. If his family is truly going to be hanging out at your house all day, is he going to have your back that you need to be the one holding baby most of the time? Even if you are sitting down nursing the baby 90% of the visit, having that many guests all day for 5 days sounds exhausting and setting everyone up for failure. Tell your husband you need him to come up with some plans to get them out of the house on a regular basis. Whether it is the zoo, the playground, whatever, you will need breaks. Hopefully the AirBNB has a pool or something. TBH, I can't imagine hosting that many people all at once for that long right now (or ever, but that's me). We keep visits to only a few people, and only for a few hours at most. Best of luck to you guys!", "NTA. I would heavily advise just meeting your and the kids needs.

You do not visit a 3 weeks postpartum mom of a new baby and toddler and expect to be wined and dined with \"the best\" and/or be entertained, nor do you expect your wife who is 3 weeks postpartum with a new baby and toddler to do any of these things for visitors.

He should only take one as much as he wants to/can AFTER he\u2019s taken care of his own family", "I'd definitely be the person asking constantly, because I wouldn't want to do something wrong and make even more work for you. A detailed list would be perfect.", "I'm calling his mom in this situation to get her thoughts. Lol. If she is a reasonable person she will call her son and go \"Wtf are you thinking?\" and if she's not, then I'd know to start the divorce process.", "And his only job should be helping OP with her needs and the baby. Not shopping and cooking for someone else all day.", "Actually it sounded like he was going to and OP didn't want any extras, even if Husband was the one providing it", "To be fair we don\u2019t know that that isn\u2019t the family\u2019s plan. I hope it is.", "It\u2019s weird that it sounded that way to you since he was trying to get OP to ask her father to pick up fancy groceries for his family instead of troubling himself to go buy his own supplies. And yeah, he said something he would make one day, so what is he doing the rest of the week?", "One of my friends would come over and rock and walk my colicky baby so I could shower and do laundry. It was absolutely incredible.", "What I wanted most was interaction with another adult. My husband is great at being an active partner who does his part so the chores and stuff never felt overwhelming in themselves to me. (Until covid hit and I was homeschooling a special needs child and taking care of a baby who was around ~1 when lockdowns started) but talking to another adult that wasnt my husband was so helpful to me", "NTA. \nhonestly they would be starving until my husband got off his ass to set out snacks and get them food.

Just go back every night to put milk in the fridge and say hi and bye to them.\n\nHis family his problem if he wanted to be that difficult.\n\nNTA but the things is you will still end up doing alot of things for his family and if they don't have the decency to help you, you should let them have the family reunion they so deserve because resentment is a bi\\*ch and you really don't need that while you are healing.", "Can you stay with your parents for a week.

An hour or two before they arrive, take the baby (toddler can stay with dad) and go to your parent's house. Ask it they mind if you stayed there until  your in-laws go home. Ask them to let no one visit you until they go home.", "YTA  Picking a fight with your husband over his family's coming cross country to meet their new grandchild/relative is a real self-concerned-only moment.  His family don't expect OP to entertain or feed them other than letting them visit the house to meet the new baby see their older grandchild.  Hubby's family will want to do what they can to help OP and her family.  It's no big deal to feed them if you choose to -- order food to be delivered in.  All you need to do is make sure that there are enough clean glasses that they can wash the food down with water.  A sure way to piss hubby off further and to make for bad relationships with his family is to make their visit an issue for fights.  Be gracious to them when they visit, repair to your bedroom when you're not up to being there to engage with them/when you're breast feeding, etc.  If you're not breast feeding, the out of town relatives will want to hold and feed the new baby as well as play with their older grandchild.   \n How can that not help?    Had 6 kids, was always back to work within a week \\[even after a c-section delivery of twins\\] so it's hard to imagine why having relatives visit is a problem.  Perhaps OP had some serious complications of delivery or during her pregnancy that are disabling her 3 weeks later?", "NTA. Do not set out a single fucking snack and do not tidy a damn thing.

You just gave birth for goodness sake!\nWhat the heck is your husband even thinking? You just had his baby, you and your kids should be his primary concern, not him focusing on his family visiting, his family who can take care of themselves.\n\nNTA and I hope your husband will see sense before the relatives arrive. Hopefully he might even say 'ah, actually next week isn't good for us, maybe check back in a month'", "totally NTA if you\u2019re visiting someone who just *gave birth* especially a family member, you should be going to help and take care of them. your husband is a dick and sounds misogynistic tbh, you just birthed your joint child, he should be waiting on you hand and foot imo. idk i have strong opinions about care of pregnant people by their partners lol", "NTA!\n\nOP, pack you and the children up and go to your parents.\n\nIf his family is coming by, they can visit the baby they created - the AH who claims to be a loving husband and father.", "Husband needs to read the Lemon Clot Essay.

I am also two weeks postpartum. March 9. I finally just flat out told people to stop visiting me today.  I need to focus on increasing my milk supply, and I can\u2019t do it with constant interruptions. I cannot imagine in-laws visiting for a week right now! The last thing I would do is \u201chost\u201d duties. So NTA.", "I don\u2019t even need to read the whole post. Just from the title you are NTA. Your in laws suck.

Show up to visit for a couple of hours a day and then leave back out.  \n\nMake him be responsible.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to nest with your little baby and all your energy right not needs to be focused on baby and toddler.

They are the ones who should be helping you, they should be bringing food and not creating a burden on you, they should be helping take the weight off you and helping you to relax and not making shit hard for you. People who want a 3 week pp mother to up and serve them do not have any business being around a new mother, period. I hope you show your partner this thread cos it seems like it either starts at him or he's being told by family, so you either have a husband problem or a husband's family problem and neither are good. You should be relaxing, taking care of your new baby, and some with your toddler with help of your husband, and if anything, if he wants all this stuff for his family he can do it, you shouldn't be doing shit", "Wtf why aren't they coming to help you? This is bullshit, I would cancel altogether.  Your husband is an AH and if his family feels the way he does then they're AHs too!! NTA AT ALL", "NTA.

They\u2019ll figure it out.", "NTA op this makes me sad to read. Do you normally cater to his and his family's every need and whim? What does he do for you in this relationship? He isn't treating you like a partner he loves and respects, he is treating you like a maid. Though a maid at least gets paid a wage.", "NTA there should NEVER be guests this soon after a birth. Also, your husband can deal with them. You\u2019re still recovering from a MAJOR medical event. How ridiculous of your in-laws!!", "Why is he angry at you?

My Dad has come to visit and when we just sat around and chatted and ordered food, his remark was along the lines of \"...so this is it?\"\n\nI was a few months postpartum at that time. I couldn't even IMAGINE trying to entertain a massive family at three weeks postpartum.\n\nIf your husband wants to entertain, fine, but he should also allow you to focus on bonding with your baby and resting.

I also don\u2019t think his family expects you to play hostess and just want to visit you all.", "NTA. The rule should be that anyone that visits after you\u2019ve given birth better be ready to do chores. You should not have to entertain anyone at 3 weeks postpartum. Your husband is being ridiculous. If there\u2019s anything he wants to have in the house for his family then he should get off his ass & take care of it. His mom should know better. I visited my sil after she had my nephew. After I held the baby I asked her what chores she needed help with. My husband & I cleaned the kitchen, did some food prep & did the laundry while we visited. We held the baby so she could shower & take a nap. That\u2019s what they should be doing for you. It\u2019s supposed to be about you & the baby right now not entertaining guests.

Any visitors in the first couple months after having a new baby should be taking care of mom, not the other way around. 2 weeks after I had my first child, my mother-in-law came to \u201chelp\u201d.
