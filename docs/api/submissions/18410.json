Being one, he can't swim, so I sat in the baby pool and let him do his thing.\n\nThe way this pool is set up, I sat in the deepest part of the baby pool. The water was maybe 2 feet deep, and my son was standing on my lap. Behind me was a walkway, then the big kid pool. (4 feet deep) \n\nI heard the lifeguard shouting, and she kicked a group of kids out of the big kid pool for roughhousing. There were 13 of them, I'm guessing ages 10-14. They immediately jumped into the baby pool, where there were about 20 kids under 5 there. \n\nThey immediately started playing tackle football not far from us. I gave them some space, but my son got hit in the head with the ball. I told them to be careful, there were little ones in the pool, then I moved to the opposite side to give them space. \n\nFive minutes later, we were back in the middle of their game, and I got elbowed. We moved again, sitting literally underneath the lifeguard. They kept playing rough, and I saw them push a little girl, maybe 3 years old under the water. The parents told the lifeguard, who didn't react to it at all. They ended up leaving. I saw four more babies get hit by the ball and the kids chasing it, and this group was taking up the entire baby pool.  It wasn't safe for the littles, so all of the parents ended up taking their kiddos out. \n\nNow, here's where I might be TA. My son was throwing a fit because he wanted to stay in the pool, and I'm worn out between teething and the growth spurt he's been in. I yelled at the kids that they needed to get out of the baby pool. I ended up taking my son to the lazy river to splash instead, but they called me a bitch and a Karen, and told me to mind my own business. \n\nI know Reddit isn't super friendly towards parents, but my husband thinks I should have gone to the lifeguard.

OP is in the right to go off on the kids for ruining something for little kids.", "NTA - the clue is in the name - BABY pool.   \nIf my 1 year old kid  had got hit by a ball from kids being rough in the baby pool who were there because they were too rough for the main pool there would have been a lot of shouting going on - and a formal complaint to management about an incompetent lifeguard", "NTA and that lifeguard needs to be reported. The first priority of a lifeguard is safety and the SECOND your son got hit in the head with a football (even if it wasn\u2019t a hard hit) the kids should have been kicked out of the pool and your son evaluated", "You're nicer than I am. Your baby got hit with a ball. Teens don't belong in the baby pool. They were kicked out of the big pool for a reason.", "NTA and you probably handled it way better than I would\u2019ve and I\u2019m not even a parent. In your defense, you yelled at them because the lifeguard was watching but clearly wasn\u2019t doing shit.", "NTA You\u2019re right, there are many entitled parents out there. In this case however, you were well within your reason to ask these older kids to leave the baby pool. I\u2019m actually shocked that no one said anything sooner. There are designated pools for a reason- safety. I\u2019d probably take it up a notch and call the aquatics director of the facility- the lifeguard handled this situation very poorly.", "NTA", "The lifeguard didn\u2019t do their job. You should have reported this to management immediately. Those kids need to be banned, they are a danger to the littles.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nWhat a shit lifeguard. What if that 3 year old drowned or was injured?", "Especially where they pushed a little girl under the water. At the pool I go to that would have resulted in a ban for the rest of the season at least. OP really should complain to pool management; these kids were an active danger to everyone in the pool, themselves included, and that lifeguard should have booted the lot of them.", "I would have zero patience if my child got hit with the ball and would have screamed at them immediately.", "Worked at a pool for a long time. Parents will drop off their 12-15 year olds and just straight up leave. We had to ban several families one year bc their kids sucked so hard", "No clue where the older kids parents where. I got the impression they were all dropped off for some kind of party", "I'm thinking about calling tomorrow to talk to the manager but I feel like I should have done it then. I just had too much going on with the baby screaming and getting everyone dressed and ready to go", "What I don't get is the pool was part of a park. They could have walked over to the field, played football and came back with no issues", "Not just the babies but the safety of the rough housing kids as well. A 4\u2019 deep pool provides a lot more cushion for falls than a 2\u2019 deep pool does and one wrong fall could easily crack a head open.", "Yeah. No way I would have let it go any further", "You absolutely should call them tomorrow. Talk to the aquatics director if you can. I worked at a pool for 10 years and this would never fly, they need to retrain staff asap", "This is serious.  Older kids should NOT be able to make the kiddie pool unusable for toddlers.\n\nIf the lifeguard knew, and didn't act, (which is what you relayed) then next step is to go the the management and complain.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Please report the lifeguard. What happened was unsafe for multiple kids *and toddlers.* It was completely wrong for the lifeguard to let the roughhousing continue. It clearly was a visible issue, and a family reported it, so she just chose to ignore it for no real reason.", "NTA- honestly you didn't do enough. This should be reported to pool management. They were creating a legitimately unsafe environment", "NTA and this is a perfect example of when to speak to a manager. If someone had gotten hurt, the lifeguard and manager would have lost their jobs and been sued, so raising your hand and making them fix the issue would  have been a favor to them as well as to the babies who could have been harmed.", "NTA. The baby pool is for babies, and anyone making it unsafe for babies needs to GTFO.", "NTA.  I would have gone off when my baby got hit with the ball.", "NTA but that lifeguard should be fired for letting that happen.  She kicks them out of the big pool for rough housing but let\u2019s them do it when there are babies and small children around?  What in the actual fuck were they thinking?  This is so abhorrent, it\u2019s mind blowing.", "NTA but you should report that lifeguard. Their job is keeping everyone safe in the pool. Lives depend on it.", "NTA The lifeguard wasn't doing their job", "NTA. I\u2019d have gone viral.", "NTA. You gave them plenty of space and time. The bop on the head would have had me yelling.", "I'm not a parent, but if this happened to any kid I happened to be caring for, heads would be rolling (figuratively, of course). NTA", "NTA, those kids are well old enough to know better, plus they had been told already to stop roughhousing. Don\u2019t second guess protecting your child from physical harm because some kids got mouthy with you! They should be listening to the adults around them and there should be more consequences to harming little kids than they experienced.\n\nYou should write the pool management. The lifeguard should have kicked them out of the baby pool, no question.", "The lifeguard should have kicked them out of the facility. If their actions aren\u2019t safe in one pool, they\u2019re not safe in any pool. \n \nNTA", "Interesting that the lifeguard kicked the roughhousing kids out of the older kids pool but did nothing when they moved to the toddler pool.  OP needs to report that lifeguard.  And NTA", "It was a different life guard in each pool. But the way it was set up she had her back to the big kid pool. There's not a chance she didn't hear the other one kicking them out", "Please do.  This is awful and that lifeguard is a horrible employee and a liability for the pool.", "It's totally fair for you not to have done it then. Your priority was your baby.", "I\u2019m wondering if maybe each pool had its own lifeguard? So the one at the baby pool wasn\u2019t the one at the big kid pool?", "Is this a swim club that requires membership?  Either way you need to speak up, but if there are membership dues, you need to squawk loudly.", "just a case of stubbornness and not wanting to give in to the rules. they just didn\u2019t care", "Yeah that's the set up. But the two lifeguards were less than ten feet apart so I know the baby pool guard heard", "Community pool so no membership or anything like that", "NTA  Those kids should have been removed from the facility.  The lifeguard should have seen to it themself or called for security to usher them out.  Either way, you were fine.", "NTA. The lifeguard was not doing her job. If she kicked the kids out of the big pool for misbehaving, why would she allow them to terrorize the little ones. One of them could have been serious injured. \n\nThe lifeguard should have been reported. Someone could get hurt on her watch.", "NTA and the lifeguard is. I would have also told those \u201cbig kids\u201d off in that situation. Ridiculous playing footy in a baby pool. If they were just sitting and chatting, I\u2019d have zero problem with that. It\u2019s simply about respect and safety.", "NTA. if the pool you were in was designated for toddlers, then yeah, they had not business being in that area.", "It\u2019s never too late and it may prevent a tragedy in the future. Worked as a pediatric nurse for years and I cringed when I read about the 3 yr old being pushed under. Not to mention possible head injuries the young kids could have gotten from being hit by an object, elbowed, etc.. The lifeguard failed miserably and to let those kids endanger the younger ones and use profanities/name-call is not acceptable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\np", "Theoretically, 12 to 15 year olds should be plenty old enough to mostly behave themselves and go out unsupervised. Reality is often disappointing.", "Ugh.  Yeah, it's still unacceptable that the lifeguard failed to make the environment safe.  The management would want to know, I would think, even if it's to protect themselves from lawsuits from people getting injured on their employee's watch.", "NTA. I'm not sure anyone could call you one. I hope you made a complaint about the life guard and the kids. I'm surprised no one else yelled at them.", "Should have reported it to lifeguard and if they refused to do anything management.\n\nNTA for yelling but next time you should report it and hopefully it will be dealt with. If not complain even more, use social media etc. Pool needs to learn to protect the babies.", "NTA at all", "The lifeguard should have told them no big kids in the baby pool, but the lifeguard didn\u2019t. I would have told them to get out.", "NTA OP.", "NTA. Why didn't the lifeguard eject them from the pool entirely? Generally kiddie pools have age requirements so that older kids don't do exactly what they did. At least the pools I went to as a kid did. \n\nIn this case it's ok to go full momma bear on those punks because they're causing an unsafe environment for the tiny humans. The first time a child got hit with the ball, they should have been bounced.", "NTA at all. But what baffles me is that the lifeguard did nothing, whereas a few moments earlier he/she did act when they were roughhousing in another pool. He/she did react to the minor problem (that pool was for bigger children) but not for the major problem. I can't understand why, especially since parents had complained.", "NTA, but why would the lifeguard kick them out of the big kid pool for roughhousing but allow them to hurt little ones in the baby pool?", "100% NTA\n\nyou even put up with your child and you being hit. The moment the ball hit my baby of have been pissed. Kids are usually so absorbed in what they are doing that they don't consider other people. That's natural. They need to be taught better. Then they had the nerve to call you Mars and tell you to mind your own business? If i had said something like that to an adult when I was a kid my mom would have drowned me lol", "Gah i wish i could upvote this more than once", "Lmao literally why", "Please call! This isn't even just about your experience. If those or any other kids repeat this behavior someone's child could be seriously hurt or worse. Those life guards need to do their damn job", "NTA\n\nReport the lifeguard - she wasn't doing her job.", "NTA AT ALL- The fact that they almost drowned a 3 y/o is fucking horrifying.  Idk what kind of ball they were tossing around (nerf, plastic, etc.), but it's still really shitty to hit multiple toddlers in the head with one.  The last place they should've been allowed to go in was the baby pool if they'd already been kicked out of the general pool.\n\nLifeguard is also a major AH for failing to do their fucking job.  Idk how they could watch a bunch of boys create enough mayhem to make multiple parents complain and leave, and then just ignore it all.  Had they seriously harmed a little kid, the lifeguard would be in some seriously deep shit for negligence.\n\nEdit: hit the post button too early by mistake", "The life guard did nothing whilst several babies were hit in the head with balls and several adults had been bumped around whilst supervising under 5's in a pool.\n\nThis sounds unlikely, the life guard either needs firing or a second one is needed. I'd say YTA for not getting management involved right away since these older children were getting so rowdy that they directly caused babies to be hit in the head and one pushed under water! Utter madness.", "I don't understand how these kids were clearly too rough for the general \"all ages\" pool, but them hitting multiple toddlers with a ball and almost drowning a little girl in the baby pool didn't seem to set off any alarms with the lifeguard.  Why not just kick them out of the park when they initially became a problem?  And WHY allow them to go directly into the BABY POOL?", "I dont know how you kept your cool when your kid got hit. NTA but complain to the manager, that was so unsafe.", "NTA - but the lifeguard was!", "I mean they were already moved on from a pool for rough housing", "wich makes even less sense is that they literally just got kicked out of the big kids pool for roughhousing??? i mean even if it wasnt the same lifeguard, if OP saw them being kicked, so did the lifeguard that was just above the baby pool. this place has huge problems and OP definitely should send a complain to the management.", "I\u2019d take a key and pop the fuckers\u2019 ball", "that was my wonder; but if *you*  heard/saw it happen, lifeguard definitely did too. he needs to be reported. but a move to try wouldve been to go to the other guard that just kicked them out."]}
