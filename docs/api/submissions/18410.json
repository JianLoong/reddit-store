Being one, he can't swim, so I sat in the baby pool and let him do his thing.\n\nThe way this pool is set up, I sat in the deepest part of the baby pool. The water was maybe 2 feet deep, and my son was standing on my lap. Behind me was a walkway, then the big kid pool. (4 feet deep) \n\nI heard the lifeguard shouting, and she kicked a group of kids out of the big kid pool for roughhousing. There were 13 of them, I'm guessing ages 10-14. They immediately jumped into the baby pool, where there were about 20 kids under 5 there. \n\nThey immediately started playing tackle football not far from us. I gave them some space, but my son got hit in the head with the ball. I told them to be careful, there were little ones in the pool, then I moved to the opposite side to give them space. \n\nFive minutes later, we were back in the middle of their game, and I got elbowed. We moved again, sitting literally underneath the lifeguard. They kept playing rough, and I saw them push a little girl, maybe 3 years old under the water. The parents told the lifeguard, who didn't react to it at all. They ended up leaving. I saw four more babies get hit by the ball and the kids chasing it, and this group was taking up the entire baby pool.  It wasn't safe for the littles, so all of the parents ended up taking their kiddos out. \n\nNow, here's where I might be TA. My son was throwing a fit because he wanted to stay in the pool, and I'm worn out between teething and the growth spurt he's been in. I yelled at the kids that they needed to get out of the baby pool. I ended up taking my son to the lazy river to splash instead, but they called me a bitch and a Karen, and told me to mind my own business. \n\nI know Reddit isn't super friendly towards parents, but my husband thinks I should have gone to the lifeguard. That's fair, but I know she was watching and should have spoke up. I was raised by Karen's, so I'm trying my best not to become one.

The lifeguard should have kicked those kids out entirely.", "Nta, it's a baby pool for a reason, not a pre-teen pool", "The lifeguard actively put little children in danger by not kicking the tweens out of the pool area. OP is in the right to go off on the kids for ruining something for little kids.", "NTA - the clue is in the name - BABY pool.   \nIf my 1 year old kid  had got hit by a ball from kids being rough in the baby pool who were there because they were too rough for the main pool there would have been a lot of shouting going on - and a formal complaint to management about an incompetent lifeguard", "NTA and that lifeguard needs to be reported. The first priority of a lifeguard is safety and the SECOND your son got hit in the head with a football (even if it wasn\u2019t a hard hit) the kids should have been kicked out of the pool and your son evaluated", "You're nicer than I am. Your baby got hit with a ball. Teens don't belong in the baby pool. They were kicked out of the big pool for a reason.", "NTA and you probably handled it way better than I would\u2019ve and I\u2019m not even a parent. In your defense, you yelled at them because the lifeguard was watching but clearly wasn\u2019t doing shit.", "NTA You\u2019re right, there are many entitled parents out there. In this case however, you were well within your reason to ask these older kids to leave the baby pool. I\u2019m actually shocked that no one said anything sooner. There are designated pools for a reason- safety. I\u2019d probably take it up a notch and call the aquatics director of the facility- the lifeguard handled this situation very poorly.", "NTA", "The lifeguard didn\u2019t do their job. You should have reported this to management immediately. Those kids need to be banned, they are a danger to the littles.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nWhat a shit lifeguard. What if that 3 year old drowned or was injured?", "Especially where they pushed a little girl under the water. At the pool I go to that would have resulted in a ban for the rest of the season at least. OP really should complain to pool management; these kids were an active danger to everyone in the pool, themselves included, and that lifeguard should have booted the lot of them.", "I would have zero patience if my child got hit with the ball and would have screamed at them immediately.", "Worked at a pool for a long time. Parents will drop off their 12-15 year olds and just straight up leave. We had to ban several families one year bc their kids sucked so hard", "No clue where the older kids parents where. I got the impression they were all dropped off for some kind of party", "I'm thinking about calling tomorrow to talk to the manager but I feel like I should have done it then. I just had too much going on with the baby screaming and getting everyone dressed and ready to go", "What I don't get is the pool was part of a park. They could have walked over to the field, played football and came back with no issues", "Not just the babies but the safety of the rough housing kids as well. A 4\u2019 deep pool provides a lot more cushion for falls than a 2\u2019 deep pool does and one wrong fall could easily crack a head open.", "Yeah. No way I would have let it go any further", "You absolutely should call them tomorrow. Talk to the aquatics director if you can. I worked at a pool for 10 years and this would never fly, they need to retrain staff asap"]}
