Being one, he can't swim, so I sat in the baby pool and let him do his thing.\n\nThe way this pool is set up, I sat in the deepest part of the baby pool. The water was maybe 2 feet deep, and my son was standing on my lap. Behind me was a walkway, then the big kid pool. (4 feet deep) \n\nI heard the lifeguard shouting, and she kicked a group of kids out of the big kid pool for roughhousing. There were 13 of them, I'm guessing ages 10-14. They immediately jumped into the baby pool, where there were about 20 kids under 5 there. \n\nThey immediately started playing tackle football not far from us. I gave them some space, but my son got hit in the head with the ball. I told them to be careful, there were little ones in the pool, then I moved to the opposite side to give them space. \n\nFive minutes later, we were back in the middle of their game, and I got elbowed. We moved again, sitting literally underneath the lifeguard. They kept playing rough, and I saw them push a little girl, maybe 3 years old under the water. The parents told the lifeguard, who didn't react to it at all. They ended up leaving. I saw four more babies get hit by the ball and the kids chasing it, and this group was taking up the entire baby pool.  It wasn't safe for the littles, so all of the parents ended up taking their kiddos out. \n\nNow, here's where I might be TA. My son was throwing a fit because he wanted to stay in the pool, and I'm worn out between teething and the growth spurt he's been in. I yelled at the kids that they needed to get out of the baby pool. I ended up taking my son to the lazy river to splash instead, but they called me a bitch and a Karen, and told me to mind my own business. \n\nI know Reddit isn't super friendly towards parents, but my husband thinks I should have gone to the lifeguard. That's fair, but I know she was watching and should have spoke up. I was raised by Karen's, so I'm trying my best not to become one.
