This also happened last summer, but I'm curious if I was wrong for this.\n\nMy fiance (26) and I (22) have been together for 4 years.\nMy fiance's sister Emma (28) has been with her new husband (M28) For 11 years.\n\n\nEmma's engagement is a touchy subject, because Emma's husband did a crappy engagement. She had been pushing for him to propose for years and when he finally did it, it was on a random night in the middle of a park, and everyone could tell it was a bit half assed. But Emma is one to make things work, so no one really mentions it to her.\n\nAt the wedding, I was approached by some of my fiance's family about my engagement. My fiance and I were engaged at the time, and so I told them how he did it. I didn't really want to mention it but since they asked I figured I'd say. My fiance created a video going over our relationship and played it to me before proposing , which was very sweet. I showed them the video and they all gushed about how wonderful it was. Emma overheard , and later pulled me aside and told me she did NOT appreciate me bringing up my engagement at her wedding.\n\nShe called me selfish and told me that I could've picked any other time to show them the video. I apologized but mentioned that they specifically asked me and I didn't want to refuse and make it awkward. And tbh I don't feel like it's my fault that Emma didn't like her engagement. \n\nShe stormed off and told her family what I did, so things were awkward for a while. We invited her to our wedding in June of next year and she still technically hasn't accepted the invitation.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: I mentioned my engagement at my future sister in laws wedding. The family asked and I felt rude saying no. Future SIL got upset because she didn't like her engagement , and pulled me aside to call me out. I apologized but said I don't feel like it's my fault since they specifically asked me for the video.

You didn't *mention* your engagement at her wedding, you conducted a video review with more than one person in attendance. That's a little much do to at someone's wedding or reception.

Guests are meant to talk amongst themselves about whatever they want to....including positive things in their lives. I have no idea what 99% of people were talking about at my wedding at any given time...I'm sure people were talking about engagements, babies, jobs, other positive and negative life events. \n\n\nBut you were actively showing the video in a situation where she overheard, knowing that she was self conscious about it. You weren't just talking, you had a bunch of people staring at your phone, gushing. You weren't being subtle or private at all.\n\n\nPersonally, calling it \"half assed\" also seems pretty rude and like you think your relationship is better. A private proposal in the park sounds way more appealing to me.", "YTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t just mention it, you showed them the fricking video! Time and place OP! Time and place!", "YTA.

It was already known and people asked you about the proposal. You answered. And THEN you brought out the video.\n\nSince you know Emma is sensitive about her proposal, it would have been kinder to be very low-key about yours AT HER WEDDING and all. You could have predicted her reaction.\n\nBut the reason I\u2019m going to call you TA is that you didn\u2019t sincerely apologize.

However, please continue to try mending bridges, even if Emma may be still angry. You know her engagement is a touchy matter, so you kinda accidentally pushed a trigger point, but as I said, NTA because you did apologise, meaning you acknowledge your mistake and triggered the matter. However, your defense about it not being your fault that Emma doesn't like her engagement is bringing you RATHER dangerously close to being TA. Careful with the next steps you take - your NTA status, the way I see it, is on rather thin ice.", "YTA. You could have showed the over the top proposal video at literally any other time.

You went a bit too far showing the video when you knew how Emma felt about her own proposal.  That could have waited.  Or you could have presented the video at your own wedding reception instead of doing it at her event.\n\nEmma didn't have to get so angry at you once she found out you weren't the one who brought it up, but only engaged in conversation after you were asked about it.  \n\nAnd Emma's husband should have put a bit more effort into the proposal or at least given her a proposal she would have liked.  Not everyone has the same tastes.  \n\nMy husband did it exactly how I wanted.  He did it in private and on one knee.  It was no big thing, and there was no special date or plan and I had warned him I didn't want it to be public in any way.  I loved it.  I think back on that moment and smile.  I wouldn't give a crap if someone else talked about their big deal proposal at my wedding because I was all smiles that day.  I was so happy to be getting married and nothing any of my guests said would bring me down.  \n\nBut the wedding was bittersweet for other reasons.  A few guests we really wanted to attend couldn't because of the pandemic.  We still did a video stream though and had some of our loved ones watch it that way.  \n\nA wedding should be a happy occasion.  The bride and groom should be happy.
