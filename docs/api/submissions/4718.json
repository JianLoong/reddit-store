This also happened last summer, but I'm curious if I was wrong for this.\n\nMy fiance (26) and I (22) have been together for 4 years.\nMy fiance's sister Emma (28) has been with her new husband (M28) For 11 years.\n\n\nEmma's engagement is a touchy subject, because Emma's husband did a crappy engagement. She had been pushing for him to propose for years and when he finally did it, it was on a random night in the middle of a park, and everyone could tell it was a bit half assed. But Emma is one to make things work, so no one really mentions it to her.\n\nAt the wedding, I was approached by some of my fiance's family about my engagement. My fiance and I were engaged at the time, and so I told them how he did it. I didn't really want to mention it but since they asked I figured I'd say. My fiance created a video going over our relationship and played it to me before proposing , which was very sweet. I showed them the video and they all gushed about how wonderful it was. Emma overheard , and later pulled me aside and told me she did NOT appreciate me bringing up my engagement at her wedding.\n\nShe called me selfish and told me that I could've picked any other time to show them the video. I apologized but mentioned that they specifically asked me and I didn't want to refuse and make it awkward. And tbh I don't feel like it's my fault that Emma didn't like her engagement. \n\nShe stormed off and told her family what I did, so things were awkward for a while. We invited her to our wedding in June of next year and she still technically hasn't accepted the invitation.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: I mentioned my engagement at my future sister in laws wedding. The family asked and I felt rude saying no. Future SIL got upset because she didn't like her engagement , and pulled me aside to call me out. I apologized but said I don't feel like it's my fault since they specifically asked me for the video.

You weren't just talking, you had a bunch of people staring at your phone, gushing.

Not everyone has the same tastes.  \n\nMy husband did it exactly how I wanted.  He did it in private and on one knee.  It was no big thing, and there was no special date or plan and I had warned him I didn't want it to be public in any way.  I loved it.  I think back on that moment and smile.  I wouldn't give a crap if someone else talked about their big deal proposal at my wedding because I was all smiles that day.

It is quite possible that her engagement is what was appropriate for her relationship, as not everyone needs a spectacle. \n\nIt is okay to confirm your engagement and happiness, but pulling out your phone to show people who ask at the wedding is not the time or place- it is tacky.

Had to whip out that video, didn't you, you just HAD to because other people were rude to ask to see it and so it's ok to join in? You could have been the quiet hero here.... But I bet you're not that type just normally, based on your judgemental mentioning of her proposal. It only makes you look worse. \n\nYou were fully aware that it would pull focus to do what you did, which is why you didn't mention anything initially.

Asks me to make him the happiest man in the world by agreeing to marry him.

It was fine to briefly talk about being engaged, but showing a video?", "I think that depends on how she showed the video. If she had it on her phone and just passed it over discretely, that's not too bad.

You act like you\u2019re innocent, and they were forcing you to talk about your engagement and show the video, but I think you did it on purpose and were loving the attention.
