While I'm not of Asian heritage, my Mum also views me as a child (I'm in my 30s) and an extension of herself that she owns. Your Mum won't change if you move out or not, but at least if you move out you're living your life for you and don't have to put you up with her constant judgement.\n\nI'm proud of you for achieving your goals, you're allowed to live independently. Good luck.", "NTA, you need to move out and your mum to find another meaning in her life.", "NTA, and I think your mom needs some serious therapy.", "NTA. This sounds like a cultural expectation, from what I know of my friends with a similar background. \n\nIt is healthy and okay for you to live your life on your own terms, away from your Mom\u2019s home.", "NTA \n\nAs an Indian, I can relate to this. A lot of Asian parents are basically helicopter parents. They feel they need to be able to manage their child's life until they die. A lot of parents also struggle to accept the fact that their child is an adult now, and no longer needs their parents to help them make decisions. By moving out, your mother is now being forced to face the reality she's been denying for years. \n\nAsian parents are always over dramatic. Your mother will be upset at first, but she will get over it once she's become used to your living on your own.  It isn't unreasonable for a married woman in her thirties to not want to live with her mother anymore. You will want to start your own family one day and you need your own space to do that without interfering grandma hovering over your kids.", "NTA, you deserve to be happy and live in your own home. don\u2019t let anyone slow you down.", "NTA \u2014 it will be better for you mentally to move out. Your life, your choices. She needs to learn to live her life by not latching onto you 24/7. As someone of Asian descent, moving out was better for me and my mother\u2019s relationship versus if I stayed.", "**NTA**, your mother should get some help. You have every right to move out and start your own life with your husband.", "Nta\n\nYour mom has empty nest problems, get her counseling. Idk if she will be against it, as maybe culturally she sees multi-generational homes as a good standard. \n\nWhatever her beliefs or expectations - you\u2019re not the AH for wanting to move out. She\u2019s just going to have to process this. Wishing you the best", "Nta. There's a lot of red flags there. Move out and build your own life. Regardless of whatever anyone tells you, you only have 1 life, its not a rehearsal and you deserve happiness", "NTA. I've heard quite a few stories of parents who have kids, so they have someone to stay with them and look after them as they get older.", "Sounds like cultural differences. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.", "ESH but leaning toward NTA.  \nThis one is hard. For one, you don't really owe your parents anything. I get it. You have your own life to live and it makes sense to move out with your husband and start your own lives.  \nOn the other hand your mom's culture (Chinese) is based around family. A lot of families live together. It's not unusual for grand parents to live with their children and grand children. This might be a total culture shock for your mom and in her eyes it might be the equivalent of abandonment, regardless of your intentions.  \nI don't think there's any right or wrong here. Your mom is probably going to be devastated and probably depressed if/when you leave. Maybe that's just part of life and she needs to just get over it. Or maybe you should consider her feelings and make the sacrifice for her. Maybe your mom will be completely alone after you leave because she staked everything on you. Tough call. Just know leaving will completely devastate your mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There comes a time when every child needs to grow up and start their own life. No matter how close or far away you choose to live from your mum, you're always going to be her daughter, and yeah it can be draining, but you just need to help her see that.\n\nYou've been doing a great job by involving her, asking her for advice. But it doesn't seem like she's ready to be that kind of parent yet.\n\nI don't know what the dynamic is like, but maybe you and your partner could take her out to dinner, and you can talk with her about this next big step in your life?\n\nIt might be hard to have a direct conversation about your mother-daughter relationship, but you can definitely try to reframe it and help her see that you still need her and she's still your mum.\n\nJust now she's the mother to an adult daughter and not a little girl, and you're seeking guidance in different ways.\n\nIt also might be worth taking a break from visiting her physically, just to get used to not having you around. If you have any important documents, like a birth certificate, that's still at her house, you should take this opportunity to ask or take it into your own possession.\n\nScheduled phone calls may help. Sending things in the mail, or bringing over some food, and helping her come up with a plan to renovate or redecorate and occupy the space you had in her home are good ideas also.\n\nThe key thing is you don't want her to have a shrine dedicated to you, with hopes that you'll come home. If there are any hobbies that you share (crafting, plants, cooking?), repurposing your old bedroom in that way can be a sweet way to commemorate your presence whilst still allowing her to see and recognise this change in your lives.\n\nAll the best! Parents are tough sometimes. Hang in there.", "NTA. Live your dream.", "NTA.\n\nWhen a parent views you as their puppet, trying to live independently isn\u2019t received well.

You're an adult, and have the right to live your own life.", "NTA but I get your struggle. In my 20s and 30s I had flaming rows with my mum, who I\u2019m very close to, because of her expectations that I should never want to move away from family. Which I did, to the other side of the continent. We talk every day, and visit every couple months and I have my husband and a child on the way - one that she will be very involved with and stay with us as much as she wants. Things work out eventually I think, but change is hard for our parents. However things like living with them should never come from obligation in my view, they either develop naturally or they don\u2019t, and both should be ok as long as all parties make an effort to keep relationships alive and well regardless of living arrangements. \n\nPlus why do you think she kept her disappointment quiet for a while? I\u2019m sure she knows that what she wants is not what you want, or ever wanted maybe. She blew up at you - that is not great but you can understand her feelings I think. What wouldn\u2019t be acceptable is if she continued to guilt trip you into giving up your life plans, especially if you can address her fears around loneliness etc. \n\nPlus, doesnt your husband have a say around where you all live and with who?", "Yes, you do have a choice but you might need therapy to realize it. You are NTA and you and your husband need to move out asap and only see/interact with your mom when YOU want to. She will survive.", "Thank you :)", "Question:   Why is this so common in Asian families?   I know it happens occasionally in other cultural groups but not so consistently \n\nMy Scottish-Irish self was really happy to see my adult children launch!", "To be fair, it was hypocritical of her considering she moved out with my dad in the house where I grew up in.", "That is a ridiculous guilt trip to put on someone who as an ADULT would like to live their own life. Mom has no right to ask or expect her child to sacrifice her own independence for her. Mom is definitely the AH, cultural expectations or not.", "I've wondered this too. Americans get a lot of crap about how we're too independent but this dynamic seems really odd and unhealthy to me.", "It can stem from the financial need to keep the family together for longer. In many Asian countries, housing compared to wages is extremely high and makes it much harder to leave the nest. It's very common for married couples to live with their parents.", "Probably. Perhaps this is karma. Maybe it's only decades later she has a chance to reflect on the decisions she's made.  \nBut it's everyone's first time and everyone's only chance at living life. These things happen. Maybe this is one of those life lessons you only learn through experience. Maybe it's only when you have your own kids and they're ready to move on that you'll reflect and regret. And your kids might say the exact same thing about you moving out in the here and now while you try and convince them to stay because your family is all you have left in your old age.  \nWho knows. It's a rough call IMO. I know it's only when I was older that I reflected on how much of a SOB I was to my parents in my youth and how much they sacrificed for me. They were a bit controlling and demeaning at times but like I said, it's everyone's first time. They weren't perfect. I couldn't wait to leave home and be on my own when I was younger. Everyone has their own experiences but I personally feel indebted to my parents. Not everyone shares the same sentiment.   \nDo what you gotta do."]}
