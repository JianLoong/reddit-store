But your mum 100% made it harder by getting a dog. I wouldn't be shocked if she was already thinking she would just live with you forever when she got the dog. \n\nWhich state you're in also makes the dog situation better or worse when trying to rent. You're not an asshole for wanting to start your life with your partner, and renting to her while using the house for equity to build with your partner sounds like the closest to a middle ground you will get. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA but you will be if you let this entitled moocher keep on swindling you.
