I feel like that goes without saying.\n\nBut you can't control how people react to your gifts.

An $80 gift is more than enough, your husband\u2019s family seem to be materialistic. SIL is not appreciative & sounds very entitled.

She didn't want make up, she didn't ask for make up. Is it even in her shade? Colors she likes etc?? \n\nIn the end I think ESH, you more so than her.

Is your gift the only one she didn't put away?", "NTA. If she isn\u2019t getting you a present, it\u2019s deliberate. Trust me, if she\u2019s able to support herself, she clearly has some form of income, and even if she doesn\u2019t, she could ask her parents for $20 to buy you a box of chocolates.", "YTA. You don't know how she feels about her gift. Some people don't put things away right away. You're visiting your SIL multiple days, her gift from you is out on display for multiple days. It's a non issue.\n\nYou're making a chicken out of a feather.", "NAH. Whether or not to give a gift and the size of it is strictly for the giver to decide. The recipient can do whatever they like with a gift and has no obligation to appreciate it. There's nothing unreasonable about not gifting someone for any reason, but lack of appreciation for previous gifts would be an acceptable one if a reason is needed.", "YTA. She literally thanked you and it's only been three days. How was she ungrateful? I am not sure where the assumption comes from that leaving a gift on the counter is a purposeful action or one that is \"rude\". I forgot to take most of my Christmas gifts upstairs for at least four. It's not because I didn't appreciate them or wasn't excited to use them, I just literally forgot. Also I doubt that she would expect you to buy a $250 gift for her- it seems like that was your husband's assumption and not her statement. \n\nThe lack of reciprocation is most likely 100% due to the fact that she doesn't have a job. Even a gesture is usually about $10, which may not seem a lot to you but adds up once you include every other person she would now owe a \"gesture\" too. \n\nAlso as you said, they are a close family and you like them- is this really the hill you want to die on? Not getting her a gift next year will be clearly intentional and create unnecessary drama and animosity. You are only three years in.

Is this part of a larger pattern where she treats you differently?", "I\u2019ve learned the hard way not to put my expectations of gratitude on other people. A gift should be given freely and from the heart not with strings attached. So when people don\u2019t express their gratitude the way I have feel they should in the past I now know to take my feelings out of the equation. The only time I react or refuse to gifts in the future is if they do not take the time to at least say thank you! I\u2019d your SIL has said thank you, leave her alone. Are you willing to cause hard feelings in the future with FIL/MIL over this? This is a bitter hill to die on!", "Slight AH. I understand you\u2019re disappointed because you tried to get her something you thought she might like and now you\u2019re feeling like she didn\u2019t really like the gift. It\u2019s ok to feel hurt. However, it\u2019s a gift and by definition should be given without expectations. Getting her nothing at all next year will show you to be petty and not really giving in the true sense of the word. Maybe rather than getting vengeful you could try finding out what she might want if it\u2019s in budget get it. \n\n\nThe other thing I noticed: you seem to be a bit insecure regarding the expense of gifts given. I get that as I have some of that too. However I\u2019ve come to learn my attitude towards that is more a function of my insecurity as a child of poverty, not that people expect me to reciprocate. \nI now try to give good, nice thoughtful gifts and hope they\u2019re liked.

I don't want or need another recipe book with folders and blank pages for me to write out recipes - I have a system that I've been using for decades, same to novelty measuring spoons in the shape of flowers, or cutsie baking tins that make 4 little cakes in the shape of birds and only use 11% of a recipe of batter. I'm never going to make any of the mediocre basic things in a recipe book titled \"30 quick and easy bakes for beginners\". And I don't want to act grateful for this instant landfill because it will just encourage people to get me more instant landfill.\n\nIn fact, I have so much baking stuff that I genuinely I don't need any gifts for that hobby. But if someone was struggling to think of something for me and gave me a set of perforated pastry rings or a coffee table book of Parisian entremets, I would be grateful.\n\nWe don't know for sure if OP nailed a gift that SIL would genuinely like even though it wasn't on her list but if she did then this passive aggressive show of rejecting it because she wanted something more expensive is poor behaviour.", "That\u2019s true. There\u2019s been plenty of times I\u2019ve just left Christmas/birthday presents out in common areas after opening. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want/like the thing I was given, sometimes it\u2019s just me being lazy or I\u2019m leaving it there so I remember where I put it when I am ready to mess with/look at it.

I\u2019ve only ever found one brand of sunscreen (and it\u2019s not the most expensive one) that works for my face. I would be petrified if anyone besides my mom bought me skincare of any kind because she\u2019s the only one who knows exactly what works for me and what I\u2019m allergic to (after years of me trying something, breaking out in hives, and having to give it back to her to use herself or return)", "This.

OP is very judgmental about the amount of money her husband\u2019s family chooses to spend on gifts. It\u2019s none of her business his parents want to buy their children expensive gifts.

OP is not upset about SIL\u2019s reaction when she received the gift, but she\u2019s upset about the place SIL placed the gift after receiving it. And OP thinks she has the authority to ask SIL to put away the gifts (asking if SIL \u201cforgot\u201d the gift is passive aggressive). She made a problem of something that wasn\u2019t a problem and her reaction is overdramatic.\n\nGiving someone a gift doesn\u2019t mean you control what the other person does with it or you can demand where they keep it.

If she only left one gift there, I'd say it was not wanting the gift\n\nI wouldn't fully agree with this either. If I ask for something I need as a gift, there is a much higher chance that I will start using it right after I receive it. I asked, because I need/want, right? On the contrary, if I get something I don't immediately need, it will take me longer to find it a place/use.\n\nIt's true that if you *feel* your gifts are not appreciated, you don't have to give. But it can also be accepted as rude and you get all the consequences of it. I like best the idea that OP and her husband should start give gifts as a couple and the husband should be the one to choose for his family.", "I don't disagree with you but side note are you the sister In law?"]}
