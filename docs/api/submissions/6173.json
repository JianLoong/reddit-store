I feel like that goes without saying.\n\nBut you can't control how people react to your gifts.

An $80 gift is more than enough, your husband\u2019s family seem to be materialistic. SIL is not appreciative & sounds very entitled.

She didn't want make up, she didn't ask for make up. Is it even in her shade? Colors she likes etc?? \n\nIn the end I think ESH, you more so than her.

Unless you\u2019re close enough to know what your recipient has been lusting after or they request something specific, go with a gift card. And if you must buy a physical present, include a gift receipt.\n\nI think other commenter\u2019s suggestions to exchange gifts with each other\u2019s families as a couple is a really good one.

It really helps to listen & get them gift cards or obscure mementos *they like, not you.* We as a family struggled at times due to illnesses, particularly my mother as injured her back on the job. Feast/famine situations. Times could be plentiful got gifts galore, and other times stretching so tight to get to the New Year didn't get any gifts. It bothered her that her siblings would not gift if we couldn't gift knowing we were struggling.\n\nMy mother absolutely loved everything about Christmas, decorations, music, festivity, food, cookies & window shopping\n\nMeanwhile I was a typical teen that was moody & was the opposite of my mother. She used to call me \"*Ms. Grinch*\". Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Christmas but not at the feverish enthusiastic pitch as my mother. I'd be embarrassed going out with her at times.\n\n**My mother loved Christmas & angels.**\n\nOur Christmas tree & the walls were decorated with angels. I lost count of all the angel decorations.\n\nShe used to drag me out as a teenager, as she enjoyed going out to the mall to see the festive decorations. (*This was before malls cut back on holiday displays. They used to be so elaborate & colorful*). Wherever there was Christmas music, she hummed & then 'get' me grumpily to join along with the music. We became a comedy act being silly it was so infectious complete strangers started humming & singing along! Once had an entire lines at the cash registers were singing with us the Twelve Days of Christmas! We laughed afterwards & applauded each other (*proof the many Christmas recitals at school remained in our brains*).\n\nI don't know if couldn't see me at my age, thought of me as a child I don't know. She was bad. Uh, she wasn't the best in buying gifts (I'm 5'10\" and was over 150lbs. She'd buy underwear for petite too small I couldn't get a leg in, or bigger plus women too large the pants fell off). There were times she bought the exact gift but forgot about it the year before. I learned about allergies from her buying me stuff I'm allergic to (sweaters of a certain material) and one time perfume (luckily her & my aunt are both nurses started breaking out in hives).\n\nI tore through the entire house when she wasn't looking like a spy to figure out my gifts. She was on a limited disability. I didn't want her to feel bad, so would practice & prepare myself for her gifts.\n\n**My mother was such a prankster.**\n\nOne year, I thought I knew what I was getting. I was a teenager (*Santa concept was behind me or so I thought*). We had opened up all of our gifts I knew exactly what I was got as pretended to be a secret agent & had scooped out the house.\n\nThen she told me to go upstairs to get a gift for a relative forgot to bring down that was in one of the bedrooms. When I came downstairs, there was a Schwinn 10-speed 'bright yellow' bike. I was floored. I was speechless for like 10 minutes. In the back of my mind, \"*Where on earth was this hiding? I scoured the entire house & this was here all along*?\" Turned out we had what's considered a classic car now. It was a used 1971 Buick 225 Electra. They hid it in the huge trunk from my known scooping which I thought was covert.\n\nException of that surprise still had gifts were off. I was an annual frequent customer at the returns, they knew & waved at me. I decided to help her out by giving her a \"*List for Santa*\" that I used for years. It listed practical to the extravagant (as a joke). Such as my sizes (shoe, underwear, sweater, jean & sock sizes), sweaters, jeans & other clothing (what store, price, color & item number) along with wanting the extravagant (jokingly) a trip to Greece & a purple Lamborghini (we both loved cars). Over the years, the sizes changed but the extravagant stayed the same.\n\nIt helped! Santa started buying me everything in the right sizes! I was amazed & grateful. One year after I *thought* had gotten everything, she held something in her hands, then told me it was my last gift for the year. ***I opened it up & it was a purple Lamborghini mini-scale model in detail! She told me \"That I couldn't tell her that she didn't buy me a Lamborghini for Christmas!\" It's still with me from many years ago. It's one of my cherished possessions. She passed in 2006.***\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KdO5i4h.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KdO5i4h.jpg)\n\nI was on assignment in San Diego.

Weekend comes, spur of the moment (*don't know what possessed me as sleep in if get a chance not working*), got dressed & went there. Figured wasn't going to get a dog but go pet & give some loving to a dog.\n\nFirst, I saw a German Shepherd 6 months old puppy. While sitting in the visitor's pen attempted to get its attention to pet it, but it was too interested in playing with a ball. I was ready to leave disappointed & happened to see this dog sitting calmly in its cage next to a very aggressive dog that kept barking & lounging at people. I asked if could see the calm dog (which was a corgi/lab; taller than a corgi, shorter than a lab).\n\n*I sat in the visitor pen & this dog the minute he came into the pen, went straight up to me & put his head on my lap.* Needless to say, he came home with me that very day. He was so loyal & loving to both me along with my 'Garfield' cat for over 7 years. They eventually became buddy-buddy. My dog passed suddenly last year from a diabetic seizure. *Although a pet, it stabbed me in the heart losing him. I miss him so much at during the holidays.*\n\nThe pound's customer service agent, I found out later, was mispronouncing the dog's name. When got home, I tried unsuccessfully to call the dog to come to me. He didn't look at me or do anything. Dog was friendly but wasn't responding at all. So looked up his name. It's Malachi & means *angel*\\*\\*\\*. I got a chill realizing that my mother reached out to me & gave me an angel.\\*\\*\\* Started correctly pronouncing his name came to me like that.\n\n([https://i.imgur.com/7SZAJdj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7SZAJdj.jpg)\n\nWhen Christmas comes, I am flooded with all the memories of the past including my mother, close friends & my dog that passed on. ***I barely remember what I bought them & they me.*** It the memories that keep me company as I age.\n\nI admit recognized my grief will never subside over a loss, it won't fade into oblivion as many think rather becomes wonderful, bittersweet memories. A Christmas song, smell of cologne/perfume, a movie, or food/cookies, even seeing decorated Christmas trees can trigger me back to a moment spent time with them.

You\u2019re entitled to feel however you want but it\u2019s over-the-top to go this ballistic.", "NTA", "YTA, you\u2019re a little weird for being so obsessive about what your husbands sister thinks of your gift.", "I don\u2019t think you are the AH. You brought her something nice and she is being unreasonable. Why aren\u2019t people brought up to be appreciative aunt gifts given them. I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything ever again.", "The better response would be for the husband to buy presents for his side of the family, especially his ungrateful AH sister who doesn't even have a job so doesn't buy anything for anyone. I can't imagine being so rude to my brother's girlfriend like this. My brother (and parents) would quite rightly ream me out.", "Or a pet.", "She's studying. If she doesn't live at home, she might just be leaving it out to take back with her after break.", "All I would say to hour husband is that\n\n\u201cYou sir are an asshole who coddles a grown ass woman. Walk yourself to the door and get a reality check before coming back in.\u201d", "She's probably leaving it out so that she knows where it is. My wife and I do this all the time with small things.", "Here's the thing.  You gave her a gift and she said thank you.   She doesn't have to actually like it or use it.   Maybe it's not the reaction that you wanted but the point was that she said thank you and you now move on!   She wasn't ungrateful or anything... She just didn't put it away.\n\nYou gave her a gift and what she does with it is none of your business.", "So... she CAN appreciate the small things.  She just (maybe) did not love the thing you picked out.\n\nLike, it happens.  Move on.  You are overreacting.", "I also didn't see a mention in the post about whether SIL likes that kind of makeup, or even *wears* makeup! There have been several times people have gifted me scented lotions, which give me a migraine usually. I smile, say thank you, and set it aside. After the holidays I give it to a friend that I know likes that kind of thing. Am I rude for not slathering myself in it immediately and just gritting my teeth through the inevitable migraine? Giant NTA.", "She could have taken it to her room rather than just leaving it where she opened it. She showed no appreciation at all. And yes, when I get makeup for a gift I do open it up and look at the colors. What OP was saying is she disregarded the gift, it's not about playing dress up!", "I think this is a stretch. I juuuuust put away my gifts, including a new purse I was dying for and love. The holidays are overwhelming and sometimes it just takes time to put stuff away. Doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s ungrateful.", "All of your gifts, or just the gifts from one person while everything else is put away?", "Oh my god. Are organized doom piles a thing? You just described my life. \n\nAnd yeah I still haven\u2019t put away my Xmas gifts. They\u2019re in a doom pile on my end table next to the couch.", "I\u2019m astounded at the comments excusing the SIL, when OP\u2019s husband is the one who told her she\u2019s probably because SIL wanted the $250 gift. \n\nSIL knows what she\u2019s doing and is basically giving OP a big FU.", "Yes, that's exactly what we do. When you're a couple, I'd find it odd to give two sets of presents out.", "lots of ppl with Adhd have their own system, this isn\u2019t it. it\u2019s a spoiled brat upset she didn\u2019t get a 200 gift", "YTA. Never buy someone else makeup, unless they have given you a wishlist in advance. There are so many variables to consider, it's like a minefield. If you do buy such things, be sure to give them a gift receipt and specifically say you expect them to exchange it for something they like or suits them better.\n\nAnd that's before we get into issues around mental health, self-esteem, body-shaming, forced gendering, sexism, and even sexual harassment and bullying around expecting women to look any kind of way. This isn't anyone's fault, but society puts a lot of pressure on people to conform to gender roles, and many people have trauma.\n\nHonestly, you might have been better off giving her the cash or a gift card. She could have put the money towards the gift/items she really wanted or needed.", "NTA", "If you get her anything next.  I would give her a Visa gift card, not to give her anything personalized.  Personally I would just get her a card.", "YTA. If everyone that gave me things got mad at me because during the holidays I didn't put them away for a few days, I'd have nobody left! Holidays are busy and weird and different than normal days. She said thank you. Just because she isn't behaving exactly as you think she should doesn't mean she's ungrateful.\n\nETA: Also? It seems like you only think she didn't like the gift because of an assumption your husband made. Not exactly hard evidence.", "NTA.  She sounds spoiled.  Who asks for. $250 gift?  Why are you buying all the gifts for your husband\u2019s family?  That\u2019s his job.", "ESH\n\nYou dont get to dictate how someone else is supposed to feel about a gift. SIL smiled and thanked you, thats quite enough of gratitude shown. \n\nAnd on the other hand, I wouldnt be getting her gifts after this either. ESPECIALLY since she hasnt given any to you at all. You give nothing, you receive nothing.", "YTA. Stop making drama.  She accepted the gift said thank you.  Whether she put it away is not enough of a thing to be making problems with your husband.  You\u2019re just pissed that as you say it was a well thought out gift that was just left out. Next year $50 gift card and done especially since she doesn\u2019t get you anything nor has the money to get you anything", "Look. The thing about gifts is that they are given and that's the end of it. As long as you put the thought into it that's enough. It doesn't matter after.\n\nI recall a story about my sister getting mad at my dad giving a gift she gave him away. And what he said to her was: \" Honey, I give the gifts to me that mean the mostr\u00f3 me, to the people that mean me the most\"", "YTA. You give a person a gift and that\u2019s it. What people do with the gift is their choice, because it\u2019s theirs. She said thanks, she wasn\u2019t ungrateful.", "op=NTA\n\nHusband is AH for calling you an AH.  Your SIL is not \"owed\" a gift period.\n\nYour SIL is a spoiled brat and doesn't deserve another gift--Tell hubby to buy the gifts for his family from now on.", "NTA\n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, but IMO, Christmas is for kids, not grown-ups. The most I get for the adults in my life are small, cheap things. I gave my parents/in-laws calendars with the kids' pictures on them this year ($14 at Wal-Mart). My BIL got a gift for my nephew, who is a kid and obviously in the kid category. My brother got a book ($10 with shipping). My husband and I don't give each other gifts. \n\nAnd you know what? NO ONE COMPLAINS. No one is disappointed that they \"only\" got a $150 gift and not a $250 gift. Jesus Christ, the absolute entitlement of some people. Your SIL would have gotten a big fat nothing from me and that's how she should be treated from here on out.", "Why?  These people are not your family.  No need to buy a separate gift.  Does your husband buy your family gifts just from him?  SIL obviously doesn\u2019t like you.", "Because it was obvious that it was intended as a slight", "What did he give her. NTA BTW. She obviously intended it as a slight", "you ASSUMED these items would be useful to her, which is nice and all, but it was an ASSUMPTION.   \nAgain, get her a store card and let her get what she wants/needs next time. She may have already gotten those items for herself or had no need for them. We'll never know and it's none of your business what she thinks or does with them since she thanked you for the gift.   \nGet over it and move on. I'm beginning to think my original assessment of ESH is YTA since you refuse to let it go.  This is really petty and it seems as though you're TRYING to make it more than it is on everyone else's end. Has it occurred to you that everyone SEEMS like they're being an AH to you because they're responding to how YOU are behaving?", "you know you can dislike a gift without being a blatant AH about it the SIL left it in the common area where everyone was going to be and see it, do it quietly", "Which means... nothing.  I currently have gifts lying all over my house.  I haven't put everything away yet. This is not some blatant sign that I hate the presents.  It's just laziness.  \n\nAgain, maybe she doesn't like the gift.  Maybe she hasn't put it away because she's just not thinking about it because she doesn't want it.  Maybe she is waiting for OP to leave so she can throw it in the trash.\n\nBut ALL she has done is smile and say thank you.  And not put the gift up yet. Calling her a blatant AH for that is quite the reach, based on a large overreaction from the OP about how the SIL should show \"more appreciation for the small things\" or else she deserves nothing.\n\nOP is definitely being the AH here.", "My family has a habit of leaving gifts on the table in the living room or in a corner of our family room until we finally get around to taking them to our rooms or wherever they go. I got a new puffer vest for Christmas, it's currently sitting on the couch in my living room where it will stay until either the weather gets cold enough again to wear it or someone lets me know they're stopping by and I realize I guess I should hang it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sticking up for the sister, clearly she's showing her disdain but not everyone that leaves things on counters are doing that.", "YTA, I hate when people give gifts that come with strings attached, including the expectation of some kind of performance of gratitude. They\u2019re her items now and she can do whatever she wants with them.", "NTA. This is a grown woman not a little kid. No adult should do what she is doing just because they didn't get what they wanted for Christmas. At the end of the day don't get her anything again. If your husband wants to them that's his right but I wouldn't spend my money on her.", "Who cares? You are the one keeping score.  What if she doesn\u2019t like them?  She smiled and said thank you.  What more do you want? \nYTA.", "So......you're mad that your SIL doesn't pick up her things when you wanted her to? In the week between Christmas and NYE when time is relative and people are just kicking back and enjoying life? Get over yourself. YTA.", "NTA, sure you can't blame her for treating your gift one way or another, it is hers to do with as she pleases. But you are entitled to saying that it was unsatisfying and that you'd rather skip the gift thing altogether.\nHonestly your husband can choose a gift for her if he thinks it's important. You are not punishing her, you are just taking care of yourself.", "ESH\n\nShe could be more grateful, but you are also overreacting", "NTA. She could have politely accepted/thanked you, and then returned the items. Most of that stuff comes in tamper-evident packaging. I\u2019d be offended, too. And would also refuse to give gifts to her in the future.\n\nAnd am I the only one who bought gifts from myself **and** my husband, to everyone on the gift list? It was always both of us giving each gift.", "Your SIL left those gifts out and wanted you to see them and you walked right into her trap by noting this to her. This was her passive aggressive way of saying, \u201cthanks for a gift I have no use for and next time listen more carefully and get me the gift I wanted.\u201d Rude? Yes. But take the power out of her rudeness by choosing to treat it as her problem, not your problem. Stay calm and ignore it. Obviously your SIL is an AH, but so is your husband. They sound entitled. \ud83d\udea9", "Sephora is tricky, unless you know which brand, color, scent she wants you would have been better off giving her a gift card. Rise above, learn from it, and accept you missed the mark and move on YTA", "I would totally get her a gift for next year. I would buy her a statue, a clock or something that can be put in the common area as decoration. I would give her this gift with the most sincere smile and sweetest voice I can muster up and say: \"Last year your gift was decorating this room all the time so that's why I thought that you would be happy with this. I hope you like it. Look, it even matches the curtains here\". That's my level of petty. \n\nNTA for feeling this way, OP, because your gift was indeed not appreciated.", "NTA. Maybe your husband should buy gifts for his own family.", "i totally agrees with this! op is this pressed bc SIL didn\u2019t fawn over the gift enough??? no \u201cdrama occurred.\u201d the twin peaks shirt i gifted my boyfriend is sitting across from me on our coffee table right now. he was ducking ecstatic about the shirt. not putting a gift away isn\u2019t a snub!!! AND as others said, makeup, skin care, grooming related items aren\u2019t the best gifts unless you 190% know what they like and use. esp if you\u2019re not close to them. hell, my own mom still got me the wrong dyson hair dryer for christmas even tho we had been talking about it for months lol.", "if i dont like a gift from a family member (which happens a lot bc sometimes in my family cant afford anything suuuper nice) i will not just abandon it kn the kitchen counter or something, i always say \"thank you so much! i needed that!\" bc even if its not expensive, that person didnt need to gift me anything, but they still did, and im grateful they even thought about me\nif i dont like the gift, i can do whatever i want with it, but not in front of the person who gave me the gift, bc its disrespectful, she could've been more polite about it", "Hi, did you know that when adults say that another adult three a tantrum, it often actually means they were upset and acting like emotionally unreasonable adult?  Sometimes, people _employ_ a more liberal or lenient use of a word, and then that expands use of the word.  \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a", "I actually got a palette I already own for Christmas, which is totally my fault for owning so very many and I certainly would not expect anyone to know what makeup I already have. When I put away my gifts I did enthusiastically put it away into my box of things to donate/give away. \ud83d\ude02 so yeah putting things away quickly, not always a good sign. But I also put away the things that were new to me, I just....put stuff away...I don't see what the timing of that has to do with liking a gift", "I think this sounds like a lovely gift! The fact that you got her anything at all (especially when she never gets you a gift) is super generous. You even got stuff from a store you knew she likes, which shows that you spent extra time & effort on making sure it would be a personalized gift. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.\n\nI\u2019m speaking generally here, but when did it become normal/justified to be rude (or indifferent) when someone gets you a gift you don\u2019t like? Manners are so important. Even if you hate a gift, you always smile & say thank you. That\u2019s basic politeness. No one is ever required to give anyone a gift (especially when it\u2019s not immediate family). So instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t like & won\u2019t use this\u201d or \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I wanted,\u201d why not just say \u201cthank you so much for the gift. It was very thoughtful of you.\u201d You can always return or donate it later. This way you look appreciative & the giver feels good instead of embarrassed. Win/win.\n\nI understand that the SIL in the story did say thank you though, so this doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to her. My second paragraph was more just surprise & response to all the answers where people complained of getting stuff they didn\u2019t want.", "That's why I resorted to giving only consumables, if you don't like them at least someone in the family may use it.\n\nPeople are so ungrateful with gifts and it's so hard to get a good gift for someone you don't see that frequently that it's a waste of money and time most of the time. Before I tried to give good quality things with in my budged to my family but knowing what my 40 year old male cousin likes, what my 25 year old female cousin likes, what my older than 70 aunt likes it's impossible and even if I had the best intentions I'm sure they probably won't like what I give them.\n\nThis year I gave them all high quality Belgian chocolate cookies and they all enjoyed them, so that will be my approach for now on.\n\nI still get some crap from time to time, re-given things  are the only gifts that piss me off but many times I get things that I don't like but I still show appreciation, because I know I'm hard to give and know but people do it with the best intention.", "He got her airpods", "Mostly just a theory since SIL left it out even after Op expressed her displeasure. \n\nI\u2019m not quick to put things away.

But even for things I do want, holiday laziness can slow things down!", "Yeah my family just left all our gifts in the living room on Christmas morning. When we got home from visiting family I just took the bags up to my room and left them there until I unpacked and put away everything. There really wasn't a connection between time and things I liked more or liked less. It's just a weird thing to obsess over. \n\nAnd at this point I have so much makeup I barely have room for it so that could also be the issue. At this point there is no place of more or less honor lol if it fits it sits. \n\nPlus what someone else said about maybe taking it back to school, I don't think most people pack things away deeply if they'll be used soon. \n\nAlso as someone in school myself I think we may be underestimating how much students can regress when we come back home \ud83d\ude02 especially with holiday laziness like you said. Like she may just be leaving it out to not deal with it right away regardless of how she feels about it."]}
