His parents are relatively well off and will spend significant amounts on gifts for each of the children ($500+). I know that may not be a large amount to some people here but I was always taught that it was the thought that matters. We're also not in high earning jobs so I thought that $500 was a little insane.\n\nThis year, I bought his sister a gift around $80(it was a well thought out package with items from sephora that I thought she might like) and the parents I choose to give a little more ($150 Ish each) as they're always gifting me nice things. A thing to note is that my SIL (F24) doesn't have a job and is still studying so she never gets me anything, not even a small gesture.\n\nHere's where the drama occurred. After opening her gift, SIL just smiled and said thanks. The next day after Christmas, I noticed the items I gave her lying on the common area in the dining room counter. I was a bit upset that she didn't put them away - when we all went to bed after that night. I casually asked if she forgot them on the counter and she replied flat, \"oh yeah maybe. I'll put it away later \". She didn't put it away and it's still there after 3 days. \n\nI feel like my gift wasn't appreciated and I asked my husband if I was being unreasonable. He said it's probably because I didn't get the gift she wanted in the first place (it was something like $250) and that since I gave her the gift, she can do whatever she wants with it. I said I will just not get her anything in the future because I don't feel like she deserves them if she can't appreciate the small things.

Not to mention that she has never bought you anything, so why would you continue to gift her? I would just say if anybody says anything, oh, she's never given me a gift, so I thought that she and I weren't exchanging gifts. But I'm Petty like that.", "NTA - although I agree with you, this isn't a situation where you'll win or even look good. I'd have told your husband that he can take $250 out of his personal budget and get her gifts from now on or she'll continue to get what you can afford. You are not required to please her.", "Honestly, ESH.\n\nShe is undoubtedly acting like an AH for being ungrateful. I feel like that goes without saying.\n\nBut you can't control how people react to your gifts. Even if you had bought something worth $250, it could have been the wrong shade, or wrong brand, or whatever, and she might have still reacted in the same bratty way.\n\nYou throwing a tantrum and showing her up NEXT Christmas by not getting her a gift will not make the situation better. It won't \"teach her a lesson\". If anything, it will make the mostly happy relationship you have with your hubby's side of the family significantly worse. Who are they going to side with? You? Nope.\n\nPick a budget to suit you, stick to it, and don't be ashamed of it. From the time you are done wrapping the gift, wash your hands of it. If they like it, amazing! If they don't, who cares. Don't cause a family drama over one bratty reaction. Be the better person.", "NTA. Woo, $500 on one person is insane to me as well. An $80 gift is more than enough, your husband\u2019s family seem to be materialistic. SIL is not appreciative & sounds very entitled. Seems she\u2019s sort of making a scene with the items as well by keeping them out in the common area. I wouldn\u2019t waste money on her again since she\u2019s been ungrateful but also she\u2019s never given a gift in return.", "NTA\n\nThe words you\u2019re looking for are ungrateful & entitled.", "NTA", "I'm somewhat unsure how to judge this one. Your SIL is being a bit of an AH by so blatantly disregarding your gift for her, and your husband seems somewhat callous to your feelings in your talk with him, but going directly from feeling your gift was underappreciated to \"I'm never going to get this person a gift ever again\" seems like a little much.\n\nLeaning slightly towards ESH here because of these conflicting factors, but when told from your specific viewpoint, I can see why you'd be upset, and I can also see why you might expect your husband to be someone to vent to, but you're venting to him about his family, and making some fairly final judgements over a single faux pas. I feel like you'd be N-T-A here if you hadn't jumped straight to \"since she doesn't appreciate my gift I'll never get her anything ever again.\"", "I am probably out of step with other posters but I'm going with YTA, though I did consider e s h. Your sister in law doesn't sound particularly charming, but taking offence that she didn't put away the gift and saying that she therefore doesn't deserve gifts in the future is, in my opinion, an overreaction.", "How can your husband support you better in this? Does he give her a gift as well, or the gifting responsibility lies solely on you?", "ESH. I think this could have been avoided had you just given her a Sephora gift card so she could get the items SHE wanted. \nBuying makeup or skincare/beauty stuff for someone else is really tricky. It's like buying someone a bra IMO.", "You said you thought she might like it, unfortunately it seems she doesn't.\n\nThat's just a part of gift giving in my opinion. She told you what she wanted and you rightfully didn't buy it, doesn't matter why not. Its your money and you chose not to buy it. That's it. However. She didn't want make up, she didn't ask for make up. Is it even in her shade? Colors she likes etc?? \n\nIn the end I think ESH, you more so than her. You can't force her to like something you bought when wasn't even on her list to begin with and while she did say thank you and didn't say anything negative, by her leaving it there shows she doesn't want it so she's a little bit of an ah for that", "YTA. You are very judgy toward his family and their traditions. Insane? Really? How mean. And even if you don't say your judgy opinions aloud, it likely comes across in your nonverbals. \n\nIt's unreasonable for you to expect them to give gifts that you would give, and also unreasonable for you to expect the SIL to handle the gifts a certain way. She said Thank you and that's all that's reasonable to expect. \n\nYour husband is right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Play the game, dude! Get her what you feel like getting her, budget IN mind and maybe less than $80 now, and if she reacts this way again make it a casual no problem deal. Shrug it off, and insist a gift receipt for the cash amount of the gift if she can find something she would prefer in the wrapping. This way you keep to your money boundaries, establish your boundaries with her in a less confrontational manner, and show that it wasn\u2019t out of malice. If she insists it as so, I would ask her why. See her fumble to find a good reason- a REAL reason she is upset you didn\u2019t spend more of you and her brothers money on her own wants and needs when you are trying to give gifts to your whole family for the holidays.", "She's the asshole? Really? For not giving a 250 dollar gift? What's the family tradition exactly? Demanding expensive gifts whilst giving nothing in return?"]}
