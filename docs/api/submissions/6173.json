I feel like that goes without saying.\n\nBut you can't control how people react to your gifts.

An $80 gift is more than enough, your husband\u2019s family seem to be materialistic. SIL is not appreciative & sounds very entitled.

She didn't want make up, she didn't ask for make up. Is it even in her shade? Colors she likes etc?? \n\nIn the end I think ESH, you more so than her.

Touch grass", "I don\u2019t understand how leaving a gift out on the counter is causing a scene.\n\n*edit, spelling", "Tantrum is totally overused! Often for someone just stating their boundaries reasonably.", "Ah, okay. That\u2019s a very generous and thoughtful gift. I understand why you felt it was unappreciated. I don\u2019t think your SIL was inherently in the wrong for leaving your gift out, but it would have been polite/kind of her to put it away once you said something. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a factor here, but for future reference, it\u2019s best not to buy makeup or makeup-related stuff for makeup lovers. I know it seems like the perfect gift, but makeup is extremely personal and specific. Unless you\u2019re close enough to know what your recipient has been lusting after or they request something specific, go with a gift card. And if you must buy a physical present, include a gift receipt.\n\nI think other commenter\u2019s suggestions to exchange gifts with each other\u2019s families as a couple is a really good one. Your husband can just give his gag gift in addition to that.", "This thread is wild", "Sometimes I purposely leave gifts out because I can\u2019t use it right away but someone got me something that I love and I like seeing it when I walk by. It reminds me of the thought and effort they put into a gift, and I can\u2019t use it immediately anyways.", "Regardless of assumed intent, a gift is usually unconditional. She said a polite thank you, and that's it, the cultural norm is fulfilled. \n\n  \nEven if it's annoying and can be read as a passive-aggressive statement, you do not dictate what the other person does with the gift - even if that means seeing it left laying around.   \nPeople who find issues out of unexpected and irrelevant places, meddle with others who do not meet their rigid expectations and then amplify those said negative emotions are tiresome to be around. OP could either re-examine the exact point where her 'shoulds' screw with her emotions, or accept that instead of being the \"gratitude checker\" and tainting the holiday memories, she could at least contain her outrage and not let it ruin the mood of those around her.", "Trying to buy gifts around someone's passion is such a minefield. For people who really insist on trying, I think usually the best approach is just figure out where they shop for their hobby related purchases and just get them a gift card.", "Apparently my MIL is an amazing cook. During our first Christmas I asked hubby if I should get her something with cooking. \"NO god no! She has triplicate of everything and anything you buy would be of such poor quality as to never get used. She does love light houses\"\n\nI bought her a lighthouse ornament for her tree and she leaves my little ornament up all year. \n\nLesson learned if I ever want to contribute to a hobby I have the person send me a link.", "Right? I feel I\u2019m missing something here because how is leaving things on a counter indicating anything? Our Christmas gifts are still all over our house even now.", "We don't know for sure if OP nailed a gift that SIL would genuinely like even though it wasn't on her list", "I mean, people leave Christmasgifts out all the tume, it\u2019s normal, unlike her complaining", "Honestly, I leave my gifts out for days, I have since I was a kid and I actually asked my spouse to next year please not put them away right away like he did this year and it\u2019s not because of disdain, it\u2019s actually completely opposite. I don\u2019t like to put it all away until I\u2019ve really had time to sit down and play with it or use it once or twice that way it doesn\u2019t get put away and forgotten about quickly. Makeup would take me a few days because holidays are busy and I prob wouldn\u2019t have time or need right then to use the skin care or play with eye shadow. I\u2019d wait till I had some quiet time to really \u201ctreat\u201d myself with it.", "I\u2019d be disappointed too. Next Christmas I\u2019d tell husband to buy the gift for his own damn sister and I\u2019d wash my hands of the whole mess.", "Agreed. I have a bunch of unwrapped presents sitting under my tree. These are lovely gifts that I was happy to receive. But also, I need to make the time and space for them in my home. I like and appreciate all of my gifts. \n\nI got a new electric toothbrush. I haven't put it in my bathroom yet. But I'm thrilled with the toothbrush. I want to take everything off my bathroom counter, decide what can be eliminated, clean the counter, then put back only what I really need.", "Really? Are you the SIL? it\u2019s rude. However it wouldn\u2019t be rude if all her other gifts were also laying about for the last 3 days. This is not mention. Op is your SIL a general slob. Is the gift in a place that makes it easier to use? Or is only your gift the one that stands out alone in a place that makes no sense. Please inquiring minds would like to know. Is this a habit of hers or is your gift especially ignored.", "I just found a roll of fancy tape I have been missing for 11 months because I put it in a drawer with clamps because they hold shit together and that was way too organized and thoughtful for me to remember. And I have been using one specific clamp and not putting it away this whole time because of course.", "I've found gifts in boxes a year later. (Stashed the boxes to reuse, forgot to remove gift first.)", "Which is still an assumption.", "I wonder what husband got her? In my family, I buy the  stuff for my relatives and my husband buys the stuff for his relatives. But the gifts are from both of us."]}
