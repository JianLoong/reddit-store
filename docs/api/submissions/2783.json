This happened a few months ago and I'm wondering what the verdict would be. I go to a very small liberal arts school, which is important later.\n\nThis girl in a few of my classes that I didn't know too well was there and was clearly drunk. She approached me by saying the stuff I said in class was smart, which I genuinely appreciated. So I chatted with her for a bit, and since it was a party with loud music, I was speaking leaning closer to her than I would in a normal conversation, because otherwise we wouldn't hear each other. She was being a bit creepy, taking advantage of this position to try to kiss my neck and generally being flirtatious when I signaled I wasn't interested. This was seemingly evident to other people too, since one guy came up to me and told me this girl's friend was outside and since it was clear she was making me uncomfortable I should let the friend know to get her some water and take her home. I tried doing just that, but the drunk girl kept insisting she didn't want to stop talking to me. She had also been asking for my number, so I agreed to give it to her as a compromise if she left. She said okay and we exchanged numbers. She ended up texting me a lot to ask me to come over, whether I had a girlfriend, and so on, but I ignored her, went to sleep, and thought that was the end of it.\n\nThe next day, a friend of mine told me that this girl had been saying I saw that she was drunk and tried to take advantage of her because of it. I was alarmed because I go to a small enough school that most people know each other at least a little and if this spread, it could quite literally turn the entire school against me. I showed my friend the texts she sent me, and he agreed it was pretty obvious she was trying to take advantage of me and not the vice versa. I wanted to show whoever this girl was telling her bs to these texts but had no idea who exactly she told-- she told my friend, and he didn't know who else she told. So I decided to just post these texts publicly-- another friend of mine runs an unofficial instagram account for the college so I got him to post some ss I sent him with a description of the situation.\n\nThis was risky since it revealed the situation to a lot of people who could've thought I was lying, but generally people saw the evidence for themselves and decided I was innocent. This same girl got extremely angry and texted me asking why I'd reveal private texts she sent, and threatened to go to the school with it, but nothing ever materialized, and recently she dropped out.

So your close buddy told you where he heard it? Did you confirm or just immediately go into freak out mode?\n\nYou should have gone to the school and made it clear that you were concerned that untrue rumors were being spread about you.

I don't see where what I said would have led you to think it was a different girl.", ">Believe it or not people can speak face to face, even these days\n\nWhich would be even worse, physically putting myself in a situation with somebody that's claiming the last time I did that I tried to take advantage of them. Putting myself physically in the same place as them gives them another chance to accuse me of having tried to take advantage.\n\n>You should have gone to the school and made it clear that you were concerned that untrue rumors were being spread about you\n\nAnd what would the school have done about public opinion? The school isn't going to go around telling random students I'm innocent, at best they'd take care of it quietly. And even then, going through the official channels takes time which I didn't have-- I had to provide the evidence before people heard the rumors and made up their minds.", "What's the alternative?", "Sounds like a lot of jumping to conclusions with no evidence. Sorry but a vague statement from a friend is not evidence. You don't have any specific information about anybody that she said anything to and then you spiraled out of control with anxiety and posted an embarrassing conversation. So now you posted evidence that she definitely has against you for the entire world to see.  This could be considered harassment. And now you say she withdrew from school? I would be very concerned about what is coming.", "I told her you weren\u2019t interested, you said she was being creepy but then you gave her your number", "Because you used the words \u201csomebody\u201d and \u201cher\u201d in a sentence in your first reply to me, which suggests two people\u2026", "Yes, of course you talking to her with other people around is going to wind up with a SWAT team.\n\nThe school has a duty to record incidents like this and if you were as smart as you think you are you would have already gotten ahead of it.\n\nBest of luck to you", ">Sorry but a vague statement from a friend is not evidence\n\nThere's nothing vague about 'x person is saying you tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk last night'.\n\n>I would be very concerned about what is coming.\n\nI'm not. There's evidence for her actions, which are far more serious than mine.", "To get her to go away", "That's not really how English works necessarily, but semantics aside it was the same girl. If a girl accuses me of trying to take advantage and then can also say 'he tried to text me later too' that just makes the situation look worse.", ">Yes, of course you talking to her with other people around is going to wind up with a SWAT team.\n\nThere are two ways to know where she is at any given time-- 1) walk around campus until I've found her 2) text her. 1 is creepy, 2 as I've already explained only paints me in a worse light, and neither guarantee she'd be willing to talk to me. So I could appear worse off in two separate ways for a sliver of a chance to confirm something a trusted friend had told me-- not very smart.\n\n>The school has a duty to record incidents like this and if you were as smart as you think you are you would have already gotten ahead of it.\r  \n\r\n\nThe school also takes weeks to set up appointments. I don't have that kind of time to wait while the rumor circulated", "Your actions humiliated her and drove her to drop out.\n\n Her actions made you upset. \n\nSo how are hers more serious?\n\nYou had multiple witnesses, text messages, and, according to you, you never even touched  her or was alone with her.  What sort of legal trouble do you expect?", "But she didn\u2019t accuse you. You just heard it second hand without any proof then decided to absolutely humiliate this poor girl without seeking any clarification. It could have been a rumour that started from someone else who saw you at the party. \n\nI get that it\u2019s stressful for you but you should have approached the school about it so they could mediate.", ">What sort of legal trouble do you expect?\n\nCourt of public opinion exists. As you say, I have evidence, but if she goes around telling people these rumors without my presenting my evidence, people are likely to believe her. And characterizing being seen as somebody taking advantage of a drunk girl as 'actions' that made me upset is ridiculous. If being embarrassed by a few texts is enough to drop out, imagine much greater the impact of accusations of attempting to take advantage of somebody, which is a far worse offense, would be.", "Approaching the school would mean booking an appointment, waiting, and so on. Rumors travel fast, and this is a serious accusation that would significantly have hurt me. This demanded a swift response before everybody heard this and made up their own mind with an incomplete picture. Sorry, but proving I didn't try to take an advantage of a drunk girl is vastly more important than preserving her the embarrassment of having drunk texts exposed. The two aren't even in the same ballpark of seriousness-- the former could get me in legal trouble or could make me a social pariah, the latter is slightly embarrassing for a few weeks.", "I\u2019d think a school would make time asap for an accusation like that\u2026 Plus you had texts to show them to clear your name. And you were at a public party, not in a private room\u2026 \n\nYou\u2019re still TAH, purely cos you acted without even confirming the information from your friend. She could have had no idea that rumour was circulating.", ">I\u2019d think a school would make time asap for an accusation like that\n\nThere's no way for them to *know* the accusation exists until they get back to me, which as I said would take booking an appointment. \n\n>You\u2019re still TAH, purely cos you acted without even confirming the information from your friend. She could have had no idea that rumour was circulating.\r  \n\r\n\nIt's a friend I've known for several years who has never given me a reason not to trust him.
