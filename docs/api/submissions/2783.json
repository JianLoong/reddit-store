This happened a few months ago and I'm wondering what the verdict would be. I go to a very small liberal arts school, which is important later.\n\nThis girl in a few of my classes that I didn't know too well was there and was clearly drunk. She approached me by saying the stuff I said in class was smart, which I genuinely appreciated. So I chatted with her for a bit, and since it was a party with loud music, I was speaking leaning closer to her than I would in a normal conversation, because otherwise we wouldn't hear each other. She was being a bit creepy, taking advantage of this position to try to kiss my neck and generally being flirtatious when I signaled I wasn't interested. This was seemingly evident to other people too, since one guy came up to me and told me this girl's friend was outside and since it was clear she was making me uncomfortable I should let the friend know to get her some water and take her home. I tried doing just that, but the drunk girl kept insisting she didn't want to stop talking to me. She had also been asking for my number, so I agreed to give it to her as a compromise if she left. She said okay and we exchanged numbers. She ended up texting me a lot to ask me to come over, whether I had a girlfriend, and so on, but I ignored her, went to sleep, and thought that was the end of it.\n\nThe next day, a friend of mine told me that this girl had been saying I saw that she was drunk and tried to take advantage of her because of it. I was alarmed because I go to a small enough school that most people know each other at least a little and if this spread, it could quite literally turn the entire school against me. I showed my friend the texts she sent me, and he agreed it was pretty obvious she was trying to take advantage of me and not the vice versa. I wanted to show whoever this girl was telling her bs to these texts but had no idea who exactly she told-- she told my friend, and he didn't know who else she told. So I decided to just post these texts publicly-- another friend of mine runs an unofficial instagram account for the college so I got him to post some ss I sent him with a description of the situation.\n\nThis was risky since it revealed the situation to a lot of people who could've thought I was lying, but generally people saw the evidence for themselves and decided I was innocent. This same girl got extremely angry and texted me asking why I'd reveal private texts she sent, and threatened to go to the school with it, but nothing ever materialized, and recently she dropped out.
