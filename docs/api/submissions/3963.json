{"id": 3963, "submission_id": "zcpm1t", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL that she needs to go home after she walked in on my husband and I?", "selftext": "My husband and I got married a little over a month ago. We dated for 3 years before that. He has always gotten along with my family and vice versa, with the exception of his mother who has made it pretty clear that she doesn\u2019t think that much of me.\n\nAbout a week ago, she told us that she was going to be in town and asked if she could stay at our place instead of a hotel. She originally told us that she was going to visit for two days, but after one day she decided that she wanted to stay for a week because she misses her son. I didn\u2019t really mind, until around the third day when I realized that she had pretty much glued herself to my husband.\n\nShe followed him everywhere from the time that he got home from work until she went to bed. If my husband and I were watching a movie in the living room, she would sit right next to us. If we were talking in a different room, she would find us and join the conversation. When he went to the store, she insisted on joining him. Even when I asked him for \u201chelp\u201d with fixing something in our room, she followed to give commentary. It was frustrating to not have any time alone with him. We also share a wall with the guest room, so we had to be considerate of the noise at night (even if we are just talking, the walls are pretty thin).\n\nSo, late last night she walked in on my husband and I having a moment in the kitchen (we were kissing and his hand was up my shirt). She started ranting about how we have been incredibly inconsiderate hosts, and she feels like she hasn\u2019t been able to spend any time with her son because she can\u2019t seem to get me off him. She also said something like \u201cI can\u2019t even get a glass of water in peace\u201d, My husband apologized to her and said that we thought she had gone to sleep, and we thought we weren\u2019t making that much noise. She started to lecture him about respect, which led to me telling her that if she is so upset that she needs to go home.\n\nAs soon as she realized that my husband was not going to stand up for her, she left the room and slammed the door behind her. She left this morning and sent my husband and I a lengthy text message about how I had no right to talk to her with such disrespect. She said that my true colors are starting to show and that I am a sneaky, low-class woman with no family values. She expects an apology from both of us, especially me because I had no right to speak to her with such disrespect when we were in the wrong.\n\nMy husband responded to her saying that we aren\u2019t going to apologize and that she isn\u2019t welcome to stay with us anymore, and I wholeheartedly agree. I\u2019m not going to make excuses for making out in the kitchen, but I feel like she had been obnoxious while she was with us and then blew the situation way out of proportion\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1670196678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcpm1t/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_she_needs_to_go_home/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were more than considerate allowing her to stay an extra week without prior agreement.  Second, who invades their newlywed son's home for a week?!\n\n>She started to lecture him about respect\n\nShe knows nothing of respect.  See above.\n\nYou did good.  You knocked her off her petal stool and made it clear who rules your home.  If you didn't do it now, she'd think she can get away with this in the future.\n\nDemand a hotel for any future visits.

It\u2019s your home and you\u2019re newlyweds, you and your husband are perfectly fine making out. Don\u2019t feel guilty about being intimate *in your own home.*\n\nHis mom acted very entitled and wasn\u2019t a good guest. She wanted to monopolize his time and essentially keep you two apart. I hope you both stick to your guns and don\u2019t allow her to stay over for any extended period of time, because it\u2019ll just be a repeat otherwise.", "So she invited herself and extended her stay with a newlywed couple. And then got angry when they behaved like newlyweds. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s your home and you have been VERY respectful of her. She extended her stay without even asking if it was okay, she just decided on her own. Also, you guys weren\u2019t doing anything in front of her until she walked in. It\u2019s your home. You should feel comfortable without the fear of her walking in on you or hurting her feelings. \n\nI\u2019m glad your husband has your back and is in the same page as you. He sounds like a true keeper!", "NTA. Family are like fish - both should be removed after three days. First of all, she never asked if she could extend her visit, she told you she was. And then she gave two newlyweds absolutely no privacy. It's pretty obvious that she is trying to get in between the two of you.\n\nI am heartened to see that your husband did not knuckle down to his mother and that he stood up for you. Looks like she tried to force a confrontation where your husband would be forced to choose between the two of you and lost.", "NTA- mommy\u2019s got issues", "NTA\n\nYou are newlyweds! What did she expect??\n\nThere is no need to apologize and her insulting you and demanding one is completely out of order.\n\nIt sounds like she was hoping for a little one on one time with her son during her visit. Future visits may be more tolerable even if she doesn\u2019t stay with you if you encourage a lunch or outing or two just the two of them. My MIL always told me that time alone with her son was one of the best gifts I ever gave her and how much she appreciated that. Just a thought.", "NTA. You two are still in honeymoon stage. It was  rude of her to stay that long and infringe on YOUR privacy. If she expected privacy, she needed to stay at a hotel or better yet, her own home.\n\nFrom her comment it sounds like she is struggling with her son having a wife, and feeling a bit salty she doesn't have him to herself.\n\nKeep your healthy boundaries. I hope she adjusts over time.", "NTA. If it's so disruptive to her peace to find you two kissing with a hand up a shirt, maybe she shouldn't have invited herself to an extended stay in your house (especially as newlyweds!).", "NTA it sound like your monster in law has a classic case of \"no one is good enough for my baby boy\". It's her issues not yours and not your husband's. \n\nIt's good to see both of you working as a team because that kind of disrespect in your own home is unexcuseable. Sounds like she would have found something to complain about. \n\nAlso who is going to complain about seeing their child in a loving affectionate relationship with his new wife?", "NTA.  It's unfortunate that MIL isn't able to act according to accepted social behaviors.   You and husband did your best to accommodate her eccentricities and it just didn't work out.  MIL is the asshole.", "NTA \n\nYour husband apologized to his mother because she had walked in on you guys being slightly intimate in a common area ( even though it\u2019s your house).\n\nOn her part, she should have accepted his apology gracefully.\n\nShe spent her entire stay being glued to her son and that\u2019s way beyond normal. Good for you guys to lay out boundaries with her. It\u2019s sad because this type of behavior from a MIL doesn\u2019t seem to go away and you are looking at years of fraught relationship even with minimal contact", "Nta. Even if you weren't newlyweds you are grown adults in your own home. Heck if my MIL had ever walked into the kitchen  after we thought she was sleeping she would have seen more than a hand up my shirt. \ud83d\ude06", "Your MIL is TA for sure. Kudos to your hubby for standing by you as well. NTA.", "NTA time for boundaries.  Not easy but you have to.  Been there.", "NTA and congratulations on your husband having your back so thoroughly.  What your MIL was doing was flat creepy and she obviously has absolutely no idea of how to be a polite guest.

Congratulations on your new AH MIL.", "NTA - your home, your rules\u2026 She invited herself over and overstayed her welcome", "NTA. Good on husband.", "NTA, never in a million years. So much of her behaviour is wrong but hey she got thrown out so sucks to be her. You're well rid of her and don't concern yourself with her ranting, with any luck she'll burst her boiler. If she evrr brings this up I'd be tempted to ask her if she was annoyed because you didn't ask her to join in.", "NTA", "NTA. Who stays for a week with newlyweds? There were so many humorous, or at least less ridiculous, ways she could have handled it when she walked in on you, but she chose violence.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA she should have never even asked to stay knowing you are newly weds.", "NTA she was over stepping big time and it\u2019s for the best she doesn\u2019t stay over after tht doesn\u2019t mean u can\u2019t have a relationship with her just have a set of boundaries with her tht she cnt break and atleast u won\u2019t have to force her out ur house again", "NTA\n\nSo glad to see someone post on this subreddit who has a husband that stands up for them against his mother; congratulations for finding a good one!", "It's been a while since I last saw a post where the partner was actually a decent person. NTA and awesome job from the both of you.", "NTA. Next time tell her to get a hotel or don\u2019t come at all. The audacity of her telling you that you\u2019re disrespectful. Wow.", "Info: since the whole point of her visit was to get to spend time with her son, was he actually making time for her in the few hours she got to see him between him coming home from work and bed? It seems weird that you\u2019re annoyed that on day 2 she wanted to join you for a movie. Is she supposed to stay in her room out of sight? \n\nI\u2019m typically alway going to favor the DIL in these situations but this seems a little fishy and like maybe you wanted him to not give her any time or attention during her visit.", "I am going to go against the tide her and say ESH. While you are entitled to a certain level of privacy in your own home, if you have a guest it isn't cool to get busy in a room where they could easily walk in.\n\nThat being said MIL sounds lousy and is in no position to demand that you apologize for acting like newlyweds after she invited herself into your home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
