{"id": 3963, "submission_id": "zcpm1t", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL that she needs to go home after she walked in on my husband and I?", "selftext": "My husband and I got married a little over a month ago. We dated for 3 years before that. He has always gotten along with my family and vice versa, with the exception of his mother who has made it pretty clear that she doesn\u2019t think that much of me.\n\nAbout a week ago, she told us that she was going to be in town and asked if she could stay at our place instead of a hotel. She originally told us that she was going to visit for two days, but after one day she decided that she wanted to stay for a week because she misses her son. I didn\u2019t really mind, until around the third day when I realized that she had pretty much glued herself to my husband.\n\nShe followed him everywhere from the time that he got home from work until she went to bed. If my husband and I were watching a movie in the living room, she would sit right next to us. If we were talking in a different room, she would find us and join the conversation. When he went to the store, she insisted on joining him. Even when I asked him for \u201chelp\u201d with fixing something in our room, she followed to give commentary. It was frustrating to not have any time alone with him. We also share a wall with the guest room, so we had to be considerate of the noise at night (even if we are just talking, the walls are pretty thin).\n\nSo, late last night she walked in on my husband and I having a moment in the kitchen (we were kissing and his hand was up my shirt). She started ranting about how we have been incredibly inconsiderate hosts, and she feels like she hasn\u2019t been able to spend any time with her son because she can\u2019t seem to get me off him. She also said something like \u201cI can\u2019t even get a glass of water in peace\u201d, My husband apologized to her and said that we thought she had gone to sleep, and we thought we weren\u2019t making that much noise. She started to lecture him about respect, which led to me telling her that if she is so upset that she needs to go home.\n\nAs soon as she realized that my husband was not going to stand up for her, she left the room and slammed the door behind her. She left this morning and sent my husband and I a lengthy text message about how I had no right to talk to her with such disrespect. She said that my true colors are starting to show and that I am a sneaky, low-class woman with no family values. She expects an apology from both of us, especially me because I had no right to speak to her with such disrespect when we were in the wrong.\n\nMy husband responded to her saying that we aren\u2019t going to apologize and that she isn\u2019t welcome to stay with us anymore, and I wholeheartedly agree. I\u2019m not going to make excuses for making out in the kitchen, but I feel like she had been obnoxious while she was with us and then blew the situation way out of proportion\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1670196678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcpm1t/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_she_needs_to_go_home/", "score": 704, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you choose to intrude on newlyweds who haven't had a chance to establish themselves as a new nuclear unit, you were asking for this. She went from two days to a week? A month after her son got married? Hard no. That was the only AH move here. And it's not public areas of a house. It's their home fullstop. She was basically an intruder at this point. My MIL thinks it's cute when her kids kiss their spouses. She is a big proponent of physical touch being important in a healthy marriage. Is keep feeling she should teach classes on that to other parents of adult offspring.", "i mean... maybe you'd have a point if OP didn't state they both thought MIL was already asleep. i don't think there's anything wrong with kissing your husband in the kitchen when you think your house guest is asleep, especially if you've had to wait until your house guest is assumed asleep before you even get alone time together.\n\nyes, maybe bedroom would have been a better choice. but maybe not since OP already said their bedroom wall shares a wall with the guest room & so they've been trying to be considerate when in their room because they know MIL may hear them... seems like they were left with little space to be alone as newlyweds.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/harleybidness \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcpm1t/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_she_needs_to_go_home/iyxrove/\n\nBot Reported.", "Out of curiosity, how did she behave at the wedding? And of course, NTA", "Me? I didn't comment on this post. What are you talking about?", "And firstable", "Caught that afterward, but honestly, not sure it matters.", "Then they should have put their foot down and said sorry, but no, you can\u2019t stay here we want our intimacy.\n\nSee, I\u2019m not even super sensitive; I would not particularly have cared walking in on them accidentally, neither would I have been as upset as OP was that someone is accidentally walking in. But OP can\u2019t have it *both* ways: she can\u2019t make out at a public place in the home *and* get upset that the third person does not know and ends up walking in.\n\nThis sub is super inconsistent in that regard. When a few days ago someone posted about their roommate making out on the couch in the living room or something like, that roommate was immediately labeled AH for the reason of public space Blabla. In this case somehow OP is not the AH, just because they are newly married - makes no sense (especially because they have already been together for three years too; it\u2019s not like that\u2019s a brand new relationship).", "I think this newlyweds things is blown a bit too much out of proportion on here tbh (like everything surrounding weddings in this sub).\n\nThey have been a couple for three years; other than their both signatures on a piece of paper and them having the same last name now, there was nothing soooo drastically different now about their relationship that they just could not stop themselves from making out 24/7 - I would have even more understanding for that, had it been an actually new *relationship* as opposed to newlyweds who have been together before for so long.\n\nAnd again: the walking in is not the primary issue; OP getting upset about the walking in that was totally likely is what makes it ESH.", "[\u2013]Mother-Sound-1390\n \n[-1] -4 points an hour ago \nESH, IMO. Both of you are vying for the same man. Your husband, her son. Sounds like he didn't make much time for one-on-one with his mom.\n\nWhat are you talking about? This is a reply to your comment on this post.", "A public space with roommates is different from overstaying your welcome with a newly married couple. All living spaces and living arrangements are not equal. If I'm a nudist, and you aren't comfortable with that, you stay in a hotel. Not my home. If I just got married, I'm in the canoodling phase. Not the time for an extended visit. Different from 3 or 4 people renting somewhere. Yes they should have told her to leave, bit I can imagine she was already guilting her son.", "The issue isn't the MIL just having walked in on them, what seems to have set OP off is the MIL ranting at them. She could have gotten her water and gone back to bed without being rude.\n\nOP is NTA", "i don't think the length of relationship prior to marriage matters that much. some couples do get all giddy & excited after marriage, stuff like changing someone's last name or merging bank accounts or any other seemingly mundane thing can be exciting when what you're doing is fresh & new to you (absolutely may not be exciting for others).\n\n& i don't think it's a bad thing to revel in that giddy bliss for a month or more. i could be totally wrong & op & her husband have always been very affectionate & snogging all over the shop when at home, who knows, but if that's the case i'd assume MIL would have walked in on them in similar situations in the past so wouldn't have been so shocked about it happening again. \n\nfor me OP isn't the AH for getting upset, solely because MIL started ranting first; OP simply responded. MIL over-staying her welcome & not letting them get any alone time as a couple prior to this is almost secondary, but does make why OP snapped when goaded even more understandable. saying something like \"i can't even get a glass of water in peace\" when you are a guest in someone else's house is rude & aggressive, especially when you're staying longer than you said."]}
