He has a great sleep routine. Our \"wind down\" time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours.\n\nIt's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says \"Dada\". Then I leave the app, call my wife to wake her up.\n\nI usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day.\n\nThis morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with \"well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called\".\n\nI just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play.\n\nAm I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers.

I don't get these YTA posts, if he didn't call to wake her up every morning how long would the kid be in the crib? I'm a mom as well and have been through this phase, if the child sleeps for 12 hrs which is really about the max they will sleep at that age, then he is getting up at about 8 am. Yes, it's good and fine for him to have alone time and quiet time, but leaving him alone until 10 am (2 hrs) is absolutely not acceptable. 1 hour  alone in the morning is also too much IMO. We let our 2 year old have alone time in the morning while we get adjusted, but it's about 10-15 minutes max.

Is there a safe place for your kid to play with minimal supervision while your spouse is making breakfast? I would shift focus into seeing if there is a problem there and helping to solve it, or insist that you guys get a morning nanny or something. 2 hours is a really really long time for solo mornings and I agree with others that the kid might accept this bc it\u2019s his norm now but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ideal.\nOh, another info - is his diaper area skin healthy?

He\u2019s needs a diaper change, and probably hungry!\nI understand an hour, letting your wife wake up, shower makes coffee get herself ready and then get the baby! But more than 2 hours and she\u2019s still dead asleep, having to call her 3 times before she answers. Your son is getting older, and that\u2019s when babies start climbing out of the crib. Maybe you need to sit with your wife and figure out what\u2019s going on, if she in fact does have her routine with the baby and these are just off days you seen her in.\n\nEdit: Op has stated in the comments that his wife has chronic fatigue, but she doesn\u2019t take her b12 shots because she forgets. Baby sleeps thru the night, mom is able to sleep thru the night, her waking up late is her choice. She\u2019s a mother now, her baby relies on her to eat! Him not crying isn\u2019t even the point, he\u2019s at the age will he will start getting curious, getting out the crib and exploring. Her establishing a routine with her son would work better for her, she can nap when he naps. If she\u2019s not able to force herself to get up, She and Op need to sit down and discuss getting help. Again him entertaining himself is not the issue, the issue is being awake for hours before mom acknowledges him. Accidents happen even when your watching, but being left unsupervised the risk is bigger. All these YTA comments are only looking out for the wife, what about the baby?! Would you still say YTA if it was the dad sleeping in, we\u2019re always so quick to judge the fathers but not the mothers.\n\n\nThank you guys for the awards\u263a\ufe0f", "Info: is she up with him during the night while you are sleep?", "YTA.

Your wife should have a schedule, babies need it and she shouldn't be relying on you to wake her up. However, I don't think you're going about this in the most productive way. You and your wife clearly don't agree on this and you need to make a parenting plan and daily schedule you're both happy with. Crucially, you need to be willing to swap roles if that would work better for your son.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, let's start with the fact that your kid is now into toddler range as opposed to infant.  Your kid can manage a few moments alone in their crib and will still cry if they need any worthwhile attention.\n\nSecondly, let's say she took the toddler with her while preparing the food. Your kid is now in learning escape methods, getting into crap, cause mischief stage.

I have 5 kids so I get it but this isn\u2019t ok.", "YTA\n\nYour intentions may be good, but your actions are bordering on sinister.\n\nIf you want this level of control over what happens in the morning, be there to do it yourself. \n\nIf you are not willing or able to be there to do it yourself, find a solution that isn't remotely monitoring your wife. Whether that's hire a nanny, change your work shifts, whatever.\n\nYour post sounds like the start of a psychological horror film.\n\n**Edit:** If you read that and are about to reply that I am endorsing child neglect... No I didn't. I said what he is doing is creepy and suggested two alternatives of changing his hours to be there himself, or hiring help. I wouldn't suggest alternatives if I thought it was all fine as is. Don't attack people for things they didn't say.\n\nAlso, if you are now about to say anything along the lines of \"maybe he can't afford to do either of those\", here is OPs response, emphasis in bold is mine.\n\n> Do you honestly believe that it's acceptable to go to bed at 9:00 and sleep until 12:00 even though you have a toddler at home that wakes up at 8:00? **I shouldn't have to be there nor should I have to spend money on someone to care for my child when his mother is perfectly capable.**\n\nSo its not the money, its the principle. OP doesn't care as much about his son's welfare as he does the principle that his wife should be fine by herself. Except she clearly isn't. But OP is going to change nothing and keep up his Big Brother act instead.\n\nAnd presumably OP is also going to keep ignoring everyone asking how he knows the toddler wakes up at 8am if he doesn't check the camera until 9am, or why he keeps changing how long his wife sleeps in the comments.\n\n**Edit 2:** Oh and apparently OP has said elsewhere that his wife has narcolepsy.", "I have 2 kids and my husband did exactly this minus the monitor checking as we didn't have one that nice. He knew when baby would wake up and hed call to make sure I had got up when the kid did or if the baby woke up before he went to work he'd make sure I was up before he left. Our kids are 10 and 3 now and he still does that. I can't personally handle leaving my awake baby in the crib alone in the dark for any longer than it would take for me to run to the bathroom, a few hours is crazy imo. I like that my husband let's me sleep but also makes sure I get up. Maybe your wife is overwhelmed tho and it feels like more than a nice gesture to her. Maybe she feels judged or that you're saying shes incapable of doing it on her own. I do know that narcolepsy meds make it difficult to wake up so I can see your call being needed especially if it takes multiple tries to get her, I'd worry about sleeping thru the baby crying because my husband has when he was taking those meds. I can see both sides on this so I don't want to make a vote on the judgement but I don't exactly think either parent is wrong here. I am sorry it's a thing tho and hopefully it's only temporary. Give her a big hug next time you see her. Take the baby when you get home and let her get some extra sleep even. Good luck to you both regardless", "NTA, but I can see how it would be annoying.

The baby needs a diaper change most likely, needs to be fed, and shouldn\u2019t be left unattended for an hour anyways.

But neither of us are sleeping while a child or children are awake! Babies absolutely do learn not to cry if nobody comes for them. They need fed regularly to avoid hunger and they need changed regularly to avoid nappy rash and infections. \n\n\nThe question is, why is the wife sleeping in so late every day? Why is she not up with the child? Is she not sleeping through the night? Is she up watching TV or on the internet and so too tired to get up? Is she depressed? Is she struggling? Why is she leaving the baby all alone while she does the breakfast? Most mums have the baby in the same room as them, talking to them and interacting with them. This is an important part of a child\u2019s development.\n\n\nI feel the mum might be struggling or needing more time to herself. I feel something isn\u2019t quite right. Rather than accusing, OP needs to gently get to the bottom of this, as I feel this isn\u2019t really normal or ok long term. \n\n\nNTA, but that\u2019s not to say your wife is.

Your son shouldn't have to cry for attention or be pushed to a point where he's miserable enough to cry and wake her up. That's going to be a really hard habit to break. Leaving him for two hours alone, awake, wet, and getting hungry when they need fed so often? PPD lasts a while, maybe ask your wife how she's feeling and if she needs any help? Consider daycare for half days maybe? That is your child too and you're allowed to be concerned for his health and wellbeing. Pointing out your concerns is not an insult to your wife's parenting skills", "NTA. I'm a bit horrified by the people saying that you are. If the toddler is sleeping through the night, that means everyone is or should be sleeping through the night. There's no reason for her not to wake up at a reasonable time and make sure that he's changed so he's not sitting in his pee and poop. And how is she going to fix his breakfast first and then change him, which means breakfast could be cold by the time she gets done. I would hate to be micromanaged too, but there's a reason she needs to be micromanaged right now.", "NTA. It blows my mind that she sleeps that late and long after your kid wakes up. And then to refuse to go in there until breakfast is ready is so odd. I always want to see my little ones when they get up, especially when they were babies. I lived for those morning snuggles. Maybe she is feeling burnt out and needs a day to herself and someone can watch your son? Her behavior is off to me and I probably would have reacted the same as you.", "NTA.

It\u2019s one thing to let them hang for a bit, but your wife is a grown woman, what is she doing sleeping until 10am?? This is borderline neglect. You are doing the right thing and I would suggest pursuing therapy if she thinks leaving a child in his crib for 2 hours after he wakes up is acceptable.", "NTA. Your wife has issues guy. She doesn't work and sleeps in until 9 or 10am and then leaves the child with a wet diaper and an empty belly while she farts around making her own breakfast? \nI can understand that she doesn't want to be micromanaged. However, her behavior says she needs to be 'managed' in order for her to provide the child with basic needs. \nYou need to get off reddit and talk to your spouse.", "NTA \n\nYour wife needs to step up and take care of your child or she might have PPD.

He has a great sleep routine.\", \n\n\"when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and **sleeps all night for at least twelve hours**.\"\n\n\"It's usually **after 9:00 before I have a chance to check** the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and **some mornings are closer to 10:00**. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting.\"\n\n\"I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. **He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play.**\"\n\nSo we have basically an almost 2 year old here who isn't potty trained yet. Googling around shows that on an average day a toddler above the 12 month range will usually go through about 7 diapers a day which is about *1 every 3.5ish hours.* \n\nGoogling around also shows that when a child is between 2-3 years old the longest they should be left alone while awake, even for solo play, is around *30 minutes*. \n\nGoogling ALSO says that kids in the 2-3 year range should be eating roughly *5-6 times a day (3 meals, 2-3 snacks) about every 2-3 hours while awake.* That's not counting drinking which should be much more frequent.\n\nSo we are looking at a child who is unable to take care of themselves ***being awake and left alone in the dark*** for at least an hour usually, sometimes even up to two hours.\n\nIt is neglect. Yes, the wife should probably see someone about potential ppd or depression, and yeah the OP is probably annoying the shit out of her every day waking her up.

I don't wait more than 3 hours to change him and my son has a very structured routine. Im sorry but most people here don't know what is like. I get it's annoying and you're 'micromanaging' but for babies time runs different and sadly you need to sacrifice sleep hours for them. We're the adults but they deserve to be attended since they wakeup. Mine is 8mo and sleeps with me coz he hates the crib. but he sleeps on his own and respect his hours. I'd feel like an asshole if i had him waiting for more than an hour for me to check up on him. Just my opinion as a mom.", "So your toddler spends 14 hrs a day in his crib, at least two of those hours awake and with a wet/dirty diaper? Nothing to eat or drink?

How much is he not seeing?\n\nAs a stay-at-home mother, it is OP's wife's *literal job* to care for her child and she is a major AH for not taking that job as seriously as she should. A good parent doesn't need to be nudged or reminded by the other to give their child basic needs: food, diaper changes, and attention. The fact that she doesn't even have an alarm set and dad needs to call 4-5 times just to wake her up is disturbing and demonstrates that even if the baby was crying she wouldn't get up.\n\nThank God that this little boy has at least one parent who is prioritizing his needs and thinking about him even while he is away at work.\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA.

Your child can play with toys while your wife makes breakfast or they can be a part of the routine. Your micro management isn't a helpful approach but I agree with you that he shouldn't be waiting for hours either. Does she get to go to any Mommy and me classes or swimming or something?

Stare into a dark void of a wall to learn creative thought? I get why he's just standing there bored at least, because leaving toys within reach can be an issue too. What if he chokes on something while the wife is asleep? A choking baby can't cry for help if that's the only form of alarm clock going on. He literally has no option, but to sit there and wait for hours. If the kid is up and alert, he should have the lights on and some form of stimulation to get his creative thoughts flowing.

But this is a completely different situation. \n\nYour wife GETS UP when that child cries even with all of her health issues.

I'd say it be best for her to possibly take a part-time role that she can manage with her conditions, then use that extra money to pay for childcare.

If you dislike a person as much as it seems you do her then you need to cut your losses. You will both be happier in the long run.\n\nThe obvious distain you hold for your wife and the fact that you continued to assume facts not in evidence makes me question the validity of your story. First you assume that your baby wakes up at 8:00. You admitted yourself that you don\u2019t have time to check the camera until 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning. You don\u2019t know what time he wakes up. You just know he\u2019s awake when you check on him. I personally think that if you were really that concerned about this issue you would be checking the camera at 8:00 and calling your wife at 8:00, which while a rude and disrespectful move on your part, would prevent the baby from what you claim is an unhealthy situation.\n\nYou\u2019re also assuming the baby goes to sleep at 8:00. You said yourself that you put him down and leave him in there. Unless your checking on him every five minutes there\u2019s a good possibility he\u2019s not going to sleep right away. If your story is true then it could be a much longer while since he\u2019s used to spending time awake in his crib. All of this calls into question the time frame you\u2019ve presented. On that note I\u2019m curious what the routine is on the days you are off work. If you go in and wake him up at 8:00 then that would explain why you assume he wakes up that early on his own.\n\nI\u2019m also curious how many times you saw him on the camera like that before you started talking to him. If it was the first or second time then you don\u2019t have enough evidence to suggest that what you saw originally is or was the norm. By now he\u2019s been conditioned to wait for your voice even if it means his needs aren\u2019t being met. If mom comes and gets him he won\u2019t get to talk to dada. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s also figured out that when he hears Dada that mom will come get him soon.\n\nYou said your wife wakes up if he cries. The baby is 20 months old and you\u2019re just now upset about her morning routine? Her routine is bad now because you over stepped her boundaries and then stomped all over them.\n\nShe sleeps, the baby sleeps, the baby wakes up and cries, the mom wakes up and takes care of him. This is a normal morning routine. Now that doesn\u2019t work because he wants to hear dada\u2019s voice talking to him. Which btw the idea of a disembodied voice talking to a child is creepy af. (Tbh the fact that\u2019s even possible is absolutely terrifying. What if some weirdo hacked your system and started talking to your kid? Yikes but I digress)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s your response when she shared her feeling about your actions. \u201cyour routine sucks!\u201d Seriously how old are you?\n\nAnother major assumption is what time your wife wakes up. \u201cI call her three or four times before she answers.\u201d If she can wake up to the baby crying in the other room she can hear your call the first time. I\u2019m guessing she just doesn\u2019t want to listen to your constant abusive rhetoric. You don\u2019t know if she just woke up or not because you aren\u2019t there. You are at work where you are supposed to be working not treating your wife like she\u2019s the same age as your son.\n\nYou said that your wife has been diagnosed with chronic fatigue. Yet you callously disregard her health because it\u2019s inconvenient for you. Everyone is saying ppd which is a very real possibility, but I\u2019d wager that the root of the issue stems from the way you treat her. Telling her she\u2019s not a good mom, that what she does sucks, that she never does anything around the house, I mean listen to yourself. I have no doubt you\u2019ve called her a \u201clazy wife\u201d to her face or you wouldn\u2019t have written it that way in the comments.\n\nI wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt until I read your comments. You\u2019re both the AH. You for being a boundary stomping, overly controlling, name calling husband and her for agreeing to have a baby with you instead of filing for divorce and taking care of her own mental health first before trying to take on motherhood then allowing her baby to share in suffering the consequences of that choice.\n\nAll that being said I have two suggestions for handling this situation. First you both need counseling asap together and separately. Second if on the off chance you were being honest and sincere about your concern for your son instead of just trash talking your wife to strangers on the internet then I would suggest looking into day care even if it\u2019s just half day in the morning. She can wake up and drop him off then go home and get the rest she obviously needs. Or better yet you could drop him off on your way to work. This will also give her time to do things around the house since she supposedly \u201cnever does anything.\u201d\n\nThis is a prime example of the saying \u201cTo assume things will make an ass out of u and me too.\u201d ESH", "All of these YTA comments would 100% be calling the dad a lazy bum if he was the one staying at home sleeping in while the toddler sat awake for an hour+ every morning.

Your wife should do a little better and you should have a little more faith that she\u2019s doing her best.

She needs additional help, the baby should not have to suffer and if her medical condition makes it so her child is neglected for hours at a time then he should be placed in daycare or have a babysitter in the mornings.

ESPECIALLY when they're a toddler.\n\nDo you have any family or friends who might be able to watch your child to give your wife a break more regularly? Is hiring a nanny or using a childcare service an option? And, if your wife can get some free time, can she see a therapist? Also, how many depression medicines did she try before deciding they didn't work? Because there are serveral different types, and it's not at all uncommon to have to try multiple before finding one that helps. Some people give up way too soon.\n\nI'm gonna say NAH.

I\u2019m a mother myself and a child that young absolutely needs to eat/drink and get a diaper change within an hour of waking up. Children need to eat more often than adults, especially toddlers and babies. The very first thing you should do with a baby/toddler in the morning when it wakes up is give it a hug, a diaper change, some milk or water, and THEN you can go on about making breakfast. I mean for Christ sake, every person I know in the world wants to at least have a glass of water when they wake up. And when is the last time you\u2019ve gone a whole 14 hours without eating??

It\u2019s certainly not enough sleep for a person doing 100% of child rearing for 13.5 hours a day, several days a week.

It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a cure or even an official treatment for her condition, it\u2019s mostly just throwing drugs at the problem and hoping something works. The amount of ableist people in this thread saying she\u2019s a bad mother because she doesn\u2019t just get over her medical issues have no freaking clue how debilitating living with a chronic condition can be.

The only people who would know how your child reacts to these things is you and your wife but I personally feel like your son shouldn\u2019t have to sit in his dirty sleep diaper for 1-2 hours after wake up time. If she has stuff to do then she could change him and put him back in the crib, allowing him some alone time to play by himself.

Still, it doesn\u2019t really matter if she is sick or depressed, if you are conditioning the baby to expect to be neglected, you are both complicit.

I know this because I am an extremely light sleeper and would almost always be awake before him. I also knew what he was doing because I have kids in the era of video monitors that record sound and movement and which also allowed me to sit and watch him do those things in real time (which I did often because it was adorable and hilarious). If it had been audio only, I wouldn\u2019t have suspected a thing until he actually made a noise. He\u2019s in kindergarten now and still very private about learning and practicing new things. \n\nMy daughter, on the other hand, is completely different.

Whatever the reason is, whether it\u2019s due to a sleep disorder, depression, some other illness or just a failure to mobilise affect with respect to her child, no matter what the reason is, the important thing is that your baby is not being cared for in the way he deserves and needs. Your child is being neglected. You need to remedy that right away and clearly cameras and phone calls and telling your wife she has to parent is not going to work.

It is a big deal and she as well as you should recognise that something needs to be done about it.\n\nIf you feel your wife is making no genuine effort to resolve her health issues across time then you will have to look at separating as the situation will ultimately become untenable.

I have two small kids so speaking from experience here. If you know for sure the baby is waking up around eight and it\u2019s left in there for an hour or more that\u2019s not cool. Again I ask if it was a man at home leaving a baby in a crib for an hour or longer while he slept and the woman was working long hours/days and having to call and wake the father up, I don\u2019t think your answers would be the same.\n\nEdited: I do think the wife needs some sort of medical help though. Just saying. And to everyone saying it\u2019s creepy that he checks the cam, I do it often as well when my kids are home with their father just to see how they are doing without bothering anyone.

They likely rounded up to 2 and then picture an almost 3 year old in ability and self sufficiency level.\n\nCPS or equivalent would likely court order intervention if they were aware a child this age was regularly left unattended for 2 hours while awake", "If she has chronic fatigue then that's something that needs real help to address and isn't really something you can just 'attitude' your way out of. And I think you're maybe missing that many people are saying YTA because, regardless of whether what she's doing is ok, OP's hounding was a poor way to address anything and was an asshole thing to do.\n\nAlso yeah if roles were reversed I'd say the same thing. Being 'checked up on' and scolded daily isn't going to brighten anybody's day, especially when OP KNOWS she struggles with chronic fatigue!\n\nLike, I have a family member with Crohn's. And it would be pretty assholy of me to complain to them about how much time they spend in the bathroom and how their restrictive diet is making meals boring, day in and out. OP is justified to have concerns but he should have *talked to her about it* instead of nagging", "Very well said, so many are so focussed on how long the child stands there ( like an NPC for hours??) And not focussing on the actual issue with OP's controlling behaviour. Either way it's  a YTA because of how he's gone about it.", "OP has said that once the baby starts crying mom does come get him. He isn't being taught that crying will get him nowhere.", "This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "Apparently she has narcolepsy.", "We saying yta because he omitted the fact that she's narcoleptic in his original post. She needs help because the meds she's on aren't working enough. So instead of micromanagement he van either be home more or hire a nanny. We haven't a clue how we'll she can manage but op knew her medical history before making a baby.", "OP stated in a comment \n\n> Depression medicine didn't work, blood tests were \"good except low b-12\", she \"forgets\" to take the b-12, now she takes medicine that normally treats ADHD/narcolepsy and has chronic fatigue. \n\nSo yeah he's an \ud83c\udf51", "Also dad probably Pavlovian responded him to the light so now dad is forcing kid to expect mom when the light is on and forcing mom by harassing her during her only moments to herself", "They both should've planned better. Parents are sleep deprived as it is without the added medical issues.", "DJ Meow on the stage ladies and gentlemen \ud83d\ude39", "When my kids were small I would have loved their dad to be that involved. It's amazing that you do that during your busy work day. You are a gem of a dad. So many men don't take an active parent roll in their childrens lives. Most men dont seem to care at all. It's beautiful that you talk to him in the morning like that. And he sounds just as awesome as you. Please don't stop. He would miss it if you stopped. Good job dad and you do the night time routine too. Wow.", "NTA I am stay home mom and let the kid without any interaction in the morning is so sad!", "Why is OP letting his wife be a SAHM when he clearly doesn't trust her to take care of herself, let alone their child? Why not ask her to get a job and cut back on his own hours at work so that he can spend more time being a parent, since it seems that he thinks he would be better at it? \n\nOP have you considered changing/checking the baby's diaper before leaving for work? If it's that urgent and the mom isn't doing it (regardless of her health issues), why are you not being proactive?\n\nOP says that the mom \"forgets\" to take her B12 supplement, the quotes implying that he doesn't believe she's actually forgetting. Some of the symptoms of B12 deficiency are brain fog and memory issues. Why would she lie about forgetting?\n\nOP have you considered calling your wife to say good morning and reminding her to take her B12, since you're already calling anyway?  (One of OP's comments mention that mom has chronic fatigue on top of other health issues, and that medication isn't working.)\n\nCan the mom hear the video call from bed? It would probably be really sweet, hearing dad tell baby how much he loves him. Until you get a call and it's full of resentment and judgment telling you that you're not good enough and invalidating your health issues (because the way OP put \"forgets\" in quotation marks and conveniently left out the chronic fatigue diagnosis and medication not working, I get a strong suspicion that he doesn't take the mom's health issues seriously, and instead just thinks that she's lazy and a liar).\n\nFor all we know, mom could be ignoring OP's phone calls because she doesn't want to be talked down to and micromanaged first thing in the morning. And isn't it possible that she knows that OP is gonna do a video call and wants that to be a part of baby's routine in the morning?\n\nHad the baby been changed during the night, possibly contributing to mom's fatigue?\n\nAnother comment by OP states that baby is hitting all of his milestones, which is great!\n\nI noticed that when quoting mom, OP emphasized that it was \"EVERY morning to tell me how to be a mom,\" and it seems to me that more attention could be paid to the last half of that. \"to tell me how to be a mom.\" Would she get angry if he called every morning to tell her good morning and that he loved her and asked about the baby in a supportive way? \n\n\"Well your routine sucks,\" is a bit of an AH-ish remark to make, considering baby is hitting all of his milestones. Nobody wants to start off their day with a loved one telling them that they aren't good enough.  \n\nAnd her parenting might not be good enough! But there are better ways to address that issue.\n\nOP, you're looking out for your baby's best interest. Have you tried framing things that way? Instead of attacking your partner's parenting skills, have you considered expressing your concern and talking about finding a routine that works for the both of you?", "trust me, mothers get shit on all day long and are constantly judged.", "Wow you clearly have no idea what it\u2019s like dealing with a chronic illness. One of the reasons I\u2019m child free is that I know I couldn\u2019t wake up and care for a baby. I can sleep 20hrs a day and still feel like I haven\u2019t slept at all. I need multiple alarms in the morning. Sometimes someone to prod me awake because I turn off my alarm while I\u2019m sleep drunk and go straight back to sleep. I\u2019m not really awake. It can take me hours to wake up. I really feel for this poor woman. She isn\u2019t getting the help she needs and burning the candle at both ends won\u2019t help anyone. Maybe sitting down with your wife and asking her what she needs to function and feel like a human. Maybe someone to come in for a few hrs during the morning could help? If you don\u2019t have a debilitating illness like this you will never truly understand. Chronic illness steals our lives and the general lack of understanding and empathy from the general public doesn\u2019t help us at all.", "I don\u2019t think you quite understand how serious chronic fatigue can be. It\u2019s not something that just taking b12 can automatically fix. While taking them may help, but it\u2019s a chronic illness. It\u2019ll be present still.", "To Be fair though, if he\u2019s reminding her of stuff all the time anyways, has he considered trying to help her Reiner her b12?", "Oh my god, as a parent of a toddler, I can't believe how far I had to scroll down to find this. Having a kid who sleeps twelve full hours every night is so rare, and they're repaying that gift with neglect. If the mom can't wake up by 8 am, then she shouldn't be a stay at home parent for a toddler.", "Some people just sleep a lot, some sleep very little. I don't think it's very weird. I often sleep about 6 hours and do just fine on that.", "She has bad narcolepsy.", "I've been searching for this comment - thank you! The ableism in this entire thread is shocking. OPs \"forgets\" thing in particular really wound me up. I'm autistic and have ADHD and my husband has ADHD too. The implication that she's lying about forgetting is such a reflection on how this guy has made no effort to try and understand the complexity of his wife's needs. ND people (especially ADHDers) have no control over what they remember, and often have different cicadian rhythms and need more sleep than others owing to busy brains. If he keeps calling her to disrupt her routine and stress her out, these things will only get worse. YTA OP. Like huge massive giant YTA.\n\nEdit: fixing a typo.", "Edgar?", "My daughter legit tried to rub her head against her first playdate like a cat does. Then she hugged her.", "Someone has never babied before", "I think the baby is just a quiet kid lol.", "I still don\u2019t understand how he knows the baby is awake and alone for hours in the morning? OP says he logs on turns the night light in, says good morning and then calls and wakes his wife. \n\nIf he only logged in for the first time that day, how on earth does he know when the baby woke up? Has it been mentioned anywhere?", "I love the phrase baby thoughts. Wonder what a little babies think about", "Mine went to Purina \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "One time I was a baby but I don\u2019t remember it", "I\u2019m gonna go with ESH.  I\u2019m no parent, but it definitely seems shitty that your wife just leaves the baby for hours. That doesn\u2019t seem good.  I feel like most people would raise an eyebrow if they heard that a parent leaves their baby alone in the crib for hours.  However, no offense, but you kind of seem like a type A nightmare personality.  I honestly can\u2019t believe your wife hasn\u2019t gone postal with this level of micro managing.  I feel like the two of you guys have to find a happy medium.  Something where the wife takes care of the baby to your satisfaction, and you don\u2019t micromanage the fuck out her entire life.", "This seems pretty polarizing, but I'm gonna split the difference and say ESH. Definitely sounds like mom should've got the kid up sooner, but being remotely micromanaged like that would be enough to drive anyone crazy", "Idk, I agree about OP but am more inclined to say NAH than point the finger at OP\u2019s wife. This is clearly a case of both parents running on low energy and not handling the situation in the most optimal way. Yes, OP\u2019s wife shouldn\u2019t be neglecting her own child just because she needs a bit more me-time, and yet we can\u2019t really ask more of her due to her medical condition. (And yes, OP is technically micromanaging, but he\u2019s not wrong for wanting his son to be neglected for an hour either.) I think what a lot of folks here are missing is that raising a toddler optimally is hard and requires a level of endurance that not every parent has at the get-go. Clearly the wife doesn\u2019t have it atm. They\u2019re both trying; they both should communicate better, but no one is an asshole", "You named your whiskas?", "Exactly. Mine just chills by himself on the morning for an hour ish just for whatever reason. He's like me and the bf where he needs some time to actually wake up before getting his day started with rampaging."]}
