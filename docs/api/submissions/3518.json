He has a great sleep routine. Our \"wind down\" time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours.\n\nIt's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says \"Dada\". Then I leave the app, call my wife to wake her up.\n\nI usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day.\n\nThis morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with \"well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called\".\n\nI just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play.\n\nAm I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers.

I don't get these YTA posts, if he didn't call to wake her up every morning how long would the kid be in the crib? I'm a mom as well and have been through this phase, if the child sleeps for 12 hrs which is really about the max they will sleep at that age, then he is getting up at about 8 am. Yes, it's good and fine for him to have alone time and quiet time, but leaving him alone until 10 am (2 hrs) is absolutely not acceptable. 1 hour  alone in the morning is also too much IMO. We let our 2 year old have alone time in the morning while we get adjusted, but it's about 10-15 minutes max.

Is there a safe place for your kid to play with minimal supervision while your spouse is making breakfast? I would shift focus into seeing if there is a problem there and helping to solve it, or insist that you guys get a morning nanny or something. 2 hours is a really really long time for solo mornings and I agree with others that the kid might accept this bc it\u2019s his norm now but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ideal.\nOh, another info - is his diaper area skin healthy?

He\u2019s needs a diaper change, and probably hungry!\nI understand an hour, letting your wife wake up, shower makes coffee get herself ready and then get the baby! But more than 2 hours and she\u2019s still dead asleep, having to call her 3 times before she answers. Your son is getting older, and that\u2019s when babies start climbing out of the crib. Maybe you need to sit with your wife and figure out what\u2019s going on, if she in fact does have her routine with the baby and these are just off days you seen her in.\n\nEdit: Op has stated in the comments that his wife has chronic fatigue, but she doesn\u2019t take her b12 shots because she forgets. Baby sleeps thru the night, mom is able to sleep thru the night, her waking up late is her choice. She\u2019s a mother now, her baby relies on her to eat! Him not crying isn\u2019t even the point, he\u2019s at the age will he will start getting curious, getting out the crib and exploring. Her establishing a routine with her son would work better for her, she can nap when he naps. If she\u2019s not able to force herself to get up, She and Op need to sit down and discuss getting help. Again him entertaining himself is not the issue, the issue is being awake for hours before mom acknowledges him. Accidents happen even when your watching, but being left unsupervised the risk is bigger. All these YTA comments are only looking out for the wife, what about the baby?! Would you still say YTA if it was the dad sleeping in, we\u2019re always so quick to judge the fathers but not the mothers.\n\n\nThank you guys for the awards\u263a\ufe0f", "Info: is she up with him during the night while you are sleep?", "YTA.

Your wife should have a schedule, babies need it and she shouldn't be relying on you to wake her up. However, I don't think you're going about this in the most productive way. You and your wife clearly don't agree on this and you need to make a parenting plan and daily schedule you're both happy with. Crucially, you need to be willing to swap roles if that would work better for your son.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, let's start with the fact that your kid is now into toddler range as opposed to infant.  Your kid can manage a few moments alone in their crib and will still cry if they need any worthwhile attention.\n\nSecondly, let's say she took the toddler with her while preparing the food. Your kid is now in learning escape methods, getting into crap, cause mischief stage.

No I didn't. I said what he is doing is creepy and suggested two alternatives of changing his hours to be there himself, or hiring help. I wouldn't suggest alternatives if I thought it was all fine as is. Don't attack people for things they didn't say.\n\nAlso, if you are now about to say anything along the lines of \"maybe he can't afford to do either of those\", here is OPs response, emphasis in bold is mine.\n\n> Do you honestly believe that it's acceptable to go to bed at 9:00 and sleep until 12:00 even though you have a toddler at home that wakes up at 8:00? **I shouldn't have to be there nor should I have to spend money on someone to care for my child when his mother is perfectly capable.**\n\nSo its not the money, its the principle. OP doesn't care as much about his son's welfare as he does the principle that his wife should be fine by herself. Except she clearly isn't. But OP is going to change nothing and keep up his Big Brother act instead.\n\nAnd presumably OP is also going to keep ignoring everyone asking how he knows the toddler wakes up at 8am if he doesn't check the camera until 9am, or why he keeps changing how long his wife sleeps in the comments.", "I have 2 kids and my husband did exactly this minus the monitor checking as we didn't have one that nice. He knew when baby would wake up and hed call to make sure I had got up when the kid did or if the baby woke up before he went to work he'd make sure I was up before he left. Our kids are 10 and 3 now and he still does that. I can't personally handle leaving my awake baby in the crib alone in the dark for any longer than it would take for me to run to the bathroom, a few hours is crazy imo. I like that my husband let's me sleep but also makes sure I get up. Maybe your wife is overwhelmed tho and it feels like more than a nice gesture to her. Maybe she feels judged or that you're saying shes incapable of doing it on her own. I do know that narcolepsy meds make it difficult to wake up so I can see your call being needed especially if it takes multiple tries to get her, I'd worry about sleeping thru the baby crying because my husband has when he was taking those meds. I can see both sides on this so I don't want to make a vote on the judgement but I don't exactly think either parent is wrong here. I am sorry it's a thing tho and hopefully it's only temporary.

The baby needs a diaper change most likely, needs to be fed, and shouldn\u2019t be left unattended for an hour anyways.

But neither of us are sleeping while a child or children are awake! Babies absolutely do learn not to cry if nobody comes for them. They need fed regularly to avoid hunger and they need changed regularly to avoid nappy rash and infections. \n\n\nThe question is, why is the wife sleeping in so late every day? Why is she not up with the child? Is she not sleeping through the night? Is she up watching TV or on the internet and so too tired to get up? Is she depressed? Is she struggling? Why is she leaving the baby all alone while she does the breakfast? Most mums have the baby in the same room as them, talking to them and interacting with them. This is an important part of a child\u2019s development.\n\n\nI feel the mum might be struggling or needing more time to herself. I feel something isn\u2019t quite right. Rather than accusing, OP needs to gently get to the bottom of this, as I feel this isn\u2019t really normal or ok long term. \n\n\nNTA, but that\u2019s not to say your wife is.

Your son shouldn't have to cry for attention or be pushed to a point where he's miserable enough to cry and wake her up. That's going to be a really hard habit to break. Leaving him for two hours alone, awake, wet, and getting hungry when they need fed so often? PPD lasts a while, maybe ask your wife how she's feeling and if she needs any help? Consider daycare for half days maybe? That is your child too and you're allowed to be concerned for his health and wellbeing. Pointing out your concerns is not an insult to your wife's parenting skills", "NTA. I'm a bit horrified by the people saying that you are. If the toddler is sleeping through the night, that means everyone is or should be sleeping through the night. There's no reason for her not to wake up at a reasonable time and make sure that he's changed so he's not sitting in his pee and poop. And how is she going to fix his breakfast first and then change him, which means breakfast could be cold by the time she gets done. I would hate to be micromanaged too, but there's a reason she needs to be micromanaged right now.", "NTA. It blows my mind that she sleeps that late and long after your kid wakes up. And then to refuse to go in there until breakfast is ready is so odd. I always want to see my little ones when they get up, especially when they were babies. I lived for those morning snuggles. Maybe she is feeling burnt out and needs a day to herself and someone can watch your son? Her behavior is off to me and I probably would have reacted the same as you.", "NTA. It\u2019s messed up that she sleeps in so late and then still doesn\u2019t go to him.", "NTA. Kind of shocked how many people are saying YTA. I have a toddler and cannot even imagine leaving him in his crib for 1-2 HOURS every morning. It\u2019s one thing to let them hang for a bit, but your wife is a grown woman, what is she doing sleeping until 10am?? This is borderline neglect. You are doing the right thing and I would suggest pursuing therapy if she thinks leaving a child in his crib for 2 hours after he wakes up is acceptable.", "NTA. Your wife has issues guy. She doesn't work and sleeps in until 9 or 10am and then leaves the child with a wet diaper and an empty belly while she farts around making her own breakfast? \nI can understand that she doesn't want to be micromanaged. However, her behavior says she needs to be 'managed' in order for her to provide the child with basic needs. \nYou need to get off reddit and talk to your spouse.", "NTA \n\nYour wife needs to step up and take care of your child or she might have PPD. Get her into therapy.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly sad that you need to tell your wife to care for her own child who doesn\u2019t cry anymore because he KNOWS as an infant that she will not come when he cries", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBaby should not be sitting by himself for that long. 10-15 mins, understandable.  Up to two hours? Neglect", "NTA\n\nI don't know why everyone think this is micromanaging considering the following;\n\n\"My son is a **20 month old** toddler\", \n\n\"**he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00**. He has a great sleep routine.\", \n\n\"when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and **sleeps all night for at least twelve hours**.\"\n\n\"It's usually **after 9:00 before I have a chance to check** the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and **some mornings are closer to 10:00**. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting.\"\n\n\"I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. **He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play.**\"\n\nSo we have basically an almost 2 year old here who isn't potty trained yet. Googling around shows that on an average day a toddler above the 12 month range will usually go through about 7 diapers a day which is about *1 every 3.5ish hours.* \n\nGoogling around also shows that when a child is between 2-3 years old the longest they should be left alone while awake, even for solo play, is around *30 minutes*. \n\nGoogling ALSO says that kids in the 2-3 year range should be eating roughly *5-6 times a day (3 meals, 2-3 snacks) about every 2-3 hours while awake.* That's not counting drinking which should be much more frequent.\n\nSo we are looking at a child who is unable to take care of themselves ***being awake and left alone in the dark*** for at least an hour usually, sometimes even up to two hours.\n\nIt is neglect. Yes, the wife should probably see someone about potential ppd or depression, and yeah the OP is probably annoying the shit out of her every day waking her up. But if OP wasn't preforming a wakeup call at an honestly decent time everyday how long would she be sleeping and the child be left alone? The kid is being neglected here by the mother, and the childs health and safety are foremost here.", "i was gonna say NTA because im just as apprehensive. I don't wait more than 3 hours to change him and my son has a very structured routine. Im sorry but most people here don't know what is like. I get it's annoying and you're 'micromanaging' but for babies time runs different and sadly you need to sacrifice sleep hours for them. We're the adults but they deserve to be attended since they wakeup. Mine is 8mo and sleeps with me coz he hates the crib. but he sleeps on his own and respect his hours. I'd feel like an asshole if i had him waiting for more than an hour for me to check up on him. Just my opinion as a mom.", "So your toddler spends 14 hrs a day in his crib, at least two of those hours awake and with a wet/dirty diaper? Nothing to eat or drink? Then you\u2019re wife is definitely a problem. And it\u2019s cute for you to say hi to the kiddo. But the way you\u2019re communicating with your wife isn\u2019t working. ESH. Try some actual communication.", "NTA - whether or not he\u2019s crying isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s the fact he\u2019s gone so long without a drink, being fed or having a diaper change.

You check in on him every day and let him know you're around for him. His mum? Not so much.

At this point your son may be better off in daycare where he\u2019ll be fed and changed regularly and will get playtime and interaction with other kids.

That is not good for baby!! Plus, that baby needs food/bottle after 12+hours in bed. The fact your baby does not cry/scream sounds like neglect. That child has been conditioned to be ignored and that's really sad!! \n\nSo, the real question, what is wrong with your wife!?! Is she depressed?? Are there other signs besides sleeping a lot??? Is she able to cook/clean/perform typical SAHM tasks?? I have a feeling she is having issues that you do not see. It's time for some help!! Part time nanny or daycare, maybe a family member can help.

I would be curious to know how often she leaves the child in his playpen or other rooms alone unattended or plops him in front of the TV all day to get out of her hair.\n\nAs a stay-at-home mother, it is OP's wife's *literal job* to care for her child and she is a major AH for not taking that job as seriously as she should. A good parent doesn't need to be nudged or reminded by the other to give their child basic needs: food, diaper changes, and attention. The fact that she doesn't even have an alarm set and dad needs to call 4-5 times just to wake her up is disturbing and demonstrates that even if the baby was crying she wouldn't get up. \n\nThank God that this little boy has at least one parent who is prioritizing his needs and thinking about him even while he is away at work.\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA.

I\u2019m a young adult with no children and even I know a babies diaper had to be checked and changed even if it\u2019s clean as soon as you get up.", "I\u2019m a young adult with no kids and I still think that leaving a baby alone for 2 hours while you wake up is shitty. I wouldn\u2019t even do that to my dog.", "BTW have Y T A in your comment counts as a vote.\nAlso I have no children and think OP is NTA, it's just basic common sense not to leave anyone in their own urine and shit, with zero hydration. If it was an animal I'd scream neglect... this is a *child*.", "Dad assumes he sleeps 12 hours because he isn't woken up at night... But he works 12 hour days and likely sleeps like the dead himself. If he was in a diaper for 14 plus hours a day he would have a rash", "OP said he doesn\u2019t check until 9am and somehow \u201cknows\u201d his son wakes up at 8am. So even if it is an hour later, he\u2019s not crying to daddy through the camera then I think he\u2019s fine", "Thank you. I was looking for someone to point out that the kid Knows that dad will call on the monitor now and is up waiting on that call!", "He makes it sound like the wife tends to the child fine during the day or whatever (just from the lack of mentioning anything else) and his only real problem is her sleeping for a bit longer. I really don\u2019t understand all the people jumping to say the wife is abusing the child, or that he\u2019s NTA. The wife is still a human being with needs too, and unless she is truly being neglectful to a point of legitimate worry (you wouldn\u2019t need to ask if you\u2019re the asshole asking her to take care of the kid if he truly knew the kid was getting abused), getting a little extra sleep for a bit doesn\u2019t seem like such a crime. Idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb just my thoughts on it.", "Right? For one everyone is making assumptions on the fact that child hasn\u2019t been changed for \u201c8-12 hours\u201d we have no idea when the last time they got up to change the kid was. And the mother has needs of her own. Also, someone wouldn\u2019t need to ask if they\u2019re an asshole if they really believed the child was being abused for Christ\u2019s sake", "There's a big difference between leaving them in their room to fall asleep when all their needs have been met and leaving them alone for hours once they are awake. I'll lay the baby down to go to sleep by herself. She might fuss a minute or two but then she's out. But when she wakes up? I'm there within ten minutes (usually much quicker than that) to give her what she needs even though she usually wakes up happy and talking. I can't imagine leaving her for an hour or more. Beyond the obvious desire to meet her physical needs, I want to spend time with her when she's awake.", "Who says non-parents have no experience? Many can be teachers, nannies, elder siblings who have practically raised their younger siblings, social workers or/and have studied childhood development. Instead of judging non-parents and dismissing their views, why don\u2019t you just listen and maybe you\u2019ll learn something (they may have a different viewpoint that you haven\u2019t thought of that may help), if not then just go on about your day.", "The reason it\u2019s not recommended isn\u2019t that it\u2019s cruel to leave babies alone though, the reason is people misuse it. After the baby is 6 months it *is* recommended to let them cry at small intervals at first and then longer intervals to see if they can calm themselves, but when they don\u2019t calm themselves you still have to go in and try to help. Full detachment and letting them cry for hours until they stop is when it\u2019s debated that psychological affects and emotional issues or sleeping issues can start to occur. Just putting that here before someone claims I\u2019m saying you can never leave a baby to cry at all and every parent is neglectful", "I see him advocating. If asking Reddit questions was a problem, Reddit wouldn\u2019t exist.", "Mom should learn how to set up an alarm. Full stop.\n\n She already knows when the baby wakes up and he shouldn't be sitting alone in a dirty diaper with an empty tummy bc she can't figure out how to wake up earlier without assistance.", "These comments are honestly infuriating. That poor kid.", "Yeah during wake hours you\u2019re SUPPOSED to change every two hours unless it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s a potty already. 14 hour diaper is just screaming diaper rash. Poor kid.", "I know my child and when they wake up in the morning, so yeah. Being a stay at home parent is a job, morning duties are a big part of that job. Waking up with your kids until they are old enough to use the potty by themselves and get themselves at least a snack is being a parent. This poor kid is sitting in a dark room for 2 hours is terrible parenting. Kids that young are only awake about 12 hours a day so 16% of this kids awake time is spent by themselves, in the dark, in a full diaper. That\u2019s gross and if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s gross then\u2026yikes is all I have to say.", "Literally, how did all these babies manage before nanny cams? Oh yeah, they cried when they needed something. And wife gets up when he cries so all good", "It's obviously a learned behavior. The baby probably fussed at first but learned that doesn't seem to work and now just stays quiet until dad wakes up mom. Would YOU let your baby sit in their urine for an extra  hour or two? (16 hrs total from evening to morning)\n\nMom should set an alarm since baby seems to have his own schedule and its HER job to work around it.", "If you know your baby is up earlier than you waking up, just prepare accordingly til you get used to the new hours. Alarms exist for decades.", "Yup! Solid sleep, so that\u2019s a good thing, means the child has adjusted to a good sleep routine.\n\nSounds like OP is minimizing the health problem with mom and not prioritizing this as crucially important.\n\nB12 is a bandaid fix. It\u2019s temporary solution for a longterm issue. \n\nMy guess is iron deficiency or glucose issues affecting her with a mild case of burnout. \n\nShe needs a day to herself to rest completely from everything, eat a balanced adult meal, and RELAX with no obligations for 12hrs straight. \n\nOp needs to request a day off so mom can R+R.", "Thank you! I also think she is getting up to change him at night and dad is just sleeping through it.", "AND he does the bedtime routine", "I am a total feminist, but people like to really come down on men.  That poor baby has to wait in bed while mom sleeps in.  Parenthood is hard.  I am of the generation where a lot of moms stayed home while the kids were young and the dads worked long hours.  People had 3 or 4 kids.  It is not that hard to care for one child and a home while your partner is working and commuting 10 to 14 hours a day.  Dad should think twice before having a second kid.", "Agree. 100%.", "Considering that OP works 12 hour shifts 6 days a week you are being extremely harsh on them. I\u2019ve worked like that for 5 days a week for a few months and I most literally wanted to end myself, because it\u2019s torture when your job and sleep are taking up most of your life. It seems that for OP it\u2019s not negotiable too: believe me, those negligent parents that do everything to avoid their kids would not be caring enough to talk with their kids over video while they work.\n\nIt is very likely that the mother has PPD, I agree. But believe me, with a job like that you can hardly mention anything around you, especially a mental illness. It\u2019s admirable they even find time for their kid at all, at least see that *something* is wrong in their family and are sincerely asking for advice. But you really need to get your own shit sorted out to be able to mention someone has mental health issues. And working 72 hours a week is not shit sorted out, nope. In this scenario, it\u2019s a miracle they even see anything besides their personal needs.", "My mother told me that when I was a baby she used to leave me in the baby swing most of the day and I was perfectly content. The whole conversation came about because she said my house was messy because I was holding my baby too much. My mother and I have never been very close.", "Yeah, if this post was about someone leaving a dog in a cage for 14 hours per day they\u2019d be absolutely eviscerated. Doubt we\u2019d get mountains of comments highlighting the importance of dogs \u201cself-soothing\u201d in a piss-soaked bed", "There isn\u2019t? When two of mine woke up they\u2019d love playing quietly alone. Now that they\u2019re bigger they are more vocal about this special quiet alone time (but in the summer the 3 of us tiptoe out of the house to go fishing very early in the AM and we fish and don\u2019t talk and it\u2019s so special). As long as a parent is attentive when need is expressed, there is absolutely nothing wrong with letting a toddler play independently.", "I do. Excepting maybe elder siblings, nobody else is getting up with toddlers and babies early in the morning or in the middle of the night and knows their words and their moods etc.\n\nMy SIL was the worst for this, she\u2019s an ECE so she claims to be a child development expert, but she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be up every 90 minutes with a teething baby and then parent them all day. Yes, I\u2019m letting her watch a cartoon now because JFC I\u2019m exhausted.", "This. You should align your schedule to match your kids. The kid wakes up at 8 am it\u2019s not like it\u2019s 5 or 6. Not unreasonable. Being a parent is a full time job.", "Seriously! Not to mention that first thing a professional is going to tell an extremely overwhelmed parent to do is to put the baby somewhere SAFE so they can regroup (like their crib), and to call someone for support. Doesn\u2019t sound like mom is getting a ton of support, and it\u2019s better to let lil buddy play quietly while she gets some extra rest than to swallow back that overwhelm until she can\u2019t anymore. That\u2019s how kids end up getting abused, unfortunately. We\u2019ve all read a news story that sent a chill down our spine at some point", "But does she?  If she\u2019s not waking up for the first 2 or 3 phone calls right by her head, does she hear the baby in another room??", "Yep. The baby have most likely tried crying and yelling, and it havent worked, so the baby gave up. \n Seeing how the dad needs to call a few times before the mom reacts, i guess she dont hear the baby at all.\nIf she's up first around 10, the baby have to be SO hungry!? My kids eat lunch at 11-12..", "THIS. you\u2019re a Fucking SAHM. OP stated baby sleeps all night, and he seems like a pretty involved parent for someone who works so much. Whether wife needs meds or therapy is irrelevant. No kid should have to sit in a shitty diaper, with no food or water, for HOURS while mom sleeps. Either she gets up, or they hire help. If she needs therapy, get it. But neglecting a 20 month is not an option. If wife is getting an acceptable amount of sleep - aka OP isn\u2019t leaving all chores/work to her after baby goes to bed - there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON why she can\u2019t get up at 8 am to take care of her child. Jfc. \n\nNot to mention, for all those saying \u201cif the baby needed her he would cry\u201d - it takes OP 3-4 phone calls (presumably her cell is right next to her) to wake her up?? That baby would be crying for a WHILE before she realized it. Not ok. \n\n*before anyone comes for me, I\u2019m a single working mom and I would never do this. Being a parent is exhausting. That doesn\u2019t mean you can sleep through it*", "This! When my kids were little I always did that or early in the morning before they officially woke up cause I'm a sahm. My kids often got up still dry or had freshly peed. We don't know if she is too, but that's a pretty normal thing to do. And dads often don't notice.", "AND the kid sleeps through the night so she doesn't have her sleep interrupted.", "And child sleeps all  night", "Sounds like a great baby too! 12 hours of sleep a day!?! I felt so blessed when our second was doing 9 hrs straight. 12 would be a godsend.", "feminism is about supporting men too. you can\u2019t uphold the patriarchy with emotionally intelligent men. feminism isn\u2019t solely about women. people come down on men because of patriarchal standards.", "Exactly, you can encourage someone to go and get help and even organise it for them but if they don\u2019t want to go then you just can\u2019t force them.", "So true. Mine even got referrals from the doctor and she never did. She would tell me she was talking to the therapist but just came to find out she never saw a therapist not once. My baby mama just chose to cheat instead while i worked.", "How did he fail?", "You\u2019re exactly right, sometimes I worry for society after being on this app and seeing some of the things people say", "This is actually probably true, and incredibly sad.", "Thank you. I will fully admit that I had my opinions (to myself!) before I had a kid. The sheer amount of time spent just being there is insane. And ofcourse everyone around you is more careful than you, as you know your child's boundaries best. \n\nBy the time you get so sleep deprived that driving becomes unsafe (and missing a few hours one night impairs you as much as drinking some alcohol, let alone no uninterrupted sleep for months) you NEED to handle your kids sleep. For everyone's safety. A well rested parent is much more attentive and positive throughout the day, and less likely to fight with their partner. The kid learns to fall asleep by themselves (again, after being cared for, cuddled and loved, while monitored from outside the room) and honestly, 20 minutes of crying is not the insane amount of abuse redditors are alleging here. \n\nYou're not just parenting your child, you are also taking care of yourself, driving, working etc. Good parenting means safety first.", "Exactly^ he calls MULTIPLE TIMES because she is out cold.\n\n Either she needs to get to bed earlier ( I get it, I've been a sahm to 2 boys so post bed time is mommy time but sleep is important too, don't recall if the post clarified when she goes to sleep) or she needs to set alarms to get up with her child. Obviously the dad that works full time knows the kids schedule so the parent that actually STAYS HOME should too, she is CHOOSING not to get up at this point and that's the part that's the most ducked up. \n\nIf she doesn't want to be \"micro-managed\" (even though if op slept in and was late to work he would be in the dog house for it) then she should do what she agreed to do by being the SAHP and take proper care of her child.  Once that kid learns to climb out of the crib it's going to start getting dangerous. She needs to either buck up or they need to sit down and have a serious discussion to figure out a solution together before it gets to that point.", "Right?? Everyone saying \u201che\u2019d cry if he needed her\u201d like no? This is exactly how attachment disorders are formed. Babies don\u2019t get any response = stop crying. It\u2019s sad.", "THIS ^", "If the kid doesn't bother to call for his mom, when he is awake, why should he bother at night. Probably he wakes up and just feels lonely, so he goes to sleep again \ud83d\ude25"]}
