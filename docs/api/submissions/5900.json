Our kids are from our previous marriages.\n\nLily's dad is a deadbeat but Mia and Sean's mother is active in their lives.\n\nOnto the story. For context, Mia and Sean for the longest time have always wanted a pet and always beg me and my husband for a dog or a cat. They are total animal lovers and they both want to be vets when they grow up. \n\nUnfortunately getting a pet is not something we can do at the moment. My husband have talked about it a few times and we may consider getting a small pet, such as rats or gerbils, in the future.\n\nFor Christmas, my MIL got Mia and Sean a sea monkeys kit each and they were over the moon and super excited waiting for them to hatch. They opened these gifts on Christmas Eve because my husband's family celebrates it then.\n\nOn Christmas day, while I was at work (the joys of shift work), my husband said Lily poured the contents of the plastic tanks into the toilet and flushed it. Mia and Sean were heartbroken and wouldn't stop crying.\n\nIt turns out that it was \"a prank\" and Lily was keeping the sea monkeys in another plastic tub in her room. She admitted she recorded Mia and Sean's reactions and was going to post it on tiktok. I made her delete the video. \n\nI honestly cannot comprehend why she'd do something like that, this is so out of character for Lily who's normally a very kind outgoing girl. I've asked her why she did it but she kept saying she just thought it would be funny, and didn't expect Mia and Sean to become so upset. She said they're only sea monkeys anyway and Mia and Sean are oversensitive.\n\nI thought about it for a little while and I decided on consequences.\n\n1. Grounded for 2 months except for school extracurriculars.\n2. No smartphone or allowance for 1 month, and Lily will use my spare Nokia to call or text us or other family members as needed. She can use the family computer if she needs the internet for homework.\n3. Lily has to write a sincere apology letter to Mia and Sean. No video games until it's done.\n\nIt might seem over-the-top but this was a big deal in our household, and even after they got the sea monkeys back, Mia and Sean haven't been quite themselves.\n\nLily obviously wasn't happy about the consequences and is doing a teenage sulk and says I'm being unfair. She texted my dad and complained to him. \n\nMy dad likes to take Lily out on shopping sprees and spoil her, and with her grounded that won't be allowed. He called me and asked what happened. \n\nI explained everything and he said I'm being too harsh on his grandbaby and that what she did was only minor and I'm overreacting. \n\nI told him if he wants to see Lily he's welcome to come over but no spoiling her with gifts like he usually does. He called me a Grinch for grounding my daughter on Christmas and not letting him treat her, then ended the call.", "created_utc": 1672281029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxt2mg/aita_for_grounding_my_daughter_on_christmas_over/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m assuming Lily thought it would be funny based on what she consumes on the app. \n\nNTA, but maybe monitor her social media uses a little more and choose one (not all three) of those punishments. Just my two cents.", "What she did was not minor. She faked animal cruelty in order to cause psychological damage to *children* who are younger than her, because - *checks notes* - she thought it would be funny??? You are sending a clear message to her that bullying will not be tolerated. NTA.", "NTA- she did the wrong thing and should be punished for it. It was a cruel thing to do, especially on Christmas Day. \n\nThe problem is this is a teachable moment and I don\u2019t see anything about her learning that what she sees on TikTok is often staged and not real \u2018pranks.\u2019 She\u2019s overstepped a boundary, but does she understand where the line is and why?", "NTA *but* you should find a way to climb down from the 2 months, it's too much. The loss of phone & letter will be more than sufficient & entirely appropriate - & perhaps a warning about reviewing her use of tiktok (toxic pos for teens) if anything like this happens again.\n\nMaybe make the 2 months conditional based on the quality of her letter? \n\n\nHave to bear in mind you need to leave room for future punishments.", "NTA for giving consequences/punishments but I feel like the ones you gave were disproportionate and disconnected from what she did. \n\n2 months of being grounded? I think taking the phone off her was fair and also make sure to ban usage of social media for the 2 months. It's fair enough that you don't want people spoiling her for a bit whilst she reflects on her poor behaviour. But not going out aside from school for 2 months seems not relevant to what she did. It sounds like this was motivated by tiktok, so just ban use of tiktok and similar apps for a couple of months until she grows up and learns that pranks aren't funny.", "NTA - she's 14 years old, doing something cruel like that to other kids who are younger for a tiktok video is awful. I don't think you're overreacting at all. Furthermore, you're the parent here and it's your decision.", "I don't think you're the AH but as a parent of four (21, 19, 17 & 15) I do think you are being too harsh. Two months grounding is huge in the life of a teen. It's also more likely to cause resentment to the younger step siblings imo, even though they did nothing. We talk a lot about consequences and, with my kids, I find that when they are particularly mean it's often because they have been thoughtless rather than out of malice. A 'put yourself in their shoes' discussion goes a long way. That said, I don't know what consequences I would recommend since I don't know your household, maybe something that involves cheering up the younger kids - like taking them to a local dog park or cat cafe, since they like pets?\n\nGood luck. Parenting teens is tough, and a split family is an extra challenge, I imagine.", "NTA - This is the second sub post this week with a 'prank' and both people stated, \"They (victims) are being  over sensitive...it's just a prank.\" Her actions now have the younger children question feeling safe around her. She completely broke their trust.  Be careful calling her actions 'minor'. It was calculating, cruel, recorded and posted (minors on tiktok).", "This does seem like a pretty extreme punishment. You need to allow yourself room to grow for worse punishments in the future and you've already set the bar way too high.", "NTA \n\nI agree that this was a very serious prank. Maybe she didn't think about it enough before acting on it, but the fact that she planned it out and recorded it says a lot. Obviously she didn't expect the reaction from her siblings or you.\n\nThat being said, I've always believed the punishment should fit the crime. I'm not sure what 2 full months of being grounded will accomplish and it seems too long. \n\nI do agree with no internet or social media. Social media is the reason she came up with the prank, so it fits. She needs to learn that TikTok is not real and things that are encouraged there are often harmful. \n\nI would probably make her write a research paper having to do with the harm TikTok causes, but that's me. She would also need to verbalize why what she did was wrong. I wouldn't allow her to be on TikTok or Instagram at all for a very long time.\n\nDocking her allowance doesn't make sense to me either. \n\nI agree that the younger 2 deserve an apology, but I'm not so sure it would be heartfelt if forced. I would not make her apologize until she has really thought about why what she did was so awful. \n\nA person should learn from their mistakes and also their punishment. Punishment shouldn't be out of anger. If it goes on for too long or doesn't make sense, the learning from it is lost.\n\nYou father needs to be shut down immediately. It's not up to him to decide or judge how you raise or discipline your child. He had his turn with his own kids.", "INFO: What is the point of the list of punishments (none of those are discipline beyond the apology, they are punishments)? What is your goal here? Discipline should be a natural consequence of an action. Taking away a tradition she has with her grandfather and banning gifts from him, excessive grounding, no allowance, no phone etc are not natural consequences of a prank that ultimately led to nothing because the Sea Monkeys were returned and unharmed. The apology is happening and the video was deleted. \n\nWas it incredibly impulsive? Yes. Was it a bad prank? Yes. \n\nI am all for discipline. Given that this is your reaction for a relatively minor incident I would hate to see what your reaction would be to something bigger though.", "ESH.  It was a bad prank but the punishment is excessive. Punishment loses context after a week so it's best to keep it heavy but short.\n\nAlso look into the why since it seems out of character.", "NTA because I think pranks like this are cruel, especially when the intent is to hurt someone else. And she was going to make it public. I agree with your instinct to react pretty strongly. Though I think it's reasonable to consider whether your punishment is leading to its intended effect. A punishment that is too harsh won't really teach her any lessons, but will just teach her to resent you. And it can be a good lesson that if she shows remorse and gives a sincere apology, and understands why what she did was wrong, her punishment could potentially be lessened. So maybe sit down and talk with her about it. Let her show you whether or not she really seems to understand why the prank was wrong. If she seems to be truly apologetic, I think it might be kind to allow her to go shopping with her grandfather.", "NTA.  I think two months is too long, but most of this seems to fit to me. That was a really cruel thing to do to two smaller children, and filming it to get likes is obscene. \n\nI think her desire to get big in TikTok is the real issue. Sticking her with the Nokia might do it, but I\u2019d forbid her from making any TikTok posts at all. She\u2019s proven her judgement is not there yet. Not sure if you can do that without deleting her account, but I\u2019d try to hold that in reserve if necessary. Give her a chance to prove she can keep it. Really point out why this was so harmful - pranks are only funny if EVERYBODY is laughing, including the victim.", "NTA for disciplining your kid- but I think 2 months is a bit much. What concerns me is why she did this in the first place. Does she harbor resentment towards her step siblings? Did she not think it through? Is she often inconsiderate of others? I think 2 weeks to a month is fair- but I would also want to find out what was going on in her head.", "NTA. \n\nI do think your punishment is maybe a tad excessive, but I'm not a child psychologist I don't know what the best way to handle this would be.\n\nAt the same time, what your daughter did was very cruel and you've sent your message loud and clear that bullying isn't going to be tolerated. Your heart's in the right place.\n\nYour dad is an AH for trying to undermine you and overstepping.", "I agree with parts of your punishment and disagree with other parts.\n\nYes - make her write the apology - but also have a bit of discussion with her about the reason the kids were so upset, get her to work through what they were thinking/feeling at that moment THEN address with her a bit about WHY she thought it would be funny, what was she aiming for the other kids to feel and express and why that seemed like it would be a 'funny' reaction to her. Essentially prod into her thought process for coming up with the 'prank'. \n\nI would suggest a complete ban on Tiktok (I have never used it, but I already hate it just from the stories I see about the things people post on there) and an easing of the other restrictions depending on the outcome of the discussion you have with her about her motives. \n\nThe \\*ideal\\* outcome from discussing her motives will be that she actually reflects on what she did, and while she may not have been thinking directly about wanting to hurt the younger kids that there was quite probably something of that motive in it. \n\nPlease follow through from that though, is she jealous of her siblings, if so why, what is it she is jealous of. Does she want more one on one time, does she need to see a therapist, what is going on under the bonnet (hood I guess?) that is making her act in a nasty way to her siblings.\n\nWhile I agree that punishment is needed, if there is an underlying jealousy then the extent of the punishment will only serve to make her feel more negatively to them. \n\nSo... yes have serious consequences for the prank. But don't make them so severe that she will backlash against you and her siblings, and try to work with her to find out what her true motive was. And perhaps look at making sure that she is getting the help and attention she needs from the adults in her life if she is struggling. She is also a teen and that is a awful time to be a person without any additional sources of stress, anxiety or jealousy. \n\nOh.. and last thought, make sure everything is good at school, with friends and extended family. It could be displaced emotion targetted at the siblings but caused by something outside the home.", "NTA.\n\nWhat Lily did was cruel and I you are in the right.\n\nBut...\n\nSea Monkeys?  Seriously????  I remember buying the kit off a comics ad....AND THEY WERE JUST BRINE SHRIMP!!!!  We had a fresh water tank at the time and bought live brine shrimp as a treat for the fish!  SEA MONKEYS ARE A RIP OFF!", "NTA cruelty is not funny, also tik tok is just a cesspool.", "I\u2019m gonna go NTA/bordering on a very very soft Y.T.A.\n\nShe does need to have consequences because what she did was very inconsiderate towards Mia and Sean, but I\u2019d probably cut down the time to losing everything for ~1 month, plus the apology letter, and maybe even adding on agreeing to take care of the sea monkeys for a couple of days. 2 months of nothing but extracurriculars is a little bit harsh for what she thought was a harmless prank\n\nETA: I\u2019d probably sit down with her to discuss her actions and how toxic social media is, especially at a young age, and how seeking the somewhat-instant gratification can be damaging to her relationship to her younger step-siblings and friends/family in general", "NTA. Anybody who triggers their own family and records it to become popular is despicable. She should not have access to social media until she understands how horrifying this behavior is.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised to see so many \u201charmless prank\u201d comments. Causing emotional trauma for young kids so you can record their reaction and post to social media is NOT a harmless prank and the fact that the other two are still feeling pain from it should be evidence enough.\n\nI may have different time lines for how long a punishment would last but TikTok would be off the phone permanently.", "NTA.\nNo smartphone for sure\u2014she was filming this for TikTok, so no more TikTok.\nI personally love the apology letter\u2014we did that when one of our son\u2019s bullied another kid and made him hand deliver it to him at his house\u2014it was pretty effective.\nYour dad will have to spoil her another time. And he should actually be proud that you are not raising her to be a little a$&/h8&e.", "Nta for giving consequences", "NTA\n\nWhat are all these people on about? Harmless prank?? That could have been actually traumatizing to the other kids.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty normal to place different amounts of importance on the lives of different animals, and I will freely admit I would be vastly less upset about sea monkeys getting flushed than a cat getting killed, but A) that\u2019s still really bad and B) it\u2019s likely not everyone, particularly young kids, have developed that stratification of importance that many people have. \n\nThose kids thought they had the only pet they\u2019ve been able to have *murdered* by their sibling, in front of them, while being recorded. That\u2019s fucking traumatic. Finding out after that it was fake does not erase the trauma of that moment or the lingering emotions and memories of thinking that had happened. 14 is more than old enough to understand that. Maybe she didn\u2019t get how bad that was, but she\u2019s certainly old enough to.\n\nSome other comments suggest paying more attention to what she\u2019s consuming on the internet, and I completely agree, so it would make sense to alter her punishment to address the issue more directly, but what you\u2019re doing is in no way cruel or unusual punishment (this sub is full of removing privacy and other horrid punishments, none of which you are doing)", "Nta for being angry but 2 months is too long. \n\nYou can't go back on it now but it further alienates her from the other 2 which sounds like it's the source of the prank.  And stupid tiktok", "NTA\nYou're a parent disciplining their child.\nBut Lily needs to understand *why* she's being punished. She violated her sibling's trust and possessions. Perhaps her punishment isn't entirely fitting her crime. The apology letter helps along the right lines, but the taking of her phone and freedoms is probably the wrong direction. Is there something she could do for Mia and Sean to help reassure them that she still cares about them and is sorry?\n\nIf this is out of character, there may be others influencing her. It's probably come from somewhere online, but unless you find the route cause, she'll just go back to it when she gets her phone back.", "ESH.  That prank was exceptionally cruel to her younger stepsiblings, and your punishment is extreme.  Part of the issue with these pranks is that even adults are doing cruel things to young children to post and get attention online.  These videos are everywhere.  Right now, the flavor of the day is the Grinch videos, with young children reacting by panicking and screaming.  It's definitely your job as a parent to deal with this and show Lily this was cruel and that treating her stepsiblings like this will not be tolerated.  With that being said, natural consequences and making amends often go hand in hand and drive the lesson home.  Being grounded for 2 months is excessive.  Taking the smart phone fits with natural consequences, and so would making her delete her Tik Tok account (my underage kids do not have Tik Tok at all).  You need to have her think of ways she can make amends to her stepsiblings as well.  Whether that's writing letters of apology, or her figuring out something nice to do for/with them as a means of letting them know she is truly sorry for hurting them.  Yes, you do need to take action here, I agree.  But I think what you are doing here is going to backfire on you at some point.", "NTA but way over reaction. You have basically painted yourself into a corner because there\u2019s nothing left to take away and she is more likely to act out because of it.  She\u2019s a teenager in an era where these videos are very popular and I am sure she didn\u2019t realize the long term impact. I would encourage an apology but more than that, there needs to be conversations about how even if it\u2019s funny online, it\u2019s not appropriate to do it without permission from the people your do it to.  I have two teenagers and I know that it\u2019s very easy to get caught up in the drama and attention of online media and not fully understand the consequences.", "NTA \n\nLily\u2019s prank was cruel and so the punishment is appropriate", "YTA. \nYou went overboard. She's going to hate the kids more than ever now, and you've shown her she should be extra extra sneaky no matter what because you'll go full on apeshit no matter what.", "YTA for the overkill. Which is what this is. You went overboard with the grounding and you know it. Two weeks to a month with no allowance or electronics would've been more than sufficient.", "I'm going with a slight YTA. Your punishment feels more fitting for her actually flushing the sea monkeys. It's a bit too severe for the equivalent of teaching a dog to play dead and then covering it in fake blood. I get that it was mean but it wasn't cruel.\n\nYour 14 year old needs a lesson on empathy and an explanation that this prank went too far. And that good people don't record others hurting for internet points. But the punishment you've laid out is just not good. You are way too focused on making her feel bad instead of making her understand why what she did was mean. You're punishing her because you're mad, not to help her learn. Writing a letter is not going to work out like you think. She's gonna make it generic \"What do they want me to say?\" You'd be better getting a workbook on empathy or a game like [this](https://www.childtherapytoys.com/products/the-empathy-card-game?variant=28541101894&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&wi=off&gclid=CjwKCAiA76-dBhByEiwAA0_s9bxGhwuXmvvIyIJaZySQFaZGGM1d0I6uupJBg8MpMsKBGwpAeGWHohoCyKYQAvD_BwE).\n\n\nBetter punishment idea: Block TikTok for 3-6 months. She can have other social media, but not TikTok. She hurt her siblings to post it on TikTok, well now she can't use TikTok at all. Punishment fits the crime, you still get an extended punishment period, but she isn't just sulking around grumping and blaming you for making her life terrible. (You can still do like a week of something harsher but this is more fitting to what was done.)", "That's unfortunate, being grounded on Christmas.\n\nHowever, playing a practical joke like that on small children for the sake of some internet clout is beyond disgusting, and it's only too fair that she be taught a valuable lesson on how to conduct herself in the future.\n\nNTA.", "nta, a little harsh maybe but nta. I thik as we become more consumed with our own consumerism and smartphones and social media, we sometimes forget about having empathy for others. I think the old days were better at teaching it, for example, fall off your bike skin your knees and then a few weeks later another kid you know does it, I think you were more likely to go \"oh ouch\" at the very least. But now that social media has allowed us to be rulers of our own little electronic digital domains we have forgotten about other people.", "NTA for grounding her, but 2 months grounding is pretty extreme. I feel like the punishment should fit the crime, like 2 months no TT.", "NTA -", "NTA but I do think the grounding is excessive and will probably end up being more of a punishment for the rest of the family as she sulks around. She'll just end up resenting her step siblings. \n\nI agree with writing a sincere apology and limiting her technology, since she pulled the prank so she could post it online in an attempt to get validation from random strangers.", "NTA", "NTA, that was very mean and lily sounds spoiled", "ESH.That was a pretty shitty prank, but you went a little overboard, especially if this is out of character.", "NTA but you really shouldn\u2019t punish your daughter that much. The prank was not harmless but definitely not a serious offense.", "NTA \n\nWhat Lily did was incredibly cruel. In particular doing it, to film her siblings genuine and vulnerable reactions, to show the world. \n\nThe opinion of strangers was more important than the hurt she caused in the process.\n\nNow that sounds harsh. Lily is only 14. She probably thought providing the sea monkeys didn\u2019t actually get flushed, all would be ok. But as you said, Mia and Sean haven\u2019t been themselves since. It\u2019s had an impact. \n\nAnd it seems like Lily was dismissive of the pets and her siblings feelings when called out for it. \n\nI\u2019m not the parent of a teen. I was also never grounded growing up. 2 months sounds harsh to me but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s standard in your house (or anyone else\u2019s for that matter) \n\nIf you sit down with Lily, explain why it was serious, and tell her she needs to sincerely apologise and the other consequences, and she does what she needs to do, maybe consider reducing the grounding", "INFO 2 months is way too long, but you know that. You are operating under shock and anger, not out of parental skills.\n\nYou have overplayed your hand, and mucked it up.

If punishments are too harsh and seemingly arbitrary then they don't become effective deterrents. Especially as this is out of character for her- it's not teaching her the consiquences of being unkind it's teaching her any lapse of judgement will be met with extream punishments- next time she has a lapse (and she's 14, she's going to make more bad choices and not always understand why or what the actual affect of them will be) she's not going to fess up or learn anything, all that's going to happen is she's going to need to hide it from you and it will get worse and worse. Do you want a daughter that makes a mistake and comes to you for help fixing it? Or one that digs deeper and deeper till she is in to deep? Because I can tell you where that story ends and it's a summer being molested and not saying anything because you assume you will get in trouble.", "NTA actions have consequences and sometimes the small ones will build up to bigger ones.", "Slight YTA, but only for going overboard in relation to a harmless prank.  Your little ones sound like some toughening up may be in order\u2026\n\nAlso - keep in mind that her behaviors will heighten in extremity as she ages.  If she skips class or sneaks out\u2026are you going to ground her for two years???  If a grounding was in order, no way should it be over a week.", "Soft YTA. I think those would be appropriate had she actually flushed them, but maybe a little excessive for a prank.

What will you do when she does something even more egregious ?  It is much, much too harsh for a normally kind girl who made a very poor decision.", "YTA, I could maybe understand that punishment if she actually flushed the sea monkeys down the toilet but she didn't.", "YTA if they were younger your punishment would probably be justified. And maybe posting it to tik tok goes too far but you stopped that. Taking the phone away is enough.", "ESH because the punishment is so general. You should make her take care of the sea monkeys and stay off TikTok. Temporary grounding is fine too, but you can probably cut down some of the other stipulations", "Soft YTA. I think the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime and that\u2019s the only reason for the YTA. \n\nI like the apology letter. I think it aligns with what the crime was. \n\nI think taking away the phone for a week or two is also a good idea. Lily said she was going to post it onto TikTok. It may be a good idea to take that source of social media away from her. \n\nOP also can\u2019t just delete the app, Lily is 14, she\u2019ll redownload it. \n\nBut I think the grounding with only extracurricular activities for 2 months is too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Our kids are from our previous marriages.\n\nLily's dad is a deadbeat but Mia and Sean's mother is active in their lives.\n\nOnto the story. For context, Mia and Sean for the longest time have always wanted a pet and always beg me and my husband for a dog or a cat. They are total animal lovers and they both want to be vets when they grow up. \n\nUnfortunately getting a pet is not something we can do at the moment. My husband have talked about it a few times and we may consider getting a small pet, such as rats or gerbils, in the future.\n\nFor Christmas, my MIL got Mia and Sean a sea monkeys kit each and they were over the moon and super excited waiting for them to hatch. They opened these gifts on Christmas Eve because my husband's family celebrates it then.\n\nOn Christmas day, while I was at work (the joys of shift work), my husband said Lily poured the contents of the plastic tanks into the toilet and flushed it.

Grounded for 2 months except for school extracurriculars.\n2. No smartphone or allowance for 1 month, and Lily will use my spare Nokia to call or text us or other family members as needed. She can use the family computer if she needs the internet for homework.\n3. Lily has to write a sincere apology letter to Mia and Sean.

These are consequences that are artificial because they're imposed by someone rather than happening naturally but are still logically related to whatever happened.\n\nIn this case, possible logical consequences might be:\n- Removal of TikTok privileges bc she got the idea there\n- Having to \"make it up\" to her siblings in some way\n- Being made to spend time volunteering at the pet store or shelter or vet office to learn more about people's bonds with animals\n\nAnd all kinds of other things that might make sense in the context of her actions.", "Ah, you\u2019re right, sometimes hard to keep track of these threads on my phone", "NTA. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a prank to upset them, it was a prank to upset and exploit them for likes on TikTok. That\u2019s cruel. Taking away her phone if she\u2019s going to use it to be this way is the right move. \n\nAdditionally you\u2019re blending two households, I can\u2019t imagine how hard that is. 2 months seems a bit much but I think you know your daughter better than anyone here and also her reaction and how she behaves will also weigh I am sure. \n\nAnyway, good luck, Reddit hates parents", "NTA.\n\nKids keep using prank to describe horribly traumatizing someone for a tiktok. Not a fan, personally.", "Tiktok likes for traumatising her siblings...Ffs \n\nNTA here, if the shoe was on the other foot and you flushed her phone down the toilet and recorded it for likes.\n\nI think she would be next level pissy", "NTA and it was a cruel prank. If my kid, she\u2019d be deleting her TikTok account. She is too immature to have social media.", "NTA. Hopefully she understands what happened here and why you're taking it seriously. People like your dad, who trivialise and excuse horrible behaviour like this are the reason there are so many selfish, thoughtless and downright cruel adults in the world.", "This forum is undefeated in proving to me that people who play pranks don't know what a prank actually is and are really just trying to excuse the fact they are assholes.\n\nYou however are NTA and you punishments are nowhere near too much. They are related to the offense and send the right message.", "I think it would be a good compromise if OP offered her daughter to speak again over this incident after two weeks and asking if daughter has some insight about her doing or watching TikTok\u2019s with daughter that inspired her to hatch this plan or talking about something that daughter adores questioning her how she would feel if someone would destroy things she likes just for clicks and likes. In the end the punishment could maybe negotiated and reduced", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, it wasn\u2019t a prank - not lighthearted, not funny, no one was laughing. Rather, it caused distress: this was bullying. \n\nSecond - She caused emotional distress so that random strangers on the internet could laugh at little kids.", "YTA\n\nOK, I might be downvoted for that as in some culture grounding for long periods of time is accepted as punishments, but cutting a human being from their friends for that long is abusive. In any circumstances.", "You really are going overboard with the punishment. What she did wasn\u2019t nice but I still think you really went for her jugular.", "Esh, she can't post on tiktok, but you can on reddit? I agree that she needs a lesson in cruelty, but at the end of the day you're her prime example. Are you being kind enough?\nEdited to correct autocorrect. (2x)\n(Stupid autowrong.)", "It's a very diverse platform, actually.", "I think a natural consequence needs to  be related to TikTok/social media. If using the app was inspiration for a mean spirited prank, then clearly she is not capable of handling access. I'd ban that for a while, and then when she gets back on it should be incremental with close parental monitoring.", "I mean it\u2019s kinda true tho I didn\u2019t say nothing about them being lazy. It\u2019s just kinda dumb for people to think it\u2019s traumatizing for them.", "People remember things from when they're as a kid, when it affects them deeply.\n\nI was 6 when I had a dog.. for a little while. My father euthanized it, not allowing it to be trained, because it was \"vicious\". Or when he had me and my siblings stay in the living room because his budgie disappeared. No fault of our own, he found it between boxes in his model train set up.\n\nBoth instances less traumatizing, not for social media, nor did anyone beyond the perpetrator think it was 'ok'.\n\nSo, it can be these two kids will be affected for some time, and maybe like you said, they might be perfectly fine.", "Don\u2019t be the state of Texas, not everything is a capital offense. The punishment is overboard to the point of being ineffective. Apologies to the kids, good consequence. Loss of tik tok privileges, good consequence. 2 month grounding, overboard and will build resentment. \n\nBuilding resentment is a big thing to worry about and I think you already know that. The fact that her father isn\u2019t in the picture, while your stepkids\u2019 mother is had absolutely no bearing on this story or what happened. However you included it anyway. I think you know why this behavior popped up and it isn\u2019t out of nowhere. This is what you need to work on with your daughter. She needs therapy. She needs a safe space to get out her feelings of being abandoned by her father while living with step siblings who haven\u2019t been discarded by either of their parents. You need to start walking the very fine line of disciplining without building resentment, and working with a professional to navigate that line in a way specific to your child is the best way to parent in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m giving you a little y YTA. Mostly because I think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing and I suspect you already know it. There is a bigger dynamic going on here and you need to nip it in the bud before it turns in to major incidents of acting out.", "What are you doing to make her repair the relationship with her siblings? Because she broke it, so she has to fix it. An apology is only words. First, she has to hear and accept her impact. Then the apology. Then the repair work. You can ground her for a million years and it will do nothing to repair what she broke.\n\nESH.", "Clearly, the 2 months grounding is excessive.\n\nAnd as parents there seems to have been a lack of monitoring /restricting of social media for her to have got the idea. That's on you as parents.\n\nIt was a prank in a child's mind that was taken too far with the aim of impressing on social media.\n\nSo in effect a child did a child thing driven by the social media that was clearly the parents \"fault\". The parents need to take their responsibility in this. And adjust the punishment to reflect a child being a child.", "NAH. Valid punishment OP, this behavior needs to be nipped in the bud early. But I also don't think Lily is a true AH. She's a teenager, that's such a tough time, but on top of that she's in a blended home where she probably feels a little upset because Mia and Shaun have their mum in their life while she doesn't have her dad. Teenage logic could tell her they have 3 parents and she only has 1.  \n  \nMaybe while she's grounded some one-on-one time with her could help build a better relationship so she feels the line and south I'm sure you have for her.", "Nope. That is traumatizing. NTA", "She should be punished but two months is too much. You sound like you resent and envy her because your father spoils her and not you. You've gone overboard in your punishment.", "NTA but I think the punishment is too long. Needs to be long enough for them to think about their actions and consequences anything longer just creates resentment and the original point is lost. Especially if this behaviour is out of character for her. As long as she learns from it and understands that a \"joke\" is just bullying if the other person is hurt or upset by it then the purpose of the punisent has been served. \nYour dad sounds like he is the kind of person who would enable her behaviour though.", "NTA. Animal cruelty (or the threat of it) is not funny. Causing distress in another person in order to get upvotes or likes or whatever they call it on Tiktok is not funny. Lily need to understand this. I'm not sure whether grounding is the right way to do this. She needs to develop more empathy.", "NTA. People who do shitty things and say \u201cbut it\u2019s just a prank\u201d need to learn there are consequences for this behaviour", "NTA\nThe prank was cruel and serious consequences are necessary.", "NTA but your dad is for not understanding that you need to put up rules in situations like these. What your daughter did was not okay and lacked empathy towards her siblings. Do not budge on those rules and make sure your dad does not go behind your back and make himself look like the savior.", "Info - what did your MIL get Lily for Christmas?", "I\u2019m curious if Lily was jealous that she didn\u2019t receive the same gift. She might feel left out because MIL didn\u2019t get her the same. It could demonstrate favoritism. I would say her action is more related to family dynamics than tik tok. However, her actions are still not okay.", "NTA- She fake-killed two lil kids' pets. The sea monkeys were a sound idea from you, my other suggestion would be a giant land snail- you require one old fish tank (you can look up dimensions online), or a see-through storage box with holes drilled in the lid, a couple blocks of the cocoa fibre 'earth' (no muck, animal waste etc.), some rocks and bits of wood for interest, then you feed them veg peelings, leftover salad, eggshells or cuttlefish for calcium, and make sure it's kept nice and moist by spraying with one of those water bottles. You can even grow cress in eggshells and put it in for them. They're pretty hardy and two budding vets  who like sea monkeys might really enjoy being able to do all the minimal care they require themselves (a childminder friend of mine has them and it's a fave with her liluns).", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is not a prank, that's abuse", "**NTA**, Lily clearly went over the line. She claimed she \"thought it would be funny\" to defend herself instead of realising that she was out of bounds. This is immature and disrespectful.\n\nIf your dad considered this prank as \"minor\" and had no action been taken, Lily will not face any consequences and may attempt pranks that are far worst than this in the future. Hence, this constitutes disciplinary action.\n\nThough, if she is remorseful for her actions and writes a sincere apology, you could consider reducing the punishment.", "NTA but I think I would try and view this as a learning opportunity. If it truly was out of character for her maybe you could sit down with her and negotiate what you feel would be a suitable consequence for her actions. Bear in mind the main damage that was done was causing distress to the other children could she make it up to them with things that they suggest? I think her repairing the relationship with them is more important than any punishment and knowing that you support her even when she makes a bad decision is much less likely to cause ongoing issues at a pivotal age for her. Call a family meeting with all of you and make a plan. This could be spending time, doing chores or baking for them whatever they decide between them. This will hopefully help the others to move forward too.", "NTA, and please OP- seriously consider her access to Tiktok long term. It is full of toxic shit like this targeted at teenagers. Recording an act of Cruelty for social media seemed ok, because the content she is watching validates that. \n\nShe really needs some help to understand what is so messed up about that.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI'd also talk to your dad about obviously spoiling her. There's the usual \"spoiling\" that grandparents do. The way you worded it, seems like it might be too much and is causing some entitlement issues.\n\nWhat she did was also unbelievably cruel. You said it was out of character for her, so a counselor might be a good idea just to check on her.", "NTA. They\u2019re \u201conly\u201d sea monkeys? I\u2019d be very concerned with her lack of empathy. That\u2019s cruelty right there.", "NTA....god I despise tiktok", "NTA\n\n\\- She faked animal cruelty\n\n\\- She did it intentionally to torment her stepsiblings\n\n\\- She FILMED the entire thing so she could get internet likes.\n\nShe's old enough to know better and old enough to know that bullying people is not allowed.", "I see at least one post on here like this every single day. All teenagers who did major damage or other stupid things because they thought it would be a funny \"prank\" to post on tiktok", "It really seemed for a minute like everyone agreed YouTube pranksters were obnoxious and unfunny, it's a bummer the way TikTok has reignited the genre to inspire a new group of people to be irritating to others.", "That's just it. She doesn't recognize what she did was wrong. She says they're \"only sea monkeys\" and the little siblings are \"oversensitive\". She's not sorry at all and for her to want to hurt her little siblings in the first place is a red flag for what she will become later in life.", "Also just ban TikTok in the house permanently. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities and just seems to incite this kind of cruelty and idiocy.", "I would be worried too, but I can assure you the problem is tik-tok.  As others have said, it is becoming more cruel with these pranks and challenges.  Anymore it seems an outlet for shock media.", "I agree on the paper lol. Make her write about instances of tiktok pranks that are too far and why they are not appropriate bc it seems like otherwise she's getting punished but doesn't understand at all and will not change", "Yeah, they do- and maybe there is nothing behind it- but considering that this is a behavioral shift, and she doesn\u2019t seem to care about these kids\u2019 feelings- I would want to get a better sense of her thought process. 14 is old enough to understand how not okay this was.", "You were raised wrong.", "You're embarrassing yourself.", "Nope, it\u2019s not \u201ckinda true\u201d.  Nothing true about it at all.  You are still an immature 14 year old arsehole."]}
