They are total animal lovers and they both want to be vets when they grow up. \n\nUnfortunately getting a pet is not something we can do at the moment. My husband have talked about it a few times and we may consider getting a small pet, such as rats or gerbils, in the future.\n\nFor Christmas, my MIL got Mia and Sean a sea monkeys kit each and they were over the moon and super excited waiting for them to hatch. They opened these gifts on Christmas Eve because my husband's family celebrates it then.\n\nOn Christmas day, while I was at work (the joys of shift work), my husband said Lily poured the contents of the plastic tanks into the toilet and flushed it. Mia and Sean were heartbroken and wouldn't stop crying.\n\nIt turns out that it was \"a prank\" and Lily was keeping the sea monkeys in another plastic tub in her room. She admitted she recorded Mia and Sean's reactions and was going to post it on tiktok. I made her delete the video. \n\nI honestly cannot comprehend why she'd do something like that, this is so out of character for Lily who's normally a very kind outgoing girl. I've asked her why she did it but she kept saying she just thought it would be funny, and didn't expect Mia and Sean to become so upset. She said they're only sea monkeys anyway and Mia and Sean are oversensitive.\n\nI thought about it for a little while and I decided on consequences.\n\n1. Grounded for 2 months except for school extracurriculars.\n2. No smartphone or allowance for 1 month, and Lily will use my spare Nokia to call or text us or other family members as needed. She can use the family computer if she needs the internet for homework.\n3. Lily has to write a sincere apology letter to Mia and Sean. No video games until it's done.\n\nIt might seem over-the-top but this was a big deal in our household, and even after they got the sea monkeys back, Mia and Sean haven't been quite themselves.\n\nLily obviously wasn't happy about the consequences and is doing a teenage sulk and says I'm being unfair. She texted my dad and complained to him. \n\nMy dad likes to take Lily out on shopping sprees and spoil her, and with her grounded that won't be allowed. He called me and asked what happened. \n\nI explained everything and he said I'm being too harsh on his grandbaby and that what she did was only minor and I'm overreacting. \n\nI told him if he wants to see Lily he's welcome to come over but no spoiling her with gifts like he usually does. He called me a Grinch for grounding my daughter on Christmas and not letting him treat her, then ended the call.", "created_utc": 1672281029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxt2mg/aita_for_grounding_my_daughter_on_christmas_over/", "score": 1593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m assuming Lily thought it would be funny based on what she consumes on the app. \n\nNTA, but maybe monitor her social media uses a little more and choose one (not all three) of those punishments. Just my two cents.", "What she did was not minor. She faked animal cruelty in order to cause psychological damage to *children* who are younger than her, because - *checks notes* - she thought it would be funny??? You are sending a clear message to her that bullying will not be tolerated. NTA.\n\n**Obligatory top comment edit:** Thanks for the upvotes and the award! Let me add a few things \n\n1. I do think the punishment was a little too harsh. I think OP should pick one of the punishments and the apology to her siblings, and ease up on the rest, especially considering she says it's not her daughter's usual behavior. Getting at the root of the issue is more important than punishing.\n\n2. Yes, I know that sea monkeys are just brine shrimp. I stand by my \"animal cruelty\" statement because (a) even a sea monkey is a beloved family member to a young child and (b) the intention was cruelty. If a child steps on an ant, you don't freak out, but if they burn a whole anthill with a magnifying glass, you worry about the child's psyche.", "NTA- she did the wrong thing and should be punished for it. It was a cruel thing to do, especially on Christmas Day. \n\nThe problem is this is a teachable moment and I don\u2019t see anything about her learning that what she sees on TikTok is often staged and not real \u2018pranks.\u2019 She\u2019s overstepped a boundary, but does she understand where the line is and why?", "NTA *but* you should find a way to climb down from the 2 months, it's too much. The loss of phone & letter will be more than sufficient & entirely appropriate - & perhaps a warning about reviewing her use of tiktok (toxic pos for teens) if anything like this happens again.\n\nMaybe make the 2 months conditional based on the quality of her letter? \n\n\nHave to bear in mind you need to leave room for future punishments.", "NTA for giving consequences/punishments but I feel like the ones you gave were disproportionate and disconnected from what she did. \n\n2 months of being grounded? I think taking the phone off her was fair and also make sure to ban usage of social media for the 2 months. It's fair enough that you don't want people spoiling her for a bit whilst she reflects on her poor behaviour. But not going out aside from school for 2 months seems not relevant to what she did. It sounds like this was motivated by tiktok, so just ban use of tiktok and similar apps for a couple of months until she grows up and learns that pranks aren't funny.", "NTA - she's 14 years old, doing something cruel like that to other kids who are younger for a tiktok video is awful. I don't think you're overreacting at all. Furthermore, you're the parent here and it's your decision.", "I don't think you're the AH but as a parent of four (21, 19, 17 & 15) I do think you are being too harsh. Two months grounding is huge in the life of a teen. It's also more likely to cause resentment to the younger step siblings imo, even though they did nothing. We talk a lot about consequences and, with my kids, I find that when they are particularly mean it's often because they have been thoughtless rather than out of malice. A 'put yourself in their shoes' discussion goes a long way. That said, I don't know what consequences I would recommend since I don't know your household, maybe something that involves cheering up the younger kids - like taking them to a local dog park or cat cafe, since they like pets?\n\nGood luck. Parenting teens is tough, and a split family is an extra challenge, I imagine.", "NTA - This is the second sub post this week with a 'prank' and both people stated, \"They (victims) are being  over sensitive...it's just a prank.\" Her actions now have the younger children question feeling safe around her. She completely broke their trust.  Be careful calling her actions 'minor'. It was calculating, cruel, recorded and posted (minors on tiktok).", "This does seem like a pretty extreme punishment. You need to allow yourself room to grow for worse punishments in the future and you've already set the bar way too high.", "NTA \n\nI agree that this was a very serious prank. Maybe she didn't think about it enough before acting on it, but the fact that she planned it out and recorded it says a lot. Obviously she didn't expect the reaction from her siblings or you.\n\nThat being said, I've always believed the punishment should fit the crime. I'm not sure what 2 full months of being grounded will accomplish and it seems too long. \n\nI do agree with no internet or social media. Social media is the reason she came up with the prank, so it fits. She needs to learn that TikTok is not real and things that are encouraged there are often harmful. \n\nI would probably make her write a research paper having to do with the harm TikTok causes, but that's me. She would also need to verbalize why what she did was wrong. I wouldn't allow her to be on TikTok or Instagram at all for a very long time.\n\nDocking her allowance doesn't make sense to me either. \n\nI agree that the younger 2 deserve an apology, but I'm not so sure it would be heartfelt if forced. I would not make her apologize until she has really thought about why what she did was so awful. \n\nA person should learn from their mistakes and also their punishment. Punishment shouldn't be out of anger. If it goes on for too long or doesn't make sense, the learning from it is lost.\n\nYou father needs to be shut down immediately. It's not up to him to decide or judge how you raise or discipline your child. He had his turn with his own kids.", "INFO: What is the point of the list of punishments (none of those are discipline beyond the apology, they are punishments)? What is your goal here? Discipline should be a natural consequence of an action. Taking away a tradition she has with her grandfather and banning gifts from him, excessive grounding, no allowance, no phone etc are not natural consequences of a prank that ultimately led to nothing because the Sea Monkeys were returned and unharmed. The apology is happening and the video was deleted. \n\nWas it incredibly impulsive? Yes. Was it a bad prank? Yes. \n\nI am all for discipline. Given that this is your reaction for a relatively minor incident I would hate to see what your reaction would be to something bigger though.", "ESH.  It was a bad prank but the punishment is excessive. Punishment loses context after a week so it's best to keep it heavy but short.\n\nAlso look into the why since it seems out of character.", "NTA because I think pranks like this are cruel, especially when the intent is to hurt someone else. And she was going to make it public. I agree with your instinct to react pretty strongly. Though I think it's reasonable to consider whether your punishment is leading to its intended effect. A punishment that is too harsh won't really teach her any lessons, but will just teach her to resent you. And it can be a good lesson that if she shows remorse and gives a sincere apology, and understands why what she did was wrong, her punishment could potentially be lessened. So maybe sit down and talk with her about it. Let her show you whether or not she really seems to understand why the prank was wrong. If she seems to be truly apologetic, I think it might be kind to allow her to go shopping with her grandfather.", "NTA.  I think two months is too long, but most of this seems to fit to me. That was a really cruel thing to do to two smaller children, and filming it to get likes is obscene. \n\nI think her desire to get big in TikTok is the real issue. Sticking her with the Nokia might do it, but I\u2019d forbid her from making any TikTok posts at all. She\u2019s proven her judgement is not there yet. Not sure if you can do that without deleting her account, but I\u2019d try to hold that in reserve if necessary. Give her a chance to prove she can keep it. Really point out why this was so harmful - pranks are only funny if EVERYBODY is laughing, including the victim.", "NTA for disciplining your kid- but I think 2 months is a bit much. What concerns me is why she did this in the first place. Does she harbor resentment towards her step siblings? Did she not think it through? Is she often inconsiderate of others? I think 2 weeks to a month is fair- but I would also want to find out what was going on in her head.", "NTA. \n\nI do think your punishment is maybe a tad excessive, but I'm not a child psychologist I don't know what the best way to handle this would be.\n\nAt the same time, what your daughter did was very cruel and you've sent your message loud and clear that bullying isn't going to be tolerated. Your heart's in the right place.\n\nYour dad is an AH for trying to undermine you and overstepping.", "I agree with parts of your punishment and disagree with other parts.\n\nYes - make her write the apology - but also have a bit of discussion with her about the reason the kids were so upset, get her to work through what they were thinking/feeling at that moment THEN address with her a bit about WHY she thought it would be funny, what was she aiming for the other kids to feel and express and why that seemed like it would be a 'funny' reaction to her. Essentially prod into her thought process for coming up with the 'prank'. \n\nI would suggest a complete ban on Tiktok (I have never used it, but I already hate it just from the stories I see about the things people post on there) and an easing of the other restrictions depending on the outcome of the discussion you have with her about her motives. \n\nThe \\*ideal\\* outcome from discussing her motives will be that she actually reflects on what she did, and while she may not have been thinking directly about wanting to hurt the younger kids that there was quite probably something of that motive in it. \n\nPlease follow through from that though, is she jealous of her siblings, if so why, what is it she is jealous of. Does she want more one on one time, does she need to see a therapist, what is going on under the bonnet (hood I guess?) that is making her act in a nasty way to her siblings.\n\nWhile I agree that punishment is needed, if there is an underlying jealousy then the extent of the punishment will only serve to make her feel more negatively to them. \n\nSo... yes have serious consequences for the prank. But don't make them so severe that she will backlash against you and her siblings, and try to work with her to find out what her true motive was. And perhaps look at making sure that she is getting the help and attention she needs from the adults in her life if she is struggling. She is also a teen and that is a awful time to be a person without any additional sources of stress, anxiety or jealousy. \n\nOh.. and last thought, make sure everything is good at school, with friends and extended family. It could be displaced emotion targetted at the siblings but caused by something outside the home.", "NTA.\n\nWhat Lily did was cruel and I you are in the right.\n\nBut...\n\nSea Monkeys?  Seriously????  I remember buying the kit off a comics ad....AND THEY WERE JUST BRINE SHRIMP!!!!  We had a fresh water tank at the time and bought live brine shrimp as a treat for the fish!  SEA MONKEYS ARE A RIP OFF!", "NTA cruelty is not funny, also tik tok is just a cesspool.", "I\u2019m gonna go NTA/bordering on a very very soft Y.T.A.\n\nShe does need to have consequences because what she did was very inconsiderate towards Mia and Sean, but I\u2019d probably cut down the time to losing everything for ~1 month, plus the apology letter, and maybe even adding on agreeing to take care of the sea monkeys for a couple of days. 2 months of nothing but extracurriculars is a little bit harsh for what she thought was a harmless prank\n\nETA: I\u2019d probably sit down with her to discuss her actions and how toxic social media is, especially at a young age, and how seeking the somewhat-instant gratification can be damaging to her relationship to her younger step-siblings and friends/family in general", "NTA. Anybody who triggers their own family and records it to become popular is despicable. She should not have access to social media until she understands how horrifying this behavior is.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised to see so many \u201charmless prank\u201d comments. Causing emotional trauma for young kids so you can record their reaction and post to social media is NOT a harmless prank and the fact that the other two are still feeling pain from it should be evidence enough.\n\nI may have different time lines for how long a punishment would last but TikTok would be off the phone permanently.", "NTA.\nNo smartphone for sure\u2014she was filming this for TikTok, so no more TikTok.\nI personally love the apology letter\u2014we did that when one of our son\u2019s bullied another kid and made him hand deliver it to him at his house\u2014it was pretty effective.\nYour dad will have to spoil her another time. And he should actually be proud that you are not raising her to be a little a$&/h8&e.", "Nta for giving consequences", "NTA\n\nWhat are all these people on about? Harmless prank?? That could have been actually traumatizing to the other kids.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty normal to place different amounts of importance on the lives of different animals, and I will freely admit I would be vastly less upset about sea monkeys getting flushed than a cat getting killed, but A) that\u2019s still really bad and B) it\u2019s likely not everyone, particularly young kids, have developed that stratification of importance that many people have. \n\nThose kids thought they had the only pet they\u2019ve been able to have *murdered* by their sibling, in front of them, while being recorded. That\u2019s fucking traumatic. Finding out after that it was fake does not erase the trauma of that moment or the lingering emotions and memories of thinking that had happened. 14 is more than old enough to understand that. Maybe she didn\u2019t get how bad that was, but she\u2019s certainly old enough to.\n\nSome other comments suggest paying more attention to what she\u2019s consuming on the internet, and I completely agree, so it would make sense to alter her punishment to address the issue more directly, but what you\u2019re doing is in no way cruel or unusual punishment (this sub is full of removing privacy and other horrid punishments, none of which you are doing)", "Nta for being angry but 2 months is too long. \n\nYou can't go back on it now but it further alienates her from the other 2 which sounds like it's the source of the prank.  And stupid tiktok", "NTA\nYou're a parent disciplining their child.\nBut Lily needs to understand *why* she's being punished. She violated her sibling's trust and possessions. Perhaps her punishment isn't entirely fitting her crime. The apology letter helps along the right lines, but the taking of her phone and freedoms is probably the wrong direction. Is there something she could do for Mia and Sean to help reassure them that she still cares about them and is sorry?\n\nIf this is out of character, there may be others influencing her. It's probably come from somewhere online, but unless you find the route cause, she'll just go back to it when she gets her phone back.", "ESH.  That prank was exceptionally cruel to her younger stepsiblings, and your punishment is extreme.  Part of the issue with these pranks is that even adults are doing cruel things to young children to post and get attention online.  These videos are everywhere.  Right now, the flavor of the day is the Grinch videos, with young children reacting by panicking and screaming.  It's definitely your job as a parent to deal with this and show Lily this was cruel and that treating her stepsiblings like this will not be tolerated.  With that being said, natural consequences and making amends often go hand in hand and drive the lesson home.  Being grounded for 2 months is excessive.  Taking the smart phone fits with natural consequences, and so would making her delete her Tik Tok account (my underage kids do not have Tik Tok at all).  You need to have her think of ways she can make amends to her stepsiblings as well.  Whether that's writing letters of apology, or her figuring out something nice to do for/with them as a means of letting them know she is truly sorry for hurting them.  Yes, you do need to take action here, I agree.  But I think what you are doing here is going to backfire on you at some point.", "NTA but way over reaction. You have basically painted yourself into a corner because there\u2019s nothing left to take away and she is more likely to act out because of it.  She\u2019s a teenager in an era where these videos are very popular and I am sure she didn\u2019t realize the long term impact. I would encourage an apology but more than that, there needs to be conversations about how even if it\u2019s funny online, it\u2019s not appropriate to do it without permission from the people your do it to.  I have two teenagers and I know that it\u2019s very easy to get caught up in the drama and attention of online media and not fully understand the consequences.", "NTA \n\nLily\u2019s prank was cruel and so the punishment is appropriate", "YTA. \nYou went overboard. She's going to hate the kids more than ever now, and you've shown her she should be extra extra sneaky no matter what because you'll go full on apeshit no matter what.", "YTA for the overkill. Which is what this is. You went overboard with the grounding and you know it. Two weeks to a month with no allowance or electronics would've been more than sufficient.", "I'm going with a slight YTA. Your punishment feels more fitting for her actually flushing the sea monkeys. It's a bit too severe for the equivalent of teaching a dog to play dead and then covering it in fake blood. I get that it was mean but it wasn't cruel.\n\nYour 14 year old needs a lesson on empathy and an explanation that this prank went too far. And that good people don't record others hurting for internet points. But the punishment you've laid out is just not good. You are way too focused on making her feel bad instead of making her understand why what she did was mean. You're punishing her because you're mad, not to help her learn. Writing a letter is not going to work out like you think. She's gonna make it generic \"What do they want me to say?\" You'd be better getting a workbook on empathy or a game like [this](https://www.childtherapytoys.com/products/the-empathy-card-game?variant=28541101894&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&wi=off&gclid=CjwKCAiA76-dBhByEiwAA0_s9bxGhwuXmvvIyIJaZySQFaZGGM1d0I6uupJBg8MpMsKBGwpAeGWHohoCyKYQAvD_BwE).\n\n\nBetter punishment idea: Block TikTok for 3-6 months. She can have other social media, but not TikTok. She hurt her siblings to post it on TikTok, well now she can't use TikTok at all. Punishment fits the crime, you still get an extended punishment period, but she isn't just sulking around grumping and blaming you for making her life terrible. (You can still do like a week of something harsher but this is more fitting to what was done.)", "That's unfortunate, being grounded on Christmas.\n\nHowever, playing a practical joke like that on small children for the sake of some internet clout is beyond disgusting, and it's only too fair that she be taught a valuable lesson on how to conduct herself in the future.\n\nNTA.", "nta, a little harsh maybe but nta. I thik as we become more consumed with our own consumerism and smartphones and social media, we sometimes forget about having empathy for others. I think the old days were better at teaching it, for example, fall off your bike skin your knees and then a few weeks later another kid you know does it, I think you were more likely to go \"oh ouch\" at the very least. But now that social media has allowed us to be rulers of our own little electronic digital domains we have forgotten about other people.", "NTA for grounding her, but 2 months grounding is pretty extreme. I feel like the punishment should fit the crime, like 2 months no TT.", "NTA -", "NTA but I do think the grounding is excessive and will probably end up being more of a punishment for the rest of the family as she sulks around.

In particular doing it, to film her siblings genuine and vulnerable reactions, to show the world. \n\nThe opinion of strangers was more important than the hurt she caused in the process.\n\nNow that sounds harsh.

It\u2019s had an impact. \n\nAnd it seems like Lily was dismissive of the pets and her siblings feelings when called out for it. \n\nI\u2019m not the parent of a teen. I was also never grounded growing up. 2 months sounds harsh to me but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s standard in your house (or anyone else\u2019s for that matter) \n\nIf you sit down with Lily, explain why it was serious, and tell her she needs to sincerely apologise and the other consequences, and she does what she needs to do, maybe consider reducing the grounding", "INFO 2 months is way too long, but you know that.

If punishments are too harsh and seemingly arbitrary then they don't become effective deterrents.

Do you want a daughter that makes a mistake and comes to you for help fixing it? Or one that digs deeper and deeper till she is in to deep?

If it truly was out of character for her maybe you could sit down with her and negotiate what you feel would be a suitable consequence for her actions. Bear in mind the main damage that was done was causing distress to the other children could she make it up to them with things that they suggest? I think her repairing the relationship with them is more important than any punishment and knowing that you support her even when she makes a bad decision is much less likely to cause ongoing issues at a pivotal age for her.

When my sons were that age I would ask them to come up with what they thought was a reasonable consequence and then  my husband and I would make a decision.

Other posts have done a great job talking about the punishment vs. what actually happened (no harm to living creatures).

Then she gets left out of a \u201csibling present\u201d and punished harshly for acting out. She\u2019s 14 and of course she was filming it- it\u2019s the equivalent of a diary nowadays. This is a turbulent time for young women and it\u2019s only going to get harder. I might suggest counseling/family bonding/building as it\u2019s going to be harder on Lily: she was old enough to clearly remember before your husband and is very aware of her \u201cdeadbeat\u201d father. The younger two are likely barely aware of anything other than loving support from a lot of adults in their lives. However, this is a great opportunity to admit to your 14yo that you, as an adult, sometimes get things wrong.

She doesn\u2019t sound ready for a real smartphone at all if this is what she\u2019s learning on it. \nI\u2019m a mom of five and the oldest three are teens now. If she doesn\u2019t lose video game access for the duration of her grounding I don\u2019t think it will make much of an impact. She\u2019ll lose going some places, but she\u2019ll still have that favorite pass time to fall back on. Media inspired this so her media consumption needs to be strongly curtailed until she starts showing more maturity in how she uses it. Grounded from activities and video games for two months, smartphone exchanged for a locked down phone for at least 6-12 months, social media accounts deleted, computer use only with parental supervision, and writing a sincere apology. What she did was incredibly hurtful to those kids and she needs to face some real consequences for hurting them in order to make herself more popular online. The impact of her \u201cprank\u201d is longer reaching for her siblings and her consequences should be much further reaching in her life too.

It is in actually WEIGHING or factoring in the known consequences compared with the immediate personal benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s why teens will be more likely to not wear seatbelts, or carry an epipen their life literally depends on, or jump off high things. They understand the potential consequences. They are very real. They just have a more difficult time weighing those POTENTIAL consequences appropriately in the balance compared with the immediate, personal, guaranteed benefit of looking cool / not looking uncool / having fun. It\u2019s what results in risk-taking behaviour from someone at an age where you would expect they would know better. Because they do know better. They just have difficulty applying it. \n\nShe knew her siblings would be incredibly upset. She knew there was a possibility she would get in trouble or that it would backfire.

Serious consequences will have an impact. I think OP went overboard with the length and number.

OP literally specified that siblings are still not acting themselves. \n\nYou have to factor in this was not just a random prank. It was on Christmas, with the present they were most excited about, and it was a total violation from someone they love and trust who has never done anything like this to them before. The emotional fallout is significant - for everyone involved. \n\nAnd yes, because she didn\u2019t fully think about the consequences for her before she did it, there is emotional fallout for the 14 year old as well. But that\u2019s good, and it\u2019s not a reason for there not to be consequences. It doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t mean it or didn\u2019t do something wrong just because she genuinely feels bad about it now. \n\nShe is a good kid that got caught up in something insidious and she\u2019s not the first teen to do so.

Friend drama, a teacher she hates, teasing at school, etc. And that needs to be talked about. Talk about how its mean to take it out on others and it doesn't change the bad things. Give her the skills to cope with her feelings. Get her in with a therapist maybe. Kid drama may feel silly to an adult, but its HUGE to a kid in that moment.

Which you severely punished her for. Do you want your daughter to learn how to lie to you and hide things from you? Because this is how it starts.

Mia and Sean being upset for a window of time doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re traumatized for life and that the sea monkeys are not back in their possession. Kids at that age have to learn resilience. What happened to them wasn\u2019t fun and wasn\u2019t nice, but they do need to learn how to \u201cget over this\u201d and not be taught by the adults in the household that it\u2019s appropriate for them to sit and fester in their negative feelings. That is also how you set the stage for life-long battles. Don\u2019t teach children to have disproportionate responses to their hurt feelings. Teach them how to cope and manage their feelings. Teach them how to confront their hurt and those who hurt them and to take their agency in their own hands. Nobody seems to have had a talk with these two that yes what happened to them wasn\u2019t nice and wasn\u2019t okay, but they should focus now on the fact that they have their pets back safe and sound and to enjoy the time they have with their new pets. You could instead have turned the focus on the three of them learning how to properly take care of these animals together, learning more about these actual animals and their biology, and turning this all into something positive that could have also included Lily but instead you decided to go scorched earth with your own daughter for no good reason. Also, these two kids are young, has anybody even bothered to explain to them that sea monkeys can live for years if they\u2019re actually taken care of? Are they aware that they have a commitment on their hands now? If we\u2019re going to talk animal cruelty let\u2019s talk about how quickly \u201cnon-traditional\u201d pets die in the hands of children who claim they are such massive animal lovers. If they kill off those creatures before they reach the end of their nature life span as a colony are you going to punish them to the same extent you\u2019ve punished Lily, who has not actually caused harm to these animals? If the punishment has to do with perceived animal cruelty, how harsh are you going to be when actual animal cruelty takes place?\n\n>Lily obviously wasn't happy about the consequences and is doing a teenage sulk and says I'm being unfair.

You\u2019re on a fast track to teaching all of them that whenever an incident or conflict occurs, Lily is going to be singled out of the support system and empathy is not reserved for Lily the way that it is for the rest of the family.\n\n>I'm being too harsh on his grandbaby and that what she did was only minor and I'm overreacting.  \n>  \n>he's welcome to come over but no spoiling her with gifts like he usually does.

Anything less is a failure in taking responsibility (on the parents part).", "Public as in online. She took video intending to post it on TikTok. I'm guessing it would be going viral around the kids' school in a day, max.", "Idk. I follow a vet and a couple of others that are purely posting educational content like how to advocate for your pets health, common training mistakes etc. \n\nBut unfortunately, social media in general has just encouraged popularity of bullying and vile behavior as being funny when it\u2019s not.

A lot of parents now are trying to combine punishments with a more educational lens than simply \"You did this so now you cant have that\".

Instead of prohibiting her electronics for 1 month, make the use of tiktok, twitter, facebook, discord, roblox and reddit prohibited until she is 21. 3 is perfect, she needs to heavily understand what she did to her siblings.

After most of us had moved out she got a cat and she instantly regretted every previous pet we'd ever had. The goldfish was the only one easier to care for than a cat, and that's only because in retrospect we definitely did a terrible job (had 2 fish in one  5 gallon tank, and changed the water only when it got cloudy, which I now know is awful).", "NTA what she did wasn\u2019t right glad you\u2019re doing the best job to maintain a new household", "NTA\n\nLately, I'm seeing way too many teenagers doing horrible pranks for the sake of posting it to TikTok.

Honestly, social media is part of why I\u2019ve decided not to have kids. I just don\u2019t want to deal with the cyber bullying, the pranks, and the influencers. My little 11 year old niece\u2019s \u201cHalloween\u201d costume this year was dressing up in a sexy witch outfit one of the Kardashian\u2019s wore the previous year.
