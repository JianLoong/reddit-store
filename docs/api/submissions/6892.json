During this time we were traveling along a main road when we spotted an ambulance wanting to turn right into a side street (we drive on the left in my country so the ambulance has the cross the intersection). Once we spotted the ambulance we stopped to give way when a young girl ran into the back of my car. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a huge crash but we pulled to the side of the road to asses the damage. As soon as I stepped out of the car she started to yell as us and asked why we stopped in the middle of the road. I then explained we stopped to give way to the ambulance as we were doing the right thing and giving way. She then yelled at us saying that the ambulance didn\u2019t have its sirens or lights on so we don\u2019t have to give way. I was sure that the rule was give way regardless but then the ambulance driver pulled up to check up on us since they witnessed the crash and said that we did not have to give way but the young lady was still at fault since she hit us. \n\nWe ended up exchanging insurance details and after she calmed down she checked if we were alright and told me what information and details to collect as this was my first car accident. We made it home with a dent in our rear bumper and let the family know what happened. My children are telling me that I should claim that I\u2019m at fault since I stopped unexpectedly but I don\u2019t think I should since she should have kept enough of a distance behind incase I needed to make an emergency stop and she was the one that ran into me, I simply thought I was doing the right thing by giving the ambulance right of way. \n\nSo AITA for not claiming I\u2019m at fault?", "created_utc": 1673268665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107dn95/aita_for_not_claiming_im_at_fault_after_a_girl/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she hit you, she was probably driving faster than she was supposed to", "NTA. Except in situations of illegal \"brake checks\" the person running into the back of another car is at fault.", "NTA you\u2019re not at fault as she hit you but it is true that you do not need to give way to ambulances if the don\u2019t have their lights and/or sirens on.", "NTA. She hit you, irrespective of what you did. Why was she following that close??", "NTA. What if it were an animal on the road or a child or any other scenario where you stop abruptly? If she was following too close and not giving herself reaction time, it's on her. People like to follow right on your ass then get mad when you stop and they hit you. Yeah, you didn't have to give the ambulance right of way, but she hit you so she's at fault.", "NTA. She was at fault for hitting you. Recently I was making a turn when a car on that road made an illegal U- turn, causing me to slam on the brakes. The girl behind me slammed right into me because she was going too fast and only looked at the green light, not my car (she admitted that to me). She was ticketed and her insurance had to pay for my repairs. Unfortunately, the illegal U-turn car sped off immediately or they would hold some culpability.\n\nYou might want to grab a copy of your country\u2019s rules of the road and refresh your memory from time to time, though.", "In my country (Ireland) if you crash into the back of a car in front of you you are automatically at fault regardless of the circumstances. She should have been far enough behind you to be able to stop safely, even if you braked suddenly. NTA", "NTA.  It's silly to think that you are responsible for an accident caused by a person who drove her/his car into yours.  You can't avoid an accident that occurs from the rear.   The person in the rear is completely responsible for accident avoidance.", "NTA. Unless your country has some funky laws then if you run into a stopped vehicle you are to blame.

You shouldn\u2019t have randomly stopped in the middle of the street for an ambulance without lights and sirens. She shouldn\u2019t have hit you.

Never admit responsibility for a vehicle accident. The police, insurance companies and courts exist to determine who\u2019s at fault.", "NTA.  \n\nIn most cases,  rear-end accidents are considered the fault of the person in the back.   The logic is that if the driver can't stop in time to prevent the accident,  they are driving to close to the car in front of them and thus are at fault. It doesn't matter why the person in front stopped. The person in the back can see the car ahead of them, and if they are following the law, which dictates how far back the driver should be driving, then they will not rear end the car in the front.", "NTA and you aren't at fault. Rear-end collisions are always the fault of the driver behind, because it's expected that any person driving could need to make an emergency stop for a multitude of reasons - a child ran into the street, wheel blew out, engine failure, etc. In any of these cases, the person following should have left enough space to stop in a moment's notice without hitting the car in front of them. Failure to do so is a safety breach on their part.\n\nJust imagine if it *had* been a child running into the street, and the car stopped in time - but the one behind them didn't, and rammed the front car over the kid. Horrifying to think about, but it's for that exact reason that this crash wasn't your fault.", "ESH. Depending on where you are, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s fault either of you say it is-fault will be determined by insurance companies. If you both file a claim, insurance companies will work it out determine fault or percentage of fault. (And it would probably be both of y\u2019all\u2019s fault). Such a non issue. Neither of y\u2019all can determine this. Or just fix your own cars and it still won\u2019t matter.", "NTA... you are supposed to keep a safe distance from the car in front of you.  What if a child or animal ran in front of you?  Certainly, you should say you stopped for an ambulance.  The car that rear ends someone is always at fault.   Your insurance company will determine if you are at fault and would refuse the claim no matter what you say.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you have to give way for an ambulance with no sirens but in America it\u2019s a rule of thumb (don\u2019t think it\u2019s an actual law) to travel at least two car widths behind someone in case of a sudden stop", " NTA. The girl was following too close and that is always the losing side in traffic court.", "Generally it is the fault of the driver who rear ends someone but where did the idea that you yield to emergency vehicles that don\u2019t have lights or sirens on come from? That is asinine and really unsafe.  There\u2019s a reason they have lights & sirens- to inform other drivers when you need to get out of their way.", "Fun fact for Americans(I am aware this is not US): you cannot actually claim fault. So bound up in process that a rear end is never going to be your fault unless you were brake checking AND they can prove it with film.", "NTA....never admit fault during an accident. Get a police report and let insurance deal with it. Depending on the state whomever rear ends may be automatically at fault, even though you a) should not have stopped b) do not seem to have pulled over to stop.", "NTA \n\n I\u2019m sure tailgating is illegal there as well.", "NTA. But holy crap, learn the road rules. You may not legally be at fault, but *you absolutely caused that accident*.\n\nI feel awful for the poor person who ran up the back of the random stopped in the middle of the road for no reason.", "ESH she should have had more distance but stopping without proper reason is not great driving either and is putting others at risk.", "Esh. Quit obstructing the flow of traffic trying to be \"nice\" and just drive like a normal person and obey normal traffic laws. Sounds like you may have slammed on your brakes quite suddenly. Obviously not at fault in the accident, but your lack of knowledge over basic traffic laws makes you a danger to others.\n\nDoesn't matter if you admit fault. Your claim adjuster decides fault based on traffic laws. You can't just say you're at fault, and make it true.", "Info: did you slow down before you stopped or did you just push the breaks and suddenly come to a stop?", "Not at fault but YTA in my opinion.
