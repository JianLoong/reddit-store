Where you can go for breakfast (or offer to cook yourself if you can do things like waffles) lunch, parks for your kiddo to play, dinner for the night. She doesn't have to do a DAMN thing in the kitchen that day. Also do things for your daughter like pack her activity bag or diaper bag (you didn't mention how old kiddo was). Or get the kiddo ready to go out the door while mom is doing makeup! \n\nOR if she wants the house to herself then do chores in the morning like the dishes - make those countertops and sink sparkle  - YOU get your daughter up, fed, dressed and have a Daddy daughter lunch date! Be out of the house till like 2 - bring Mom back her favorite coffee/drink. \n\nThen in the afternoon arrange for the parent or trusted babysitter is there & ready so you can take your wife out to dinner for date night. YOU choose three restaurants you know you both like and let her choose which one.

Isolation can mess with you.\n\nI do think OP is NTA, but it isn\u2019t really a useful lens for this situation.  I\u2019m glad OP seems to want to work to improve things with his wife rather than just decide that since he\u2019s \u201cright\u201d he doesn\u2019t need to change anything.", "I think you\u2019re the one with the reading comprehension issue. He\u2019s doing all of that. Like I said, he signed her up for Paint and Sip and has suggested other things. I feel like the only way he could go further is to actually plan her days for her\n\nEta: also where did you get that I said \u201cdon\u2019t be caring\u201d? Are you just making stuff up? Or is this more evidence of that reading comprehension issue?", "Would be ideal; not that I don\u2019t agree with you. But come on", "Seems like said friend was wife\u2019s only outlet.\n\nBut agreed, OP doesn\u2019t need to be \u201cright\u201d, OP doesn\u2019t need to plan his wife\u2019s hobbies, but OP needs to make sure to distract daughter so wife can leave the house without being guilted.", "Sorry reality exists.", "Introspections allows for change here. It\u2019s not easy. But nonetheless\u2026 come on.\n\nIt\u2019s more about the gendered socializations than anything, fyi\n\nYou\u2019re saying that good parenthood means prioritizing yourself. NO SHIT. That\u2019s what having the introspection to do this\u201d means\u2026 are you okay? And you blocked me lol. Cool hon. Be well.", "You just said the equivalent of \"war is dumb, why can't people just exist peacefully\"\n\nBecause society, as a whole, doesn't exist on the best of intentions. Reality is way more complex than common sense allows.", "Nta. If she wants time to herself, she simply just needs to make plans.", "NTA. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe Hey pokebuddy!", "YTA\n\nDoes she get any income so she can organise a day out?\n\nWhy cant you take your daughter on the Pokemon trips", "NTA but maybe phrasing could be improved. My mom went through something similar when she was becoming an empty nester. The kids had stuff going on, my dad had hobbies, my mom was stuck with an identity crisis. \n\nYour wife may have lost who she was before she became wife and mother. She may want to step away from sahm life but feel guilty or not even know what to do if she were to go out for an hour for herself. If she has friends, some moms don't have friends, I would enlist their help on finding something to do. I would also maybe find things that might interest her and take the lead on planning something just for her.", "YTA\n\nOne night a month for couple time? That's nowhere close enough to what's needed to sustain a relationship. Try including her and/or your child for family Pokemon Go. Yikes.", "NTA\n\nThis is pretty common as a mother.  We set ourselves aside to be \u201cmom\u201d and lose ourselves for many years.\n\nThis isn\u2019t something you can solve for her.  She will hit 40 and suddenly go \u201cwho TF am I?\u201d and then your life will get interesting .", "NTA but maybe she doesn\u2019t have many friends? i feel for SAH moms. they can become isolated. maybe you should tell her to invite her girls over and you\u2019ll barbecue for them or really make her feel like you want to help out with her plans. she may have anxiety about going off and doing things with out you, so integrating yourself in a small way may make her more comfortable until she\u2019s able to go out and do stuff on her own.", "NTA - She needs to figure this out for herself.", "NTA, but maybe you need to make some plans WITH her.", "Yeah that's unhealthy and makes everyone else uncomfortable too. Hate that shit", "Seriously. Can you imagine the responses if the genders were flipped?", "May I ask if all the stories are about women in a marriage/ relationship and dealing with family or are there any relatable stories for us middle aged single women?", "Something I haven't seen people mention. I'm a homebody and my wife seems to not understand that trying to spend some me time at home means I need a her to manage the kids and such. She goes out frequently and gets her time to her self. She often misses the fact that the time I want to spend with myself or time to relax is at home. Sometimes it's me playing video games or watching movies with one or all of my kids, sometimes it's chilling in my bed reading. But she never sees that as my equivalent of her outings, so it's was a constant stream of \"hey honey could you do x real quick\" or asking for help on something extremely trivial just so she can try and hide the fact that she wanted to ask me about something else and wanted my undivided attention for it.   \n\n\nIt took me time to figure out how to communicate that the time I set for things is my time to decompress, spend quality time with the kids, etc. It took her time to realize that just because I am home doesn't mean I should drop anything I'm doing because I'm available to help. More specifically, expecting me to help watch the baby when I am trying to play a game or watch a movie with my older kids.   \n\n\nI mention this, because if she's a homebody to, it can be hard to separate their personal time from their usual home responsibly time.", "Yes the best! An empty house is such a luxury sometimes when it comes to recharging batteries.", "Ive been a laying since release and honestly, majority of the hardcore players are middle aged women. It can take a while but raiding has seriously increase our friends in our immediate area and its pretty great to see everyone on Wednesdays for raiding"]}
