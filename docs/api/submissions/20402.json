Where you can go for breakfast (or offer to cook yourself if you can do things like waffles) lunch, parks for your kiddo to play, dinner for the night.

The kid goes to school. Assuming wherever they live has similar timings to schools as my country, that's at least an 8 hour time period 5 days a week at which she can go do stuff. The daughter can't beg to come along if she's at school.\n\n>he can\u2019t distract the daughter while the wife goes off to something of her choosing\n\nIf you have read the post, you would see that he did offer to do that.
