Have a discussion with her and try to get to the root cause of her feelings. Maybe she feels like you aren't valuing her as a romantic partner the way you did before your daughter was in the picture, and just feels like a nanny & a maid.\n\nIf you don't already go out as a couple on a regular basis, then I suggest you start. You prioritize taking time for yourself, which you should, it makes sense to prioritize taking time as a couple.", "NTA.  You aren\u2019t a cruise director.

She can, all she wants.", "Is this about you both going out together as a couple?\n\nIf it's not then NTA\n\nEven in a relationship people do need their own time and  pursue their hobbies /games etc. Once a month is not a big deal. \n\nI guess she is sort of very dependent on you(i couldn't really find an appropriate word). Being a stay at home mom' can be difficult sometimes, does she have friends with whom she can hang out?\n\nYou just need to take her out yourself or REALLY encourage her to go out and have some time for herself.", "You wife loves being a martyr it's absolutely classic behaviour.

But then she still complains. \n\nWhat I would recommend is that you book her a spa day, give her the car you share, and make her leave the house. Then you have a dad and kid day where you make lunch, watch movies, play games, etc.", "NTA. Your wife needs to get a hobby instead of nagging at you for having one.

Relationships are built on communication and fulfilling each others needs. I think what she is telling you is that she needs your help planning some personal time. Young mothers often feel extreme guilt when they leave their children especially for more than an afternoon or other short time span. Maybe plan a spa trip for her and her friend/sister/etc. I don't know what she likes to do but I do know that she's asking you for help in an unproductive way.", "Info - has she made plans in the past and had to withdraw because of a scheduling conflict on your end?

It sounds like the sort of thing where there might be sometimes you can include your daughter, giving your wife some alone time, even if she uses that time to stay at home and read a book or watch a show. It may be wise to try and setup opportunities for your wife to have some alone time, even if she isn\u2019t \u201cgoing out\u201d. Being a SAHM is hard and maybe she isn\u2019t feeling supported? Talk to her about it, a relationship without honest communication is going to be hard.", "No judgement yet.\n\nBut I hope to assume you tell your wife beforehand of any plans. While it\u2019s technically not your responsibility to plan for her events, because she is a a grown adult woman, you can definitely still plan for her once or twice every now and then. She should be responsible for her own events and plans though.", "Info : do you guys go out as a couple ? \n\nWhat happens if she wants to make plans when you go play your little games ?\n\nHow old are your kids ?", "ESH - it sounds like your wife is depressed given the lack of any real activity or interaction with the world. You should continue playing your game but also consider planning events the both of you can do together with a third party watching your daughter or bring the child with you. It\u2019s easy to get stuck in the rut of stay at home parenting, assist her in getting out of it. That said, she\u2019s still responsible for her own happiness and should be seeking it", "You said she's 6, why not just take her with you? Going out with dad to play Pokemon is like a kid's dream.\n\nYou get to play, mom gets kid free time. Sounds like a win-win to the utmost degree.", "YTA\n\nYou realize you are one of two parents, correct? Your wife should not have to ask you to \"watch\" your child. \n\nYou seem to make a lot of time and plans for yourself that does not include your family. Why not plan to take your child with you to one of your events or even take them on a special outing with just you once a week? \n\nThat would free up time for your wife to do what she wants and causes you to be more involved as a parent.", "You're kidding, right? YTA. She shouldn't even have to ask you to get a yes or no answer you should offer to watch your child. Sometimes you need to take the whole family out and sometimes get a babysitter and take your wife out. What you just described was being selfish and inconsiderate.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s not about making plans for her as you said. You should take responsibility and offer to take the child. You\u2019re not \u201cwatching\u201d your child, it\u2019s called parenting.", "YTA. You basically told her that it\u2019s her fault she doesn\u2019t have a life of her own and that\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re overlooking the fact that every day you go to work and get to experience the world outside the door walls of your home.  Because of that it\u2019s really easy for you to reconnect with who you were and the things you liked to do before you became a husband and father. Your wife doesn\u2019t get to do that so you and her daughter have become her entire identity. As her husband, you need to help her with that. Suggest places for her to check out or ask her about her friends you haven\u2019t heard her mention in a while. Help her remember who she was before she became a wife and a mom and you\u2019ll begin to see her make her own plans.", "YTA\n\nIt's not \"watching\" your child - it's parenting.

Take Charge", "YTA because you clearly didn't see the part where shes constantly trying to make plans together when possible... she doesn't want to be alone on trips she wants to attend with her family. She is pointing out how it's unfair how much free time you have compared to her. She shouldn't have to ask you to watch your own child.

Not that it's a bad one or red flag worthy.  Mom may not see that she is allowed to make plans or even trusts dad to handle things while she's gone.  In my relationships I've seen both.

She's got SAHM burnout.  Her brain is going to struggle to pull out of that mindset.  \n\nWhat you need to do is sit down with her and set a routine schedule where she gets downtime.  If she wants to go to her friends and your daughter tries to tag along, you need to reinforce that this is Mom's time to unwind and have an activity ready for her to do together or redirect her.  Maybe call it \"Daddy/Daughter Night\" and have an ongoing project/activity that you two do together, so that mom is off the hook.  \n\nThe key factor is that is your time already scheduled into the calendar on a routine basis that is you being the primary parent in that time block.

I see where he says he has never told her no and tells her \"tell me if you want to go out\" but not that he is proactive about doing things with her or saying \"hey hon, go out with your friends on Saturday night and I'll stay here with the baby.\" She may be feeling some mom guilt if she just decides she wants to go out and tells her husband to stay home.", "What does your wife do? Not being funny, just genuinely want to know what her share is compared to yours.", "Also recommend at the beginning just putting the time on the calendar as a standing event until she's good advocating for herself. \n\nEx, on pokemon go event days, she's blocked out 9-1 where you're 100% watching the kids.
