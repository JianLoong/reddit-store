Or why doesn\u2019t he ever think of doing something with me?\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe you do. But if you don\u2019t, try putting something on the calendar every month just for the two of you. And you make plans for someone to watch the kids. Don\u2019t say, Hey if you can find someone to watch the kids, we,could go \u2026.", "NAH\n\n\nShe knows on some level that she needs a break, but is probably not accustomed to asking or even thinking of something adult to do.\n\nCould you surprise her with say a spa day or something you know she'd like? Sure why not.\n\nI'm not saying it's your fault by any means as I think this is a common theme among couples, especially when kids are involved, and one is a SAH parent. I'm simply suggesting if she's burned out and can't bring herself to make plans of her own you COULD take the initiative to help her get a break.", "At first I was leaning towards Y T A then I read the last paragraph. Everyone is allowed a hobby. \n\nMy partner is a bit like this, it's unfair when I make plans, which I don't do very often, and she refuses to make plans of her own. She doesn't want to do anything but doesn't want me to do anything either. It can be a little suffocating. \n\nI can relate to this. You're not stopping your wife from doing anything and are in fact actively encouraging. Just because she doesn't make plans doesn't mean you can't.\n\nWe may have different interests but each to their own. \n\nNTA", "OP has said that outside of full time work, he does majority of household chores, all cooking and cleaning apart from some dishes occasionally. He wakes up with their child and takes her to school, and trades off on bedtime routine. So, when the child is at school, the wife doesn\u2019t have any chores. At this point, I\u2019m not sure what the wife needs to relax from. This is not equal.", "> You may have to show a bit of leadership here, because a SAHM she may not be used to asking for a break.\n\nAs the SAHM in our marriage, I feel this.\n\nI feel horrible when I ask to go out somewhere alone, because all day I've been alone... doing chores in service of others. Always having one ear open for my kids needing an emergency pick up, planning for tomorrow/next week/the summer, \"oh I should also do this while I'm out.\"\n\nI describe it as \"doing nothing and everything\".", "How could the husband possibly suck here. He\u2019s made the offer. She\u2019s a big girl. He goes out 1 weekend day a month for 3 hours. She has 7 other weekend days she could plan something. If she needs help planning then she should ask for help planning. Not guilt trip the guy for making sure he has personal time.", "What? No. She\u2019s a grown ass adult. If she wants a spa day, she can schedule a spa day.", "I don't like ruling OP as an AH because of what we might \"think\" his wife is trying to say. Being in a relationship requires communication and it's really not OP's responsibility to try to read her mind, even if she is a new mother. He's offered her the time, she hasn't taken the offer. Would it be the polite/thoughtful thing to do to help her plan some me-time? Sure. But I don't think OP is an AH for doing his due diligence and getting nothing in response.", "These are great points. I\u2019m going to be trying to help her get out more and hopefully after a while she won\u2019t need my help to do it.", "I\u2019m not saying SAHM\u2019s don\u2019t work damn hard because they do and should be applauded for that. Not everyone is equipped to handle that workload. But that genuinely doesn\u2019t sound like the case here. OP does all chores and cooking on top of full time job. He takes daughter to school and trades off on bedtimes. Wife can lie in, then has time to herself during school hours Monday to Friday. It\u2019s only holidays where she is required to be hands on all day. \n\nOP believes it is possible there is some element of depression involved. This rings true, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be overload of work at this time.", "How does the husband suck? Does majority of cleaning, cooking, getting daughter ready and to school. Half the bedtime routine. WTF is the wife doing here? She has 6 hours everyday when kid is at school and husband is home working to have time to herself", "Really good points that I\u2019m goi g to give a shot. \ud83d\udc4d", "I am definitely guilty of using that phrase when we have discussed this issue. Going to be working on some changes instead of doing the same loop.", "It\u2019s not an issue where she needs to ask. I have told her repeatedly to give me a time and date she is doing something and I will have no problems taking care of our daughter. The issue is she won\u2019t make plans but gets mad that I do.", "please go back and read OP's comments. I think you'll change your mind. Also she is a SAHM but her kid is 6 years old, which means she is in school most of the time during the day.", "I have consistently advocated for her to do these kind of activities but she won\u2019t take the initiative to plan them. I am going to start making plans for her in hopes she will break out of her habits that are making her have anxiety.", "Funny enough I actually paid for her and my mother in law to exactly that a few weeks back. They did some really cool black light paintings.", "The fact that you would write this shows you either don\u2019t have kids or don\u2019t parent them. Household chores and parenting are not the same. Presumably while he is cleaning she is teaching the kid things, feeding them, and parenting them. It is equal. She literally won\u2019t even take any time to herself. That\u2019s the point of the post.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a lot of emotional labour that can go unnoticed", "Since your Pok\u00e9mon Go sessions are at a pretty regular time, maybe you can come up with a similar 3 hour block that\u2019s specifically designated for your wife to go do something? Even if that\u2019s doing something at home.", "Yep. Find a nice babysitter or family member and take your wifey out. \ud83d\udc95", "Um, so.....  OBVIOUSLY he should read her mind and know exactly how she thinks and feels!", "Because his wife is clearly upset and struggling with something and he just kinda threw up his hands and shrugged. Being a good partner is about a lot more than the mere minimum. Trying saying to your spouse \"you're a grown up, you figure it out\" and see how well that goes for you. Let alone the obvious fact that humans are complex creatures who rarely understand their own feelings and motivations.", "They've entered into a partnership where he likely vowed to hold her happiness dear to him. At least in his responses it sounds like he's going to put some thought and effort into helping her. What is is with these \"I am an island\" responses where you lack the basic empathy to care about another person. How about he recognize she's struggling and does something kind to help her because he loves her?", "I should've said encourage her to pursue a hobby, but some women are still being raised with the idea that the only thing they're good for is to be a doormat for the man of the house. Even when we know there's something wrong with that, we have a  hard time finding ourselves and believing it's OK to do our own thing.", "He's creating the opportunity for you to express yourself and that is a thoughtful thing.", "good on you. my suggestion for a starting point is \u201cwhat do you need in order for to make it possible? what is not working now? what can WE do to make it work?\u201d", "Did she enjoy the evening? Maybe she might like doing a weekly painting class.", "Also, she may not want to go out, she might prefer to be home but without kids. Ask her what she prefers and give her the option of taking the kids out for a morning or afternoon so she gets a comparable break. Agree on a weekly time and put it on the calendar so she gets a break no matter what. She can make plans if she wants to or she can just go take a bath and a nap without being interrupted.", "It could also be possible that she might want to spend some time with you.... Maybe you guys can drop the kid at some place and spend some time together .....", "Agreeing with many in this chain.  \n\nInstead of telling her to make plans and bounce them off you, put your plans on a shared calendar that she can see.  And/or establish a time (like Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings) or whatever that are when you'll avoid scheduling things for yourself so that she can get her haircut, go to yoga, go parasailing, whatever it is she wants to be doing without feeling like she has to ask your permission.", "Please do! As a stay at home mum of 3 (even though their dad is amazing and does everything) I never feel like I can ask for me time because I feel guilty for even asking for it. It gets to the point where my partner will just tell me he is going to go do something with the kids and takes them out and i get a chance to do what i want.", "Mom guilt is a powerful thing.", "The one child is at school. So what is she doing?", "It's hard to see when the job is preventing problems before they arise, especially with children.", "I like this idea. Going to try this before the next event.", "SHE'S the one that needs to communicate her problem. OP, like most humans, is not a mindreader.", ">They've entered into a partnership where he likely vowed to hold her happiness dear to him.\n\nAnd yet she resents him for finding happiness in a monthly 3 hour walk", "Lol. Really exhausted from making choices. Some of yall will contort yourselves into pretzels to make a woman the victim sometimes", "Yeah she said she liked it a lot more than she expected. The bar credit didn\u2019t hurt \ud83d\ude1c", "During the day I would assume she is doing the housework? If she isn\u2019t and is just leaving it for OP to do when he gets home then I \ud83d\udcaf agree with you", "So you do all the cooking, 95% of chores, look after your child in the mornings and walk her to school, and take turns to put her to bed\u2026all while working a full time job and taking on financial responsibilities?\n\nThis is not an equal division of labour at all. \n\nSure, she has to look after your child all day during school holidays, but normally she would be freed up during school hours. What does your wife do during this time? Because she isn\u2019t doing chores.\n\nYour wife is not pulling her weight. If this has been going on for some time and you think she has depression, she needs to seek help because this is not fair on you. \n\nNTA", "Bar credits definitely add to the fun!", "I asked OP that and he says she has no housework. Maybe the occasional dish he forgets to do. That\u2019s why I\u2019m confused. She gets to have a lie in every morning because he gets up with the child and takes her to school. Then when he finishes work, he does the chores and trades turns putting her to bed. So, I\u2019m not 100% sure on school times (maybe 8-3?) but that would suggest wife is free until this time every day.", "Okay yes, then I am extremely confused too. OP can you clarify? If this is the case maybe she doesn\u2019t understand why OP needs breaks because she has so many (reverse of what I initially assumed)."]}
