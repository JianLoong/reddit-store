Where you can go for breakfast (or offer to cook yourself if you can do things like waffles) lunch, parks for your kiddo to play, dinner for the night.

Personally, I find PoGo really helpful for getting out of the house, and I've made some good friends (I'm a middle-aged woman).  \n\nThe other thought I had was that when my kids were young, there was a point where I felt like I'd lost my identity as a person. She might not know what she likes or wants to do.", "Fr. This man cooks all the meals, cleans everything, gets his daughter to school, works all day, comes home to take care of the kid and takes care of the kid on the weekends too. He is on the clock 24/7 and the only real breaks he gets are a monthly date night and a monthly 3 hour walk.\n\nIn comparison his wife does fuck all housework, has no career and only looks after the kid after school and on the weekends. She gets 8 hours a day, 5 days a week of free time with 0 work or responsibilities and somehow can't find time to have a hobby or hang out with her SAHM friend.\n\nAnd somehow it's still OP's fault that he's not giving her even more free time to go be with a friend. I really want to know wtf this woman is doing during the 40 hours per week where she is childfree. There's literally no work to do!\n\nIf you swapped the genders, everyone would be calling the man a bum. I'd go mad if I was on OP's schedule", "Had he planned something for her. Half these commenters would have called him misogynist for assuming a woman wants a spa day. Maybe she wanted to do something else. Your wife can choose for hereelf, your controlling for\nDeciding for\nHer. You are using your income and financial abusing her. Its like some of these people just copy paste their opinions", "Unless they homeschool or deferred kindergarten. We simply don't have those details. It was still a reasonable suggestion.", "I think this is key. I posted more further down, but with being a SAHP there is no clear \u201coff the clock\u201d time. \n\nYou have clear work hours. So it makes sense that you see weekends or evenings as potential \u201cthis is fun, relax, me time\u201d. \n\nShe works 24/7. There is no clear \u201cthis is fun, relax, me time\u201d. It\u2019s all work time in her work place. There\u2019s no clock out. \n\nSo creating structure where there\u2019s built in \u201coff the clock time\u201d for her would be the most effective way to go about both getting equal rest time.", "I have a friend who will plan daddy/daughter play dates when he wants his wife to have forced time off.  I think for some people it's really hard to turn off that mom guilt (or dad guilt) and carve out a little time for yourself.  But we all need it!", "Thank you for saying what I was thinking, but afraid to write. In general, why do some on reddit expect a partner to become a mind reader for another adult? Encourage, support, facilitate, yes. Read another person's mind and know what they would like to do?  If I met the OP, I bet, never in a million years would I guess they are Pok\u00e9mon fans (OK, the tee shirt might give it away).", "Now he has to do the emotional labor of planning her leisure activities because she is too infantile to do it herself?\n\nCould you imagine if the roles were reversed and a bored guy was making his breadwinner wife plan his leisure actives cause he can\u2019t do it himself.", "it's not a matter of less dominant/more dominant. it's not a matter of communication. it's a matter of the wife, for whatever reason, not making her own plans and since she can't think of anything she gets on her husband for being able to - which is an asshole move.\n\nif she's that hard up for ideas, wife can legit just get in the car, get on the bus, take a walk somewhere and wander around until something strikes her interest or finds a restaurant she likes.", "Usually women do this work. We don\u2019t complain, let alone call men infantile for it. In fact, here I am. Top comment doing the emotional labour for OP.", "Dear lord. People are allowed to have a different communication style than you. Relationship conflicts are normal.", ">We don\u2019t complain, let alone call men infantile for it.\n\njumping threads to ask if this is your first day on this sub?? asking honestly because let me tell you, both on AITA and in general... can attest. there is complaining and a ton of rightfully calling it out as infantile.", "> We don\u2019t complain, let alone call men infantile for it.\n\nAre you for real? Women doing the mental load is like the rallying cry of AITA in general.", "i'm also allowed to call someone an asshole for saying \"it's not fair\" and blaming her husband in this situation since a) OP is handling plenty of the emotional/mental/physical load both at work and at home, b) OP isn't blocking his wife from doing things, c) OP is in fact encouraging his wife to do whatever she wants to do, and d) ensures there's time as a couple on top of time as a family. \n\nthus in my opinion, which i'm able to share, this isn't a communication breakdown but the wife being an asshole. which you can be in one situation without being an overall bad person.", ">Op is a dad and husband, he can\u2019t distract the daughter while the wife goes off to something of her choosing\n\nWhat kind of absurd statement is this? You can *absolutely* distract your child and allow the other partner a break. Are men incapable of engaging with children?", "If it is within the boundaries of the relationship, there is no reason to be angry about a more passive communication style from either gender IMO. As long as both are genuinely trying to solve problems together.", "You can absolutely feel that way. You are commenting under my comment though, and you haven\u2019t convinced me of your perspective. I think in general it is better to assume both members of a relationship are trying unless there is evidence to the contrary. In my relationship we both check in on each other and ask probing questions, so I\u2019m not inclined to see this as a red flag. \n\nThe only thing I will say is that there are a lot of unanswered questions about how labour is distributed in their home in general. But that\u2019s not what this post is actually about and OP hasn\u2019t expressed discomfort over that aspect.", "\"We do go out on date nights at least once a month when our 6 year old stays the night with Grandma.\"\n\n\"Not to toot my own horn but a lot. I wake up with my daughter every morning, while she was in school I walked her every day, I have a daily house cleaning routine, between the two of us I am the only one who can cook - so unless it\u2019s microwaved or takeout I\u2019m making the meals. We do trade off who does the bed time routine.\"\n\n\nThere is plenty of context from OP, this took me 60 seconds."]}
