Around when I was off my friend messaged that she got a last minute slot for a quick hair apt which the salon is just down my street walking distance. She let me know the apt would go till 5 and she would come after that. I get home I begin cooking. I'm done cooking and message my friend to see how it's going (it's about 5:15 now) no answer. Call, no answer. I see she's active on snapchat. 6:00 we decide to eat without her. My spouse ended up eating more than his share (in his eyes you snooze you lose). Around 6:30-6:45 my friend shows up. By then supper was over and done, we were on to dessert. I offered her dessert which she had but ultimately I didn't have any food leftover from supper to feed her. She hung around for 45 mins to an hour before saying she had to go home to make herself supper. She must've been bothered as well cause she reiterated that she needed to go home to eat multiple times. She even called her roommate over speaker phone just so we could hear that she was giving him cooking instructions.\n\nAITA cause I didn't wanna wait for someone that couldn't give me communication that they were going to be over an hour late? We did invite her over for food that we essentially ate on her lol.\n\nedit: typo lol\n\nedit #2: I should also include that when she did show up she brought over the hairdresser friend as a surprise to me. I don't have issues with the surprise pop in by the friend but again... my friend knew we had supper plans.

She was invited to a home not a 24 hour diner. I would have told her it's too late and not to bother coming by at all. Did she give any reason for being extremely late?", "NTA\n\nwhat your friend did was bloody rude, and then to bring someone without asking first doubly rude.\n\nTBH I wouldn't have even given her desert if she was that late", "NTA - Your friend is a disrespectful guest.", "NTA\nYour friend was very rude. She should have cancelled if her hair appointment was so important - which is still rude but at least avoided the awkwardness.", "NTA, not only was she late, she did not have the courtesy to call and tell you.. I am glad there was no food for her, she is lucky she was offered dessert. Trying to bully you with the calls to her roommate only make her look worse.", "NTA\n\nDinner was at 5 pm.  She skipped dinner.  \n\nAlso, it was extremely rude of her to invite another guest without discussing it with you first.", "She does not have a clue about proper behavior.\n\nBeing that late is problem number one. Bringing a stranger along with her is problem number two.\n\nI would take a big step back", "90 minutes late? Lol why even show up. Nta 10000%. If there was communication then this would be an entirely different story, but why save food for some one who may or may not even show?", "NTA.  She said one thing. She didn't have the decency to update you, nor answer the phone. Then she compounded her rude behavior by bringing over an uninvited guest.  Not sure why you should think you're the AH. She owes you an apology.", "NTA, of course. I used to have some chronically late friends, and when they would do shit like this I would just immediately insist to reschedule the hang out. If they were late without a warning I would text or call letting them know the schedule and then proceed. Some friends got better at it, or did it so infrequently it wasn\u2019t a big deal, and some others aren\u2019t friends anymore which works out fine.", "That is a long hair appt, and she needed to communicate.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Was she expecting you to feed the surprise friend as well? If she had even called to say she would be late, as well as bring another person, she would have at least had some manners but nope. She's either really rude or just really inconsiderate.", "NTA - Your friend should have called you and cancelled when she got her hair apointment. Or just told you she'd come over after but to eat.", "NYA. Never hold up dinner for everyone because some inconsiderate ass is late.
