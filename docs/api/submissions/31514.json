Around when I was off my friend messaged that she got a last minute slot for a quick hair apt which the salon is just down my street walking distance.

I offered her dessert which she had but ultimately I didn't have any food leftover from supper to feed her. She hung around for 45 mins to an hour before saying she had to go home to make herself supper. She must've been bothered as well cause she reiterated that she needed to go home to eat multiple times. She even called her roommate over speaker phone just so we could hear that she was giving him cooking instructions.\n\nAITA cause I didn't wanna wait for someone that couldn't give me communication that they were going to be over an hour late? We did invite her over for food that we essentially ate on her lol.\n\nedit: typo lol\n\nedit #2: I should also include that when she did show up she brought over the hairdresser friend as a surprise to me.

She owes you an apology.", "NTA, of course. I used to have some chronically late friends, and when they would do shit like this I would just immediately insist to reschedule the hang out. If they were late without a warning I would text or call letting them know the schedule and then proceed.

Once 5 hit she should\u2019ve let you know she\u2019d be late and to please save a plate.", "You are better off without this toxic person in your life. Think of this event as the litmus test for your tolerance level. You tolerated too much and now you have exposed your weakness to her. She will increase her abuse. This will negatively impact your marriage. If your husband loves you he will become frustrated with your door mat behavior because he wants to protect you from her abuse. If he doesn\u2019t love you he will mirror her behavior and no one will have your back. You are not responsible for other people\u2019s bad behavior. However , you are responsible for the way you respond. It sounds like you are a good person and I trust that you will not let this happen again. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. She's not a friend.", "Nta. Your friend was rude. She made alternative plans knowing she was supposed to have dinner.

We've already finished eating. Perhaps another time. Goodnight.\"", "NTA but your friend is. Who tf pulls that kind of crap? Not only being that late but then also bringing a stranger to your home?! Hell no. The smart thing for her to do would have been to either not go to the hairdresser or to text you to let you know she couldn't make it after all. Personally, I don't keep friends like this because they're usually inconsiderate and selfish.", "NTA but that\u2019s not a friend.", "NTA  Your friend is inconsiderate.", "NTA. BUT YOU DIDNT HAVE TO EAT IT ALL.", "ESH. It's not just your friend who sucks at communicating. Did you tell her when she first said she was gonna be late, that you had a rigid plan for when you serve dinner? Regardless of if she's late, I think your husband was out of line to eat the rest of the food. Your friend was rude for being late and bringing a guest without asking. It sounds like you both had very different expectations for what the night would look like. Maybe next time she asks to hangout you should get on the same page for what type of visit it is. A casual hang where you eat when convenient or a sit down dinner where you have to be on time or risk having your portion eaten by the husband who wants to lock people out of the house so he can eat more.", "Half the ass hole because she didn't cancel the plans but you ate all of the food then served her dessert which would make anyone sick. She should be considerate of your time but you, in return, were not considerate of her.", "So ummm if this is not really your real friend NTA. But if this was one of my friends which I only have friends I am close to, I would put a plate aside for when and if they show up and tell my husband to keep his grubby hands off. So I guess you could be the AH depending on the closeness of the friendship. And as for it being rude to not ask if you had enough food for the hair stylist. You did not even have enough food to save your friend some sooo\u2026", "ESH, bad hosts and rude guest", "NTA. She didn't care about the time you spent cooking or even about being late without notice. AND bring someone to your house without even asking you if you were okay with visits.\nI would go low contact. Someone who doesn't respect you and your time doesn't deserve to be in your life.", "NTA\n\nHope she learned something about respecting other people's time.", "NTA.\n\nYou waited an hour, you did more than your due diligence on that front.", "NTA your friend could've easily let you know she was running late, especially since you said she was active on snap chat.\n In my opinion, your friend is TA for \n1. Showing up late, without letting you know prior\n2. Making a speaker call about her dinner\n3. Surprising you with an extra guest, presumably for dinner\nNTA", "Definitely NTA. Your friend seems incredibly inconsiderate and wasteful of your time. Super disrespectful to show up that late with no warning and also bringing a friend along (that I assume she thought you would feed as well).", "NTA, people who do this are incredibly infuriating.", "If the hairdresser friend didn't come over, would there have been enough left over for her?\n\nNTA. If you're going to dinner at someone's place, you show up on time. No excuses and scheduling a hair appt after you make plans is def not a legitimate excuse. That's super inconsiderate.", "NTA - your friend was extremely inconsiderate", "NTA, I have a friend who does this too. She's chronically late. I've gotten to the point where I did the same thing, I'll eat without her. It's so disrespectful. You took the time to go to the store and prepare the food to be hot and ready when she was originally supposed to get there", "She\u2019s the AH for being 2 hours late are you kidding?  That\u2019s so rude. \n\nYou\u2019re supposed to starve waiting for her?  If she had bothered to get in touch with you to at least tell you she was going to be late - you could have told her to get dinner because dinner has already been served!\n\nShe\u2019s so obnoxious.  Zero respect for your time and the fact that you prepared dinner for her.\n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of being stood up - that\u2019s how late she was!", "NTA. How rude of your friend to be so unfashionably late to your dinner. And to, without so much as a heads-up, bring another uninvited person is inexcusable. How could she possibly assume that what you made for the meal would stretch to another unexpected guest? No, there is no way you should feel like you did anything wrong. There are rules of etiquette that go along with dinner invitations, and she broke them all.", "You\u2019re super nice. Your friends the asshole.", "NTA I fucking hate it when people do shit like this. She makes an appointment right before dinner? WTF? Now you should have put a hard stop to her like \u201chey, you didn\u2019t answer. Just to let you know we\u2019re eating at 5:30 anyway. Sorry\u201d.", "You\u2019re not the ahole.   It\u2019s very rude for someone to arrive very late to a dinner invite.  And even more rude that she brought a friend.", "Esh\u2026.NTA for eating without her but YTA for not setting aside a plate especially since you knew she Went to the appointment after work. If she never showed, you could\u2019ve taken the extra for lunch.

It's not just your friend who sucks at communicating. Did you tell her when she first said she was gonna be late, that you had a rigid plan for when you serve dinner?\n\n\nRigid? \n\nAfter an hour? In this telephone/call/text age?", ">then served her dessert which would make anyone sick\n\n\n\nDessert makes people sick? \n\nTIL.. \ud83e\udd14", "I agree with this take. Sure, the friend was an AH for showing up late or not at least communicating that they would be late, but I would definitely wrap up a plate for my friend either way.\n\nIf OP didn't have enough for her husband to have seconds and also to feed her guest, it sounds like poor planning.", "Oh honey it was very passive aggressive.  What she was saying was you need to make her something to eat without saying that directly to you.  So NTA. I tell you I'm serving dinner at 5? Guess what time dinner is ready.  No later than 5:05. She was very rude. And yes you are too nice. But I get it.  Sometimes I am too cause I'm a people pleaser. Getting better as I get older but I really have to watch myself.", "Well next time, serve her humble pie.", "I'd bet the hair appointment didn't start until after 5. I've had friends like that. I cut them out of my life because of their poor behavior.", "No not really.  She said she would be done at 5. No reason for you to assume anything. If was 30 minutes or so with communication then I would be like yea maybe you and hubby could have waited. But no communication and 90 minutes late? I agree with your hubs. To bad so sad", "If there was a time crunch, that would have been the time to say it. And I don't think it's reasonable to expect someone to be able to communicate 24/7 when they're providing hair services to a client who has already gone over time. Probably wearing gloves covered in product and trying to get the client out as fast as possible.\n\nWho has dinner at 6pm? That's so early. I just think OP and friend are living very different lifestyles based on the details in the post and they need to communicate their expectations more clearly.", "Without any kind of actual food in my stomach? Yeah makes me sick as fuck lol", "Maybe, but honestly, with his \"lock the door\" attitude, it almost sounds like he ate extra just so there wouldn't be enough for the friend of she came later.", "Apparently she is a toddler that needs training because you don't disrespect someone's time like that. Also \"if you're annoyed, talk to them\" is pretty hard to do when the ignore calls and texts.", "It sounds like she was the client, not the hairdresser though. Unless I'm reading it wrong", "So he ate enough for 3 people just to prove a point? If so, that's a whole new level of petty....\n\nI find that a little hard to believe, but I guess you never know.", "Probably not, but he does seem really extra annoyed about the whole thing,  so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
