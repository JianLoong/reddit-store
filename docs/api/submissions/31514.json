Regardless of if she's late, I think your husband was out of line to eat the rest of the food. Your friend was rude for being late and bringing a guest without asking. It sounds like you both had very different expectations for what the night would look like. Maybe next time she asks to hangout you should get on the same page for what type of visit it is.

If she had bothered to get in touch with you to at least tell you she was going to be late - you could have told her to get dinner because dinner has already been served!\n\nShe\u2019s so obnoxious.  Zero respect for your time and the fact that you prepared dinner for her.\n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of being stood up - that\u2019s how late she was!", "NTA. How rude of your friend to be so unfashionably late to your dinner. And to, without so much as a heads-up, bring another uninvited person is inexcusable. How could she possibly assume that what you made for the meal would stretch to another unexpected guest? No, there is no way you should feel like you did anything wrong. There are rules of etiquette that go along with dinner invitations, and she broke them all.", "You\u2019re super nice. Your friends the asshole.", "NTA I fucking hate it when people do shit like this. She makes an appointment right before dinner? WTF? Now you should have put a hard stop to her like \u201chey, you didn\u2019t answer. Just to let you know we\u2019re eating at 5:30 anyway. Sorry\u201d.", "You\u2019re not the ahole.

What she was saying was you need to make her something to eat without saying that directly to you.  So NTA. I tell you I'm serving dinner at 5? Guess what time dinner is ready.  No later than 5:05. She was very rude. And yes you are too nice. But I get it.  Sometimes I am too cause I'm a people pleaser. Getting better as I get older but I really have to watch myself.", "Well next time, serve her humble pie.", "I'd bet the hair appointment didn't start until after 5. I've had friends like that. I cut them out of my life because of their poor behavior.", "No not really.  She said she would be done at 5. No reason for you to assume anything. If was 30 minutes or so with communication then I would be like yea maybe you and hubby could have waited. But no communication and 90 minutes late? I agree with your hubs. To bad so sad", "If there was a time crunch, that would have been the time to say it. And I don't think it's reasonable to expect someone to be able to communicate 24/7 when they're providing hair services to a client who has already gone over time. Probably wearing gloves covered in product and trying to get the client out as fast as possible.\n\nWho has dinner at 6pm? That's so early. I just think OP and friend are living very different lifestyles based on the details in the post and they need to communicate their expectations more clearly.", "Without any kind of actual food in my stomach? Yeah makes me sick as fuck lol", "Maybe, but honestly, with his \"lock the door\" attitude, it almost sounds like he ate extra just so there wouldn't be enough for the friend of she came later.", "Apparently she is a toddler that needs training because you don't disrespect someone's time like that. Also \"if you're annoyed, talk to them\" is pretty hard to do when the ignore calls and texts.", "It sounds like she was the client, not the hairdresser though. Unless I'm reading it wrong", "So he ate enough for 3 people just to prove a point? If so, that's a whole new level of petty....\n\nI find that a little hard to believe, but I guess you never know.", "Probably not, but he does seem really extra annoyed about the whole thing,  so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You let your spouse eat her portion?", "Ok\u2026. NTA, but I will say that part of this is passive aggressive on your part, and though she was out of line for trying to make you feel guilty, I do think that you and your spouse exhibited behavior that created some of the issue. And here\u2019s why:  you could have messaged her at 6 and said \u201chey, since it\u2019s getting late, we\u2019re gonna go ahead and start dinner. Hit me up when you actually get off and maybe we could still have dessert or a cocktail, if it\u2019s not too late. \n\nIt was also passive aggressive of you guys to not let her know and then \u201cpunish her\u201d by letting your husband eat her food. \n\n\nAs somebody who has worked in a similar industry as your friend, it is always so difficult to know when you are actually going to get off of work. I\u2019ve missed several dinner start times by having an unexpectedly troublesome client. And it\u2019s frustrating because people with hourly paying jobs don\u2019t get that you are NOT choosing it to be disrespectful, you just need to make money. You are constantly hoping everything will work out the way you planned, but, ultimately, your client controls when you get off of work There are often so many factors that are out of your control because it\u2019s procedure specific. And it sounds to me she might be kind of an optimistic people pleaser, as well. She lost control of her evening, over extended, and was trying to make it normal. \n\nAlso, 5 PM is an insanely early time to eat an adult dinner. Considering that to be a hard dinner deadline almost feels like a set up. I doubt that she was ever going to be on time for that. So she probably took the start time a little more casually than you and your husband did. The only reason that she has no leg to stand on here is because you gave her an opportunity to communicate, and she brushed it off because she had overextended herself and didn\u2019t know how to be mature about it. I\u2019ve had a couple of those friends in my life.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of rubbing me the wrong way, how your husband is choosing to tell *you* how *you* are going to set boundaries with her in ways that benefit him, stir the pot, and ask you to indulge in passive aggressive behavior instead of just setting a clear boundary. Doubtless, he is tired of watching her be flaky with you, so I get the impulse, but his solution wasn\u2019t as helpful as it was putting you in the middle. \n\nHer bringing a friend was wildly inappropriate for a sit down dinner, and her not communicating with you was equally inappropriate, and it sounded like she needed a lesson in where you draw the line. But I bet you would\u2019ve felt a lot better if you had just texted her at six and told her that it was getting too late for you.", "She and her +1 probably went out for a cocktail or two after the apt, before going over to your place.", "Your spouse for being a hog is the asshole. Your friend for bringing an uninvited guest is the asshole", "NTA... does she have a history of doing this because this doesn't sound like it's a first-time issue? It sounds like she was counting on the free meal after getting her hair done, and when she didn't get that, she used her roommate to get it. I wouldn't be inviting that friend over again and to bring a surprise guest is rude since you weren't planning on an extra mouth and she didn't contribute anything to the meal.", "NTA and that second edit REALLY makes them the AH. If she had been in contact informing you she was delayed that would be one thing. But to show up an hour and a half-ish late with no communication AND an additional party makes them the absolute AH.", "As my mom used to say (in a southern hillbilly accent) \u201cSuppers on the table. Eat or go hungry.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou were fine. A petty voice in my head thinks, that in response to her exaggerated \"need to go home to eat\" messages, you could have just stretched and yawned big and said - \"*Yeah, it's really late and has been a long day, with going to the grocery store and cooking after I got home from work.*\"", "NTA. Last Christmas I had to work, but got invited to my bf's family's dinner. I told them what time I may be there. Did I expect them to wait for me? Absolutely not. They ate. I texted my bf updates on when I left, was on my way, and how close I was. By the time I got there, it was mostly over, but there was still food left and I ate and we had a lovely time.\n\nThe key here was communication so they knew what stage I was at and definitely coming. But I also wasn't expecting them to not eat until I got there.\n\nYour friend was horrendously rude and I wonder how her behavior is in general when it comes to other people's time.", "NTA....I have a friend who is always late so we always order our food and she will end up be 20 to 30 mins late.", "NTA", "NTA You are not a restaurant and even if you were, you would have given her table away by the time your asshole friend slouched in. She was just rude rude rude. I'd have made her feel unwelcome in the extreme. Dessert at the table alone while I was watching TV cutting my toenails.", "Nta", "NTA. She\u2019s incredibly rude.

NTA.", "Your friend added a hair appointment, she did not have one, she added it. She made plans for dinner at your house then after confirming that she then decided at the last minute to insert a hair appointment that would make her late for dinner. Then she ignored your messages. Let\u2019s face it I\u2019m sure her phone was in her hand and she left you on read, since she is thoughtless, and only worries about herself and her own plans. She would not want to have to explain to you or update you while she is being so inconsiderate. Then she also springs a uninvited guest on you when she is massively late. Then she behaves as if you are in the wrong for not having dinner ready for her, and the unannounced extra person. I\u2019m in shock that you can\u2019t look at this sequence of events and see how self absorbed this person is behaving. Please be kinder to yourself, and place more boundaries around how you allow people to treat you.  You are not even close to wrong for eating without them.  NTA", "No, YANTAH \u2014 your friend was incredibly rude, by being so late and neither calling nor taking your calls and then by responding in a visibly rude manner.", "NTA invited and then invited someone else, only to be late?

Anything longer than that, they\u2019re the ridiculous one to think people are gonna sit around. If she had a different expectation of how the evening was going to go at your home, she should\u2019ve communicated that rather than be upset over her own expectations. NTA.", "NTA, but I think it would've been fine saving some for her. Her coming THAT late was very rude tho.", "NTA. And her passive aggressive reiterations that she needed to go home to eat just confirmed how rude she was being. Being 15 minutes late is one thing, but coming an hour and a half+ after the time she said she\u2019d be there, without so much as a text to let you know, was downright rude. She would never be invited to my house again for a meal, that\u2019s for sure.", "Esh \nLeaving no leftovers is just petty.

They are your friend right ? \nShes really milking it with making it obvs haha seems you guys are all petty.

It sounds like you\u2019re a little self-conscious about not waiting for her, and possibly your husband\u2019s response/behavior (eating more than his fair share). You\u2019re not rude for not waiting  if she knew the agreed timing for dinner.\n\nThough you also might have offered to push back the dinner time a bit. If dinner was ready at 5:15, she didn\u2019t expect to be done until 5 and is \u201cwalking distance\u201d but don\u2019t indicate how far/how long the walk is. Even a 5 minute walk means she\u2019s walking in the door and sitting right down. Also consider that you and your husband might eat dinner late in the afternoon/early evening but your friend might not be used to eating until a couple hours after work (especially if she\u2019s working standard office hours and might have eaten lunch). She might not have been hungry for dinner at 5p. So when she left and was making calls to ensure dinner was ready it\u2019s quite possible that\u2019s all she was doing\n\nShe was inconsiderate in not providing an update, but she really could have been indisposed at the salon after things took longer than anticipated (she was on Snapchat so still should have sent a quick text). \n\nShe enjoyed the dessert you offered and after hanging out a reasonable length of time she went home for real sustenance. \n\nShe had the forethought to call her roommate ahead of time to have dinner started. Unless she said \u201chey guys, I want you to hear this!\u201d There could have been valid reasons for calling her roommate on speaker. Maybe she had a skin treatment or had some reason she\u2019s didn\u2019t want her phone near her face/hair. Maybe she felt self conscious that she arrived late and was leaving after an hour, but she truly was just leaving because she needed real food and put the phone on speaker so you would hear that she was truly going home for dinner. It really could have been anything (though do consider that every one of your assumptions here incline to being negative)\n\nEspecially if it came at a point in the evening where y\u2019all were having a good time\u2026.i don\u2019t wanna leave but I\u2019m starving because I missed dinner.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like she made any comment about you not feeding her and she left because she was hungry. \n\nyou\u2019re reading things that might not be - she didn\u2019t comment about the lack of dinner, neither she nor the hairdresser commented on food but you worked yourself to the point of attitude (\u201cMaybe check in to make sure I have food for all\u201d) over feelings and actions you\u2019ve assumed have a negative undertone. \n\nIt\u2019s not even clear the friend agreed to come *for dinner* or if she was coming to hang and your husband suggested y\u2019all make dinner. \u201cPlans were made\u201d by whom and what exactly was agreed vs what was breezy/down for whatever.\n\nYou say she couldn\u2019t give you communication but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re communicating with her and that you\u2019re letting your anxiety about her being upset color the whole night in a negative light. are you all Mid/late 20s? \n\nMaybe just ask her if she was ok when she left the other night because honestly it sounds like the upset is one-sided.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you said you and your husband are introverts and your friends is an extrovert. This sounds like a classic introvert/extrovert friendship misunderstanding.\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be shocked if you brought it up to your friend and she had no idea what you were on about and did a hand-flop dust-off that she hadn\u2019t given it a thought. \n\nNTA", "Yep, the trifecta.", "You sound like you behave like the rude guest who showed up hours late with an uninvited guest. It's their food, the 'guest' was hours late, they can do what they want with their food. Wow.", "Who cares? The guest was late, refused to communicate even though she was active online, she brought an uninvited guest. I'd eat as much of MY food as I wanted to as well. FFS.", "Almost ESH  for me too.  She is way TA for not letting you know she would be late, (is it possible she said it started at 5?),  bringing a random, & the passive aggressive phone call, your husband is a huge AH. For all he knows she was in a wreck and what is he starving?! He ate a whole extra meal? Ridiculous and of insensitive to what was happening to you. The hair dresser is an asshole for not only mismanaging her schedule but also not having the social awareness  not to show up unannounced no matter what your AH friend said. You are a very small AH 1. For eating at 5pm unless you are over the age of 65 & 2. For letting your husband think it's cool to gobble up her meal.", "She was the client not the hairdresser. She was rude and OPs husband had every right to say and do whatever he wants in his house, including eat the food. She was insanely late and brought a guest she didnt ask if she could she just brang her. OP is a bit of a doormat and needs to take husbands lead with setting boundries since she has trouble. Eating at 5 is actually better for you, just because you like to eat late and make sure that food turns into fat doesn't mean others do.\nShe is NTA, the friend is a massive a-hole tho who has no respect for others.", "Why not? It's their food, the 'guest' did not bother to show up, Judge McJudgey. Sheesh.", "I wouldnt have held dinner, but I do think having no food left is a bit much. Otoh, her bringing a surprise +1 also kind of sucks. So ETA.", "What if it was much more innocuous\u2026what if she was embarrassed that she showed up late, she actually was hungry by then, if y\u2019all were having fun she might\u2019ve felt guilty about bouncing after an hour- call on speaker to show you really are just going home to eat.\n\nEspecially if she doesn\u2019t know you\u2019ve viewed the totality of her actions as negative/sinister.\n\nI don\u2019t see where she complained/\u201cjoked\u201d about there being no food.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s a shit friend - it\u2019s def rude not to check in when she was running late - but maybe you\u2019re reading intentions that aren\u2019t there.\n\nI just don\u2019t read this as anything more than misinterpretation of actions. \n\nI mean, I think you\u2019re always going to be NTA here but I think there are a lot of details that might paint a clearer picture of the relationship on the whole (including what your friends think of your husband).\n\nI get the impression this girl likes you (she asked you to hang, and she brought someone along as a surprise, so presumably thought you\u2019d enjoy it\u2026). \n\nI mean, I think you\u2019re always going to be NTA here but I think there are a lot of details that might paint a clearer picture of the relationship on the whole (including what your friends think of your husband) and what\u2019s really going on.\n\nlol or take the aita scorched earth approach and cut her out. \n\nMaybe keep an eye on that husband tho", "Maybe read up on codependency.  There\u2019s a difference between being nice and being codependent.", "Well, your boyfriend isn't. I don't think you were at all in the wrong to start but why did he eat two servings?", "In my experience: shared blame is a luxury reserved for people with common sense. Your friend\u2026 seems lacking.", "It was even worse she brought someone else on top of being late!", "And then she came with someone - what if there was a dinner for her, but only her portion, like one piece of meat and some other stuff. What should you do then? Give her \"her\" dinner and the +1 friend was supposed to sit and watch her eating?", "Her bringing her own guest though? I would have a hard time letting my \u201cfriend\u201d know how uncool she is. I would\u2019ve done the same thing- \u201cwell, you can have dessert I guess.\u201d \nMaybe, \u201cHey, you better get going on your evening since all of our collective plans have fallen through. Thanks for the pit stop- so glad you could enjoy the dessert I thoughtfully prepared for you before you had to leave\u2026 Another time, perhaps\u201d then never answer those calls for another 10 years when hopefully she wised up. Some people never do though. \nNTA and you seem like a super nice friend. Are you in the Midwest? \ud83e\udd17", "Please stop saying you're too nice. I used to say that about myself. I wasn't too nice. I was a doormat. You are a person of value. Saying it with me- I am a person of value... You're trying to excuse your own behavior. There is a difference between nice and a pushover. I know how hard it is. I was the peacekeeper and a \"make sure everyone is happy\" person for far too long. The fact is, you can't make everyone happy. Ever. It is exhausting. I'm sorry you needed validation here. You're in deep, chica. Has she done this to you before? Either way, have a conversation abt it. If she is a repeat offender, she's out. Surround yourself with ppl who respect, value and care about you. Hugs, OP.", "Seems like it would\u2019ve been nicer to just lock the door. She could\u2019ve gone with her friend to grab dinner somewhere else rather than everyone sit through awkwardness. What kind of friends are you? Regardless of how late, I would\u2019ve just left some food for my friend.", "You've never had a guest be late for a casual dinner? Do you usually just eat their portion? Seems pretty passive aggressive to me. And the drama of saying he wanted to lock her out. No, I wouldn't show up with an uninvited guest or fail to communicate when running late, but I can see how this would happen if they're on completely different pages for what the visit actually entailed. It was less than two hours, not \"hours\".", "First of all, OP asked for an opinion. I gave mine. Now you are judging me for saying they aren't the AH for proceeding with dinner. But with the caveat that they/husband didn't have to eat everything in one sitting.\n\nBut who's judging who here?", "My thoughts exactly. A friend shouldn\u2019t treat someone like that.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like the friend complained about dinner, there\u2019s nothing that indicates she was expecting the hairdresser to be fed, she might\u2019ve just been actually hungry at 7:30/7:45 which might be closer to her typical dinner time than 5/5:15.\n\nThe friend was def rude for not texting an update but mostly this reads like a classic misunderstanding between an introvert and an extrovert.", "Do you mean ESH?", "I don\u2019t see where the friend complained about not /being fed or where there was an expectation the hairdresser expected to be fed.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t rushing to leave. She stayed an hour. Maybe at 7:30 she truly was just hungry for something a little more substantial than dessert. Maybe she called on speakerphone to get dinner started because she was enjoying herself but was hungry and didn\u2019t want OP to think she was rolling up late and bouncing early\u2026like to legitimize\u2026see!!! I\u2019m just gonna make dinner\u2026even gonna get roomie to get it started!!\n\nOP has assumed a lot of intention behind some pretty benign actions (rudeness of not checking in and maybe for bringing a friend by without asking)\n\nMaybe OPs husband was making the friend uncomfortable and she was looking for a polite/legit reason to get away from the guy (it doesn\u2019t sound like he was prepared to be nice to the friend, even going as far as \u201ceating more than his share\u201d because \u201cyou snooze you lose\u201d and rueing that he should\u2019ve locked the door?\n\nI just don\u2019t read any of this with the negativity and cynicism of some of these comments.\n\nThis is the first ETA/ESH I\u2019ve run across. \n\nTo me it sounds like husband is an AH, that he and OP are very introverted, and that the friend is an extrovert (who I\u2019d not be surprised if she was clueless there was ever an issue)", "Not nearly enough people do this and have 'consequences' for bad behavior so people never learn them at the right times and it always ends up being someone else's fault.

What with food for her? Was she supposed to sit and watch the first friend eating or what?", "It makes my tummy upset too so you make sense \ud83d\ude29", "How is this a classic misunderstanding between an introvert and an extrovert?", "People like that never learn. They always twist the story, so everyone else is the problem. That woman is a parasite.", "Oohhh good point ok, I reread and I think you're right. That changes my stance, I thought she was picking up an extra client but if she just booked her own hair appnt last minute that is another ding against her. And for sure if she's the one in the chair she could have texted more frequently! Sorry to the above commenter(Fit_Bumblebee) I do agree in that case that the friend should have communicated a lot better."]}
