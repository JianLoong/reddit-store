I know you are tired of it, but think of it like that, they care so much about you that they go through all that effort.  I don't care how annoying it is, when people try to honestly tell me about their faith, I can't help but respect them and feel honored.   To them what they do isn't just some annoying flyering/door to door jaunt, but they are trying to make a difference based on their beliefs.\n\nYou taking the effort to send them that shit is just kind of cringe.\n\nEdit:  Your first response should be to stop using religious stuff as a shield, but you should have just put up a sign that says do not disturb or something, or no solicitors.  You dug your own grave with that Baphomet offering shit.  All your defense against the dark arts stuff is definitely worth more time and effort than opening your door and saying \"not interested\" or throwing away mailers.", "Lol NTA it's about time they got a taste of their own medicine. It's obnoxious how often people will try to preach and convert, to be quite honest it's harassment, and I'm tired of the double standards.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like something I used to do, lol.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that they can not respect your preferences shows how much they care.", "YTA - a simple note on your door 'no solicitation or religious appeals' is usually enough to stop visitors like this. Then if someone still knocks, you tell them politely but firmly that you're not interested. If they continue, you contact their local church/Mormon Temple/Kingdom Hall and tell them you wish to be placed on a permanent no-contact list (you'll probably want to do that right away in your case). If they ignore that, contact the police and take them to court for a restraining order.\n\nHowever, you don't need to aggravate the issue, which is what you're doing with the whole satanic thing. You're engaging them, and that's the last thing you want to do, since it tells them that you're willing to have a discussion. Stonewalling is really the only thing that works in these cases - make it clear you're a no-go and they'll leave you alone, particularly if you let them know you'll involve the law if you need to.", "I mean yah, YTA. And I\u2019m saying this AS and atheist who gets annoyed with anyone attempting to \u201cenlighten me\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a core difference: they actually believe in what they\u2019re trying to convert you to. You are an atheist yet attempting to convert them to a religion you don\u2019t even practice?\n\nYou\u2019re bad at setting boundaries and have taken an extreme. Even resorting to a weird hyper fixation. \n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to learn about your religion.

You had the moral high ground to start, you told them to leave you alone and they didn\u2019t - but then instead of enforcing your wish to be left alone, you turned this into a fanaticism arms race.  You\u2019re just encouraging them.", "ESH.  I am also atheist, so I get the hatred of the proselytizing, but that's what their religion also tells them that they have to do.  Be rude to them when they continue to harass you about it.  Tell them you could never pray to a god that would send a poor hindu child who died of starvation to eternity of suffering due to where and who they were born to.  But sending letters and bibles to them?  You're no better.", "The only thing I'm going to say is you're cementing the ideology that people outside their religion are going to tease/belittle/mock their attempts in their eyes to bring good into your life. A lot of people who are told to try to convert people have these negative, impactful interactions which is compounded by their religious leaders telling them \"see? They won't ever understand and they'll always hate you and treat you this way.\" Its a cult programming tactic that you're participating in with your \"gotcha!\" moment. Either step away and stop communicating with these people in your life or just stop feeding into the religious bickering and grey rock whenever it comes up.", "NTA - These people are obnoxious and deserve no respect at all.  I feel as if all the folks giving Y T A responses are simply their compatriots who think it's fine to abuse and harrass people over their beliefs.", "Lmao, NTA, religious people unfortunately don't understand the concept of \"NO\" (and doesn't even try to understand it), and have to push their fairy tales on others, they had it coming.", "NTA. If they can try to \u201cconvert\u201d you then you can do the exact same thing. Fair game. Is is petty? Maybe. But I never fault people for being petty.", "NTA. As a pagan and practicing witch, I deeply sympathize, and totally see the logic behind what you\u2019re doing. Like you, I regularly have family and friends try to convert me, I have been accosted by various Christian denominations in public trying to convert me. I\u2019ve even been told by someone that \u201cit\u2019s such a shame really, you\u2019re such a nice girl. Too bad you\u2019re not a Christian, it makes me so sad that someone so nice is going to hell.\u201d \nThe best way to deal with these people is to ignore them, I know that sounds counter productive but, as you\u2019re currently seeing, using their own tactics against them only stirs up their self righteousness and determination to convert you\u2026.. for the ones that refuse to leave me alone, I tell them to mind their own afterlife. You\u2019re not an ahole, but you\u2019ve definitely gone about this the wrong way\u2026 these sorts of people are not the kind that understand the word \u201cno\u201d, they think it means \u201cconvince me\u201d. They believe so whole heartedly that their beliefs are right and you are wrong that surely one day you will see how \u201cwrong\u201d you are and come over to Christ\u2026.. some of them also believe that converting you, and the rest of us who believe differently, will get them in their god\u2019s good books and will help get them into heaven\u2026. You can\u2019t fight this beast with its own tactics, it only makes them more determined. Good luck, friend, I truly mean that. (Edit for misspelling)", "NTA.  You are a hero.", "NTA.

I also have jehovah witness grandparents who try to convert me. \n\nIm not atheist but I\u2019m not Christian/catholic/etc. \n\nI get visited frequently by witnesses as well and while I do find it annoying, I just try to be the bigger person. \n\nI don\u2019t answer the door and just listen and walk away.", "Yes they Jehova witness have a no contact list. Im in the no contact list. But my uncle dont want to respect that. They continue to send letters..", "No is a complete sentence and clearly OP's family doesn't respect their boundaries.  NTA. OP, I hope they finally get the message and stop harassing you.", "If they understand that.. i tell them exact the same words.. i dont want to learn about your religion, im ateist. Still coming to visit every single saturday for 11 months.. then the pandemic and the lockdown hit, and then usr fe USPS to send letters 2 or 3 every week..", "Some religions have fruit offerings at temples.

They're not sending stuff to random Christians; they're sending it specifically to people they know who are harassing them via mail.", "Ok. I think your uncle might be the one to blame here. Hate to say it. As someone who knows a lot of JWs, it IS draining. Those who aren\u2019t JWs aren\u2019t supposed to even be engaged with, other than to try to convert. I studied 2 books for 2 years. I promised a lady I would do so, if she would promise to remain friends with me if I didn\u2019t want to be a JW. They are very persistent and I do understand wanting them to quit preaching. I think most people don\u2019t realize this is the only thing JWs do. I mean they don\u2019t feed the hungry, cloth the naked, just preach. No personal improvement as this is Satan\u2019s world and they are waiting for mass genocide.", "Look honestly, I empathize. Religious fanatics are the worst. I am just not gonna agree with the super unhealthy fixation and weird obsession over sending other religious texts. It\u2019s the same thing but worse because you aren\u2019t even practicing that religion.", "Agreed.   That's why they all suck."]}
