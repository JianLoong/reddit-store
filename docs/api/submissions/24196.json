That is not appropriate to watch in front of a child or in public spaces\"\n\nMe: \"Look I'm sorry I dont have anything else to watch or read you cant really expect me to be 3 hours on this plane doing nothing\"\n\nI then proceed to tilt the screen towards me and continue watching. But her kid still seems interested and ignores his mom.\n\nThe mom then starts complaining out loud about how rude and inappropriate it is. After a while I just say \"If you are that bothered either switch sits with your son or move somewhere else in the plane\"\n\nShe then gave me the stink eye before switching places with her son.
