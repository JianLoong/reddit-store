I joined there company when I was 17, we had about 4 people working under them. 2 on my dads side and 2 on Joe's side to split the workload up. After awhile we had 6 people on my dads side and 15 on Joe's side. My dads side worked more hours and did better work in general. After about 4 years my dad sells his share of the company to Joe and left. I worked there for a year after he left everyone that worked on my dads side left and started there own fiber business. So in that year I went up in a bucket truck and got electrocuted and had to be hospitalized. So my boss Joe tried cutting my pay from 28 an hr to 16 an hr because he could trust me. So I put my 2 weeks in right then and there. And a little note I ran contracting for 4 companies, like Google, century link, spectrum, and great plains. They all knew me and like the work I did for them. I told them I will no longer be working at this company. So they immediately cut all ties and got a few job offers from them. So I made them lose about 2-3 million dollars of work. I dont feel bad because Joe was a complete ahole but someone said I was a ahole for doing that. I now work at a start up company making 32 an hr im a manager/ trainer for fiber splicing and im loving it. I get to make hours for my guys and pretty good friends with everyone I hired now, and im going to have a share of the company since I'm helping starting it up. But AITA for making them loss business.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
