You do your brother a solid and he picks fights with both your kids within days of arriving over a few cents on the utilities?!?!?

Also why didn\u2019t anyone else take him in then?", "The fact that he started that shit was weird as hell. I can see why he's divorced and jobless.

Who does your brother think he is? Why is he under the impression that he can unilaterally make rules for your children?", "ESH- not for kicking your brother out, but because of the inconsistent way that you handled the situations with your kids.

You just taught your son it\u2019s not okay to stand up for himself, and that self defense is a punishable crime. You understand what a severe parenting fuck up that is right? Never do something like that again, especially if you want confident genuine children with good self esteem and happy productive lives and relationships.", "NTA he starts dictating to your children what they are doing wrong to the point of making up rules 'you can only have 1 thing on at a time\" that's a house rule he's suddenly imposing on your son. 'too much water' on the daughter.

You are such a caring woman.\n\nUncle Tio--your shining example of letting dear brother stay at your house, rent free, from Friday through Sunday is something to I can only aspire to do.  You epitomize the word family.\n\nCousin Primo--your exemplary offer to drive dear brother anywhere he needs to go free of charge, fills me with awe.\n\nCousin Prima--your offer to feed dear brother whenever he needs food at no cost, well that is the very definition of family.\"\n\nAdjust as needed, send out, and get the popcorn out to start seeing the excuses flow. :)", "NTA.

Tell the family members who think he should get a second chance to open their doors to him.", "I think you should give him another chance. Homeless shelters suck. Try it again and have a conversation about it properly. He said he would let it go. I would\u2019ve seen if that was true before giving him the boot. You should give him another chance. He\u2019s obviously just worried about money. I don\u2019t think it was malicious or meant to be. Of course its rude to try to be the man of the house and make rules where he doesn\u2019t actually live in. That would be hard for kiddos for sure. I dont think youre an asshole at all though. I just wouldn\u2019t want my sibling in a homeless shelter if i could help them. You just have to set the rules and say theres no changing the kids lives bc hes not the parent.

Your bro was def overreacting about the power and water to a crazy level. But kicking him out right away is sort of an overreaction too; u could have given him a 2nd chance just saying. But I get it he was def going over board and sometimes siblings change but he prob would have stirred up some other problems if he'd stayed.", "NTA. I guess you just learned why he is getting divorced and lost his job. Or maybe he\u2019s feeling emasculated and like a loser so he tried to be the big man of the house to feel more in control except neither of your kids wanted to put up with that bull.", "NTA - How 'bout these couple of family members stepping up and giving him a place to stay.", "I would play dumb and say, \"It's kind of you to offer to take ______ into your home.\" Try to say it in a sincere tone, and try not to make a face.", "For laughs, I plugged in the actual numbers and at the current average rate for electricity in the US with the maximum actual recorded power draw of a PS5 and the time to make Totino's pizza rolls, we're talking .1608 cents.   \n\nDude isn't even nickle-and-diming.", "They didn't stand up for their son on the moment though...", "THIS. He was marking his new territory.  His sister recognized it for what it was and he lost the pissing contest.", "He was probably being rude back. You can stick up for yourself without being rude. Kids need to learn that early. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have preferred he went directly to her like her daughter did.", "Daughter didn\u2019t get into an argument with him. Son did. We don\u2019t know how nasty it got.", "yeah that was my view. when everyone doesn't like you what is  the defining element?", "For sassing the uncle", "You're right. Although, I am willing to cut some slack bc parent didn't yet realize what a AH brother is. Conceivably it was 'misunderstanding-yes, this is his home for now, don't be a little ah'\n\n\nDoes make you wonder about the kids' past experiences with their uncle that they immediately pushed back against him. I have a feeling they didn't like him to start off with.", "Of course, no parent is perfect. \ud83d\ude42"]}
