My brother got into it with her about wasting water. My daughter went straight to me and told me about it.

You were right not to let him pick it with your little kids. He could have brought it to you. If he's interested, just compare splitting the utility bill with paying utilities and rent. A few baths won't tip the balance.", "NTA for kicking out your brother.", "I understand why he's getting divorced. \nYou are NTA.

He was picking fights with your kids.", "NTA - he has mental health problems and who knows if they came before or after the divorce / job loss. \n\nits no fun for teenagers having a depressed unemployed person hanging around the house, giving them grief.\n\nWhen you are a guest in somebody's house, you fit in with their dynamic, not the other way around.  He wouldn't have pulled his energy saving nonsense on you", "Why did you ground your son from videogames, because he called out your brother on something you did too?", "All this showed is that your brother was trying to spend as little money as he could, I'm sure eventually he would be onto you too.

You do your brother a solid and he picks fights with both your kids within days of arriving over a few cents on the utilities?!?!?

Also why didn\u2019t anyone else take him in then?", "The fact that he started that shit was weird as hell. I can see why he's divorced and jobless. Is he autistic or something?\n\nAnyways, why did you ground your son? Why did you not immediately stop and have a conversation about what was going on? \n\nSoft YTA for that stuff, soft YTA to not have set ground rules, but NTA for kicking brother out, he can stay at anyone else that has a soft spot for him.", "NTA. Who does your brother think he is? Why is he under the impression that he can unilaterally make rules for your children?", "ESH- not for kicking your brother out, but because of the inconsistent way that you handled the situations with your kids. Why does your son get punished for essentially calling your brother on his crap, but you stepped up for your daughter when she experienced something similar?", "I only wonder why OP grounded her 9-year-old. He didn\u2019t seem to do anything wrong. Only wrong party here is the bro.
