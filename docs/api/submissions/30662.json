You made a post on reddit to get everybody to agree with you that your girlfriend is a bigot or a fool?", "BTW, the phrase someone mentioned above is actually \u201cNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity\u201d.\n\nIt's stupidity, not ignorance.  Not realizing that immigrants who've been in this country for decades and work at the same company as her would obviously speak English is not exactly peak smarts. lol\n\nNot a dealbreaker, but ... oof.", "> These statistics mention census answers, but those would reflect more traditional, proper fluency.\n\nThe question they asked was \"Do you speak English\" - it didn't specify level of fluency.  But I get what you're saying that people might answer no even if they had enough fluency to get by in casual situations.  \n\nI do have experience working in India, where I was the supervisor and hired subcontractors with various levels of English fluency, and do get a sense for what you're saying about how people can get by when they need to.    It was also interesting for me to learn that Hindi is far from universal - my colleague from South India used English to speak to the local Marathi labour as well (with the same level of understanding, or not, that I had as a Westerner).  I understand that the Marathi guys spoke Hindi, but my colleague from Kerala was quite bad at it, so they worked out that English was better for both.", "you girlfriend is stupid. shes a stupid person", "I must have not fully woken!\nI read that as \"In that case very much TA\".\n\nMy bad \ud83d\ude02", "Have you ever met an American teenager?", "I doubt many Americans are aware that English is the official language for India. \n\nDespite being literally the largest democracy in the world and once being the richest region in the world, India doesn't feature in most history, geography or political science class.", "No, her parents and my parents both work at the same company, and took us to a company family event, where we met.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Yea, I've said stupid offensive stuff before.  I was horribly embarrassed and it still haunts me when I go through  my \"let's remember every stupid embarrassing moment of my life!\" moments. I also learned from it and didn't say stupid shit like that again.  Ugh I still remember making a shitty comment about gay people in 9th grade coming from a rural area where that was normal to a very liberal school in the city.  I was such an asshole.", "So the GF is dumb or malicious - not a great choice between imho ;).", "Actually, yes.   \nIt was years ago and those were students on one of our universities (I don't recall now, if it was an exchange program or they just were taking courses there).   \nThey seemed quite enlighted and educated for me, but maybe I just met some \"nerdy\" ones ;)", "As I said, there ethnicity specific businesses.  Those businesses are not typically white color.  Yes, you can live in a neighborhood with a high population of one ethnicity and get by, but you likely aren't working at a white collar job.  There are expat communities in other countries specifically associated with international business and white collar jobs.", "Are\u2026are you gatekeeping racism? Also, can you not read? Like, did you read the first sentence of my comment and then just rage respond? Racism doesn\u2019t require malice\u2026I\u2019m not passing judgement on you by saying that judging another person by the color of their skin is racism, that is straight, objective fact. There\u2019s no opinion here. It\u2019s just a fact. Judging someone by the color of their skin, no matter the reason, is racist. It\u2019s what the word literally means.", "For what it's worth, I came from a family where inability to take criticism was the norm, and what I learned as the usual response to criticism. I think maybe one or two people in my first job did try to talk to me about being defensive (or some sort of words to that effect), but I honestly didn't understand what they were talking about or what it was that I did that other people didn't or didn't expect. (Because as a junior, more senior people don't get criticised in front of you. The only examples I had were my family even then). It wasn't until someone at my second job said something like, \"Why can't you take correction? Why don't you just say, 'Really? I didn't know that!' or 'I never thought of it like that' or something?\" that I started to grasp what the problem was and what different things I could do instead.", "You got a racist white with massive unconscious bias and an ability to open their mind to feedback. \n\nWhat are you doing with her?", "Oh, have fun with that,", "That\u2019s not a flaw, that\u2019s a character trait.  Flaws can be recognized & corrected.  Character traits are exactly that, part of a persons character.  The assumption without logic was simply ignorant.  The inability to accept criticism or responsibility is ingrained & will be an issue in all aspects of your relationship, for the duration of your relationship.", "You met the ones that actually had a decent enough education to find where other countries are on a map and have the means to visit them. Education is so lacking in the US, my own sister couldnt find Norway on a map and she both graduated HS and College. Encountering a young American who assumes Brown people dont speak English is actally quite common.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Honestly the geography aside it\u2019s the questions like \u201cdo they have cars in your country\u201d that I find the weirdest", "What are you even arguing with me about?  I thought we were talking about speaking your native language in expat communities and the difference between the US and communities in other countries.  Where did I even mention racism?", "Oooookayy. Not touching this with a 10 foot pole. I am definitely not going to discuss the racial climate in America with you, ain\u2019t no way lol, you have some wildly out of pocket takes.", "OK, my bad, train of thought extended from other argument.  Shouldn't be debating multiple things at once.", "Meh, I'm done talking about it anyways.  I stand by what I said, north American view on Racism is so out of whack it's ridiculous."]}
