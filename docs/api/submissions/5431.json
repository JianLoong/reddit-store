Ellie has 2 kids (f6, m4) and we get along really well.\n\nI have a big family and it's pretty much impossible to have one Christmas event and expect everyone to make it, so my parents host their celebration the week before. My mom has a tradition with the 'kids' (us) where she gives mini snow globes.\n\nThe event was last Saturday, and as usual mom pulled us aside and gave us this year's snow globes.\n\nNow the snow globe giving extends to partners and I was expecting Ellie and the kids to receive one. My brother's wife Jane (f27-28) was there and mom gave her and her 5 yo daughter snow globes. Mom's reasoning is that she doesn't know Ellie well enough to be included, but I said being my partner should be enough and she should've at least included the kids. Ellie came to the event with me and she was upset when she saw mom didn't get one for her or the kids.\n\nI got kind of annoyed and told mom she gets snow globes for Jane and her daughter, considering my brother wasn't her son (we're half brothers). If that's the case then she's excluding Ellie for no reason. \n\nMom got defensive and started getting mad, and we ended up leaving early.\n\nI just don't think what mom did was right, these aren't expensive and she could've got 3 more so Ellie and the kids could be included. I'd get if it was just for us, but she gets them for partners and kids too. I got a few texts later from my sister, saying I'm creating issues and we disrespected my parents and Jane, and should apologize.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671768163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt5vfy/aita_for_calling_out_my_mom_after_she_excluded_my/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First of all, this isn't demanding a gift, it's asking not to be excluded. OP said these aren't expensive snow globes. It's not the actual item, rather the meaning behind it that makes it special. OP isn't asking his mom to buy his girlfriend a $5000 Chanel bag, but including her and her kids in their cute, inexpensive tradition.\n\nSome people spend decades without getting married. Some people divorce in months. Maybe OP sees a future with Ellie? But there are families that value marriage over all else, as seen with Jane and her daughter vs Ellie and her kids.\n\nI think OP is kind of an AH too because he was being dramatic at a family event and could've talked to his mom later, but I do get where he's coming from.", "While it's up to OP's parents. I'm going to go with NTA. Ellie and her kids may not be family, but you dont invite people over, especially kids, and give every kid something and exclude two kids and have those two kids watch it all happen. If this is about the christmas spirit, you should want to include all participants in the event. Maybe OP's parents should have given a heads up to him. This way he could have prepared the kids. But, it's really a shitty feeling, as a kid, to watch others get something, while you get nothing. I, as a kid, watched my mom's friend bring my mom a gift, my younger sister a gift, and me nothing. To sit there and watch them open their gifts and wonder why I was excluded. It hurt. I can sympathize.", "NTA \u2026 it\u2019s Christmas and if you (your mum) invites all the family over for the little tradition \u2026.she would have know you were being your partner and children\u2026 then you include everyone that is there in your tradition, otherwise don\u2019t invite the people you don\u2019t want included. \n\nYour mother has forever changed the way the snow globe tradition will continue. From my reading into this I would not show up next year for the snow globe giving, start your own little family tradition and show up either later or another day. \n\nLittle Children do not understand adult reasons as to why they are not receiving a snow globe. All the kids would have wanted was a snow globe.", "I am going against the grain here and say NTA if your girlfriend was invited. If she was invited, snow globes should have at least been given to the kids to not exclude them.

Go apologize to your mother!", "YTA. your mother gets snow gloves for people in her family. \n\nSomeone you have dated for less than a year (with a suspicious age gap) does not compare to your late brothers wife of 5 years and his daughter. \n\nYour mother got your girlfriend and the kids chocolates so it\u2019s not like they had nothing. \n\nThis is your mothers tradition, and who is included is decided by her. \n\nIn the way that you have acted at this occasion (by talking bad about your late brother) don\u2019t be surprised if you aren\u2019t included in next years tradition. How dare you say that your brother wasn\u2019t your mothers son? Biology isn\u2019t the only thing that makes you parent & child.", "OK, I know this is a minority opinion here, but NTA.  I have issues with using Christmas, Thanksgiving, weddings, baby showers et al as occasions to hurt others.  Especially kids.  If the mom's tradition was to give everyone a hand-knit cashmere sweater or a new computer, it would have made sense to get something different for the GF and her kids.  But these were snow globes which the OP describes as inexpensive.  Cool, small, inexpensive items that are much cooler for children than, say, chocolates.   And the GF's kids saw everyone else, including Jane's children, getting them.  Yeah, life is hard and unfair and blabittyblah, but why not buy the GF's kids a couple of inexpensive snow-globes as opposed to knowingly, intentionally disappointing them for Christmas?  The OP's mom could have been nice to these kids; she wasn't.   The OP gets to be upset on the kids' behalf.", "I'm going to go with NTA. I don't understand why Reddit is obsessed with age gaps and timelines. People can be together for 10 years and still not know if they want to be together and others can meet someone and know within a month that that's their person. \n\nIt's not like OPs mom is giving out family heirlooms. It wouldn't have cost her anything to include OPs gf and her kids in the tradition.

Every relationship is different and sometimes its harder to track long term/serious status these days but until your either living with someone or been together long enough (I don't know 5+ years?) To show that the partner is as serious/equal its not unreasonable to treat new relationships differently. My youngest sister has been with her bf for less than 2 years and do not live together, you can bet my mum treats him differently to her DIL & SIL.\nThe fact that you then kicked up a fuss over a family tradition that your gf had no part of is just icing on the AH cake, especially when it sounds you mother didn't exactly falunt the snowglobes to everyone.\n\nAlso are we just glossing over the age difference? If sexes were reversed we would be screaming he's a predator. I get it I've dated older women before but an 9 year age gap seems excessive at such a young age, especially when the mother has 2 kids. It's clear you are both going to be at very different stages of your lives. The fact that your gf is expecting DIL level relationship with your mum is worrying. \nPredatory behaviour works both ways.", "YTA. Your age gap is showing.

And you\u2019re clearly too young to realise how inappropriate her response was. \n\nAnd, worst of all, you\u2019re a massive, heartless AH to bring your brother\u2019s WIDOW and child into this.\n\nYou didn\u2019t call anyone out. You showed yourself and your girlfriend up.", "YTA.\n\nINFO: is this y\u2019all\u2019s first Christmas together?!?\n\nI had to stand awkwardly off to the side for the family photo (just family and spouses) as well as gift exchange (just spouses and family) for 2 christmases. \n\nLarge family traditions are not just thrown around.", "YTA", "YTA. There's a huge difference between wife and a girlfriend of less than a year.

However, I can be wrong, afterall i don't know your familly", "NTA", "NAH. It\u2019s her tradition and she can carry it on however she likes.

Also how many times have she actually met your girlfriend? You've only been dating for a year so it's possible she's only met her once maybe twice. Why would I buy something that's family specific for somebody that I've met once? And the kids weren't even there.", "YTA for the same reason everyone else said. Spouse v dating partner is a very normal line that parents draw when considering inclusivity for their children. Your mom clearly takes the snow globes seriously and holds them dear to her heart. So it makes sense that she doesn\u2019t want to give them to a random woman and her kids when there\u2019s a possibility that a new woman (and maybe her kids) would be around next year. That takes away from some of the meaning of them. YTA for creating a scene, apologize to your mom", "Come onnnnn that woman is way too old for you.", "YTA. You do not get to dictate the terms of someone else's gift giving. If it's that important that Ellie and her kids get snow globes, go buy them snow globes. But do not presume to tell your mother that she should buy and give presents based on your wants and desires. That would be selfish and arrogant.", "YTA. A girlfriend is different from a wife or a stepchild. You should have probably offered to cough up cash for the three as snow globes aren\u2019t usually cheap. Around here they are about 10-40 dollars.\n\n\nYou\u2019re also a bigger asshole if the kids weren\u2019t even present", "YTA. Your mum gave your brother's widow and his bereaved children snow globes. Those people are members of her family. She gave your girlfriend of less than a year chocolates, which is a kind gift for your son's recent girlfriend.", "YTA\n\n And a stupid one at that, Why are you in a relationship with a women with two children who is eight years older than you? And then trying to force your parents to treat them as they treat the rest of your family.\n\nYour mother is probably sad that you're wasting your life.", "-Kids weren\u2019t even there.\n\n-Your mom gave them chocolates as a substitute.\n\n-Your mom pointed out that you had only been dating for not even a year and she didn\u2019t feel comfortable including them in the tradition but still made sure they weren\u2019t empty handed.\n\n-You responded to your mom by saying your dead brother wasn\u2019t really her son and that his widow and now fatherless child therefore have no right to be included in the tradition if your gf of around 9-10 months who is 10 years older than you with kids isn\u2019t.\n\n-And just to repeat, your dead brother was married to his wife for 5 years (who knows how long they dated) before he died 2 years ago!!! Your sister in law has been in this families life for at least 8 years allowing for one year dating minimum and your response to your mom not knowing your gf well enough was to invalidate your widowed sister in laws connection by saying your dead brother wasn\u2019t even part of your family.\n\nDude, YTA, more than most people you are TA.", "YTA her being your partner is INSIGNIFICANT, IT DOESNT MATTER PERIOD. Your mum CLEARLY got those snow glibes for those who she has a decent RELATIONSHIP with. You are SOOO the asshole", "YTA\n\ndude you have been dating this woman only a year and you are holding her at the same level as your brother, his wife and kid, who are all family? it doesnt matter whether you are half brothers or not.", "YTA I can\u2019t imagine expecting my family to include a girlfriend/boyfriend whom I have dated for less than a year and that they don\u2019t know very well in this type of family tradition. I would maybe feel differently about the kids being excluded if they had A. Not gotten anything and B. Actually been present but they weren\u2019t so it\u2019s an issue of your girlfriend feeling slighted which just isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s also very normal, at least in family\u2019s that I know, for partners not to be included in things like this until they\u2019re married or together for a certain number of years. You\u2019re a huge asshole for the dig about your brother not being your mother\u2019s biological child and I have to question what the hell a 31 year old mother of two wants with somebody so immature (but then I remembered she\u2019s also upset over this so it seems like maybe she too is an adult child)", "I'd say NTA, and it's days like this I never understand Reddit.\n\nI mean as others on here have said of course it's her right to decide she's free to exclude whoever she likes but make no mistake she's being an AH here to show her disapproval of your relationship. Like some snow globes would be a very small and easy thing to get, the only reason not to would be to make a point that she's unhappy about your choices. And she's doing it in a very manipulative way.\n\nOf course Reddit is usually lined up to scream \"fuck you mum and dad I'll do what I want!\" given even most adults on here are still children but for some reason they've gone a different way today!\n\nOnly thing I'd take as an excuse was that she didn't know they were coming till the last minute and couldn't order the things in time, in which case an alternative gift would be appropriate. Otherwise she's just being passive aggressive about your relationship and I think that would qualify as an AH move considering she's free to just speak to you about it.", "First gf huh? No wonder your going so hard for her. 31 with 2 kids you really know how to choose em at 23.", "Wait, wait, WAIT! The brother is dead? So you harp on not giving a widow and the child a small token? Wow. AH. \n\nAlso, from my standpoint, the last thing I want are a bunch of tiny, cheesy snow globes from my BF's mom.", "My first thought was about the age gap. I doubt mom is happy about that", "This reminds me of the post where a gf was meeting her bf\u2019s parents for the first time and told her son to call them grandma and grandpa. Why do people think that because they\u2019re dating someone for a short time they should be included in all family traditions?", "Also, not just his brothers wife, his brothers *widow*", "Yikes I had no idea.  It\u2019s what I use.  It just feels bizarre to call a 37 yo man my \u201cboy\u201dfriend.  And I\u2019m no girl either, I\u2019m a damn woman.  I like how it emphasizes our equality too.  What other terms are there for us to choose from?  Not being cheeky it\u2019s a genuine question.", "Oh man this, I\u2019m single 36f with a 14 yr old. Couldn\u2019t imagine dating someone 23", "As a 30 year old on online dating, i won't even look at anyone under 25. And don't really starting considering things until at least 27. This is so weird to me.", "If it was a man dating a woman that age everyone would be going crazy.", "According to OP in the comments the kids weren't even there. They were with their dad.", "INFO and how do you classify \u201calmost a year?\u201d Like 9 months? 11.5 months?", "Yea the gap is creepy...especially since op is so young", "It doesn\u2019t mean the same thing, they\u2019re just saying that a lot of people treat the word partner or relationship very casually and like their new or casual one is equal to someone else\u2019s long term, serious, and committed relationship. Partner is a completely fine term to use.", "23 year old me had no interest in dating someone over 30, and 30 year old me had no interest in dating someone college aged. Big no all around.", "Now imagine dating someone that turned 18 the same year your 6 yo kid turned 1. Just not old enough to take care of a kid.", "Why are you dating someone who can\u2019t understand she\u2019s not entitled to gifts, especially considering you just started dating. Is she always acting like that? Isn\u2019t this entitlement worrying you?", "She\u2019s 31 for god sake. That\u2019s way way way tool old to cry over a Christmas present. Who expects a present from people they met less than a year ago\u2026", "Why do you expect them to be included in a tradition that they didn't even attend?", "So the kids were not there and were not excluded, the gf of less than a year wanted the same treatment as your brothers wife?\n\nINFO: how often do your parents see your gf and her kids? Do you guys meet a couple of times per month and hang out? Because less than a year and only met 3 times does not make her family. If those meetings were when those kids were at their fathers, what would you expect? Your mom got them something, just not the family tradition gift which is because they are not family yet. I'm sure if you invest into the relationship of your gf and her kids with your parents it will change. So YTA tendency here, unless I'm wrong and you had biweekly dinners all year", "There\u2019s a reason no one who is Ellie\u2019s age will date her. Kids become less of an issue the older you get. The reaction to not getting a snow globe is telling. OP run and find someone closer to your age.", "Especially since he was a minor when her daughter was born.", "Yep, it might be perfectly legal but it's creepy. \n\nOP isn't an adult long enough for his mom to not be worried at least a little. \n\nOn top of the age gap, they are also in different stages of their lives. She has kids, he has not which can lead to problems even in same age couples.", "This changes everything and ahould have been included in the main post", "I used to be in poly circles and I feel like partner\u2019s kind of a catchall. When people say partner, they could mean their primary partner they live with and prioritize and are deeply committed to or they could mean like a play partner that they see once a year and have sex with and not a deep emotional relationship.", "The kids weren\u2019t there so there was nothing to discuss with them beforehand. And OP\u2019s brother passed away 2 years ago, leaving his widow Jane and a daughter. They were married for 5 years before he passed and Jane is family. OP had been with his gf for less than a year and his mom said she doesn\u2019t know her well. You cannot compare the two situations.", "\u201cwe get along really well\u201d, as OP\u2019s main description of his relationship with Ellie, doesn\u2019t make it sound like he sees her and her kids as family yet. What I see is a kid who\u2019s standing on his entitlements, and also someone who\u2019s trying to deflect his upset girlfriend (whose expectations also got ahead of things).", "The kids weren\u2019t there.", "Yeah that\u2019s how I view it as well", "Totally missed the kids not being there\u2026changing my NAH to YTA", "Oh my god YTA, what were you thinking.", "Why to tell your dead brother widow you don\u2019t really see her or your brothers kids as family. YTA. I\u2019d try to make it work with this gf. At the rate you\u2019re going she\u2019s going to be the only family that wants to hang out with you", "Wow. YTA", "YTA", "What the fuck, man??? YTA.", ">what were you thinking\n\nHe wasn't"]}
