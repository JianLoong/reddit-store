Ellie has 2 kids (f6, m4) and we get along really well.\n\nI have a big family and it's pretty much impossible to have one Christmas event and expect everyone to make it, so my parents host their celebration the week before. My mom has a tradition with the 'kids' (us) where she gives mini snow globes.\n\nThe event was last Saturday, and as usual mom pulled us aside and gave us this year's snow globes.\n\nNow the snow globe giving extends to partners and I was expecting Ellie and the kids to receive one. My brother's wife Jane (f27-28) was there and mom gave her and her 5 yo daughter snow globes. Mom's reasoning is that she doesn't know Ellie well enough to be included, but I said being my partner should be enough and she should've at least included the kids. Ellie came to the event with me and she was upset when she saw mom didn't get one for her or the kids.\n\nI got kind of annoyed and told mom she gets snow globes for Jane and her daughter, considering my brother wasn't her son (we're half brothers). If that's the case then she's excluding Ellie for no reason. \n\nMom got defensive and started getting mad, and we ended up leaving early.\n\nI just don't think what mom did was right, these aren't expensive and she could've got 3 more so Ellie and the kids could be included. I'd get if it was just for us, but she gets them for partners and kids too.

First of all, this isn't demanding a gift, it's asking not to be excluded. OP said these aren't expensive snow globes. It's not the actual item, rather the meaning behind it that makes it special. OP isn't asking his mom to buy his girlfriend a $5000 Chanel bag, but including her and her kids in their cute, inexpensive tradition.\n\nSome people spend decades without getting married. Some people divorce in months. Maybe OP sees a future with Ellie? But there are families that value marriage over all else, as seen with Jane and her daughter vs Ellie and her kids.\n\nI think OP is kind of an AH too because he was being dramatic at a family event and could've talked to his mom later, but I do get where he's coming from.", "While it's up to OP's parents. I'm going to go with NTA. Ellie and her kids may not be family, but you dont invite people over, especially kids, and give every kid something and exclude two kids and have those two kids watch it all happen. If this is about the christmas spirit, you should want to include all participants in the event. Maybe OP's parents should have given a heads up to him. This way he could have prepared the kids. But, it's really a shitty feeling, as a kid, to watch others get something, while you get nothing. I, as a kid, watched my mom's friend bring my mom a gift, my younger sister a gift, and me nothing. To sit there and watch them open their gifts and wonder why I was excluded. It hurt. I can sympathize.", "NTA \u2026 it\u2019s Christmas and if you (your mum) invites all the family over for the little tradition \u2026.she would have know you were being your partner and children\u2026 then you include everyone that is there in your tradition, otherwise don\u2019t invite the people you don\u2019t want included. \n\nYour mother has forever changed the way the snow globe tradition will continue. From my reading into this I would not show up next year for the snow globe giving, start your own little family tradition and show up either later or another day. \n\nLittle Children do not understand adult reasons as to why they are not receiving a snow globe. All the kids would have wanted was a snow globe.", "I am going against the grain here and say NTA if your girlfriend was invited.

Grow up little kid and do better than this. You are embarrassing yourself.", "YTA\n\nLess than a year? And you're comparing her to your brother's widow??? Boy, you have no idea what a long term relationship is yet. You've got a great deal of growing up to do. Go apologize to your mother!", "YTA. your mother gets snow gloves for people in her family. \n\nSomeone you have dated for less than a year (with a suspicious age gap) does not compare to your late brothers wife of 5 years and his daughter. \n\nYour mother got your girlfriend and the kids chocolates so it\u2019s not like they had nothing. \n\nThis is your mothers tradition, and who is included is decided by her. \n\nIn the way that you have acted at this occasion (by talking bad about your late brother) don\u2019t be surprised if you aren\u2019t included in next years tradition. How dare you say that your brother wasn\u2019t your mothers son? Biology isn\u2019t the only thing that makes you parent & child.", "OK, I know this is a minority opinion here, but NTA.  I have issues with using Christmas, Thanksgiving, weddings, baby showers et al as occasions to hurt others.  Especially kids.  If the mom's tradition was to give everyone a hand-knit cashmere sweater or a new computer, it would have made sense to get something different for the GF and her kids.  But these were snow globes which the OP describes as inexpensive.  Cool, small, inexpensive items that are much cooler for children than, say, chocolates.   And the GF's kids saw everyone else, including Jane's children, getting them.  Yeah, life is hard and unfair and blabittyblah, but why not buy the GF's kids a couple of inexpensive snow-globes as opposed to knowingly, intentionally disappointing them for Christmas?  The OP's mom could have been nice to these kids; she wasn't.   The OP gets to be upset on the kids' behalf.", "I'm going to go with NTA. I don't understand why Reddit is obsessed with age gaps and timelines. People can be together for 10 years and still not know if they want to be together and others can meet someone and know within a month that that's their person. \n\nIt's not like OPs mom is giving out family heirlooms. It wouldn't have cost her anything to include OPs gf and her kids in the tradition.

I would\u2019ve personally made sure everyone felt welcome and that includes extending the traditions regardless of how long you\u2019ve been together. Hell I\u2019d get some for the postman\u2019s kids if they were there. The kids are 4 and 6, give them a snow globe, it\u2019s Christmas! Apparently this makes me an asshole.", "Yikes I did too. It really makes the lack of relationship stability stand out even more. At 23 it\u2019s possible that this is OPs first long term relationship.", "That age gap is a yikes.", "OP states this is his Mom's tradition,  since it is her tradition she gets to decide when and if she decides to include in her tradition.

You are 23 so probably just learning that. But Ellie is 31 and a mom. She should have more manners and gift you some on the way.", "But the kids didn\u2019t come. And they did get something, just not a snow globe.", "You're going to fuck your family up. You cannot force a relationships. They're still getting to know her.

Your GF isn\u2019t. \n\nAgain, YTA.", "YTA \nYour expect long term partners (I.e. DIL) and legitimate grandchildren to be treated the same as someone who you have been with less than a year. Every relationship is different and sometimes its harder to track long term/serious status these days but until your either living with someone or been together long enough (I don't know 5+ years?) To show that the partner is as serious/equal its not unreasonable to treat new relationships differently. My youngest sister has been with her bf for less than 2 years and do not live together, you can bet my mum treats him differently to her DIL & SIL.\nThe fact that you then kicked up a fuss over a family tradition that your gf had no part of is just icing on the AH cake, especially when it sounds you mother didn't exactly falunt the snowglobes to everyone.\n\nAlso are we just glossing over the age difference? If sexes were reversed we would be screaming he's a predator. I get it I've dated older women before but an 9 year age gap seems excessive at such a young age, especially when the mother has 2 kids. It's clear you are both going to be at very different stages of your lives. The fact that your gf is expecting DIL level relationship with your mum is worrying. \nPredatory behaviour works both ways.", "YTA. Your age gap is showing.

What a terrible example for her kids and way to hurt them (when they weren\u2019t even there?!). And you\u2019re clearly too young to realise how inappropriate her response was. \n\nAnd, worst of all, you\u2019re a massive, heartless AH to bring your brother\u2019s WIDOW and child into this.\n\nYou didn\u2019t call anyone out. You showed yourself and your girlfriend up.", "YTA.\n\nINFO: is this y\u2019all\u2019s first Christmas together?!?\n\nI had to stand awkwardly off to the side for the family photo (just family and spouses) as well as gift exchange (just spouses and family) for 2 christmases. \n\nLarge family traditions are not just thrown around.", "YTA", "YTA. There's a huge difference between wife and a girlfriend of less than a year.

I wouldn't consider a partner like that part of the family either.", "NTA\n\nIt was rude to let your gf and her kids without anything, whilst everybody received.

However, I can be wrong, afterall i don't know your familly", "NTA", "NAH. It\u2019s her tradition and she can carry it on however she likes. I will say, that family traditions that exclude some people are pretty shit, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be a part of it.", "INFO Did your siblings\u2019 partners get snow globes when they just started dating?", "I think the mom was wrong. You include all your guests, you make them feel welcome! My parents/family have always welcomed everybody into their lives, and treated them like family. Best friends of my kids, my step kids. It\u2019s a celebration - let\u2019s do it up right", "The petty shit people quarrel over amazes me", "YTA. No question. And annoyed at dead brother's wife still being family? Far out", "Comparing what Jane gets to what Ellie gets is apples and oranges, as you\u2019ve been together less than a year this is Ellie\u2019s first Christmas with you. Jane has been part of the family and tradition a lot longer. \n\nINFO Did Jane get a globe the first Christmas her bother brought her home.", "YTA\nYou\u2019re ridiculous", "YTA. Your relationship hasn\u2019t even reached the one year mark. Get a grip.", "Yta. If you want your gf to be treated like a DIL, then propose. Otherwise, she gets treated like a gf. Also how many times have she actually met your girlfriend? You've only been dating for a year so it's possible she's only met her once maybe twice. Why would I buy something that's family specific for somebody that I've met once? And the kids weren't even there.", "YTA for the same reason everyone else said. Spouse v dating partner is a very normal line that parents draw when considering inclusivity for their children. Your mom clearly takes the snow globes seriously and holds them dear to her heart. So it makes sense that she doesn\u2019t want to give them to a random woman and her kids when there\u2019s a possibility that a new woman (and maybe her kids) would be around next year. That takes away from some of the meaning of them. YTA for creating a scene, apologize to your mom", "Come onnnnn that woman is way too old for you.", "YTA. You do not get to dictate the terms of someone else's gift giving. If it's that important that Ellie and her kids get snow globes, go buy them snow globes. But do not presume to tell your mother that she should buy and give presents based on your wants and desires. That would be selfish and arrogant.", "YTA. A girlfriend is different from a wife or a stepchild. You should have probably offered to cough up cash for the three as snow globes aren\u2019t usually cheap. Around here they are about 10-40 dollars.\n\n\nYou\u2019re also a bigger asshole if the kids weren\u2019t even present", "YTA. Your mum gave your brother's widow and his bereaved children snow globes. Those people are members of her family. She gave your girlfriend of less than a year chocolates, which is a kind gift for your son's recent girlfriend.", "YTA\n\n And a stupid one at that, Why are you in a relationship with a women with two children who is eight years older than you? And then trying to force your parents to treat them as they treat the rest of your family.\n\nYour mother is probably sad that you're wasting your life.", "-Kids weren\u2019t even there.\n\n-Your mom gave them chocolates as a substitute.\n\n-Your mom pointed out that you had only been dating for not even a year and she didn\u2019t feel comfortable including them in the tradition but still made sure they weren\u2019t empty handed.\n\n-You responded to your mom by saying your dead brother wasn\u2019t really her son and that his widow and now fatherless child therefore have no right to be included in the tradition if your gf of around 9-10 months who is 10 years older than you with kids isn\u2019t.\n\n-And just to repeat, your dead brother was married to his wife for 5 years (who knows how long they dated) before he died 2 years ago!!! Your sister in law has been in this families life for at least 8 years allowing for one year dating minimum and your response to your mom not knowing your gf well enough was to invalidate your widowed sister in laws connection by saying your dead brother wasn\u2019t even part of your family.\n\nDude, YTA, more than most people you are TA.", "YTA her being your partner is INSIGNIFICANT, IT DOESNT MATTER PERIOD. Your mum CLEARLY got those snow glibes for those who she has a decent RELATIONSHIP with. You are SOOO the asshole", "YTA\n\ndude you have been dating this woman only a year and you are holding her at the same level as your brother, his wife and kid, who are all family? it doesnt matter whether you are half brothers or not.", "YTA I can\u2019t imagine expecting my family to include a girlfriend/boyfriend whom I have dated for less than a year and that they don\u2019t know very well in this type of family tradition. I would maybe feel differently about the kids being excluded if they had A. Not gotten anything and B. Actually been present but they weren\u2019t so it\u2019s an issue of your girlfriend feeling slighted which just isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s also very normal, at least in family\u2019s that I know, for partners not to be included in things like this until they\u2019re married or together for a certain number of years. You\u2019re a huge asshole for the dig about your brother not being your mother\u2019s biological child and I have to question what the hell a 31 year old mother of two wants with somebody so immature (but then I remembered she\u2019s also upset over this so it seems like maybe she too is an adult child)", "I'd say NTA, and it's days like this I never understand Reddit.\n\nI mean as others on here have said of course it's her right to decide she's free to exclude whoever she likes but make no mistake she's being an AH here to show her disapproval of your relationship. Like some snow globes would be a very small and easy thing to get, the only reason not to would be to make a point that she's unhappy about your choices. And she's doing it in a very manipulative way.\n\nOf course Reddit is usually lined up to scream \"fuck you mum and dad I'll do what I want!\" given even most adults on here are still children but for some reason they've gone a different way today!\n\nOnly thing I'd take as an excuse was that she didn't know they were coming till the last minute and couldn't order the things in time, in which case an alternative gift would be appropriate. Otherwise she's just being passive aggressive about your relationship and I think that would qualify as an AH move considering she's free to just speak to you about it.", "First gf huh? No wonder your going so hard for her. 31 with 2 kids you really know how to choose em at 23.", "Wait, wait, WAIT! The brother is dead? So you harp on not giving a widow and the child a small token? Wow. AH. \n\nAlso, from my standpoint, the last thing I want are a bunch of tiny, cheesy snow globes from my BF's mom.", "My first thought was about the age gap. I doubt mom is happy about that", "This reminds me of the post where a gf was meeting her bf\u2019s parents for the first time and told her son to call them grandma and grandpa. Why do people think that because they\u2019re dating someone for a short time they should be included in all family traditions?", "Also, not just his brothers wife, his brothers *widow*", "Yikes I had no idea.

There\u2019s just as much room here for your girlfriend to have gotten wigged out about your mom treating her daughters like her grandkids. You kind of set her up for failure.", "YTA. Because you revealed in a comment your brother is Fucking DEAD.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend is not your married partner and her children aren\u2019t your mother\u2019s grandchildren. They clearly haven\u2019t reached the level of closeness in her view for this family tradition.

You guys have been dating for under a year, Jane is married into the family.", "YTA. Dating is not married.\n\nYou aren't even long term dating. Just dating.\n\nWives get treated different than girlfriends. Step kids get treated different than girlfriends kids. \n\nMarried is family.\n\nLong term dating, there's a line somewhere where everyone acknowledges you are a family, and it may be different for everyone - but it's never at less than a year of dating.", "As a mom,  GF'S and BF'S and their kids are not included in something that is a FAMILY event unless they are married, that's just the way it is.  Sorry you are hurt and mad by this but IMO you are the AH.  You are not married you are not engaged and her kids are not yours, she isn't family.", "YTA. You have a year with this girl and you want your mom to consider her children as grandchildren? if you were married it would be different but you need to calm down.", "YTA. The kids weren't even there & your girlfriend is being extremely entitled.", "YTA for not coordinating with your mother and managing your girlfriend\u2019s and her children\u2019s expectations in advance. You knew the logistics of the day and are throwing your mother under the bus for your thoughtlessness. Would it have been nice for your mother to have the foresight to get gifts for your guests to a family event? Yes. But it certainly sounds like she\u2019s a busy lady coordinating around all her children as it is\u2026 to the point she has a whole separate tradition established just to be able to have time with her grown children. \n\nIt was your responsibility to reach out to ensure it was appropriate to bring guests to a family event and to discuss how to include them.", "YTA She\u2019s not obligated to give one to your gf.

Buying a few extras is not with Christmas being ruined. You are not the Asshole. Anyone on here saying it\u2019s just your girlfriend\u2026nope.

And it was pretty shitty of you to throw your half brother under the bus too.    \nEllie is too old to be acting immature by getting upset she/her daughter wasn\u2019t included.

I just read through your comments because I felt there was something missing here and BOY, was I right....and people like you are the reason some of us hate Christmas. \n\nLet's review, shall we?\n\nThe kids WEREN'T EVEN THERE and your mother sent home some boxed chocolates for them.

Bringing out those flavors of entitlement and moving too fast!", "This. I wonder if OP breaks up with this girl, and dates another one with a kid, how quickly he'll expect THEM to be included in these traditions.

What would it have cost her to include rather than exclude?  OP is NTA.", "So young so dumb. By his logic he shouldn't care if his gfs kids got snow globes because they are not even his real kids.", "There is actually a big market for handmade, custom snowglobes. I did not know this until recently but I wouldn't be surprised if this was a similar tradition.", "I had 3 year old tomato pur\u00e9e until last week, wouldn't have given it a snow globe", "This was my thought too, she\u2019s a girlfriend. As a mom of sons, girls come and go frequently. My oldest changes women so much that I made a rule that she if anyone was dating under a year, they aren\u2019t allowed to come to Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t exclude any after that time nor their children but there has to be line somewhere as kids get older and start dating and marrying.", "At first read, I thought you were calling me young and dumb \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but yeah you\u2019re absolutely right on his logic!

But my position extends (to a lesser extent, since she's an adult and can handle this so much better than a  child could) to the GF.  Why not get her a damned inexpensive snow-globe like everyone else so she has no feelings of exclusion or of being less-than?", "I'm never coming to Christmas again until you apologize to the ketchup!!", "Oh my gosh! OP needs to take a step back from this whole situation. These aren't his kids. If they break up, he'll never see them again. The dad also seems to be active in their lives. OP is dating a much older woman with two kids and seems to want to take on the dad role, and have his parents take on the grandparents' role. I wonder if he realizes only he and the GF seem to want this.", "i\u2019d make a scrapbook of every single family photo with an ex she demanded be took, and give it to her.", "Reminds me of an episode in How I Met Your Mother when Ted brought a girl to Lilly\u2019s birthday party", "I\u2019m 28 and I have no interest in dating a 23 year old. That 5 years means a lot at this stage!", "Yta she's his widow are you seriously upset that your brothers wife and kids get a snow globe while your gf and her kids didnt. You guys haven't been together for that long. Your mom gave snow globes to family. Yes Jane is still family doesn't matter if he was your half brother. He was still family. You and Ellie should be happy that at least your mom gave ellie and the kids  some chocolates.", "Technically you could get married and have a kid with one in the oven and die in under a year.", "More like he was thinking with his other head lol.", "YTA. sounds like Janes kid has been around longer than a year.", "YTA!\n\nGetting along really well, is not the same thing as saying \"I see forever with this person.\" You've been with her for a year. Your brother is married to his wife. That's different. Your mom doesn't know this girl and she has the right to feel the way she does. Unless something changes, it sounds like she doesn't want to make any close ties with this woman, unless you show her otherwise. \n\nOh and shame on you for throwing it out there that your step brother is NOT her son. Yes he is! In her eyes he is! Your gf is nothing to her. If she's offended, too bad.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is not a part of your family. To your mom, she\u2019s not a daughter in law, she\u2019s just some random chick with kids that her son is dating. She probably thinks the age gap is weird, too.

Even worse if your mom invited you to bring them and then excluded them in front of the whole family.  How did she think your gfs kids would feel being left out?", "I remember that post! Bf wasn\u2019t in it for getting married and being a stepdad and the first time her kid met his parents she introduced them as \u201cGrandma and Grandpa\u201d, which caused bf to breakup right after.", "YTA. You sound like an immature idiot causing a fuss at a family event. You should be ashamed for saying what you did about your half-brother.

Jesus. I would die first before I exposed my entitlement like that.", "YTA.", "No- NTA", "YTA.

Do they call her grandma or spend time with her? \n\nSome people wait more than a year to let their kids meet new boyfriends. So expecting them to be included as family from your mom is a bit unreasonable. You could have asked ahead of time whether she was including them, and accepted her answer rather than putting her on the spot.

They even got chocolate gifts. Stop acting so entitled.", "Your relationship is less than a year old. Seeing as she started the tradition, your mom gets to decide who applies.

I have pantyhose older than your relationship. Your mom does this tradition for family. They aren\u2019t family.", "YTA.
