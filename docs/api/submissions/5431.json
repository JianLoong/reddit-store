Ellie has 2 kids (f6, m4) and we get along really well.\n\nI have a big family and it's pretty much impossible to have one Christmas event and expect everyone to make it, so my parents host their celebration the week before. My mom has a tradition with the 'kids' (us) where she gives mini snow globes.\n\nThe event was last Saturday, and as usual mom pulled us aside and gave us this year's snow globes.\n\nNow the snow globe giving extends to partners and I was expecting Ellie and the kids to receive one. My brother's wife Jane (f27-28) was there and mom gave her and her 5 yo daughter snow globes. Mom's reasoning is that she doesn't know Ellie well enough to be included, but I said being my partner should be enough and she should've at least included the kids. Ellie came to the event with me and she was upset when she saw mom didn't get one for her or the kids.\n\nI got kind of annoyed and told mom she gets snow globes for Jane and her daughter, considering my brother wasn't her son (we're half brothers). If that's the case then she's excluding Ellie for no reason. \n\nMom got defensive and started getting mad, and we ended up leaving early.\n\nI just don't think what mom did was right, these aren't expensive and she could've got 3 more so Ellie and the kids could be included. I'd get if it was just for us, but she gets them for partners and kids too. I got a few texts later from my sister, saying I'm creating issues and we disrespected my parents and Jane, and should apologize.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671768163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt5vfy/aita_for_calling_out_my_mom_after_she_excluded_my/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First of all, this isn't demanding a gift, it's asking not to be excluded. OP said these aren't expensive snow globes. It's not the actual item, rather the meaning behind it that makes it special. OP isn't asking his mom to buy his girlfriend a $5000 Chanel bag, but including her and her kids in their cute, inexpensive tradition.\n\nSome people spend decades without getting married. Some people divorce in months. Maybe OP sees a future with Ellie? But there are families that value marriage over all else, as seen with Jane and her daughter vs Ellie and her kids.\n\nI think OP is kind of an AH too because he was being dramatic at a family event and could've talked to his mom later, but I do get where he's coming from.", "While it's up to OP's parents. I'm going to go with NTA. Ellie and her kids may not be family, but you dont invite people over, especially kids, and give every kid something and exclude two kids and have those two kids watch it all happen. If this is about the christmas spirit, you should want to include all participants in the event. Maybe OP's parents should have given a heads up to him. This way he could have prepared the kids. But, it's really a shitty feeling, as a kid, to watch others get something, while you get nothing. I, as a kid, watched my mom's friend bring my mom a gift, my younger sister a gift, and me nothing. To sit there and watch them open their gifts and wonder why I was excluded. It hurt. I can sympathize.", "NTA \u2026 it\u2019s Christmas and if you (your mum) invites all the family over for the little tradition \u2026.she would have know you were being your partner and children\u2026 then you include everyone that is there in your tradition, otherwise don\u2019t invite the people you don\u2019t want included. \n\nYour mother has forever changed the way the snow globe tradition will continue. From my reading into this I would not show up next year for the snow globe giving, start your own little family tradition and show up either later or another day. \n\nLittle Children do not understand adult reasons as to why they are not receiving a snow globe. All the kids would have wanted was a snow globe.", "I am going against the grain here and say NTA if your girlfriend was invited. If she was invited, snow globes should have at least been given to the kids to not exclude them.

Go apologize to your mother!", "YTA. your mother gets snow gloves for people in her family. \n\nSomeone you have dated for less than a year (with a suspicious age gap) does not compare to your late brothers wife of 5 years and his daughter. \n\nYour mother got your girlfriend and the kids chocolates so it\u2019s not like they had nothing. \n\nThis is your mothers tradition, and who is included is decided by her. \n\nIn the way that you have acted at this occasion (by talking bad about your late brother) don\u2019t be surprised if you aren\u2019t included in next years tradition. How dare you say that your brother wasn\u2019t your mothers son? Biology isn\u2019t the only thing that makes you parent & child.", "OK, I know this is a minority opinion here, but NTA.  I have issues with using Christmas, Thanksgiving, weddings, baby showers et al as occasions to hurt others.  Especially kids.  If the mom's tradition was to give everyone a hand-knit cashmere sweater or a new computer, it would have made sense to get something different for the GF and her kids.  But these were snow globes which the OP describes as inexpensive.  Cool, small, inexpensive items that are much cooler for children than, say, chocolates.   And the GF's kids saw everyone else, including Jane's children, getting them.  Yeah, life is hard and unfair and blabittyblah, but why not buy the GF's kids a couple of inexpensive snow-globes as opposed to knowingly, intentionally disappointing them for Christmas?  The OP's mom could have been nice to these kids; she wasn't.   The OP gets to be upset on the kids' behalf.", "I'm going to go with NTA. I don't understand why Reddit is obsessed with age gaps and timelines. People can be together for 10 years and still not know if they want to be together and others can meet someone and know within a month that that's their person. \n\nIt's not like OPs mom is giving out family heirlooms. It wouldn't have cost her anything to include OPs gf and her kids in the tradition. Good on you OP for standing up for your partner.", "\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\r  \n\r  \n\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13  \n\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13", "ETAH in my opinion.

If it hurts so much you go buy the snow globes. \n\nApologize to your mother.", "YTA she\u2019s a girlfriend  you both are being entitled.", "Elle is in her thirties she should be more reasonable and not be hurt over something like this. Your Mom does her tradition for family. Elle and her Kids aren\u2019t family yet so they aren\u2019t included it\u2019s that simple.", "Yep. Go ahead and blow up the family for entitlement.
