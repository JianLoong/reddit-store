Ellie has 2 kids (f6, m4) and we get along really well.\n\nI have a big family and it's pretty much impossible to have one Christmas event and expect everyone to make it, so my parents host their celebration the week before. My mom has a tradition with the 'kids' (us) where she gives mini snow globes.\n\nThe event was last Saturday, and as usual mom pulled us aside and gave us this year's snow globes.\n\nNow the snow globe giving extends to partners and I was expecting Ellie and the kids to receive one. My brother's wife Jane (f27-28) was there and mom gave her and her 5 yo daughter snow globes. Mom's reasoning is that she doesn't know Ellie well enough to be included, but I said being my partner should be enough and she should've at least included the kids. Ellie came to the event with me and she was upset when she saw mom didn't get one for her or the kids.\n\nI got kind of annoyed and told mom she gets snow globes for Jane and her daughter, considering my brother wasn't her son (we're half brothers). If that's the case then she's excluding Ellie for no reason. \n\nMom got defensive and started getting mad, and we ended up leaving early.\n\nI just don't think what mom did was right, these aren't expensive and she could've got 3 more so Ellie and the kids could be included. I'd get if it was just for us, but she gets them for partners and kids too. I got a few texts later from my sister, saying I'm creating issues and we disrespected my parents and Jane, and should apologize.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671768163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt5vfy/aita_for_calling_out_my_mom_after_she_excluded_my/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Making that crack about your brother not really being her son was a low blow and does not make you look good.

Forcing it like you did this time will just make mom and the family dislike Ellie and her kids. And you.\n\nEdit: Just saw your comment that your brother has died, and Jane is a widow.

Either you are a welcoming family or you are exclusive. And it's OK to be exclusive but you don't get it both ways. If you are going to have children, any children, as one part of a holiday then they get to be in all parts of it. If her argument is that this is so special it can't be shared with anyone else then it needs to happen at a time when no one else has been invited.", "NTA (maybe E/S/H)\n\nStraight off I'm going to say you'll get a lot of Y/T/As, because people are going to say you're demanding gifts and you're not married to Ellie. First of all, this isn't demanding a gift, it's asking not to be excluded. OP said these aren't expensive snow globes. It's not the actual item, rather the meaning behind it that makes it special. OP isn't asking his mom to buy his girlfriend a $5000 Chanel bag, but including her and her kids in their cute, inexpensive tradition.\n\nSome people spend decades without getting married. Some people divorce in months. Maybe OP sees a future with Ellie? But there are families that value marriage over all else, as seen with Jane and her daughter vs Ellie and her kids.\n\nI think OP is kind of an AH too because he was being dramatic at a family event and could've talked to his mom later, but I do get where he's coming from.", "While it's up to OP's parents. I'm going to go with NTA. Ellie and her kids may not be family, but you dont invite people over, especially kids, and give every kid something and exclude two kids and have those two kids watch it all happen. If this is about the christmas spirit, you should want to include all participants in the event. Maybe OP's parents should have given a heads up to him. This way he could have prepared the kids. But, it's really a shitty feeling, as a kid, to watch others get something, while you get nothing. I, as a kid, watched my mom's friend bring my mom a gift, my younger sister a gift, and me nothing. To sit there and watch them open their gifts and wonder why I was excluded. It hurt. I can sympathize.", "NTA \u2026 it\u2019s Christmas and if you (your mum) invites all the family over for the little tradition \u2026.she would have know you were being your partner and children\u2026 then you include everyone that is there in your tradition, otherwise don\u2019t invite the people you don\u2019t want included. \n\nYour mother has forever changed the way the snow globe tradition will continue. From my reading into this I would not show up next year for the snow globe giving, start your own little family tradition and show up either later or another day. \n\nLittle Children do not understand adult reasons as to why they are not receiving a snow globe. All the kids would have wanted was a snow globe.", "I am going against the grain here and say NTA if your girlfriend was invited. If she was invited, snow globes should have at least been given to the kids to not exclude them. But YTA, if she wasn't invited and you just brought her and the kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have only been dating Eli for less 6 a year, so it's not even considered a long term relationship yet.\nBut, i also understand her kids are young and all they see are others getting pretty snow globs.

It's a rotten thing to do to little kids.\n\nBut if your mom didn't have fair warning that Ellie's kids were going to be there, then she can hardly be blamed for not having enough snow globes to go around. \n\nIf you did tell her that Ellie and the kids were going to be there, however, and she wasn't willing to include them in the festivities, then she really should have warned you of that ahead of time.
