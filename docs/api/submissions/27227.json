He laughed and said it was silly and joked about his sister being the one involved \"we all know how her engagement went.\" About finding out he said he didn't mind once he realized it was just a warning and a time line, he assures me very seriously while looking me in the eyes that his plan is rock solid, not even i could get to it. I promised i wouldn't try. About my cousin, he didnt mind she told him but didn't know why she would tell him over keeping the secret for me. \n\nNot sorry to disappoint, but the engagement is still on. In a very sweet way, he said the hardest part has been not being able to share the planning with me, but he is excited for the day and happy i am too. He is excited to see the dress and guessed the color correctly. \n\nI will keep an eye on the clenching thing tho, truly mean it, im glad it wasn't a big deal for him this time, but some comments really made me think about my actions and thats just not who i want to be.

ESH (except for your bf) for all this unnecessary drama.\n\nYou don't like surprises and you'd like to feel at least somewhat prepared and put together before the Moment for pictures. That's ok! Pictures will be taken that you're going to want to look back at later and you'd rather have pictures you feel you can smile at and not cringe over. That's perfectly fair and valid.\n\nWhat's *not* fair is the way you completely circumvented your bf to make sure the proposal was 100% enjoyable for you and and not *both* of you.\n\nYou could have very easily have communicated your feelings and preferences to your bf and agreed on some parameters for how this would go down if it's that important to you. Things like \"give me a heavy hint a few days beforehand\" ('hey baby, you should bring *that* dress with you this weekend ;) ') \"Let me know if it's going to be on a holiday\", \"Tell me when, but don't tell me where/what we'll be doing when you pop the question\", etc., etc. \n\nIt sounds like the surprise aspect was a big deal for your boyfriend, and you completely ruined that by scheming behind his back without even discussing it first to see if you could agree on some middle ground expectations to make sure you both had a memorable experience. If I were in his place I'd be feeling pretty hurt and also maybe a bit dumb and suddenly feeling like a pawn in my own plans while other people schemed circles around me. It might feel to him like you were trying to \"gotcha!\" him.\n\nHave a sit down. Apologize for the underhandedness, lay out your feelings about the proposal and *why* you want to feel prepared, and cut out all the middlemen. If you've picked a good one, he'll listen and respect your feelings and want to work with you to compromise on a proposal that makes you *both* overjoyed. If he pushes back or isn't willing to compromise, then you've got a different problem you'll need to address. \n\nEveryone else is TA for getting mixed up in this mess and playing you and your bf against each other.", "This whole thing is ridiculous.

Im F29, my boyfriend is M32 and his sister is F36, we have been together for almost 10 years\n\nI have a \"life plan\" engagement at the 10y mark, marriage at 12y and babies at the 14y mark. \n\nLast weekend his sister came to visit, she asked if i remembered our deal, i knew instantly what she was talking about, we only have one deal and its about our engagement. Like 5 years ago we talked and since she knows im a bit of a perfectionist and a control freak we agreed that she would let me know when it was officially going to happen, i didnt want to know any details, just the confirmation that it was on the horizon so i could take the appropriate measures. \n\nShe told me Its happening! Gave me a time frame (before the end of year) and we giggled and jumped of joy together. \n\nI knew i couldnt keep it in and wanted help/company with the shopping and other things, so i decided to tell my cousin, F30. Im an only child so she is not only my cousin i consider her my sister, also she is the person i had mentally chosen to be my MOH so i thought it was fitting. I wrote to her, said i had to tell her something important but it was a secret and i had to delete the message after she read it, when she was online i said; its happening he is proposing. The next day she writes back asking for more information, i said that i dont know anythings else just that is happening before the end of year. \n\nThe next day i get a call from my SIL asking did you talk to your cousin? I knew i f*cked up, she tells me that my boyfriend called her frantic telling her i knew everything, that the surprised was ruined and that my cousin had confirmed this. I felt so betrayed, i texted my cousin, said i was going to kill her and asked WHY DID YOU TELL HIM?, she got angry, said she didnt know. I explained that this was a deal i had with my SIL for her to let me know so i could prepare, she responded that she didnt aprove of that, that it was wrong and that she doesnt want to be involved in anything anymore, SIL later confirmed that there is a plan in place with a select few and she is one of them. \n\nMy cousin didnt apologize to me, nor did she explain, actually i am the one who apologized for telling her and the position that put her in. She didnt say anything else and kinda stoped talking to me. Im having a hard time understanding why she would do that, specially if she is part of a plan and i specifically told her i dont know details, i dont see a point more than to cause distress on my boyfriend. \n\nI told her because i thought that as \"my sister\"  i could share the preparation phase with her, that she could help me find my dress, and come with me to get my hair treatment (we go to the same place). I am very hurt by this, i ordered a beautiful dress for the engagement and did my treatment alone on my birthday. \n\nSo i ask AITA for having this deal with my SIL?, and /or for telling my cousin about it thinking we could enjoy it together?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Well, for starters i did a treatment on my hair that lasts a year so i dont have to worry if i have a hairstraightner that day to calm the crazies arround my forehead, i also started a discount thing for my nails where after the 5th apointment the 6th is free so i can always have them presentable, i ordered a dress that is very dreamy so it can arrive and be here available for when it happens. Stuff like that", "I have problems seeing how me know its happening over the next 4 months affects any side of the plan, i still dont know specifically when, where or how.

Thank u for your comment.", "For hair I did a treatment for the problem area that lasts a year, so i dont even have to think about it. Nails are a bit harder, but i found an offer where the 6th appointment is free, so im covered for the next 3 or so months. Im not wearing the dress as im being proposed to cause there's no way for me to know the exact date without spoiling the surprise, but since i ordered with time, it's highly likely it will arrive before the event so that i can put it on for pics, because i live outside the US it takes longer for packages to arrive so waiting till after to buy would mean more wait and probably not being able to wear it at the location he chooses, SIL knows to pick up the dress in case its a location thing, so i dont find out the exact date. \n\nActually thinking of a small wedding at my grandmas house with fam and close friends since most of my family and childhood friends live in other countries, and dont have the means to travel.", "This is true, probably would've saved myself all the drama if i talked to him directly or shut my mouth.

Im gonna think about the conversation you propose, i kinda dont want to meddle anymore and cause him to change plans since what i know (its coming) does not affect anything, and to the moment nothing has changed, i know this cause i talked to my SIL about if i should say something to him and she recommended that i didnt, she talked to him and explained in detail what our conversation was, answered all his questions and he decided that the plans should stan. I will repeat that i dont know what the plans are i only know its coming at some point in the next 4 months, and thats all i wanted, although i see now that i got that information the wrong way.

Worthy to mention that my SIL proposed this after her own engagement experience, and she was very careful in what she shared with me. It was basically its coming be ready. I should've talked to him about it, im sure he would've understood no problem, he is the one with the proposal dream, me not so much, so i guess i didnt cause i wanted him to have that thought of surprise, and is still very much a surprise in terms of where, exactly when and how.

But i see where you are coming from. With my cousin it hurts specially cause ive been the keeper of very serious secrets for her for many years, at times to my detriment to protect her. But i guess it doesnt go both ways. What im mostly struggling with is what was the purpose, cause i told her both times that i just knew it was coming, not even exactly when, so her telling him what she did and when she did feels intended to cause distress in him. About him backing out, it's not even an option, even after finding out all of this. We are both very sure and happy in our relationship, we both see marriage as a begining ceremony to start a family since we've been together for almost 10 years and already live together.

For example: yes, certainly you can plan for when you feel ready for babies. That doesn't mean that's what's going to happen!\n\nEase up on the rigidity, OP, but also learn when to be quiet! Until then, YTA on both counts.", "Why is this downvoted \ud83d\ude2d", "Then trust him to be amazing. You\u2019re setting these crazy expectations in your mind and while I\u2019m sure he knows you, does he know you\u2019re expecting a professional photo shoot to capture your actual engagement? I know that\u2019s popular but engagement photos with picture perfect hair and nails often come after the actual engagement. This is just one instance of all the ways you could be wrong about what to expect. And he\u2019ll notice when you let on that you had expectations to begin with.\n\nSaboteur of your own happiness.", "So for the next 3 months you are planning on being picture perfect all the time?\n\nAs a wise man once said, life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. You really should relax a little. Especially if you plan on having kids.", "This is about spending your life with someone you love. I get wanting to look nice, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn\u2019t matter at all. You\u2019ll have a lifetime of disasters and moments together in which you will be in various states of preparedness. It will also be a lifetime of being a partner to someone which means thinking of them just as much as you think of yourself. In this situation, it seems like your unrealistic expectations trumped consideration of your boyfriend. \n\nDo you want your life to be an instagram story or a love story?", "You still need to \"let go\" or \"unclench\" or whatever you call it.\n\nI see lots of anxiety in all this planning, preparation and needing to know.  We all have some anxiety in our lives.  Just don't let anxiety control you.  Your BF will appreciate your efforts in this regard.", "So why not plan the perfect proposal, exactly how you want it, and then propose to your boyfriend?", "> i could prepare meaning, taiming the wild hairs in my forehead, getting a dress for pictures, having my nails done so the pics that day dont show cracked nail polish.\n\nThere is a reason all this is called personal grooming. It doesn't need to be a group effort. You could have easily done that and kept your mouth shut.", "Okay.  I understand the hair and nail thing.  You going to wear that dress every time you see your SO?  How are you going to know when it is going to happen?\n\nI think part of the excitement is the surprise.  Seems you're taking all of that out of this.\n\nLive life as it happens.  Stop planning it so much and enjoy it as it unfolds.  It's not all about photo ops.", "Why couldn't you just talk to your bf about needing a heads up about an engagement?  Is there a reason he wouldn't tell you if you let him know it was important to you?  YTA for getting other people involved in this drama for no reason.", "My main point is your cousin probably freaked that you knew (SHE OBVIOUSLY KNEW BEFORE YOU) and told your bf/future Fianc\u00e9 in case he needed to amend his plans (4 month in the making).  It was not a hard YTA since you two are so close, but a secret is a secret.\n\nSeem this will be water under the bridge and he'll still come up with something special.  good luck", "How is her telling him any different than you telling her or the sil telling you? Youre an asshole here but imo the biggest asshole is the sil. She shouldn't have blabbed about the plans first and foremost. Doesn't matter if she promised you 5 years ago that she would cause I'm sure she also promised her brother she wouldn't say anything.", "You guys are both equally shitty.  She could have helped with your engagement without breaking her brother\u2019s trust.  \n\nAnd you can have gotten engaged without asking her to do it.", "I would still recommend having a talk just to clear the air and make sure there are no hurt feelings going forward, even if the \"plan\" hasn't changed at all. Relying on your SIL to relay your side accurately is still playing into the \"he said, she said\" games. *You're* the one in this relationship, not her, no matter how close they are. Don't pretend it never happened. Open the door, address the elephant in the room, have a laugh over the ridiculousness if you can, and then move on together. Communication is key here, as well as admitting \"boy did I mess this up. I'm sure sorry about that.\"\n\nI hope you end up getting a proposal that thrills you both right down to your toes!", "Trusting the wrong person didn't sabotage this. Your control issues sabotaged this. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's great that you've started to recognize that you were part of the problem here, but you're still putting a ton of this on your cousin. I get it. She went and blabbed and you didn't want that. But she wouldn't have done that if you didn't have this borderline pathological need to be in control of everything. \n\nSeriously, just calm down a bit and let life happen and it will be ok. It will be great! \n\nThis need to always know what's going to happen and be prepared is going to make your parenting years exponentially more stressful than they were already going to be.", "You know that it is coming because his sister told you and ruined the element of surprise. You're mad at your cousin and how that hurt your feelings, but you don't seem to care that your boyfriend is upset that someone spoiled the surprise that he was making plans to pop the question.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you don't know the details. You cared more about knowing it was coming than about how your boyfriend would feel that his sister took away that surprise from him. You care about yourself. You care about your life plan. You don't act like you care about your boyfriend beyond him being a game piece that fits into the Game of Life board you have set up for yourself.\n\nYou give an air of you're only into him for what he represents and what he can do for you, not for who he is. You act like you don't respect him or his privacy, and his sister certainly doesn't respect his privacy and confidences, thanks to you. That needs to change if you don't want to be viewed as the AH here, because that's exactly what you are right now.\n\nYou helped hurt your boyfriend, but you act like you're the wounded victim here.", "I don't understand the dress. Are you just going to carry it around with you and if you sense the moment is coming, hit pause so you can change? This all sounds like you want a photo op and not a genuine experience. Your poor boyfriend...", "I wonder why you see what you cousin did as unloyal to you. \nIf I were her and I was in on organising an engagement for you and suddenly you knew about it, I think I would consider it my duty to let your boyfriend know so he can decide when and how to do it and what he needs to change or not. \nOk she clearly got upset with you afterwards but before then I would have considered her telling your boyfriend as loyalty to you and your best engagement experience. No?", "You're ridiculous. Your poor boyfriend.", "Yea I mean you ruined you're husband proposal so you could feel in control and then tried taking it out on your cousin. Like obviously this was all your fault. Your cousin and boyfriend did nothing wrong.", "Because she's being snarky in response to a genuine criticism of her controlling behavior ruining things for her partner.", "I get where you are coming from. We've been together for almost 10 years, living together for 2, relationship is good and strong. He knows me and has seen me in all stages and states of everything, and i know we are ready. But i see what you say about expectations and consideration, i really did ruin this for him, cause of my need to know above him wanting to surprise me. Im being selfish.", "My intention is not to plan my proposal, i dont really have a proposal dream as much as him, which he has already shared with me in the past. What im trying to control here is how i present myself that day, it will be a picture day and i dont take many pics so i dont want to make the mistakes i see others make where the hair is wack and the nail polish is cracked on pics where the hands are in closeup. I want these pics for my picture wall so yeah i want to prepare myself.", "This is true. Silly me to think that i could share it with the person i usually share those types of things with and that supposedly has my back no matter what. Not to mention a person i hold so many secrets for that ive fought with hers and my own parents to protect her and what she hides. I guess its not the same for everyone. Lesson learned.", "This!\nI think OP is sucking all the fun, surprise and emotion from it by making it a red carpet event.\nFrom where I stand, it looks so shallow and fake.\n\nI actually feel sad for the guy who seemed to have big plans.", "Well, we live together so we see each other every day, the plan for the dress is to stay hanging until the day comes, planning to take it to every trip we go to in case it happens then, wont wear it until its official, then the dress comes on for pics. \n\nI dont really like surprises, they make me nervous, but ive accepted that i cant control the details of that ocation, so just the warning that its coming its enough for me to do what i need to do. \n\nIm not someone that takes many pictures, and i want the pics of that special moment to go on my picture wall so thats why im being such a perfectionist about how i present in them. But i will take your advice and live life as it happens, thank you for your comment.", "That is an amazing question, wish i had thought about it. Probably could have and just save myself all this drama of my own creation. Guess ill just wait till he proposes so i can spill and we can laugh together.", "I understand. But still, amend what? If i very clearly told her i dont know anything just that its happening, even after she asked for more specifics i said i cant tell you more cause i dont know more. If the plan was really at risked he wouldve told me himself, he would come home and tell me \"you wont let yourself be surprised you f*cking asshole\" but just the fact that he didnt lets me know his plans, whatever they are, are still on the way, and i still dont know what they are.", "Not sure i understand. By my knowledge she is still helping, probably more than before since cousin backed out. And honestly starting to think is better this way. For background the one to propose the deal was my SIL prompted by her own engagement experience, so we are still very excited.", "Wait you didn\u2019t know? Getting engaged means nothing now, it\u2019s all about that sweet sweet instagram content.", "Wondering that myself too since so many people have questioned it, realized what she did is not wrong, but it was against my interests, so i resent that she didn't prioritize me, even with the type of relationship we have. I mean, there is too much baggage for me to explain, and even then, i know for people it doesn't justify not doing the right thing.", "Nothing ruined, plan still on track on both sides cause i still get to prepare and he still gets to surprise me with the when, where and how. Thank you for your comment.", "Wouldn't the sister in law be to blame too? Like she's the one that originally told op. It doesn't really matter if they had a promise cause I'm sure the bf probably made the sister promise she wouldn't say anything.", "Trust me. When a baby vomits in your hair or you\u2019re changing his colonoscopy bag, you aren\u2019t going to care at all about how your nails looked when he proposed. He\u2019s not going to care how your hair looked in 10 years, but he will care about how you made him feel. \n\nIf it helps any, I made sure to get my nails done a few times I suspected the question might come up. When it actually happened? I asked \u201cwould you please grab my butt?\u201d two seconds beforehand, soooo\u2026 it will be perfectly imperfect just like I hope your lives together will be.", "You have some good insight into this.  Apologize to your BF and tell him that you are \"letting go\" of trying to control how your relationship goes.\n\nThis is a great learning experience that's happening before the wedding and having kids.  Better now than later.\n\nWe can be ready and open for something to happen, but we don't have control.  Life is imperfect and trying to make it \"perfect\" often leads to unnecessary trouble.  Practice imperfection!  The more we can accept imperfection in ourselves, the more we are able to extend forgiveness and grace to others.\n\nSeriously, this seems like anxiety posing as just wanting everything to go right.  If it is anxiety, do you know where it comes from?\n\nEnd of speech.  I wish you both the best and much future happiness!", "But you said you don\u2019t know what day he\u2019ll be proposing. Do you just plan to dress up every day?", "You can schedule engagement photos whenever you want.\n\nYou can take photos of hands that don't include nails.\n\nYou can be happy with messy hair.", "You are so focused on yourself with worry about stray hairs or cracked nails.\n\nI guess you'll have to wait until you are giving birth to focus on what is happening in the moment rather than how you look for photos.", "The less you try to control life, the more you will enjoy it.  There is no perfect and trying to attain it really sucks.\n\nAs the saying goes \"Man plans.  God laughs.\"", "Ffs can you not just enjoy the surprise when the proposal happens. Knowing this in advance making the event so unromantic. Your boyfriend is trying to make this proposal a special romantic surprise and you spoiled it because you are worrying your nails won\u2019t be perfect. I wonder if this because you want an \u201cinsta\u201d worthy event. \n\nYTA", "That\u2019s why you both are TAs", "Shit. I guess my low-key, living room engagement was invalid. I didn't have my nails done and I was wearing... sweatpants. And nobody even saw it happen and there are no photos.\n\nThanks for letting me know. Maybe I'll demand my husband give me a redo. It's only been 15 years!", "I get the feeling you\u2019re resentful of the fact that people don\u2019t \u201cprioritize you\u201d in every single situation. Having a victim complex must be exhausting.", "Surely your cousin no longer being in your proposal plan has changed the plan somewhat?", "Yeah the sister in law is also to blame, but that doesn't make OP any less to blame.\n\nShe's a selfish asshole more concerned with her engagement photos than whether or not she and her boyfriend are *actually* happy.\n\nRealistically she may need to see a therapist for this kind of need for control.", "She's going to be like the mom in Requiem for a Dream wandering around in her engagement dress rambling about being proposed to", "Not everyone likes surprises and for all you know being ready for it may make the moment more romantic for op. Esh no one should have told anyone, sister in law should've kept her mouth shut from the beginning. If op needed to know she should've spoken with her partner about it. Wanting to know and make sure you look good doesn't make someone an asshole. It's going behind someones back to try to find out information that makes someone an asshole.", "My husband proposed right after I walked out of the bathroom in our hallway\u2026 same situation here. Was it what a girl dreams of? No. But I married my best friend so literally who cares. \n\nYou and I should both go demand reparations! \ud83d\ude44", "Maybe, will have to wait till after so he tells me how the planning process happened and/or if anything changed. Will update!", "See a therapist because she wants to make sure she looks good in photos she'll look at forever? We can agree to disagree but op isn't an asshole for wanting to be prepared, lots of people don't like surprises especially about really big things. She's an asshole for spilling the beans. She should've spoken to her boyfriend about her feelings and wanting to be prepared. She's not trying to control how, when, or where he proposes. She is just trying to control how she looks when that happens. Wanting control over your hair and nails and what they look like at a big life event isn't something to see a therapist for.", "She feels the need to plan things so meticulously she has a year by year plan for any theoretical relationship she gets into. If you think those aren't control issues you're delusional.", "Having a life plan is normal. Plenty of people want to do things by a certain age. Lots of people have plans like be close to buying a house by x age or in y amount of years, have children or settle down by whenever. That's not abnormal or any sign of a control issue. It's called a life goal like finishing college then planning to get a PhD. Do you also think people that save a certain amount of money each month in order to have a specific amount to buy something life changing within a specific amount of time have control issues? It's normal to want a general plan for the future. She's not going \"I have to be proposed to on this exact date at this exact time and at this exact plate while we are doing this specific thing. Then exactly this many hours after I say yes we have to say I do then we have to take this many photos and all the guests have to let me choose exactly what they wear \" that would be control issues. Op just knows what she wants her life to look like and wants to work towards that together with her boyfriend."]}
