We make the same amount of money at my job so her not being able to afford a vehicle is not the issue she just chooses to waste her money. My dad and stepmom offered to let me move in with them and my stepmom offered me a great job that will really help with my future career that I am in school working on. My dad lives 2 and a half hours away so that means my cousin would have to find her own way to work and my friends who I have discussed this situation with have suggested Uber and or buses for her to get to work but Uber would be super expensive (we work 40/45 mins away) and there is no buses around where we live and work. When I brought up the situation of me moving my whole family is calling me inconsiderate for \u201cnot giving her a chance to find a vehicle\u201d although she has had MONTHS to do so. Pretty much my whole family is trying to make me feel bad because then she is going to have to quit her job. She has had as many chances as I have if not more to have a vehicle.
