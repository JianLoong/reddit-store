She was upset but I was upset too because in my eyes I get home she doesn't care about our well-being (since she gets home at 2:30) then she goes of without feeding our child to the gym, and if you remember, she had already gone to in the morning anyways.

This behavior seems pretty bizarre!", "NTA she should drive herself, or better yet walk / jog / bike ride as it's so close and inconveniences the whole family if she doesn't.", "NTA.  And she's probably cheating on you", "NTA. Does she have a reason for driving?", "NTA\nI would be asking why she wants to be at the gym so much. This isn\u2019t healthy if she is that obsessed with fitness.", "Good for you for prioritizing your child.  I think you need to plan some really fun things to do with your daughter on weekends so you're both not home when your wife gets home from the gym in the evening.  Don't prepare food for her either.  She needs a reality check more than you not driving her back and forth.  \n\nAs others have said, something weird is going on here.  Maybe you should mention going and working out with her, not because you really will but to see what her reaction is...  Is she meeting someone there?  This amount of time at the gym seems excessive.", "7-minute drive is also known as a \"warm up for gym/ride your bike.\" \n\nFor example: my workplace is 3.3 km from my house. If I ride my bike at a reasonable pace, it takes me 12 minutes, and I cut through the park. If I drive and catch all the traffic lights, it takes 13 minutes, as I have to go around. \n\nNTA, buy her a belated Christmas present: a push bike.", "NTA. Does she want to spend time together with you and your daughter? Does she like being a mom? Are there stresses in her life leading to this type of behaviour - I wouldn't call it obsessive but avoidant? She is avoiding being home with you and her daughter. Her insisting you driving her feels almost like a test to see how supportive you can be, because if you don't drive her, you can be the cause of why she isn't exercising and why she isn't happy. \n\nYou sound like you are doing most, if not all, of the household chores and childcare  - that is unfair and exhausting for you, and for your daughter. \n\nFor the record, my mom was a marathon runner (lots of hours needed for training) who ran in the morning before we got up, on her lunch hours, or when we were asleep as little kids. I don't ever remember her not being present for our childhood, in fact, it was the opposite. As we got older, we'd go running together or I'd bike beside her for her long runs. It became a family affair to support my mom and her competitions, but with healthy boundaries. I know, as a mom now myself, how we all need some alone time, but it makes me sad to think you and your daughter are not having quality time with your wife.", "Why is it a thing that you drive her to the gym to begin with? She has her own car, why does she want you to drive her? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Is there a chance your wife has a history of an eating disorder or OCD? Or is having an affair? There's something weirdly compulsive about what she's doing. At a minimum she needs to start driving herself period. And really, I think it's marriage counseling time.", "What if she biked or roller bladed - the round trip would be like an extra leg dsy every day and then she might not \"need\" to go twice a day...", "I refuse to drive because the inconvenience of it, I am more worried about feeding my daughter than taking her to a gym she already drove herself to in the morning. I didn't think of the possibility of her wanting to be driven because she would be tired, I think that might be it, honestly did not realize that. I will continue to drive her, now I feel bad she's probably tired and doesn't want to drive. But I still think she shouldn't go twice a day if she's this tired to be driving.", "NTA I'm not gonna go the cheating route because she probably wouldn't want you to drive her there constantly. She sounds like she may have developed a disorder or been had it and it's just manifesting. Nothing wrong with exercise but becoming hostile and doing it to the point where you neglect your family is a problem and grounds for a serious discussion.", "Haha I know it's what I tell her jogging would be good exercise as well, it like 10 minutes on bike it's not far at all.", "It does make me wonder but why would she want me to drive her if she's cheating. All in all it's super weird and has actually made me question things.", "That doesn't really make sense since the whole reason she is upset is because he won't drive her. I realize there could be someone at the gym but, in that case, wouldn't she want to drive herself? I feel like cheating is a huge reach here.", "She hasn't given me a reason she literally drives farther to work than to the gym. But gets mad when I don't and insist that I do.", "Recently she has been more fitness oriented and now its almost all she talks about, there's worse things to be obsessed with I guess, but since everyone in her gyme class are equally obsessed i write it off. I have asked her and she responded that it's an outlet for her anxiety and it's healthy options for her to make her feel good about herself.", "I've told her that it's fine that she works on herself but giving time to her daughter is equally as important, we made a decision to be parents and although I agree we should have time for ourselves I feel that every morning for and hour and 2 more in afternoon is enough. On weekends we do try to go out as a family she's always tired though so she's not even present, we went to watch Wonka (daughter was happy and I was too) and she was sleeping throughout the movie. The thing I don't understand is that she has invited me to go but I have refused because someone has to take care of our kid, the people at the gym have invited me but they seem like assholes because they shame my wife for eating a burger, I don't like them at all.", "I checked on maps and you are absolutely right, 6 minute drive 10 minute bike ride. Bike might be the answer.", "She does say she wants to spend time but I honestly do see the effort, we go to the movies and shes tired so she sleeps we want to go to the jumping place but she's not up to it. I tell her she's probably not used to the exercise or she's not eating well and she could probably be hurting herself (if she's not eating anything what good is doing all this exercise?) I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure you should be eating well if not having a balanced diet you won't have energy for workout. I don't know what to do and tried to help but failed after I put daughter to sleep I want some time together maybe watch a series but she's always too tired or has to wake up early for the gym and makes me feel like an asshole for asking for quality time, makes me feel selfish and honestly tears me up a little. I don't know what to do at this point I'm trying to be as supportive as I can but it's getting out of hand and I don't know what to do.", "Your guess is as good as mine, I've asked and she just responded with: \"Just drive me, I'm scared of driving\" when she's been driving alot farther for years.", "She used to eat alot and feel guilty about it l, doesn't help that her family has always given her a hard time for it, even if she wasn't even fat. About the affair I'm pretty sure she isn't, I mean I'm starting to wonder it now.", "You read my comment all wrong. Her needing to be driven only to the gym is what is strange not your refusal. You should NOT be driving her. If she is at a point of exhaustion she is overdoing it. And that is a concern. Her actions and reactions are off. There is some kind of problem here and you really don't want to see it.", "The cheating is probably out of the question but some of the comments have left me wondering, it wasn't in my mind to be honest. Yes if she feels that she needs to does this I understand but this is too much for me, it feels like she wants to spend more time at the gym than with us. My in law is kind of an ass telling her she's fat when she really isn't that makes me mad but that's a different story.", "Does she have other hobbies? I feel like in a relationship with kids 8 hours a week solo time is not too much? Do you get hobby time too?", "I'm a gym rat.  If she's not cheating on you there's very likely some mental health issues like orthorexia that have creeped in.  Or she might be competing in an aesthetics comp?  You would not be the asshole for sitting her down and asking her some things about why she needs to workout twice a day", "I feel like both things are happening", "Even exercise isn't healthy if is goes too far", "But doesn\u2019t answer the reasons why your wife is spending so much time at the gym.", "Um...she sounds extremely selfish and unreasonable.", "If she's such a fitness buff, why not bike to the gym? My son bikes to work 7 miles each way no matter what the weather. It's rather hard to believe she's been driving much farther for years and suddenly she's afraid. The whole thing smacks of something much deeper.", "So she can drive, but wants you to take her? It also sounds like she has exercise bulimia, where she feels like she has to burn every calorie she eats. NTA", "sounds to me like she could really benefit from some professional counseling, mental and nutritional. Also couples therapy for the both of you to work this out. If you just keep letting it happen, things could deteriorate to the point of no return.", "If she\u2019s asking you to drive, it\u2019s much less likely to be an affair.", "I just feel like I'm not supporting her enough and now feel like an ass. There's a bigger problem and I have asked but she just says she wants to feel good about herself and that's it but I don't know what other steps to take. I love my wife and I guess for now driving her is for the best.", "Sounds like a deeper issue she may have with herself. Definitely speak to her about how she truly feels about her body. What did she really see in the mirror.", "Oh good Lord, the cheating comments are ridiculous, don\u2019t give them another thought.  Her not preparing dinner prior to going at five when she\u2019s home at two thirty is equally ridiculous. I would throw out a compromise that you bring her as long as she has prepared dinner, you should not have to do both.", "We only have un kid and yeah I do support her and honestly didn't mind until my daughter told me if Mommy could miss this one day because she wanted to be with her and she refused that really pissed me off. She's usually on her phone looking at fitness videos. I don't really get hobby time but by my it's by my own decision because I want to spend time with my family at least watch a movie together or play some uno. If they're really tired and go to sleep early I treat myself with a little videogame night.", "I think she might have some problems and I have asked her but she keeps telling me she wants to feel good about herself and that's it. I have seen how intense her group is, they literally inject stuff of unknown variety and I do not approve and luckily my wife doesn't either. One time she told me they shamed her for eating a burger one time. It's really toxic and I don't understand why she wants to be shamed by random people who dope themselves.", "Non-zero possibility. Wife might not be doing anything sexual with another specific person, but an extreme emotional commitment to something/someone other than her family seems to be at play - without any additional insight other than what OP shared.\n\nTime to break out the gloves and shovels, as there's some digging needs to be done ASAP before someone makes a regrettable, life-altering decision.", "This is also what I don't understand, an hour a day for six days most of the time is enough imo", "There is this weird turn to get there maybe she just doesn't like the trip there.", "It is deeper but every time I try to approach her she says she feels bad about herself and fat and gets upset if she has a chocolate or ice cream and wants to work it off", "Honestly I don't know why she wants me to drive her she drives often but calls me an ass for not supporting her healthy habits. Yes she quite literally gets mad if she eats unhealthy foods and says she has to work twice as hard at the gym.", "I feel bad she's constantly asking if she's fat and honestly she isn't at all. She gets shamed at this place so I do not understand the need to go back there. She just won't listen to me and I've tried to tell her that if she wants to be healthy it's ok but do it for yourself not for the approval of some dumb people at the gym who make fun of her for eating a burger.", "One time I did consider saying \"if you want to go at least have dinner at the table before\" but its only a thought I've had because I would sound like an ass and she would hold it against me. I'm not that mad about not having dinner ready because I'm the better cook, I actually like cooking and dont mind at all, but at least have a sandwich for our kid.", "Yeah, you can overdo exercise. Plus, the timing right at dinner time for the family is weird. Unless she's looking for an excuse not to eat because she's being weird about food too.\n\nThere's something going on here with her health preoccupation she's not telling you about.", "Red flag for eating disorder/body dysmorphia. Having known some folks whose family members have suffered this, a trained professional is really just about the only chance she has to help her be OK with herself. My best friend's daughter nearly died from this. Being raped at college triggered it. Has your wife had any trauma  that may explain this sudden obsession?  It is so difficult to help them in any case but if she refuses to go to therapy, maybe a therapist could help you personally learn coping mechanisms. These things aren't easy and the answers aren't obvious without someone guiding you. I hope things work out.", "Yeahhhh, she sounds a little too obsessive about it. I completely understand why you\u2019re frustrated, but she had body image issues and you need to figure out a way to approach her about it so that she feels safe and not judged. I would probably compliment her on her effort and commitment, but also express concern for why she thinks she needs to go to the gym even more because she already looks great! Emphasize how good she looks too. Whatever her family is telling her, has really fucked her up. I\u2019ve been there, and it sucks. I hope you can figure it out together.", "Orthorexia is definitely a thing. \n\nTwo-a-day workouts are not necessary for anyone but professional athletes or training for a bodybuilding competition. \n\nFeeling like she has to exercise more because she at too much or ate junk food is an unhealthy mindset. \n\nNTA by any means. \n\nPlease encourage your wife to seek help.", "Oh no that is not okay. She is self sabotaging by going back n forth. She definitely needs to find a better more supportive gym.", "So, she\u2019s out working on herself and you get to work later and cook? You both need to come together on household duties that come before \u201cme\u201d time. Does she do the cleaning after dinner at least? Just doesn\u2019t seem equally distributed.", "Ever since the time she was laughed at for eating a burger one time she's stopped eating well, only having a salad or something light in her words.", "Yeah I do feel bad for her but when asked she just says she's fine just wants to feel good about herself, I'm trying to help but doesn't let me.", "Yes this is what I don't understand why she wants to go there, she says that they help her push herself but, shaming is not what I would call pushing her to be better, it's more like bullying. And don't get me started on pricing, a gym membership at PF is like $25 a month this place charges $175 a week! I would go one month to see their routines then leave and go to gym and do the routines myself and not get harassed by these assholes for eating one burger because I craved it one day.", "To be fair I cook Mondays and Tuesdays (the days she goes to the gym) also Saturdays. Wednesdays and Thursdays are her cooking days, Fridays we get take out and Sundays usually eat out. I wash the dishes because I can't stand leaving house with a mess, when we pick her up she doesn't have much to clean so I don't fault her. I'm not a clean freak but I can stand leaving house with dirty dishes or carpet with trash on floor so she doesn't have much to clean just disinfecting or mopping. If she sees I'm upset she takes out the trash out.", "That sucks your wife sounds stuck in limbo. It's hard but until she sees the problem it's gonna be talking to a break wall. However I would pay attention to her language about food around the child. Children listen to everything and can easily pick up on unhealthy habits. I was a product of a mom who made comments about food not what I was eating but it still made me switch things and go for days without eating. Not saying it would ever get to that point but definitely be mindful. Idk honestly what to suggest besides conversations and showing her examples of healthy gym environments but until she sees it and change unfortunately it's a losing battle. Wish you all the best in this man.", "Okay sounds like it\u2019s just the ride you\u2019re objecting to? If she wants to add evenings, she should drive seeing as you take her every morning so NTA", "Yes I just object to taking her, if she's so insistent in going she should go by herself then I can cook something better for us to eat and not be burdened by the fact I have to hurry up to pick her up. That the most bizarre thing, and I barely realized it, she drives herself in the morning to the same place every day (I don't drive her in the morning to be with my girl). I have no idea why she wants me to take her, she literally goes to the place every day on her own. Just realized the how weird that is lol.", "I was just enlightened by another comment, she's probably tired and it's the reason she asks me to drive her. Now I do feel like kind of an ass."]}
