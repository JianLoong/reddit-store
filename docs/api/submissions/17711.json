This visit the other day was the first in six weeks. Obviously I'm not going to sit down for coffee with my mother naked, so I threw on this robe/nightgown that still fit me, and left it at that. It's longsleeve and below my knees like a bathrobe, so I thought I was pretty covered.\n\nMy mom came over and we had a nice chat, but she seemed unsettled. I asked her what was up and she tried to brush it off, but eventually told me \"I'm just worried about you, you look like a wreck.\" now I admit I didn't look my best, I just threw my hair in a bun and I had a barely fitting nightgown on, but she my mom you know.\n\nI asked her how she expected me to look, and she said I could've at least put on some pants.

I tried to change the subject and she stayed a while longer, but it was awkward.\n\nWhen my husband found out he was pissed (And they ususally get along great) and called her to more or less tear her a new one about telling me what to wear.

You wear as much as I do lol", "NTA, pregnancy is already an uncomfortable time for most women, even if they don\u2019t voice it. Your body is under going major changes and stretching to accommodate your little one. You\u2019re in your own home trying to be comfortable and non-stressed, wear what you want to wear. If you\u2019re feeling a little down about your appearance or self care, maybe do a small at home \u201cspa day\u201d to freshen up and put yourself in a happy mindset.", "Without more information on how you presented yourself before pregnancy and the tone your mother used, I have to say NAH.\n\nI do not think there was anything wrong with what you described (pregnancy does so many unexpected and weird things to our bodies!) however if this is extremely unlike you, I can understand your mother's concern. If how she expressed this concern was done in a nasty way, that would make her an AH. For me, someone close to me saying \"wow you look like shit\" would not be abnormal and typically followed with a \"you doing okay?\"", "NTA no one has the right to tell you how to dress in your own home. Your mom is preoccupied with your appearance and needs to grow up", "NTA. You are taking care of yourself by making sure you and the baby are comfortable. \n\nIf your choice of clothing doesn't negatively impact your day to day life (which I gathered it doesn't) and even helps you to feel less uncomfortable, that is all that counts. Your mom needs to back off and stop overthinking when you simply wish to feel as good in your body as you can right now. And if not wearing pants helps with that, than all power to you.", "If you trust your husband's judgement, ask him if you are messing yourself up.  For me, I am not a uterus-enabled variety of human, so I will never know, but I imagine that wouldn't want to wear pants if I had a whole-ass other person in my abdomen.\n\nStill, it could be that you could be feeling better than you are.  But my instinct is that you should trust your husband's thoughts on that more than your mother's - he seems to have a good head on his shoulders.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m also 23ish weeks pregnant and I\u2019m lucky that I found some clothes that are comfortable. But unless I\u2019m expecting to go out or have work I\u2019ve mostly been spending my time in a nighty (sleep/night dress) as it is really comfortable and I don\u2019t need to worry about it fitting as I got a size up. \n\nWe\u2019re uncomfortable enough. Do what makes you comfortable.", "1. NTA: You're pregnant, in your own home, that your mother has come over to visit.  If you need to walk around nude to feel comfortable, that's your business... we're talking about your MOM here, not a bunch on strangers.\n2. While it was ok for your mom to show some concern if she thinks you might have a problem and wants to talk to you about it.  But I feel like she's crossed the line accusing your husband of ANYTHING unless you've been complaining to her about all your husband's short comings (she doesn't know what goes on in your house... not unless you tell her).", "NTA. you were at home, covered, and it\u2019s your mom. \n\nFWIW I had MAJOR perinatal depression and didn\u2019t like to be naked because I could see myself pregnant, and I\u2019m a pretty naked person normally. I also spent half my time crying while pregnant so as long as you feel happy I think you\u2019re probably in the clear on that. \n\nAdvice on maternity clothes I wish I had known: buy the stupid expensive lululemon align leggings online in the extra high waist in a size up, they feel like being naked and you can still wear them when you\u2019re not pregnant later on. Most maternity clothes suck, even the expensive ones, I found it best to just buy one size up in tops and dresses that had an empire waist. Check out little sleepies pajamas, the mom tops are so great for breastfeeding and pregnancy and they feel like being naked too. Use LSVIP for 15% off.", "Nta. It\u2019s your house. She\u2019s your mom. \nAlso I wasn\u2019t there so I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m thinking maybe your mom wasn\u2019t coming from a mean place and was just genuinely concerned about her daughters well being. Maybe she didn\u2019t communicate it well but that is how it sounds to me from what was included in this post. An over worrying mom. Her accusing your husband of not doing enough is a bit much but it does sound like it stems from a place of care and concern.", "NTA since it's your mom\n\nThat said I would recommend looking for comfy maternity clothes. I'm newly postpartum and the Kindred bravely maternity joggers were the best during 3rd trimester and still are postpartum. 110% recommend. So incredibly soft and comfortable. Their bras are great for nursing/pumping as well", "NTA You are in the comfort of your own home. Those last few months can be so uncomfortable and those pregnancy pants aren't the best they stretch but it just feels like a weird stocking stretched over your belly or the under belly band feels constricting. I wore giant men's cotton Tshirts around the house. Rest up and get as comfortable as you can! Congrats on the baby!", "NTA\n\nFrom what you've said, you were covered. It's not as if she saw anything so I don't get what the big deal is. She needs to get over herself.", "NTA", "NTA. A fellow mom more than anyone else should understand your situation.", "NTA.  Growing a human is fucking hard.  When I was pregnant, I went through a period of only wearing onesie long johns around the house.  I looked like The Penguin from Batman.  Your mom sounds judgey as hell.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be a better mother to your child than she\u2019s being to your right now.", "NTA. You can wear whatever you like in your own home, and your mother has seen you completely nude hundreds of times. She needs to get over herself. Wear a ball gown to her house next time you\u2019re over there.", "NAH.\n\nYour mother is worried, and I think for a valid-ish reason. I work from home, so I regularly go several days without getting dressed. However, WFH-dressing (or lack thereof) is a foreign concept to most people. In any normal situation, hearing that someone has not worn clothes for days on end would be a huge, instant sign that something is very wrong. \n\nCombined with the hair, especially if that's unusual for you, and presumably the basic signs of the toll of pregnancy and the fact that you were feeling gross, it's very probable that your mom showed up to see a radically different woman from the one she's used to. Six weeks is a long time when you're growing a human!\n\nI do encourage you to really think about how you're feeling, and how not dressing plays into it. Like I said, I do the same thing, but I *am* depressed. Annoyingly, I've found that forcing myself to get dressed when I've been like this for days inevitably makes me feel better.\n\nIf your changing body and lack of clothes you like prevents that from feeling good, and you're worried, maybe you should think about how to change that? Are there things you could do (yoga, stretching, body oils, baths, etc) that might help you feel like you fit better in your body? Could you get some new clothes that aren't weird-feeling maternity clothes, but rather things you can wear now and after (billowy dresses, kaftans, stretchy stuff, things that have lots of fabric but cinch at the waist)?", "As presented- NAH.\n\nYou get to do what it takes to be comfy. But 23 weeks is nothing compared to 39.\n\nBut your mom is not wrong to be concerned. Women work outside the home and have to wear clothes. Not seeming to care for one\u2019s self is a sign of depression.", "NAH.   \n\n\nShe was raising a reasonable concern for you\u2026 this is not normal behaviour, particularly at 24 weeks pregnant. Really not normal. Most people are only just moving out of \u2019normal\u2019 clothes at about 20 weeks and slowly into maternity clothes at this period. So the complete abandonment of clothing, hair, self care stuff\u2026 is very concerning. Very unusual. She cares about you.   \n\n\nYour husband probably shouldn\u2019t have torn your MIL a \u2019new one\u2019, but he\u2019s concerned too.   \n\n\nTalk to your GP. Seriously. This might be peri depression, it could be something more simple/specific like sciatica or hip issues forming up that early physio intervention might really help with going forward. And try to eat and sleep well. Take care of yourself. You deserve pants\u2026.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you're husband hasn't noticed any major changes in behavior or mood, you're probably ok.  If you or he are concerned, find yourself a perinatal mental health service, and talk to them. It will never hurt to check in with a provider and ask if something is within the range of normal.   \n\n\nSkin sensitivity and discomfort is a thing that can happen in pregnancy, even before you start showing- and nipple sensitivity is often a first clue that you're pregnant! So feeling gross and meh and not wanting clothes is \\*fine\\* (with my 3rd, I lived in a sarong for 4 months because clothes, bleh.)", "Nta \n\nIt\u2019s your house\u2026 if you want to walk around in a negligee who cares,  and you\u2019re pregnant it\u2019s not all gods after glow sometimes you\u2019ll look a mess as long as you feel comfortable that\u2019s the important part.", "NTA. It's been a dozen years since I was pregnant (with twins, no less), but maternity clothes were awful. At the time, I worked in an office with a dress code, which made it even worse. One trick I learned was to wear oversized men's tank top cotton undershirts underneath my clothes. That thin layer of breathable fabric made a huge difference, and it also gave my expando-pants some traction so they weren't always slipping down my belly. I remember getting some comfortable and affordable stuff at Old Navy, like yoga pants with a fold over waistband. I loved those things because they felt like normal pants. \n\nI'm not sure if your mom was genuinely concerned, or if she was picking at you (yes, I'm totally projecting here). But to jump from your appearance to peripartum depression to accusing your husband of neglect is just a lot. I'm glad your hubby has your back.", "NTA, during my pregnancy with my son I hated clothing.  They just made me feel so uncomfortable.  I pretty much lived in loose fitting dresses and nightgowns.  Sleeveless, because even short sleeves bothered me.  It's your home.  You're allowed to be comfortable.", "This is just not true. It\u2019s ABSOLUTELY normal to feel like shit at 24 weeks. You\u2019re tired, your stomach is expanding, you\u2019re growing an entire new human and that comes with new aches and pains and exhaustion. \n\nWhen a lot of people are home, they like to be comfy\u2014 no bra, unrestricting comfy pants, hair in a messy bun, etc. Doubly so for pregnant people, speaking as a recently pregnant person with several recently/now pregnant friends. \n\nAt 24 weeks my uterus was not only expanding, I was bloated. It felt very uncomfortable to wear anything with a waistband so I wore only a maternity nightgown all the time at home. \n\nSo all of this and you say she\u2019s depressed because she\u2019s uncomfortable wearing pants?? Because pants at home are the litmus test for depression. OP, you do not deserve to be restricted by pants! You deserve to wear whatever the hell you want in the comfort and privacy of your own home!", "At 24 weeks, for two pregnancies (and less so for several miscarriages) I\u2019d had 24 weeks of continuous vomiting, constant meds, weight loss, and permanent sea sickness.   \n\n\nPregnancy is not a pissing contest of who had it worse (shall I tell you how both bub and I wound up in ICU?) \u2026 but what is NORMAL is to get dressed and not spend only 6hrs a week in any form of clothing. It is ABSOLUTELY abnormal to refuse to wear more than a house coat when your mother comes to visit, or put on clothes for the rest of the week. This is an indication that the OP is well beyond the NORMS \u2026 and should probably talk to their GP.   \n\n\nYes, your uterus is expanding, but most people still fit into their comfortable clothes. Tracksuit pants, shorts, it\u2019s around 24 weeks people start to unbutton their jeans and consider maternity clothes. The bloating is horrid, but lots of people are bloated a lot of the time (hello PCOS and PMT!) \u2026.   \n\n\nIf her mum is concerned then thats a bigger sign of there being an issue than those of us on the internet, but I do feel like weeks of NO CLOTHES is unusual, and this is an opinion sub. I suspect a LOT of people will agree that weeks of being naked is not a normal part of being pregnant."]}
