He was an older guy about my dad's age. I knew he liked me but I wasn't into him for many reason. He had two kids(11m & 24f) who liked that I was living with him. I tried explaining to him many times that I was just his room mate to him because I was not ready for a relationship. He said he understood and enjoyed helping a friend out either way. I caught him calling me his girlfriend many times to people. I told him he needed to stop because we are not dating. He said he would stop but it just sounded right and normal so people don't ask what we are when we say we are going home. I said it doesn't matter what other people think. We are not dating. It got to the point to where I had to move because he wouldn't stop. \n\nOn to the story. I am now married with children. My family and I ran into him at the fair and he started talking with us. He mad a comment about how he hasn't seen me in shorts in a long time. My husband said that I wear them all the time when it's hot and asked when the last time he saw me in shorts. Terry looked at me and said \"the last time I saw you wearing shorts was when we were dating.\" My husband looked confused and asked me when that happened. I was irritated and told my husband it didn't but we lived together. Terry tried to say that we might as well have dated because we acted like it. Here's where I might be the AH. I started laughing and said he was delusional if he though I would have ever dated him. He said I was an AH and I didn't need to put it that way. I told him he wasn't getting hint that we never dated so maybe a more brutal approach would work. I don't think I said anything wrong but wanted to get more opinions on if IATA.

Dude's a massive creep!", "\" started laughing and said he was delusional if he though I would have ever dated him\"\n\nNTA - He was persistently misrepresenting your relationship to other people and then did it with your husband. Seems like a perfectly reasonable response and hopefully he stops referring to you like that in future", "NTA , you told him to stop many times and he didn\u2019t , being blunt seem to do the trick.", "NTA.  The guy sounded like a total delusional nut job.", " Nta\n\nYears ago, you told him to stop calling you his girlfriend. He wouldn't, and you had to move out. Years later, you bumped into him, he does the same thing and so you up the ante but he couldn't take it, and reacted by him'ing and hawing about how you shouldn't phrase it that way.\n\nSo how would he like it phrased? Would a frying pan across the forehead settle this once and for all?", "NTA. Calling him delusional was letting him off easy.", "NTA he was being a creep and was counting on you to care more about keeping calm than setting him straight. block him and be done", "NTA. You\u2019re right. A more aggressive response was needed to get the point across. Some people really are that delusional. Terry can suck it.", "NTA. Judging from your story, you\u2019ve told him many times to stop. He didn\u2019t respect your wishes at all and acted like an absolute creep that has no concept of consent.", "NTA, dude has been lying for YEARS about this.  I just pray he hasn't been lying further and going beyond just calling you \"dating\" to people.\n\nYou gotta stay far away from that man.  Maybe even consider a restraining order if he ever comes back again.  Dude is not right in the head.", "NTA. Terry made my skin crawl.", "NTA he crossed the line", "NTA. You asked him repeatedly to stop telling lies about being a couple or dating and he refused. He's suffering from a bruised ego brought about his lies.", "NTA this guy is a total creep. You did the right thing", "NTA. He wouldn't listen the nice way. And he sounds delusional if he convinced himself that all the times you said \"no\" were really \"yes\"", "NTA. The guy was delusional! You repeatedly made it clear that you weren't dating - just roommates. It's creepy that he insisted otherwise.", "NTA, you'd made it incredibly clear consistently that you were never interested in dating him at any point. This dude is delusional.", "NTA.\n\nhe sounds like an incel lol", "NTA he really is delusional and you handled well \nThat man sounds like a creep and why are most people like that when you talk to them nicely they just ignore and then they say you dont have to put it that way", "NTA. Terry sounds like a massive creep.", "NTA. I can not figure out why people who defend their own character and boundaries feel guilty about that. He lied, wanted too feel like a big man, could have caused an issue in your marriage, knew it when he said it, probably hoped for it when he said it. He\u2019s the AH.", "Terry sounds like a creep.  Yuck", "NTA. He is actually delusional.", "NTA. Your words were harsh for sure, but with some people you have to be to get through to them.", " NTA.

Good for you for shattering that crap into a million pieces.", "NTA he disrespected both you and your husband, you've been very clear.", "NTA. What an absolute creep. You were just right to put him in his place. Sadly there's probably people out there who believed him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHurrah to OP for not following the \"be nice\" dogma. The man was/is lying about you, right to your face.", "NTA, how is saying girlfriend any easier than saying roommate? Dude was trying hard and couldn't accept the rejection.", "NTA. What are the ages here? You say he\u2019s your dad\u2019s age, can I assume you were closer to the age of his daughter than to him?", "NTA - you made it clear to him while you were living with him that you were just roommates. \"Dating\" implies a degree of intimate gestures, at a minimum hand holding or hugging occasionally, sharing close moments that display affection, gift giving, sharing food (such as eating a meal together that you have also cooked together) etc. If none of those conditions were met and it was simply a case that you were living in the same house then there is logically no way a sensible person would consider it \"dating\" especially when you flat out tell them \"We are not dating\".\n\nSounds like the dude needed a damn good reality check", "NTA\n\n\nUsually I'd vote a different way, but as he was obviously trying to coerce you into a relationship, which is EWWWWWWWWW, he deserves everything he gets.", "NTA!!! You made this clear many times from what you say. This is both bizarre and infuriating. I just wonder how many stories he has embellished through the years? Just damn creepy", "NTA, what the actual fuck.", "NTA. Even if you slept together you made it clear that you weren't in a relationship. You told him you guys were room-mates.

Let\u2019s be honest\u2026\u2026 people that refuse to accept and respect boundaries repeatedly, never listen UNTIL the other person is fed up and has no other choice but to get \u201cmean\u201d. No one is ever the ahole in these situations, but the person who can\u2019t take a \u201cno\u201d for an answer always is. You set boundaries, you were nice/civil/polite about it, he refused.

Also, why didn\u2019t you tell him the truth up front? \u201cI\u2019m not ready for a relationship\u201d wasn\u2019t the truth. That implies that when you\u2019re ready for a relationship, he could be an option. You should have said \u201cI\u2019m not interested in you.\u201d Why didn\u2019t you say that?

There comes a time when it is fair to be brutally blunt when someone refuses to take the point any other way.\n\nOutright claiming or even simply implying a (former or current) romantic relationship where one has never existed is gross. \n\nHe could say that he wished you had been open to such a relationship, but saying that you were his former girlfriend or implying that you were when it wasn't true is creepy.\n\nRoommate/=girlfriend\n\nOne night stand/=girlfriend\n\nFWB/=girlfriend\n\nRoommate that had ONS or FWB/=girlfriend\n\nMuch like sex, informed consent feels like a necessary component before you can declare someone your gf/bf.

You're just spending time together.\n\n(I'm ignoring the tendancy of mostly older generation women to refer to their closest female friends as their \"girlfriends\" without any romantic relationship, since that has become less and less common. I'm now in my 50s. I have only heard it used in that sense by people a generation or two older and rarely in the past two decades, but maybe I'm simply not around younger people who use it in that sense.)", "NTA - *Necessarily* the AH.

As in: pay your rent and bills, do chores, have an agreement formally etc. Or, did you live with this guy and have him fund your life? You say you told him you weren\u2019t ready for a relationship. Interesting wording, could be implied \u201cnot ready for relationship right now, but interested.\u201d Kind of vibes.\n\nIf you did pay rent and have a roommate situation then you\u2019re NTA but if you did live on his \u00a3/$ then you imo kinda strung him along but still ESH.", "Did you live on his dime?", "Were you FWB with him?

The whole crack about wearing shorts was inappropriate, especially well, period. But I guess it goes double that it was made in front of his husband.

If someone decides to let someone else live in their place rent free or exchange rent for chores etc whatever the agreement was does NOT mean someone's entitled to a relationship. And does not mean they have the right to tell people they are dating when they aren't.\n\nSo gross to assume that if she lives rent free or at a discount or scratch that to assume because she lived their he was entitled to anything.\n\nShe made it abundantly clear she was not interested and he crossed so many lines.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, they didn\u2019t date.", "Sorry, english is my second language.

I just am curious about whether there is more to this that lead him to believe if they were involved in some way? It\u2019s an odd one. I\u2019ve seen others asking for info around how she got into living arrangement and whether she paid her way etc. hopefully OP updates.", "Unless you're being housed by a charity or shelter of some kind, there's no such thing as living rent free. \n\nWhen was the last time that a pair of platonic similarly aged friends decided to be flatmates but one of them only provided domestic labor? Effing never, because it isn't close to an even exchange.\n\nIt was a gross situation. A much older man offered to let a younger woman stay with him. **HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WAS INTERESTED** even if she didn't. Moving in with him was a poor decision on her part. He had ulterior motives.", "Still want info to make a ruling on it, we are getting a one sided view of what went on and why it ended.  I kinda want to know if there was more there.
