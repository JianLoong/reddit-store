But before you do this; I would partially clean up. Then set some new boundaries.  Try not be be accusatory.  \n\nThey messaged up and it's not fair, but mom is probably stressed out of her mind and doing 20 things and struggling with an adult moving home. I'm guessing she does a lot for you too!\n\nDoes she cook? Do laundry? Pay the bills? Assist with your activities? So you may be right. Evasion of privacy. Disrespect. But think about the family dynamic form her perspective. \n\nExample: Not the same, but I ask my kids to clean up toys all the time. I pick up after these kids all day long and so does mom. When they do pick up after repeated requests, they will then pick up only the toys they touched last, and leave the other half or 2/3rds for their siblings.  Then they fight over who touched what and then there is still a mess.  \n\nIt's crazy frustrating to be dealing with work, soccer, dance, lunch, dinner, laundry and then having a stupid fight over who should pick up a sock. \n\n\"Pick it up because I asked you to. Because you are walking past it, it will take an wind and and I need some F'ing help\" is my basic thought in that movement. \n\nAt a certain point your mom disrespected you and this was wrong, but if she had nicely asked you for a favor would you have said no?  I hope not. \n\nI would say if you want to learn how to sway your parents and learn how to make your life better (this will apply at work and in career as well), consider picking up this time, maybe move it to hall and then once this is de-escalated have a non-accusatory discussion with mom about why and how this shit happened and how to prevent it in the future. \n\nI'm guessing to her, this is \"I do so much for you all, please help!\" And to you it's \"this ain't fair\".

Throw it all away and when bro complains his stuff is gone - well you didn\u2019t claim it and remove it from my room so as I had to clean my messy room I got rid of the things I didn\u2019t want", "And make sure you block your door so she can't move it back, climb in and out the bedroom window if you have to get petty about it", "I was thinking it could just all be pushed out to the hallway", "being 15 doesn't make it parenting when they weren't the ones who bought the thing.", "This just made me laugh \ud83d\ude02", "Right? Like sorry, you dumped a bunch of shit in my room, both trash and not trash, how am I supposed to know what shouldn't be thrown away?", "I didn't disagree with that statement, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen.", "No I just know just what it feels like to wish everyday mama could tell me to clean up the bullshit mess she made one more time, you only get one mom bro", "No. Being born is compulsory. Fucking no one ever asked to be born, because if given the CHOICE we would have all said NO.\n\nYou may be morally obligated to feed and house who you give birth to but that doesn't mean a lousy parent/human being will do it! Hell, a baby can be legally abandoned within 2 weeks of birth at a hospital or fire station in America. \n\nBeing born, NO choice, no power.

OP has a good life, as a one time thing you can let it go.", "Jumping straight to yeeting yourself, how original. Comparing a singular instance of cleaning your room due to an unfortunate set of circumstances to continous abuse suffered due to bullying is uuhhm yeah as crazy as it sounds. This particular piece of advice applies to the former. OP can feel upset and justified, but you're still in a literal pile of filth.\n\nWow. \n\nI hope you got the help you need and will cease being triggered by reddit.", "Yet you let them!\n It's all your fault that you didn't speak up when you had the chance", "I am what I eat\nYour disgusting to look at", "Entitled as in he's never had to problem solve or think in common sense manner for himself because mommy and daddy always handled everything for him", "Kid might get grounded, but it'd be hilarious af. \ud83e\udd23", "That's a level of petty I aspire to!", "Or, maybe have the other child clean it because its a mess from HIS room not hers.

People are here because they have no life, are asking for advice, or because they need help.\n\nIf you're expecting original anything on reddit, or any kind of platform like this I suggest you figure your life out, because that's not gonna happen lol, no one who is mentally stable is posting their life story on a forum like this \ud83d\ude02.\n\nMy point stands.\n\nYou don't get to shit all over people for standing up to injustices committed by adults simply because \"life is unfair, suck it up, the sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be\".\n\nThat's garbage advice. \n\nJust because that's how it's \"always been\" doesn't mean it's how it SHOULD be. \n\nYou should be advocating for a better future for the future generation.

Obviously, you're unwell and extrapolate every piece of advice to some larger intense trauma event. Cleaning your room when living in a loving home is not the hill to die on.

I apologize for my slight over reaction, and my overblown response/rudeness.\n\nI do maintain, however, that it is important that children, especially teenagers who are approaching adulthood, learn that they ARE allowed to stand up for themselves;  although your idea of taking the chance to cool off and speak more level headedly is probably a good idea\n\nIn no way do i believe that op should be responsible for cleaning up the trash from her brothers room, that someone else dumped there\n\nThat is absurd", "Oh, you\u2019re 14, got it.", "https://media.tenor.com/q9crr\\_x6HLYAAAAM/princess-bride-you-keep-using-that-word.gif", "Forcing people to exist is pretty shitty.", "\n\n>expecting something undeserving without warrant or reason\n\nsomething like, Idk, your kid cleaning up a mess that you made? well, look at that. seems mom is the entitled one.", "Nice one dude.

I shouldn't speculate this much on your mental state. I'm sorry for that. \n\nWhen dealing with parents and people that have authority over you, combativeness doesn't make sense most of the time. You can voice disagreements without being disrespectful. You are in a loving home with a room to yourself, sucks that something unfair happened... but yelling at your parent to clean your room? You lost your chance at that moment to have your sibling help you or clean their trash. The mom didn't take the computer away, so she  has a healthy respect for the daughter's personal belongings. It feels overblown to me. Sticking up for yourself doesn't necessarily mean you get what you want. At a minimum, clean the room that you've been provided regardless of the circumstances.", "The parent jumped to stealing things of the kid as their first thought. I\u2019m solidly against this parenting style and your acceptance of it", "Staright up delusional lol. Big victim blaming mentality.", "I guess mom forgot that she didn't buy the kid her computer. Since she provides everything else for her, I wouldn't be so malicious about it. Like, is thought crime a thing?"]}
