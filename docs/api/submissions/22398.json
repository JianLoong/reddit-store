I'm guessing she does a lot for you too!\n\nDoes she cook? Do laundry? Pay the bills? Assist with your activities? So you may be right. Evasion of privacy. Disrespect. But think about the family dynamic form her perspective. \n\nExample: Not the same, but I ask my kids to clean up toys all the time. I pick up after these kids all day long and so does mom. When they do pick up after repeated requests, they will then pick up only the toys they touched last, and leave the other half or 2/3rds for their siblings.  Then they fight over who touched what and then there is still a mess.  \n\nIt's crazy frustrating to be dealing with work, soccer, dance, lunch, dinner, laundry and then having a stupid fight over who should pick up a sock. \n\n\"Pick it up because I asked you to. Because you are walking past it, it will take an wind and and I need some F'ing help\" is my basic thought in that movement. \n\nAt a certain point your mom disrespected you and this was wrong, but if she had nicely asked you for a favor would you have said no?  I hope not. \n\nI would say if you want to learn how to sway your parents and learn how to make your life better (this will apply at work and in career as well), consider picking up this time, maybe move it to hall and then once this is de-escalated have a non-accusatory discussion with mom about why and how this shit happened and how to prevent it in the future. \n\nI'm guessing to her, this is \"I do so much for you all, please help!\" And to you it's \"this ain't fair\".

There's plenty of things that weren't your parents fault,  but it was their job to get it taken care of.  \n\nFor example, let's assume there's a hypothetical situation where a room in the house suddenly loses power.   Your parents are going to do the right thing and pay for an electrician, pay for a generator to keep the room energized, and will more then likely move as many items out of the room as possible so the electrician can fix the issue.  Would the electrical short be their fault?  No,  but I guarantee you in that situation,  your parents would do everything they can to fix the house and keep it a safe place for you and your brother.   \n\nI'm sure they were mad because of having to fix the whole situation,  but I'm also sure they're expecting you to be a part of a family and help out in whatever way you can.

Told her that while you understood she and he  moved  it there as a temporary fix to clear the way for the electrician, they did it and they need to UNdo it. \n\n3.

Is it genuinely not within his means at this immediate time? \n\nI think you absolutely need to be compensated for what was broken. That said, having realistic expectations about how you are compensated is important as well. If he is able to pay, he absolutely should. Although the punishment of larger payment now is satisfying, I am not sure punishment is more effective than cooperation/rehabilitation if the goal is to continue to have a good bond with that person. \n\nAll said though, if guests mistreat you, you always have obligation to yourself to kick them out if needed. But I would lean towards ESH if you demand payment but don't want to do a payment plan (depending on whether or not it is a truly meaningful sum of money).\n\nApologies if the amount/time frame was already listed in the comments or in the post.

Getting angry back at people who are angry does not usually resolve things but turns it into an angry contest.

He was pissed until grandma said \"Well, you wanted starch.\" No one heard anything about starch again after that.", "Because it is a stupid idea in the first place? If you're already taking it out of your room, what is the point of moving it somewhere else, just to get moved again? Just throw it away and be done with it. \n\nEver hear the term \"pick your battles\"? This one isn't it. It's petty and stupid. \n\nFrom the op it's a few boxes and bags. Takes 5 minutes to clean up. Is it really worth the effort to cause even more drama over something that takes minutes to resolve? Dig your heels in on the big things, this isn't it. It took op longer to type this post up, than it would to clean the mess up.", "I mean, I'm on the same page with you in the sense that my parents were very abusive and at the time I thought it was normal, but when I became an adult and experienced things outside of that bubble, I very quickly realized the truth. But I guess some people aren't so quick to change their mind and instead just assume everyone else is the outlier. Very unfortunate.", "Can a grounded teenager call the police because their parent is unlawfully imprisoning them by instituting a grounding? \n\nParents have legal right to restrict a child's actions & access.", "That wasn't the point I was making (probably came down to poor wording on my part), the point was that he's gonna be in that house for a bare minimum of 2 more years. The legal emancipation would be him leaving AT 17 (the bare minimum). Realistically he's there for 3 more years.\n\nWasn't saying emancipation was the option to gtfo, was just stating if everything somehow went COMPLETELY wrong, that's the fastest window (short of them kicking him out which is an entirely different ball game) he had to get out of there.", "Don\u2019t tell him to do this. He\u2019s a kid. This could backfire on him.

I just don't agree that she has to take it to the dump per your original comment. That's cleaning up just like her mom and brother want her too.

OP was in the right, but handled the situation in the most immature and passive aggressive way possible.\n\nI was with them until they said they just passive aggressively decided to ignore the trash.", "I am.

I\u2019ve also taken items I knew he used regularly and hid them where he\u2019d never look. I also used his clothes to clean up dog piss off the ground lol. I don\u2019t even remember why. I just remember doing these things when my brother pissed me off real bad. And we pissed each other off every day. Our parents couldn\u2019t punish the other in any meaningful way so we just served justice ourselves.\n\nIf I was born a boy, we probably would\u2019ve beaten each other.

If OP was 18, I'd say dump it on the kitchen floor. But at 15, just getting it out of their room and then getting a door lock would be the way to go.

One of those ingrained sexist expectations about whose responsibility it is to clean up.", "Not fish. SHRIMP. WAY nastier smelling when it goes off.", "Unfortunately for the folks who are disagreeing, your point DOES still stand.\n\nI was in a family dynamic similar to this for 23 years and only got out a bit under a year ago. The family dynamic is clearly not good JUST from the comments she made towards her 15 year old child about taking the shit they paid for and own (thats theft, for the folks disagreeing), guilting them for giving birth to them and needing to do the BARE MINIMUM to take care of them, and dumping their golden childs trash in their room so they can jump on this kids ass about cleaning up the mess THEY LEFT in this poor kids room\n\nThis is a horrible family dynamic! and the amount of people saying \"your point doesn't stand\" and \"from just this story this tells us nothing about the family dynamic\" have either never experienced this kind of treatment or might have been the golden child. A good parent wouldn't threaten to steal your property that you own, wouldn't dump the trash of another kid in your room then expect you to deal with it and not deal with it when they did it, and guilt a child for even being born.\n\nIt's not our fault we were born. Our parents wanted us, and that doesn't give them the right to guilt us over their choice to have a baby. Making a mess in our room and making us fix it isn't being responsible for what you've done. Stealing property that someone paid for by themselves is not reasonable or right in the least, and I would encourage this kid to call the cops over it if it happened because THEFT IS THEFT.\n\nI hope this kid can save up and get the hell out. If I can see this is fucking terrible from one post, who knows just how much worse it actually is. This is an iceberg we've only seen the tip of."]}
