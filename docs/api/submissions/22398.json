I'm guessing she does a lot for you too!\n\nDoes she cook? Do laundry? Pay the bills? Assist with your activities? So you may be right. Evasion of privacy. Disrespect. But think about the family dynamic form her perspective. \n\nExample: Not the same, but I ask my kids to clean up toys all the time. I pick up after these kids all day long and so does mom. When they do pick up after repeated requests, they will then pick up only the toys they touched last, and leave the other half or 2/3rds for their siblings.  Then they fight over who touched what and then there is still a mess.  \n\nIt's crazy frustrating to be dealing with work, soccer, dance, lunch, dinner, laundry and then having a stupid fight over who should pick up a sock. \n\n\"Pick it up because I asked you to. Because you are walking past it, it will take an wind and and I need some F'ing help\" is my basic thought in that movement. \n\nAt a certain point your mom disrespected you and this was wrong, but if she had nicely asked you for a favor would you have said no?  I hope not. \n\nI would say if you want to learn how to sway your parents and learn how to make your life better (this will apply at work and in career as well), consider picking up this time, maybe move it to hall and then once this is de-escalated have a non-accusatory discussion with mom about why and how this shit happened and how to prevent it in the future. \n\nI'm guessing to her, this is \"I do so much for you all, please help!\" And to you it's \"this ain't fair\".

What did you want OP to say \"Oh I'm sorry for the fact that I was born, of course I must be wrong since you fed and housed me for the last 15 years...\" or what? OP's response was something that their mother needed to hear with what she said, threatened to literally steal OP's computer as a punishment aswell as guilted her for being born", "Ok Boomer", "Repeat yourself a bit more, my point still stands. If you believe you can take away someone's belongings that they paid for as a punishment or believe that you can use their birth as a way to guilt them then your dynamic with said person isn't going to be a good one", ">my point still stands\n\nNo it doesnt"]}
