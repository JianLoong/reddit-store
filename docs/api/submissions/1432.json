I have passed state troopers on the interstate going 50 over the speed limit and they just waved. I was in the right lane.", "YTA - Learn the rules of the road if you're going to drive. Also don't get aggressive or react to aggression if you can't back yourself and will just get upset and complain about it online. You never know who's in the other car.", "Left lane is for passing.

Move on \u263a\ufe0f", "ESH. If you\u2019re driving the speed limit, then just move to your right. You know the left lane is the passing lane. \n\nThat being said, the lady should not have flipped you off. Given that she did, maybe you should have tried waving goodbye to her.

Also its not a question of right or wrong, it's more a question of whether you think you could back yourself in a roadrage situation. \n\nDon't come looking for sympathy online when you've driven badly and then further aggravated a rightly annoyed driver.

You can \"think\" you're not being a certain way all you want. That doesn't mean you aren't being a certain way. \nImo, when you fail to understand the rules of the road while driving, you're inherently rude. Plain and simple. Again, why I said soft YTA, because it seems like you just didn't know.

Such a sensitive soul, I bet you'd get it absolutely handed to you in a fight.", "No, I'm saying morality doesn't really play much of a part in roadrage and you're incredibly naive if you think what's right or wrong makes a difference to everyone.", "You seem pretty dense tbh, glad you've finally worked out you're a shit driver though. Maybe you'll learn some more lessons in life, who knows.
