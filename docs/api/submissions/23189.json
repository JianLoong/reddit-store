Because you eliminated your niece without bothering to check with her parents to see if there might be something that she could do. \n\nThere could have been a discussion about what she could wear that would not cause tripping. There could have been a discussion about what types of things Lily could do easily, without stumbling or falling, or ways to help her accomplish her task with an adult to help. \n\nLily could have been given an assignment that did not require her to stand still. She could have done her part and then gone to sit with her parents. Perhaps she could do something at the reception and not during the wedding ceremony itself? \n\nIf Lily is receiving therapies of any kind, her wedding task could become the goal for some of her therapy--she would have a goal to work toward that she really wants and that would motivate her. \n\nA little outside the box thinking could have come up with a plan that would work for both OP and Lily. \n\nThe reason I feel so strongly about this is that it sounds like Lily has a disability. Kids with disabilities are sidelined and excluded all the time. There are so many thing that they simply cannot do. It is a kindness to include them when possible. \n\nOne of my nephews has used a power chair since he was old enough to use a joystick. He has been a ring bearer at a wedding. At another wedding, the groom was in the military, and Nephew was entrusted with bringing a sword to the Happy Couple for the cake cutting at the reception (and Nephew was the envy of all the little boys there). \n\nI'm not saying the OP has to include Lily, as not all her nieces are included.

Ideas: handing out programs (if she leaves her spot, I'm sure people will just take one on their own). Handing out bubbles or something for when you're walking out (same reason as before).

Reading this is like reading an aita where you tell a dyslexic to not go to a funeral because you can\u2019t stand that they read the funeral order of service well  being a distracting colour but it helps them read compared to white. (bit extreme but you see the way logic and biases agains certain disability you don\u2019t fully understand have effected an decision in a harsh way.)Your niece will have complete cognitive function to know why you kept her out and it will just be another reason to be made to feel bad about themselve. Which is why she will have been crying, it\u2019s not to do with what you said it\u2019s the reasons and (unfortunate) shittyness that comes from people that don\u2019t have the disability. Hearing but you can dance with me with the knowledge you have asked other family members who you see as easier will hurt. Especially at that age. For kids with learning disabilities a lot of things others take for granted come a lot harder and it does lead to exclusion and others showing them they are less of because of their disabilities even if they don\u2019t realise it. School for someone with a learning disability is really hard even with schools claiming it\u2019s gotten better it\u2019s not, it usually just leads to students being treated differently. It is already a really isolating time. To then be the person not asked and left out compared to the rest of your family due to a disability you already feel bad about. I really feel for your niece. It\u2019s your wedding and do what you want but this post personally comes off like you are scared she will wreck your big day rather than for her health and because you where self focused (which is fine selfishness can be good) it will have created more reasons for your neice to feel inadequate due to something out of her control. And when you read what you actually say about your niece, she falls over which brings attention to herself, she can\u2019t stay still, it\u2019s not actually that big a thing or distracting. Yes on your big day is okay to be selfish and not want to have your niece but it will probably come with building on the  trauma students with  learning difficulties deal with. Which (although very very wrong and assholish on her part)  makes your sisters outbursts more understanable. It can be really hard to watch your kid struggle in the education system, with exclusion and to be made to feel bad about themselves and then having it be a reason your family treat your child differently must be hard. I know it sounds nuts but I did witness a lot of bright, intelligent students beaten down into feeling inadequate and stupid due to these disabilities. Incidents like these can be really quite a big deal when you can\u2019t  change like others want you too.\n\n (Also side note that just was personal, if the condition is dyspraxia personally calling it a behavioural disability as you did in the comments rather than a learning disability is kinda shitty, basic research shows it\u2019s a cognitive problem which personally I see it as falling under learning disability. It also might explain how you can be a little insensitive to your niece)\n\nAlthough you are not in the wrong your sister might appreciate a bit more understanding from you and a bit more time looking into how your niece is effected, the type of disorder it is and activities you guys can do when it\u2019s not your wedding that\u2019s a bit more your niece friendly. Also you may not think you where harsh but if the kid cried they knew you thought they where odd. \n\nTheres no easy answer to this question I think what you need to do is research and show a bit more empathy to your sister, after that have a sit down talk with your niece and see if there\u2019s something more her appropriate you guys could do, idk a nail salon a week or two before the wedding or something to show you don\u2019t see her as lesser or a problem for your big day (which is how your post came across and you may have come across to your niece) and to display you are genuinely concerned for her issues.", "You ARE being a jerk.

An \u201ceducational disability\u201d as defined by IDEA is the *minimum* legal standard in educational settings. It is not the maximum possible support a student can receive, though all too often school systems treat it that way. \n\nAdditionally, the lack of SpEd support for ODD hinges on the ideology that children with the disorder are just being brats, leading to a consistent problem of insufficient support, thus the routine approaches for working around the limitations of IDEA. \n\nAnd to return to the core point, none of this makes it ODD not a disability. \n\nhttps://www.naset.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Handouts/What_Parents_Need_Know_504_Accomodations_Plans.doc\nhttp://www.conncase.org/Customer-Content/WWW/News/PDFs/March_2018_Conference/ED_EBD_ODD_Jacobs_Handouts_for_Keynote.pdf\nhttps://cannondisability.com/blog/oppositional-defiant-disorder-odd-ssi/#:~:text=CAN%20A%20CHILD%20GET%20SSI,Security%20Income%20(SSI)%20program.", "Or give her a job to do at the reception.  When I was little, I was all butthurt about not getting to be the flower girl at my cousin\u2019s wedding.  My cousin asked me to be \u201cin charge\u201d of passing out little tulle bags of rice at the reception (back when throwing rice was a thing).  I felt very important circulating among the guests with my special basket, but if I\u2019d flaked out, they could have just set the basket on a table and let people get their own rice.", "That was pm my bridesmaid job. Last year, when I was 24. My cousin had a pretty small wedding, but wanted all of us girl cousins and her sisters to be her maids, plus her bestie.

Her job is to have fun and eat cake. That she still gets to wear something pretty and enjoy the party, even be in photos if you plan to have her in any, she just doesn't have to spend the whole ceremony standing in uncomfortable shoes.", "A lot of eleven year olds would not really be considered for a wedding role. Max age of a flower girl, is probably about eight and the age for a junior bridesmaid is about sixteen. Of course there is a vast difference depending on where you live.
