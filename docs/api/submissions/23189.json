If/when she runs off, you can either have a table where people can pick up their own program/fan/etc or you can have a second person helping her as back-up. \n\nIf she wants to help with a pre-wedding task, find a simple craft appropriate to her skill level, like coloring some paper decorations, making a paper garland, sand art, whatever. Use it to \"decorate\" the room where you're getting ready, or some other out of the way space at the venue. \n\nIf she needs something to do during the ceremony, have her write/color thank you notes for you.

Are you aware that any child has the possibility of being disabled? \n\nI think you specifically left out her diagnosis because you know it will change the responses. \n\nFigure something out.

Couldn't you have just had Lily's Mom as a Flower Girl's \"assistant\" just to be in the Wedding with her and help distract Lily as and when its needed ?", "This was a tough one, but I came down on YTA.\n\nWhy? Because you eliminated your niece without bothering to check with her parents to see if there might be something that she could do. \n\nThere could have been a discussion about what she could wear that would not cause tripping. There could have been a discussion about what types of things Lily could do easily, without stumbling or falling, or ways to help her accomplish her task with an adult to help. \n\nLily could have been given an assignment that did not require her to stand still. She could have done her part and then gone to sit with her parents. Perhaps she could do something at the reception and not during the wedding ceremony itself? \n\nIf Lily is receiving therapies of any kind, her wedding task could become the goal for some of her therapy--she would have a goal to work toward that she really wants and that would motivate her. \n\nA little outside the box thinking could have come up with a plan that would work for both OP and Lily. \n\nThe reason I feel so strongly about this is that it sounds like Lily has a disability. Kids with disabilities are sidelined and excluded all the time. There are so many thing that they simply cannot do. It is a kindness to include them when possible. \n\nOne of my nephews has used a power chair since he was old enough to use a joystick. He has been a ring bearer at a wedding. At another wedding, the groom was in the military, and Nephew was entrusted with bringing a sword to the Happy Couple for the cake cutting at the reception (and Nephew was the envy of all the little boys there). \n\nI'm not saying the OP has to include Lily, as not all her nieces are included. But damn, it would make Lily's day if she was.", "So seat her a a table with the guest book in a pretty dress and a flower. Surely there is some small role she could fill.", "While I wouldn't say YTA I would say you could put some thought into it and \"make up\" a role for her, especially if all the other nieces and nephews are included . If you're worried that she will be a distraction during the ceremony, think of one that doesn't put her in it. Ideas: handing out programs (if she leaves her spot, I'm sure people will just take one on their own). Handing out bubbles or something for when you're walking out (same reason as before). You could even see if her mom would help her with it, so that she is supervised.", "YTA\n\nA wedding is a family event. While of course you and your soon-to-be spouse are the focus, you should lighten up a little. If your niece causes a little disturbance or falls over or something, you all know who she is and why it happened. You aren't Princess Kate and he isn't Prince William, this isn't going on national television, and ultimately nobody gives a fuck except your friends and family.

Nobody is entitled to be a bridesmaid, flower girl, etc. Weddings for me are not just joyful occasions but are serious ones as well, as the couple are making a promise to commit to each other, it is the first day of their marriage, and organising them are stressful enough as it is. People are invited to share their day and support them, and it is a privilege to be asked to be a part of that.  Therefore, the bride and groom are within their rights to reduce any stress leading up to and on that day. Sadly, there is a risk Lily will create that stress\n\nI thought OP was being fair and diplomatic when she said to her that her role was to party.
