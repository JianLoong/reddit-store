Because you eliminated your niece without bothering to check with her parents to see if there might be something that she could do. \n\nThere could have been a discussion about what she could wear that would not cause tripping. There could have been a discussion about what types of things Lily could do easily, without stumbling or falling, or ways to help her accomplish her task with an adult to help. \n\nLily could have been given an assignment that did not require her to stand still. She could have done her part and then gone to sit with her parents.

Kids with disabilities are sidelined and excluded all the time. There are so many thing that they simply cannot do. It is a kindness to include them when possible. \n\nOne of my nephews has used a power chair since he was old enough to use a joystick. He has been a ring bearer at a wedding. At another wedding, the groom was in the military, and Nephew was entrusted with bringing a sword to the Happy Couple for the cake cutting at the reception (and Nephew was the envy of all the little boys there). \n\nI'm not saying the OP has to include Lily, as not all her nieces are included.

Ideas: handing out programs (if she leaves her spot, I'm sure people will just take one on their own). Handing out bubbles or something for when you're walking out (same reason as before).

I swear it was not worth the drama! \n\nIf I had know then what I know now I would have take my dress and eloped on the beach! It been so much petter. \n\nBut I will leave you with this also. I let others bully me and put people in my wedding to make family happy! To \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. It became more about what they wanted and less about me. That is my greatest regret. Don\u2019t let them bully you till it no longer feels like your wedding.", "Dear OP, It is your day and you should not have to walk a diplomatic tightrope - it is unfair, especially if you and your fianc\u00e9 are paying. Weddings are stressful enough as it is. Personally, I don't think Lily's mother has thought this through, as she's hellbent on having you be inclusive at the cost of not just yours but her daughter's comfort and wellbeing. \n\nIf you did capitulate and made Lily a flower girl:\n1) How would she cope with having to be measured for her dress?\n2) Would she be able to handle having to be part of group photos\n3) would she be able to cope with having to get up by a certain time? Are her eating times, time critical?\n4) Would she be able to be in official photos without issue?\n5) Would she be able to travel to the ceremony without her parents.\n\nIf most of the question are 'no' / 'she can't', it will be cruel to force her out of her comfort zone", "This is a great idea for all the kids", "There\u2019s other nephews and niece not included.

A wedding isn\u2019t the best place for a learning moment, and a public embarrassment might make her reluctant to trying again when she\u2019s older and more mature. Also, your wedding is your wedding, you have no responsibility to make it a learning experience and potentially ruin it.", "Why does she have to be included?

However, the way you talk about her kinda gives away the fact you don't like her bc of her condition. In my opinion, that's your right bc we choose who we like, but anyone who likes that kid will remember this about you. It seems cruel, and families get VERY attached to ill children so they'll resent you. If you want to save face, just say you really only need 1 flower girl and that's it. The rest of the wedding party is adults. That makes more sense.", "You know you could just have all the kids hand out bubbles or bird seed or whatever. Or even bulletins. It is not vital, can't be broken, and if they leave, it is not a big deal. \n\nNot enough details.", "NTA. Likely niece is at that age where she doesn't quite feel like a kid, or a teenager so she just defaults to feeling left out. Regardless of disorder it would be kind hearted to give her some sort of busy work, just so she feels included. The mom can go kick rocks for starting needless drama.", "NTA. If Lily can't handle the responsibilities of being in a wedding party then it's for the best that she isn't.

(bit extreme but you see the way logic and biases agains certain dysabililities you don\u2019t fully understand have effected an decision in a cruel way.)Your niece will have complete cognitive function to know why you kept her out and it will just be another reason to be made to feel bad about themselve. Especially at that age. School for someone with a learning disability is really hard Even with schools claiming it\u2019s gotten better it\u2019s not, it usually just leads to students being treated differently. It is already a really isolating time. To then be the person not asked and left out compared to the rest of your family due to a disability you already feel bad about. I really feel for your niece. It\u2019s your wedding and do what you want but this post personally comes off like you have a bias against learning disability\u2019s like dyspraxia, which is a real shame.", "You ARE being a jerk.

And please ignore all the people who are trying to get you to name Lily's specific disorder, because it's not relevant. I guarantee that if you DID specify, you'd have a ton of people saying \"that shouldn't make her incapable of being involved in the wedding\" and/or \"I know someone with that disorder and they're just fine\". I worked for several years for a non-profit that assisted people with a particular disorder and our clients ranged from people you would barely know had a disorder to severely affected people. The bottom line is, YOU know YOUR niece and what she's capable of.

It\u2019s hurtful and leaves you feeling subtly dehumanised. She\u2019s gotta learn to live with pride even tho she\u2019s visibly clumsy etc. Part of that involves taking risks. Your wedding may not be the place for that, but also imagine how she feels to feel she\u2019s being left out because she might ruin the picture perfect wedding - her mom is perpetuating that by insisting that you give her something to do. \n\nDespite this though, you\u2019re not obligated to give here a job at the wedding, especially as she\u2019s not the only one not included. But you say you did make a call partially on the basis of her disability, when you could have worked with her mom to find something she could do, if you had been inclined.

Disabled people often get excluded from things and places simply because people are unwilling to put in even an iota of time or energy into making things accessible.", "I mean OP is obviously leaving out relevant details on purpose. The purpose is probably either that the disorder is a hot button topic and they don't want to distract from the issue at hand, or it's a very uncommon disorder and they want to protect anonymity.

She's gotten treatments and therapies that have helped her learn how to do it semi-consciously - if someone had made a post about that disorder with a kid the same age as her, I would immediately look to see if it was actually about her.", "Well she is also excluding others, so why?", "Exactly, the details OP leaves out seem irrelevant to whether OP is TA or not.\n\nIf OP wants to be inclusive, maybe they can look into inventing a role that the niece CAN do, but there shouldn't be any obligation at all.
