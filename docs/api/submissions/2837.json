Except, things are going south. \n\nI actually made a post yesterday asking AITA for going to a thanksgiving dinner with my family while she\u2019s on her girls trip (because my family is leaving out of town prior to thanksgiving), which she called me about being half drunk saying my family loves planning things while she\u2019s not there (I\u2019d argue is not true\u2014she goes to her hometown about once every two months for a half week and sometimes has not been here for family occasions). My family loves her being around. \n\nAnyways, today she texted me drunk saying that they wanted to kick her out of her hotel because she told the waiter something along the lines of \u201cyou guys are shit\u201d (translated from her native language) for \u201cnot having brought her a shot she had ordered\u201d and that the staff are pissed off at the bachelorette group. Literal words she texted me. She asked if I could help talk to the staff about this and I told her \u201cno, you need to fix this and go apologize to the waiter.\u201d I\u2019m pretty pissed off, I know they\u2019re all drunk having fun but this is unacceptable behavior IMO. She called me and I\u2019m not answering because yesterday when she called we got into that argument I don\u2019t want to get into. I have a feeling this will result in her thinking I don\u2019t have her back later down the road (for not having chosen her side).\n\nNot sure what to think right now.

Good luck with that one.", "NTA. Your SO is wrong and can\u2019t handle being told she\u2019s wrong. Not a great sign. Everything is everyone else\u2019s fault but hers. the drinking thing would make me go \ud83d\ude2c, does she often drink to excess wherein she loses her ability to be a civil adult?", "NTA you might want to give it some more time before you get married", "NTA. First of all, I don't understand why she would be upset about you attending Thanksgiving plans with your family, which is a very reasonable thing to expect during this holiday. I assume she would have been invited to this Thanksgiving celebration had she not had other plans already made. Second of all yeah it's entirely on her if she's going to treat hotel workers like shit while being drunk. Of course you're not the asshole. She's more than welcome to indulge and have a good time but she still needs to be an adult and i have a hard time having compassion for somebody who's going to treat hard working hotel staff like shit. They have every right to be upset with the Bachelorette group over her behavior.", "Honestly, the way that people treat hospitality workers speaks volumes IMO. I get she was drunk but I would definitely think about pushing back the wedding if possible. Sounds like there are some things to consider before taking that step. You are NTA.", "Being disrespectful to staff is ALWAYS a red flag. If she can\u00b4t tell when to stop drinking it\u00b4s a red flag too. It was right of you not to bail her out, she is a grown woman, let her deal with the  actions of her consequences herself. NTA", "NTA but i have to wonder is she normally like this when she drinks or gets with her friends, how often does she drink?", "NTA\n\nTell her to grow up. Sober up and be an adult. How old is she? 18?\nHas she always binge drank like this? Gotten obnoxious when drunk?\n\nShe sounds like a very immature twaat.\n\nBest thing the hotel could do is kick her out. \n\nI'd review marrying her. She sounds like a childish fool.", "NTA. \n\nIf she's old enough to drink, she's old enough to clean up her drunken messes.", "NTA. Drunk disrespectful GF expecting you to clean up her messes is not a good look. Let her deal with all of that. She probably did way worse to be threatened to be kicked out. And calling you to vent about your family while drunk is also a no-no. I\u2019d also be weary of this messy side of her.", "NTA. She seems really insecure especially in regards to your family. That being said, whatever shenanigans that happen in a bachelorette party/trip shouldn\u2019t bleed over into your relationship especially if she\u2019s being unruly. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider these to be red flags especially given the fact that you said she\u2019s normally respectful. Once she\u2019s home I\u2019d have a serious discussion about how she acts when she\u2019s drinking and surrounded with friends.\n\nRelationships require work, it\u2019s a two way street. Communicate and set boundaries. She needs reassurance about your family (which is a little ridiculous, but not a deal breaker). Sounds like she\u2019s a little selfish and she\u2019s afraid of that selfishness reflecting in you. It\u2019s like a cheater worrying their partner is cheating because they are (I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s cheating lol).\n\nAll in all. NTA.", "Brother you need to seriously consider marrying her because you see I always believe sometimes people see warning signs before they get married but of course love makes us ignore them. Sometimes people change but in most cases they don't and if they don't things tend to go south a lot. I bet if you get married to her you will be posting again a couple months about almost similar issues.\n\nI mean you already posted twice in two days", "YWBTA if you actually marry this hot mess.\n\"When people show you who they are, believe them\"\n\n15 year olds learn dating #1 \ud83d\udea9:\nSteer clear of anyone rude to waitstaff.", "NTA. Cleaning up your own messes is the best way to learn not to make them. Also, her expectation that it\u2019s your \u201cjob\u201d to swoop in and fix her (self made) problems is a really bad foot to get off on in a marriage. You\u2019re also not the ah for going to your family\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner while she\u2019s not available. This actually raises more red flags to me than her wanting you to fix the hotel mess. Your life should still be expected to go on, even if she isn\u2019t there to participate with you. That \u201cit\u2019s all about me\u201d attitude is worrisome.", "I remember your post.  Yeah, I understand you having trouble processing this.  She's nice when she's sober, but not when she's drunk, we're seeing.  Is she drunk often?  Is this an unaccustomed amount of alcohol for her, and she's really not \"herself\"?  It's said that alcohol brings out a person's true nature--whether they get maudlin, or argumentative, or violent, or just fall asleep in a corner.  \n\nTo answer your question: NTA.  She insulted someone.  It's on her to apologize.  I don't know how you would \"help\" apologize, other than suggesting appropriate wording.  This is not about having her back.  That's for when someone is insulting her, you stick up for her.  This is the reverse, and it's on her.  My opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
