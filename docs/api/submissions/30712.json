My motto in these situations are to say what\u2019s on your mind, say it like it is, but say it without being disrespectful. I think it\u2019s important for her to know that her actions, (aside from being childish, petty, and manipulative), make you feel like she isn\u2019t valuing you as a person, and is disrespecting your friends trust in you. But also that you understand why she might have some trust issues, and that it\u2019s okay to have areas that needs improvement, as long as she understands that it is HER issues, and that she is projecting it onto you.  Of course you can be there to help her improve, but ultimately it is her responsibility to not hurt others.\n\nIt kinda reminds me of a quote I read a long time age.

When my ex was constantly insecure and worried about me cheating, I didn\u2019t think about it, because I thought it was just insecurities. It wasn\u2019t until after years, I learnt that it was because she was doing it, and tried to normalise it, in an attempted to excuse her own behaviour, and feel less guilty. But even then, I would never require a partner to give up their privacy, and their social media accounts just to cater to my issues.\n\nI want to underline, I\u2019m not saying that I think your SO is cheating, just that even though her suspensions may be explained by previous relationships, it is neither excusable, nor does it prove she isn\u2019t. I just want you to be careful, and not get hurt.", "she needs to know that it's not fair to treat new people in her life like shit because of the things others have done to her. acting like you're cheating because her exes did it is not the move", "Psycho chick shut like this is gonna ruin her third relationship.\n\nAnd when you inevitably break up,  bet you good money she's gonna assume you were cheating and will be even worse with her next", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffbThis is what an adult relationship looks like!! \nNot to mention you are entitled to have things that are just yours and your privacy!! Being in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you become one person and you\u2019ve only been dating for 5 months! This relationship is too new for her to be acting this way!! \nI\u2019d take a step back and have a hard look at what you want from this relationship!! In the meantime YNTA", "I lived with someone for 7 years and the only password I had was to his computer. Why would I ask for passwords anyways? We shared use of the computer. \n\nNta, but this relationship is headed toward disaster.", "I see that you have been a guest on this show as well!", "Yeah that too. But ill take that over the endless arguments that never stop. I got ptsd from her, anywhere we went she always had a problem with anything i did, it was so bad, the minute i identify that behavior i run!", "Its a tactic that a quirky person would come up with because they are to coward to say what they really want and its cute to manipulate. Humans can be crap people sometimes..", "I think they meant in casual conversation.\n\nThink \"Jack got engaged to Jane\" sort of stuff, not private secrets.", "Is that actually my only viable option? She's a really sweet and fun person honestly and I want to know if trust issues this deep can be sorted out or should I just bail?", "My husband and I do not have each other\u2019s PINs because we understand security. We use password managers, and in the case of emergency or death, we are set up as each other\u2019s next of kin to take over all accounts.\n\nHe also turns on his location when he goes off-roading for photography shoots. But only then. Likewise I turn mine on if I deviate from my routine. Otherwise we share calendar appointments for our activities. I don\u2019t need to know where he is every second of the day. How tedious, cloying and exhausting.", "This is fine but the point that needs to be brought home in these types of situations is that every human should be entitled to the level of privacy they CHOOSE to have. You chose to share your PIN that\u2019s great that it works for you guys but in this case OP needs to rethink the PIN bc clearly his SO does not trust him and made it clear she has zero intentions on respecting his boundaries.", "That name is telling. \n\nI agree with you. Bad friend. I\u2019m not telling my friends\u2019 secrets to my husband!", "How about after you finally break up she calls the police and says you threatened to stab her?", "unless she is willing to go to therapy to work on WHY she has the need to look through and have passwords for your phone, it wont work.", ">Trust people when they tell you who they are.\n\nShe has told you she is manipulative by saying the phrase \"you know what would be funny? If we exchanged passwords tihi\" and correct me if I am wrong but there is absolutely no comedic value in this. Ergo she is using dishonesty as a tactic to gain access to your private information. Huge red flag\n\nSecondly she gives you the silent treatment when you go against her wishes. That is emotional abuse to withold affection when you set a boundary.\n\nThirdly, you try to compromise with her by setting some rules that would make this more comfortable for you because you are safekeeping stuff that does not concern her nor is it for her to know. \n\nFourth and most importantly, she is able to access instagram on your phone while you supervise without knowing your password. Demanding to know your password would only serve any purpose if she intended on doing something on your account that she didn't want you to see her doing. Stuff like blocking people and/or commenting stuff under your name.\n\nIf she only wanted to see what you are doing on instagram, having access to it on your phone would be enough.\n\nNothing but red flags here, sorry bro.", "You /can/ keep the relationship and ask/advice her to treat her trust issues, be it with you or with a therapist. However it can not work, she may just not want to do it, and if she decides to do, it just won\u2019t be easy to either of you. It\u2019ll be painful, stressful and hard because it seems she doesn\u2019t see any problem in not trusting you.\nI\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend for almost 6 years and I\u2019ve never felt the need to ask him for his password, expect to do things that he asked me to do because he couldn\u2019t do them at the moment. And that\u2019s because I\u2019ve just always trusted him", "Hey, whatever floats your boat. I'll downvote your difference of opinion too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f nowhere in my thing did i mention OPs individual situation. I was talking directly to the commenter i replied to, otherwise i would've you know... Replied to OP directly? \ud83e\udd14", "I have brought up therapy before which she dismissed, but it was due to other, deeper reasons I rather not get into. Should I bring it up again?", "So it's more trouble than it's worth is what you're suggesting?", "Not really, since I don\u2019t know her nor you, neither do I know how your relationship works. It\u2019s more so that you know it\u2019ll be difficult. If it\u2019s worth it, unfortunately only you can decide.\nAs any relationship, me and my boyfriend had problems simply because we are different individuals. It did hurt and did require effort from both of us, however we worked it through because we both wanted it and deemed our relationship worth it."]}
