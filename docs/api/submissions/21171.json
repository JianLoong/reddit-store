It really is that simple.\n\nThis also isn't extremist. They aren't forcing anyone to do shit. I don't like religious people forcing their religion onto others but I also don't like the opposite...when non religious people force their non religious tendencies and perspectives onto religious people.\n\nThey have the freedom to have a \"modest\" (in their eyes to respect their god the most) dress code at their wedding and their gods home...you also have the freedom to dress how you wish. BUT you sign a social contract automatically when entering the house of god that you either adhere to. Go to a mosque you take off your shoes or leave. Go to a church you respect that specific churches rules or simple the people in it like the ones getting married. That's what you sign automatically. It's different. It's not a pub, a friends house or yours. It's a church.\n\nThey have the freedom to enforce rules to protect their beliefs and respect their god and I will respect that by acting on my own freedom to simply not go and tread on that...be an entitled brat and tell them to deal with it forcing my wants over theirs. My freedom of expression does not trump theirs. They clash. So just dont go.\n\nOverall idc what you think indecency is when it clearly is indecent to the ones getting married and religious people. Which is why I would cover up if I go to a mosque to respect the people there or just not go for example. Don't like the rules at their own wedding or the churches rules then don't expect others to bend their knee to respect and cater to your perspective when it's not about you and noone asked...\n\nThis isn't extremist.

If someone showed a little cleavage, someone might whisper some shit but they would definitely be allowed in.", "Umm, no. Only if you have boobs. If you have titties like me there's usually no cleavage. \n\nI still think it was inappropriate and methinks she wanted to cause a stir. NTA\n\nThere's an asshole here and it's not OP. They just look alike.", "My mom and I were just talking about the \"rules\" earlier today. I grew up in a rural catholic community. You didn't just have to cover shoulders and knees, women had to cover their hair. They no longer inforce the hair requirement and it's funny how many younger people refuse to believe that a Christian church had that rule.", "Catholic here, no we do not have rules against strapless dresses, that is a person thing. Stop using the religious order to justify personal actions. This is a conservative dress mandate in the Church, and the numbers of people doing it are FAR less now than they were.

If they only want people to wear cat costumes to their weddings, then that is their right. \n\n> it\u2019s not cool to call people whackadoodles due to their religion and beliefs.\n\nIt is not cool to think that someone who doesn't follow your religious belief is going to hell, or is an infidel, or unclean.

We were allowed a wide variety of classical music and hymns, but anything pop culture was a no-go.\n\nSince I wanted to be married in that church, I shrugged and rolled with it and chose the music from what was permitted.

It seems her strategy all along was to push her way past the \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d and she found out where that landed her.  \n\nShe wanted to be included in a wedding without having to respect the traditions of the families hosting it.

No bare shoulders, but a boatload of hypocracy. JMHO!!!!", "Agreed though at many Orthodox synagogues to the knee is fine. (Attended one for several years.) \n\nAs well as modesty, not dressing nicely is considered disrespectful. We're actually commanded to dress nicely in honor of Shabbat and that carries over to a simcha like a wedding. \n\nAt my current shul (Conservative) I've seen people come in with uncovered shoulders and not be kicked out because basically, even though it's inappropriate, shaming them is worse. At my childhood synagogue, they absolutely would and at the session for upcoming bar/bat mitzvah kids there was actual guidance about appropriate dress (It was the 90s and those fancy strapless taffeta dresses were in style.

I'm actually saying that men are victims of misogyny too. And I didn't generalize anything like you're suggesting. I only said that in this particular example, misogyny is one of the factors. Along with other reasons, as I said, so I never implied that everything is only because of hatred of women.\n\nAll of the topics you listed are serious issues and it's important to understand the causes and contributors in order to thoroughly address them. Men are less likely to seek or receive mental health treatment because so many view that as weak or not \"manly\". That is misogyny. Misogyny hurts men too.", "But that also means you deal with the consequences of that choice. OPs daughter has some growing up to do.", "It's a phrase. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume your first language isn't English. \n\nMy point is, not everything is misogyny and whatever you claim to be misogyny is actually misandry and specifically the hatred of men and their need to explore emotional and physical options that don't fit their stereotypes. What you've done is a common tactic of looking at male issues and categorising it to make it a female issue. Not understanding and empathising with male issues is one of the foremost reasons of male suicide and what you're doing is contributing to it."]}
