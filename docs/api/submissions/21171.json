For example, you would probably never go to a church with a dress code, boom boycott.", "right, because Jim Crow laws that literally stopped black people from entering places and getting served and forced them to give their bus seats to white people is the same as women having to cover their hair if they WANT TO step inside a RELIGIOUS BUILDING /s\n\nyou are delusional and you give feminism a bad name.", "going to church changes absolutely nothing in your life??? you don\u2019t need to tell ME about black people and oppression, trust me. you do need to stop comparing oranges to apples tho. as a former Catholic, I have twenty million reasons to absolutely hate that dumpster fire of an institution. still not the same and you KNOW it. get mad at organised religion for finding conversion camps, misogynistic laws and covering up abuse. head coverings aren\u2019t it"]}
