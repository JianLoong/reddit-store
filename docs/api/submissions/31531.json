During dinner, Cassie looked over my cousin \u201cMolly\u2019s\u201d shoulder and saw she was reading a webcomic, then Cassie started talking about how the webcomic is overrated, calling Molly \u201cbasic\u201d and making fun of her for reading it.\r  \n\r  \nI was especially irritated because I really like hanging out with Molly but she and her parents are rarely willing to visit in-person because Cassie\u2019s always causing issues like this. I told Cassie that Molly\u2019s allowed to like what she likes and there\u2019s no reason to be rude when Molly wasn\u2019t bothering anyone.\r  \n\r  \nCassie made an excuse like \u201cWell, I\u2019m just being honest\u201d and I told her that she doesn\u2019t have the excuse of \u201cjust being honest\u201d because nobody asked for her opinion in the first place. Cassie got angry and started going off about how \u201cYou may be too dumb to know\u201d but she has free speech and doesn\u2019t need permission to speak, which was literally not the point at all.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom asked me and Cassie to just drop it but Cassie kept trying to get the last word in. I got fed up and snapped at Cassie. I told her she bullies everyone and no one says anything because they don\u2019t want to put up with the drama, but I\u2019m sick and tired of her being a jerk to everyone, which was all something I\u2019ve wanted to tell Cassie for a long time.\r  \n\r  \nCue the yelling and waterworks from \u201cCassie.\u201d She went on about how \u201cno one ever lets me talk!\u201d no one listens to her opinion, blah blah blah. She tried using guilt to get people on her side and the whole night was tense after.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we got home later, my mom told me that I \u201chumiliated\u201d Cassie and that I am in the wrong. She said she knows Cassie is frustrating but I know that\u2019s just how my sister is and I\u2019m supposed to ignore her. And I gave everyone a headache by \u201cprovoking\u201d her and causing the drama of her crying and yelling at Thanksgiving.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s been a week and Cassie is still in a bad mood. I thought what I did was justified, but it seems like Molly is the only person in my family who thinks I did the right thing.

Because everyone is willing to avoid drama by not calling out bad behavior. Not calling out bullying. Not calling out what amounts to abuse. Because this has been going on the entire time. I have come to realize that not only will it not change , but even if you don't like the behavior, you will back and support her. \n\nDue to these things, I will no longer be joining family gatherings where she is there. I will NOT excuse her behavior or that of family that allows her to do so to family. You don't care who she hurts as long as you don't have to deal with the tantrums you all created by allowing her to keep on with this. So to avoid the drama because I refuse to not call her out. Because I refuse to not call the rest of the family out for allowing her to abuse people without consequences. I will be taking a step back as I am unsure if I wish to associate with people enabling abuse. With people who back it, then blame those who don't allow it to continue. That is not family. That is not showing love. That is entitlement to let it happen, so YOU dont have to deal with the monster you created. I will not be part of a family who is not willing to protect family from abuse just so they don't deal with tantrums.\n\nSo I will not be taking calls. Responding to texts. Or taking visits for the foreseeable future while I come to terms with what this means and what I want from this. \n\nThen, I would block them. Hunny, it's time to stop letting her abuse others. To stop going to family who cares more about themselves than to stop her. It's time to take a break to really think if you love them enough, knowing it's not returned to the same extent. That if you return, you are expected to enable and accept abuse. It's time to think is this what you want to see kids taught that family can abuse you, and it's not you that matters. Love you can your family, but at times, you have to walk away from toxic and abusive behavior from all the family.", "NTA at all.

Like go into yourself, ask yourself, what did you achieve by starting this fight? Will Cassie now reflect on her attitude? does everyone praise you to be the hero that saved molly in that situation? Was there anything meaningful to this, or did you just unnecessarily worsen the already bad mood due to cassies mouth? \n\n\nSpeaking of responsibility, your parents, i'm sorry, but frankly, your parents are doing a shit job with their daughter.
