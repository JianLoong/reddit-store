My brother(32) had been staying with her for nearly a year due to him not being able to find a job. He\u2019s been in and out of her place for years. He would find a job not be to keep if for more than a few months and move back in. I suspect alcohol and other issues but my mom is very overprotective of him and so I don\u2019t know the whole story. My sister(42) and I(36) both wanted to sell the house since the market was good and distribute the money equally between all of us. \n\nThat means around $230k per person if it sold at market price. But before that we wanted to replace the flooring and repaint it. We both live hours away so was going to hire a guy. My brother refused to let him enter and also refused to let us sell by essentially squatting there. We didn\u2019t really know what to do because he refused to move and wanted us to let him live there for free until her got a job. We agreed for 3 months he could stay there for free but he never found a job. Or maybe he did and just didn\u2019t tell us. We waited another 3 month before deciding we had to kick him out somehow. We tried to visit once and he barred us from entering saying we didn\u2019t tell him early enough we were coming, even though we told him 2 days ago. \n\nWe agreed to offer him 10% more of the inheritance then his share if he left. I was pretty sure he would take it since he was broke. Nope he refused to move saying he had nowhere to move to and we should just let him stay and he would take care of the place for us. Finally we decided to take to a lawyer and he said we had to give a formal eviction notice. So we went that route and it took 8 months. \n\nHe also painted the rooms black and we paid a lot of money for painters to restore the original color. We got a pretty good sale for it and gave him his amount. I still get random calls of him yelling that ruined his life. I\u2019m done with him and frankly disgusted he refused to leave on his own but AITA?", "created_utc": 1689862130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154ryom/aita_for_suing_my_brother_out_of_our_moms_house/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to grow up.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA!  Ignore/block your brother.  He was never going to find a job and move out.  You did the only thing you could do and, in the end, he benefitted financially from the sale.  Your mom left the house to all of you with no stipulation to allow your mooch of a brother to continue to live there.", "Lawyer was the best route.  Block his calls and emails.  NTA", "NTA. He was squatting on the inheritance.", "NTA. 230K is a nice amount of money. He could find himself a little condo, small house, or trailer and still have some money left over.", "You are not the asshole for suing your brother out of your mom's house. He was a squatter who refused to respect your wishes and the law. He also damaged the property and lied to you. You had every right to evict him and sell the house.\n\nSquatters are people who unlawfully occupy an uninhabited property without the owner's permission. Squatters can be a nuisance and a liability for property owners. They can cause damage, lower the property value, and prevent the owner from selling or renting the property.\n\nThere are different ways to deal with squatters, depending on the situation and your local laws. Some possible strategies are:\n\n- Communicating with the squatter and asking them to vacate the property\n- Posting an eviction notice to the squatter and following the legal process\n- Filing a lawsuit against the squatter and obtaining a court order\n- Offering a cash-for-keys deal to the squatter and paying them to leave\n\nYou don't have to apologize for your decision, but you may want to explain to your brother why his behavior was unacceptable and how it affected you. You may also want to tell him what you expect from him as your brother. You may want to ask him to apologize to you, seek help for his issues, and respect your boundaries.\n\nYou may also want to seek some support from other sources, such as friends, family members, or counselors. You are not alone, and many people care about you and support you.\n\nRemember that you are valid, responsible, and worthy of respect. Your decisions are not something to be questioned or manipulated. They are part of your inheritance and agency. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise.", "NTA , some people never grow up", "Brother essentially tried to screw his sisters out of $230K each. Why would you think you\u2019re in the wrong here?", "NTA\n\nYour brother really needs help and I hope he can get it. I hope he doesn't squander that inheritance on booze and drugs. This is a great opportunity for him to possibly get his life together. $250k can go a long way depending on where you live and hopefully give him a buffer to get his act together.", "NTA. Whatever your brother\u2019s issues, you and your sister were more generous. Block him and move on.", "NTA - unfortunately there really was no other action you could have taken that would have made him happy besides just giving him the house he didn't deserve.", "NTA.  It seems that you and your sister split the inheritance fairly among the three of you. Your brother, obstructed your efforts; and even worse, he painted the rooms a color that he knew you would have to paint over.  \n\nYou did not ruin your bother's life. He did so by his failure to pursue a job while living with your late mother. If he needs help with substance abuse, he should get that help. His share of the inheritance should be more than adequate to tide him over until he finds employment.", "nta", "NTA. Your brother needs to grow up, he's 32 ffs.", "NTA I hope u deducted expenses from his portion", "You\u2019re nicer than me. I would have deducted the painters fee plus any change to the renovation quotes from his share.\n\nNTA", "We didn\u2019t?", "He went to a hotel for the 2 months it took us to fix up the house and sell.

Your NTA for not giving him the house to live in! \n\nSorry if I didn\u2019t make my point clearer!", "That\u2019s more than fair IMO. And if he had the money for a hotel, he is just being a d*ck.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "No he didn\u2019t, we loaned it against the house. He demanded \u201ca nice hotel with a pool\u201d", "He sounds incredibly entitled and you did the right thing. NTA."]}
