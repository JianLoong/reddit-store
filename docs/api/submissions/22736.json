We didn\u2019t really know what to do because he refused to move and wanted us to let him live there for free until her got a job. We agreed for 3 months he could stay there for free but he never found a job. Or maybe he did and just didn\u2019t tell us. We waited another 3 month before deciding we had to kick him out somehow.

Finally we decided to take to a lawyer and he said we had to give a formal eviction notice. So we went that route and it took 8 months. \n\nHe also painted the rooms black and we paid a lot of money for painters to restore the original color.

He was a squatter who refused to respect your wishes and the law. He also damaged the property and lied to you. You had every right to evict him and sell the house.\n\nSquatters are people who unlawfully occupy an uninhabited property without the owner's permission. Squatters can be a nuisance and a liability for property owners. They can cause damage, lower the property value, and prevent the owner from selling or renting the property.\n\nThere are different ways to deal with squatters, depending on the situation and your local laws. Some possible strategies are:\n\n- Communicating with the squatter and asking them to vacate the property\n- Posting an eviction notice to the squatter and following the legal process\n- Filing a lawsuit against the squatter and obtaining a court order\n- Offering a cash-for-keys deal to the squatter and paying them to leave\n\nYou don't have to apologize for your decision, but you may want to explain to your brother why his behavior was unacceptable and how it affected you. You may also want to tell him what you expect from him as your brother. You may want to ask him to apologize to you, seek help for his issues, and respect your boundaries.\n\nYou may also want to seek some support from other sources, such as friends, family members, or counselors. You are not alone, and many people care about you and support you.\n\nRemember that you are valid, responsible, and worthy of respect. Your decisions are not something to be questioned or manipulated. They are part of your inheritance and agency.

It seems that you and your sister split the inheritance fairly among the three of you.

He did so by his failure to pursue a job while living with your late mother. If he needs help with substance abuse, he should get that help.

Our situation was probably worse as he kept breaking in, smoking inside, and dirtying up the house in general. When we finally got him out he sabotaged every open house by showing up and scaring off potential buyers, physically threatened our realtor, yanked for sale signs out of the ground and threw them away, etc. It took 2 years to sell the house and we didn\u2019t get nearly what we should have but we wanted it to end.

Sure you might fall off the wagon and it may be an indication of other mental illnesses, but he has no excuse not to seek treatment for his alcoholism. Even if he needs an initial 30 day in treatment stay at a facility to go through withdrawal, the brother has the funds from his share to do so. He\u2019s choosing not to deal with his issues. It\u2019s not the same as someone who can\u2019t function or won\u2019t be able to afford long term medical expenses for other mental reasons. Plenty of people with alcoholism can hold it together to keep a job. My mom was one of them. She just used to drink and do drugs instead of parenting us after work until she was ready to stay clean. AA is generally free or cheap too. I know because it took my mom until my teens to get clean and only because I threatened to call CPS to to make her lose custody of my siblings to keep my little sisters from having to fight off enabler or dealer boyfriends like I had to.

Older brother doesn't care, so oldest sister got her name off the house so she won't be legally responsible for anything.", "NTA - he ruined his own life.", "Sucks that you had to go that far, but NTA for sure.", "I have no comment about this except the fact that you just made me realize that saying y\u2019all y\u2019all can actually be accurate grammar for how it\u2019s used colloquially.", "It\u2019s the Michigan in me. \ud83d\ude2d", "This! My aunt favored her two boys and were hard on the girls.  The women are doing great and the boys are major underachievers.", "You are very welcome. \ud83d\ude42", "NTA he\u2019d have destroyed the house since he would be too broke to maintain it. It would have been on you and your sister to maintain insurance and taxes had you let him live there free.", "Get an attorney and have them go through the courts to partition the property, the court will force your brother to either buy you out at fair market value or force a sale. NTA", "NTA. You gave him options before going down that route. Needed to be done", "Why though? Color me curious", "NTA. There\u2019s something wrong with him. With $230,000, less taxes, he could rent a place, or move and start over. \n\nThe basic purpose of parenting is to raise an adult who can be successful after you\u2019re gone. Enabling your brother\u2019s behavior did him no favors, because he\u2019s unable to function on his own. He\u2019s never had to.", "Since all three of them owned it, they would all have been on the hook for non-payment. His continuing to be there would have ruined three lives, not just his own.", "No, a lot of assholery is because a lot of people are just assholes", "Yes. You were TA. Why are you calling your brother a squatter or saying he was squatting in the house. I don't like that. He lived there. It was his home. He wasn't a squatter until you legally made him a squatter by evicting him. When you recount this stories to other and rethink how you told it to others consider the verbiage you use and how biased you were. You and your brother were acting selfishly. Only concerned with your own interests with little care for each other and that's not good at all. So what he painted the walls black...he lived there.\n\nBased on your mother allowing him to live with her on and off I assume she would have not been pleased by what you did to him. (I don't know her and I'm sorry if I am way off based in my assumption).\n\nSince your mother passed and I assume didn't leave a will the house belongs to all three of you. It's your brother house just as much as you and your other sibling. Remember that. Over 200k is a good lump of money but it won't replace the home that's being sold. That doesn't trump a rent free house. You and your other sibling have homes and were probably in better financial standings than him. Probably emotional doing better as well. You were being inconsiderate to your brother....that's just the way it is. Giving him an ultimatum to be out within 3 months was cold.\n\nI think you and your other sibling should have your aided your 32yr old brother more and then he might have been more agreeable to sell. For example, find him a reasonable home he could have purchases rather than rent that cost a little over a 100k so he would have had money left over to sustain while he finds a job/working. Giving him a large lump of money with out financial help literacy was not good. Yes he is a grown adult but an extra head and helping hand goes a long way. You could have also soften up with his removal from the home by allowing him to keep some more of the furnitures and other things he might have sentimental value to. Offering him more money (an additional 10%) didn't work because money don't last but a home is a lifetime.", "NTA. My mom's sister did the same, didn't want to leave after my grandma passed. She has spent her entire life jumping from job to unemployment to another job, often time leeching of my grand-parents' kindness. \n\nShe doesn't get retirement money because she's barely paid into social security during her entire life. Her hope was to wait until she could get the mandatory minimum that the states gives to every elderly person after 65, and then she'd leave (don't believe that for a second).\n\nEventually, my mom and her siblings put the house up for sale, and she had to leave.\n\nI used to love her when I was a kid because she was the fun one. Always hitch-hiking, had \"fun\" artist friends (drunks or drug addicts), etc.\n\nNow I realize that she was just the immature one, not the fun one. She was fun to kids because she was all play and no work.", "What makes him undeserving? What makes op more deserving to do what he wants with the house than the brother? Weird take", "He lived there. It wasn't like he did anything wrong by painting it to his taste.... you wouldn't be in your right to charge to make cosmetic changes you saw fit to make just because you don't like nlavk paint.", "His siblings and parent stood by and watched. They enabled and didn't help. Just pass judgment and shoved money at him so he could go away.", ">NTA. It seems that you and your sister split the inheritance fairly among the three of you. Your brother, obstructed your efforts; and even worse, he painted the rooms a color that he knew you would have to paint over. \n\nHe likely did it to derail potential buyers.", "Brother wouldn't even let the others visit. The siblings outnumbered and outvoted him, but he didn't care. The guy is selfish, greedy, and wanted the house all to himself. He never deserved that.", "No, they had a house and he was trying to keep it all for himself", "If he was an addict. They could have used his part of the inheritance to get him admitted to a facility to get clean. Or help him some how to manage his inheritance. Like buy him a home and give it to him in installments.", "But it's ok for the other brother to be bullied out of his home by his siblings. They told him to get out after 3 months that's cold.", "They gave him his share of 230k to get a new place - boo hoo", "He didn't do everything right morally."]}
