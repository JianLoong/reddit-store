Your dad is enabling your brother\u2019s bad behavior and gaslighting you big time.", "NTA.\n\nShould I touch a stove that looks hot and burned me last time? No", "NTA.  Wise move.", "The fact that your brother responded the way he did after your refusal is a clear indication, IMO, that your gut feeling was right.", "Your dad gave HORRIBLE advice. Just to \u201cprevent drama\u201d isn\u2019t ok. What if the bank asks about fraudulent charges? You say you gave your info to your brother, they wouldn\u2019t care. NTA - do not let your fam abuse you and your kindness", "Y'all, I am tired of seeing this \"to prevent drama\" crap.  \nCAUSE THE DRAMA. INVITE IT. START ROCKING THE BOAT.  ANARCHY AND CHAOS. lol", "NTA. No one is entitled to something of yours that you don't want to give, especially when you're being generous by paying for their food. Sadly, family is often ungrateful like that. \n\nPetty me would open a new account with a different card that only has a small amount of money, and next time give him those details.\n\nIf he only orders the food and never uses it afterwards, then you know he can be trusted without being out more money than was offered. Great outcome. \n\nBut if he does try to use it later, not only will it not have any money for him to use and you to lose, but you will have clear proof that you were right to not trust him.\n\nOn a sidenote, this also works great for all your subscriptions and automatic withdrawals, I.e scummy gym memberships that try to withdraw money after a membership is cancelled, or being difficult about ending said membership.", "NTA\n\nAsk your dad why he isn't paying the original stolen money back. If he has changed.\n\nThe reasoning here makes me think the dad is high as the stars.", "NTA. fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. OP did the right thing.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give anyone your credit card information, especially someone who has stolen from you in the past", "NTA.\nYour brother could have used his own card or accepted your other offers, the only one that made it difficult was himself.", "NTA\n\n>When he asked why I told him because last time he had my card information on his phone he used it a bunch and never paid me back. He gave the excuse that he was a kid back then and he wouldn\u2019t do that now.\n\nThieves be thieving. The only reason he would need your credit card info and refuse a transfer is to steal. \n\n>He also pointed out that money transfer apps take a couple days for the money to move\n\nDo you guys not know about direct money transfers from bank accounts? They are instantaneous.", "\\> dad told me I should have just gave him my card to prevent drama\n\n\"Then *you* give him *your* credit card info if you don't want drama with an obvious thief. Quit whining. Go ahead. I dare you.\"", "NTA. But your brother and father are.", "> He also pointed out that money transfer apps take a couple days for the money to move \n\nYou can log onto your bank app and transfer money that will be in the recipients account in 30 seconds", "NTA you dads not making sense. Let\u2019s say for the sake of argument it does take time to transfer money, which it doesn\u2019t, has he paid you back at all since then? If he STILL doesn\u2019t have the money you\u2019d be a fool to give him the opportunity to steal from you again. You dad seemed to gloss over the fact that what he did was essentially steal from you, even if he had paid it back. Taking someone\u2019s money without their permission is stealing. Paying it back would have nice, to show he had no intention of out and out stealing, but he didn\u2019t even do that.", "Dad needs to give his son his credit card info.", "parents should stay out of kid's business and adults should not include parents for something that trivial.\n   i have 6 adult kids.", "Transfers, in my experience, take a matter of seconds, so a nonsense excuse anyway.  Best not let temptation get in his way.  NTA.", "Exactly. He got away with it last time so why not. The correct response to him claiming he\u2019s now mature and responsible would have been to say \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019ve finally realized the error of your ways, would you prefer to PayPal or Venmo me for the amount you still owe me from before?\u201d A decent, reformed person would want to right their wrongs and have a clean slate now that they\u2019re capable of realizing their previous behavior was unacceptable/criminal.", "YDTA (Your Dad is The Asshole) Who tells their daughter she's a horrible sister over something like this? Was your brother a horrible sibling when he used your info to buy himself things AND then didn't pay the money back?", "In Australia, you can just do bank to bank transfers.  It is instant if you are with the same bank.  \n\nFor instance,  if my kids are short for the bus fare I can transfer money straight to their debit card account.", "In Australia we have instant transfers too, large amounts take a few days but a few hundred or less anywhere from instant to 5 minutes", "Sir, this is a Wendy's", "Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow!", "If it's no big deal, dad can cover for brother.\n\n(1) there's no reason to share CC numbers. Its poor practice even between trustworthy family members.\n\n(2) OP and brother are both adults. Father no longer has any standing to adjudicate between them. It's strictly between brother and OP. Dad butt out.", "How much was it last time? Doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201ccouple of dollars\u201d to me. \n\nAlso, NTA.", " He doesn\u2019t need it. My fianc\u00e9 has his card info saved in a couple of my food apps. I accidentally used it once because he had paid for the previous time. Luckily it was only like $3 because I was using points for something free and just got a drink in addition but I immediately sent him a message so he knew the charge was me and apologized and asked if he needed me to send him money for it. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to accidentally use someone else\u2019s info and he has on purpose used your info before. Don\u2019t give it to him.", "Sounds like dad plays favorites. Sorry OP.", "Tell ur dad if he's willing to sign something to the effect that u can hold him liable for any money ur bother scams off ur credit card ud be willing to do it.

NTA, if anything ur brother AND ESPECIALLY DAD are.", "How much did your brother take from you in the past?\nAlso, it seems your dad is obviously playing favorites and I don\u2019t think any word he says to you should be worth it.

Your obviously NTA, but your dad and brother need to get their crap together.", "if youre in the US i believe taking $700 or over is a felony", "Wow.  That's terrible.", "Canada too, we call them e-transfers.", "Osko and PayID are instant with any bank, I don\u2019t even have a card attached to my main bank account anymore.
