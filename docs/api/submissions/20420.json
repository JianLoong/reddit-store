I only purchase things now that I\u2019m okay paying for. \n\nYou are so right to draw the line now that both of you are adults. Setting a few boundaries now will keep the peace going forward.", "NTA, me and my sister love each other, but if my sister was like \"no im not putting my card on your phone\" id be like \"cool, you dont like other people having access to your cards, thats a reasonable boundary and as someone who cares about you im gonna respect that\"", "You might want to give your farther this expression \u201cFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\u201d.  NTA for being smart!", "NTA - NEVER EVER give credit card deets to ANYONE family included mistakes can and do happen", "NTA. \n\nGoing to go out on a limb here and guess that your parents brushed over a lot of bad behavior from your brother over the years (and expected you to do the same). Not just the credit cards. Basically enabling him to never he held accountable for his behavior.", "NTA - Next time tell your dad to use his credit card and you will Venmo him the money.", "The only reason I could think of is if he was paying with a credit card that was near max, OP transferring him money wouldn\u2019t help because it takes a couple days for a CC payment to reflect in the balance. But that\u2019s super specific and considering his history unlikely.", "NTA, ask them if they would have preferred it if you let him steal and then report him for fraud.", "Yeah and instant transfers are a thing", "I had faith in my family until all 3 siblings fucked me over financially. Now, the only person I will loan money to is the hubs. I never have to worry about getting it back. The only person I will ever give money to is my kid. Idk about anyone else, but when I had the kid, I decided to change what I didn't like and keep what I did like about my upbringing and applied it to them. My parents were paycheck to paycheck, and even that was no guarantee because of addiction. So, in our adult years, we knew not to ask for help. I didn't want my kid to feel the same way. From the minute  the kid took their 1st breath, I put him and his needs before mine, and it'll stay like that til I die.", "This should be the top comment. Btw thanks for the serious laugh with the Brother Bandit comment.", "And Daddy would've sided with the brother and made excuses for him but wouldn't  have offered to pay it back.", "No she remained neutral. She didn\u2019t want to get involved because it was pointless drama and she didn\u2019t want to add to it. You\u2019re being ridiculous.", "Your dad seems to favor/baby your brother. So you have to give your brother your bank info and he doesn\u2019t just say to him \u201cit\u2019s just a couple dollars, why not treat your sister?\u201d Complete bull. Id throw the whole dad and brother away. It\u2019s not cool your mom stayed neutral.", "I hate to ask, but how much was it, roughly?", "\"If it's no big deal, why don't you pay me what he owes, pops?\"", "If your dad said it\u2019s no big deal then he can pay you what your brother owed you. Stealing isn\u2019t something you brush under the table, it\u2019s something you stomp out before it becomes a habit.", "\"Excellent! Then lets get it done and dusted now, no time like the present!\"", "Oh wow! For sure next time if this issue arises again you should tell your father to give his card information to your brother, like he said \"its only a couple dollars, its no big deal\" and see how he fumbles his words.", "When bad people call me bad [things] I feel vindicated. You should be happy you upset your dad in this matter.", "Your dad sucks.", "Ugh, I'm so sorry. Cut the monies to your family; they don't appreciate it and are actively trying to steal from you.", "I wish I could give this more than one upvote.", "Yes!!! This!! Dad is favouring the son and enabling him, OP NTA.", "Brother is a boy.  Pillaging his sibling\u2019s funds is ok.  I\u2019m the only person in my family that\u2019s ever gotten my older brother to repay a debt.  My mother wished I\u2019d let it go, nope!", "I mean...if it's the same bank it could take a matter of seconds. External bank to external bank takes a little longer because of the verification process. OP's still NTA no matter what though.", "In the UK it's pretty much instant regardless of if you are will the same bank. I wonder what part of the past OPS dad is living in", "The bank I use here (U.S.) lets you do bank to bank transfers.", "Canada too.", "Exactly. Any time anyone says \"It's only a few dollars! It's not a big deal!\" the response should be \"Okay, if it's not a big deal then pay me back.\"", "Right? I\u2019ve never gotten that excuse not to do anything if it\u2019s not a big deal then do it.", "Mom's enabling him too.  Staying \"neutral\" between a criminal and his victim is enabling the criminal.", "I did the same years ago with my grandma's credit card.  I paid her back as soon as I realized I had more money in my account and figured out that her card was charged instead of mine. I had her card it on my paypal because she had asked me to order something online for her. \n\nI paid her back right away and made sure her card information was removed so the accident wouldn't happen again.", "I had no idea my own phone saved that info. I finally gave in and stopped taking it out because it's easier. That is the point I know...but yes my kids and I had th I s same thing. They just bought me something next time.", "But they're faaammmiiilllyyy! Yes, I'm being sarcastic!", "I absolutely trust my brother with my life. (Like literally, he would make my medical decisions if I were incapacitated.) And my brother and I do what OP and her brother were doing all the time. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got a free delivery coupon in my app, let\u2019s place the order on my phone!\u201d We always just Venmo back and forth. It would never occur to me to ask for his credit card number or to him to ask for mine. It\u2019s just fucking wild to me that anyone would 1) ask and 2) be upset when they were told no.", "Also I want to add, your brother abused your info in the past. You don\u2019t just get trust, you earn it. He needs to build that trust again and I personally wouldn\u2019t trust them after abusing it before. It makes absolutely no sense why he would need your card info. If he\u2019s so pressed about getting the money from your meal maybe he shouldn\u2019t be ordering at all. I\u2019m sorry for that, just reading your story makes me so mad on your behalf \ud83d\ude02 do not sweat what they say. Dear old dad can give your brother his bank account info and see how he likes it", "The felony amount varies from state to state.", "I gave it one for you", "That\u2019s not enabling, it\u2019s just being clueless", "That's a brilliant idea", "Exactly. We flick each other money all the time and using Osko it\u2019s instant. So no reason brother needs your card.", "And my axe.", "Me three bro", "And you have my bow", "You have my sword", "And your brother!", "And my glock", "Good thing because my Sig is locked away."]}
