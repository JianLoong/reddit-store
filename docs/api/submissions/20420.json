I offered to pay for everyone\u2019s meals and my brother offered to use his app since he got free delivery. I told him to tell me the price of the order and I\u2019d send him the money. He wanted me to just give him my credit card information. I said I\u2019d rather just send him the direct amount. When he asked why I told him because last time he had my card information on his phone he used it a bunch and never paid me back. He gave the excuse that he was a kid back then and he wouldn\u2019t do that now. I still refused and he told me to use my own phone which I did with no problem. I ordered our food and the rest of the afternoon went well, my brother was cold to me but I didn\u2019t care. \n\nBefore I left or dad told me I should have just gave him my card to prevent drama. I replied that my brother could have just taken the money to prevent drama. I also added that my brother had nothing to be mad about; he got his food, he didn\u2019t have to pay and he still had his free delivery. The only reason he is mad is because his plan to steal my credit card information failed. My father then called me a horrible sister and said I should have more faith in my brother. He also pointed out that money transfer apps take a couple days for the money to move and my brother probably didn\u2019t gave the funds to cover the cost at the moment.

I don\u2019t know why your dad thought it would be a good idea to get in the middle of it, but he shouldn\u2019t have. This is especially true since your brother has stolen from you before.

There is no reason to have it.\nNot sure where you live or what apps you use to transfer money to people, most are instant where I live.

Your brother helped himself before. First time it's his fault. Second time yours. NTA", "NTA, your brother wanted your card so he could use it.

Because he knows your brother lies and steals and he's too much of a wienie to handle your brother like a father should and would rather make it your fault instead.\n\nGood for you for not risking your money with a bad actor.
