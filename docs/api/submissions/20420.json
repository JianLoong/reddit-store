NAH, your brother made a reasonable request and you reasonably denied it, your dad acted protectively of the relationship between his children and everyone moved on.", "It\u2019s not up to you to prevent his paddy. You remained firm with your boundaries. All he had to do was accept it.", "If your brother is a different person now than he was as a kid, he would of paid you back the money he owed you. He never did. \nYou have nothing to be sorry for. \nDad knows this is the answer too, but he is protecting your brother from looking bad rather than protecting you from being scammed.  If this is your dads MO, maybe that\u2019s why your brother is this way.", "NTA Credit card info is not something to mess around with", "NTA. You'd be an idiot to give him the details in the hope that he has grown out of stealing from you! Your father is being an A H for making you out to be the bad one here. He may not have the best ethics either. Stand by your common sense approach and don't let them browbeat you.", "NTA! He has **stolen** money from you in the past.

Like at all. In the best case scenario he was trying to use his promo code and feel like he was helping or even use this as an opportunity to show that he\u2019s gonna pay you back (I\u2019m just saying like absolutely best case scenario) and even then you don\u2019t owe him squat\u2026 not because you suspect him of anything just because that\u2019s your private info.", "NTA.

This means you shouldn't give it out to anyone except for a spouse/partner that you trust completely and with whom you share joint finances. Even then, you are completely responsible for watching everything that happens with it whether you use it or they use it. \n\nNot only are you responsible for everything they buy with it, but you are also responsible for anything someone else buys with it if they share it or let it get stolen. You also reap the damage to your credit if you can't pay it back or if it takes you time to pay it back.\n\nWe don't even have to know the past with your brother. All we have to know is that sharing credit is a deeply personal financial decision, one that should only take place if you have a trusted and ongoing partnership with someone. \n\nI agree with posters who say Dad should have put up his card if he truly was ignorant enough about credit safety to think that was a good decision. He seems quite happy to keep his own credit cards (if he has any) safe from your brother. Maybe he could put his number on one of my apps?", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t lose sleep over the opinions of those two. Your brother AND your dad are both the problem.

If your dad is so keen to share credit card details, tell him he can give baby bro HIS info next time.", "NTA, trust is earned. He broke it and hasn't earned it back. Simple as that. Giving him your credit info when he's already proven able to misuse it, would be stupid. Especially if he never paid you back or apologized. And saying: I was a kid, doesn't count as an apology.

He obviously don't respect you, stop listening to him", "The OP has been asked several times what the amount was that brother stole in the past. As far as I know that hasn't been answered. I think it's more important to understand how long ago it was. If he really was a kid, is he ever going to be forgiven for that? I'll admit I'm a little salty about this, I was a scatterbrained kid and quite frequently shoved change in my pocket and promptly forgot about it. My family made this into a big deal that was brought up well into adulthood. \"No don't give her a $20 bill you'll never see your change!\" I wasn't stealing when I was a kid and I certainly wasn't going to take their change as an adult. But sure let's bring it up 20 years later.\n\nAlso depending on the brother's current age and financial situation, I think there could be legit reasons why it would be easier to enter a credit card than to pay and get reimbursed. Of course the easiest thing and the safest was exactly what they did, which is to have the OP make the order. They just lost out on free delivery but avoided a headache. I think there's some family ghosts lurking around adding muddy footprints to this landscape.\n\nMy judgment is a NTA but it's dad who is the asshole in my estimation, not the brother.", "Isn't there laws stating that you cannot let other individuals know the informations of your card or allow them to use it to pay for stuff, even with your approval?
