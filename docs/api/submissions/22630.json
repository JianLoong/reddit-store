You are right to keep out of it.", "NTA. You're not the parent and you've been asked to not interfere.

Your mom asked that she handles it because she's the parent, not you. She's correct on having you stay out of it as she doesn't want to create more issues at your end. Please be there for your mom when she needs your advice such as the researching tips, and everything else you just mentioned.

It would be way more suitable to tell him to get more involved if he isnt happy with how its going, or rather that he should be more involved regardless. If he wants to have an opinion, he needs to be involved and present, otherwise he can fuck off.", "Maybe its due to me knowing the details of their relationship but he is not just sitting on the sidelines its just that they would both fight over their different points of views in parenting and non of them is willing to compromise with the other but I understand what you are saying, and I'm slightly sensitive to my father getting the blame because once again I see both of their actions and I know a lot of details"]}
