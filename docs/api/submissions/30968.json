Your parents and sister are just embarrassing themselves.", "\"I'd rather just not have an engagement party at all than play along with this weird fantasy.\"\n\nAgreed. NTA  You are clearly not the favorite in your family.", "NTA. Either don't have the engagement party, or if you do, have someone else host it, like your fianc\u00e9's family or even your friends. That way your parents are completely excluded from the planning and have zero control over it. If your sister does show up and makes an ass out of herself, then that's on her and your parents (for mollycoddling her).\n\nIf your parents want to perpetuate this idea that she's engaged, that's on them. Everyone else will see if for what it is; a desperate attention grab by your sister and your parents favoritism of her. \n\nDraw your boundaries now and hold firm otherwise you'll be forced to share with her the rest of your adult life.", "NTA A promise ring? It's a little high school and it's a symbol of what? Your sister's boyfriend confirmed he has no plans to ask your sister to get married.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for not wanting a combined soiree but I also don't see the harm. Yes, it's a little weird your parents are indulging your sister's fantasy and want to have a combined party but I guess I'm like your fiance, I don't mind a little weird every now and then.\n\nWhat is concerning is whatever fantasy scenario your sister is living in will come crashing down at the party when her boyfriend repeatedly confirms to guests they have no immediate plans to be come engaged or married. It may become a source of embarrassment and disappointment for your sister.\n.", "NTA. Your parents are also enabling her. Your sister can \u201cshit, or get off the pot\u201d.  She is, or she isn\u2019t. If she is, she can throw her own party.", "NTA, I always cringe a little when I hear of anyone older than 17 getting a promise ring. Clearly it was a \"shut up ring\" and he has no intention of ever marrying her.\n\nI'm sorry that you haven't been able to have things that are your own. You deserve to be celebrated without having your sister tacked on by default.", "Pull out of the party, they know very well that it isn\u2019t an engagement and they also know that in order for the party to have any legitimacy, you have to be one of the guests of honours- because you are the only one only engaged. If they throw her a party alone, people will talk and ask questions and will probably talk about how desperate and ridiculous it is for a grown woman to celebrate a promise ring.

Your family is being weird and desperate and it is not a good look. \nNta", "NTA looks like a golden child situation to me. Ask your sister when her wedding will be at the party\u2026 in front of everyone.

He is either going to squash it or he's ok pretending so they can get gifts, IMO.", "NTA.  She isn't engaged!  What's next???  A shared wedding??", "NTA, set the bar now because this is the tenderizer, get ready to plan your entire f@cking wedding with your parents saying they will pay a good portion, then them pulling the rug out if you don\u2019t make it a double wedding.\n\nHost your own sh!t, don\u2019t involve your parents as anything more than guests, if they push back, they can sit the engagement party out and see if they want to play chicken with your wedding.", "NTA. I'd say call a family meeting. Have your fiance, parents, sister and sisters bf in the room. Start discussing the engagement party. Then drop in a question to the bf. Something like would you like 1 cake or 2 to celebrate the engagements. \n\nThis is sneaky and possibly nuclear. You could also outright say, you don't want to share so they can have the party.", "Nta but sounds like the family is trying to force your sister's bf into an engagement.", "NTA.  Do NOT share your *engagement* party with your sister even if she does get engaged...which she is not according to her bf.  Die on this hill.", "NTA- don\u2019t have the engagement party. You can party and celebrate your engagement in other ways like through your own Christmas party or something you and your new fianc\u00e9 can have complete control.", "You may need to get sister\u2019s bf involved.  Get him to object, to your parents.  Saying, \u201cbut we aren\u2019t engaged\u201d.  \n\nMaybe start singing \u201chappy not an engagement party to you\u201d.  But that would be obnoxious.", "So what happens if and when your sister DOES get engaged?  Does she get her own party then?  Engagement parties are a time to celebrate engagements, not middle school promises.  NTA.  Your parents are being ridiculous.  Besides, won't your sister be embarrassed talking about her \\*not\\* engagement?", "Be honest with your parents. Tell them that you are afraid that it will be REALLY embarrassing for your sister to have to repeatedly explain to the party guests that she's STILL not actually engaged and at her age got a \"promise ring\", and the second hand embarrassment YOU will feel will spoil the party for your and your fiance.  DO express your disappointment that your parents for some reason are choosing to NOT celebrate YOU and this major life event-- and while it makes you very sad and you honestly don't understand their reasoning ,you accept that it's their money and thus their choice. \n\nPlan a small party of your own or with your finace's parents.  \n\nNTA and BEST WISHES to you and your future husband. PRO TIP expect your sister to become increasingly difficult as your wedding planning progresses.", "NTA. Take some time and pick which hill to die on. They seem pretty dug in to their delusion, and even if you throw your own engagement party you will be facing constant uphill battles right up to the wedding. Of course if it was me, I\u2019d agree to the party but tell all my friends to ply sisters promised one with alcohol and continuously pepper him with questions about their engagement, details of how he proposed, when they\u2019re tying the knot, has he picked his wedding party etc etc until he explodes in public. But I\u2019m a b that way.", "Go ahead and have the party with her and watch the FIREWORKS when her BF explodes as she announces they are getting married. What a fun thing to watch as she say \"we are getting married!!!!\" Only to watch her BF walk away and never come back.

They wanna pressure your sister's bf to get married. \n\nYour sister is blind with this relationship and its future. Dont know if she really dont see it or if she just dont want to see it.\n\nThe boyfriend. If he doesnt want to get married, thats ok. But he has to come clean with the girl. He is leading her on, giving a 30yo a promisse ring!!!! Wft? His parents in law are litteraly planning a engagement party for them, the gf is planning her wedding and he has the nerves to act like nothing happens!?\n\nYou have a very simple solution. Have a engagment party that is not paid for your parents. Dont need to be an over the top thing, just a simple dinner. They can be upset all they want. But if they arent paying for it, they have no say in it.", "NTA but pay for the party yourself. They can\u2019t hold the celebration hostage if they\u2019re not fronting the money for it. Your money your decision. \n\nMake a ton of finger foods, offer a set amount of alcohol (spiked punches & fun drinks cut the cost of booze WAY down because they\u2019re easier to water down lol), throw a playlist together on Spotify and rent an inexpensive venue if you don\u2019t want it at home. Then party to your little hearts\u2019 content.", "NTA.  Personally I\u2019d just sit down with your parents and hash this out.  Officially only you are engaged so if it is an engagement party it is only for you and your partner.  If they do not agree then cancel it if you are not happy.  Your sister trying to piggyback onto your engagement party is an absolute non starter.", "NTA - I'm not one of these brides should get their day/month/year enthusiasts but there are certain life events which are about you more than others.

To actually not have the man who sis is supposedly engaged to there? That is a sure way for people to start asking questions, lol. Refuse to participate in this farce.

If you don't want to share, why not just pay for it yourself? It'll be your money and you won't have to follow anyone's rules. I feel really bad for your sister, though. She's giving herself false hope and forcing her boyfriend for marriage.", "This is just bizarre. Presumably your sister's boyfriend would have to be there if it's an engagement party for them. So how would that work? Every time someone congratulates him, he looks confused and says they're not engaged?\n\nImagine the toasts! lol\n\nNTA.", "Tell your parents that respectfully they should talk to sisters bf first. Because I doubt he\u2019d appreciate being thrown into an engagement party when he didn\u2019t propose.  Or ask him to speak to your mom snd dad about this. It\u2019s not sisters place to force an engagement. That\u2019s what she\u2019s doing and could result in her being single. They are stupid to move forward this way.", "NTA: Honestly that your parents are calling you out for wanting to \"exclude\" your sister is insane, if anything you might quite well be saving her from the embarrassment that she will encounter at the party. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your sister has some issues that she needs to work through because her thinking that a promise ring is pretty much her \"engagement ring\" is delusional, also the fact that she has waited this long and he didn't propose yet probably suggests that he wants to break up but is too uncomfortable himself because she obviously has abandonment issues.\n\nKeep strong and Carry on OP, good luck!", "NTA- that dude is making a fool out of your sister and the nicest thing to do would be to bring it to light.

Don't ask or accept any money from them in the future without it being an emergency. I say this because the next step is wedding planning, maybe not now, maybe in a year or two, but any money for your wedding offered by them comes with strings attached. \n\nYour sister will either still be with that guy, and your parents will hold their money over your head to \"share\" your wedding with your sister, or he'll cave to presure, propose, get engaged and you'll be harassed to \"share\" your wedding with them. 3rd option is less likely: he or she might get fed up with the situation, break up, and your parents will try and be on your case to postpone your wedding because your sister would be heartbroken and it wouldn't be fair.", "Just host your own party.  If no one else pays for your party then you have no one to answer to.  Adults should pay for their own parties and not have parents foot the bill. \n\nBut NTA.
