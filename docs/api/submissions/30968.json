(cuz i imagine even if OP and fiance opt out of the party, sister and parents would opt to continue with it.)", "Maybe they are calling his bluff and want him out of the picture.  \n\nI doubt it and this would be an extreme way of doing it.", "I pictured it more like Hannibal Lecter getting rolled to meet the senator.", "So many people are going to laugh at her behind her back, and so many people are going to gossip once they congratulate the bf on his engagement, and he replies with \"we're not engaged\".

And she and her parents don't want him there - I suppose because they are afraid that he would be loudly announcing that they're not engaged.", "Yeah it's baffling to me. \nYour life is meaningless without a piece of paper and a ring?!?\n\nIf you've got good friends, a job you enjoy and a loving partner you share your life with, then life is pretty meaningful to me.", "Twins. 1 of each.

Cheers everyone!!", "Yes please", "When I was a kid in the late 60s/early70s, \"promise rings were for 1) religious young couples (between ages of 15-18) to allow themselves to feel okay about having pre-marital sex, \"it's okay because we are going to get married when we can\",  2) couples when boy was 18 but girl was only 16 or 17. There was always a chance the young man could get drafted, or had even already been drafted, but the girl's father was not going to allow them to get \"officially engaged\" before the guy left for basic training because the girl was just not old enough, in her parents' view, 3) the guy had a part-time job (so could afford to buy a promise ring) and wanted to send a signal to the rest of the world that he was \"in love and very serious about this relationship so keep your mitts of my girl!\", or 4) the young people were members of a strict religion which discouraged any physical contact such as hand-holding and side hugs, without the young people being \"courting\" (exclusively dating with the intention of marriage).  No self-respecting girl would wear a \"promise ring\" past the age of 22 unless the guy who put it on her finger had re-enlisted or was MIA or KIA. Why is a girl in her late 20s wearing a promise ring?", "I really hope not. As you say, it would be taking things to the extreme. All I can think is that this is some incredibly dumb scheme to get the guy to actually propose. Like they're convinced that he'll suddenly decide to ask her to marry him once he learns that everyone already thinks they're engaged.", "\\* Cue", "I'm on board!", "This should be the top comment.
