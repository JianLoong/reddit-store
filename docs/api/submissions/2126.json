I'm going to wipe my brother's debt to me as his Christmas gift", "selftext": "My (28f) brother (26) asked me to borrow $1k about 4 months ago and swore that he'd pay me back.

Lately he's been mentioning feeling guilty about not being able to pay me back, he can't even afford to give me small increments here and there, which is fine, but when I tell him don't worry about it that just seems to make him feel worse. With Christmas coming up I feel like he'd maybe accept me telling him he doesn't have to pay me back if I pose it as a Christmas gift, but I feel like that's kind of an asshole thing to do, almost as if I'm throwing it in his face.

But I think you\u2019d be well served to do something cute to let him know while exchanging gifts. Idk what that may be, but a small token gift with a note or something relaying the message may help keep it feel in the holiday spirit and less charitable. \n\nYou\u2019re very thoughtful and your brother is lucky. Enjoy the upcoming holiday season!", "NTA. But if you exchange gifts as a family, at least give him something to open (doesn't have to be extravagant) and privately let him know that you've forgiven his debt.", "NAH, but why not ask him about it? Something in the vein of \"Bro I was thinking about Christmas coming up, and you feeling so bad about that debt - I wanna forget about it, but if it would make you feel better we can make this a Christmas gift\". You get the gist.\n\nThen if he says it should be a gift, you get him a small token gift because it's Christmas. Or a bigger gift - you decide.", "NAH but don't do this. If you don't care about the repayment, then let it go.  Eventually he will either pay or let it go as well.\n\nMaking him feel like a charity case at Christmas would be a terrible \"gift.\"", "Nah, but don't do it. He generally is concerned about being a disappointment to you, means he actually cares, if you really want to help him, do it in other more solid ways, help him find a better job, or manage his spending better or something, and then let him pay you back... It will be more solid and fulfilling", "NTA\n\nCan you get $1,000 in Monopoly money or something and wrap it up?

You'll give him an extra month of peace.  Still get him a small gift about equal to what he can gift you.

Instead, it was positioned and accepted by both as a loan.\n\nIf anything, OP could invite the brother to a nice lunch sometime in the future or whatever and discharge the loan then---but not at Christmas or on his birthday as a \"gift.\"", "It is a gift tho.\n\nGift of lifting this *seemingly* ever bothering burden off of him.\n\n>But OP could have said all that when he gave the money, and that's how I would have done it.\n\nThis just tells how financially well off you are.( I know OP doesnt care either) but its not any less good deed to help siblings with a loan, instead of just giving it free. The loan is still Interrest free and not expected to pay until they actually can do that."]}
