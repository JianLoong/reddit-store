She's sweet, she's polite, and so far as i can tell, they seem to have something pretty stable for people their age. Because of this, we don't really mind when she hangs out at our house with her grandparents permission when there's no school the next day. \n\nIssue is, she's not in a very stable home life. She's safe, but she's in that rough adjustment period of not understanding why her parents don't have custody of her anymore, and she doesn't like how strict her grandparents are. Been there done that, so i understand WHY she immediately bonded with any pair of safe adults. She tried calling me \"dad\" casually while i was cooking dinner with her and my son chatting at the kitchen table. I said \"lol im not your dad but \\*item she was looking for\\* is under the sink\" trying to play it off but still set that boundary in case she didnt do it on accident.\n\nshe was quiet for the rest of the evening, i didn't know why until my son said that she was upset over me not letting her call me dad. I said I'm not her dad, and its really not appropriate for her to call some adults she really doesnt know that well \"mom\" and \"dad\", as it could put me and my wife in a tricky situation with her actual parents and guardians. (they've only been dating three months, and this is the first month she's really been getting to know me and my wife) I told him she's welcome to make up a goofy adjacent if she likes, or even \"uncle\", but i wasnt comfortable with her setting me up as her dad in her mind just yet. \n\nHe asked how it was different from him calling me that, and i explained that because i know him well, am his primary caregiver, and love him like a son after we bonded for a long time, it was a little different from him coming over a couple times and deciding he just likes me enough to call me a parental figure. He kinda gets it now, he explained it to her to help her feel better, and my wife is on the same page. Im just wondering if i did the right thing, im new to teens in general, so this is very new emotional territory for me. I dont want to hurt this poor kid, i know what she's going through, i just need to know if what i did was appropriate, because adults being comfy with getting \"reverse adopted\" right away kinda gives me an ick, but it could just be a thing from my own past. Idk ya'll, help me out, im lost here", "created_utc": 1678978893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11swkz9/aita_for_telling_my_fosteradopted_sons_girlfriend/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry to hear that she doesn\u2019t have a good home life, but she can\u2019t call you dad unless you are comfortable with it. And I think you handled it well. You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s reactions, only your own actions. You were respectful. And I think it\u2019s good that you addressed it immediately.", "NTA\u2014 this was incredibly astute of you. I grew up in foster care, and this is an unbelievably complicated situation. And I can tell from your relationship with your son that you\u2019re a thoughtful person, so to tell her this had to be a little heart-wrenching as well. But what happens if you allow her to call you dad, and then she and your son break up? Not saying that you\u2019d be cruel or go no contact, but it will compound her abandonment issues, and further teach her that her relationship with her parents and the people who love her is contingent on their relationship with other things (like addiction) or people (her relationship with your son). You did good.", "\"I said I'm not her dad, and it's really not appropriate for her to call some adults she really doesn't know that well \"mom\" and \"dad\", as it could put me and my wife in a tricky situation with her actual parents and guardians.\"  That pretty much sums it up.  It sounds like you have succeeded in making you home a safe place, but you can't put yourself in that father role yet.  NTA.  (Of course, I don't think anyone called you an AH here.)", "NTA. I hate being called \"Mum\" by strangers. I don't have children. \n\nIt's probably a bit more sensitive of a topic because of the family dynamic, but you don't like it so she shouldn't do it. Simple as that.", "NAH, I think you and your family sound so sweet, and they are lucky to have you. Being able to bring her some stability even in the absence of her calling you dad is tremendous.", "NTA. Boundaries are important for her, too.", "NAH\n\nBesides her bad home life, perhaps consider that she really just didn't know what else to call you. \n\nWhen I was a kid, it was very common for us to say \"Mom\" or \"Dad\" to whoever's parents we were near. We were too close for \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\", but calling someone's parent by their first name was very uncomfortable, and definitely not something I would do without being specifically told so (probably several times).  Similarly, \"Uncle\" would feel weird to me for the father of the guy I was dating. It would feel icky.", "NTA\n\nPeople don't get to just call you whatever they want. They need to respect your boundaries.", "NAH. You are absolutely correct.  I feel for the girl and was almost tempted to say that since she seems to trust you, perhaps you could be a sounding board for her.  But in light of her obvious search for a father figure I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea for you to become more involved than you currently are.  I hope she finds the help she needs.", "NAH.  You did it correctly and were not harsh or judgmental about it.  Also, think of it as confirmation that you and your wife are doing things correctly.  She sees what you are doing with her boyfriend and wishes and shown you what situation she would like to be in.  Boundaries are good and you set a reasonable one.  Maybe the next time she is over that you can set some time to talk with her further and talk about  your reasonings in your post.  Continue to make your home a safe place, not just for the current girlfriend by for any of your son's friends which will help your son grow.", "NTA. You handled that incredibly well.

We\u2019ve worked our asses off to be the house that everyone comes to. We\u2019re called mom and dad by no less than 15 kids. \n\nThe area we\u2019re in is in a heavy opioid epidemic and extremely poor. We\u2019re the only stability most of these kids have. They need to have *someone* to see as a mom and dad. If it\u2019s us, we\u2019re ok with it. We were both raised in abusive houses, though, and know what it\u2019s like to be isolated and have no one. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re not a Ms child focused as us. Maybe you don\u2019t see things the way we do. Maybe you\u2019re just not comfortable with it. All of those things are OK. \n\nSome of those kids that call us mom and dad are in college now and still keep in touch with us. Some of them only show up when shit is really bad or they\u2019re in trouble or they\u2019re drunk or whatever. Some of them stop coming around. We\u2019re here for whatever they need. \n\nNAH.

Theyre so young and its all so uncertain for them right now, even if things are going well. Thank you for the reassurance", "yeah, dont get me wrong im glad people feel safe in my home, thats the goal lol. Its just insanely soon, especially given how young they both are and how uncertain anything in their love life is at this age, from what i see now i really have no problem with her becoming part of the family someday", "me and my wife both came from some less than awesome backgrounds, so we're really trying to make that end with us and our parenting. my wife is the one who really makes it a home, im not an incredibly affectionate person so she balances everything out", "beyond understandable lol. I forget not everyone uses \"uncle\" as a term for any  man thats older than you. Its not always about being related in some cultures, but i forget that", "i do want to be someone kids can come to, thats how we started filing for custody of our son, it was just a little early for that, and given that her parents are still in the picture but non-custodial, i worry about conflict between adults. Don't think for a second that i don't care about her, though, folks call me an uncle for a reason, i tend to collect and protect people regarldess of their ages.

I work in CPS. This is typical behavior in kids that have had trauma. In younger kids it's seen as \"soooo sweet\" when they tell strangers they love them and hug everyone: that's not safe and not normal and it's because their development has been interrupted by traumatic experiences. This girl needs firm boundaries to feel safe and to understand why it's weird to call you dad.  This will help her in the future. Please have a follow-up conversation about how you love her, and all the ways you care about her and will take care of her. Let her pick a different affectionate nickname for you that's special just for her. Good luck!", "I\u2019m sure she understands she isn\u2019t really welcome and won\u2019t be by anymore", "we never said we were lol, what?", "that is absolutely NOT the case, and if you continue being hateful towards a literal child i will be blocking you and reporting you to the admins in this group"]}
