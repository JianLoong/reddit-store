I was married out of province at a location 4-7 hours travel for my family. It was also a bilingual wedding, he is french/ I am english. I invited 40 people and 30 came, but my husband\u2019s side was much bigger at 150, so basically it was a 200 person wedding. \n\nThe ceremony was beautiful, it was everything i dreamed of. The reception is where it went awry, as 2 of my 5 bridesmaids became belligerently drunk to the point they were removed from the building. The other three bridesmaids did not get up from their table one time, they sat for 3 hours and did not talk to anyone but themselves. We didn\u2019t have an emcee and our food situation was very hectic so we were trying to keep people entertained while they waited for their food- my mom looked bored as she sat playing a game on her phone at the head table, totally oblivious that other people were waiting 3 hours for their food. My dad was being social, but he always follows mom. \n\nWe were late cutting the cake at 9:30pm and our dance commenced by 10:15pm or so, but by then my parents, sisters and other bridesmaid had said their good nights to me and left. They didnt stay for more than 1 song at our dance, and what hurt the worst is I didn\u2019t get my daddy daughter dance I had been looking forward to my whole life. My entire side that I invited was gone by 10:30pm on my wedding night. \n\nThe next morning I arrived at the house everyone was staying at, and nobody was there. It was 8am and everyone had left at the same time to catch the ferry back to their home province. My phone was dead, so when it recharged I got several texts from my friends and family saying how lovely a time they had. \n\nThis is when I became incredibly upset because they could have waited 15 minutes for me to come say goodbye and have a minute with my family. They weren\u2019t going to miss the ferry, they would be there with 2 hours to wait and 2 more ferries in the day. We were hosting brunch- they didn\u2019t even have to stay for that, just at least say goodbye to my face, I feel I deserved that. \n\nI also understand that people are tired, but I had a 10 month old at the time that nobody even offered to help me out with, I had no sleep but I still turned up because it\u2019s expected of me. My husband even paid the whole thing because he saved his whole life for a wedding. \n\nLastly, since I refused to speak to anyone, I have been told I am immature, I\u2019m mad for no reason, I am tearing the family up. Apparently my sister is telling my 5 year old niece that \u201cAunty will get over it and remember us\u201d. This same sister keeps trying to text me like nothing has happened. \n\nSo, am I an arse for not speaking to my family/friends based on their actions at my wedding?", "created_utc": 1702513265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hvly8/aitah_for_refusing_to_speak_to_my_family_wedding/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's recap:\n\n- Your family has travelled a good many hours to get to your wedding\n- Two of your bridesmaids got overly drunk because you had no food there for them and they hadn't eaten all day. Not a good look for them but partly your fault\n- You expected your other bridesmaids to... mingle with the guests and entertain them. Did they know these people? Did they know French? Did they know you expected this of them?\n- You has no one keeping track of time and managing guests\n- You're complaining because your mother was bored, tired, and hungry because you had no food\n- They managed to stay for the cake cutting and a dance but were exhausted and wanted to go to bed, but that's not good enough for you. Seriously 9:30???\n- They left early the next day because they had a long trip home and wanted to make sure they didn't miss the ferry. Did you even tell them about the brunch in advance or was that also last minute notice?\n- Who cares that you have a 10 month old and still showed up? Of course you showed up it's your wedding! Then the audacity to complain no one helped you with her! Should have hired a baby sitter and not expect wedding guests from afar to pitch in.\n- Now you're stroppy and throwing a tantrum because your own terrible planning\n\nThis whole wedding drama is pretty much all your fault.", "YTA. Sounds like it was a very poorly run wedding. \n\nPeople were probably hungry and irritated and tired.  Can\u2019t really blame them. \n\nYou should have just let it go. But you went and made a big thing of it. And now you\u2019re stuck. \n\n(No excuse for the two drunk slobs, though. How embarrassing!)", "YTA. That sounds like a terrible wedding to be a guest at. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you aren\u2019t apologising & trying to make it up to them!\n\nI cannot see that they did anything wrong. If I went to a wedding that was so badly run  that the food was THREE HOURS LATE, I would have probably left after the first 1.5-2 hours to go & buy myself some food somewhere else - unless it was in the middle of nowhere & too hard to leave for an hour. \n\nI think they went above & beyond staying as long as they did. \n\nWhy was your wedding so badly organised - and why don\u2019t you feel more guilty about how badly your guests are treated?\n\nETA: also, did you do anything to introduce your side of the family (Including bridesmaids) to the other guests before the wedding day?  Things like hen nights or even the night before the wedding (if the guests aren\u2019t all local) for an informal get together, so that on the day people aren\u2019t all strangers. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t do that, then it\u2019s not really on your bridesmaids or your mum to go around introducing themselves to random strangers. A good hostess takes charge of that - and they certainly don\u2019t criticise their guests for not doing their job for them!", "YTA 100%. Your family is correct that you\u2019re being immature and overly dramatic. This is a truly silly reason to go no contact with your family. What are you even mad about? They came to your wedding but didn\u2019t dance enough? Left early because they were hungry and tired? Sent you a text thanking you instead of speaking to you in person on the day after your wedding\u2014when it would be reasonable to assume you were busy?\n\nStop being such a drama queen.", "YTA. I'm sorry, but this sounds like a wedding from hell. First, it was a destination wedding, so obviously a lot of people are not going to make it. Second, it was a poorly organized mess and I don't see how it was on your guests to fix it. Third, these were your guests, not your babysitters. Organising childcare was your job. Fourth, this is your wedding, of course you were expected to show up. I actually laughed out loud when I got to that part of your post. Your guests? Not so much. Fifth, your guests were hungry for hours and exhausted by the time you got your big moments underway. These people had to travel early tomorrow, it was late, of course they wanted to sleep. Sixth, it was you who didn't charge your phone and never bothered to contact your family to make arrangements to see them before they left. I can't believe the ferry time was not planned way in advance. They tried to get through to you to say goodbye, but your phone was off. I  could go on, but this covers the biggest points. The only assholes were the two drunk bridesmaids. The rest is all on you. Fix your attitude before you irreparably damage your relationship with the people who love you.", "Your wedding wasn't well planned. \n\nShit happens. \n\nYou didn't even start dancing until after 10. That's not anyone's fault but unless you communicated with your parents, how late did you expect them to stay/wait? \n\nWhat was wrong with your parents behavior? Did you expect them to fix the situation? \n\nEven your bridesmaids, ok the 2 that got kicked out are jerks but you Saud you only had 40 people invited, and there was a bi-lingual situation. How many people did they know? \n\nHonestly it sounds like it was your husband's party and your family was the afterthought, and they acted like it. \n\nNot everyone expects the brunch the next day, usually in my area that's the first day of the honeymoon. So why would they stay and wait to say goodbye, that happened already the night before. \n\nI get it, things didn't play out the way you wanted. But it's not their fault either.", "YTA. What was your Mom supposed to do about the food? Pop into the kitchen and cook it faster? Who planned this disaster of a wedding? No one wants to spend all day sitting around with no food until 9 pm. By 9 pm, I want to be at home in my jammies. Alcohol with no food was also a mistake, but at least the drunk bridesmaids provided free entertainment. \n\nIf you hired a wedding planner and caterer, sue them and apologize to your family for that dumpster fire of a reception and the fit you threw afterwards.", "Were your bridesmaids extremely drunk because there was only alcohol and no food for 3 hours? And did his family mostly speak French?", "YTA\n\nHonestly it sounds like they were a bit rude, and I'd be rightfully pissed at your bridesmaids, but 99% of this family situation is the result of your poor planning. You were the ones who screwed up the food, screwed up the emcee, screwed up the timing, screwed up your phone communication, etc. It's all on you, you can't blame the guests for not fixing things on your behalf. And they certainly aren't obligated to watch your kid.", "Yta your wedding sounds unorganized and a real downer. Glad you had a great time but for your guests I'm sure they were bored. I left a wedding and went to McDonald's when they didn't even offer food or apps until after 11pm when the wedding started at 2.", "You didn't mention communicating these desires ahead of time. They seem reasonable to you from your perspective! How well does your family do at reading your mind? Is this something you're used to? \n\nIf you don't communicate, you really can't get overly upset at them failing to do what wasn't an expectation. \n\nAnd it sounds like your reception went way too long. The bad guy they isn't your dad ... again, unless you communicated to him about continuing to stay. (The belligerent drunk thing is a legit frustration, but might not be worth going NC.)\n\nYTA", "YTA. Expecting people to read your mind and volunteer for childcare is not cool \u2014 you need to arrange that beforehand. If the daddy-daughter dance was something you\u2019d been looking forward to your entire life \u2026 did you tell your dad that? It sounds like you had a lot of expectations and not enough communication. I agree with what others said \u2014 sounds like people were hungry and tired.", "YTA - every single issue with your family and your wedding was entirely your fault and within your realm of control.", "YTA. And I would *love* to hear your family's version of what happened", "Yes, YTA here.  You sound extremely entitled and immature...", "I'm sorry, but YTA. You had a 200 person wedding with no wedding planner or MC, and it really showed. Because it was poorly organized, many miscommunications happened. Yes, getting that drunk is a jerk move, but that was only two people. The rest of them weren't doing anything wrong. It sounds like you did not have or clearly communicate a schedule of events to everyone.", "YTA\n\nYour wedding was a Shit show. That's on you. \n\nLack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency for anyone else. \n\nI'd have bounced out way earlier. 3 HOURS for food? \n\nDa fuck?", "Old people rarely stay up past 9pm, and even then it\u2019s for special occasions. First dance after 10pm? What time did the wedding actually start? You both planned poorly, both you and your husband, for every single guest there. No music and seemingly zero entertainment. You noticed your family leaving early as they were the most important to you, but I can be quite sure other, less important people left before/during/afterwards. \n\nYou are refusing to speak to your family over what seems to be a miscommunication in expectations. Did your dad know you wanted to dance with him? Was there a plan and song picked out? Did they know there wouldn\u2019t be anything to do but stare at each other while you and your husband did whatever you did? They\u2019ve likely been to plenty of weddings before yours, and likely had ways to entertain themselves while the newlyweds did newlywed stuff. You didn\u2019t plan for any of that, won\u2019t talk to explain why you\u2019re upset, and are wondering if you\u2019re the AH. Congrats on the marriage, but YTA for how you\u2019re choosing to handle this.", "YTA- no one wants to wait that long for food. This was very, very poorly planned. I get that you\u2019re upset but this is a stupid reason to go NC with your family", "Your wedding sounds like it was poorly planned and executed. You not having an MC is poor planning. The caterers not giving food and people waiting for 3 hours is poor planning on their part, I'd ask for a refund. Cutting the cake and the first dance starting late is poor planning. These are not the guests' fault.\nBridesmaids shouldn't have got that drunk, but I guess they didn't have food before drinking due to the catering issue.\n\n> The other three bridesmaids did not get up from their table one time, they sat for 3 hours and did not talk to anyone but themselves.\n\nOnly 40 people on your side came. They may not have known anyone else beside the other bridesmaids. You also said it was a bilingual wedding, so there was most likely a language barrier if they were to talk to your husbands side. What did you want the bridesmaid to do. Be the entertainment? It seems they enjoyed themselves having a chat to one another. You can't control how other people enjoy themselves.\n\n>my mom looked bored as she sat playing a game on her phone at the head table, totally oblivious that other people were waiting 3 hours for their food.\n\nI mean it was rude to be on your phone during a wedding reception, but what was she supposed to do. No food for 3 hours, people trying to keep the crowd entertained but have no idea what's happening with the food, I don't blame her for being bored. Also what did you want your mum to do about the caterers? \n\nI'm not sure why you guys just didn't cut the cake, have your first dance, father daughter dance and get the dance floor going whilst waiting for the caterers? Seems like the most logical option to me.\n\n>We were late cutting the cake at 9:30pm and our dance commenced by 10:15pm \n\nThat is extremely late. I understand guest leaving, no food or entertainment for three hours. How boring.\n\n>My phone was dead,\n\nAgain, poor planning, that's on you. If you had the phone charged, you could have asked them what ferry they are catching. What did you expect? people to just wait around for you to hopefully stop by, when you weren't even answering your phone? Your wedding is over, post wedding activities are not compulsory and people can go home and leave whenever they want.\n\n>I had a 10 month old at the time that nobody even offered to help me out with\n\nIt's your child, you should ask for help or get a sitter. Would have it been nice for someone to offer, sure but no one is obligated too. Also, people want to enjoy a wedding and may not want to look after an infant.\n\nHonestly, if anything, the poor wedding planning was on you and your husband. Most of this whole situation is on you guys. You should be angry at yourselves more than anyone, but it's easier to blame people around you than accept accountability. Only AH behaviour and this is mild, is your bridesmaids and immediate family leaving at a reasonable time but missing the dances. No matter how late it is, family and bridal parties stay til end or are close to it. However, given that everything was so poorly organised and 3 hours was spent doing nothing, I wouldn't blame them for being tired and over it.\n\nI think your family weren't really involved in planning this wedding as they seemed like they weren't really part of it. Seems like this was your husband's wedding and your family where just an afterthought.\n\nYTA and so is your husband. Take accountability for your poor planning. Stop trying to shift blame to your family.", "YTA.", "YTA  - There\u2019s a lot of people here. Obviously getting belligerent a wedding is no good. It also sounds like your wedding wasnt planned well if everyone was bored and you didnt know who was or wasnt attending a brunch. \n\nCan I see you being annoyed at some people, sure. But I dont think this is as bad overall as youre making it seem and I think you could have maybe done better at wedding planning likely\n\nEdit - changing to YTA. The drunk people really arent the issue.", "Didn't  the venue give you a schedule what was supposed to happen? I don't know if it's a hotel wedding but usually they do give you a schedule. That's the first problem this wedding was poorly organised. People were hungry, maybe that's why your 2 bridesmaids were drinking, and your mum playing games on her phone.\n\nBecause of the delay I think everyone was tired if it has been going on all day. Your dad must have been tired after or might not have remembered. Did You remind him of the dance? \n\nI can understand people left but purely excuses because I believe they didn't really have good time, ans didn't want to seem upset.\n\nDon't lose family/friends over this. If you had a schedule, speak to the venue and see if you can get partial Refund, and use that money to take people out for food (family then close friends) thank them for coming to the wedding, apologise for the delay of food and schedule, also for your behaviour after the wedding. You invited these people because they mean a lot to you. Don't lose them over this.\n\nIn regards to your baby, you should have hired a baby sitter as most guest won't want to be one whilst attending the wedding, plus most likely consume alcohol and not fit to look after a child.\n\nYour sister is trying to make out like nothing happened because she knew obviously something has happened but it had been a fee months and doesn't want to lose contact with you, especially if your niece has b3en asking for you. She can't tell her auntie doesn't want to see her?\n\nI truly hope you put things aside and make up with your family.", "YTA. Sounds like your wedding was poorly planned and you were disappointed with the outcome. Its ok to be upset about your family just leaving early but to refuse to speak to them for months? That\u2019s just a disproportionate response to the situation.\n\nYour family members don\u2019t seem to be all that worried about you going incommunicado. Is that because you\u2019ve done this before?", "YTA. You were tired, had to take care of your own child but still turned up because it was expected? If you mean showing up to your own wedding, then yes. It was expected. If you\u2019re talking about showing up the day after your wedding, then clearly it wasn\u2019t expected. Sounds like no one knew about that. Sounds like you had a lot of expectations but failed to make firm plans and arrangements.", ">I had no sleep but I still turned up because it\u2019s expected of me.\n\nYou mean... To your own wedding?\n\nIf I had been sitting at a table waiting for 3 hours waiting for some food I'd be cranky too and excited to go home. Especially after a 4-7h journey and another one ahead.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou had a wedding  party that took THREE HOURS to feed 200 people.\n\nWTF?\n\nI'm surprised anyone was there for any dance. \n\nDid you talk to any of your whopping 30 guests at all during your reception?", "It sounds like a poor planned wedding. Where was the day of coordinator? Why didn't you have the father daughter dance at the beginning of the reception if it was so important to you? Why are guests waiting 3 hours to eat? I would've left much sooner. That fact your family and friends even stay that long is amazing to me. I would've disowned you for such a badly planned reception. Of course bridesmaids got drunk. There was no food! YTA. \n\nWho the hell would stay for brunch? 7 hour journey for such a shifty wedding", "Your wedding reception was poorly planned and poorly executed. People didn't have a great time and were ready to go. Doesn't mean they don't love you, just means you threw a bad party. Them all leaving without saying goodbye the next day sucked, but if you had a dead phone, did they know you were coming over to say goodbye? Were they in a rush to go eat breakfast?\n\nIf you planned for 2 years, how did it go this sideways? I say let it go. There was so much you could control but didn't. Someone else being tired or drunk and hungry is something you might want to not internalize.\n\nYTA. If you want your guests to stay late, give them something good to stay for. Eventually, people needed some sleep. And probably a trip to Burger King.", "Tragic story.\nHow the hell were you at their accommodation for 8am the morning after your wedding night though. I would have been having a lie in until brunch!", "Info: did you ever talk to your family about how you feel? Or did you just refuse to speak to them after you woke up and they had already left? \n\nI understand some of your hurt, but it truly feels like there has been 0 communication about expectations or feelings and instead you\u2019re just giving them the silent treatment to punish them for how you feel without actually trying to resolve anything. If that\u2019s an incorrect account of what happened I\u2019d love to know, but from what you\u2019ve written here you\u2019re behaving quite immaturely.", "I think a lot of information is missing from the bridesmaid and from her family POV.", "YTA. It seems like your family lives far enough away that they probably weren\u2019t involved with the planning, may not have spoken the language many there did and based on the poor planning issues have to ask if you told them what time you would be by in the morning to say goodbye and were you just late or dropping in unannounced? \n\nYou sound very entitled and wrongly upset after they traveled so far to be with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And if they had a full day's travel they likely couldn't have had brunch as they needed to time ferrys. \n\nCarrying a grudge for your own mistakes and poor planning, then tossing in the 'I have a baby and no one helped, but *I* showed up!' is just. Ugh. It's your kid, so you arrange childcare. It's your wedding. You don't get kudos for showing up.", "Even more reasonable to assume she's busy when they can't reach her via phone! I wouldn't wait around to see if brunch was happening if the bride were unresponsive and I had a 7 hour trip home - especially given how poorly the wedding was run. I'd assume brunch was cancelled and start heading out", "I\u2019m not even so certain about those two bridesmaids. If I drank assuming I\u2019d have dinner to sop it up,  and then wasn\u2019t fed? I might have gotten too drunk myself\u2026", "Tbh the bride had no food available just booze so with nothing to soak up the booze for 3 hours until the food was finally ready. I don't blame them for being \"drunk\"", "And then to not even have her phone charged so her family could talk to her before they left? Like, how is that their fault?", "With as poor as the planning on the wedding reception sounds to have been, I wonder if OP told her family about the brunch in advance? Or did she just expect them to know there'd be one and to stay for it?\n\nThough even if they knew, with the poor organization of the reception itself, it's understandable that they might not want to stay for a brunch. Not with half a day to a day's drive ahead of them. I know I'd be concerned that the brunch would run just as late.", "Exactly this so OP YTA", "The dad not staying for the dance though, that\u2019s a bit fucked up.", "Yeah, don't serve hungry people booze only, and then be surprised when they're drunk.", "Also notice how it's only OP's mom that's supposed to do *something* to fix it but MIL is excused from having to also do *something* to fix it because reasons?\n\nOP's just mad she couldn't impress her new in-laws and mad her family didn't help her while ignoring the fact her new husband and his family who has more people in his family also did fuck all.", "This ^ OP says it all.  How would your guests know that if they'd waited 15 minutes that they would have been there for you to say goodbye. You didn't tell them. I should imagine they weren't expecting to see you as that would've been the first day of your honeymoon. They all had long journeys back home so not surprising that they would want to make a start back in the morning. You sound like a petulant child instead of a grown woman.", "This comment is completely uncalled for.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

A 7 hour drive with a ferry is exhausting. Depending on age and health and if they work the next day.... yeah getting an early start makes sense. \n\nThe order of events is really weird to me as well. But that might be a cultural thing? \n\nWhere I'm from you have a ceremony, guests have a cocktail hour, then the bride and groom \"arrive\" and are introduced and then the special dances. Then dinner and then party. \n\nThis sounds more like a party than a wedding to me.", "But did he know his daughter's expectations?", "That order sounds so weird to me! lol I am used to the speeches followed by dinner then the special dances then everyone dances. Like the special dances start the dance part of the evening."]}
