I was married out of province at a location 4-7 hours travel for my family. It was also a bilingual wedding, he is french/ I am english. I invited 40 people and 30 came, but my husband\u2019s side was much bigger at 150, so basically it was a 200 person wedding. \n\nThe ceremony was beautiful, it was everything i dreamed of. The reception is where it went awry, as 2 of my 5 bridesmaids became belligerently drunk to the point they were removed from the building. The other three bridesmaids did not get up from their table one time, they sat for 3 hours and did not talk to anyone but themselves. We didn\u2019t have an emcee and our food situation was very hectic so we were trying to keep people entertained while they waited for their food- my mom looked bored as she sat playing a game on her phone at the head table, totally oblivious that other people were waiting 3 hours for their food. My dad was being social, but he always follows mom. \n\nWe were late cutting the cake at 9:30pm and our dance commenced by 10:15pm or so, but by then my parents, sisters and other bridesmaid had said their good nights to me and left. They didnt stay for more than 1 song at our dance, and what hurt the worst is I didn\u2019t get my daddy daughter dance I had been looking forward to my whole life. My entire side that I invited was gone by 10:30pm on my wedding night. \n\nThe next morning I arrived at the house everyone was staying at, and nobody was there. It was 8am and everyone had left at the same time to catch the ferry back to their home province. My phone was dead, so when it recharged I got several texts from my friends and family saying how lovely a time they had. \n\nThis is when I became incredibly upset because they could have waited 15 minutes for me to come say goodbye and have a minute with my family. They weren\u2019t going to miss the ferry, they would be there with 2 hours to wait and 2 more ferries in the day. We were hosting brunch- they didn\u2019t even have to stay for that, just at least say goodbye to my face, I feel I deserved that. \n\nI also understand that people are tired, but I had a 10 month old at the time that nobody even offered to help me out with, I had no sleep but I still turned up because it\u2019s expected of me. My husband even paid the whole thing because he saved his whole life for a wedding. \n\nLastly, since I refused to speak to anyone, I have been told I am immature, I\u2019m mad for no reason, I am tearing the family up. Apparently my sister is telling my 5 year old niece that \u201cAunty will get over it and remember us\u201d. This same sister keeps trying to text me like nothing has happened. \n\nSo, am I an arse for not speaking to my family/friends based on their actions at my wedding?", "created_utc": 1702513265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hvly8/aitah_for_refusing_to_speak_to_my_family_wedding/", "score": 686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's recap:\n\n- Your family has travelled a good many hours to get to your wedding\n- Two of your bridesmaids got overly drunk because you had no food there for them and they hadn't eaten all day. Not a good look for them but partly your fault\n- You expected your other bridesmaids to... mingle with the guests and entertain them. Did they know these people? Did they know French? Did they know you expected this of them?\n- You has no one keeping track of time and managing guests\n- You're complaining because your mother was bored, tired, and hungry because you had no food\n- They managed to stay for the cake cutting and a dance but were exhausted and wanted to go to bed, but that's not good enough for you. Seriously 9:30???\n- They left early the next day because they had a long trip home and wanted to make sure they didn't miss the ferry. Did you even tell them about the brunch in advance or was that also last minute notice?\n- Who cares that you have a 10 month old and still showed up? Of course you showed up it's your wedding! Then the audacity to complain no one helped you with her! Should have hired a baby sitter and not expect wedding guests from afar to pitch in.\n- Now you're stroppy and throwing a tantrum because your own terrible planning\n\nThis whole wedding drama is pretty much all your fault.", "YTA. Sounds like it was a very poorly run wedding. \n\nPeople were probably hungry and irritated and tired.  Can\u2019t really blame them. \n\nYou should have just let it go. But you went and made a big thing of it. And now you\u2019re stuck. \n\n(No excuse for the two drunk slobs, though. How embarrassing!)", "YTA. That sounds like a terrible wedding to be a guest at. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you aren\u2019t apologising & trying to make it up to them!\n\nI cannot see that they did anything wrong. If I went to a wedding that was so badly run  that the food was THREE HOURS LATE, I would have probably left after the first 1.5-2 hours to go & buy myself some food somewhere else - unless it was in the middle of nowhere & too hard to leave for an hour. \n\nI think they went above & beyond staying as long as they did. \n\nWhy was your wedding so badly organised - and why don\u2019t you feel more guilty about how badly your guests are treated?\n\nETA: also, did you do anything to introduce your side of the family (Including bridesmaids) to the other guests before the wedding day?  Things like hen nights or even the night before the wedding (if the guests aren\u2019t all local) for an informal get together, so that on the day people aren\u2019t all strangers. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t do that, then it\u2019s not really on your bridesmaids or your mum to go around introducing themselves to random strangers. A good hostess takes charge of that - and they certainly don\u2019t criticise their guests for not doing their job for them!", "YTA 100%. Your family is correct that you\u2019re being immature and overly dramatic. This is a truly silly reason to go no contact with your family. What are you even mad about? They came to your wedding but didn\u2019t dance enough? Left early because they were hungry and tired? Sent you a text thanking you instead of speaking to you in person on the day after your wedding\u2014when it would be reasonable to assume you were busy?\n\nStop being such a drama queen.", "YTA. I'm sorry, but this sounds like a wedding from hell. First, it was a destination wedding, so obviously a lot of people are not going to make it. Second, it was a poorly organized mess and I don't see how it was on your guests to fix it. Third, these were your guests, not your babysitters. Organising childcare was your job. Fourth, this is your wedding, of course you were expected to show up. I actually laughed out loud when I got to that part of your post. Your guests? Not so much. Fifth, your guests were hungry for hours and exhausted by the time you got your big moments underway. These people had to travel early tomorrow, it was late, of course they wanted to sleep. Sixth, it was you who didn't charge your phone and never bothered to contact your family to make arrangements to see them before they left. I can't believe the ferry time was not planned way in advance. They tried to get through to you to say goodbye, but your phone was off. I  could go on, but this covers the biggest points. The only assholes were the two drunk bridesmaids. The rest is all on you. Fix your attitude before you irreparably damage your relationship with the people who love you.", "Your wedding wasn't well planned. \n\nShit happens. \n\nYou didn't even start dancing until after 10. That's not anyone's fault but unless you communicated with your parents, how late did you expect them to stay/wait? \n\nWhat was wrong with your parents behavior? Did you expect them to fix the situation? \n\nEven your bridesmaids, ok the 2 that got kicked out are jerks but you Saud you only had 40 people invited, and there was a bi-lingual situation. How many people did they know? \n\nHonestly it sounds like it was your husband's party and your family was the afterthought, and they acted like it. \n\nNot everyone expects the brunch the next day, usually in my area that's the first day of the honeymoon. So why would they stay and wait to say goodbye, that happened already the night before. \n\nI get it, things didn't play out the way you wanted. But it's not their fault either.", "YTA. What was your Mom supposed to do about the food? Pop into the kitchen and cook it faster? Who planned this disaster of a wedding? No one wants to spend all day sitting around with no food until 9 pm. By 9 pm, I want to be at home in my jammies. Alcohol with no food was also a mistake, but at least the drunk bridesmaids provided free entertainment. \n\nIf you hired a wedding planner and caterer, sue them and apologize to your family for that dumpster fire of a reception and the fit you threw afterwards.", "Were your bridesmaids extremely drunk because there was only alcohol and no food for 3 hours? And did his family mostly speak French?", "YTA\n\nHonestly it sounds like they were a bit rude, and I'd be rightfully pissed at your bridesmaids, but 99% of this family situation is the result of your poor planning. You were the ones who screwed up the food, screwed up the emcee, screwed up the timing, screwed up your phone communication, etc. It's all on you, you can't blame the guests for not fixing things on your behalf. And they certainly aren't obligated to watch your kid.", "Yta your wedding sounds unorganized and a real downer. Glad you had a great time but for your guests I'm sure they were bored. I left a wedding and went to McDonald's when they didn't even offer food or apps until after 11pm when the wedding started at 2.", "You didn't mention communicating these desires ahead of time. They seem reasonable to you from your perspective! How well does your family do at reading your mind? Is this something you're used to? \n\nIf you don't communicate, you really can't get overly upset at them failing to do what wasn't an expectation. \n\nAnd it sounds like your reception went way too long. The bad guy they isn't your dad ... again, unless you communicated to him about continuing to stay. (The belligerent drunk thing is a legit frustration, but might not be worth going NC.)\n\nYTA", "YTA. Expecting people to read your mind and volunteer for childcare is not cool \u2014 you need to arrange that beforehand. If the daddy-daughter dance was something you\u2019d been looking forward to your entire life \u2026 did you tell your dad that? It sounds like you had a lot of expectations and not enough communication. I agree with what others said \u2014 sounds like people were hungry and tired.", "YTA - every single issue with your family and your wedding was entirely your fault and within your realm of control.", "YTA. And I would *love* to hear your family's version of what happened", "Yes, YTA here.  You sound extremely entitled and immature...", "I'm sorry, but YTA. You had a 200 person wedding with no wedding planner or MC, and it really showed. Because it was poorly organized, many miscommunications happened. Yes, getting that drunk is a jerk move, but that was only two people. The rest of them weren't doing anything wrong. It sounds like you did not have or clearly communicate a schedule of events to everyone.", "YTA\n\nYour wedding was a Shit show. That's on you. \n\nLack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency for anyone else. \n\nI'd have bounced out way earlier. 3 HOURS for food? \n\nDa fuck?", "Old people rarely stay up past 9pm, and even then it\u2019s for special occasions. First dance after 10pm? What time did the wedding actually start? You both planned poorly, both you and your husband, for every single guest there. No music and seemingly zero entertainment. You noticed your family leaving early as they were the most important to you, but I can be quite sure other, less important people left before/during/afterwards. \n\nYou are refusing to speak to your family over what seems to be a miscommunication in expectations. Did your dad know you wanted to dance with him? Was there a plan and song picked out? Did they know there wouldn\u2019t be anything to do but stare at each other while you and your husband did whatever you did? They\u2019ve likely been to plenty of weddings before yours, and likely had ways to entertain themselves while the newlyweds did newlywed stuff. You didn\u2019t plan for any of that, won\u2019t talk to explain why you\u2019re upset, and are wondering if you\u2019re the AH. Congrats on the marriage, but YTA for how you\u2019re choosing to handle this.", "YTA- no one wants to wait that long for food. This was very, very poorly planned. I get that you\u2019re upset but this is a stupid reason to go NC with your family", "Your wedding sounds like it was poorly planned and executed. You not having an MC is poor planning. The caterers not giving food and people waiting for 3 hours is poor planning on their part, I'd ask for a refund. Cutting the cake and the first dance starting late is poor planning. These are not the guests' fault.\nBridesmaids shouldn't have got that drunk, but I guess they didn't have food before drinking due to the catering issue.\n\n> The other three bridesmaids did not get up from their table one time, they sat for 3 hours and did not talk to anyone but themselves.\n\nOnly 40 people on your side came. They may not have known anyone else beside the other bridesmaids. You also said it was a bilingual wedding, so there was most likely a language barrier if they were to talk to your husbands side. What did you want the bridesmaid to do. Be the entertainment? It seems they enjoyed themselves having a chat to one another. You can't control how other people enjoy themselves.\n\n>my mom looked bored as she sat playing a game on her phone at the head table, totally oblivious that other people were waiting 3 hours for their food.\n\nI mean it was rude to be on your phone during a wedding reception, but what was she supposed to do. No food for 3 hours, people trying to keep the crowd entertained but have no idea what's happening with the food, I don't blame her for being bored. Also what did you want your mum to do about the caterers? \n\nI'm not sure why you guys just didn't cut the cake, have your first dance, father daughter dance and get the dance floor going whilst waiting for the caterers? Seems like the most logical option to me.\n\n>We were late cutting the cake at 9:30pm and our dance commenced by 10:15pm \n\nThat is extremely late. I understand guest leaving, no food or entertainment for three hours. How boring.\n\n>My phone was dead,\n\nAgain, poor planning, that's on you. If you had the phone charged, you could have asked them what ferry they are catching. What did you expect? people to just wait around for you to hopefully stop by, when you weren't even answering your phone? Your wedding is over, post wedding activities are not compulsory and people can go home and leave whenever they want.\n\n>I had a 10 month old at the time that nobody even offered to help me out with\n\nIt's your child, you should ask for help or get a sitter. Would have it been nice for someone to offer, sure but no one is obligated too. Also, people want to enjoy a wedding and may not want to look after an infant.\n\nHonestly, if anything, the poor wedding planning was on you and your husband. Most of this whole situation is on you guys. You should be angry at yourselves more than anyone, but it's easier to blame people around you than accept accountability. Only AH behaviour and this is mild, is your bridesmaids and immediate family leaving at a reasonable time but missing the dances. No matter how late it is, family and bridal parties stay til end or are close to it. However, given that everything was so poorly organised and 3 hours was spent doing nothing, I wouldn't blame them for being tired and over it.\n\nI think your family weren't really involved in planning this wedding as they seemed like they weren't really part of it. Seems like this was your husband's wedding and your family where just an afterthought.\n\nYTA and so is your husband. Take accountability for your poor planning. Stop trying to shift blame to your family.", "YTA.", "YTA  - There\u2019s a lot of people here. Obviously getting belligerent a wedding is no good. It also sounds like your wedding wasnt planned well if everyone was bored and you didnt know who was or wasnt attending a brunch. \n\nCan I see you being annoyed at some people, sure. But I dont think this is as bad overall as youre making it seem and I think you could have maybe done better at wedding planning likely\n\nEdit - changing to YTA. The drunk people really arent the issue.", "Didn't  the venue give you a schedule what was supposed to happen? I don't know if it's a hotel wedding but usually they do give you a schedule. That's the first problem this wedding was poorly organised. People were hungry, maybe that's why your 2 bridesmaids were drinking, and your mum playing games on her phone.\n\nBecause of the delay I think everyone was tired if it has been going on all day. Your dad must have been tired after or might not have remembered. Did You remind him of the dance? \n\nI can understand people left but purely excuses because I believe they didn't really have good time, ans didn't want to seem upset.\n\nDon't lose family/friends over this. If you had a schedule, speak to the venue and see if you can get partial Refund, and use that money to take people out for food (family then close friends) thank them for coming to the wedding, apologise for the delay of food and schedule, also for your behaviour after the wedding. You invited these people because they mean a lot to you. Don't lose them over this.\n\nIn regards to your baby, you should have hired a baby sitter as most guest won't want to be one whilst attending the wedding, plus most likely consume alcohol and not fit to look after a child.\n\nYour sister is trying to make out like nothing happened because she knew obviously something has happened but it had been a fee months and doesn't want to lose contact with you, especially if your niece has b3en asking for you. She can't tell her auntie doesn't want to see her?\n\nI truly hope you put things aside and make up with your family.", "YTA. Sounds like your wedding was poorly planned and you were disappointed with the outcome. Its ok to be upset about your family just leaving early but to refuse to speak to them for months? That\u2019s just a disproportionate response to the situation.\n\nYour family members don\u2019t seem to be all that worried about you going incommunicado. Is that because you\u2019ve done this before?", "YTA. You were tired, had to take care of your own child but still turned up because it was expected? If you mean showing up to your own wedding, then yes. It was expected. If you\u2019re talking about showing up the day after your wedding, then clearly it wasn\u2019t expected. Sounds like no one knew about that. Sounds like you had a lot of expectations but failed to make firm plans and arrangements.", ">I had no sleep but I still turned up because it\u2019s expected of me.\n\nYou mean... You showed up to your own wedding?\n\nIf I had been sitting at a table for 3 hours waiting for some food I'd be cranky and excited to go home too. Especially after a 4-7h journey and another one ahead.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou had a wedding  party that took THREE HOURS to feed 200 people.\n\nWTF?\n\nI'm surprised anyone was there for any dance. \n\nDid you talk to any of your whopping 30 guests at all during your reception?", "It sounds like a poor planned wedding. Where was the day of coordinator? Why didn't you have the father daughter dance at the beginning of the reception if it was so important to you? Why are guests waiting 3 hours to eat? I would've left much sooner. That fact your family and friends even stay that long is amazing to me. I would've disowned you for such a badly planned reception. Of course bridesmaids got drunk. There was no food! YTA. \n\nWho the hell would stay for brunch? 7 hour journey for such a shifty wedding", "Your wedding reception was poorly planned and poorly executed. People didn't have a great time and were ready to go. Doesn't mean they don't love you, just means you threw a bad party. Them all leaving without saying goodbye the next day sucked, but if you had a dead phone, did they know you were coming over to say goodbye? Were they in a rush to go eat breakfast?\n\nIf you planned for 2 years, how did it go this sideways? I say let it go. There was so much you could control but didn't. Someone else being tired or drunk and hungry is something you might want to not internalize.\n\nYTA. If you want your guests to stay late, give them something good to stay for. Eventually, people needed some sleep. And probably a trip to Burger King.", "Tragic story.\nHow the hell were you at their accommodation for 8am the morning after your wedding night though. I would have been having a lie in until brunch!", "Info: did you ever talk to your family about how you feel? Or did you just refuse to speak to them after you woke up and they had already left? \n\nI understand some of your hurt, but it truly feels like there has been 0 communication about expectations or feelings and instead you\u2019re just giving them the silent treatment to punish them for how you feel without actually trying to resolve anything. If that\u2019s an incorrect account of what happened I\u2019d love to know, but from what you\u2019ve written here you\u2019re behaving quite immaturely.", "I think a lot of information is missing from the bridesmaid and from her family POV.", "YTA. It seems like your family lives far enough away that they probably weren\u2019t involved with the planning, may not have spoken the language many there did and based on the poor planning issues have to ask if you told them what time you would be by in the morning to say goodbye and were you just late or dropping in unannounced? \n\nYou sound very entitled and wrongly upset after they traveled so far to be with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nobody wants to bother the bride and groom after their special day. I can\u2019t speak to that but going NC with them over this seems a bit extreme. Soft YTA.", "NTA. Text them all that you are taking a 6 month break from them and you will let them know after that if you are  interested in continuing the relationship.", "ESH and I really understand where you're coming from and why you're upset but some of the things you are upset about are a bit much. Honestly there's only so much people can try to socialize in a situation like this? You admit people were waiting for 3 hours without food, what is anyone supposed to do about that??  Maybe it wasn't possible to switch things up or you really wanted a certain order for things but did you consider doing something like the dance sooner? I was at a wedding where food took awhile but man 3 hours is like okay I'm ready to leave this event. It sounds like the dance wasn't even until 4/5 hours in and it's really pushing it to expect people (who you admittedly understand struggle waiting three hours for food) to wait even longer for dancing and whatnot. I think a 4/5 hour event alone is a lot so you might want to get a bit more perspective because weddings can be very boring tbh even when everything is timed well.", "Yta.  Be happy they stayed as long as they did.  I went to a poorly planned wedding/reception once.  After being standing outside after the wedding and before the reception for a couple of hourse several of us left.", "YTA, it's all been said but if I had to wait 3 hours for food and till night time for cake cutting/dancing etc I'd either be intoxicated or gone too. You have to understand that the delays and the lack of planning did have an effect on your guests, affecting how long they could stay, and their boredom/drunkenness levels. They weren't just props for your day, they have feelings and reactions too. And how on earth could they have known you were coming the next day and to wait- crystal ball?!", "Yta. Your day was badly planned and caused a long, hungry day for many of your guests, that's on the people who paid for it, not your family. Other than the two drunk bms, who might have been less drunk if food had been better managed, your family aren't really to blame here. You're expectations of them are too high.", "YTA. Your wedding was unorganized. You wanted a dance at 10pm and expected everyone to party the night away? By 9pm, I\u2019m done for the day and I\u2019m 34. You are throwing a tantrum and refusing to speak to them? My guess is that you have never experienced true loss, because this is petty. You are throwing away family and real relationships, because of YOUR doing. If something unexpected or tragic happens to them, you will regret not speaking to them. Again this was YOUR doing, the reception was a flop and your phone was not charged. BTW how were they supposed to know you were coming over, especially when you had a brunch planned? You sound like a brat.", "YTA. It sounds like your wedding did not go as planned because very little planning actually happened. You chose not to have an emcee. You chose to not plan childcare your child. Did you really expect people to offer to watch your child at an event you invited them to? Not trying to excuse the 2 bridesmaids that were belligerently drunk, but with food and dancing being so late, what else was there to do but drink? The next days brunch, why were you surprised no one showed up? Did the invited people confirm that would be there or did you just assume they would be because they were invited? Just based off your post it seems like you made a bunch of assumptions and then were shocked when no one was able to read your mind.", "As someone who works in weddings, YTA. Did you not have a coordinator? Sounds like this was planned terribly and you excepted everyone to go with the flow", "Do you want an award for showing up to your own wedding? Your guests were very patient, your the one making drama. 3 hours with no food or entertainment? That's insanity", "YTA. I've helped plan 4 weddings (including my own). I'm not a wedding planner in any way, shape, or form (just someone with OCPD that likes planning stuff). You completely and totally dropped the ball on this one. Your family was crap too... but, yeah.", "YTA,\n\nDancing at 10 pm? Your family had 30 people compared to 150 people on your husband's side with a language barrier? No food for a long time, I can understand people getting drunk while waiting especially if there's no MC. \n\nYour phone died as well which tells me that there is a severe lack of communication.\n\nI really don't think this is the hill to die on personally, and I am someone that isn't all that close to my family.", "Your family was sitting around for 3 hours with no food? Dancing wasn't supposed to start until after? They were probably tired and ready to leave after sitting around waiting for something eat. \n\nThis was very poorly planned. Why not do some dancing before the food at that point? When did the wedding start?\n\nYTA", "YTA - Your perfect wedding failed due to your and your husband's poor planning; late food service, no emcee, bad timing, how does a person in this century forget to charge their phone?, why didn't you have childcare already planned for your 10 month old?", "Ha\u2026\n\nI get you are hurt and that you wanted a daddy daughter dance but honestly\u2026 3 hrs without food\u2026 you are lucky they stayed for the cake.\n\nFrankly they were still irritated the next morning and just wanted to go home. They were gracious enough to text you thanks and say they had a lovely time (which was obviously an outright lie) and never bring it up again because shit happens and they love you enough to let it slide.\n\nBe a grown up about this. Figure out the part that hurt the most - which sounds like the daddy daughter dance - and find a way to make it better with your family. Apologize for not seeing how they might have felt in the moment and work with your dad to see what y\u2019all can do to repair your hurt and their hurt.\n\nMaybe an anniversary party is in order. In your family\u2019s home town. With a better caterer.", "YTA and your shit show of a wedding is on you. Why no emcee? Why no dedicated babysitter? Why the issues with the food taking 3 hours? No music is mentioned either. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not everyone else\u2019s fault that your phone was dead and they didn\u2019t stick around the next morning to say good bye in person, especially after the shit show the night before and needing to travel so far to get home. \n\nYou have one to blame but you or whoever planned your wedding", "NTA - Forget them like they forgot you. How utterly cruel and selfish of them.", "ESH.   I feel you have the right to be disappointed and you can tell your family why but then you need to let it go and try to reflect on the positive part of being married to your husband. It sucks not having family or close relationships and  realizing you don't matter to people. \n\nI think establishing boundaries before fully deciding no contact is a better decision.\n\nWhile I feel your family should stuck around - you as a bride could have expressed timelines better on when you want bridal party to stay too or do things.", "ESH- That wedding sounds like it was a hot mess. Which is unfortunate. But it sounds like in all the chaos there wasn't really any set expectations. Why did it take three hours for food? What was everyone doing while all this was happening? You could have done the dances before the food since the wait was so long. And it's not their fault your phone was dead. And the bridesmaids getting belligerent drunk is on them. But... they also had no food while they drinking during that long ass wait.", "This. Especially the \"my phone was dead. But couldn't they have waited 15 minutes for me to come say bye?\" How were they supposed to know that's how long to wait. They had no communication with OP to know when OP was getting up, when OP would be coming by", "Not to mention OP says nothing about communicating anything to her family. Like, did she just go totally silent without saying why she is hurt? It gives her even less of a leg to stand on TBH", "NAH\n\nJust poor communication and planning, all the way around.", "Tbh French weddings last a LONG time, I think that timing for dancing is normal.", "Don't forget that 150 of those invited were OP's husband's family, which is just rude.\n\nI have a particularly large family on my dad's side, with my grandfather's descendants and their spouses numbering around 160 people and another 50 people on my mum's side.\n\nMy brother has his wedding this weekend and even though we have such a big family, his wife has a much smaller family and list of people they want to invite. Equal numbers are being invited from both sides, based on how many they want to invite.\n\nAlso you can't have a wedding where your family speak a different language to the other 75% of people there and get upset that they're not socialising", "And her family/guests suck how?", "OP\u2019s family was treated like an afterthought the entire time. Why would her family stick around to be ignored some more?", "After 3 hrs of waiting on food and not knowing anyone you can bet I'd be playing games on my phone just waiting for the 1st opportunity to get out of there.\n\nAnd when I have an 8 hr trip home, yeah I'm up and out the door really early so that I can get home and relax.\n\nYTA", "And, the bridal party had probably had a long day of getting ready, pictures, etc. I\u2019ve heard many stories of brides forgetting that people need to be fed during that part of things. Those bridesmaids may have been running on fumes.", "That's why I don't drink, or i limit my drinking when I haven't had food.\n\nI had one time where I went out to dinner with a friend, and hadn't really thought about how I hadn't eaten all day (I worked the night shift and had only been awake a couple hours at that point. But it was 4pm and I hadn't eaten since midnight) and I sipped on a drink. I probably had like a 10th, if that, to drink and was feeling it HARD. So i STOPPED until I got food. And I don't even think I finished it...\n\nAt a wedding, 100% would have done the same. No way am I getting drunk enough to get kicked out at a wedding.", "Sorry, OP - this is all on you. I would have been drunk too if I waited that long for food. You didn\u2019t communicate well , and now you are stuck with the results. YTA all the way.", "Not to mention that they had tried to get ahold of OP that morning before they left but her phone had died.

Especially after all of the delays the previous day.", "Bingo. Yes.\n\nHer wedding showed her family who she is. They just believed her.", "You don't even have to pay someone to do it. That's what gets me. \n\nI grew up in an area where \"fire house\" wedding receptions were common. Sometimes the MC was an Uncle or other relative. \n\nSomebody has to coordinate things.

And for the record, missing it broke his heart.", "She literally says that both of her parents have health problems significant enough that they won't be around to watch her 10-month-old grow up. That says to me that they may not be well enough for a late night. Given that she KNOWS THAT, why on earth would she leave the Father-Daughter dance until well after 10 PM?!", "But in all those hours waiting for food and what not why didn't they do it? Why did she wait until 10? She says she was trying to keep people entertained, yet that would have been a great way to keep people entertained", "NAH except the two bridesmaids that had to be ejected. \n\nAlthough depending on how bad the dinner service got, they might not have even realized how the alcohol was going to affect them. Drinking on an empty stomach after a stress filled day is never a good idea.", "Ahhh, but did her parents know this? \n\nWhen blending cultures at an event its important that everyone is on the same page.", "Her bridesmaid suck for getting themselves kicked out from drinking too much. Her dad sucks for leaving before the dance. Everybody sucks for not communicating. I think she has a right to be upset and disappointed with them.

The whole thing sounds like a shit show.", "If I were a guest I'd assume the brunch (if I knew it existed!) would run crazy late and make me miss the ferry!", "That's a weird order to me. Most weddings I know are Ceremony, Cocktails, Dinner, Speeches, Dessert, Dance.", "Yup. Exactly. Could be waiting 15 minutes. Couod be waiting 2 hours.\n\nThis sort of makes me wonder, why was OPs phone still dead at 8am? My suspicion is her and her husband had been up all night partying. That when she did charge it, it was the first chance she'd gotten to doing so.\n\nIf her and her husband had gone back to where they were staying for their wedding night, even if it was late, she should have had a chance to charge it. Maybe wouldn't have done it before going to sleep, if it meant digging the charger out of a bag to plug in. But certainly could have had time to do so after waking up to let it charge while freshening up. It's not like it takes that long to charge one enough to turn on and check messages.\n\nThe other possibility that comes to mind, if they hadn't been partying all night, is that maybe OP hadn't packed the charger in an overnight bag, and had left it where her family was staying.\n\nIn any case, it is suggestive of more poor planning on OPs part.", "I had my cousin's long term boyfriend be the mc/organizer at my wedding . He loves doing stuff like that and was a perfect fit. Of course, he just basically had to make a few announcements to herd people for certain events since it was rather informal. A formal wedding where I am from usually has the DJ making announcements as to what's happening next. Usually there is also a designated family member or wedding coordinator working with the DJ to make sure things are running smoothly.", "Tell us more.

I know how weddings are done in my area. \n\nUsually, in my area the Bride and Groom are not around for the cocktail hour, that's for the guests and the bridal party uses the time to regroup after pictures after the ceremony. (A private cocktail hour is usually included in venues for this) \n\nThen the Bridal party \"arrives\" bride and groom are introduced and thats when the key dances are done. First dance as a couple and the parents dances. ( everyone is seated for dinner and focused on the key players) \n\nThen the dinner, speeches/toasts are at the end of or during dinner. (Usually when people are still seated) Cutting the cake usually intrupts the party dancing.", ">The other possibility that comes to mind, if they hadn't been partying all night, is that maybe OP hadn't packed the charger in an overnight bag, and had left it where her family was staying.\n\nI mean, tbh, things were so hectic when I got married that my suitcase ended up in some random relative's car after they hastily cleaned up the room we got dressed in and I had no pants to wear to the brunch the next morning (I did have my dress from the rehearsal dinner in the car, so I opted for that instead of my wedding dress). Losing track of a phone charger is 1000% feasible, but getting so mad that people left (when they couldn't get ahold of you) that you don't talk to them for \\*months\\* is unhinged.", "In france these dances are not a thing. Maybe the Father seeing how the wedding wasn't adapted to his culture didn't know to expect it.", "Is that a thing outside the states?", "Only about 1/3 of the weddings I've ever been to have had one to be fair... it's a weirdly antiquated holdover from when dads \"gave away\" their daughters and isn't super common in Canada from my experience.\n\nThe bride and groom have the first dance, and then everybody else dances.", "I didn't have a father-daughter dance. I haven't seen one in recent weddings I've been to, either, so perhaps they've fallen out of trend.", "I did something similar. I did my first dance with my husband before dinner in my wedding gown. Then after dinner I changed so we could start the REAL dancing. No father-daughter dance though.", "Very true. And yes, I can imagine misplacing a charger day of happens semi-regularly with weddings these days.\n\nI will admit my own wedding was long enough ago that cell phones were barely a thing. Neither my spouse or I had one of our own. If we had one with us during our honeymoon, it would have been because we were borrowing from my parents.\n\nBut either then or now, if my cell phone was running low and I didn't know when I'd be able to charge it, I'd be taking measures to conserve the remaining charge. The easiest of which is to just stop using it. Put it away and let it just be a phone. It will eventually run down, sure, but that could be hours. Could be even more if the built-in power saving modes modern phones have are enabled.\n\nAnd yes, regardless of why the phone didn't get charged, OPs reaction is definitely outsized for the situation. The funny thing is, while it sounds like it started because she was mad at them, the longer she continues, the greater the chance it has to turn around and become a situation where they're disinclined to talk much, if at all, to her.", "It isn't in England", "Agreed, or not a big thing. Not a single friend of mine had a father/daughter dance at their wedding, and they all have good relationships with their dads"]}
