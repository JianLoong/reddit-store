In the meantime, lock down your account - if she's ever had her name on it, close it and open a new one elsewhere. Definitely use a totally different PIN for your card.

It might be more effective to just tell him that you expect the money back immediately and that taking it was not acceptable. If he is reasonable, hopefully he will give the money back. If he is not reasonable, I doubt that threatening to charge interest will make him more likely to pay.
