Your SIL is welcome to go to work at the farm if she is that concerned about her daughter", "NTA.  Don't start a job you know you're going to hate, especially not a farm job.  A lot of my mother's family are dairy farmers.  It is hard work and you have to at least like farming and owning your own business or you'll have a miserable life.", "NTA... If SIL is throwing a fit about her daughter needing help then SIL can do it. You don't need that job and you shouldn't be miserable because of a spoiled golden child. How dare her baby have to work and work hard", "NTA.\n\nHaving ranching experience myself, ONE person won't make that much of an impact on a 14-acre property that only has 4 employees at the moment. So your SIL's kid would still be burnt out - there's no reason to sacrifice your own well-being for an extremely marginal improvement.\n\nCircumstances have to be met to successfully work with family - even if you usually get along with them, it's not always successful. And since you're not desperate at the moment, there's no point in putting up with that kind of dynamic.\n\nI hope your husband supports your choice to stand your ground.", "What? No. These people don't get to throw fits and have meltdowns because you choose not to take a job you don't want. Your husband, though, is an asshole for equating you standing your ground with their encroachment upon it and not sticking up for you. You are certainly not being childish by not taking a job you don't want and don't absolutely need. It boggles the mind that people can be having meltdowns over your choice not to commit to something as serious as taking a job.\n\nNTA.", "I mean if you don\u2019t need the work\u2026then you don\u2019t need it.\n\nSounds like you don\u2019t.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Tell them to shut the fudge up.", "Nta. Modern phones have this thing called block. Use and move on. However does sound like she\u2019s getting karma for stealing kids food.", "Nta. Even if your SILs daughter was the sweetest person and your favorite person, still you wouldn\u2019t be TA with this decision. \n\nIf things are really uncomfortable I\u2019d lie and say you are interviewing for your dream company already. And don\u2019t want jinx it by talking about it", "NTA\n\nWhat you do for a living is completely your decision.\n\nAlso who tf feeds someone else's food to their the dogs from the table!? I hope that wasnt to teach your children a lesson... It sounds like you SIL has an problems with boundaries and I would suggest if it gets out of hand further to cease communication with her for a while. Maybe \"teach her a lesson not to overstep a boundary.\"\n\nEdit: I reread and saw from your kids plates.. fuck that.", "NTA.  The fact that your husband wants you to keep the peace and help someone who steals his kids' food is shitty behavior from him at best", "NTA", "Wait, your husband thinks you're being childish because you don't want to work on a goat farm with his entitled niece? You're NTA but everyone from his side is.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with refusing to work at a job that you despise. It is a shame SIL's daughter is overworked, but how is that your issue?\n\nNot only that you hate the job, but your resentment will grow every day if you were to spend your time on the goat farm. If your husband doesn't like the split between you and his family now, can you imagine it after 3-6 months of you working at that farm?  Stay strong in your convictions.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to your labor. There\u2019s a reason they can\u2019t find anyone to work for them. \n\n\nI managed a small company for almost 10 years. My boss was awful to work for and my job was to be a buffer between him and staff. I had to laugh at all the people boo-hooing on the news during covid complaining about how people are lazy and don\u2019t want to work. I guarantee these are the people who try and pay minimum wage and expect expert level workers.\n\nIf no one wants to work for them, there is absolutely a reason why.", "That's a lot of unnecessary cursing...
