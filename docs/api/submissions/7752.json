{"id": 7752, "submission_id": "10fzb3j", "title": "AITA for canceling ski trip with my GF?", "selftext": " \n\nMe 25M GF 22F planned on going skiing in February. She asked me if she can bring her cousin because they go on ski trips annually and it sounded like a great idea. I decided to invite my friend and we were all hyped to go. So here is where it got a little weird, I explained that I usually use snow blades which are shorter skis and my GF says that she\u2019s never heard of them, she seems indifferent and then she asks \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just use normal skis\u201d. I then explain that I think they\u2019re more fun and I just like skiing on them more. She starts talking about how they might be unsafe and she doesn\u2019t feel okay with me using them. I reassure her that they are actually safe and it\u2019s not really a problem since I've been skiing on them since I was 12 . We check the website and I see that the option for renting snow blades is not available but there is a multi choice option where you get to choose different type of skis and even snowboard through the day, this cost 17 euros more , I saw snow blades on the picture and told her to choose the multi choice for me .The way we planned this trip is that the girls (GF and her cousin) rent the skis and me and my friend rent the car. So  she tells me that she\u2019s not going to pick the multi choice renting kit for me and that she is going to get everybody normal skis, I then ask why? She proceeds to tell me that she doesn't know what they are and they don\u2019t sound unsafe, I tell her that sounds illogical and we start arguing about this dumb topic over the phone. After this I send her videos and pictures of the snowblades, she is still not budging.\n\nHer reasons:\n\n1. Snow blades seem unsafe, and she doesn't know how they work. She will not be able to help me if I get hurt, but with normal skis she can help me because she knows how they work.\n2. They cost more and she says I am saving money and she has my best interest at heart when she says this.\n3. I am making the booking process difficult for them because they have to book mine separately (this is not really true) she was assuming.\n\nMy counters:\n\n1. They're the same as skis, only shorter.\n2. Thank you for caring, but it's in my budget and 17 euros will not hurt especially on an one off thing like this\n3. It takes 2 clicks to add my kit to the renting order\n\nShe says you can book your own skis, I tell her fine I will do that. She then tells me that she doesn't trust me to book it by myself, because I opt out of trips and activities and don\u2019t book tickets and so on.\n\nThis gets me irritated and I cancel and tell her that I\u2019m going with my friends instead. Now she's saying that I prioritize my friends over her and always make things difficult.\n\nTo be honest I do spend a lot of time with my friends but that is because we don't live in the same city and I have opted out when we plan something together but that's because I can't afford whatever we planned sometimes. But I only wanted to go and have fun with them this time.

Why are you accepting her ruling your life as your mother?", "Your gf sounds exhausting.  You made the strategic error by cancelling the trip.  Instead you should have said: no worries, please just rent the skies for yourself as you please.  Know that on the day of the trip, since I don't have my blades yet, we will drive by the rental shop to pick up my blades.  \n\nDon't get yourself tangled up in someone's emotional manipulation.  Your arguments were rational and correct.  \n\nNTA, but you need to learn how to better handle these types of pressure.", "NTA. She\u2019s right about you opting out of trips that you have to book things yourself (this trip as an example) but the larger issue is her trying to control you over something as minor as ski types. You should be allowed to use whichever type of ski that you want.", "NTA - this was extremely petty. I dont know why your girlfriend has an ax to grind about these snow blades. Cancelling the trip seems a bit petty but if shes already being this ridiculous you may want to look into canceling your relationship", "NTA. \n\nSo you want to use the things that you have been using since you were 12? Big freakin' deal. It's sweet that she cares about your safety, but if she has never heard of them or used them, it's not really fair to assume that they are anymore dangerous than using skis. \n\nPlus, you're the one that's using them. Not her. If you want to use the blades, use them. Good grief. Why she made it such a big deal,  \"I'm not gonna order those. You order them yourself. No, I don't trust you to order them\"...Etc...Seems like being way more difficult than is necessary. haha.", "NTA   Sounds like classic narcissism, \"I haven't heard of them so they're not a thing\"... Is she always controlling like this?", "NTA 1 she's not your mother.\n2 just because she doesn't know what they are doesn't mean a thing.\n3 no skiing is 100% safe onlt takes someone to fall wrong and that's some broken bones.\n4 she's the one making things difficult", "NTA - it's nice of her to care about your safety but you're an adult and therefore it should be your choice what skis you use. You tried to work with her on the problem but she refused to budge so I think it's fair of you to change plans.", "NTA\n\nI am irritated only by reading this. \n\n\"I don't know what snow blades are so they must be unsafe and that is dangerous\" Now change snow blades with normal everyday things. \"I don't know what a pan is so it must be unsafe and dangerous\" so you will never learn to cook? \n\nAlso what's with that type of wanting to control what you will use?", "NTA- is she going to clip your skis and helmet herself as well to make sure you wear them right? Is she going to pick the colour of them as well? \n\nYour skis are available to rent, so they must be safe enough as they would not be available at the resort otherwise. And given that you've been using those half of your life, I think she should trust your judgment more that her own guessing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She sounds very controlling.", "NTA.\n\nIf the blades are what you want, you've been using them since a young age, your GF should've accepted that considering she admits to not knowing what they are but can deem they are unsafe? What? Also, I would've canceled too. She is treating you like you are a child and it sounds controlling, not out of concern.", "NTA, your GF sounds controlling.", "NTA, she's funny, and if this is her skiing hill to die on, so be it. Imagine that you marry her and have to face such situations again and again?", "Get a GF that lives in your area.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhat does she expect to happen different when you hurt yourself on snow blades compared to normal skis?! This sounds so hilarious :D", "\u201cI know nothing about this but it\u2019s unsafe.\u201d Sounds like every conversation with an Anti-Vaxer I\u2019ve ever had! #topical\n\nNTA. Your GF is being difficult and controlling. You\u2019re a grown man, and as long as you\u2019re not planing on juggling samurai swords while skiing blindfolded, I don\u2019t see why she doesn\u2019t trust you to make this decision yourself.  Go with your amigos and have a good time.", "NTA, that's super controlling. But it makes me wonder: is this a normal thing for her, to try to keep you from doing things that don't meet her approval? If so, that's something that needs to be dealt with more than just cancelling a trip. I'd be concerned about future events, trying to control your actions and your spending and not trusting you to do things for yourself. If not, it sounds like there may be something deeper here, some reason she fears you using the snowblades. Either way, sounds like you two need to talk, because I don't see a good future if you can't go on a vacation together without this kind of drama.", "NTA. She said you're the one making things difficult, but she's making things difficult by not just booking the skis you want to use. You've been using those blades since you were 12 so you know what you're doing, she's just being controlling for zero reason. Then when you say you'll just book them yourself, she continues to find ways to be difficult about it for again, no reason. Honestly she sounds like a bit of a nightmare to book things with and I don't blame you for just wanting to go with your buddy and do your own thing.", "Nta. She seems like a piece of work, starting a full blown argument over a ski type that you want to use? You should ask yourself, what the future will bring with such a controlling person, and if thats what you want from the life. This injury argument was kinda ridiculous too, if one gets injured while skiing its same type of injuries no matter if the person used skis or blades. Seems she just wants to control you in every minor aspect and is willing to start a fight when every small detail won't go exactly her way. Exhausting... I think you'll have way more fun with your friends on that trip. They wouldn't try to control your every breath at least...", ">She then tells me that she doesn't trust me to book it by myself, because I opt out of trips and activities and don\u2019t book tickets and so on.\n\n>This gets me irritated and I cancel and tell her that I\u2019m going with my friends instead. \n\n>Now she's saying that I prioritize my friends over her and always make things difficult.\n\n>To be honest I do spend a lot of time with my friends\n\n>I have opted out when we plan something together but that's because I can't afford whatever we planned sometimes.\n\nFunniest shit ever. She called you out on your mess and you literally did the exact thing. And you said 17 euros wasn't going to break the bank but you then said you've bailed on plans because you can't afford it.\n\n\nLook she obviously has real concerns here about the safety of blades and for you. You should have let her book and pay for skis like you planned. She doesn't want to pay for something that could kill you.\n\nI don't understand why you didn't just book your own snow blades or get a rental before heading up there. Unless you're skiing in back country why don't you take her to a safety demo/instruction class to get her more comfortable. And then show her you know how to use it.\n\nNAH cause she has reason to be concerned and you can want to use equipment you enjoy.  Although you are heading into dickish land and are the ahole for  bailing on her because you didn't get your way and validating everything she said.", "NTA. It's almost like she is being  so difficult so that you do drop out of the trip and she can turn around and blame you.", "NTA, but your GF is going overboard.  She doesn't trust that you know how to use them, and she doesn't trust you to book the rental.  You've assured her numerous times that they are not dangerous and you've been skiing with them for years, but she doesn't know how they work, so that's her basis for saying no?  That's silly.  She's disrespecting you and being a control freak.  Why wouldn't you prioritize your friends over her?", "She sounds exhausting.  NTA", "I would\u2019ve canceled too. If she\u2019s this difficult about the blades now she would have been 10* worse on the actual trip when you were renting/using them. NTA", "NTA she is illogical and controlling and hard work. Be careful with controlling people who hide how controlling they are with sentences saying they are just worried about you, they just want you to be safe, they are concerned about you, they are doing this for your own good.", "This. OP, are you even happy in this relationship? I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life being treated like this by someone.", "This is what I used to do, but now I\u2019m trying to communicate better, being reasonable and getting along is the goal for me. That\u2019s why I felt like canceling the trip was kinda being TA", "Especially a type of skis that have been around longer than this woman has been alive. In fact I remember seeing them a full decade before this woman was born.\n\nNot to mention the fact that it really doesnt matter which device you use, it's about your skill.\n\nIn a battle between you vs the tag-team of gravity and a mountain, which tiny plank of wood-composites you choose is not the going to be the deciding factor in your safety.", "Lol I like how she said if he gets hurt with the blades she won't know how to help him, but if he gets hurt (same injuries most likely) with regular skis she can help him. AKA I just want to be difficult for no reason here", "I mean, there's always the option of finding someone who is more compatible and less difficult and not having to deal with this sort of thing anymore lol just saying."]}
