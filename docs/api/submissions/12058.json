He doesn't understand how you chose your job and comfort over Alex's care?\n\nYou should explain to him that your job is also how you maintain a roof over your head and feed yourself.

Otherwise, you wouldn't be doing yourself or Alex any good.\n\nPersonally, I thought it was very kind and generous of you to offer to help pay for institutional help.", "NTA.

You offered up an option that would help your family and work with your lifestyle - and also keep Alex in a familiar place which is probably the best thing for him. Your dad rejected it. That\u2019s his decision. It\u2019s on your dad now to figure out the best solution here.", "NTA and you were very generous in offering to pay. You do need to make it clear to your parents that you will not care for your brother when they pass or become unable to care for him themselves. They need to find a place for him where they feel confident that he'll be well looked after, and the best thing for your brother is if he moved there before something happens to your parents. I don't know the extent of his disabilities but I think it's cruel of parents to keep their child at home until something happens, and their child has to deal with both moving into a new place with new people caring for them *and* deal with the loss of their parents.", "NTA disabled adults need to find a good placement before it becomes an emergency placement when their parents pass away.", "NTA. Tell dad that its either accept your very generous offer to psy fir outside help or deal with Alex on his own.", "Nta\n\nThe big thing that's eventually coming up though, your parents 100% expect you to be his caretaker when they are gone. You need to have a talk with them yesterday to make it clear they need to start saving and planning for his care when they pass, because he'll need it if neither your other sibling are (understandably) not doing it.", "NTA.  What I always find surprising about these issues is this.  If you, for whatever reason, moved across the world, what would your parents do?  Call your married brother?  Probably not.  They would hire someone to assist them.  Because you\u2019re single, and in their way of thinking, don\u2019t have any personal family responsibilities, you\u2019re expected to drop everything and help them.  If your parents are getting on in age and health, who is going to care for your brother when they\u2019re no longer in the picture?  Do they expect you to be the unmarried sister whose responsibility it is to care for your brother for the remainder of your lives?  He\u2019s your brother but not your lifelong responsibility.  Send your parents some information as to where they can get assistance then get on with your life.", "NTA How exactly does your father think you\u2019re going to survive without your job!?", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t entitled to stoping your whole life to take care of an adult. They need to petition the state and get him support.", "INFO: is your mom\u2019s condition something that is likely to be resolved soon?  Like, take a week or two of leave? Or is it something more nebulous or permanent?", "NTA\n\nHow are you supposed to pay the bills, and keep yourself and your brother fed and clothed, with no income?  Your father clearly hasn't thought through the practicalities of how this will work.  Have your parents saved so much money that you and your brother will be able to afford to live if you give up your job to care for him?\n\nGiven time, it's 100% sure that this won't be a one time temporary thing while your mother gets over her health issues.  With time, the strength and health of your parents will decline, and a long-term solution is needed.\n\nIf their only plan for your brother is that you will quit everything and care for him, what will happen if you get hit by the Hypothetical Bus tomorrow?  What's going to happen as he gets older, and you get older, and your strength decreases.  What will it look like when you're 66 and your brother is 70?\n\nYour parents need to figure out a long-term solution for his care and support.  That isn't just you.  If you're in the US, they need to establish their legal guardianship of him, and get him legally defined as disabled, so that he's eligible for Medicaid and its long-term care programs. He needs to be in a day program, so that he gets to interact with the community and continue to learn to care for himself. He needs the financial benefits that the government provides for disabled individuals.  He needs to be under the supervision of a social services agency that provides care for adults with disabilities, so that a team of professionals (doctor, nurse, PT, OT,  speech therapist, etc.) can get him the help he needs.  He needs to have a whole line of backup guardians set up, so if anything happens to whomever is supervising his care, there are people ready to step in and keep an eye on things.  He needs to be in a group home or some other place where responsibility for his care is shared among many people, as it's going to be too much for one person eventually.  \n\nThink \"Long-Term Care Plan\" not \"Take care of him until mom's health improves and she takes up the care again.\"  \n\nFor you, as a sibling, there is a huge difference between your parents asking you to be a legal guardian for him, as he lives in a group home, goes to day treatment program, and gets help and care from professionals, versus just having care for him dumped on you without support. \n\nWhile your parents should be the ones planning his long term care, it doesn't sound as if they're doing appropriate planning.  It's in your own interest to push for an appropriate long term care plan, because otherwise, when your parents die or become to elderly to care for him, you'll have a lot of pressure to step in, and you'll feel torn between wanting to ensure he's cared for and caring for yourself, and you'll be rushed into decisions without knowing what options are available, or having the time to research the various options and work to get him into the best place for him, versus just a place with an open bed.", "Dad just wants a free carer.", "NTA. You are not your brother\u2019s keeper just because you were siblings.
