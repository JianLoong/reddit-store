That\u2019s his decision. It\u2019s on your dad now to figure out the best solution here.", "NTA and you were very generous in offering to pay. You do need to make it clear to your parents that you will not care for your brother when they pass or become unable to care for him themselves. They need to find a place for him where they feel confident that he'll be well looked after, and the best thing for your brother is if he moved there before something happens to your parents. I don't know the extent of his disabilities but I think it's cruel of parents to keep their child at home until something happens, and their child has to deal with both moving into a new place with new people caring for them *and* deal with the loss of their parents.", "NTA disabled adults need to find a good placement before it becomes an emergency placement when their parents pass away.", "NTA. Tell dad that its either accept your very generous offer to psy fir outside help or deal with Alex on his own.", "Nta\n\nThe big thing that's eventually coming up though, your parents 100% expect you to be his caretaker when they are gone. You need to have a talk with them yesterday to make it clear they need to start saving and planning for his care when they pass, because he'll need it if neither your other sibling are (understandably) not doing it.", "NTA.  What I always find surprising about these issues is this.  If you, for whatever reason, moved across the world, what would your parents do?  Call your married brother?  Probably not.  They would hire someone to assist them.  Because you\u2019re single, and in their way of thinking, don\u2019t have any personal family responsibilities, you\u2019re expected to drop everything and help them.  If your parents are getting on in age and health, who is going to care for your brother when they\u2019re no longer in the picture?  Do they expect you to be the unmarried sister whose responsibility it is to care for your brother for the remainder of your lives?  He\u2019s your brother but not your lifelong responsibility.  Send your parents some information as to where they can get assistance then get on with your life.", "NTA How exactly does your father think you\u2019re going to survive without your job!?", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t entitled to stoping your whole life to take care of an adult. They need to petition the state and get him support.", "INFO: is your mom\u2019s condition something that is likely to be resolved soon?  Like, take a week or two of leave? Or is it something more nebulous or permanent?", "NTA\n\nHow are you supposed to pay the bills, and keep yourself and your brother fed and clothed, with no income?  Your father clearly hasn't thought through the practicalities of how this will work.  Have your parents saved so much money that you and your brother will be able to afford to live if you give up your job to care for him?\n\nGiven time, it's 100% sure that this won't be a one time temporary thing while your mother gets over her health issues.  With time, the strength and health of your parents will decline, and a long-term solution is needed.\n\nIf their only plan for your brother is that you will quit everything and care for him, what will happen if you get hit by the Hypothetical Bus tomorrow?  What's going to happen as he gets older, and you get older, and your strength decreases.  What will it look like when you're 66 and your brother is 70?\n\nYour parents need to figure out a long-term solution for his care and support.  That isn't just you.  If you're in the US, they need to establish their legal guardianship of him, and get him legally defined as disabled, so that he's eligible for Medicaid and its long-term care programs. He needs to be in a day program, so that he gets to interact with the community and continue to learn to care for himself. He needs the financial benefits that the government provides for disabled individuals.  He needs to be under the supervision of a social services agency that provides care for adults with disabilities, so that a team of professionals (doctor, nurse, PT, OT,  speech therapist, etc.) can get him the help he needs.  He needs to have a whole line of backup guardians set up, so if anything happens to whomever is supervising his care, there are people ready to step in and keep an eye on things.  He needs to be in a group home or some other place where responsibility for his care is shared among many people, as it's going to be too much for one person eventually.  \n\nThink \"Long-Term Care Plan\" not \"Take care of him until mom's health improves and she takes up the care again.\"  \n\nFor you, as a sibling, there is a huge difference between your parents asking you to be a legal guardian for him, as he lives in a group home, goes to day treatment program, and gets help and care from professionals, versus just having care for him dumped on you without support. \n\nWhile your parents should be the ones planning his long term care, it doesn't sound as if they're doing appropriate planning.  It's in your own interest to push for an appropriate long term care plan, because otherwise, when your parents die or become to elderly to care for him, you'll have a lot of pressure to step in, and you'll feel torn between wanting to ensure he's cared for and caring for yourself, and you'll be rushed into decisions without knowing what options are available, or having the time to research the various options and work to get him into the best place for him, versus just a place with an open bed.", "Dad just wants a free carer.", "NTA. You are not your brother\u2019s keeper just because you were siblings.

Maybe go low contact.", "NTA\n\nIt is so sad at the number of posts you see of parents not making plans for disabled children pressuring siblings to just stop their lives and take on the caregiving.\n\nIt is your (the) parents responsibility to make end of life arrangements for their disabled children.  This CAN include siblings, if that is their choice and not by guilt or pressure.\n\nEventually your brother will be alone, so maybe it is time to start making these plans and begin moving that direction.\n\nStay strong.", ">My dad told me he couldn't believe how I could choose my **job** and comfort over my disabled brother.\n\nI think people must be kidding themselves. Most people can't just quit their jobs to be a caretaker. Is your dad going to pay your bills? No? Okay. You offered to pay for help and he turned it down. Your dad wants Alex in your house from now on. Let's be real. He played a fantasy where you don't have kids or a SO so you're available to do this in his mind. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I have a child on the spectrum and have been caring for people with intellectual and physical disabilities for almost 25 years. Perhaps it's time for your parents to find your brother a placement.

And they have no plan??\nDo not let them guilt you.", "NTA. \n\nYour older brother should not be your responsibility, you're a grown adult with a job and a life, your dad should understand that. But I do have remorse for the dad, having to look after both his wife and son. But he should have some understanding for you, even after you offer to pay for a nurse?", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m disappointed in him as a parent. Not because he was preoccupied with his disabled child. But because he failed you enough that you\u2019re 26 and not out to them. That speaks volumes of their parenting, support, and their general relationship with you. \n\nI\u2019m also disappointed in him for thinking that it\u2019s his child\u2019s responsibility to care for his child. \n\nDon\u2019t do it. Please realize he\u2019s likely just trying to set things up so that you take over and are ready to take on the primary caregiver role when they\u2019re no longer able to or aren\u2019t here to do so. \n\nMake it clear that you\u2019re not ab option; that this isn\u2019t your responsibility; and that you will not - under any circumstances - be taking your brother in.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm disappointed in your father as a person, and you could please tell him that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then hang up the phone.", "Whoa - You offered a reasonable solution to help, hired a nurse,  care provider,  someone. Your dad refused!  There is more here going than you are saying or maybe willing to admit.

My brothers do and they don't really require much care besides making sure they are good and they've ate. I'm guessing dad is too lazy or wants to use Alex's benefits so he doesnt have to find other care for him. What's going to happen when the parents are too old to care for him? They need to figure out a plan now and its not fair to put it on OP.", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents need to look for long term care for your brother. This is their responsibility. They should do this now while they are both able to find a care home for your brother. You are not obligated to give your life up to care for your brother.

You have an autistic sibling and you\u2019re LGBTQ, both of which I believe increase the likelihood.", "Exactly! Also OP I would bet dollars to donuts, your parents plans for the future include you caring for them And Alex in there old age and then just Alex after they pass away. Nip that in the bud right now.", "The bigger issue is why did they have another child afterwards to begin with. Like if it's so much work, don't continue breeding more.", "NTA. OP, you offering to pay for a nurse was wonderful. If you're close and can drop by once a week or something to give your dad time to go to the store, take a nap, or whatever, that would be kind too... but not something you have to do.\n\nYour dad is probably feeling sensitive because his life is really hard. If he's a good person, he'll apologize at some point.", "This is the way.", "I mean, that's the thing, it sounds like something major already *has* happened with significant impact on their ability to take care of Alex.

Why would she want to spill salt into her father's wound? How is that better than dozens of other options, including simply saying \"sorry, I can't do it\"?\n\nFkn terrible advice.", "Damn, what's up with that last line? Are you for real? Sickening...", "Seriously...I hate to say it but it sounds like mom being in poor health is, while not a *good* thing, at least bringing up some very necessary conversations. OP's parents aren't going to be able to take care of Alex forever, and it sounds like neither OP or her other brother are willing or able to take him in.", "> My dad told me he couldn't believe how I could choose my job and comfort over my disabled brother.\n\nI am always amazed at people that think \"I would lose my job\" is the same as \"my job is more important\".

The offer to help pay for a nurse is incredibly generous and the father got upset because it took the wind out of the planned guilt sails. He only planned for yes or no, she offered an unbelievably generous curveball where he doesn't lose the caretaking burden nor can he emotionally blackmail the simple \"no\".", "it doesn't go. no sibling is ever responsible for another, whether older or younger. older siblings, it seems, are often made to feel responsible for looking after their younger siblings in some capacity. but they shouldn't be.\n\nthat's my feelings at least. there are countries that legally mandate you look after your parents in their dotage (even if they were abusive), so there might be places that mandate caring for siblings and stuff too.", "How so?\n\nAlex is none of OP's problem.\n\nWhy should OP have to suffer because of it?", "Honestly, maybe I've been in reddit too long, but I bet dad wanted to take Alex to his sister and never get him back. Once mom (hopefully)  got better, dad would say something along the lines of \"you're doing so good with him, and when we die, he will live with you anyway. \"", "Oh, yeah I would believe that.
