Lately it\u2019s been more concentrated to his right foot. Because of this he can\u2019t go to work, he works in construction. Throughout the years we\u2019ve seen specialized doctors, however they\u2019ll just give a bit of gout medicine and tell him to see a primary care doctor. He\u2019s always refused this. But recently when we\u2019ve had to go he decided to finally go for a primary care visit. The earliest appt they had for the location closest to us wasn\u2019t until the 27, but he wasn\u2019t that bad and was still working when I made the appointment. Yesterday was the follow up and he thought he was going to get more gout medicine, but didn\u2019t. Was mostly told it could be gout or something else, but that was for the primary care. However they did say they had another doctor that he could see today in another town. He declined as he wanted to work today. \n\nWe\u2019ve been low on money as last year I gave birth to twins and already have one other child, so childcare was too expensive, and so I stay home to take care of the kids. We used to have grandparents watch the one, but both sides said 3 would be too difficult, which I agree and have no issue with.\n\nBut today when he woke up he discovered once again he couldn\u2019t walk. So I talked to him about moving up that primary visit to sooner as I had only made the appt for what was physically close to us, but I\u2019m sure they had appts in other towns that were closer time wise, and he said sure. So I called and made one for this Thursday and when I told him he immediately became upset.\n\nHe went off to say how I don\u2019t pay for any bills around here and how he doesn\u2019t have money to pay for upcoming bills. How I was so stupid for trying to make an appointment this week and so on. But my logic in all of this was he declined an appointment he could\u2019ve seen someone today for work, but he didn\u2019t go. He probably won\u2019t get better for Thursday, so it would be better to just go and get the blood tests and what not. \n\nI have offered in the past to work with a guy that has a moving business as he offered flexible work hours or to work part time, but he always declined it. I do work on Saturdays cleaning a church and give that money to him, $500 a month. Our rent here is $525, so it\u2019s supposed to go to that.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1689081165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wr1n6/aita_for_trying_to_schedule_an_earlier_doctor/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think there was a case not so long ago in my country where the lady sued her x husband after he wanted to leave her with nothing.  They included amongst many others, daycare, uber, schooling, Nany services and others and let's not forget potential loss of income because you denied that person the opportunity. The amount at the end was very high. I agreed with the verdict. These people who think working at home counts for nothing should think again.\n\nSorry for going on a tangent but your husbands seems like he can bully you because of this fact. That is why I advocate for people to have their own jobs and finances to prevent crap like this. You should not have to walk on eggshells because he is the \" provider.\"", "He had said I wasn\u2019t using my head as he declined an appt this week already when the nurse offered yesterday.
