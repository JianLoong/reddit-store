She's honestly a shark with negotiations, and it's amazing. Like she can look a guy in the eyes with a straight face and tell him that 260k isn't a high enough salary. \n\nThen she donates every extra dollar she has to local food banks, bail bonds, to support tenants and workers unions, and mutual aid groups. And with the jobs she's getting, shes giving away 200 thousand dollars a year. It's still insane to me. \n\nShe's asked me to keep it quiet around town because she doesn't want it getting back to her work circles.\n\nRecently, she met my family for the first time at my uncle's wedding.

How do you think this is going to end if she values her privacy and you're \"not super comfortable\" giving her any?\n\nYTA.

I don\u2019t blame her for keeping all that quiet as not only might it put her job at risk, some people/family get jealous and resentful and might treat her shitty knowing what she makes.

She makes a request for a salary and they have every right and ability to say no! And like you say, everyone else is doing it. Why she\u2019s doing it is her own damn business, but that won\u2019t stop anyone from having feelings about it and using those feelings to judge her, just like his family. \n\nThis whole thing made me steaming mad.

Start ups would more likely move on as making money/gaining market share will lead to bonuses and buyouts as opposed to focusing on needless vindictive lawsuits against a former employee instead.", "A lot of start ups especially for tech have clauses that state anything you create or any code you write now belongs to them, even rewriting it at another company is intellectual property theft. Especially if it's government related.\n\nAnd while most would let it go, some CEO's do petty and vengeful shit that costs them tons of money, just so they can soothe their ego, which is also pretty common in tech.\n\nAnd no matter how likely it is it's still a possibility with severe consequences, if it wasn't why would she be keeping it a secret?"]}
