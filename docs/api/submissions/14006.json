She's honestly a shark with negotiations, and it's amazing. Like she can look a guy in the eyes with a straight face and tell him that 260k isn't a high enough salary. \n\nThen she donates every extra dollar she has to local food banks, bail bonds, to support tenants and workers unions, and mutual aid groups. And with the jobs she's getting, shes giving away 200 thousand dollars a year. It's still insane to me. \n\nShe's asked me to keep it quiet around town because she doesn't want it getting back to her work circles.\n\nRecently, she met my family for the first time at my uncle's wedding. When my family asked what she did, she said she was leading an engineering department at (startup) but she was job hunting at the moment because she didn't love it there. I joked that she never stops job hunting, as soon as she gets a job she's angling for a raise or promotion. And if it doesn't happen in a year or so, she's gone! \n\nShe laughed and said I was overselling it a bit, and I was like \"babe you just walked into the CEOs office this week threatening to quit if you didn't get a raise\" and she got kinda irritable.   \n\nLater that night, my brother, cousin, and dad were telling me how different she seems than what they expected - I'd said she was down to earth and chill and kind, and she was coming off kinda.. ruthless corporate type? And entitled.\n\nI told them that she asked me to keep this on the downlow but she gives most of that away. I said how her career goal is \"to exploit the corporations right back\" and she's taking all that money and giving back to the community.\n\nShe overheard me talking about this and pulled me aside, and she was angry I'd said so much. She said she'd be in deep shit at work if any of this got out. I said I didn't think it would be that big of a deal, it's normal to donate to charity. Plus I wanted my family to see her like I saw her. \n\nShe got upset and said it wasn't my business to share, and I don't understand what her field is like at all. \n\nI snapped at her and said it didn't have to be so secretive, and she got mad and said I didn't understand, and it was fucked up I told my family when she asked me to keep it quiet. \n\nAITA for telling my family?", "created_utc": 1680633432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bs5e3/aita_for_telling_my_family_my_girlfriends/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
