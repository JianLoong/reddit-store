Apparently our birthdays or SSNs were also quite similar. I'm glad I have a common name which is probably why the officer checked so closely. If it was a unique name assumptions may have been made. \ud83e\udd23", "I am happy :). I love life and am glad I remember that show.\nAge doesn't bother me at all. Thanks for the uplift!!!", "My father\u2019s 1st, 3rd and 4th wives all had the same name\u2026 and his 2nd and 6th were the same woman too\u2026", "My sister divorced one guy and married the second guy with the same first and last name lol", "Dude, my ex boyfriend had 3 ex-girlfriends with my same name lol! It was weird af. It's not even a common name!", "That was not by choice.  OP\u2019s father had input into the half-sister\u2019s name.", "Yeah it doesnt reduce the fathers assholeness, it just means his wife has achieved equivalency", "I assumed that\u2019s what they said based on the backlash", "Ok I missed on that, but the point still is the second kid didn\u2019t choose her life. It\u2019s totally Fed up that the dad did what he did, and I feel so awful for OP. But the half sister also did not chose to be in her situation either. She\u2019s just a kid who happens to have a terrible dad.", "It\u2019s you and /u/wwphildunphydo that decided the word is offensive. You are speaking for your own feelings rather than those of people actually affected by this. You\u2019re like white people who get offended at people dressing with ethnic clothing, calling it racial appropriation, while the actual people embrace it. It\u2019s your attitude and immediate assumption that the commenter is being derogatory or insulting by using a well known and well accepted term. Don\u2019t speak for others and stop getting offended for others. It\u2019s not groupthink, it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about YOU and YOUR ego, thinking you have a say in any of this. Unless you are a child of an affair, you have no right to speak and your opinion is invalid. Even then, you can only speak for yourself and your own identity and NOT for others. \n\nYou are downvoted for your ego. Not your opinion. Not your perspective. Your ego.", "\u2639\ufe0f\n\nETA: you are right I\u2019m just sad about it at the moment\u2026the truth will set me free but not before pissing me off, ugh", "Keep her first name and change her last name, maybe she can learn to not hate her own name. It\u2019s not her faults or the other child\u2019s the dad is an AH.", "If needed, I volunteer as tribute to carry out this sacred duty.", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "At least then he won\u2019t be able to have a third", "They all have nicknames.", "I suppose one could stuff some pie in a George Foreman grill.", "Sure it was by choice. FIL decided who he wanted to marry.", "The other woman is not a \"wife\".", "And hey, love your user name.", "Crap Bag", "And you have my axe!", "I'm going with the latter", "You can\u2019t help the names of who you fall in love with, but a baby\u2019s name is a choice.", "The two of you are group thinking each other in the most obviously ironic way I\u2019ve ever seen on Reddit. Literally justifying each others ego while being completely blind as to why every other human is downvoting you. It\u2019s not a redditor thing, behind every redditor is an actual human with real perspectives and guess what, we all think you two are ridiculously egotistical hence the downvotes.", "Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a"]}
