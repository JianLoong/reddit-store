(Well, no, they're made for fixing terrible beds in furnished rentals, but close enough.)

Not accommodating her is almost tending towards rude if it wasn\u2019t such a big ask. (One thought: can you buy a cheap mattress for her and store it somewhere else?). You need to force your husband to confront her about staying over so much if it bothers you (which it does). There\u2019s still a way to set boundaries while being courteous.
