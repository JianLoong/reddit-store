Often, he actually pursues something up to a point and then changes his mind. Two prime examples: he just HAD to have our daughter's ears pierced at 16 months (his culture), which is not easy after a year. I called many places before finding a piercing/tattoo shop that would do it. I made the appointment, he was okay with it the whole way, but suddenly like 2 hours before the appt time, he changed his mind. I told him that was super messed up and unfair to do them, but he insisted and even yelled at me over it. Then he blamed me for the shop not letting him make another appointment. Another incident happened a couple of weeks ago. He decided he wanted a stationary bike ASAP. We found one on Marketplace and I had plans to meet them. I cleared my day, and that seller cleared theirs. 15 minutes before time for me to leave, he tells me he's changed his mind. There are other examples but these two are the biggest in my mind. I work OT almost every week, he works FT but our schedules are different. Because I work nights, usually appointments, doctor visits, and such things fall to me. That's just how it works. But that can also often mean I might not actually enjoy a day off for weeks at a time, whereas he has every weekend off and he does things he enjoys with our daughter while I and working and sleeping.\n\nThis time, after living in our house for almost a year, he has suddenly decided that this week is the time we absolutely MUST have plastic sheeting laid in our crawlspace. The problem is that this week is when his mother is here from his home country, my parents are here from my home state, and our daughter turns 2. We have plans laid out and I am getting her birthday party ready. Without talking to me, he made 3 different appointments during the exact middle of the day on 3 separate days this week, which means I will be stuck at home all day (where we live, we have to take a ferryboat to go anywhere, so no reasonable chance of going out before or after the appointments. I told him this doesn't work for me to give up my days off this week to sit at home, especially when we had plans. Now he's upset and acting passive aggressive like I don't want to handle any responsibilities around the house. He asked his mom to just stay home to meet the contractors and told me to, \"just go do whatever you want\" in a huffy, clearly annoyed way. But that means his mom has to stay here, so I guess I'll end up staying anyway. I would be FINE with them on a different week or some other time, but this just wrecks my entire week, which was already planned. I don't think I'm wrong here, but he thinks I'm being ridiculous. I also think, because of his track record, that he's very likely to get all 3 estimates and do nothing with them. He could prove me wrong this time, maybe. AITA here? Or is it ridiculous to keep screwing with my time like this?

You do have control and access to your own money, don't you? And who cares what he wants? What about what you want? \n\nYour parents are here right now, so ask them for help. Ask them for help in leaving him. \n\nIf you need a sign to leave him: This is it. This is your sign.", "It reminds me more of when I'm manic. Making and cancelling appointments and wanting everything done right now...\n\nI'm not saying he's bipolar because there's no other sign of it in the post but that's just what it made me think of", "Still, it's his problem.\n\nWhen I had these impulses with like the crawl space, it was with cleaning, and I still listened to my Zoom lecture.\n\nThe bike and ear piercing don't fall into that. Those 2 examples are planning something and then *canceling* something on a whim.\n\nThis reads more like a power play than ADHD.", "Doesn\u2019t seem like ADHD to me (I have it) it sounds like there are issues and a professional should address them.", "It reads to me like his 'impulses' are also abuse, given that they actively prevent her from having relaxation and socialization time. He is sabotaging her life.", "I'm honestly not 100% sure.", "EXACTLY!!!! OP, you need to start planning your exit strategy. This is not healthy or right! You need to get you and your daughter out of there ASAP! JFC! He is totally controlling you! Please please please get you and your daughter away from him. HE WILL NEVER CHANGE!!!!!", "I didn't feel like having an even bigger fight and having him yell at me for wasting money.", "Yeah. I'm definitely getting bipolar vibes reading this.", "when my husband used to have these GREAT IDEAS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE NOW\" I learned to just say \"ooooh nice,  let me know when it's done!\" or \" hope that works out for you\"  or \"good luck!\" and then disengage. Pretty much all of them died in the water,  and i was a lot less stressed."]}
