Often, he actually pursues something up to a point and then changes his mind. Two prime examples: he just HAD to have our daughter's ears pierced at 16 months (his culture), which is not easy after a year. I called many places before finding a piercing/tattoo shop that would do it. I made the appointment, he was okay with it the whole way, but suddenly like 2 hours before the appt time, he changed his mind. I told him that was super messed up and unfair to do them, but he insisted and even yelled at me over it. Then he blamed me for the shop not letting him make another appointment. Another incident happened a couple of weeks ago. He decided he wanted a stationary bike ASAP. We found one on Marketplace and I had plans to meet them. I cleared my day, and that seller cleared theirs. 15 minutes before time for me to leave, he tells me he's changed his mind. There are other examples but these two are the biggest in my mind. I work OT almost every week, he works FT but our schedules are different. Because I work nights, usually appointments, doctor visits, and such things fall to me. That's just how it works. But that can also often mean I might not actually enjoy a day off for weeks at a time, whereas he has every weekend off and he does things he enjoys with our daughter while I and working and sleeping.\n\nThis time, after living in our house for almost a year, he has suddenly decided that this week is the time we absolutely MUST have plastic sheeting laid in our crawlspace. The problem is that this week is when his mother is here from his home country, my parents are here from my home state, and our daughter turns 2. We have plans laid out and I am getting her birthday party ready. Without talking to me, he made 3 different appointments during the exact middle of the day on 3 separate days this week, which means I will be stuck at home all day (where we live, we have to take a ferryboat to go anywhere, so no reasonable chance of going out before or after the appointments. I told him this doesn't work for me to give up my days off this week to sit at home, especially when we had plans. Now he's upset and acting passive aggressive like I don't want to handle any responsibilities around the house. He asked his mom to just stay home to meet the contractors and told me to, \"just go do whatever you want\" in a huffy, clearly annoyed way. But that means his mom has to stay here, so I guess I'll end up staying anyway. I would be FINE with them on a different week or some other time, but this just wrecks my entire week, which was already planned. I don't think I'm wrong here, but he thinks I'm being ridiculous. I also think, because of his track record, that he's very likely to get all 3 estimates and do nothing with them. He could prove me wrong this time, maybe. AITA here?

Your husband should never yell at you over anything unless it's some serious danger, like if you always leave the gas on while lighting candles. There is zero excuse for him to be yelling. Plenty of grown adults don't yell at each other, and that's what you and your child deserve.", "Yeah with ADHD I can see making appointments or starting new hobbies, but the cancelling if random stuff and getting mad at anyone who doesn't jump with it sounds more magic than anything else to me. Especially since he apparently isn't like this most of the time.", "Agreed - sounds very much like a friend of mine who is bipolar2", "Yeah now that I'm finally diagnosed and medicated I haven't had a full manic episode, but my partner is in charge of our money to make sure I don't do anything rash if it does happen.", "Yeah I just hope OP gets him help. The way he's acting isn't normal. Either he has a mental illness or he's being super controlling. Either way it's not good.", "As long as he doesn't max out your credit cards in the process.", "It\u2019s good when you finally get diagnosed! It took me such a long time to get there! I\u2019m glad you have ways of coping and handling things. I am the same, there are safeguards put in place otherwise I\u2019ll decide at 3am, to take up a new hobby and buy all the supplies!   \nI feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with the above poster, they need him to see a professional. Even if it\u2019s not bipolar, something is going on and they need strategies to minimise these events happening.", "Absolutely. Glad you have a good working plan sorted out.", "Yeah I wasn't diagnosed until my 30's, once I finally was we were finally able to get me in meds that worked! Before that anything I took had a good chance if making me worse rather than better.", "Me too! Diagnosed at 38. Problem was I was seeing my doctor during the depressive episodes, not the highs. The highs seemed to be a relief and seemed like a baseline, so no one was really concerned (My family, I mean). I was happy and not suicidal, so I must have been doing okay, right? The depressive episodes were when everyone worried. So many anti depressants I tried, none worked! It was all \u201cwe have to find the right combination\u201d. This went for years!   \n\n\nI have heard so many stories similar to this. It\u2019s such a hard diagnosis to pinpoint.", "Wow I really felt like I was alone in my experience! My partner actually figured it out first, otherwise who knows how long it could have taken!\n\nI'm glad you were able to get a diagnosis and get help. The disorder or l is really hard to live with, especially not knowing what's wrong!", "Yep.Glad they broke the cycle eventually. Mind you, manic feels fanrastic.  And I no longer launch into really nutty projects."]}
