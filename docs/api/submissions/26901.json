My wife got the worst of it because she struggled badly with eating certain foods and after several years of being berated over food, told she was behaving like a spoiled little brat and having food forced on her, she developed an eating disorder.\n\nAt the age of 17 she started seeking help on her own. At first it was just through her school counselor but then when she moved out and went to college, where we met, she started seeing a therapist who specialized in eating disorders and sensory feeding issues. She was also able to recognize because of therapy, that the reason she struggled to wear certain clothes was related to her SPD and was not her being \"weird\" about clothes.\n\nMy wife has educated herself a lot on food, childhood diet and how to healthily and joyfully introduce new foods to kids. She did this knowing she wanted kids.\n\nI gave my family a heads up the first time they were meeting my wife that her diet was not one they were used to and I said we could bring food if it were easier, which they said it would be for the first time.

I explained she is still working with her team and it's a day by day thing sometimes. One day they decided to make a meal where there wasn't a thing on the plate my wife could eat. They called her out for being rude and wasting food. I called them out for cooking a meal she couldn't eat when they told us we didn't need to bring anything for her. My sister also made a snarky comment about how colorful our daughters plate of food was.\n\nI spoke to my family and told them they had one more chance after that and they didn't listen.

It sounds like she has done an amazing job overcoming her disorders/conditions and is so cognizant of how not to perpetuate generational trauma. Also with you for seeing this situation clearly and supporting your wife.

Are you involved in these decisions?  Have you also talked about how to feed your children?

Does your wife discuss her feeding strategies with her therapist or the children\u2019s doctor?   You mention your wife\u2019s diet before kids and no one made a comment, because it was what was best for her.

I am not a medical professional nor have any knowledge of your wife\u2019s disease, but (not saying this is the case), and not sure how to word this, but I would hate to see your children have an eating disorder due to your wife\u2019s struggle with hers.
