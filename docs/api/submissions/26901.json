While I know your wife is trying to avoid the trauma she faced, you could give your kids other issues to overcome if they can\u2019t eat other places as you\u2019ve trained them that way. \n\nThey still shouldn\u2019t be commenting on your wife\u2019s food choices or deliberately serving things they know she doesn\u2019t eat while also telling you not to bring food. \n\nWithout knowing what you\u2019re doing with the kids at their house, it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s too much.  But accepting food as served is something good to work on (while still not forcing them to eat it, etc)", "Does your family only eat biege/brown food or something like that?", "Can't say I agree with your sister's take. Your wife is putting effort into her children's meals. What is \"doing too much\" in this context? Does she just resent that your mom didn't make her plates fun as a kid?", "That sounds awesome tbh", "At some point children will want to eat nothing but sweets or only french fries with ketchup. You will need to figure out what to do then, just like everyone else had to.", "I see, then why refuse to give your daughter what they were suggesting?", "They\u2019ll keep making something of your daughter\u2019s eating because nobody bothers to READ.", "That\u2019s fine but what I said still about ultimatums is true", "I see.

I used to love cranberry ginger ale before that, but a week straight of vomiting and begging for plain ginger ale has made it so that the smell and taste make me nauseous.", "My sons are both on the spectrum and both struggled greatly with food and different textures. Yet it was not just that, like if a teacher didn\u2019t do the thing they said they would that day they couldn\u2019t cope with the change. They would just go quiet at school but once home would fall apart and no matter what we did to try and defuse they would have to have a major blow out and that seemed to reset things. If they weren\u2019t feeling right that day or something little happened that\u2019s fully to do with their autism. Then they basically couldn\u2019t eat even though it\u2019s the very same thing they eat regularly, it wouldn\u2019t look right or taste right and it wasn\u2019t a choice they made. So many things and little things could trigger it.   \nThey are older now and at points if they are having a bad day they can still struggling thinking something tastes wrong. I did my best with doctors and dieticians to help give them healthy routine and relationship with food without making it a fight or a negative but my youngest still developed an eating disorder linked strongly to his emotions.   \nI told you this to try and explain about what your girlfriend struggles with and show it\u2019s out of her control. Heck it is frustrating and I had to cook for two kids like that which couldn\u2019t eat the same things as each other as they can\u2019t handle different textures to each other.   \nWe also used to have a problem with labels and sensory issue of clothes and shoes as they are all linked but now they don\u2019t have to wear school uniforms its far easier. Even bedding I have to buy extremely soft brushed cotton and wash it a set way so it\u2019s fluffy still when it goes on their bed.

I\u2019d love to look it up and learn about it.", "We are in fierce agreement. \ud83e\udd2d I think most (people? Americans?)  think of anorexia (eating disorders) as caused by nurture.  It's like fat people have no will power and depressed people just need to stop thinking that way, etc.  I think over the next decade science is going to find a far more complicated set up. For example, maybe you have genes that make your body over-store fat and then you had a mom who made you always be on a diet. Or you have genes that make vegetables taste bad and hard to digest and then you had parents who made you eat creamed spinach every day or some weird thing. Either one of those things could mess you up but both together and now you've got a complicated disorder that doesn't yield to trivializing. It's not just making stuff up or wanting to get attention or just not putting on your big girl panties. It's genes plus neural pathways plus bad habits. With maybe some non-diverse microbiome thrown in for good measure.", "That's why it's crazy to me when my parents say I should get off my anti-depressants since I've been on them so long. I've been depressed since puberty, I literally have an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and the antidepressants give me the right amount I need to be a productive human.

If they do our kids will eat it the way they plate it. But if they don't and my wife or I are helping we do try to make it fun for them still.\n\nIt's mostly just making the food into a smiley face or making a rainbow on a plate or some animal.

They're able to (and do) make stomach acid, but because they're in the wrong spot, they do so uncontrolled. Which then gets into my blood stream (where concentrated acid is very much not supposed to go) and threatens the pH buffer system in my blood. Occasionally, it breaks it, and I start going into what behaves a lot like metabolic acidosis (because the cause is technically different, I've been told it doesn't actually count as that, but the symptoms are the same and what happens is the same). It either resolves itself after ~12-18 hours of nonstop puking, or I wind up in the ER to get IV fluids and stronger antiemetics. \n\nOn a good day, I just have kinda a general, low grade background nausea (which is currently super fun, because I'm pregnant with severe morning sickness, so those two symptoms sets are GREAT at the same time lol) all the time. I can't eat large amounts of anything super acidic, or that has acidic metabolites, or that has acidic processing. I have to take antacid medicine daily to mitigate how much acid the stupid cells produce, which mostly helps. But it was really questionable late teen years until we figured out wtf was going on (pro tip, if you're a late teen female, presenting with persistent puking, you're gonna have to take a LOT of unnecessary pregnancy tests. A LOT.)\n\nOn a bad but not super bad day, I just can't eat, because I'm in the grey zone between \"ok\" and \"puke up everything\" and anything I eat WILL push me over the line. So those days, I just don't eat anything except like, baking soda (to try to neutralize stomach acid and help protect my esophagus if I do puke). On a really good day, you can't really tell anything is wrong with me at all. On a really bad day, I live in a bathroom or ER. Most of the time, I'm somewhere between good and bad. \n\n\nEdit because I hit post too early", ">genes that make vegetables taste bad\n\nI mean, cilantro and its close relatives all taste like soap to me.

And a variety of fruits and veggies is awesome! Training your kids so they\u2019ll only eat if you\u2019ve made an elaborate display out of their food?

I don\u2019t see what the big deal is. \n\nMost of the comments seemed to be focused on your kids but your family is just awful for purposely making a meal that your wife can\u2019t eat. It would be one thing if you and wife insisted on the meal being only things your wife will eat or that it has to be the same thing every time. But just making sure that there are a few things your wife can eat is just common courtesy, especially knowing your wife\u2019s history.
