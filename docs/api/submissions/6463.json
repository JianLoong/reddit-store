In the past few days it had been drama free, with some today.\n\nA few things to address,\n\n* To be honest I was pissed at my sisters rule. We had looked for a babysitter in the time we were informed no kids to when we said we weren't coming. All our usual baby sisters were going to the party (like our parents, Aunts), and no one outside that usual crew were available. Hence the last minute no\n* For those asking when I told her no to the dog coming over on Christmas. I told her the day before, because that is when she asked. This is her first year with the dog so I had no idea she had the expectation she would bring it. Apparently my mom told her to ask me first instead of just bringing it.\n* She lives 10 minutes away.\n* She's been vocal about not liking kids since she was a late teenager. She is child free by choice as far as I know.\n\nSo I got the drunk texts because family members were disappointed my kid wasn't there, especially the ones that don't see my son that often. My sister told them she was trying to have no kids at the party, they were surprised by that since my sister has never hosted a party where the kids of the family were not invited. One other family member that has kids ended up having one stay home with their kid. So my sister did communicate this to more than just me. Seems like others weren't happy with her decision.\n\nWe talked today and she is still mad about Christmas. Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family. I told her it can be family to you, but it isn't going to be family to me. It can be your everything, but it will never be to me. I told her my kid is more important than her dog. I'm not a dog person and will never be, and I just don't want it at my house. Apparently the attention my kid gets from family (including my mom) bothers her. It was clear from the beginning she wasn't going to be an involved aunt to my son (which makes me hurt and sad), but I didn't realize there was this much jealousy. I'm just going to give her space for a while then reach out.", "created_utc": 1672840678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1034ayq/update_aita_for_skipping_new_years_eve_at_my/", "score": 2535, "replies": [">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family.\n\nI find it really hard to process this.", "NTA\n\nThis comparison between a living human who has the capacity to understand they are not well liked  vs. a dog who licks it's own butt multiple times a day is wild.\n\nYou're right to take some space.  I would anticipate the eventual epiphany is not so much jealousy of your child but she's jealous of you.  Either way, space for you is good- but long term you might really want to think about how/if your child interacts with your sister.  Your sister will put the well being of her dog as the priority over your child, she's already made it clear that's her hill.", "A while back there was a post about a dog mom who wanted her friends to leave their children at home on mothers day to celebrate mothers day for her and her dog. I feel like she and your sister would make good friends.", "This really isn't about dog v. child.\n\nThis **IS** about your sister being jealous of you getting more attention. She sounds like she has been jealous of you a looooong time, and if you look back I am sure you could find more examples of this behavior.\n\nJust give her a lot of space, because she will forever be pushing her dog as \"*equivalent to nephew*\" and look at any talk otherwise to be an affront and insult.\n\nI'm sorry - but it sounds like you have other loving relatives in your son's life, and he doesn't need her unloving attitude around him. Good luck!", "Your sister needs therapy. You won't be able to reason with her on this.", "This is sad.   \nWife and I are childfree (in our early 40s) and are bigtime dog people, but we'd never expect family to treat our dogs as actual children and buy them gifts and just allow them in their home without asking first.  \n\nAnd while I'd love to live in a world where kids would not be at my home, 95% of my friends have them, and some are even pretty cool, so I learn to deal. (I have still never held a baby though! )\n\n  \nTo outright reject a child, especially a niece or nephew, is just cruel.", "Your sister doesnt seem secure/happy in her decision to be childfree. My BFF is childfree, I have kids, we get along just fine because she isnt jealous or mean about it. I respect her life decisions, she respects mine.", "You're still NTA, OP.\n\nHubs and I (just now hitting our 60's)are childfree. We are completely, unashamedly, head over heels for our dogs and cats.  However, we would NEVER assume/force/demand that anyone else pay them a darn bit of attention unless they wanted to. And we have large GSDs. When we have friends over the dogs are outside, unless the friends want to hang with them.\n\nI love my niblings and great niblings, but I'm happy to go see them and leave on my terms, no hard feelings with sis and BIL. \n\nYour sister is weird.", "Oh, goodness. I'm sorry you have to go through all of this. She still doesn't seem to understand the difference between a child and a dog. I hope she can come to understand, but man, that is super inconsiderate of her to make parents choose between her and their own kid(s). Messed up. I hope y'all get past this. \n\nJust like I said under the original post, you are NTA. She is. She needs to grow up and understand the effect this little bout of petty revenge can put a strain on relationships.", "The sad part for me is that your kid would probably love playing with the dog, and vice versa\n\nHope you are all able to work it out", "Wow damn. Your sister is just being overly dramatic.\nTrust me you did nothing wrong. I don't like kids to be honest. Never did. I love my peace and kids are Soo energetic and Soo much to handle in my opinion and personal experiences. I love animals in the other hand and I treat my dogs like my children but I know my limits. They are my family to me but they aren't my familys family and it's something normal and ok. I have nephews and I treat them well I tried to be nice and make them feel comfortable and happy but I don't want to be overly sweet or caring because then I will be misleading them thinking that I wanna be always with them I make boundaries that do not hurt them. I don't like children but your sister is just being a dick to be honest. A dog can be at home alone a kid can't. And kids need more attention and care than a dog Soo she can't expect you to not bring you child if it is a family event. In my opinion in the future you should be careful with your child around your sister if her behavior doesn't change when your child is a baby it will get worse and she will end up hurting his feelings. Just because she doesn't like children doesn't mean she has to treat them bad.", "I think she may not be childless by choice and that could be why she\u2019s jealous but that\u2019s a her problem not yours.", "You know, as the childless aunt ( wanted but couldn't have kids) I feel for your sister a bit and I wish you two could work it out.  Don't get me wrong.  She's being an AH. I feel a lot of pain and jealousy over my brother's 4 kids in my heart.  However, I love the heck out of them and I involve myself heavily in their lives. It's just that sometimes listening to my mother gush about her grand kids when I know I won't ever experience that affection toward my own baby hurts. The other day she said that she would probably never move away from my brother's to live closer to me even though she and I are close because they have the kids. It's something I have to deal with and I have the character needed to do so.  It is pretty obvious your sister lacks some graciousness in how she's handled it. I just don't think you really understand how the kind of attention the child bearing sibling gets can feel, even if she is childless by choice. I agree your sister needs therapy.\n\nI have a dog that I put a ton of affection and work into.  At one year old he is very close to taking his canine good citizen and he is the kind of well trained pet that doesn't create a problem in anyone's home. I have him trained to stick to a place out of the way if needed, not bark and he knows like 25 very cute tricks. This year we are going to my brother's for a late Christmas and I would have been very hurt and upset if they had said my dog couldn't come.  Nothing really to do with their kids as much as the joy and psychological comfort having him with me brings me.", "Thank you for the update!", "Does your mother spend more time and attention on you as a result of you having a child?", "What happens when she host the holiday and she has a dog. Would you still attend \ud83e\udd14 or put restrictions on the dog for you to attend? We have grown kids but we also have and had animals all their life's.", "Clearly she understands the difference because she wants a dog but not a child.  Perhaps asking her why she loves dogs but hates children would make her admit that there are differences.", "Its exactly this, kids have a place in society and are likely to be included in family events. She can play nice on holidays and special occasions", "I was going to say the same thing. Maybe she found out she had fertility issues early on and her choice of being child free younger became more permanent", "Ohhhhhh. I quite like that.", "I\u2019m staunchly childfree and I think your sister is being unreasonable. Even if you accepted that the dog is her family, and by extension kinda-sorta your family, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to allow the dog in your home.  I love my cat as I would love a child, and he\u2019s better cared for than many human children, but he is a cat. He is not a human child, which is kind of the point.  I pamper him in species-appropriate ways and I don\u2019t take him places where cats aren\u2019t welcome.  \n\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say the issue is probably more that she feels your family pays greater attention to you because you have children. That may be true, or she may just feel that it\u2019s true because of course family wants to visit and spend time with your kids. I\u2019ve noticed that a fair number of childfree folk are somehow unable to distinguish between time/money spent on their siblings\u2019 kids (who are separate people in their own right), and time/money spent on the siblings themselves.", ">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family\n\nDog people are so fucking weird lmao.", "I'd counsel you not to feel too sad about your sister being a distant aunt.\n\nShe's someone who acts out against an entire family - and buys a dog - because she is jealous of the attention you get.\n\nIt might be best for her to be involved at arm's length.", "NTA\n\nI don't like to lump people together but dog owners (and sometimes cat owners) can be so anti-child that it turns nasty and vindictive. Dog lovers and child lovers can exist in harmony, but some do not wish such a life sadly, or cannot look past their own ego and hubris and sense of 'right'.\n\nYour sister sounds like she might need some therapy. I treat my cats like my own babies, they're family to me, even if one right now is hours away with my mum and grandma, but I would never expect someone, even family, to view them as the same height as me. To me my cats are equivilent of children (though don't get me wrong, I do /want/ children some day) but I'd again never expect others to view them the same.   \n\n\nGetting jealous that your pet, no matter your love for them, is getting more attention or isn't allowed in someones house is slightly understandable, but the reaction from your sister afterwards is undeniably not. Dogs are messy and energetic and jump and bounce and if you're not all into dogs they can be overwhelming, especially if you're bringing one into your home for the first time. \n\nTLDR: Sister needs some inner reflection and I love my furbabies", "So while you were NTA I do really want to know why you are willing to die on this hill of not letting her dog come over.  You stated it is well trained.  Just because you aren\u2019t a dog person doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t let the dog come by once in awhile.  Did you have some trauma in the past with dogs?  If the dog was a therapy dog would you still object?  \n\nI feel like you both are just digging your heels in at this point.", "Why does this post just seem to be a good excuse to hate on people who are childfree and prefer animals? I'm a CF woman and have pets. I'm not jealous of my sisters who have kids and grandkids, and they also love animals and consider pets as family, including mine.", "So initially I wasn\u2019t going to call you an asshole and didn\u2019t call you an asshole in your original post BUT you are an asshole with the following statement \u201ca kid is more important than the dog\u201d and \u201cdog is not family\u201d. She can say the same about your kid. You have to recognize for some people their dog is family. And good luck having her in your life and treating you kid like family.\n\nMy family has both kids and dogs. We treat both as family, because at the end of the day all are living and breathing creatures. Yes you don\u2019t like dogs, but you sister doesn\u2019t like kids. To each their own. And I\u2019m not child-free and I still find your thought process disgusting.", "YTA. It might be difficult for you to understand that an animal can be family but to some people they are. My friend's best friend was a dog, he always came first. Your sister's dog seem to be important to her but you seem angry that she is not putting your kids first. Her dog is as important to her as your kids are to you. And no she does not need a therapist. You are the one who may need one as you seem quite resentful that she favours her dog over your kids.", "Wow - sounds like your sister needs to be centre of attention in the family. Leave her be with her dog. Sorry she\u2019s acting this way and jealous of your child", "I agree this is about a lot more than the dog or the kid. It seems like your sister has a lot she needs to work through regarding her own decision to be childfree. \n\nThat being said I honestly think it\u2019s fair for her to say no kids if you say no dogs. But I think she had no right to be upset when you opted not to attend. She also had the choice to stay home with her dog when you said no dogs. But the way you write about how you dislike dogs and don\u2019t want them around and that should be accepted - okay. That is exactly how I feel about kids. \n\nI don\u2019t think dogs or pets should get equal treatment as children and the expectation of gifts for a dog is crazy. But I feel like you are both feeling a certain entitlement that is not helpful. Children are not for everyone. Dogs are not for everyone.", "It\u2019s concerning she wants you to treat her dog as family when she doesn\u2019t treat your son as family. The same way you accepted your son isn\u2019t important to her, she needs to accept your dog is not important to you. Babies and dogs get attention, yes. But they should never be used as a source to fulfill selfishness, like getting attention from your parents. Her comments make me doubt her love and dedication to her dog. She didn\u2019t get her dog for the right reasons. If she wanted attention from her parents or felt jealous of your family, that\u2019s a conversation not an invite to buy a pet.", "So mystery solved: Sister got her way, so why was she pissed off? Because too many people at her party wanted to see her nibling. Young kids are new - like anything new, they're gonna temporarily be popular and a novelty and interesting like any other newcomer or big change in someone's life. People being interested in someone new is not equivalent to a slight against childfree people. She has a right to be annoyed, but she can't blame you for following the rule she imposed! If you'd shown up without the kid everyone wanted to see, it would have been the same result: her jealous of the attention a child gets. Now you can stop feeling guilty because there's nothing you can do to change her feelings other than go back in time and not have a child.", "Your sister is dramatic. I don't like kids all that much either (well young children like 2 and under) and if she simply doesn't want them in her house that would have been fine. But the fact she wants everyone to treat her dog like a human child is ridiculous", "I understand not wanting kids, I understand not wanting kids at certain events, I don\u2019t understand hating kids. People are children for a short time they grow and become teenagers and adults. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this will happen, but I can see OP\u2019s sister wondering why her teenaged/adult nephew doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her.", "Since her dog is her child, the dog should be excluded from the event as well.  Just tell her next time - no kid", "So....she hates kids but wants the 'clout' she feels being a parent gets?", "There was also a post about some guy whose wife was mad that he didn\u2019t do anything for her on Mother\u2019s Day. They had no kids, but but she felt that being a dog mom counted.", "Omg do you have a link?", "It\u2019s fine to be child free.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to be a dog person.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to treat your dog like they\u2019re your child.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT fine to treat some one else\u2019s child like a dog, or to expect others to treat your dog as well as or better than they treat their children.", "\nI don't envy my sisters who have kids and grandkids, and they also love animals and treat pets like my family.", "Yeah, I love dogs, but they\u2019re not the  same as children.

If someone is okay with it, cool beans. that's great, but it shouldn't be considered a given. \n\nAnd let's not muddy the waters with \"but what if it's for a disability, huh? what then?\" This is NOT about accommodating a health issue.", "Even well trained dogs can act up in new situations. Plus since  they don't have dogs his kid might not be used to them. Add in the over excitement that happens at holidays and there's a possibility of someone getting bit. I have both dogs and kids and love them all, but I've still seen a \"good dog\" bite my nephew's face so he needed stitches, and that was with four adults in the room. Shit happens, and if he doesn't want to risk that, especially on the holidays, he shouldn't have to. \n\nAlso, dog hair gets everywhere.", "Because it's her house?", "Why do you take her description of her sister's behavior as an attack on you?", "It's a post about frustration with pet parents who act as if everyone is obligated to treat their furbaby like a human child.

Your sister considers her dog her family,  you consider your sister family - people want to be with family on Christmas. Because the dog means nothing to you doesn't mean it should mean nothing to everyone else. And the whole \"my kid is more important than your dog\" argument is moot. This wasn't a question of her dog or your kid on Christmas.  It was just \"you can't bring your dog because I don't like them - even if you love it,  care for it,  have raised it alone and consider it family\".

As a dog owner,  you never assume you have the right to bring your pet to someone else's home without asking.  It's just rude, and everyone else's world doesn't need to revolve around her animal - just like her life doesn't need to revolve around her niblings.\n\nShe also sucks because,  although I personally have no problem with having child free parties for holidays that involve heavy drinking,  she only did that to be petty instead of having an actual conversation with you about why she was hurt.

You're asking for treatment you're unwilling to give. \n\nI don't think you really understand what it feels like to be diminished like that, and I think that is where her feelings are coming from, thus making her dig in her heels. Even at work childfree people are treated differently, and it gets really draining. \"Can I go home early? My kid needs \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" or \"I can't help you because my kid needs \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" \n\nShe's definitely acting out and digging her heels in, and I get that is frustrating.

Because right now, she's punishing someone who, even by HER logic, is guiltless.\n\nI think your giving her space is a good start, but this isn't something someone \"cools down\" from.

She could stand to be more welcoming, and she sounds a bit childish, but it\u2019s also not her kid, and not wanting kids at a New Year\u2019s party (something that famously takes place late a night, and often gets rowdy and adult), at her own home where she makes the rules, isn\u2019t by itself all that unreasonable.

I communicate all that with people but I NEVER expect anyone to bend to my choices and way of living. If someone has a child, it is wonderful for them and I don't resent them for it. It does not bother me when a kid gets attention from others - quite frankly I love it because there is less chance someone will pay any attention to me (I am a huge introvert). My life choices are mine and I have no right to force them onto anyone else. Frankly, I will also put a firm foot down when someone tries to force their life choices on me, but so far this has been an issue only once or twice. I don't throw temper tantrums because I \"don't get my way\" whatever that supposed to mean, like your sister does. She is jealous, she is entitled, she is immature, she thinks the world evolves around her, she is a child still herself. She has a lot of growing up still to do.\n\nMy dog also was my child and mattered more to me that other people's children. But again, that gave me no right to dismiss those kids or demand that others view my dog the way I viewed her. I did not like going anywhere without her (she eased my social anxiety) but I very well understood that there were situations where she just had to stay home. I miss her every day since she crossed the rainbow bridge. And I am also happy for every parent and family member that love to have kids around them. Whatever fills your cup...", "You seem like a reasonable dude who cares about your sister so I'm going to post this in the hopes that you read it, even though it will get downvoted all to hell.\n\nIs your sister being reasonable about her dog? Of course not. A dog is not a person. However. As a person who has a big family and does not have children, I just want to share where some of this might be coming from. When people grow up and have kids, many times the family begins to revolve around them. Every event has to be scheduled around their events or naptimes. Everything has to include them. Every meal has to consider their preferences. Every event has to accommodate their needs. Want to treat your folks to a fancy dinner to celebrate their anniversary? No, they want to go to Applebee's instead so the grandbabies can come. Want to have Christmas brunch? No, because the parents with little kids want to be home with their presents. Family vacation? We're all going to Disneyland! A beach vacation wouldn't be kid-friendly enough. \n\nIt can get even worse - childless and unmarried folks get accidentally left out of invitations. They're always supposed to travel to aww family, not the other way around, because it's too much hassle to pack up all the kids. Big life event? Sorry, can't make it because little Suzy has a piano recital. \n\nIs it possible your sister might be feeling some of this deprioritization, especially as it sounds like from your mom? Think really objectively about your family's patterns and how things have changed since kids came into the picture, and try to find some compassion for your sister's point of view. Her life choices are just as valid but are probably never celebrated or sometimes even accommodated. These are very common experiences among the childfree, especially if unmarried. They can sometimes be treated as less important and it hurts. Is your sister's reaction out of line? Sure. But see if you can see at least part of where she's coming from, and help make sure she isn't excluded from family life simply because she doesn't want to do absolutely everything with everyone's kids.", "You\u2019re respecting her apparent need to be distanced from your child but she\u2019s not giving you the same respect.

It\u2019s also not OOP\u2019s fault family members were not happy that the child was not present at the party, that\u2019s on the sister.", "I\u2019d much rather deal with my dog than your kid. \ud83d\ude02 But having said that, you\u2019re NTA.", "I love kids.

We have relatives that are scared of dogs. Despite my saying my kitten is my fur child, I don\u2019t expect to take my kitten everywhere. \n\nKids and pets are different. You can love your pet to death, and it becomes a part of your family and your life. But they are just not the same as a child. \n\nThe sister of this story, being jealous that her nibling is getting more attention than her dog, I think needs some therapy, to find out exactly why she\u2019s this upset over something that literally cannot be helped.

If so, it would be running all over the house, jumping on people, trying to take things off of the tree, ripping open presents, begging for food while under chairs, etc. I love dogs - we have 5 of them - but that is just too much trouble to watch out for during a party. Your sister was unreasonable to get upset when you said she couldn't bring it. Personally, I would accept the dog as family, but, good grief, we locked our dogs away from the hubbub for our Christmas celebration! It's too much stimulation for them.\n\nIt's sad that your sister doesn't want to be involved with the children of her siblings. Your sister could use professional help to assist her in resolving her Cruella de Ville feelings about kids.\n\nThe NYE party: Suprise! This is one of those things that 'they' never tell you about being a parent - sometimes you don't get to do what you want to do. Like it or not, the person hosting the party gets to set the rules. If she doesn't want kids there you find a sitter, find another party that does allow kids, or stay home. Whether she set the no-children rule just to get back at you for not allowing her dog or not, you were not singled out.

Why are you surprised she's not involved, you should probably get over it until your kid isn't a kid.", "Ultimately, the question was whether you were an AH for  skipping the party, as your sister sent you drunk angry texts and was upset that you did not attend.

Of course she does, but she\u2019s angry at you for skipping the party because you were unable to secure childcare. So essentially your sister expected you to leave your child unattended at home. Anybody who doesn\u2019t see that your sister is delusional is also delusional. A dog is not a child.", "Make sure she has her dog be the executor of her estate.  It's a lot of pressure on one's child but I know Fido will rise to the occasion.", "Im childfree by choice primarily but also health reasons. Ive 100% always had a dog growing up and consider myself a huge dog person. But a dog and a child are not the god damn same and Im really sick of pretending they are.

Child free means you don't want to have your own kids. It doesn't mean you get to ban all kids from your life. Being child free and expecting other people to keep their kids away, is like being vegan and expecting that people will never eat meat in front of you again, or getting mad that your neighbors barbecue.\n\nEven though I think her banning kids from her house is an asshole move, I do think that's her right. However I don't understand how she can do that and then get mad that you guys didn't come.", "Sheesh, of course your kid gets attention. It\u2019s a whole ass new person you created.

(And it's never just the kid, it's the parents, too.)  Because people have a bad tendency to focus on the child and parents, and only value that someone procreated.  Her own accomplishments will be diminished by \"little Johnny did this...   A promotion?  That's nice, and little Johnny did that.\"    \n\n\nYou also have an issue of your own:  You're hurt and sad that she isn't an involved aunt.  She's mad you won't acknowledge her dog the way she wants, you're mad she won't acknowledge your kid the way you want.  Sounds like you're cut from the same cloth.  \n\n\nAlso:  chill the heck out.  Your child is two.  You may well find that when your child is much older, she's a great aunt to him.  Because, I, too, hate kids.  I won't hurt them, but I will avoid them whenever possible.  I held my nephew once as a child, and that's because he was starting to fall down the stairs and I thought I should catch him.  \n\n\nGuess what?  At some point, he grew up enough to stop being a sticky, loud, annoying creature.  He grew up enough to have conversations beyond dinosaurs and pokemon.  At which point, I liked being around him and welcomed his presence at events, eating with him and his family, and even hanging out with just him playing video games.    Now, he's a full adult, and we get along great.  \n\n\nSo, maybe, you both bend a little?  You acknowledge how she feels about her dog, and she acknowledges how you feel about your kid.  Yes, to you, it's 'just a dog,' but you're going to get really good at playing pretend with your kid, so practice with your sister.  (And by playing pretend, I mean things like 'hiding that you really dislike the neighbor, because the kid will repeat to him the things you say, because that's what kids do.)", "How about you two just get along and accept that kids and dogs are just going to be a part of life and your son and your sister\u2019s dog are family and that\u2019s final. \n\nThe both of you are actually pretty annoying siblings. You don\u2019t like dogs so you won\u2019t refuse to let one on your YARD! WHERE SQUIRRELS AND BIRDS SHIT?! And then your sister is a jealous, crazy, son a gun and refuses to let kids into her home because she\u2019s not getting attention? Omg do you two need to grow up and be more accepting of each others lives and move on. \n\nNext time your family host parties, you let your sisters trained, dog child chill on your grass for a few hours.

In my experience trying to reason with a person that has dug in and is misplacing many of their insecurities on you, is not worth your breath. Agree to disagree and let it ride. Eventually, if you shut down the conversation each time she brings it up she will learn that you aren't taking the bait and joining her in her pity party to have her dog treated like a human by all. She needs to talk with a therapist about her jealousy over the attention your kid gets and her judgements about your choice to raise a family.

I can\u2019t tell you how many times family members have brought their dogs to family gatherings and it ends up being an absolute disaster. I DO realize that many dog owners are considerate and respectful with their pets but in my experience, that has been the minority.\n\nExamples: my nephew showed up at our house to chat for awhile and brought his enormous dog with him. We were visiting upstairs while his dog ran around all over our house. Nephew left. I start smelling something. I go downstairs and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say there were 2 huge piles of shit (nearly horse shit sized) on our downstairs carpet. It took me 2 hours to clean up the mess and it stunk for days. Then had to hire carpet cleaners because I couldn\u2019t get the stains or smell out without professional help.\n\nOver Thanksgiving another (different) nephew brought his dog to a family gathering at my elderly MIL\u2019s house. She is 87 and is very unsteady on her feet. Dog was tearing around because he was so worked up and my nephew could not get his dog under control. Nearly knocked my MIL over and kept running up to various family members and jumping all over them with his sharp nails scratching and clawing at people. Ugh!\n\nMany similar stories. Too many to share!\n\n\nI\u2019ll repeat that many dog owners are much better at being thoughtful with their pets. I\u2019ve always had pets throughout my life including both dogs and cats. I love animals and have a soft spot for them but I can totally understand not wanting other people\u2019s animals in your home.", "The sister acted like an AH, but he said the dog was well behaved and trained (just to clear up any confusion).", "I feel like this is just the normal sibling thing when one pisses the other off. \u201cYou said I can\u2019t use your skateboard so you can\u2019t use my playstation\u201d type of thing.", "You start with adults and work your way down to baby I guess.", "This was a 2 year old.  I don't think they can comprehend the loss.  Also kids are way more destructive then dogs.  I will never let a kid near my stuff.", "His sister clearly has issues she needs to address ASAP. \n\nI personally have been in child hating territory in the past. I'd say it was mostly a defense mechanism to all the people, who otherwise will push every woman in sight to get children. It's part of the stupid 'if you're not a mother you failed as a woman'-narrative. That's why I'm willing to give sister the benefit of the doubt and hope she'll come around and stop playing stupid jealousy games with OP.", "I don't like kids. I will always tolerate them, I will interact with them - because they freakin LOVE me for some weird reason, but I don't like them. I love dogs (I have four) and I take them everywhere they're allowed to be (\"bringfido .com is an amazing guide for dog friendly places) but I would never presume they were invited to other people's houses, nor would I retaliate by making people leave their kids at home during a family party.", "Personally I'm ok with being around small kids in limited doses and I think I actually want to adopt an older child or teen when I get a bit older, but for my teens and most of my early 20s being anywhere near the vicinity of young kids triggered the crap out of me. And I didn't know I had trauma so I couldn't articulate all the deeper reasons being around them made me so uncomfortable. I just knew I felt really on edge, unsafe, and defensive whenever they were near me, they over stimulated me with noises, they don't know it's rude not to stare, and adults always dismissed or shamed my discomfort around them so I felt like if I got stuck in the same room with one I basically wasn't allowed to have boundaries\n\nSo I don't recall exactly what sister did but I definitely recall thinking she crossed well into ah territory in this case. However, I believe in theory that if someone isn't comfortable spending prolonged time with kids in their home, which is their safe space, that doesn't automatically make them an asshole. Maybe not ideal as a host of family gatherings but if no one else has space and willingness to host and the no kids boundary is communicated when the invite is sent out, imo that's fine", "Who told you I was human? How\u2019d that get out?!", "If it goes so far that you\u2019re dressing them in human clothes, and feeding them a human diet that\u2019s harmful to their health, and trying to vicariously fulfill your prima ballerina dreams through doggy dance classes, then sure. \n\nBut doting on your pet: spending lots of time/money on them, reorganizing your life around pet friendly activities, living arrangements, etc, making friends with other dog owners and arranging play dates, focusing a lot of attention on good training, etc etc etc, and otherwise helping your pet live their best life and taking a lot of joy from their health and happiness, is definitely good for your pet. \n\nPet\u2019s can also live happy healthy lives with a lot less effort, but to each their own.", "Because human children have a more complex and nuanced experience of consciousness, greater depth and complexity of emotion and have longer memories. \n\nIf you tell a dog they\u2019re not invited to a party because auntie thinks they\u2019re smelly, the dog will not experience feelings of disappointment, rejection or negative self image. The dog will also not remember what you told them within a few minutes. A human child will.\n\nIf a dog receives a Christmas gift, it will likely make them happy. If they do not, they will not experience sadness or disappointment, because the dog is incapable of holding the expectation of a holiday gift. If a human child does not receive a gift from a close family member on a gift giving holiday they will feel disappointed and rejected, and the memory of those negative feelings may stay with them for years or even the rest of their life, negatively impacting future relationships. \n\nI could provide more examples, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re a troll and I\u2019m wasting my time lol.", "Or maybe it's because dogs are as not gross and needy as kids are", "But they aren't the same as kids. You're not a dog parent, you're a dog owner.", "The point they were making was simply adding onto mine :) They're just continuing/making conversation and an observation towards this specific convo and my reply. \n\nOf course its true for anything but we're not talking about anything we're talking about this specific event.", "I thought it was pretty clear that he was speaking for himself when he said the dog isn't as important than the child.\n\nIt doesn't matter anyway.  She asked him not to bring the kid to the party, he didn't bring the kid to the party.  What's the problem?  Why is she heaping abuse upon him for doing exactly what she asked?", "And you can have a video feed of your child sleeping in a crib. What\u2019s the issue? Is the issue that kids generally are more problematic than animals? Seems like the sister is on to something.", "Children are innocent, they shouldn't be judged by the sins of the human race. There are great humans and terrible humans, there are great dogs and terrible dogs. At the end of the day OP's child will grow to understand their aunt dislikes them and will be upset wondering why. The dog doesn't give a damn what op thinks and thus is completely different. Dogs aren't children.", "Yeah but she waited until the day before to say children weren\u2019t invited. Finding a babysitter on a holiday is hard enough, and she gave one day\u2019s notice. OP clarified in their post they weren\u2019t able to secure childcare so they didn\u2019t go to the party, and the sister was angry at OP for not attending the party. So essentially the sister is angry that OP didn\u2019t leave their child alone unattended.", "And OP isn't asking for it to be.  They stayed home.  The sister still got mad.", "By their age that should've been outgrown.", "Where I live, the time that you can leave a child alone under the age of 13 is based on location and reasonableness. So for a couple hours at 12 while you go to a store would be fine based on legal precedence but 30 minutes for a toddler would probably be illegal though I don't know if that has ever been litigated outside of locking them in a car.", ">The big thing people keep overlooking here is that you can leave a dog at home alone for several hours, but you can't leave a kid under the age of 10 home by themselves (probably higher than that, I don't know, I don't have kids).\n\n\u261d\ud83c\udffd**THIS**\u261d\ud83c\udffd is the comment I was looking for.  While we don't have any laws about what age can a child be left alone in Michigan but the CPS draws line at 10 and under.\n\nI love kids, dogs and cats but if your kid(s) have bad behaviors and won't mind, then that child/ren are NOT welcome unless you parent them because if you won't, I will and will turn around and parent the parent(s) too.  No animals of any kind are welcome in my house UNLESS they are a legitimate service animal (not emotional support animals).", "I\u2019m cf. And 95% of my close friends are, too, as well as my sibling. Not a child in sight, which is kind of a bummer actually. I want to hold a baby so bad and take a kid to the petting zoo (because it\u2019s weird when an adult goes alone). Just not enough to have one of my own. But, man, I need a mom friend STAT. And then I need her to drive us to the zoo.", "They may be a necessary part of society but you don't have to be around them if you don't want to, especially in your own home", "I was born fully grown thank you \ud83e\udd23", "I think it is wrong to compare it this way. If it was a very small baby (or severely handicapped baby) that did not have the same advanced depth or consciousness as an older baby, you would still want your family to include it in giving gifts and treat it with love as a family member. I\u2019m not saying that they should be treated as kids, but people should be aware that animals can be extremely important for a person. They can be as loved as much as a kid, or more. I would want my family to care about what is important to me, regardless of species or if it is really important to the dog. I got really happy when my mom got my dog a christmas gift, because it makes me happy to see him happy. Isn\u2019t that what you should want for your family?", "Ok but OP's sister literally text them (drunkenly) that it was bullshit she got their kid a gift and they got nothing for her dog. *She* made it transactional.", "I'm not talking about people who own dogs and don't want kids. I'm talking about the people who obsess over their dogs and treat them like children.  \n  \nAlso, from someone who has a kid and also had dogs, dogs are way grosser. Like, it's not even close. I had a golden as a kid and that dog left hair everywhere. He once found a dead bird in the back yard and rolled around on it. He smelled like a dead animal for weeks no matter how many times we washed him. He constantly had some amount of drool coming out if his mouth at all times. One time he had diarrhea and it freaked him out, so he ran around the back porch while pooping and got wet diarrhea everywhere. I had a friend with 2 dogs, and when one dog would poop, the other would follow behind and eat the poop. I had another friend who had a dog that would eat grass and then puke it up in their kitchen on a weekly basis.   \n  \nThe grossest thing my kid does is try to eat things off the floor.", "So do children. What\u2019s your point?", "Wasn't there a statistic that showed how you're twice as likely to be killed by another human than every combined?", "I meant emotional risk, sorry. Like, there's no risk the dog won't love you as long as you aren't beating or starving it.", "Idk what that had to do with what I said. I know they\u2019re not the same as kids. I wouldn\u2019t want a dog if they were the same as kids.", "Fun fact, dogs and children can be taught to head to the nearest exists when a fire alarm turns on!", "Correct. Dogs are better than children which is why I\u2019m confused about OP being taken aback by someone not wanting shitlings at their house.", "Everyone matures differently", "Right?? Holy moly\n\nI can't believe they were really about to host a while major celebration so this brat didn't feel excluded from *something she didn't want to be a part of* \n\nShe's clearly struggling with her hubby leaving but good god woman", "I mean\u2026. I have worked in the veterinary field for about 20 years, and I have a toddler. I compare my kid to animals all the time \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they\u2019re a lot more similar than most parents would like to believe. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, your aunt is actually trying to relate to you in the only way she can.", "Oh, how I wish I could be my dog.", "This. Dogs plus unfamiliar small children tends not to end great for the dog.", "I'm pretty sure if you advertise \"mom friend wanted\" you will be inundated with responses.", "My cousin is like you.  She does not want any children but she is all of our family's and family friends' children **favorite** Big Aunt (bio or not)/Cousin.  She goes all out with the kids, will volunteer to babysit two weekends a month so that couples/single parents can have a date night or a day to themselves.  One couple may have a Friday and the single parent may have the Saturday or visa versa but you gotta pick your kid(s) up at a certain time the next day or lose your privileges.  She said she is aware that she can handle kids two days a weekend but knows she couldn't be a good mother if she had to deal with a child/ren 24/7/365. I really respect that and wish that more people were honest with knowing that they shouldn't be a parent.", "I mean, no. You are wrong.", "Sure but doesn't mean a dog can't kill you.", "I often think how much easier it would be to be a dog. Acceptable to growl if you don't want someone near you, only go out to familiar places, and someone that feeds you so you don't have to worry about what to eat each day.", "I'm not \"generalising my experience\". It's part of dog psychology to always want to be with their pack. Some tolerate loneliness better than others. But it's not natural for any  of them. Don't humanise dogs.", "Me.

I will buy presents for people without being asked, but unless someone specifically says something like, my dog Fido should get Christmas presents too, I won't assume that I should purchase gifts for them. No one I know has ever bought a Christmas gift for anyone else's pets. It's also just very possible that we travel in very different circle, and of course as with all social norms it will vary widely depending on the group of people involved.", "No but it does mean dogs are statistically safer to be around.", "Again, not all dogs are the same. And random ass people at a party are not part of a dog's pack, that's not how packs work.\n\nI'm not humanizing dogs by saying not all dogs want to go to strangers.
