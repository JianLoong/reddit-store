In the past few days it had been drama free, with some today.\n\nA few things to address,\n\n* To be honest I was pissed at my sisters rule. We had looked for a babysitter in the time we were informed no kids to when we said we weren't coming. All our usual baby sisters were going to the party (like our parents, Aunts), and no one outside that usual crew were available. Hence the last minute no\n* For those asking when I told her no to the dog coming over on Christmas. I told her the day before, because that is when she asked. This is her first year with the dog so I had no idea she had the expectation she would bring it. Apparently my mom told her to ask me first instead of just bringing it.\n* She lives 10 minutes away.\n* She's been vocal about not liking kids since she was a late teenager. She is child free by choice as far as I know.\n\nSo I got the drunk texts because family members were disappointed my kid wasn't there, especially the ones that don't see my son that often. My sister told them she was trying to have no kids at the party, they were surprised by that since my sister has never hosted a party where the kids of the family were not invited. One other family member that has kids ended up having one stay home with their kid. So my sister did communicate this to more than just me. Seems like others weren't happy with her decision.\n\nWe talked today and she is still mad about Christmas. Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family. I told her it can be family to you, but it isn't going to be family to me. It can be your everything, but it will never be to me. I told her my kid is more important than her dog. I'm not a dog person and will never be, and I just don't want it at my house. Apparently the attention my kid gets from family (including my mom) bothers her. It was clear from the beginning she wasn't going to be an involved aunt to my son (which makes me hurt and sad), but I didn't realize there was this much jealousy. I'm just going to give her space for a while then reach out.", "created_utc": 1672840678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1034ayq/update_aita_for_skipping_new_years_eve_at_my/", "score": 923, "replies": [">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family.\n\nI find it really hard to process this.", "NTA\n\nThis comparison between a living human who has the capacity to understand they are not well liked  vs. a dog who licks it's own butt multiple times a day is wild.\n\nYou're right to take some space.  I would anticipate the eventual epiphany is not so much jealousy of your child but she's jealous of you.  Either way, space for you is good- but long term you might really want to think about how/if your child interacts with your sister.  Your sister will put the well being of her dog as the priority over your child, she's already made it clear that's her hill.", "A while back there was a post about a dog mom who wanted her friends to leave their children at home on mothers day to celebrate mothers day for her and her dog. I feel like she and your sister would make good friends.", "This really isn't about dog v. child.\n\nThis **IS** about your sister being jealous of you getting more attention. She sounds like she has been jealous of you a looooong time, and if you look back I am sure you could find more examples of this behavior.\n\nJust give her a lot of space, because she will forever be pushing her dog as \"*equivalent to nephew*\" and look at any talk otherwise to be an affront and insult.\n\nI'm sorry - but it sounds like you have other loving relatives in your son's life, and he doesn't need her unloving attitude around him. Good luck!", "Your sister needs therapy. You won't be able to reason with her on this.", "This is sad.   \nWife and I are childfree (in our early 40s) and are bigtime dog people, but we'd never expect family to treat our dogs as actual children and buy them gifts and just allow them in their home without asking first.  \n\nAnd while I'd love to live in a world where kids would not be at my home, 95% of my friends have them, and some are even pretty cool, so I learn to deal. (I have still never held a baby though! )\n\n  \nTo outright reject a child, especially a niece or nephew, is just cruel.", "Your sister doesnt seem secure/happy in her decision to be childfree. My BFF is childfree, I have kids, we get along just fine because she isnt jealous or mean about it. I respect her life decisions, she respects mine.", "You're still NTA, OP.\n\nHubs and I (just now hitting our 60's)are childfree. We are completely, unashamedly, head over heels for our dogs and cats.  However, we would NEVER assume/force/demand that anyone else pay them a darn bit of attention unless they wanted to. And we have large GSDs. When we have friends over they dogs are outside, unless the friends want to hang with them.\n\nI love my niblings and great niblings, but I'm happy to go see them and leave on my terms, no hard feelings with sis and BIL. \n\nYour sister is weird.", "Oh, goodness. I'm sorry you have to go through all of this. She still doesn't seem to understand the difference between a child and a dog. I hope she can come to understand, but man, that is super inconsiderate of her to make parents choose between her and their own kid(s). Messed up. I hope y'all get past this. \n\nJust like I said under the original post, you are NTA. She is. She needs to grow up and understand the effect this little bout of petty revenge can put a strain on relationships.", "The sad part for me is that your kid would probably love playing with the dog, and vice versa\n\nHope you are all able to work it out", "Wow damn. Your sister is just being overly dramatic.\nTrust me you did nothing wrong. I don't like kids to be honest. Never did. I love my peace and kids are Soo energetic and Soo much to handle in my opinion and personal experiences. I love animals in the other hand and I treat my dogs like my children but I know my limits. They are my family to me but they aren't my familys family and it's something normal and ok. I have nephews and I treat them well I tried to be nice and make them feel comfortable and happy but I don't want to be overly sweet or caring because then I will be misleading them thinking that I wanna be always with them I make boundaries that do not hurt them. I don't like children but your sister is just being a dick to be honest. A dog can be at home alone a kid can't. And kids need more attention and care than a dog Soo she can't expect you to not bring you child if it is a family event. In my opinion in the future you should be careful with your child around your sister if her behavior doesn't change when your child is a baby it will get worse and she will end up hurting his feelings. Just because she doesn't like children doesn't mean she has to treat them bad.", "I think she may not be childless by choice and that could be why she\u2019s jealous but that\u2019s a her problem not yours.", "You know, as the childless aunt ( wanted but couldn't have kids) I feel for your sister a bit and I wish you two could work it out.  Don't get me wrong.  She's being an AH. I feel a lot of pain and jealousy over my brother's 4 kids in my heart.  However, I love the heck out of them and I involve myself heavily in their lives. It's just that sometimes listening to my mother gush about her grand kids when I know I won't ever experience that affection toward my own baby hurts. The other day she said that she would probably never move away from my brother's to live closer to me even though she and I are close because they have the kids. It's something I have to deal with and I have the character needed to do so.  It is pretty obvious your sister lacks some graciousness in how she's handled it. I just don't think you really understand how the kind of attention the child bearing sibling gets can feel, even if she is childless by choice. I agree your sister needs therapy.\n\nI have a dog that I put a ton of affection and work into.  At one year old he is very close to taking his canine good citizen and he is the kind of well trained pet that doesn't create a problem in anyone's home. I have him trained to stick to a place out of the way if needed, not bark and he knows like 25 very cute tricks. This year we are going to my brother's for a late Christmas and I would have been very hurt and upset if they had said my dog couldn't come.  Nothing really to do with their kids as much as the joy and psychological comfort having him with me brings me.", "Thank you for the update!", "Does your mother spend more time and attention on you as a result of you having a child?", "What happens when she host the holiday and she has a dog. Would you still attend \ud83e\udd14 or put restrictions on the dog for you to attend? We have grown kids but we also have and had animals all their life's.", "Clearly she understands the difference because she wants a dog but not a child.  Perhaps asking her why she loves dogs but hates children would make her admit that there are differences.", "Its exactly this, kids have a place in society and are likely to be included in family events. She can play nice on holidays and special occasions", "I was going to say the same thing. Maybe she found out she had fertility issues early on and her choice of being child free younger became more permanent", "Ohhhhhh. I quite like that.", "I\u2019m staunchly childfree and I think your sister is being unreasonable. Even if you accepted that the dog is her family, and by extension kinda-sorta your family, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to allow the dog in your home.  I love my cat as I would love a child, and he\u2019s better cared for than many human children, but he is a cat. He is not a human child, which is kind of the point.  I pamper him in species-appropriate ways and I don\u2019t take him places where cats aren\u2019t welcome.  \n\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say the issue is probably more that she feels your family pays greater attention to you because you have children. That may be true, or she may just feel that it\u2019s true because of course family wants to visit and spend time with your kids. I\u2019ve noticed that a fair number of childfree folk are somehow unable to distinguish between time/money spent on their siblings\u2019 kids (who are separate people in their own right), and time/money spent on the siblings themselves.", ">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family\n\nDog people are so fucking weird lmao.", "I'd counsel you not to feel too sad about your sister being a distant aunt.\n\nShe's someone who acts out against an entire family - and buys a dog - because she is jealous of the attention you get.\n\nIt might be best for her to be involved at arm's length.", "NTA\n\nI don't like to lump people together but dog owners (and sometimes cat owners) can be so anti-child that it turns nasty and vindictive. Dog lovers and child lovers can exist in harmony, but some do not wish such a life sadly, or cannot look past their own ego and hubris and sense of 'right'.\n\nYour sister sounds like she might need some therapy. I treat my cats like my own babies, they're family to me, even if one right now is hours away with my mum and grandma, but I would never expect someone, even family, to view them as the same height as me. To me my cats are equivilent of children (though don't get me wrong, I do /want/ children some day) but I'd again never expect others to view them the same.   \n\n\nGetting jealous that your pet, no matter your love for them, is getting more attention or isn't allowed in someones house is slightly understandable, but the reaction from your sister afterwards is undeniably not. Dogs are messy and energetic and jump and bounce and if you're not all into dogs they can be overwhelming, especially if you're bringing one into your home for the first time. \n\nTLDR: Sister needs some inner reflection and I love my furbabies", "So while you were NTA I do really want to know why you are willing to die on this hill of not letting her dog come over.  You stated it is well trained.  Just because you aren\u2019t a dog person doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t let the dog come by once in awhile.  Did you have some trauma in the past with dogs?  If the dog was a therapy dog would you still object?  \n\nI feel like you both are just digging your heels in at this point.", "Why does this post just seem to be a good excuse to hate on people who are childfree and prefer animals? I'm a CF woman and have pets. I'm not jealous of my sisters who have kids and grandkids, and they also love animals and consider pets as family, including mine.", "So initially I wasn\u2019t going to call you an asshole and didn\u2019t call you an asshole in your original post BUT you are an asshole with the following statement \u201ca kid is more important than the dog\u201d and \u201cdog is not family\u201d. She can say the same about your kid. You have to recognize for some people their dog is family. And good luck having her in your life and treating you kid like family.\n\nMy family has both kids and dogs. We treat both as family, because at the end of the day all are living and breathing creatures. Yes you don\u2019t like dogs, but you sister doesn\u2019t like kids. To each their own. And I\u2019m not child-free and I still find your thought process disgusting.", "YTA. It might be difficult for you to understand that an animal can be family but to some people they are. My friend's best friend was a dog, he always came first. Your sister's dog seem to be important to her but you seem angry that she is not putting your kids first. Her dog is as important to her as your kids are to you. And no she does not need a therapist. You are the one who may need one as you seem quite resentful that she favours her dog over your kids.", "Wow - sounds like your sister needs to be centre of attention in the family. Leave her be with her dog. Sorry she\u2019s acting this way and jealous of your child", "I agree this is about a lot more than the dog or the kid. It seems like your sister has a lot she needs to work through regarding her own decision to be childfree. \n\nThat being said I honestly think it\u2019s fair for her to say no kids if you say no dogs. But I think she had no right to be upset when you opted not to attend. She also had the choice to stay home with her dog when you said no dogs. But the way you write about how you dislike dogs and don\u2019t want them around and that should be accepted - okay. That is exactly how I feel about kids. \n\nI don\u2019t think dogs or pets should get equal treatment as children and the expectation of gifts for a dog is crazy. But I feel like you are both feeling a certain entitlement that is not helpful. Children are not for everyone. Dogs are not for everyone.", "It\u2019s concerning she wants you to treat her dog as family when she doesn\u2019t treat your son as family. The same way you accepted your son isn\u2019t important to her, she needs to accept your dog is not important to you. Babies and dogs get attention, yes. But they should never be used as a source to fulfill selfishness, like getting attention from your parents. Her comments make me doubt her love and dedication to her dog. She didn\u2019t get her dog for the right reasons. If she wanted attention from her parents or felt jealous of your family, that\u2019s a conversation not an invite to buy a pet.", "So mystery solved: Sister got her way, so why was she pissed off? Because too many people at her party wanted to see her nibling. Young kids are new - like anything new, they're gonna temporarily be popular and a novelty and interesting like any other newcomer or big change in someone's life. People being interested in someone new is not equivalent to a slight against childfree people. She has a right to be annoyed, but she can't blame you for following the rule she imposed! If you'd shown up without the kid everyone wanted to see, it would have been the same result: her jealous of the attention a child gets. Now you can stop feeling guilty because there's nothing you can do to change her feelings other than go back in time and not have a child.", "Your sister is dramatic. I don't like kids all that much either (well young children like 2 and under) and if she simply doesn't want them in her house that would have been fine. But the fact she wants everyone to treat her dog like a human child is ridiculous", "I understand not wanting kids, I understand not wanting kids at certain events, I don\u2019t understand hating kids. People are children for a short time they grow and become teenagers and adults. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this will happen, but I can see OP\u2019s sister wondering why her teenaged/adult nephew doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her.", "Since her dog is her child, the dog should be excluded from the event as well.  Just tell her next time - no kid", "So....she hates kids but wants the 'clout' she feels being a parent gets?", "There was also a post about some guy whose wife was mad that he didn\u2019t do anything for her on Mother\u2019s Day. They had no kids, but but she felt that being a dog mom counted.", "Omg do you have a link?", "It\u2019s fine to be child free.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to be a dog person.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to treat your dog like they\u2019re your child.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT fine to treat some one else\u2019s child like a dog, or to expect others to treat your dog as well as or better than they treat their children.", "\nI don't envy my sisters who have kids and grandkids, and they also love animals and treat pets like my family.", "Yeah, I love dogs, but they\u2019re not the  same as children.

If you try that with a kid, you're going to probably wind up with police or CPS involved so there is a slight difference between them.", "Some people really do turn being childfree into a personality trait.", "I'm sorry, but dog owners are not entitled to cart their pets to everyone's homes. If someone is okay with it, cool beans. that's great, but it shouldn't be considered a given. \n\nAnd let's not muddy the waters with \"but what if it's for a disability, huh? what then?\" This is NOT about accommodating a health issue.", "Even well trained dogs can act up in new situations. Plus since  they don't have dogs his kid might not be used to them. Add in the over excitement that happens at holidays and there's a possibility of someone getting bit. I have both dogs and kids and love them all, but I've still seen a \"good dog\" bite my nephew's face so he needed stitches, and that was with four adults in the room. Shit happens, and if he doesn't want to risk that, especially on the holidays, he shouldn't have to. \n\nAlso, dog hair gets everywhere.", "Because it's her house?", "Why do you take her description of her sister's behavior as an attack on you?", "It's a post about frustration with pet parents who act as if everyone is obligated to treat their furbaby like a human child.

Your sister considers her dog her family,  you consider your sister family - people want to be with family on Christmas. Because the dog means nothing to you doesn't mean it should mean nothing to everyone else. And the whole \"my kid is more important than your dog\" argument is moot. This wasn't a question of her dog or your kid on Christmas.  It was just \"you can't bring your dog because I don't like them - even if you love it,  care for it,  have raised it alone and consider it family\". If your kid was allergic or terrified of dogs it would be one thing,  but this was a YOU choice. \n\nYou say the dog is well trained, there are no allergies to dogs in your home but you won't even let it stay in the yard if she picks up after it and it's not destructive?  Let's be honest - you drew the line in the sand here because you're offended that she's more attached to her dog than to your kids, and I think you know that. \n\nWhere she sucks is that she didn't confirm that her dog would be allowed to attend prior to the day before. As a dog owner,  you never assume you have the right to bring your pet to someone else's home without asking.  It's just rude, and everyone else's world doesn't need to revolve around her animal - just like her life doesn't need to revolve around her niblings.\n\nShe also sucks because,  although I personally have no problem with having child free parties for holidays that involve heavy drinking,  she only did that to be petty instead of having an actual conversation with you about why she was hurt.  Although judging from what you said to her in your update,  I'm beginning to understand why. \n\nThis is coming from a child free dog owner who is the proud and obsessive relative of two little niblings - you both need to get over it.

Your kid is more important to YOU, much like her dog is more important to her. To just blanket statement that is rude and diminishing. You're asking for treatment you're unwilling to give. \n\nI don't think you really understand what it feels like to be diminished like that, and I think that is where her feelings are coming from, thus making her dig in her heels. Even at work childfree people are treated differently, and it gets really draining. \"Can I go home early? My kid needs \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" or \"I can't help you because my kid needs \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" \n\nShe's definitely acting out and digging her heels in, and I get that is frustrating.

Because right now, she's punishing someone who, even by HER logic, is guiltless.\n\nI think your giving her space is a good start, but this isn't something someone \"cools down\" from.

She could stand to be more welcoming, and she sounds a bit childish, but it\u2019s also not her kid, and not wanting kids at a New Year\u2019s party (something that famously takes place late a night, and often gets rowdy and adult), at her own home where she makes the rules, isn\u2019t by itself all that unreasonable.

They are so cute.....so long as I don' t have to hear or smell or touch them - if i am visiting the dog's home, I am polite and engaging to the dog b/c IT'S HIS HOME, NOT MINE. I don't really want the in *my* home (although I'd take a dog in my house over a kid at a NYE party. kid over for brunch? sure. NYE party? Absolutely not). I'll allow a well-behaved dog over my house for short periods of time if it makes the life of my guest easier. (But no puppies or untrained dogs, and no overnights, and requests for such put me off a bit but i try to empathize with the reality that many dogs do well in a kennel not to mention the expense). I come from a family and friends network of child-free types so haven't had to deal too much with kids other than specifying that my NYE party was not kid-friendly. Stopped inviting those parents when they showed up **early** one year with kids in tow b/c \"its hard to find a sitter\".  Communication is key. FWIW, i think sister treating her dog akin to her niblings is insane. That being said, i'd cross oceans for my parakeet and think he's WAYYYYY cooler than any kid I've met lol. We all have our weird things.", "If you ask for something it isn\u2019t a gift it is charity. I don\u2019t ask for gifts for me or my dogs but my friends and family love me, know how I feel about my dogs and always buy something. My family doesn\u2019t ask me to buy gifts for them or their kids or pets, I just do. Do I spend more on humans, yes.", "It would honestly depend on the person and the pet. I have some family I don't like and I really love my pets. So in that scenario, I'd probably choose my pet/the animal. Animals are family to a lot of people. I am child free and have pets. My family (extended and nuclear) all love my animals. If I died tomorrow, they would make sure my animals were taken care of and safe (just like I would their kids).", "do you even hear yourself bro??", "If it's a life and death situation (unlikely, but not absurd), then the obvious choice is the kids over dogs. \n\nI'm commenting on accepting pets as family in a kind, loving environment. But perhaps next time I should make a ranked list of family so folks like you are satisfied. Heaven forbid I say \"my friends are family\", then I'd have to tell you where they stand next to my niece in order of rescue. Lol.", "It can be a multitude of things. It could be her realizing her child free life isn\u2019t going garner the same attention from parents as everyone else, it could fertility issues or it could just be plain jealousy. No one knows other than the sister what\u2019s true.", "I did, too!", "If you read the story the sister lives 10 minutes away. I love my fur baby to death but if a person wants a dog free visit they get one. \n\nWith the dog 10 minutes away she could literally go home once every 2-3 hours, let the dog out, and run back home to the Christmas gathering later", "According to OP, they did agree on that EXACT compromise, but she's not sticking to it.", "Dog lover and longtime dog owner.  I worked 8-10 hour shifts, 5 days a week  for 25 years.  Dogs were absolutely fine.", "So true! I love my pets, but (not to be morbid) someday when they're all up at the big farm in the sky, I just don't think I want anymore. We have 3 dogs and a cat because I'm a sucker for fur and big eyes, and my husband and kids really wanted them. But of course I'm the one home taking care of them all day. I think once these 4 are running around with furry Jeebus, I'm done with pets. If anything, I'm okay with getting a small dog that we can take everywhere (not possible now, with our 3 big mutts) and a breed that tends to live a long while.", "I\u2019m confused how OP is handling things in an exhausting way? She literally just didn\u2019t have a dog in her house. That\u2019s it. She wasn\u2019t petty. She didn\u2019t insult her sister. She tried to find a sitter. She tried to solve the conflict after the fact.", "\"Creating drama\"? Are you kidding? They don't want dogs in their house. That's perfectly reasonable, and they're not the only people who don't want dogs in their house.\n\nOn the other hand, sister doesn't mind kids in her house (she's had them before, numerous times) - she's just being petty.", "I\u2019ve never visited either subreddit as I find it weird when people end up as \u2018mombie\u2019 about not having kids or as evangelical about atheism as some religious people. I don\u2019t drive and to me that is like if I joined non drivers groups and made the absence of something or not choosing a different life choice my defining value instead of embracing the choices and values I do have.\n\nBaffling to me. The opposite of love isn\u2019t hate its indifference. I feel like I\u2019m in The Twilight Zone at times. I just talk about the weather as often as possible\u2026", "Fucking yes. I hate this. I've had bad experiences with dogs all my life (it's not fun growing up with untrained ones and spending your life in a toilet) and people still sometimes like to act like I'm a heartless psycho because I'm not fond of dogs. Sorry, no, they're not perfect and some of us have seen enough of the downsides of dogs to not think it's worth putting up with for the supposed good sides anymore.\n\n...Plus the draw seems to be \"unconditional love and loyalty\" which itself is creepy. Wanting a creature that will love you without you putting any effort in is weird.", "it was a joke, relax", "Yeah but this was first Christmas with dog so\u2026 *I* would need to be told. And then I would file it away and remember for next year without being told.", "Can you tell me what you find so objectionable about what I wrote?", "??? What a weirdly defensive comment - You said that accepting pets as family is easy and I was saying that simply **saying** they're family doesn't get at the issue of what rights or priorities that allots them, which is the crux of the issue OP is dealing with. I'm making it clear there's a distinction (that you point out yourself) between human \"family\" and pet \"family\" so calling them all 'family' isn't helpful here.", "I think you are delusional to think everyone should think like you and every burning building will have the same situation.\n\nIf the child is a baby, I\u2019ll pick up the child and the dog will follow me out.\n\nIf the child is able to walk, then I\u2019ll lead them both out of the building.\n\nAnd if both of them are unresponsive, then I\u2019m fucking screwed cause I\u2019ll be unresponsive as well since the damn building would have too much lack of oxygen that either way none of us would be able to make it out without the fire department.\n\nSo next time you want to put out a hypothetical situation, recognize that not every scenario is the same and you have assess based on the all you do rather than a high level understanding.", "I'm going to rescue the dog. At a certain point,  kids can rely on themselves. Dogs will never be able to do that. \n\nop is YTA for continually calling the dog \"it\" among other derogatory comments about the dog and sibling. We get it.  The world revolves around you. Just go NC and make everyone happier for it", "Exactly this. They're fine at home if you're a decent owner. I have 3 big dogs- a black Lab mix, a German shepherd mix, and a purebred blue tick hound. Dogs are just fine at home alone during an 8 hour day, IF:\n\n\u2022 they are properly trained (won't destroy your home/stuff or howl/bark repetitively)\n\u2022 given stimulation (toys, etc)\n\u2022 they were fed and let out to potty beforehand, and\n\u2022 they have access to clean water throughout the day\n\nIf you have one dog, or you know FOR SURE your multiple dogs aren't food aggressive, you can also leave out treats or hide them in their toys/bed to find. I also have cameras set up in my home and talk to them throughout the day if I'm gone.", "My dog personally can't handle that long without an accident. It's a bit different at my dad's house cause he has a dog door setup. We also only have the 1 dog so he doesn't have any socialization during that time otherwise. It's not a problem since we started WFH though", "There's a difference between \"dog\" (the person above you has one) and \"dogs\" (you have more than one). Two or more dogs provide companionship to each other. They don't get bored or feel alone. A solo dog can experience negative feelings being alone especially if they are accustomed to having someone around.\n\nThis doesn't happen for all dogs, of course, as some learn from a young age to expect to be alone (because of work, school etc). But some never get used to it.", "Obviously the dog is important to the sister. It doesn't seem to be rational and there seems to be some kind of underlying issue involved where the sister might be jealous of OP. OP could have relaxed the no dog rule for one day. Sure, I'll get downvoted for this because people here are pretty anal about principles but if my sibling was irrational attached to a pet and letting them bring the pet for one night would make them happy and keep the peace, I'd suck it up. Because being right isn't always more important than getting along. Obviously OP's sister is out of line, no need to argue about that. But the way she's acting really hints at some underlying issues and maybe Christmas is the time where you could be kind rather than right.", "Yeah, the sister is petty. I just think of my sister was irrationally attached to a ferret, I'd let her bring it on Christmas if that made her happy. It's pretty obvthe sister has some issues going on.", "I had an ex literally text me to get a dog when I said I was feeling sad... Thus I was quickly reminded why he is my ex and that I should probably stop texting him back", "Per the OP\u2019s original post, he states sister didn\u2019t see her dog as a pet but as her kid and he (critically) casts her as a dog mom, if he still didn\u2019t think a $5 toy was a good idea he is even worse than I originally thought.  Sister is far more obnoxious and in my opinion wrong in all the other disagreements but he knew or should have known to buy a gift and chose to be unkind.", "[deleted]", "Didn't realize OP was dealing with a life and death situation, instead of one that can be resolved with kindness and understanding on both sides. \n\nCalling them all family is exactly what would resolve the issue here. The need to place family in hierarchies is what's tearing them apart.", "The question is who would you rescue- implying they both need to be rescued. It\u2019s not delusional to think that people should prioritize their children over their pets, and if they can\u2019t then they shouldn\u2019t have kids.", "Thankful I'm not your kid, holy shit.", "The question implies they both are in a situation where they need to be rescued. If you can\u2019t pick your kids over your dog, then you shouldn\u2019t have kids.", "> But the way she's acting really hints at some underlying issues and maybe Christmas is the time where you could be kind rather than right.\n\nThin end of the wedge.  Next time it'll be \"But...! But...! But...!\" and every time after. \n\nYeah, she has issues all right.", "A ferret is way different then a dog. You can cage a ferret for a whole party and it will be happy and content. It\u2019s bad to bring your dog to someone else\u2019s party and keep it in a cage for the whole duration. If that dog goes into the house all that fur and stuff is there to stay. Not to mention anything else it might track in like bacteria, dirt, bugs. Bringing a dog into someone else\u2019s house when they don\u2019t want them in there is never a need.", "Good for you. But lots of people don't want a ferret/dog in their house. Don't want to deal with the smell, letting it outside or dealing with its waste inside and so forth. Not wanting a dog in your house is not comparable to not wanting children in there.", "Don't think you mean me - I was specifically arguing that there's a difference between pets and kids.", "No, OP is not dealing with a life and death situation. That example was provided, again, to show that merely calling pets \"family\" isn't the end of the discussion because there are clear scenarios where pets are deprioritized compared to humans.\n\nSo what would your suggestion be here, concretely? Not just abstractly saying that this can be resolved with kindness and understanding - what would you suggest be done in OPs scenario to resolve the situation?", "Again, my response will always be choosing the one who is more helpless in the scenario. \n\nI care about a life. You clearly only care about human lives, which in my opinion is disgusting.", "I treat my dog better than some people treat their kids. Want to be my dog instead?", "And I guess she should be forced to confront reality, put in her place and acknowledge how silly her feelings are because she\u2019s unreasonable and OP is right. Great family dynamics/s", "I genuinely wonder if this pet person vs. parent thing is so ingrained in peoples' minds that this is the only thing they take away from my comments. Minutely listing the pros and cons of pet vs. kid instead of just trying be a bit more accepting.", "Yeah, that's what's bothering me here. It's my house, I don't want a dog/kid/ferret/pet! No one wants to give an inch and acts on principle because it's my house, my rules. And in the end, the family's split up on Christmas because OP can't deal with a dog for one night and the sister pretends like she can't deal with kids for one night. Everyone's unhappy and fighting and all because no one's grown up enough to give in a little bit.", "O. Wrong comment.", "Easy, just scroll up to my first comment. Acknowledge that his sister sees her dog as family and show some interest. Ask that sister does the same for his child. Communication, y'all!\n\nThere's absolutely no need to rank family importance here. Family members care about what each other cares about, and as much as OP hates dogs, he can still be nice to his sister and ask her about her dog. They will find a balance if they can learn to care about one another.", "I mean just literally saying it\u2019s family because she cares about it helps. Maybe buy it a dogbone for Christmas. If you don\u2019t want it in your house let her know ahead of time and maybe offer a compromise like (if it\u2019s a safe environment) bring the dog, leave it in the car and take it for a walk as a family. All things that would take next to no effort that would make her feel better. She\u2019s being unreasonable but OP isn\u2019t helping.", "You are refusing to answer the question because you know your answer is awful. If both need to be rescued, do you chose your kid or your dog? \n\nIf one of your kids develops a severe dog allergy and can no longer safely be around them, do you choose your kids or your dog?\n\nIf you are going to choose your dog, then I feel awful for your kids.", "Definitely not. That's insane.", "She should not be allowed to bring the dog over.  The rest is superfluous but therapy might be very useful.", "There's no 'principle' here. They don't want dogs in their house. That is perfectly reasonable and a lot of people feel the same way. The sister is 100% to blame, and OP has done nothing at all wrong.\n\nDogs are not people.", "> Acknowledge that his sister sees her dog as family and show some interest.\n\nBut that's still way in the abstract - how does this resolve the issue where OP's sister wants the dog to be allowed into homes as a guest for parties like kids are? Are you suggesting that OP should invite the dog over for parties and give it gifts like OP's sister wants?", "Your debate style is really unpleasant and makes your stance seem laughable due to the rude way you communicate.", "And I feel awful for anyone in your life because you feel so entitled to control how an random stranger should feel and act that I can\u2019t image how you subject to your own family and friends.\n\nAnd I answered your question. You just didn\u2019t like the response because I rather save lives while you only care about human lives.", "I\u2019m just glad neither the sister, OP or apparently the majority of the commentators here are my siblings. Lots of pettiness, lack of empathy and unwillingness to compromise going around.", "I didn't say dogs are people. Everyone's making this about what's more important: a dog or a child. I saying if you can't go out of your comfort zone and relax your rules for one night then that's childish. Because you put being right above being with the people you supposedly care about.", "Buy a dog ball as a gift and offer to have an outing to the park together.
