In the past few days it had been drama free, with some today.\n\nA few things to address,\n\n* To be honest I was pissed at my sisters rule. We had looked for a babysitter in the time we were informed no kids to when we said we weren't coming. All our usual baby sisters were going to the party (like our parents, Aunts), and no one outside that usual crew were available. Hence the last minute no\n* For those asking when I told her no to the dog coming over on Christmas. I told her the day before, because that is when she asked. This is her first year with the dog so I had no idea she had the expectation she would bring it. Apparently my mom told her to ask me first instead of just bringing it.\n* She lives 10 minutes away.\n* She's been vocal about not liking kids since she was a late teenager. She is child free by choice as far as I know.\n\nSo I got the drunk texts because family members were disappointed my kid wasn't there, especially the ones that don't see my son that often. My sister told them she was trying to have no kids at the party, they were surprised by that since my sister has never hosted a party where the kids of the family were not invited. One other family member that has kids ended up having one stay home with their kid. So my sister did communicate this to more than just me. Seems like others weren't happy with her decision.\n\nWe talked today and she is still mad about Christmas. Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family. I told her it can be family to you, but it isn't going to be family to me. It can be your everything, but it will never be to me. I told her my kid is more important than her dog. I'm not a dog person and will never be, and I just don't want it at my house. Apparently the attention my kid gets from family (including my mom) bothers her. It was clear from the beginning she wasn't going to be an involved aunt to my son (which makes me hurt and sad), but I didn't realize there was this much jealousy. I'm just going to give her space for a while then reach out.", "created_utc": 1672840678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1034ayq/update_aita_for_skipping_new_years_eve_at_my/", "score": 282, "replies": [">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family.\n\nI find it really hard to process this.", "NTA\n\nThis comparison between a living human who has the capacity to understand they are not well liked  vs. a dog who licks it's own butt multiple times a day is wild.\n\nYou're right to take some space.  I would anticipate the eventual epiphany is not so much jealousy of your child but she's jealous of you.  Either way, space for you is good- but long term you might really want to think about how/if your child interacts with your sister.  Your sister will put the well being of her dog as the priority over your child, she's already made it clear that's her hill.", "A while back there was a post about a dog mom who wanted her friends to leave their children at home on mothers day to celebrate mothers day for her and her dog. I feel like she and your sister would make good friends.", "This really isn't about dog v. child.\n\nThis **IS** about your sister being jealous of you getting more attention. She sounds like she has been jealous of you a looooong time, and if you look back I am sure you could find more examples of this behavior.\n\nJust give her a lot of space, because she will forever be pushing her dog as \"*equivalent to nephew*\" and look at any talk otherwise to be an affront and insult.\n\nI'm sorry - but it sounds like you have other loving relatives in your son's life, and he doesn't need her unloving attitude around him. Good luck!", "Your sister needs therapy. You won't be able to reason with her on this.", "This is sad.   \nWife and I are childfree (in our early 40s) and are bigtime dog people, but we'd never expect family to treat our dogs as actual children and buy them gifts and just allow them in their home without asking first.  \n\nAnd while I'd love to live in a world where kids would not be at my home, 95% of my friends have them, and some are even pretty cool, so I learn to deal. (I have still never held a baby though! )\n\n  \nTo outright reject a child, especially a niece or nephew, is just cruel.", "Your sister doesnt seem secure/happy in her decision to be childfree. My BFF is childfree, I have kids, we get along just fine because she isnt jealous or mean about it. I respect her life decisions, she respects mine.", "You're still NTA, OP.\n\nHubs and I (just now hitting our 60's)are childfree. We are completely, unashamedly, head over heels for our dogs and cats.  However, we would NEVER assume/force/demand that anyone else pay them a darn bit of attention unless they wanted to. And we have large GSDs. When we have friends over they dogs are outside, unless the friends want to hang with them.\n\nI love my niblings and great niblings, but I'm happy to go see them and leave on my terms, no hard feelings with sis and BIL. \n\nYour sister is weird.", "Oh, goodness. I'm sorry you have to go through all of this. She still doesn't seem to understand the difference between a child and a dog. I hope she can come to understand, but man, that is super inconsiderate of her to make parents choose between her and their own kid(s). Messed up. I hope y'all get past this. \n\nJust like I said under the original post, you are NTA. She is. She needs to grow up and understand the effect this little bout of petty revenge can put a strain on relationships.", "The sad part for me is that your kid would probably love playing with the dog, and vice versa\n\nHope you are all able to work it out", "Wow damn. Your sister is just being overly dramatic.\nTrust me you did nothing wrong. I don't like kids to be honest. Never did. I love my peace and kids are Soo energetic and Soo much to handle in my opinion and personal experiences. I love animals in the other hand and I treat my dogs like my children but I know my limits. They are my family to me but they aren't my familys family and it's something normal and ok. I have nephews and I treat them well I tried to be nice and make them feel comfortable and happy but I don't want to be overly sweet or caring because then I will be misleading them thinking that I wanna be always with them I make boundaries that do not hurt them. I don't like children but your sister is just being a dick to be honest. A dog can be at home alone a kid can't. And kids need more attention and care than a dog Soo she can't expect you to not bring you child if it is a family event. In my opinion in the future you should be careful with your child around your sister if her behavior doesn't change when your child is a baby it will get worse and she will end up hurting his feelings. Just because she doesn't like children doesn't mean she has to treat them bad.", "I think she may not be childless by choice and that could be why she\u2019s jealous but that\u2019s a her problem not yours.", "You know, as the childless aunt ( wanted but couldn't have kids) I feel for your sister a bit and I wish you two could work it out.  Don't get me wrong.  She's being an AH. I feel a lot of pain and jealousy over my brother's 4 kids in my heart.  However, I love the heck out of them and I involve myself heavily in their lives. It's just that sometimes listening to my mother gush about her grand kids when I know I won't ever experience that affection toward my own baby hurts. The other day she said that she would probably never move away from my brother's to live closer to me even though she and I are close because they have the kids. It's something I have to deal with and I have the character needed to do so.  It is pretty obvious your sister lacks some graciousness in how she's handled it. I just don't think you really understand how the kind of attention the child bearing sibling gets can feel, even if she is childless by choice. I agree your sister needs therapy.\n\nI have a dog that I put a ton of affection and work into.  At one year old he is very close to taking his canine good citizen and he is the kind of well trained pet that doesn't create a problem in anyone's home. I have him trained to stick to a place out of the way if needed, not bark and he knows like 25 very cute tricks. This year we are going to my brother's for a late Christmas and I would have been very hurt and upset if they had said my dog couldn't come.  Nothing really to do with their kids as much as the joy and psychological comfort having him with me brings me.", "Thank you for the update!", "Does your mother spend more time and attention on you as a result of you having a child?", "What happens when she host the holiday and she has a dog. Would you still attend \ud83e\udd14 or put restrictions on the dog for you to attend? We have grown kids but we also have and had animals all their life's.", "Clearly she understands the difference because she wants a dog but not a child.  Perhaps asking her why she loves dogs but hates children would make her admit that there are differences.", "Its exactly this, kids have a place in society and are likely to be included in family events. She can play nice on holidays and special occasions", "I was going to say the same thing. Maybe she found out she had fertility issues early on and her choice of being child free younger became more permanent", "Ohhhhhh. I quite like that.", "I\u2019m staunchly childfree and I think your sister is being unreasonable. Even if you accepted that the dog is her family, and by extension kinda-sorta your family, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to allow the dog in your home.  I love my cat as I would love a child, and he\u2019s better cared for than many human children, but he is a cat. He is not a human child, which is kind of the point.  I pamper him in species-appropriate ways and I don\u2019t take him places where cats aren\u2019t welcome.  \n\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say the issue is probably more that she feels your family pays greater attention to you because you have children. That may be true, or she may just feel that it\u2019s true because of course family wants to visit and spend time with your kids. I\u2019ve noticed that a fair number of childfree folk are somehow unable to distinguish between time/money spent on their siblings\u2019 kids (who are separate people in their own right), and time/money spent on the siblings themselves.", ">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family\n\nDog people are so fucking weird lmao.", "I'd counsel you not to feel too sad about your sister being a distant aunt.\n\nShe's someone who acts out against an entire family - and buys a dog - because she is jealous of the attention you get.\n\nIt might be best for her to be involved at arm's length.", "NTA\n\nI don't like to lump people together but dog owners (and sometimes cat owners) can be so anti-child that it turns nasty and vindictive. Dog lovers and child lovers can exist in harmony, but some do not wish such a life sadly, or cannot look past their own ego and hubris and sense of 'right'.\n\nYour sister sounds like she might need some therapy. I treat my cats like my own babies, they're family to me, even if one right now is hours away with my mum and grandma, but I would never expect someone, even family, to view them as the same height as me. To me my cats are equivilent of children (though don't get me wrong, I do /want/ children some day) but I'd again never expect others to view them the same.   \n\n\nGetting jealous that your pet, no matter your love for them, is getting more attention or isn't allowed in someones house is slightly understandable, but the reaction from your sister afterwards is undeniably not. Dogs are messy and energetic and jump and bounce and if you're not all into dogs they can be overwhelming, especially if you're bringing one into your home for the first time. \n\nTLDR: Sister needs some inner reflection and I love my furbabies", "So while you were NTA I do really want to know why you are willing to die on this hill of not letting her dog come over.  You stated it is well trained.  Just because you aren\u2019t a dog person doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t let the dog come by once in awhile.  Did you have some trauma in the past with dogs?  If the dog was a therapy dog would you still object?  \n\nI feel like you both are just digging your heels in at this point.", "Why does this post just seem to be a good excuse to hate on people who are childfree and prefer animals? I'm a CF woman and have pets. I'm not jealous of my sisters who have kids and grandkids, and they also love animals and consider pets as family, including mine.", "So initially I wasn\u2019t going to call you an asshole and didn\u2019t call you an asshole in your original post BUT you are an asshole with the following statement \u201ca kid is more important than the dog\u201d and \u201cdog is not family\u201d. She can say the same about your kid. You have to recognize for some people their dog is family. And good luck having her in your life and treating you kid like family.\n\nMy family has both kids and dogs. We treat both as family, because at the end of the day all are living and breathing creatures. Yes you don\u2019t like dogs, but you sister doesn\u2019t like kids. To each their own. And I\u2019m not child-free and I still find your thought process disgusting.", "YTA. It might be difficult for you to understand that an animal can be family but to some people they are. My friend's best friend was a dog, he always came first. Your sister's dog seem to be important to her but you seem angry that she is not putting your kids first. Her dog is as important to her as your kids are to you. And no she does not need a therapist. You are the one who may need one as you seem quite resentful that she favours her dog over your kids.", "Wow - sounds like your sister needs to be centre of attention in the family. Leave her be with her dog. Sorry she\u2019s acting this way and jealous of your child", "I agree this is about a lot more than the dog or the kid. It seems like your sister has a lot she needs to work through regarding her own decision to be childfree. \n\nThat being said I honestly think it\u2019s fair for her to say no kids if you say no dogs. But I think she had no right to be upset when you opted not to attend. She also had the choice to stay home with her dog when you said no dogs. But the way you write about how you dislike dogs and don\u2019t want them around and that should be accepted - okay. That is exactly how I feel about kids. \n\nI don\u2019t think dogs or pets should get equal treatment as children and the expectation of gifts for a dog is crazy. But I feel like you are both feeling a certain entitlement that is not helpful. Children are not for everyone. Dogs are not for everyone.", "It\u2019s concerning she wants you to treat her dog as family when she doesn\u2019t treat your son as family. The same way you accepted your son isn\u2019t important to her, she needs to accept your dog is not important to you. Babies and dogs get attention, yes. But they should never be used as a source to fulfill selfishness, like getting attention from your parents. Her comments make me doubt her love and dedication to her dog. She didn\u2019t get her dog for the right reasons. If she wanted attention from her parents or felt jealous of your family, that\u2019s a conversation not an invite to buy a pet.", "So mystery solved: Sister got her way, so why was she pissed off? Because too many people at her party wanted to see her nibling. Young kids are new - like anything new, they're gonna temporarily be popular and a novelty and interesting like any other newcomer or big change in someone's life. People being interested in someone new is not equivalent to a slight against childfree people. She has a right to be annoyed, but she can't blame you for following the rule she imposed! If you'd shown up without the kid everyone wanted to see, it would have been the same result: her jealous of the attention a child gets. Now you can stop feeling guilty because there's nothing you can do to change her feelings other than go back in time and not have a child.", "Your sister is dramatic. I don't like kids all that much either and if she simply doesn't want them in her house that would have been fine. But the fact she wants everyone to treat her dog like a human child is ridiculous", "I understand not wanting kids, I understand not wanting kids at certain events, I don\u2019t understand hating kids. People are children for a short time they grow and become teenagers and adults. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this will happen, but I can see OP\u2019s sister wondering why her teenaged/adult nephew doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her.", "Since her dog is her child, the dog should be excluded from the event as well.  Just tell her next time - no kid", "So....she hates kids but wants the 'clout' she feels being a parent gets?", "There was also a post about some guy whose wife was mad that he didn\u2019t do anything for her on Mother\u2019s Day. They had no kids, but but she felt that being a dog mom counted.", "Omg do you have a link?", "It\u2019s fine to be child free.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to be a dog person.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to treat your dog like they\u2019re your child.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT fine to treat some one else\u2019s child like a dog, or to expect others to treat your dog as well as or better than they treat their children.", "\nI don't envy my sisters who have kids and grandkids, and they also love animals and treat pets like my family.", "Yeah, I love dogs, but they\u2019re not the  same as children. Especially family. I don\u2019t judge childfree people and totally get why people dote on their pets, but you can\u2019t expect other people to treat them the same.\n\nThe idea of the family accepting a pet on the same level as a OP\u2019s kids is delusional and selfish.", "[deleted]", "My whole family accepts all children and pets as family. I don't get why this is so hard in a loving family (except for allergies, and I don't feel the need to bring my dog everywhere anyway).", "Dog people are the worst but then again so are parents. All I know is I'm glad I don't have to spend any time with this family lol", "I know some other people who think dogs and kids should be on the same level. I currently have both and my argument is that when you're running to the store, you can put the dog in a crate and leave for a bit. If you try that with a kid, you're going to probably wind up with police or CPS involved so there is a slight difference between them.", "Some people really do turn being childfree into a personality trait.", "I'm sorry, but dog owners are not entitled to cart their pets to everyone's homes. If someone is okay with it, cool beans. that's great, but it shouldn't be considered a given. \n\nAnd let's not muddy the waters with \"but what if it's for a disability, huh? what then?\" This is NOT about accommodating a health issue.", "Even well trained dogs can act up in new situations. Plus since  they don't have dogs his kid might not be used to them. Add in the over excitement that happens at holidays and there's a possibility of someone getting bit. I have both dogs and kids and love them all, but I've still seen a \"good dog\" bite my nephew's face so he needed stitches, and that was with four adults in the room. Shit happens, and if he doesn't want to risk that, especially on the holidays, he shouldn't have to. \n\nAlso, dog hair gets everywhere.", "Because it's her house?", "Why do you take her description of her sister's behavior as an attack on you?", "It's a post about frustration with pet parents who act as if everyone is obligated to treat their furbaby like a human child. As a cat mom, I find this unreasonable.", "How do your kids feel about being placed on the same level of importance as your dogs?", "Lol, first of all the question of whether op is an AH was anyway well settled in the first post.\n\nAnd second no one is required to invite your pets to their events and buy them presents. I love dogs and have no kids but that is a bizarre ask to make.", "OP didn't want the dog at her own house, I don't think OP minds if the dog is around at other peoples houses", "NTA Loved this,you are a true legend.", "Here you go :)\n\n[Update with link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uxkp5n/update_aita_telling_our_friend_only_real_moms_got/)", "YUP.
