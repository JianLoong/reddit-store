In the past few days it had been drama free, with some today.\n\nA few things to address,\n\n* To be honest I was pissed at my sisters rule. We had looked for a babysitter in the time we were informed no kids to when we said we weren't coming. All our usual baby sisters were going to the party (like our parents, Aunts), and no one outside that usual crew were available. Hence the last minute no\n* For those asking when I told her no to the dog coming over on Christmas. I told her the day before, because that is when she asked. This is her first year with the dog so I had no idea she had the expectation she would bring it. Apparently my mom told her to ask me first instead of just bringing it.\n* She lives 10 minutes away.\n* She's been vocal about not liking kids since she was a late teenager. She is child free by choice as far as I know.\n\nSo I got the drunk texts because family members were disappointed my kid wasn't there, especially the ones that don't see my son that often. My sister told them she was trying to have no kids at the party, they were surprised by that since my sister has never hosted a party where the kids of the family were not invited. One other family member that has kids ended up having one stay home with their kid. So my sister did communicate this to more than just me. Seems like others weren't happy with her decision.\n\nWe talked today and she is still mad about Christmas. Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family. I told her it can be family to you, but it isn't going to be family to me. It can be your everything, but it will never be to me. I told her my kid is more important than her dog. I'm not a dog person and will never be, and I just don't want it at my house. Apparently the attention my kid gets from family (including my mom) bothers her. It was clear from the beginning she wasn't going to be an involved aunt to my son (which makes me hurt and sad), but I didn't realize there was this much jealousy. I'm just going to give her space for a while then reach out.", "created_utc": 1672840678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1034ayq/update_aita_for_skipping_new_years_eve_at_my/", "score": 35, "replies": [">Told me she wants me to accept her dog as family.\n\nI find it really hard to process this.", "NTA\n\nThis comparison between a living human who has the capacity to understand they are not well liked  vs. a dog who licks it's own butt multiple times a day is wild.\n\nYou're right to take some space.  I would anticipate the eventual epiphany is not so much jealousy of your child but she's jealous of you.  Either way, space for you is good- but long term you might really want to think about how/if your child interacts with your sister.  Your sister will put the well being of her dog as the priority over your child, she's already made it clear that's her hill.", "A while back there was a post about a dog mom who wanted her friends to leave their children at home on mothers day to celebrate mothers day for her and her dog. I feel like she and your sister would make good friends.", "This really isn't about dog v. child.\n\nThis **IS** about your sister being jealous of you getting more attention. She sounds like she has been jealous of you a looooong time, and if you look back I am sure you could find more examples of this behavior.\n\nJust give her a lot of space, because she will forever be pushing her dog as \"*equivalent to nephew*\" and look at any talk otherwise to be an affront and insult.\n\nI'm sorry - but it sounds like you have other loving relatives in your son's life, and he doesn't need her unloving attitude around him. Good luck!", "Your sister needs therapy. You won't be able to reason with her on this.", "This is sad.   \nWife and I are childfree (in our early 40s) and are bigtime dog people, but we'd never expect family to treat our dogs as actual children and buy them gifts and just allow them in their home without asking first.  \n\nAnd while I'd love to live in a world where kids would not be at my home, 95% of my friends have them, and some are even pretty cool, so I learn to deal. (I have still never held a baby though! )\n\n  \nTo outright reject a child, especially a niece or nephew, is just cruel.", "Your sister doesnt seem secure/happy in her decision to be childfree. My BFF is childfree, I have kids, we get along just fine because she isnt jealous or mean about it. I respect her life decisions, she respects mine.", "You're still NTA, OP.\n\nHubs and I (just now hitting our 60's)are childfree. We are completely, unashamedly, head over heels for our dogs and cats.  However, we would NEVER assume/force/demand that anyone else pay them a darn bit of attention unless they wanted to. And we have large GSDs. When we have friends over they dogs are outside, unless the friends want to hang with them.\n\nI love my niblings and great niblings, but I'm happy to go see them and leave on my terms, no hard feelings with sis and BIL. \n\nYour sister is weird.", "Oh, goodness. I'm sorry you have to go through all of this. She still doesn't seem to understand the difference between a child and a dog. I hope she can come to understand, but man, that is super inconsiderate of her to make parents choose between her and their own kid(s). Messed up. I hope y'all get past this. \n\nJust like I said under the original post, you are NTA. She is. She needs to grow up and understand the effect this little bout of petty revenge can put a strain on relationships.", "The sad part for me is that your kid would probably love playing with the dog, and vice versa\n\nHope you are all able to work it out", "Wow damn. Your sister is just being overly dramatic.\nTrust me you did nothing wrong. I don't like kids to be honest. Never did. I love my peace and kids are Soo energetic and Soo much to handle in my opinion and personal experiences. I love animals in the other hand and I treat my dogs like my children but I know my limits. They are my family to me but they aren't my familys family and it's something normal and ok. I have nephews and I treat them well I tried to be nice and make them feel comfortable and happy but I don't want to be overly sweet or caring because then I will be misleading them thinking that I wanna be always with them I make boundaries that do not hurt them. I don't like children but your sister is just being a dick to be honest. A dog can be at home alone a kid can't. And kids need more attention and care than a dog Soo she can't expect you to not bring you child if it is a family event. In my opinion in the future you should be careful with your child around your sister if her behavior doesn't change when your child is a baby it will get worse and she will end up hurting his feelings. Just because she doesn't like children doesn't mean she has to treat them bad.", "I think she may not be childless by choice and that could be why she\u2019s jealous but that\u2019s a her problem not yours.", "You know, as the childless aunt ( wanted but couldn't have kids) I feel for your sister a bit and I wish you two could work it out.  Don't get me wrong.  She's being an AH. I feel a lot of pain and jealousy over my brother's 4 kids in my heart.  However, I love the heck out of them and I involve myself heavily in their lives. It's just that sometimes listening to my mother gush about her grand kids when I know I won't ever experience that affection toward my own baby hurts. The other day she said that she would probably never move away from my brother's to live closer to me even though she and I are close because they have the kids. It's something I have to deal with and I have the character needed to do so.  It is pretty obvious your sister lacks some graciousness in how she's handled it. I just don't think you really understand how the kind of attention the child bearing sibling gets can feel, even if she is childless by choice. I agree your sister needs therapy.\n\nI have a dog that I put a ton of affection and work into.  At one year old he is very close to taking his canine good citizen and he is the kind of well trained pet that doesn't create a problem in anyone's home. I have him trained to stick to a place out of the way if needed, not bark and he knows like 25 very cute tricks. This year we are going to my brother's for a late Christmas and I would have been very hurt and upset if they had said my dog couldn't come.  Nothing really to do with their kids as much as the joy and psychological comfort having him with me brings me.", "Thank you for the update!", "Does your mother spend more time and attention on you as a result of you having a child?", "What happens when she host the holiday and she has a dog. Would you still attend \ud83e\udd14 or put restrictions on the dog for you to attend? We have grown kids but we also have and had animals all their life's.", "Clearly she understands the difference because she wants a dog but not a child.  Perhaps asking her why she loves dogs but hates children would make her admit that there are differences.", "Its exactly this, kids have a place in society and are likely to be included in family events. She can play nice on holidays and special occasions", "I was going to say the same thing. Maybe she found out she had fertility issues early on and her choice of being child free younger became more permanent", "Ohhhhhh. I quite like that."]}
