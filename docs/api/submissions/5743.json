You don\u2019t buy someone services from a sex worker unless you are 100% certain they will be enthusiastically received.

Maybe you had good intentions and thought that her friend might be able to reach out to her and \"help\", but that wasn't your choice to make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>AITA for telling my daughter about this situation?\n\nYTA. I understand why you told her but, as per above, she did not need to know and of course she's upset that you told her. It was never any of her business, and there was no need to tell her the details. It would have been enough to let her know that her uncle is *a bit of a creep*, if that is the part you wanted her to be aware of, and then elaborate if she asks to know more.\n\n Even then, you shouldn't have outed her friend in the process.", "If you were just venting to your daughter about a strange situation, NTA.\n\nIf you were trying to out her friend, YTA, but still, points for not sleeping with her.", "NTA\n\n\nI\u2019m guessing you told your daughter to make sure the story didn\u2019t get twisted to paint you as the creepy old man that tried to hire his daughter\u2019s childhood friend for some \u201cadult fun\u201d.", "NTA.

Why tell your daughter?", "NTA", "NTA.  If you don't want people finding out you're a prostitute, don't be one.  If you don't want people finding out you hired a prostitute, don't hire one.  To say prostitutes and their clients need their privacy respected is ridiculous, we aren't talking about patient confidentiality here.", "That is debatable. He's her dad, and choosing to keep secrets like this is the whole road, not just one time thing. If they're managed to maintain 'no secrets'-line, was this some hill one should die on? She was ready for sex after recognition, which implies she wasn't worried about her profession would be revealed to his daughter. He didn't have sex with her. Seems to me that since there's a boomer aged man and some young women involved, the man just has to be TA. \n\nNTA, as he acted like a gentleman. He chose not to keep secrets from his daughter, can he be blamed? I don't think so.", "what did OP do? it's not like he was shaming her for it", "You wouldn't think of it, but for my husband's 60th b-day a female friend of mine offered to hire us either a male or female worker for a night, because my husband should live it up, and we'd both love it.

She was a bit disappointed, but understood and we had a very nice dinner with her instead.\n\nNo shame to anyone, though!
