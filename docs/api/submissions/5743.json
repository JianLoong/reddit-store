My daughter (23F) is living in Europe so I wasn't going to see her either. My plan was to stay at an hungarian bar that I knew would be open all night drinking wine. I was the only costumer for the most part and I was feeling strangely calm, almost in peace.\n\nMy brother was texting me during the night to see how I was. He asked me in which bar I was and told me to send him a selfie. I was drinking there alone when this girl walked towards my direction and sat next to me. I recognized her immediately as a friend of my daughter when they were both in high school (23F).\n\nShe explained to me that my brother had hired her a few days ago to buy her services for me during Christmas and he had sent her my location, as well as a description of what I was wearing so she could find me. My brother didn't knew about her previous connection with me or my daughter and she didn't recognized me until she saw my face up-close. She was still open to have sex with me after realising who I was but I told her no. I offered to take her home but she refused to let me do that, even after I insisted.\n\nWhen my daughter called me the next day, I told her this whole story and she got angry because she says she didn't want to have all that information and that I shouldn't tell anyone about what that girl was doing to respect her privacy. My brother is also mad at me for telling my daughter because he thinks she will now think poorly of him for hiring a prostitute.

There\u2019s nothing wrong up until the point you needlessly got your daughter involved. She didn\u2019t need to know that.

Don't out sex workers!", "YTA", "YTA for telling your daughter. She didn't need to know ANY of it. Your daughter is right, you shouldn't be passing it around either.\n\nNothing wrong with hiring an escort IF legal in your area. Just keep it private.", "YTA for outing a sex worker", "This is wrong on so many levels", "YTA. I assume you and your brother will find another poor woman to exploit.", "Was it necessary to share this with your daughter?", "This answer! Probably shouldn\u2019t have been shared lol but I could see OP thinking his* daughter might know about her friend, and was worried her friend might share it with his daughter. Maybe he just wanted to get ahead of it in case", "Yup. This is it.", "People may accuse him of doing something to the girl and twist the story to say he approached her. what if her friend did that? Do you expect him to lay down and just accept it? yeah it's better safe than sorry", "Not the daughter and her friend tho.", "Maybe that's the kind of thing a young woman needs to know about her uncle.\n\nNTA If your brother and her friend truly believe what they each did/are doing is okay, they have no reason to keep it a secret.", "Interesting take. Are you against sex work entirely, or do you just feel people should only hire sex workers that are close to their own age?", "Not as sad as his brother", "Totally agree. \n\nLike, what if she texted daughter that \"guess who tried to hire me tonight?\"", "True. I guess I should've made that clear.", "I think the sex industry is exploitative overall. I don't agree that consent can or should be bought. But is it particularly gross to see old men using young women this way? Yep.", "Yeah that can totally happen. Anyway his daughter seems like the decent sort who won't spread it around."]}
