Your sister needs some serious counseling and grief therapy. You all can have empathy for her in general, without the extremes of birthday and sympathy cards x5 every year forever. And while a MC is terrible it\u2019s not the same as losing a child to SIDS and she needs to stop being so self centered that she would somehow make that tragedy about herself.", "NTA. Your sister does not need Christmas cards or Memorial cards. She needs more therapy than she has already had, much more. It sounds like she has never fully processed through her grief and she has built a fantasy around her lost pregnancies where they are all alive. She expects the rest of the family to engage in that fantasy. 11+ years is a long time to dwell in unresolved grief. Until then, she will not be able to move forward.", "I used to work with a woman who used to talk about her 8 children. She was relatively young and I was wondering how she had that many children in such a short time so I asked her how old her children were. It was then that I found out that she'd miscarried 5 times and had 3 children that were in school. I was taken aback by what she'd said and I tried not to react. I worked with this woman for 4 years and she spoke about her children like this the whole time. Everyone found it odd but no-one said anything because from what we could tell, it was still pretty raw for her.  Like this woman, I think your sister is still grieving and probably needs more therapy on a regular basis. \n\nAlso, does your sister have any children or is she childless? If she is childless, this might explain why she's not yet come to terms with having 5 miscarriages and why she wants them acknowledged in some way. \n\nBesides all that I don't think she's right to be bringing up past miscarriages at every chance. NTA", "NTA. She needs professional counselling.", "NTA Your sister needs more therapy or a different therapist because her instance  that everyone acknowledge her miscarried fetuses is not healthy and very odd.", "Personally I would say NTA.\n\nPurely because everyone does deal with loss in their own way and clearly she hasn\u2019t dealt with hers very well, but sometimes there is a time and a place to make these kind of comments she\u2019s making and honestly the times she\u2019s choosing doesn\u2019t sound great. \n\nI understand she may want to communicate her loss to you all, but she needs to do it in a way where she\u2019s safe to talk about it and it isn\u2019t going to wrongly affect others. \n\nI would have a word with her about this, but you have to find a kind way to communicate this across to her. As you don\u2019t want to make this situation more awkward than it already is.", "Nta. She needs some therapy.", "NTA I think her therapy was not really effective. Sometimes people have to actually \"shop around\" to find the right therapist. I understand it will always be painful, but her naming them all, and expecting others to address them on cards and her other demands are really unhealthy behavior. A lot of women don't even know if/when they miscarry, it is something that is far more common than most people realise. It is not healthy to dwell on the past all the time, she needs to start her LIFE moving forward. If she isn't moving forward, she is stuck and the only thing we are certain of is life moves on, with us willing or not. I really hope she tries a different therapist because she has obviously not healed from her trauma at all and her dwelling on it serves no positive purpose for forward movement in her life.", "NTA but she is in dire need of professional help, this is very unhealthy psychologically. Also she should probably get worked up for her multiple losses to see if there\u2019s an underlying medical problem", "NTA, but only if you bring it up in a proper, sympathetic way. Your sister is clearly grieving and feels like she's alone in that. She could really use grief counseling and acknowledgement from her family about her hardships every once in a while", "NTA she sounds obnoxious and delusional no wonder your family doesn\u2019t want her around anymore and she sounds", "NTA\u2026sounds like she needs a new therapist, because clearly the one she has isn\u2019t helping. This behavior is extremely concerning and not healthy.", "NTA how y'all feel is understandable, and you should talk to her, but be very careful about it. She obviously has not healed and has a lot of trauma from her miscarriages. She isn't an AH either, except for the comment about the other losses. She shouldn't be comparing her losses to other people, her losses are not worse. it is all trauma and it's all valid, and her trying to play \"Trauma Olympics\" is messed up. Maybe she could join a group therapy for her situation. I'm sorry for her losses and the cousin. Hope you're family can find a good way to work about this.", "NTA. You don\u2019t get to assign an expiration date to when she\u2019s supposed to be over it, but this is extreme. It\u2019s also possible she hasn\u2019t felt like the family has heard her over the years. She needs therapy, but she also needs to understand the impact her grief and trauma is having on the family.", "Sounds like your sister is struggling a lot, has anyone in the family sat down and had an actual conversation with her about this? Or was this just left to the therapy to sort out?", "NTA so long as you do it in a way that conveys empthy.\n\nEveryone mourns in their own way and at their own pace. \n\nI've had a couple of early miscarriages, myself. Super early. Barely a faint line on the test early. So I know how much it hurts. \n\nOn the other hand. Your sister is being super rude to everyone in the way she brings it up. \n\nSo you should probably be super tactful about how YOU bring it up, or else it's going to get worse because you will come off as insensitive. \n\nStart off by letting her know you hear her, and you know she's hurting. Let her talk it out. \n\nThere's a lot of stigma around miscarriage, an abrupt refusal to acknowledge that a life was lost. \n\nYour sister needs acknowledgement, and she hasn't gotten it. She needs to be told that it's olay to grieve, but also gently reminded that others have their losses, too, amd it's not okay to make them feel like their losses are any less than hers.", "NTA\n\nshe needs inpatient treatment !!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We know your babies were alive. But you need to acknowledge that the losses of others are equal to yours. Your comments are not just uncomfortable, but they're rude and belittling, especially to cousin who lost baby to sids. And it's not possible to paint faces that we never saw into a painting. So how do you think we could have acknowledged them if we didn't even know what they looked like?\"\n\nAs for the anniversaries of her miscarriages, info: is your family Jewish? Because I know in Judaism they light a candle every year on the anniversary of a loved one's death. If not, then this wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nBut maybe create a little memorial service? I did this for mine and it helped a lot. It was just me, my husband, and the dog. But it was enough. \n\n\n(Edit because I accidentally hit post before finishing. \ud83d\ude02)"]}
