Your sister does not need Christmas cards or Memorial cards. She needs more therapy than she has already had, much more. It sounds like she has never fully processed through her grief and she has built a fantasy around her lost pregnancies where they are all alive.

Until then, she will not be able to move forward.", "I used to work with a woman who used to talk about her 8 children. She was relatively young and I was wondering how she had that many children in such a short time so I asked her how old her children were. It was then that I found out that she'd miscarried 5 times and had 3 children that were in school. I was taken aback by what she'd said and I tried not to react. I worked with this woman for 4 years and she spoke about her children like this the whole time. Everyone found it odd but no-one said anything because from what we could tell, it was still pretty raw for her.  Like this woman, I think your sister is still grieving and probably needs more therapy on a regular basis. \n\nAlso, does your sister have any children or is she childless? If she is childless, this might explain why she's not yet come to terms with having 5 miscarriages and why she wants them acknowledged in some way. \n\nBesides all that I don't think she's right to be bringing up past miscarriages at every chance.

Sometimes people have to actually \"shop around\" to find the right therapist. I understand it will always be painful, but her naming them all, and expecting others to address them on cards and her other demands are really unhealthy behavior. A lot of women don't even know if/when they miscarry, it is something that is far more common than most people realise. It is not healthy to dwell on the past all the time, she needs to start her LIFE moving forward. If she isn't moving forward, she is stuck and the only thing we are certain of is life moves on, with us willing or not. I really hope she tries a different therapist because she has obviously not healed from her trauma at all and her dwelling on it serves no positive purpose for forward movement in her life.", "NTA but she is in dire need of professional help, this is very unhealthy psychologically.

Super early. Barely a faint line on the test early. So I know how much it hurts. \n\nOn the other hand. Your sister is being super rude to everyone in the way she brings it up. \n\nSo you should probably be super tactful about how YOU bring it up, or else it's going to get worse because you will come off as insensitive. \n\nStart off by letting her know you hear her, and you know she's hurting. Let her talk it out. \n\nThere's a lot of stigma around miscarriage, an abrupt refusal to acknowledge that a life was lost. \n\nYour sister needs acknowledgement, and she hasn't gotten it. She needs to be told that it's olay to grieve, but also gently reminded that others have their losses, too, amd it's not okay to make them feel like their losses are any less than hers.", "NTA\n\nshe needs inpatient treatment !!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At this point it's all about protecting your cousin and I would not risk hoping that your sister will keep her mouth shut. She's not going to listen to you if you tell her to stop, she'll just increase the drama.\n\nNo doubt she's suffered loss and disappointment, but she's being absurd to demand the family treat her first trimester losses the same as a SIDS death.

Her comments and actions are deeply inappropriate. Yes, her miscarriages are tragic. And no, probably nobody will know the pain of losing 5 pregnancies.

I've had multiple pregnancy losses over the last few years and it definitely is a kind of pain that I know will stick with me for the rest of my life, but your sister is not dealing with this properly. I've named only one of the babies I've lost (lost her at 19 weeks) so I definitely understand how giving them names are apart of the healing process, but centering the rest of her life around these tragedies is not healthy. I could not imagine losing a baby to SIDS and making that comparison is extremely disrespectful. Yes it's okay to grieve, I plan on getting a tattoo in memory of my losses, but bombarding every family event about it isn't good. The only thing she's doing is pushing away the very support system she craves. \n\nHas she tried any other coping mechanisms? I would ask her if she thinks this is something that her kids would want her to do. Every time I start to let the sadness hit me, especially during the holidays, I always ask myself that question and it definitely helps me not go too far down the rabbit hole. My husband and I also have a space in our closet with our daughter's ashes, small candles, and a teddy bear as our memorial for them. I look at that daily and it honestly helps me feel more connected to them. In addition to all of this, my husband and I went to therapy (both together and separate) for about 2 years in order to help process our grief.

I believe your sister is grieving possibilities, and  the repeated losses. In doing so to this degree, she is isolating herself and holding herself back. I wonder if she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder? It seems very unhealthy to make this her identity. NTA. This must be very hard for the family to cope with.", "Your whole family is TA. It\u2019s obviously important to your sister that her family recognizes her losses. They were real babies to her. She had hopes and dreams for each of them, and lost them all. And the more she expresses that she needs more support from you, the more you all dismiss her and withdraw support.", "Suspect YTA since you didn't say anything about whether or not she ever managed to carry a child to term. That makes a huge difference in how much the five miscarriages would hurt, even 11 years ago.", "I don\u2019t know how you can even compare miscarriages - especially first trimester - with losing an actual child you\u2019ve held, you\u2019ve fed, you\u2019ve played with, and that you\u2019ve grown attached to and loved. I heard somewhere that 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage, and some folks never know they were pregnant - especially if you already have bad periods and a fucked up cycle. It\u2019s totally fine for her to name her \u201cchildren\u201d if that helps her - my sister miscarried and did so - but demanding cards addressed to them? Including them in a painting of the family - as what? Blobs of cells? She\u2019s got serious issues, and therapy clearly didn\u2019t help. It could\u2019ve even made things worse - therapists vary so much because there\u2019s not really a standard of care. But yeah, that\u2019s just not the same as losing a living child, even though it may seem to her that it is.\n\n\nI would hope the sister gets help and finds peace, it\u2019s not healthy to stew in grief till you\u2019re demanding people treat them like living children, especially when she ruins family stuff with this.

This isn't a normal or healthy reaction to miscarriages. Or any other trauma, for that matter, if 11 years has passed and you still haven't gotten past it then you're gonna need some help with that.

NTA", "NTA. She needs to go back to therapy. More than just for the miscarriages.", "She does not need acknowledgement about her hardships once in a while after 11 years.  That will let her continue to be like this instead of healing and moving on.", "that's rather hard, but a semi-fair assessment. sister genuinely needs to go to therapy to properly grieve and resolve this chapter in her life. she needs to come to terms with her pregnancies not being viable=they aren't real children.", "I can agree to this comment. I can\u2019t get over people glossing over the fact this woman is possibly infertile and that\u2019s probably why she\u2019s struggling so much. People who are capable of carrying to term don\u2019t normally miscarry 5 times in a row in 9 years. \u201cThe last one was 11 years ago\u201d because she probably had to give up trying! And the comments about \u201cwhat were they supposed to do paint 1 inch purple jellybeans?\u201d Like you really can\u2019t think of a single way to represent a lost soul that doesn\u2019t boil down to their body? How hard would it be to paint some stars in the corner or some flowers in the grass, unimaginative loons. She\u2019s not handling this well, but did anyone in this family handle it well?", "but nta", "Because the way she\u2019s acting is insufferable", "I said above in another comment that she doesn\u2019t have any children that were born.", "Tbh, I cringe sometimes in these threads when everyone pushes therapy on the OP because you\u2019re right, there is no standard of care. I\u2019ve been seeing therapists since I was 14. I\u2019ve probably been to over a dozen different ones over the course of my life and exactly two were actually competent at their jobs. There are so many therapists who not only don\u2019t help - they cause actual harm- that I can\u2019t in good conscience recommend therapy to anyone.", "Just a question, but does she have a significant other? Is there someone in the picture who also experienced these losses? A miscarriage affects both partners, so I just wonder how hers has been taking them.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and correct you. She isn't childless, she had five children, all of which passed extremely early and before term. I know we live in a society where miscarriages aren't supposed to \"count\" but I come from a culture where they very much do count and I can tell you the women I know who've had them have much healthier grief processing because of it because their feelings aren't being invalidated by people who try to tell them they've essentially never been a mother, etc. And it doesn't hurt anyone if they want to add the planned names of their lost children to a Christmas card THEY SEND every so often during the grieving process. \n\nI do agree you're not TA here bc I think your sister's anger reactions are extreme and indicative of some needed additional counseling, but I also think it's fair to acknowledge that she probably hasn't gotten the support she really needed to process the early losses, which may be contributing to her current state.", "Info: have you ever tried to include them in ways that don\u2019t relate to other grandchildren? Why can\u2019t you guys write their names next to hers when sending her cards?", "Did you get to have another child? What are the chances your sister is infertile?", "I agree with you. I've never sought therapy for any thing intense, but my small experience has absolutely agreeded with your advice. \n\nWhen you're in a fragile state, why is that the time to start interviewing therapists for compatability and being willing to blap your issues onto a total stranger?\n\nNot that I'm sensitive about it or anything.", "I\u2019ve seen 4 therapists (that I can remember, I know I\u2019ve seen one or two more that  didn\u2019t work out but I was young and they weren\u2019t bad enough for me to remember.) Out of those four one was really helpful, two were nice but didn\u2019t really help, and the last made me cry every session. I would recommend therapy to people who can advocate for themselves and realize that the therapist is not a good fit for them, but not everyone. For some people it\u2019s worth it, but depending on your current mental state it could just make things worse.", "thank you for saying this... I've had 4 miscarriages total (3 in the last 2 years) and I don't feel childless. I feel like a mother who has lost her babies. I don't expect things like OPs sister (she needs more grief therapy... as do I which I'm receiving), but this whole post right down to the \"attention seeking\" comment rubbed me the wrong way... I don't think this sister got a lot of support.  She needs help.", "Some things, like the grandchildren painting, I can understand to an extent. But how much would it hurt to write down their names alongside hers on a card dedicated to her? Were they this crass with the first or second miscarriage? 8-11 weeks doesn\u2019t seem long but it\u2019s enough time to alter the woman. I know someone who chose to abort and she says there are parts of her body that are different. Her body hair became darker, her body is set different. The woman went through 5 miscarriages, she\u2019s not going to be the same. I agree the SIDS reference was disgusting but did they ever care about her? Do they give a single shit that she\u2019s probably infertile and these 5 fetuses were the closest she\u2019ll ever get?", "At 9 weeks, the fetus is like an inch long with no defining features, and at 11 weeks it's only the size of a fig. \n\nThere's no way to add them in because no one knows what they'd look like.\n\nShe needs help", "But how would you paint children in to represent fetuses that never developed any discernible features? Did she want 5 random stock children painted in? That would be so creepy to think that somewhere out there is a real child whose picture was added into someone's painting to represent a nonviable pregnancy. And they were at a gestational age where they had indifferent genitalia. So how is she choosing gender? Flipping a coin? Or are they all named something gender neutral?", "I just have no idea how to even begin to have the conversation with her. Like, what's your plan, OP? Is it just you, you and your parents? How do you have this conversation without it going nuclear?", "That's really stupid and obnoxious. Your sister needs to pull herself together.", "I'm all for most of this, but the suggestion that a 9 week miscarriage is equal to a 3 months crib death is deeply offensive to me. It really strikes a nerve.", "I guess for the same reason I didn\u2019t include my grandfather on cards I send my grandmother after he passed.", "Yes, I had one before the m/c and then 2 afterwards.", "I hear ya. It\u2019s an industry like any other. Some people are rock stars, but most are regular, flawed people like everyone else, just trying to do as little as possible while still collecting a paycheck. That might be okay for car salesman but it\u2019s pure hell in a profession where the customer is so vulnerable, in so much need of real help.", "Agreed. Sadly this entire thread is going the same way so I doubt OP will change her mind. I'm sorry for your losses- it's really tough for women to go through these things and we don't give them the help they need anywhere near enough.", "What's offensive about it? What strikes a nerve? Is it because it forces you to acknowledge that the preborn child is a living human being to which a mother can grow attached and the loss of whom it is valid to mourn? \n\nBecause it is 100% valid to mourn a miscarriage and the loss IS equal because it IS a living human. \n\nBoth of my miscarriages were super hard on me. I cried. I mourned them. \n\nThey were lost at about the same point, too. \n\nMourning miscarriages should be normalized. \n\nSupporting parents who have lost a child to miscarriage should be normalized. \n\nThose of us who have lost babies before they were born should never be shamed into being silent and not talking about it. \n\nThere is a time and place and OP's sister definitely needs to not be tearing others down or saying things that discount other people's losses. But just because OP's sister needs to acknowledge that other losses are not lesser to her own just because she lost 5 and the cousin only lost one, that doesn't mean 5 miscarriages or even just one are less painful than losing a child to sids. \n\nTo say that losing a child to miscarriage or stillbirth isn't just as painful and isn't just as legitimate a loss is to dehumanize the lost baby.", "So true. I teared up describing my concern. I was diagnosed as depressed in 4 minutes and given a prescription. \n\nNow I treat my issues with story (books and audiobooks) exercise, husband-hugs, and chocolate. And reddit.", "How well does that argument go over with folks like OPs cousin, who lost a three month old?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with mourning a MC and I agree that mourning a MC should be normalized...but an 8 week embryo is NOT THE SAME as a three month old. \n\nI'm sorry for your losses, but your stance on this speaks volumes. Fingers crossed that one day you will have the opportunity to understand this.", "I\u2019m so sorry. I hope you are doing better now. I got a glimpse into how things really work when I was 19. My mother took me to the ER b/c I was having a panic attack and she didn\u2019t know what was happening or what to do about it. They sent me to the lock up psych ward on suicide watch even though both my mother and I told them I wasn\u2019t suicidal. A nurse later explained to me that my insurance wouldn\u2019t pay for hospitalization unless I was suicidal. They kept me there (and put me on lithium) for four days until I actually spoke with a psychiatrist. He immediately took me off lithium and discharged me. That\u2019s was in 1993 and I hope to god it\u2019s better than that now, but it\u2019s still a for profit industry so it\u2019s hard to believe things like that don\u2019t still happen.", "I think it\u2019s silly to compare them at all. This infertile woman will never get to be a mother, which she so desperately wants. She wants it enough to lose it a devastating 5 times. This isn\u2019t the pain Olympics and I don\u2019t think comparing an infertile woman with five losses pain to the mother of a 2m old is even remotely useful or helpful to anyone. OP\u2019s sister needs professional help", "But they ARE the same. \n\nThey're both human beings at different stages of development, and comments like yours are the type of thing that shame women who have had miscarriages into staying silent.", "That's crappy. Hope you're better too. I've got a lot of physical things going, but a big realization is that I feel sad BECAUSE I hurt, rather than I feel sad THEREFORE I hurt. \n\nThe only thing that sucks worse than the way insurance works is not having any. Not being believed sucks too. \n\nStory helps because it takes me out of my head. Audio helps sleep-broken nights. Having four virtual library cards *really* helps. I feel rich! \n\nDigging for hope helps. Finding it helps more.", "Like I said, I hope one day you have the chance to realize the difference. Good luck.", "I can really relate to what you\u2019re saying. Lately I\u2019ve been going on long walks while listening to podcasts. The exercise reduces my anxiety and the podcasts keep me from being (drowning) in my head while I\u2019m exercising.", "Will never happen because there is no difference. \n\nI hope you never have to deal with that kind of pain.", "Any exercise reduces my stress and makes me feel more \"normal \". Right now that's elliptical, weight training and Krav Maga classes. Which is so much fun plus a friend group. I am a once and future triathlete with RA flares and nerve damage after spinal fusion. Sounds hopeless, but I keep finding new options and the family helps. \n\nI gave up podcasts for romance and thrillers. The pandemic took all the fun out of facts! \n\nI think audio anything could help a lot more folks...there's more than music!", "What makes you think first hand experience has nothing to do with my comment?"]}
