Your sister needs some serious counseling and grief therapy. You all can have empathy for her in general, without the extremes of birthday and sympathy cards x5 every year forever. And while a MC is terrible it\u2019s not the same as losing a child to SIDS and she needs to stop being so self centered that she would somehow make that tragedy about herself.", "NTA. Your sister does not need Christmas cards or Memorial cards. She needs more therapy than she has already had, much more. It sounds like she has never fully processed through her grief and she has built a fantasy around her lost pregnancies where they are all alive. She expects the rest of the family to engage in that fantasy. 11+ years is a long time to dwell in unresolved grief. Until then, she will not be able to move forward.", "I used to work with a woman who used to talk about her 8 children. She was relatively young and I was wondering how she had that many children in such a short time so I asked her how old her children were. It was then that I found out that she'd miscarried 5 times and had 3 children that were in school. I was taken aback by what she'd said and I tried not to react. I worked with this woman for 4 years and she spoke about her children like this the whole time. Everyone found it odd but no-one said anything because from what we could tell, it was still pretty raw for her.  Like this woman, I think your sister is still grieving and probably needs more therapy on a regular basis. \n\nAlso, does your sister have any children or is she childless? If she is childless, this might explain why she's not yet come to terms with having 5 miscarriages and why she wants them acknowledged in some way. \n\nBesides all that I don't think she's right to be bringing up past miscarriages at every chance. NTA", "NTA. She needs professional counselling.", "NTA Your sister needs more therapy or a different therapist because her instance  that everyone acknowledge her miscarried fetuses is not healthy and very odd.", "Personally I would say NTA.\n\nPurely because everyone does deal with loss in their own way and clearly she hasn\u2019t dealt with hers very well, but sometimes there is a time and a place to make these kind of comments she\u2019s making and honestly the times she\u2019s choosing doesn\u2019t sound great. \n\nI understand she may want to communicate her loss to you all, but she needs to do it in a way where she\u2019s safe to talk about it and it isn\u2019t going to wrongly affect others. \n\nI would have a word with her about this, but you have to find a kind way to communicate this across to her. As you don\u2019t want to make this situation more awkward than it already is.", "Nta. She needs some therapy.", "NTA I think her therapy was not really effective. Sometimes people have to actually \"shop around\" to find the right therapist. I understand it will always be painful, but her naming them all, and expecting others to address them on cards and her other demands are really unhealthy behavior. A lot of women don't even know if/when they miscarry, it is something that is far more common than most people realise. It is not healthy to dwell on the past all the time, she needs to start her LIFE moving forward. If she isn't moving forward, she is stuck and the only thing we are certain of is life moves on, with us willing or not. I really hope she tries a different therapist because she has obviously not healed from her trauma at all and her dwelling on it serves no positive purpose for forward movement in her life.", "NTA but she is in dire need of professional help, this is very unhealthy psychologically. Also she should probably get worked up for her multiple losses to see if there\u2019s an underlying medical problem", "NTA, but only if you bring it up in a proper, sympathetic way. Your sister is clearly grieving and feels like she's alone in that. She could really use grief counseling and acknowledgement from her family about her hardships every once in a while", "NTA she sounds obnoxious and delusional no wonder your family doesn\u2019t want her around anymore and she sounds", "NTA\u2026sounds like she needs a new therapist, because clearly the one she has isn\u2019t helping. This behavior is extremely concerning and not healthy.", "NTA how y'all feel is understandable, and you should talk to her, but be very careful about it. She obviously has not healed and has a lot of trauma from her miscarriages. She isn't an AH either, except for the comment about the other losses. She shouldn't be comparing her losses to other people, her losses are not worse. it is all trauma and it's all valid, and her trying to play \"Trauma Olympics\" is messed up. Maybe she could join a group therapy for her situation. I'm sorry for her losses and the cousin. Hope you're family can find a good way to work about this.", "NTA. You don\u2019t get to assign an expiration date to when she\u2019s supposed to be over it, but this is extreme. It\u2019s also possible she hasn\u2019t felt like the family has heard her over the years. She needs therapy, but she also needs to understand the impact her grief and trauma is having on the family.", "Sounds like your sister is struggling a lot, has anyone in the family sat down and had an actual conversation with her about this? Or was this just left to the therapy to sort out?", "NTA so long as you do it in a way that conveys empthy.\n\nEveryone mourns in their own way and at their own pace. \n\nI've had a couple of early miscarriages, myself. Super early. Barely a faint line on the test early. So I know how much it hurts. \n\nOn the other hand. Your sister is being super rude to everyone in the way she brings it up. \n\nSo you should probably be super tactful about how YOU bring it up, or else it's going to get worse because you will come off as insensitive. \n\nStart off by letting her know you hear her, and you know she's hurting. Let her talk it out. \n\nThere's a lot of stigma around miscarriage, an abrupt refusal to acknowledge that a life was lost. \n\nYour sister needs acknowledgement, and she hasn't gotten it. She needs to be told that it's olay to grieve, but also gently reminded that others have their losses, too, amd it's not okay to make them feel like their losses are any less than hers.", "NTA\n\nshe needs inpatient treatment !!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We know your babies were alive. But you need to acknowledge that the losses of others are equal to yours. Your comments are not just uncomfortable, but they're rude and belittling, especially to cousin who lost baby to sids. And it's not possible to paint faces that we never saw into a painting. So how do you think we could have acknowledged them if we didn't even know what they looked like?\"\n\nAs for the anniversaries of her miscarriages, info: is your family Jewish? Because I know in Judaism they light a candle every year on the anniversary of a loved one's death. If not, then this wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nBut maybe create a little memorial service? I did this for mine and it helped a lot. It was just me, my husband, and the dog.

NTA this is unhinged", "NTA, but just stop including her in family gatherings. Your cousin absolutely should not have been subjected to your sister all but stating that her loss is bigger than your cousin's. At this point it's all about protecting your cousin and I would not risk hoping that your sister will keep her mouth shut. She's not going to listen to you if you tell her to stop, she'll just increase the drama.\n\nNo doubt she's suffered loss and disappointment, but she's being absurd to demand the family treat her first trimester losses the same as a SIDS death. It's not unlikely that somewhere in your family, there were other miscarriages as well that you don't even know about, because it's that common.", "NTA. Her comments and actions are deeply inappropriate. Yes, her miscarriages are tragic. And no, probably nobody will know the pain of losing 5 pregnancies. But she has to stop this ridiculous idea that they should be included in family things. They weren't viable. Sorry if that's harsh but they weren't. She needs intensive therapy.", "NTA, but it wouldn't do any good. I vote for just allowing people to stop including her and have time with your family without her there to make it all about her. If she asks why she's being left out, then it's a good time to tell her. She'll still flip out, but it will be because she asked for the information she doesn't want to hear.\n\nI'm not bringing up therapy because it's a guarantee it's been mentioned and an even bigger guarantee she believes she does/t need it, it's the world that's messed up for not centering around her as it should.", "NTA. I might be wrong here but I think it's more of an attention-seeking thing than undealt grief.\nMy family has a hereditary issue that makes it really hard to come to term with children and it's something we all know and aknowledge but we don't take every chance we get to talk about the lost babies.\nAlso, it's not the same to have a miscarriage than to have a child and loose it. I feel for your cousin, I cannot even begin to imagine what she's been trough.", "NTA. It sucks that she's miscarried so many times, but to be completely unsympathetic when your cousin has lost a child that was born, named and held in loving arms before passing is way too far. She's using the miscarriages to make everything about her.", "Nta I have had 7 miscarriages one being at 25 weeks and I wouldn\u2019t dream of expecting cards for each of them", "NTA. Your sister needs help", "NTA  \n\n\nShe need's professional counseling, unfortunately there isn't much y'all can do to help her.", "NTA I've my share of MC, I didnt name them but I buried them where I go camping. I get to visit them and have my time of sadness and continue on. I don't drag other people onto it, I don't even think my husband should be forced to join me if he doesn't want to.", "Surprising to me that the judgment isn\u2019t NAH. OP, you\u2019re not wrong, but your sister also isn\u2019t an AH but someone deeply messed up by repeated and inadequately processes trauma. I hope she gets the help she clearly needs.", "NTA\n\nShe definitely needs some therapy. I've had multiple pregnancy losses over the last few years and it definitely is a kind of pain that I know will stick with me for the rest of my life, but your sister is not dealing with this properly. I've named only one of the babies I've lost (lost her at 19 weeks) so I definitely understand how giving them names are apart of the healing process, but centering the rest of her life around these tragedies is not healthy. I could not imagine losing a baby to SIDS and making that comparison is extremely disrespectful. Yes it's okay to grieve, I plan on getting a tattoo in memory of my losses, but bombarding every family event about it isn't good. The only thing she's doing is pushing away the very support system she craves. \n\nHas she tried any other coping mechanisms? I would ask her if she thinks this is something that her kids would want her to do. Every time I start to let the sadness hit me, especially during the holidays, I always ask myself that question and it definitely helps me not go too far down the rabbit hole. My husband and I also have a space in our closet with our daughter's ashes, small candles, and a teddy bear as our memorial for them. I look at that daily and it honestly helps me feel more connected to them. In addition to all of this, my husband and I went to therapy (both together and separate) for about 2 years in order to help process our grief. She definitely needs to see a better therapist because who she saw last did not do a good job of setting her up to live the rest of her life.", "NTA. Couple sandwiches short of a picnic with that one.", "NTA. I had an ectopic pregnancy. I don't expect anyone else to remember the dates I remember and hold close to me.", "NTA! I was desperately trying to hold some space for her until I read what she said about the recent loss of your cousin's child. Something *that* cruel cannot be overlooked. It just can't. The other things you listed are clearly nuts, but in the kind of way where you can at least recognize the mental illness behind it. But refusing to let the parents of a SIDs baby receive support for their grief because she's jealous?! Just NO! That's like 40 levels of wtf.", "NTA. She needs extensive therapy here but she also needs to be told how this is alienating her from the rest of the family more and more if she continues to act this way.", "A miscarriage is a spontaneous abortion, an indication that the the fetus was not viable, and not going to make it to term. Most miscarriages happen early, and late miscarriages happen in 1-2% of pregnancies. My point is, \u201cchild\u201d is a stretch. I believe your sister is grieving possibilities, and  the repeated losses. In doing so to this degree, she is isolating herself and holding herself back. I wonder if she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder? It seems very unhealthy to make this her identity. NTA. This must be very hard for the family to cope with.", "Your whole family is TA. It\u2019s obviously important to your sister that her family recognizes her losses. They were real babies to her. She had hopes and dreams for each of them, and lost them all. And the more she expresses that she needs more support from you, the more you all dismiss her and withdraw support.", "Suspect YTA since you didn't say anything about whether or not she ever managed to carry a child to term. That makes a huge difference in how much the five miscarriages would hurt, even 11 years ago.", "I don\u2019t know how you can even compare miscarriages - especially first trimester - with losing an actual child you\u2019ve held, you\u2019ve fed, you\u2019ve played with, and that you\u2019ve grown attached to and loved. I heard somewhere that 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage, and some folks never know they were pregnant - especially if you already have bad periods and a fucked up cycle. It\u2019s totally fine for her to name her \u201cchildren\u201d if that helps her - my sister miscarried and did so - but demanding cards addressed to them? Including them in a painting of the family - as what? Blobs of cells? She\u2019s got serious issues, and therapy clearly didn\u2019t help. It could\u2019ve even made things worse - therapists vary so much because there\u2019s not really a standard of care. But yeah, that\u2019s just not the same as losing a living child, even though it may seem to her that it is.\n\n\nI would hope the sister gets help and finds peace, it\u2019s not healthy to stew in grief till you\u2019re demanding people treat them like living children, especially when she ruins family stuff with this. I kind of doubt that she\u2019ll realize it\u2019s a problem and go see a therapist on her own.", "Yep, especially if she only did CBT or another standard type. This feels like trauma and EMDR would be a better fit.", "Right?! Info: how exactly did she expect them to be included in the painting?", "Blanket statements don't work, I'm relieved that I miscarried and don't think about it unless miscarriage is brought up. No emotion attached to it, though I was very sad at the time I was able to process it quickly. I'm probably on the more extreme casual end, middle would be like my mother who thinks about it on occasion and gets pangs of grief but it's OFC healed over time and isn't disruptive, other extreme end would be OP's sister who clearly hasn't been able to process it and needs more professional counseling. This isn't a normal or healthy reaction to miscarriages. Or any other trauma, for that matter, if 11 years has passed and you still haven't gotten past it then you're gonna need some help with that. More help than she's gotten, at least, it's even more abnormal for it to still be this bad after therapy.", "She thought they should have been included as \u201cangel babies\u201d, painted fainter than the other children.", "I'm just imagining someone painting little pink dots/beans into the painting, just floating around in the background! XD", "I would make them purple. Like a lavender color."]}
