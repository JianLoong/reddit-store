Guess what 2nd hand stores in the midwest get? Jackets that will keep you warm in midwest temperatures. \n\nYour sister is entiled and greedy, you bought a jacket at a high price because you earned yoir money, and therefore understand you can take care of it and last your lifetime. She just sees a \"status symbol\" that will help her self image, yet doing absolutely nothing to earn or deserve it. You are NTA by any means, but she deffinatly is", "NTA.

If any relative has a key, get it back and/or change the locks.  \n\nYou might want to write your name inside the sleeve or lining somewhere, in case you ever have to prove ownership.

I don't give a fuck anymore. I've lived here all of my nearly 35 years. We see people here wearing fleece pjs to the Krogers and we mind our business about it. No one needs a branded coat here.
