{"id": 11614, "submission_id": "11jwavq", "title": "AITA for turning off my ex's service after he failed to respond on what he owes for his part of the phone bill?", "selftext": "So I (40M) have been on my phone plan for 1.5 years after dropping off my family plan to be on my phone plan. In October 2021, I decided to add my boyfriend at the time (45M) as a way to help him out as his service was not the best. We set up a cost for his phone which included the service and scheduled payments for the devices. We broke up in April 2022 but agreed to remain friends. During that time, he kept paying the phone bill with I sending him the pay schedule.\n\nAround November 2022, I noticed he would dodge some of my texts on the phone bill and he mentioned that he was going through a rough patch. I told him that I understood and not to ignore the text messages as that only makes things worse. December came when he said he could not pay after dodging my messages came again and I covered his part of the phone bill by informing him to pay me back.\n\nJanuary arrived and he said he was going to take care of it and pay me back. The due date of the phone bill came and I was getting charged for it. I told him to pay me 2 months of back pay plus the current amount. He decided to ghost me. I got action as my mother texted him threatening legal action. He sent the money for February only with his promise to pay me back.\n\nBoth my mom and I reached out to him two weeks ago about paying for March with the two months of back pay. No response from him. We both mentioned legal action, turning off service, and declaring the devices stolen for non-payment. There was even an option of just returning the devices to me or my family, or setting up a payment plan. Still nothing.\n\nSo I decided to do one last thing. At 12:00, I wrote him a message stating that if he does not respond with any form of a resolution by 20:00, he will have all services turned off and all devices declared stolen. Eight hours came and went with no response. So I turned off all devices as I said I would and marked them stolen with my service provider.\n\nI thought I would sleep well but a part of my mind kept me up for part of the night making excuses for him. So Reddit, let me know if I TA or not.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the responses and for helping me out. As to those stating my mom has interfered beyond her limits need to step back off that. Firstly, I moved back home after I fell into addiction and started my road to recovery back in September. So the fact that she took over for a lot was helpful to me as I couldn't be where I am now with 5 months of sobriety if it wasn't for her. Secondly, any mother will defend her child no matter what age their children are.\n\nAs for why my mother helped me out, it was because she heard from me all the struggles that I was going through with him. It was to a point my fragile sanity and sobriety were at risk of full-on panic attacks, insomnia, and relapse. As such, she jumped in to help me out. Besides, Hispanic moms are always close to their kids. I have never seen any other culture be this close except Hispanics. Beyond that, I  will leave it here for now. I will now field any other questions about why my mom has taken it upon herself to help me out.", "created_utc": 1678102167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jwavq/aita_for_turning_off_my_exs_service_after_he/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It isn't right to put your head in the sand when you struggle to pay bills, but you know, money problems and mental health problems (they often go hand in hand) make people irrational, and dumb. However, you are definitely NTA. You gave your ex every chance to make this right or come to some sort of agreement.

What does he expect? You to cover his phone bill indefinitely?\n\n\nJust a side note, keep your mother out of it, though. Threatening legal action\u2026 is extremely unwise. It\u2019s the sort of thing best left to lawyers. Especially unwise if it\u2019s an empty threat. Threatening to sue can be a form of blackmail. \n\nI realize she\u2019s just trying to help,  it could very easily cause a court to dismiss your claim if it goes to small claims court.", "NTA - Grown ass 45 year old man can pay his own phone bill.

Why is your mother involved in this?!??", "NTA\n\nYou gave notice, he promised to compensate but didn't. IF he drags his heels on all of this you are not required to continually subsidise him.

He\u2019ll figure it out.", "NTA, you're a good guy", "I disagree. It's prime asshole behaviour to duck/dodge/ghost someone you owe money to.\n\nI DGAF what a person's excuses are. If they owe money, they should communicate with the person they owe it to instead of shutting down communication.

That's shitty logic right there.", "Exactly how i would have put it myself.

No response from him\n\nYour ex has been taking the mick. I'm guessing he assumed you'd keep paying it, as it stands he's had a few free months out of you. Might want to make sure he's not on your Netflix or anything while you're at it, I know a lot of people stay logged into their ex's accounts.\n\nNTA\n\nCongratulations on 5 months sober by the way, I know that can't be easy.

You can have a support system but they should not involve themselves actively.", "Just clarifying what I meant by bad guy: as a teacher, I often have to be the bad guy. I have to stop the fun. I have to end the jokes. I have to get the kids focused on work again while they're goofing off. I have to tell kids they're going to fail my class if they don't get their act together.

I guess my disconnect is when I'm in that spot I don't have anyone I have to say anything to. I have a partner but I handle the finances so I'm not in a spot where I have to pat someone else if that makes sense.

I agree that in this situation the ex is the AH but I do see what you mean as well. Sortve like the saying that love makes you do crazy things, so does money"]}
