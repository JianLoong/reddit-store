{"id": 11614, "submission_id": "11jwavq", "title": "AITA for turning off my ex's service after he failed to respond on what he owes for his part of the phone bill?", "selftext": "So I (40M) have been on my phone plan for 1.5 years after dropping off my family plan to be on my phone plan. In October 2021, I decided to add my boyfriend at the time (45M) as a way to help him out as his service was not the best. We set up a cost for his phone which included the service and scheduled payments for the devices. We broke up in April 2022 but agreed to remain friends. During that time, he kept paying the phone bill with I sending him the pay schedule.\n\nAround November 2022, I noticed he would dodge some of my texts on the phone bill and he mentioned that he was going through a rough patch. I told him that I understood and not to ignore the text messages as that only makes things worse. December came when he said he could not pay after dodging my messages came again and I covered his part of the phone bill by informing him to pay me back.\n\nJanuary arrived and he said he was going to take care of it and pay me back. The due date of the phone bill came and I was getting charged for it. I told him to pay me 2 months of back pay plus the current amount. He decided to ghost me. I got action as my mother texted him threatening legal action. He sent the money for February only with his promise to pay me back.\n\nBoth my mom and I reached out to him two weeks ago about paying for March with the two months of back pay. No response from him. We both mentioned legal action, turning off service, and declaring the devices stolen for non-payment. There was even an option of just returning the devices to me or my family, or setting up a payment plan. Still nothing.\n\nSo I decided to do one last thing. At 12:00, I wrote him a message stating that if he does not respond with any form of a resolution by 20:00, he will have all services turned off and all devices declared stolen. Eight hours came and went with no response. So I turned off all devices as I said I would and marked them stolen with my service provider.\n\nI thought I would sleep well but a part of my mind kept me up for part of the night making excuses for him. So Reddit, let me know if I TA or not.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the responses and for helping me out. As to those stating my mom has interfered beyond her limits need to step back off that. Firstly, I moved back home after I fell into addiction and started my road to recovery back in September. So the fact that she took over for a lot was helpful to me as I couldn't be where I am now with 5 months of sobriety if it wasn't for her. Secondly, any mother will defend her child no matter what age their children are.\n\nAs for why my mother helped me out, it was because she heard from me all the struggles that I was going through with him. It was to a point my fragile sanity and sobriety were at risk of full-on panic attacks, insomnia, and relapse. As such, she jumped in to help me out. Besides, Hispanic moms are always close to their kids. I have never seen any other culture be this close except Hispanics. Beyond that, I  will leave it here for now. I will now field any other questions about why my mom has taken it upon herself to help me out.", "created_utc": 1678102167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jwavq/aita_for_turning_off_my_exs_service_after_he/", "score": 324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
