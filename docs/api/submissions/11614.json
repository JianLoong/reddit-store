In October 2021, I decided to add my boyfriend at the time (45M) as a way to help him out as his service was not the best. We set up a cost for his phone which included the service and scheduled payments for the devices. We broke up in April 2022 but agreed to remain friends. During that time, he kept paying the phone bill with I sending him the pay schedule.\n\nAround November 2022, I noticed he would dodge some of my texts on the phone bill and he mentioned that he was going through a rough patch. I told him that I understood and not to ignore the text messages as that only makes things worse. December came when he said he could not pay after dodging my messages came again and I covered his part of the phone bill by informing him to pay me back.\n\nJanuary arrived and he said he was going to take care of it and pay me back. The due date of the phone bill came and I was getting charged for it. I told him to pay me 2 months of back pay plus the current amount. He decided to ghost me. I got action as my mother texted him threatening legal action. He sent the money for February only with his promise to pay me back.\n\nBoth my mom and I reached out to him two weeks ago about paying for March with the two months of back pay. No response from him. We both mentioned legal action, turning off service, and declaring the devices stolen for non-payment. There was even an option of just returning the devices to me or my family, or setting up a payment plan. Still nothing.\n\nSo I decided to do one last thing. At 12:00, I wrote him a message stating that if he does not respond with any form of a resolution by 20:00, he will have all services turned off and all devices declared stolen. Eight hours came and went with no response. So I turned off all devices as I said I would and marked them stolen with my service provider.\n\nI thought I would sleep well but a part of my mind kept me up for part of the night making excuses for him. So Reddit, let me know if I TA or not.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the responses and for helping me out. As to those stating my mom has interfered beyond her limits need to step back off that. Firstly, I moved back home after I fell into addiction and started my road to recovery back in September. So the fact that she took over for a lot was helpful to me as I couldn't be where I am now with 5 months of sobriety if it wasn't for her. Secondly, any mother will defend her child no matter what age their children are.\n\nAs for why my mother helped me out, it was because she heard from me all the struggles that I was going through with him. It was to a point my fragile sanity and sobriety were at risk of full-on panic attacks, insomnia, and relapse. As such, she jumped in to help me out. Besides, Hispanic moms are always close to their kids. I have never seen any other culture be this close except Hispanics. Beyond that, I  will leave it here for now. I will now field any other questions about why my mom has taken it upon herself to help me out.", "created_utc": 1678102167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jwavq/aita_for_turning_off_my_exs_service_after_he/", "score": 663, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Guess what she still has me make her dr appointments. Why because she like her siblings will maybe my babies.", "Full NTA. You were very nice to him and he dodged you on purpose. He can eff off and get his own service. You owe him no kindness.", "I'm OK with everything you've done, except for reporting the phone stolen.  That makes this ESH.  If you stop making car payments, the car gets repoed.  If you take someone else's car, you go to jail for grand theft auto.  He didn't steal the phone, so it's wrong of you to report it stolen.  Unfortunately if you signed off on him getting the phone as part of your plan, you probably did take on the responsibility of making sure the phone company gets paid for it, like co-signing a loan.  \n\nRead the fine print of your contract/check with the phone company, but please try to undo reporting the phone as stolen.  You could get in trouble for filing a false report.   \n Absolutely go after him to get the phone back since he isn't paying, and don't feel bad in the slightest about cutting off service.  IANAL, but I'm certain that this is a civil matter, not a criminal one, and you should treat it like one.", "OP is a guy and his mom sounds awesome.", "NTA. I would have taken him off the day after the break up though. This did not need to be dragged out as long as it has been", "Technically it is stolen though. He's out of contact with OP and is apparently refusing to respond to countless messages. OP has no access to the device and can't even use the device he now has to pay for so I think it was entirely appropriate to report the phone stolen. NTA, OP.", "Part of rehabilitation is taking responsibility. Having mommy do it for OP is very different from consulting her.", "Leaning on them would be asking for advice not having them acting on the situation. This is enabling.", "I am specifically responding to the comment that says \u201cif OP was a woman\u201d.", "People helping you with things is absolutely leaning on your support system. Enabling\u2026what?", "Ignore these AH commenters -- some people just can't imagine what it's like to have a strong support system in their parents, so they take it out on those who do.", "NTA", "op=NTA\n\nyou gave him time and multiple warnings.", "NTA", "Since OP is paying for that phone and Ex is not paying for it NOR has he returned it as requested it is \"stolen\".", "This. She\u2019s not interfering, she\u2019s helping her son in a situation that was causing him stress. She didn\u2019t start it, she didn\u2019t step out of line. A parent shouldn\u2019t stop helping their kid at any age. If she had started this or taken it too far, sure I\u2019d understand these comments. But if he\u2019s sitting there explaining his stress over the situation and at a loss as to what to do, why shouldn\u2019t she help. \n\nTo take it further, not just with the gender disparity, but if it were his friend who started to get involved, I doubt there would be as much concern. Why does it matter who helped him? He needed someone else to have his back."]}
