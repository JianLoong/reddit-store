In October 2021, I decided to add my boyfriend at the time (45M) as a way to help him out as his service was not the best. We set up a cost for his phone which included the service and scheduled payments for the devices. We broke up in April 2022 but agreed to remain friends. During that time, he kept paying the phone bill with me sending him the pay schedule.\n\nAround November 2022, I noticed he would dodge some of my texts on the phone bill and he mentioned that he was going through a rough patch. I told him that I understood and not to ignore the text messages as that only makes things worse. December came where he said he could not pay after dodging my messages came again and I covered his part of the phone bill with informing him to pay me back.\n\nJanuary arrived and he said he was going to take care of it and pay me back. The due date of the phone bill came and I was getting charged for it. I told him to pay me 2 months of back pay plus current amount. He decided to ghost me. I got action as my mother texted him threatening legal action. He sent the money for February only with his promise to pay me back.\n\nBoth my mom and I reached out to him two weeks ago about paying for March with the two months of back pay. No response from him. We both mentioned legal action, turning off service, and declaring the devices stolen for non-payment. There was even an option of just returning the devices to me or my family, or setting up a payment plan. Still nothing.\n\nSo I decided to do one last thing. At 12:00, I wrote him a message stating that if he does not respond with any form of a resolution by 20:00, he will have all services turned off and all devices declared stolen. Eight hours came and went with no response. So I turned off all devices as I said I would and marked them stolen with my service provider.\n\nI thought I would sleep well but a part of my mind kept me up for part of the night making excuses for him.

You gave him many more chances than he deserved and cutting him off is way past due.", "Not going to say your ex is an asshole because we don't know what he's going through. It isn't right to put your head in the sand when you struggle to pay bills, but you know, money problems and mental health problems (they often go hand in hand) make people irrational, and dumb. However, you are definitely NTA. You gave your ex every chance to make this right or come to some sort of agreement. You acted in the only way you could (without giving the money up for lost, and you just don't owe him that). Sorry you were forced to take this action, OP. It sucks to be the bad guy, but you were right to be the bad guy.", "NTA. He tried to steal from you. Temporary problems happens but the least he can do is warn you and no ghost you.", "NTA. You have him plenty of opportunities.\n\nI do have to wonder why a 40 year old man is getting his mom involved in this though??", "NTA you tried and tried,  you were incredibly gracious about it in fact.", "NTA but this isn't even a suitable post because there's no interpersonal drama. Nobody has accused anyone of being an asshole and nobody is upset with anyone. Unless maybe you're upset with him, but you don't come across as particularly upset.", "NTA, turning it off makes sense. What does he expect? You to cover his phone bill indefinitely?\n\n\nJust a side note, keep your mother out of it, though. Threatening legal action\u2026 is extremely unwise. It\u2019s the sort of thing best left to lawyers. Especially unwise if it\u2019s an empty threat. Threatening to sue can be a form of blackmail. \n\nI realize she\u2019s just trying to help,  it could very easily cause a court to dismiss your claim if it goes to small claims court.", "NTA - Grown ass 45 year old man can pay his own phone bill. Who are you, his parent? No. He had plenty of opportunities to be adult and he wasn't. \n\nYou gave him more chances than I would have, enjoy your newly found peace.", "NTA.\n\nIf anything, you were probably too lenient with him, I don't think you'll ever see any of that money back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is your mother involved in this?!??", "NTA\n\nYou gave notice, he promised to compensate but didn't. IF he drags his heels on all of this you are not required to continually subsidise him. Sack the asshole's service. Probably learned yourself a lesson not to take on other people's liabilities for yourself.", "NTA. You tried to be nice. Given more than one chance to pay. Did what was needed.", "NTA you\u2019re more understanding than me. It would have been done within 3 days of the first missed payment. Ex is just that. You owe him nothing. He\u2019ll figure it out.", "NTA, you're a good guy", "I disagree. It's prime asshole behaviour to duck/dodge/ghost someone you owe money to.\n\nI DGAF what a person's excuses are. If they owe money, they should communicate with the person they owe it to instead of shutting down communication. OH the irony that OP is providing the very means of communicating in the first place.\n\nEx is definitely an AH. OP is NOT the bad guy. That's shitty logic right there.", "Exactly how i would have put it myself. NTA op, and your mother is amazing for helping you out with this problem, its always lovely to have a supportive family", "To answer that, she brought it upon herself to get involved as she saw the anxiety of trying to figure everything out hitting me hard. At the time, I was barely 5 months sober and I was trying not to fall into old habits that would threaten my sobriety. That's why she volunteered herself to help me out.", "Agree. It's incredibly easy to send a quick text \"hey I don't have what I owe you at this moment, can we work out a new date to pay?\"", "This doesn\u2019t explain why a 40 yo man gets his mother involved\u2026", "That made me cringe. Mom is way too involved in OPs life."]}
