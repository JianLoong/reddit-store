He was massively enabled in his life by my parents and lived for nearly 50 years just getting by with zero ambition and living rent free. A couple years before my mom passed away, my brother lived with me and did all the same things you did. At first I fell for the idea of having him do housework for a temporary stay, but then it turned into a long term stay with lots of entitlement and excuses.\n\nMy bad too for not realizing I too was enabling in the long run but I'm glad that I put my personal boundaries up when I told him he had to leave.

Assuming the room and board is worth about $1000 a monthly you\u2019re paying like $12 an hour for manual labor. He could make more working fast food.

Otherwise, he is just a slave for you.\n\nBut, of course, he is a bum, too.", "\"You can move back in but we'd have to charge you for rent and food. You didn't have to pay for that last time and it made you miserable, so we wouldn't want to go through that again.\"", "Uh, brother is also an AH. Just bc mom was trying to interfere doesn't mean he had to let her do so. Assuming he has a functioning brain, he is responsible for his own choices.", "OP has stated they could rent out the room for $1,400", "You are not wrong. People just can\u2019t read. They keep repeating the $1400 is total rent mistake when (now I\u2019ve got to your actual comment) it\u2019s the average rent for a room. Your brother had a heated home, a private room, was fed and had their Internet in exchange for 20 hours of labouring a week, and the freedom to take on other work as desired for any other needs. That\u2019s a bargain in a high cost of living area. \n\nHe wants to return, which is an acknowledgment that it was a good deal. I think he\u2019s just got sticker shock at the idea of actually having to do a job elsewhere to pay for himself and is likely kicking himself at letting your mom get in his head.", "Sounds like situation worked out perfectly.", "Where do you live that you think $334 is too much for gas, water, electrics, internet and groceries?! Our gas and electric alone was \u00a3400 in December. Our groceries alone are \u00a3100 a week, let alone a month. That\u2019s not including water and internet. \n\nYour area costs less than mine. Op\u2019s cost is different (possibly) to both. In either case op\u2019s brother wanted to return so plainly has worked out that he wasn\u2019t getting ripped off. I think your understanding of how much things cost is flawed. Bringing up market rent is also pointless given they have bought the home. Op\u2019s brother agreed that his 20 hour handyman contribution was worth the roof over his head, food on the table and all utilities taken care of. He wants spending money, he goes out and works a shift a week somewhere else. \n\nOp\u2019s brother could, and should, have got a part time job for his pocket money. \n\nAlso, to add to another of your comments below, how on earth do you equate a monthly rent of $1400 being for an entire apartment, (which given the mortgage is $3.600 I press the doubt button on) then calculate that op\u2019s brothers share is $466, and a breath later deride op for charging an apartments rent for a room? Your thinking seems to be somewhat twisted. Are you living at home by any chance? You sound like a 20 year old who\u2019s angry because mom has asked for rent, and therefore you are overly sensitive to others you perceive to be in a similar situation.", "NTA \n\nNot by far. Your brother is a weasel. You did exactly what needed to be done. Good for you and your partner.\n\nI'm wondering if Mom regrets giving such shit advice?", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.

There are certainly types of 20-hour schedules which are difficult to work at anything else around. For example, school bus drivers' schedule: 8am-10am and then 2pm-4pm five days a week. Famously difficult to get any other job with, because by the time you get away to your other job and then back again, you can spend a maximum of two and a half hours at a stretch actually working.", "I know, AITA? :-)\n\nAnd you are right. I have no defence, other than to say when an AH is such an outstanding AH that everything they touch turns to shit then the only possible verdict is 'YTA'.", "He was probably midway through setting up his man cave in the little brother\u2019s room.
