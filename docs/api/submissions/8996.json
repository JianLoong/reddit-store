He was massively enabled in his life by my parents and lived for nearly 50 years just getting by with zero ambition and living rent free. A couple years before my mom passed away, my brother lived with me and did all the same things you did. At first I fell for the idea of having him do housework for a temporary stay, but then it turned into a long term stay with lots of entitlement and excuses.\n\nMy bad too for not realizing I too was enabling in the long run but I'm glad that I put my personal boundaries up when I told him he had to leave.

That bot is amazing and makes me correct myself and now I'm getting a lot better with not making this mistake. It's a great bot!", "Would a contractor be trained, experienced, have his own tools, and not drink my beer while he worked?", "Can he buy his own food and pay for his own internet?", "Which just means it's good the brother left such an unjust, exploitative situation, and OP was right to release him from his enslavement.", "It's much more detrimental to coddle him and that seems like a reasonable deal.", "Etcetera, not \"ecksetera\".", "It is! I can see the confusion for non native speakers, you pay someone, and *normally* you add \"ed\" on the end for past tense, so you'd get payed if you follow the typical rule. But paid is actually the correct one, it's why I love the bot so much, it corrects you nicely and explains the meaning of both words. The could of etc instead of could have bot is a little less nice from what I remember as it just says the correction, and doesn't explain, which is a little less accessible to non native speakers", "YTA - \"my dropout brother\" this comment alone makes you AH, just because someone didn't finish university, doesn't make him less than you! \nAlso I thought you took brother to help him stand on his feet, but not, you gave him food and roof with working 20 hours a week, YTA! That's not helping that's making your brother working for you for food and roof. I see all this NTA. But there's is nothing altruistic in your behavior. I d never do this to my brothers! YTA", "Again, in your original post, you claim that you were happy with the work and that he did a good job, so none of that is relevant at all. Clearly he had the training and experience necessary to do the job well, that\u2019s it. \n\nTake responsibility for your behavior. Stop deflecting with these BS statements, obviously if you let your brother drink your beer while doing the work, you were fine with it at the time and just are looking to denigrate him now. I\u2019m not fooled.", "You're*", "Never mind. If you want to enslave your own brother, just go forward. I'm out", "and just makes op an ah", "It\u2019s \u201cEt cetera\u201d - two words from the Latin. It means \u201cand (et) the rest (cetera)\u201d. It is sometimes shown as one word in some dictionaries, but it should be two.", "I never stumbled on the could bot but nice!! Could of drives me nuts though nowhere near as much as alot together. Weird pet peeves I know. But this one is so nice and I agree that the explanation is a nice feat. \n\nAnd exactly. You don't have the same impulse to treat pay as an irregular verb versus say. To Be. So it feels natural to non-native speakers to just splat the -ed ending hehe.", "My partner and I both have FULL TIME JOBS and then we put in almost 35 hours a week on the house.", "LoL.  A studio apartment here is over three grand a month son. Plus utilities. Plus food.", "Everyone seems to agree with you", "Oh you want me to subsidize his life with the money I make at work."]}
