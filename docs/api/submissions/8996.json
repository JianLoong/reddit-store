He was massively enabled in his life by my parents and lived for nearly 50 years just getting by with zero ambition and living rent free. A couple years before my mom passed away, my brother lived with me and did all the same things you did. At first I fell for the idea of having him do housework for a temporary stay, but then it turned into a long term stay with lots of entitlement and excuses.\n\nMy bad too for not realizing I too was enabling in the long run but I'm glad that I put my personal boundaries up when I told him he had to leave.

I said well, if you can do it better, you clean.  She asked if we would pay her and I said, nothing.

How are other chores divided otherwise, and do normal household chores count in the 20hrs / week? does he do his fair share of cooking and cleaning in addition? Seems there might be a miscalculation on his and others ends about what constitutes as work earning room and board versus a chore he should be contributing to regardless that may be causing some conflict as far as what constitutes a fair deal. If its 20hrs total including his fair share of chores, that's nothing. If it's 20hrs of what I would consider actual work (ie home improvement tasks) + chores I can see how that is possibly more than rent value and a shitty deal for him. \n\nI'm leaning towards NAH regardless though. You're within your rights to refuse a different offer; he's within his rights to not think it's a good deal for him and to try to renegotiate. It doesn't sound like anyone did anything wrong here, he's just a bit immature and needs life experience to understand why he actually probably had a good deal happenjng. Imo It might have been a bit of an overreaction to throw him out depending on how quickly you told him to pack up simply for bringing this up though, generally at least a month or more is standard for throwing someone out and often legally required. Maybe not a big deal because he went back to other family but I'd probably feel bad about that part of the equation and want to give him some time, especially if all he did was bring this up and try to explain his side.

In my area cost of getting someone to do something like painting would be 15-20 an hour. He's you're brother so we're paying him decently so 20 an hour. 20 hours a week, we get about 1600 a month. In my area a room would rent for 600 to 700 plus maybe 200 for utilities. Since I assume you arnt buying groceries just for him adding an extra person usually costs less than buying for a single person alone so let's say 400 a month for food. Meaning the value of what you gave would be 1200ish a month and he gave you 1600. That would make him underpaid by 100 a week, but if rooms rent for 1400 in your area then you were actually giving him a discount of 100ish a week.
