And I am not surprised. The Japanese take safety VERY seriously, China not so much.", "Yes, and several other countries were on scene in Japan making sure that the water was at a safe level, to release it into the ocean.  The only people overseeing China is China.", "Actual Norwegian here. I\u2019m speechless! This will be my favorite question shopping our national dish from now on - how can i be sure this fish is not, in fact, Japanese?!!!!\n\nYour dear sister sounds both uninformed and anxious. Which will lead to distress no matter what. Your dish sounds delish btw, hope he liked it! NTA", "I\u2019m sorry I cannot get over the Norwegian black market Japanese salmon", "NTA. You sister is delusional if she thinks that the Norwegians would buy fish from somewhere else and resell it.\n\nThe thing about Japanese fish being bad BC the controlled release of water from Fukushima is bs. \n\nThe Chinese are fishing in Japanese water and that fish is apparently fine, just not ones that where caught by Japanese people. And China is also releasing way more from their plants that are far more dangerous.", "I mean how does she know the supermarkets don\u2019t lie to you about anything?", "Fukushima paranoia notwithstanding, Norway is the world\u2019s largest salmon exporter, accounting for almost 50% of global salmon exports.  Japan is not even in the top 15.  The country in the 15th position, Germany, accounts for less than 0.5% of global exports.\n\nThe Japanese salmon fishery is almost entirely for the domestic market.

And that literally billions of people have been eating salmon from Japan and elsewhere in the world? Does she really think a stray bit of radiation from an accident more than ten years ago is going to jump into a fish that you then happen to buy and feed to her Precious Baby?\n\nYour recipe sounds lovely, BTW; I usually use dill and white wine, but I\u2019m going to try garlic butter next time.", "NTA.

If he did, maybe she doesn't like it or doesn't like preparing it and she's not upset he might ask for it.  \n\nOne of my aunties was mad at my parents about that when they watched my little cousins while she went on a trip.
