They just toss the resumes with suspect names in the trash, and fail to offer opportunities that would have otherwise been offered.\n\nBut the worst racists are the racists that do not know they are racists, the ones that are not even aware of their own biases.\n\nWith no other information, it really looks like this is a racism problem.

Later on are you going to look at your daughter and say, \u201chey I know you\u2019ve never met your grandparents because they don\u2019t care about you but I\u2019m gonna go spend time with them because they mean more to me than you.\u201d You\u2019re gonna lose your wife and child but hey I guess mommy is more important.", "You took sides. \n\nAnd it wasn't your partners and child's side. \n\nYTA", "YTA you and your horrible family are flat out racist. You are purposely undermining your fiance. You are not setting boundaries. You are not doing anything to ensure your daughter grows up feeling loved and accepted by her extended family. You have responsibilities now. It is time to grow up, put your parents on the back burner and put your daughter first. Stop letting your family disrespect your daughter and your fiance.", "YTA.

I'll tell you now OP. Your partner will only put up with this for so long before she walks. Sit yourself down and answer the following question, honestly. How would you be feeling if it was HER parents treating YOU like this? They talk horribly about her, they refuse to meet her OR your daughter and YOU ARE ALLOWING THIS? Not just allowing it, condoning it.", "YTA", "YTA\nYour mom threatening to have ur \u201cfam\u201d disown u if u don\u2019t spend the night? Manipulation.

Do you expect racism to look like klan rallies and cross burnings? Your parents don't have to call your girlfriend a slur to know what racism looks like cause believe it or not she has experienced it explicitly or in microaggression her entire life. Your daughter is white passing now but as she gets older she very well could become darker skinned. You are tacitly racist as well and it also seems like you're with your gf involuntarily. Do all of you a favor and break up. You need to grow up and be better for your kid and your parents need to just grow into better people.", "YTA and a TERRIBLE husband and father.

You have said your wife loves to talk about racism. Have you ever considered it\u2019s because of things she\u2019s experienced and she needs to vent, talk about and try to make you understand what she\u2019s gone through?   \n\n\nYou need to grow up and get your priorities straight.

If you can\u2019t be man enough to stand up for your wife. You don\u2019t deserve to be with her!\nIf someone disrespected my partner, I would be the first one getting involved regardless of family or not. I hope your wife gives a lot of thought about her own future with you. Yes you are the biggest ass possible.", "YTA, immature, and oblivious. Your parents are racist based on all the commentary. If you haven\u2019t heard them called it before it\u2019s likely because their friends and family are racist as well. Them refusing to be near your partner and not even meet your daughter is disgusting. You choosing them first over your partner and daughter is more disgusting. \n\nShe\u2019s probably better off without you. I\u2019m not seeing what you contribute to the relationship. Perhaps finances.", "YTA", "YTA when you commit to someone and have a baby with them, they become your immediate family and your parents become extended family. Your immediate family comes first. Have you ever asked them what their problem is with her? If I were in your shoes I\u2019d tell my parents that we are a package deal and if they don\u2019t like it they not only lose me but also their grandchild.

What kind of a man/woman puts up with their own parents treating their child like crap. Friend. Forget the fianc\u00e9. They hate your own flesh and blood. How much worse does it have to get?

You had a choice, sir.  You could have chosen to put on your big boy pants, support your partner and the mother of your child, and told your parents in no uncertain terms that unless they behave civilly toward your fiancee and child, accepting that they are now your family, you will go NC.  But no, you love them too much to show respect for your fiancee or concern for your child.", "YTA\n\nYour parents sound like toxic people. \n\nRather than be the bigger person and move past some ridiculous grudge they have against your fianc\u00e9 they would rather not meet your child. \n\nAnd then you, rather than prioritising your child you back down to your controlling parents who would talk shit about you and turn your family against you if they didn\u2019t get their own way. \n\nIn the nicest way possible grow a back bone.
