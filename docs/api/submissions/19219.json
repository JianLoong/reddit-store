This is something we both do and I got back home around 6:30 AM. I scheduled a Walmart order for 7-8 but it wasn\u2019t ready yet. I left the house to get it around 7:10. Husband 30M still asleep. I complete pick up at 7:18 and get back around 7:25. My husband texted me to bring him a towel when I got back which I didn\u2019t see at 7:22. I put away the groceries and decided to scroll tiktok before I clocked in to my work from home job at 8. My husband got out of the shower pissed off and says, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see my texts?\u201d I reply no. Looked and saw the one from 7:22 asking for a towel and another at 7:39 asking where am I. Keep in mind he was still in the bathroom and I was on our bed laying down. I went and got him a towel but he was pissed because I was going to make him late. He said that it would have worked out perfectly if I had brought him a towel but now he\u2019s going to be late. I don\u2019t understand how my bringing him a towel would have made him not late and told him (I might be an AH for this) \u201cI am not responsible for your mismanagement of your time and you decided to take a shower when you didn\u2019t have the time. Your late because of your choices\u201c this has upset him and he blames me for the whole thing. He didn\u2019t actual leave the house until 7:52 and it takes 21 mins for him to get to work. I got back in plenty of time for him to make it to work but he was in the shower. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m at fault. So AITA?\n\nUpdate: Small clarification. The clean laundry was in a basket in the kitchen and that bathroom was out of towels. He would have had to walk through the living room (where my mother in law was ) naked.

Here's how an ADULT would handle that. Sends you a text, waits a couple of minutes, realizes you must not have seen it, gets out of the shower, gets a towel, goes to work like a grown-ass man. The End.", "NTA - He sat in the bathroom for more than 15 minutes after getting out of the shower just waiting for you to get him a towel? In his own home? Why didn't he just put whatever he wore into the bathroom back on so he could go get a towel? Especially if he was going to be late? Or call you? Or just use his voice and call out to you from the bathroom? \n\nIt honestly sounds like he created a situation that he could blame you for just for the sake of being angry at you.", "NTA. Did he just stand there for 20 minutes waiting for a towel to magically fly through the air to him? Could he not figure out that his legs are capable of walking to get a towel? In what world did he come to the conclusion that this was your fault?", "NTA. If he was so late and you weren't replying to texts, why didn't he just step out naked. Didn't this happen at home?:", "I am just bewildered by these sorts of relationships, honestly.", "NTA. He could have opened the door and given a shout if he wasn't getting a response, or checked for towels before he got in the shower. He had many options other than just standing around waiting for you to look at your phone and expecting you to be at his beck and call.", "NTA. I mean, who doesn\u2019t check for a towel before they step into the shower. \n\nBlaming you for his fiasco puts him into weaponized incompetence territory", "NTA, he could have just yelled for a towel so you or MIL could have gotten it for him. Or been an adult in the first place and made sure there was a towel for him BEFORE he got into the shower!", "NTA\n\nOk, so it was a simple mistake that he forgot to take a towel with him, but it's still his mistake. When it became clear you didn't get the first message, he could have called you, or shouted from the bathroom door. But no, as soon as he forgot the towel it became your problem/fault - wtf?\n\nYou'd already been to get MIL and pick up the shopping. Ensuring your husband is ready for work shouldn't also have to be part of your morning routine.", "NTA??? Why didn't he just call???", "Nta - don't TEXT important things. Use the CALL option. Ugh.", "NTA\n\nHe should've checked to see if he had a towel before showering. Were there other people's towels hanging up in the bathroom? If so, he could've used someone else's towel.\n\nAnd why didn't he call you if you weren't responding?", "NTA\n\nI don't know why *he* couldn't have got a towel himself? We've all been in a situation where we need to do a mad naked dash to get a towel lol. It's not a big deal.\n\nThe only question I have is how you didn't see his messages when you were laying on your bed scrolling tiktok - therefore you were on your phone.", "Nta...he had his phone..why couldn't he CALL you if he didn't want to track water across the room?   You'd hear a ring before a text... AND if you were literally in bed..why couldn't he just shout?", "LMAO! Sounds like the house has two mothers in it.", "NTA - he found an alternative solution (sheet) that he could have used right from the start.  Maybe next time he should make sure there's a towel in the bathroom BEFORE taking a shower.\n\nETA - what would he have done if you hadn't been at the house?  What if you left at 7:30 to get the Walmart order and weren't there?", "Your husband reminds me of my kids: 8 and 5: \nMe: \"<name of the kid>, why are you still naked? What don't you have your underwear on?\nKid: i haven't got any left in my box\nMe: why didn't you tell me before?/or/ why don't you wall to get one in the machine(they know they can do it)/or/ okay but why didn't you put your tshirt on while asking me for one...instead of sitting there on the couch?\n\nNta...but you have another kid at home!", "NTA \n\nWTAF he's a grown ass adult he can get his own towel!  Most people get a towel before going to get in the shower.\n\nYour hubby is an AH for blaming you", "NTA but I'm somewhat confused. It says that your husband is 30 but he sounds like 5, you are sure its not your kids we are talking about?", "Or he could have walked to the door and asked his mom to get him a towel. It's his mom, right?", "NTA he could have grabbed a towel BEFORE getting in the shower. He could have woke up earlier. He could have folded the towels and put them away the night before. So many things he could have done to make his morning easier.", "Why didn't he pull out a towel before he got in the shower? Or ask his mom to get him one? \n\n>When he got out initial, he grabbed a sheet from the hall closet to start drying off with while I went to get him a towel which his petty butt didn\u2019t even bother using.\n\nSo be solved it? This is all on him. NTA.", "Maybe he should keep a robe in the bathroom or bring it in with him.  Maybe he should think ahead and not expect his wife to bring him things he's old enough to remember himself.  All the stuff about the time and being late is irrelevant; the point is that if he's old enough to shower by himself he's old enough to remember a towel.", "INFO: how often does your husband do juvenile shit like this? \n\nWhatever the answer is, you\u2019re NTA but is this a pattern with him?", "NTA\n\nLet's see so far this morning you got up, got dressed, drove to pick up MIL, drove home, went back out to retrieve a pick up order, drove back home, unloaded and put up groceries,  scrolled TikTok, retrieved a towel for your fully capable adult husband, listened to him complain about your neglecting his need for a towel, got blamed for preventing him arriving to work on time all before you clocked in to your job at 8am? \n\nUmmm.....what did I just read???", "NTA\n\nYou:\n\n>I put away the groceries and decided to scroll tiktok before I clocked in to my work from home job at 8\n\nSo you didn't see the texts while you were on your phone...? I dont consider that to be an excuse for not seeing it tbh. Just read your comment about sleep focus so changing verdict from ESH to NTA. But maybe you should change it to your actual sleep schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPartner:\n\nRelying on someone bringing you towel to not make you late for work doesnt make sense to me was he waiting in the shower for you to bring you a towel. I've forgotten a towel in the shower before and its a case of poking my head out of the bathroom to see if the coast is clear. Then loudly announce I am walking naked to get my towel.", "NTA your rational is reasonable. If he wanted a, shower he should have gotten up earlier. There is so much you did before he got his butt out of bed. Men can be so exhausting.\n\nAlso your MIL *is his mother* my god she's not gonna be embarrassed by his bare ass.", "How is it your fault that he did not prepare enough for his shower, by checking for towels? NTA.\n\nAlso wondering how he can text, but not yell...", "Is he a \"never nude\"? \n\nHe needs to grow up! NTA", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t he put a robe on?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she gets shut in somewhere accidentally she will just lie there and wait for someone to find her. Doesn't think to bark!   She was shut in my ensuite for about an hour and I started calling for her as I thought she was with my son. Nope she was 2meters away from me and still didn't bark when I was calling for her.

As I said previously you are NTA because I am unsure why a grown adult couldn't go and get a towel himself - yes it could be embarrassing if someone catches you naked but it's his own house, right? We've all done a mad naked dash in our home before. He is being silly and looking for someone to blame.", "All good points I\u2019m going to bring up when he gets home", "I'm so baffled he didn't just stick his head out of the bathroom and kind of shout to get someone's attention if he so desperately needed someone *else* to bring him a towel.\n\nMy family would do this all the time when I was growing up.
