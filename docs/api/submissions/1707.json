Do you think, if sister has spoken about this with BIL, that he *wouldn't* be suspicious that OP suddenly wants to atop the lessons? And that wouldn't cause more issues between him and his wife?\n\n>But, personally, I would see sister's appeal as a cry for help. Clearly, she and BIL are having issues\n\nExcept it isn't actually clear, is it? They're once a week lessons, so it's not like he's spending all his time with OP now. Frankly, we don't know enough about the situation to decide whether sister has a legitimate reason to complain or is just being irrationally jealous. We don't know how much time BIL spends with his family outside of these lessons, which is the key issue here, according to the sister herself. \n\nWe can't make any accurate judgments on the sister's complaint without knowing if BIL is neglecting his family or not. \n\n>Does it take the whole day, from marketing to prepping to cooking to tasting? If so, OP should feel bad about interfering with BIL's time to spend with his CHILDREN.)\n\nWhy do you say that as though BIL isn't a grown man who makes the choice himself to spend time where he wants? It also seems a bit shortsighted; clearly BIL is very invested in this, so who's to say if OP hadn't agreed, he wouldn't be taking up professional cooking lessons instead?

Even if it was time away from just his wife it's no different.\" Exactly.\n\nEdit to add: Had to reread OP's post. So OP and BIL aren't particularly close. She found BIL's request for cooking lessons strange but OP agreed to teach BIL because OP didnt want to feel awkward by saying \"No\" .\n\nSo now it's become more than awkward since Sister is making a big issue out of it with family. \n\nAgain, it's not OP's responsibility to fix sister and BIL's issue. But empathy is also needed. \n\nAdditionally, some self preservation on the part of Op might be considered. Is she unwittingly being the distraction in a bad marriage? Does she even want that role? Will she be losing something if she compromises with BIL by reducing time spent with BIL,  or removes herself from something that has the potential of blowing up in her face?\n\nGranted she is innocent of anything implied by the sister, but does that mean OP should throw caution to the wind and pretend that sister is not being driven by jealousy.

It's never \"the other person's\" responsibility, even if he was full on having an affair, the only person the wife should be upset with and talking to is her husband.", "\"As I said.
