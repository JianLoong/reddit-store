You should apologize for being insensitive while still standing your ground on principle. Your friend is being sexist and generous on your behalf.", "Make her text it to you, then show him the text. You're NTA She's clearly jealous. But I totally get what you don't want to say that it makes you uncomfortable, first because it doesn't but also because it will make other things uncomfortable in the future If he thinks being around him is weirding you out! Drop this squarely back on her shoulders!", "Nta. Just tell your sister you are getting in the middle of whatever is going on between her and her husband. She wants him to stop to spend time with her and the kids, she can tell him. You will not act like a go between between she doesn't want to communicate with her husband. Like if you don't want to communicate with him, why should I?", "NTA. Tell him what your sister said to you.", "NTA.

Kids love being in the kitchen, and it would be a great bonding activity.", "NTA  I would tell the BIL right in front of her sister \"I have to stop teaching you how to cook because your wife says I have too.\" Then just leave.", "NTA.  Your sister\u2019s issue with her husband is exactly that, HER ISSUE.  If she has a problem, SHE needs to address it with him, not ask you to lie to him.", "NTA and by your sister's response no wonder the poor guy wants to get out of the house once a week. I do have to ask though if he has tried to get her to teach him to cook.", "NTA she needs to have this convo with husband not you or the rest of your fam. Bil request is a little odd though, &you found it odd too, so I'm not surprised your sis is insecure", "NTA. Discontinue the lessons but be upfront with him about the reason. No reason to have awkwardness with him for some she wanted.", "so\u2026 basically AITA for teaching my BIL a basic life skill that every functioning member of society should know in some capacity?\n\nalso it sounds that your sister is jealous that her husband went to you instead of her to learn how to cook.\n\nanyway NTA", "NTA\nYour sis is weird", "NTA. She's upset that he's spending ONE DAY a week trying to improve himself, probably to help her out at home? And he's doing it with a family member, for free, instead of taking a class?  Jesus, this sister sounds needy and paranoid.... unless there's some missing piece she's not shared with you, like he's cheated or lied to her before or something.  I think the big part is she's asking you to lie instead of telling HIM she doesn't like it. She probably would rather do that because she doesn't want to have to explain to him why she's uncomfortable.  Which is not your problem.", "I agree with this angle. I don't think BIL actually wants to learn to cook. I think he wants to spend time with his SIL.", "I think it has a lot to do with the BIL ask op and not his own wife.

There's nothing romantic, intimate, or sexual about teaching someone how to cook. \n\n>But we dont know that sister hasn't talked to BIL about this once a week lessons. \n\nIf she has already spoken to BIL about this, then it's *even more* an issue they need to deal with together and not something for OP to weigh in on. \n\nWhat do you think OP going along with what sister says is going to accomplish in that situation, anyway? Do you think, if sister has spoken about this with BIL, that he *wouldn't* be suspicious that OP suddenly wants to atop the lessons? And that wouldn't cause more issues between him and his wife?\n\n>But, personally, I would see sister's appeal as a cry for help. Clearly, she and BIL are having issues\n\nExcept it isn't actually clear, is it? They're once a week lessons, so it's not like he's spending all his time with OP now. Frankly, we don't know enough about the situation to decide whether sister has a legitimate reason to complain or is just being irrationally jealous. We don't know how much time BIL spends with his family outside of these lessons, which is the key issue here, according to the sister herself. \n\nWe can't make any accurate judgments on the sister's complaint without knowing if BIL is neglecting his family or not. \n\n>Does it take the whole day, from marketing to prepping to cooking to tasting? If so, OP should feel bad about interfering with BIL's time to spend with his CHILDREN.)\n\nWhy do you say that as though BIL isn't a grown man who makes the choice himself to spend time where he wants? It also seems a bit shortsighted; clearly BIL is very invested in this, so who's to say if OP hadn't agreed, he wouldn't be taking up professional cooking lessons instead? Or figuring it out on his own via YouTube or something?", "If it were my sister I\u2019d be bending over backwards to make her feel comfortable . Weird , that that isn\u2019t her first reaction .", "So your theory is that BIL is doing this, not because he actually wants to learn to cook, but in some bizarre (and pointless) ploy to blame OP for their marital issues later? Sure. \ud83d\ude44", "Nah but the kids do! Just do it when sister is at work or something lol", "Why does what the time he could have spent it with matter? Even if it was time away from just his wife it's no different. \n\nIf it's 12 hours, those are 12 hours where that he is volunteering on his own and is free to leave at any time. I don't see why it's fair to put anything on her for his actions simply because she has made herself available. He is fully autonomous and responsible for anything he does. \n\nSaying she should feel bad is saying she is somehow wrong for not policing another adult's time.", "\"Why does what the time he could have spent it with matter? Even if it was time away from just his wife it's no different.\" Exactly.\n\nEdit to add: Had to reread OP's post. So OP and BIL aren't particularly close. She found BIL's request for cooking lessons strange but OP agreed to teach BIL because OP didnt want to feel awkward by saying \"No\" .\n\nSo now it's become more than awkward since Sister is making a big issue out of it with family. \n\nAgain, it's not OP's responsibility to fix sister and BIL's issue. But empathy is also needed. \n\nAdditionally, some self preservation on the part of Op might be considered. Is she unwittingly being the distraction in a bad marriage? Does she even want that role? Will she be losing something if she compromises with BIL by reducing time spent with BIL,  or removes herself from something that has the potential of blowing up in her face?\n\nGranted she is innocent of anything implied by the sister, but does that mean OP should throw caution to the wind and pretend that sister is not being driven by jealousy. This is her sister talking, not just some random woman.\n\nAlso, would your opinion be the same if OP were just a friend, and not the woman's sister.", "As I said. If I'm in her place I'm telling the husband that my sister has a problem with it, and I don't want to be in the middle.\n\nAnd yes, my opinion is the same, man or woman, friend or family or stranger. It is no one's responsibility but the husband's to ensure he's spending his time correctly. It's never \"the other person's\" responsibility, even if he was full on having an affair, the only person the wife should be upset with and talking to is her husband.", "\"As I said. If I'm in her place I'm telling the husband that my sister has a problem with it, and I don't want to be in the middle.\" Again, exactly.\n\nWho wants to be the innocent party in the middle of a bad marriage? If OP had any sense in her, she should accept that she is better off distance herself from the BIL rather than be gossiped among family and friends that she is interested in BIL, even though this is not true."]}
