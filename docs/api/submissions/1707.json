What's up with that.", "NTA \n\nIf she has an issue with her husband she should talk to her husband, not put the burden on you.\n\nYour sister could offer to teach him to cook if she wanted to. Depending on the ages of the kids, they could even be part of the cooking lesson with either her or you, but she\u2019s the one who has to communicate with her husband not make you lie to him.", "NTA, You are teaching someone to cook, if someone else has an issue with it they can sort it amongst themselves. Maybe your sister is jelous?", "NTA. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s conflict-averse or what, but it\u2019s her marriage and if she wants him to spend his time differently it\u2019s on *her* to tell him so. It\u2019s not fair of her to demand that you lie for her and make yourself the bad guy so that she doesn\u2019t have to have an uncomfortable conversation with her husband.", "NTA.  Perfect to ask her to speak with him about it.  If she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019d go ahead and tell her that if she doesn\u2019t tell him that you will let him know that she is uncomfortable with you teaching him.", "Seems to me that sister feels insecure. \n\nA once a week cooking lesson with a family member shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nBut I recommend also reaching out to your sister (with a 3rd present so she can\u2019t twist the story) to find out why she can\u2019t speak to her own husband on how she feels about the situation.\n\nLike her relationship with her husband is not a healthy one and she is trying to drag you in. If she is that uncomfortable to speak with him, just tell the husband the truth. \n\n\u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t want me to teach you anymore, and I need to respect her wishes. Please learn to communicate with each other so you don\u2019t bring in other innocent people into your relationship problems.\u201d", "NTA! Why would you be an a-hole for teaching your BIL to cook?! It's a great skill to learn, especially if you're a parent, because he can then cook for his children and teach them cook. \n\nIf your sister have a problem with you and your BIL cooking together, then she should talk with both of you so that you can discuss it.", "NTA - is your sister incapable of having an adult conversation about this with her own husband?\n\nIf she wants to shit all over you to your family, return the favor and let them know what's actually going on.\n\nGood lord your sister has issues.", "NTA. If I were you, cut of all chances of this coming back on you. Next time you meet him, tell him. Make sure he's aware of what she said and what she's doing.", "NTA - this could have been a nice way for you and your BIL to get closer, but your sister is weird and ruining it.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not your job to manage marital communications between your sister and her husband. \n\nIf she can't do that, that's on her. \n\nI suspect there's other issues afoot here, likely jealousy on your sister's part - once a week lessons don't sound like they're taking too much time away from home, so I am guessing your sister's excuse is bullshit. \n\nI'm additionally guessing that your sister and her husband have already fought about this, which is why sister wants it to come from you and not her. \n\nIn any case, everyone involved here is a full-grown adult who should be able to use their words and decide things for themselves. This isn't your problem.", "Yea NTA. Your BIL came to you asking for cooking lessons and you agree. Technically speaking, you\u2019re his teacher now. As you\u2019re teacher, you don\u2019t have to tell anyone you don\u2019t want to teach them anymore UNLESS you yourself are uncomfortable teaching. Sisters a AH, and making bold accusations that aren\u2019t necessary. NTA", "Perhaps you should imply to your family that your sister is so terrible that her husband is literally trying to escape from her. \n\nBut really, it seems like there's more going on here. We don't know if the BIL is trying to make moves, or if he's trying to get away from his wife, or he doesn't want to be a parent.", "NTA for teaching him how to cook, it's a nice thing to do. I'd help my family members like that, too.\n\nBut why would your sister react that way and be so insecure? Some info is missing, I think...", "NTA\n\nwhat the heck? You're just helping him learn how to cook, which is a necessary skill! Your sister sounds really insecure. And she's taking it out on you. It was very rude of her to imply that you're trying to \"steal\" her husband! You're just trying to be a good person and help out!", "NTA, but could you give lessons at his house, with outcome of a delicious dinner for his family?", "Why does sister want you to do her dirty work?   I wonder if BIL is more interested in you than you realize.  In any case ... NTA", "Your brother in law goes to your house to learn? If so, better to do this in sister's house, right? So all of you can enjoy the benefits of his cooking lesson \n\nBut if he drops by your house, you teach him there, then eat what you two prepared just the two of you,  and you dont invite sister to taste what BIL cooked.....maybe you should move venue to his house.", "NTA. I agree with the commenters who suggest complete transparency with BIL and the rest of the family. Your sister is playing little mind games. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.", "NTA maybe invite kids and SIL for the meal afterwards? Sounds odd sister is jealous or something.", "NTA tell ur sister to hell him herself if she wants him to stop that bad", "NTA What a stupid request of her to bar your bil to teach a basic skill which can further increase their quality of life. And besides cooking doesn't take that long most of the time.", "NTA. This is a her problem, not a you problem. Your BIL asked you for help. If she has an issue with that then it\u2019s up to her to talk to her husband about it. Jeez, what\u2019s with all the insecure sisters on Reddit today?", "NTA", "NTA: but you should stop and explain to your BIL exactly why you are stopping. You did nothing wrong and should not start participating in a lie.", "I join with the others who wonder why she can't ask her husband to spend more time with her and the kids.\n\nBut I do note that your continuing on with these lessons, as if she had never said anything, is kind of dismissive of your sister and her concerns. I don't know what those concerns are or what else BIL is doing that keeps him away from his family, but she does have those worries and shouldn't be dismissed out of hand.\n\nHave you thought of talking to your student about what his wife told you?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Surely he\u2019s learned enough by now to start picking up cookery from recipes and Youtube.", "Wow NTA - your sister is an insecure AH. Maybe tell the bro-in-law what\u2019s going on and why you can\u2019t keep giving him lessons? Not sure really what\u2019s the best thing to do here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF your sister does not like it, SHE needs to speak to her husband.", "NTA.

Your sister needs to work on her insecurities. Is her husband's cooking now better than hers?", "NTA . I have 4 brothers and 1 sister and two of them have been in long term relationships and me I've been in a few myself. I would never distrust my sibling around my spouse, and it would actually make me super happy to see them bonding and I know my siblings feel the same about me. It really blows my mind how families get caught up like this. Nothing in my world is more important than the bonds I have with my family.", "NTA. But the whole thing is weird. Sounds like you are uncomfortable giving the lessons but also too uncomfortable to end them? But you are prioritizing the BIL feelings above yourself & your sister. A lot to unpack here\u2026 including why your sister is not comfortable talking to her husband but is comfortable telling the rest of your family that you\u2019re moving in on her husband.", "NTA but your sister and husband have issues. There shouldn't be anything wrong with him learning to cook. And if she has a problem with him why can't she go to him?", "ESH, you should have stopped when she told you how she felt it was taking time away from his family, and she should have told him herself", "She probably knows her husband will find this controlling, jealous and problematic.either because she knows it is on some level, or because she already tried and he told her he was going to continue anyway because her request is unreasonable.", "Info: does he go practice his cooking skills at home or just use up his family time learning from you when he should be parenting?", "YTA bc you're getting set up by both of them and you don't even realise it. Stop the lessons immediately before it gets messier", "NTA your sister needs to talk to her own husband\u2026", "NTA, but is there a way you could cook with him in their kitchen? Depending on how old the kids are, they could help too. Alternatively, tell him he's made such progress that you're smply goimg to supply him with recipes every week. Your sister is being unreasonable to you, but there could be issues in her life you're not aware of causing her to react this way. It's completely your call, do whatever you're comfortable with - after all, you didn't volunteer your servises in the first place.", "NTA. If you want to try to pacify your sister, I could see moving the cooking lesson to their house. But that's the furthest I would go.", "NTA- and also, this is kind of easy.  Just tell her this... You tell your husband that you don't want him doing this or I will. I have no reason to lie to anybody and I won't be part of anybody else's lies, either. If you can't own your reasons for wanting him to stop enough to voice them to him, that's not on me, but be very damn careful before you infer even once more that I am after your husband or we're gonna have a schism in this family.", "NTA.  First, if he learns to cook, wouldn\u2019t that facilitate more time with his family as he takes what he learns and cooks for them?  And second - your sister is an adult, presumably.  If she has an issue she can take it up with her husband herself.", "NTA. Something wrong with your sister. She needs to get her jealousy in check.", "It\u2019s a shame that your sister has made this very awkward and weird when it\u2019s just an innocent way for you to bond with your BIL and impart some knowledge to him.  I\u2019d just straight up tell him that your sister doesn\u2019t want the lessons to continue and end them, but maybe recommend a few cookbooks he can try out on his own.  I\u2019ve been cooking for 25 years, I\u2019d actually love to teach a family member how to cook, but no one is interested.", "NTA. And Tell your sister, she can came at the same clases, that way, they can have this time together aswell.", "Husband didn't ask her to teach him to cook, this implys she isn't very good at cooking or teaching to cook. She is probably just jealous or somthing. NTA", "She\u2019s butt hurt because he wanted to learn from OP because he likes OP\u2019s food and not his own wife\u2019s food probably."]}
