I have a brother \"Chris\" (14M) who has extremely severe autism. He needs a lot of support with his everyday needs. He gets frustrated and unfortunately as he's got older he has started to lash out physically at the people around him. \n\nWhen I was little I got on with my mom OK but as a teenager we had a lot of arguments. A lot of it had to do with my stepdad wanting to have the authority of a father over me and me never really accepting that. But I also got pushed to the side a lot as all the focus went on looking after my brother and that made me angry. I admit I became a bit of a tearaway, drinking, not getting back until early hours of the morning. \n\nWhen I was 17 my mom sent me to one of those residential schools for troubled kids (literally like you see on sh\\*tty daytime TV shows which I'm pretty sure is where she got the idea). I had no idea it was going to happen and the school sent two members of staff to get me out of bed in the middle of the night.\n\nI was there for six months. It was pretty hellish, like a military-style thing with morning inspections and sad middle aged men in silly uniforms barking orders at children. I was allowed a call from my mom one a week after the first month but I never took them. She also wrote me a few letters but I never read them. When I turned 18 they couldn't legally keep me there and the plan was for my mom to come and pick me up but I decided on my 18th birthday just to leave myself. The school threw an absolute fit, tried to call my mom, told me I was being irresponsible but I told them to f\\*ck off. It was a bit difficult because I didn't have any money or a phone and the school was pretty rural but I managed to borrow a phone and call a friend who came to pick me up. \n\nI moved around between friends for a bit but I'm pretty well set up now. I blocked my mom on everything and pretty much made sure she couldn't get in touch with me. The other thing that happened when I turned 18 was that a fund my dad set up for me when I was born became accessible. There is now a lot of money in it. I mean a LOT. My brother has a fund too but I don't think anyone can get into it until he's 18. \n\nRecently my step-aunt reached out to me out of the blue to say that my mom and stepdad have been really struggling financially with Chris's care costs especially now he is getting older and more difficult for mom to control. And she said my mom was sorry about the way things happened between us and wanted me to come home. I said I wasn't interested in being part of the family now just because she needed my money. My aunt said that was cruel and that I had only ever made things more difficult for my mom. \n\nI feel a bit guilty about Chris especially because we used to be close and I was good at calming him down.

You finally escaped. Block the aunt too.", "NTA. You have made your line in the sand pretty clear. I notice that your step aunt only reached out when your parents need money. Not when there was an angry, hurting teenager bouncing from friend to friend. You were a lot more vulnerable that they are.\n\nIf you give up your money to help your brother, they won't repay it as his needs will always be greater in their eyes. Use it to get set, get qualified,get a secure life. They will get his trust in three years and may be able to make a case to obtain early due to medical needs. Best thing you can do for your brother is be secure in future if and when he needs support as your parents age. You're not stable in your life yet.\n\nAlso get counselling or therapy.

If you were good at calming him, then she should have gone out of her way to praise you for that and to recognize the sacrifices you made for him daily growing up. Instead she sent you away so she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with you, robbing you of any parental help as a teenager. Your mom neglected you severely, and now you need to raise yourself as an adult. You have plenty to deal with already. You don\u2019t need to take ownership of their problems, too.\n\nYou did not give birth to your brother; it was not your decision to take on that responsibility.\n\nI hope you can maintain a relationship with your brother someday, despite everything that happened with your mom, but you need to take care of yourself first.

Do not let your family use you after they sent you away like trash. I understand it must've been hard on your mom to deal with your brothers issues and you \"acting out\" but did she ever stop to ask why you were acting that way? If you were okay? All her focus was on your brother and she ignored you because you're the \"healthy\" child (that's literally a form of child abuse).\nIf your mom really cared, she would've tried to reach out to you long ago, not through your aunt saying they need money.", "Absolutely NTA. That money is yours and yours only. Your brother\u2019s care is not your responsibility in any way, shape or form, it is HERS.

If it\u2019s as much money as I\u2019m imagining ($250k+), and you use it wisely, it can mean a solidly comfortable, easier life for the rest of your life. This opens up so many opportunities for you, and I seriously beg of you to hire a professional for handling it. If I had gotten a huge windfall at your age I\u2019m sure I would have spent it extremely stupidly. I\u2019m not saying you will, but a financial advisor can help you get set up (potentially for life), and still put aside some money to go a little crazy with. Use this money to live the best-possible life.", "Ahaha no way NTA\n\nBeing a sibling of a disabled person can be literal hell. You weren't a troubled kid you were pushed aside and ignored.\n\nAnd now your parents want you to \"step up\" where were they??

Sounds like you're a hard worker!", "NTA. Your brother is not your responsibility and you also need help becoming an adult.  This money won't make up for all the neglect you've suffered, but it's a start.", "NTA. You\u2019re not financially responsible for your brother and you\u2019re not obligated to help. Additionally, good for you for setting a hard boundary between yourself and your parents. Those camps are traumatic and abusive and you are justified in cutting your parents out. You can use that money for college, a house, a business, anything that you want to do with your life, and you should use it. Don\u2019t feel guilty. They hurt you when they were supposed to protect and provide for you and now they have to deal with the consequences of their actions.", "NTA. You family doesn't deserve a penny from you.

I don\u2019t know you, but I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone anything. Your dad left that money for you - not for anyone else. Seems like it came at just the right time, too.

You are not his parent.", "NTA. \n\nIf they are so concerned about your mom needing help tell them they can donate to her cause.", "> My aunt said that was cruel and that I had only ever made things more difficult for my mom.\n\nThen that sounds like a great reason for you to stay away from your mom and the situation she is dealing with. Wouldn't want to make things more difficult, would you?\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're already a legal adult (in most places) with a life ahead of you, and you definitely got a bad deal with your mom.\n\n~~If you wanna send them some money one single time to \"help\" with your brother, go ahead, but~~ don't get sucked into being your brother's caretaker.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nIf your family is in the US, your mother should get Social Security survivors payments for your brother, he also probably qualifies for Disability payments and/or support.  If he's Disabled, your brother probably qualifies for state medical insurance, services and accomodations to meet his specific needs through the school system, and other state programs and support (such as respite care) through the state.  Caring for your brother may be very challenging, but there are resources that should be helping significantly with the financial burden.  \n\nSo, absolutely don't feel like the family who could afford private boarding school (even crappy ones aren't cheap) should have one penny of your money.  I doubt any of the money would be used to improve your brother's situation.  Based on how poorly they cared for you, your mother and stepfather probably aren't great at parenting.\n\nIf you suspect your brother's needs aren't being met, you might consider contacting CPS to ask them to perform a wellness check.  They would check to see if your brother is being properly cared for and might be able to advise your mother and stepfather regarding programs to help them.", "NTA.  Ultimately you are not responsible for supporting your mother, your brother, or your step father and for your aunt to try to manipulate you is garbage.", "NTA but be aware, your mother is trapped. She refused to do what your little brother needed as a small child, and now she is reaching out to receive protection from herself, because she still needs a professional to take over the care of the autistic troubled teen.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t even involved, not because of the past and her bad decision of placing you in a care system, but because she put the wrong child into care, and now that you have the opportunity to build your own future, that\u2019s what you need to focus on.\n\nYou should be using your time and resources on your future. Please don\u2019t think you have a successful future because your past was difficult or that you were wronged. Instead, make sure you realize you need to protect yourself against your own potential bad decisions that can ruin your life like your mother has ruined her future.", "Definitely NTA. You owe them absolutely no money and should not feel pressured into helping them unless you make that decision for yourself. Your father left that money FOR YOU, not anyone else. You have every right to maintain no contact with them.", "NTA at all. Why doesn't your mom & stepfather send your brother to a residential school?\n\nLikely completely true that they will try to get as much money from you as possible. Nope. That was set up for YOU. Not them.", "NTA-", "NTA. \n\nThe money being held for your brother can be used for his care before he turns 18. Your mother needs a lawyer to prepare the appropriate paperwork to request the money.\n\nKeep your money for your future. Your mother and stepfather have taken enough from you. Block them all and live your life for yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou nailed it with your response to your aunt. They want you to come home with your fund money just as they are struggling? OF COURSE THEY DO.\n\nYou feel guilty about Chris because you\u2019re a good person who loves your brother. Don\u2019t let them turn your feelings about your brother into a weapon they can use against you. And remember, they sent you away from Chris without warning in the first place.\n\nCarry on with your blocking (welcome to the block club, step-aunt!) and your life.", "NTA. Isn\u2019t it funny how relatives always expect the OP to give money but never do it themselves? Tell your Aunt you will match whatever donation SHE gives and see how quickly she backs off.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry for the way you were treated. And that your \u201cfamily\u201d only contacted you for money. Don\u2019t give them a dime. Live your life.", "NTA.\n\nAnd keep your mouth shut about the money or the roaches will multiply. I'm assuming the mom and aunt just knew ahead of time?", "I\u2019m not sure who is the asshole tbh, because I feel like a parent wouldn\u2019t send their kid to military school just for coming home late. Were there any horrible things you said, were you drinking and driving, were there drugs? I mean if all you did was sneak out, drink, and back in, and it wasn\u2019t every single night, and you weren\u2019t just ignoring all her attempts to contact you and know you were safe, then she WAAAY overreacted. And you have every right to cut her out if it\u2019s too painful for you to have a relationship with her. \n\nBut it seems kind of harsh that your brother is really the innocent victim in all this. \n\nJust from the little bit of info\u2026 It seems like both you and your mom didn\u2019t adequately mourn the loss of your father very well. You because the behavior change and resistance to a secondary parental figure are a pretty telltale sign\u2026 and her, since she needed help with your brother, and companionship, and you were so resistant to let her have that in her life. It all probably made her feel incredibly alone, and terrified she was going to lose you to drugs or prison or something. Those daytime shows are often meant to terrify mothers. They deceptively prey on their anxieties and fears, and a lot of online resources also act like military school is an effective way to get your child back into a good behavioral pattern. It\u2019s possible your stepfather also persuaded her, in which case their relationship is likely very strained because of it. Unless your mother is a psychology or psychiatry major, there is very little likelihood that she believed it would be bad for you.\n\nHer attempts to contact you almost certainly aren\u2019t just for your money, or you would have heard from your family the second it became accessible. She lost you and your dad, and I\u2019m sure your brother\u2019s symptoms increased after you left, and she most likely feels like she\u2019s losing him too. If she wanted your money, she probably would have kept you around, rather than risking a rift in your relationship by sending you to a military school. Or maybe she thought sending you to a military school would help you do better with your money, rather than blowing it on partying. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are an asshole for being angry and needing space regardless\u2026 but I do think you probably need some therapy, and there is a possibility you are being harder on her than you really need to be. If she were willing to do therapy with you, personally, I\u2019d probably go for it in your shoes. \n\nAlso: YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAY FOR YOUR BROTHER\u2019S CARE. That isn\u2019t your burden. Is it nice, meaningful, and caring to do things like that for people you love? Yes, but it\u2019s your money, and he\u2019s not your child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You used to drink and drive. She was probably terrified you were going to get caught by police, or worse, kill yourself or someone else! She couldn't get you under control, so she hoped the school would. You're mad at your mom for a last effort to get you on the right path before she had no authority over you anymore? What a shitty reason to be mad. I understand being resentful of being pushed aside for your younger brother, but don't act like keeping you home was going to make things any different. You still would have cut contact with your mom once you were able to.", "Yes YTA.\n\nYour mum did reach out and write letters while you were away. Did you ever read them? You likely caused your mum and step father a lot more headache than you realized.", "NTA but I think you should reach out, you don't owe you mother anything and this may just be all about her but if they're really struggling, well... he's your brother man, if what she's saying is true then you feel guilty because you know what the right thing to do is, and if you can spare the money, why not?\n\nIt's also worth noting, though it may take you a lot longer to forgive her, but I really find myself believing that your mother was trying to do her best, you know how difficult it can be to handle your brother, I'm not sure you know what it feels like to be the parent of such a child and have to be responsible for everything, it's not like what she did was right but it may make it easier for you to understand if you really try to consider things from her perspective without investing your own emotions into it, I can almost guarantee that she didn't give you much attention because looking after your brother was already too much and she thought you'd be able to take care of yourself by comparison because you don't have the same disability, everytime she asked herself if she needed to focus more on you she probably answered herself with who needed more help with everything, the answer obviously wasn't you even though it sadly left you in the dark a lot of the time, unless she's a straight up narcissist I can't imagine she doesn't love you and doesn't feel genuinely terrible about the way things turned out.\n\nThe other thing I'll say is that I've watched some documentaries about places like the one you got sent to, some of them were genuinely horrific and the unfortunate thing is that most parents had no idea what those places were actually like on the inside when they sent their kids there, usually it was wealthy parents who didn't know how to handle their kids and didn't really care to parent them properly however, not people who were in the same situation as your mother.\n\nLastly I'll say as much as you may be justified in resenting your stepfather, a big part of the reason your mother got together with him was probably because she simply couldn't do it all on her own and she wanted you to have that other parent in your life to put you on the right path, wishful thinking can be a tragic irony at time, but do you really believe that your mother wished ill upon you? My bet is she's probably filled with a lot of regrets about what she did to try to make up for the void your father left in your family's lives when he passed away.\n\nI could be totally wrong, maybe she is actually a narcissist and deserves to suffer, but I can at least guarantee you don't want to die never speaking to your family again.", "I wish i.could afford to award you for this!
