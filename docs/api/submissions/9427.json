I guess 4 classes/12 credit hours is full time - I thought I was just really stupid and couldn\u2019t keep up & then nan died which really threw a wrench in things. I spent almost a 3 weeks trying to have advising team answer me, I had to email all the professors for help. Now I\u2019m having to flat out withdraw from classes & risk my financial aid/gpa/etc, bc class-drop date passed while I was being ignored. I say report her but I\u2019m still upset about everything.

That would still make you the asshole in my view.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is tell her face to face that you think she's slacking off, and start refusing these fake referrals.\n\nIf she continues then you should consider how long there is until she leaves. If it's a few weeks I'd let it slide. If more, then it's time to talk to your supervisors.", "I like this approach.

If the lady really couldn't do her job or struggled due to her pregnancy, management should be stepping in to help- doing a risk assessment, not allowing the overloading of others.\n\nIt sounds like they are unaware the others are being overloaded like this, OP should definitely bring to their attention. If the management are good they'll either help out someone genuinely in need to even the loads again or stop the slacking.\n\nDuring two of my pregnancies, my coworkers would have had to pick up for me as 30% of my job then involved working with things that were unsafe. Poor management would have had me twiddling thumbs while my 4 friends busted their balls, but as good management we had a discussion and changed up the workloads so I took the lions share of desk work while they got to enjoy travel.", "I had absolute nightmare pregnancies.

People who aren't my friends still deserve my respect. And I feel like at least attempting to resolve the issue in-person is part of that respect\n\nStella didn't ask management to make it so that she doesn't have to go up the stairs, she asked Barbara and OP directly. \n\nHow is Stella meant to go complain to management about a polite oral conversation that OP can deny ever happened if it comes to that? \n\nI don't know if it's just a culture thing but I think that if we could just stop assuming that everyone who isn't a friend is an enemy who you should take down or ignore, the world would be a better place for all. \n\nHave I been burned and hurt because some people I've been decent to have taken advantage/deceived me? Yeah, a few times. But it's rarer than you think, and every day I feel a bit better about myself and others by just hoping that people are mostly benevolent.", "going against the grain here- YWBTA.

Some modifications if necessary, sure, but not just outright ignoring your responsibilities. I worked until 38 and a half weeks pregnant and I worked on my feet all day, my coworkers helped me a bit with some stuff here and there (mainly ladders and helping me move awkward/heavy things, but we were close so they never seemed to have a problem helping me out) and I had a stool for times we were a bit slow but other than that I did my job just as before. \n\nI even took some of their work that I knew i wouldn't need any help with to compensate for them helping me out with stuff I couldn't do anymore.

Being pregnant does cause your fingers to stop working. And using the computer for personal reasons are usually against policy for any job. Since this wasn\u2019t a problem before she got pregnant, she\u2019s just going to be talked to, warned and probably monitored. My former job the internet usage was monitored by corporate so if we went on any site that wasn\u2019t for work we would potentially lose our jobs. The likelihood of her losing her job is slim so you should report her. Pregnancy is not an excuse to not work while at work!", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t talk to Stella first. You need to mention to her how she is affecting you and give her a chance to rectify before you tattle your the boss. If she doesn\u2019t shape up, then yes, go to your supervisor!", "Hey just wanna say I'm really sorry you're going through this", "I think this is the best one I've read. Just ask her what's really going on, does she need help somewhere? Maybe it will be something simple yall can just work out and still remain work friends.", "Thank you, no need to be sorry! Unfortunately the end was very long and drawn out for Nan, and I guess I am able to be set to warning status since it\u2019s my first time and then if so, appeal any financial aid take-back. \nTheir advising team was crap but the counselor reached out and I guess they assist in paying for mental health services. Im setting those up soon."]}
