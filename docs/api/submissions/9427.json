I suggest both of you report your co-worker's misuse of company resources together, providing factual times, etc.  Your colleague using her pregnancy as an excuse to not do her job (meaning y'all have to pick up the slack) is calculated behavior, and messed up.  NTA, op.", "NTA", "NTA! I\u2019m almost 30 and trying to go to college for the first time in my life & told my advisor 10000 times I have a full time job and caretaker to my nan, need part time - they said 4 classes would be a breeze. I guess 4 classes/12 credit hours is full time - I thought I was just really stupid and couldn\u2019t keep up & then nan died which really threw a wrench in things. I spent almost a 3 weeks trying to have advising team answer me, I had to email all the professors for help. Now I\u2019m having to flat out withdraw from classes & risk my financial aid/gpa/etc, bc class-drop date passed while I was being ignored. I say report her but I\u2019m still upset about everything. Edit;I had a coworker who came back after maternity-leave and was even more entitled and spoiled than pre-birth. No one\u2019s saying she deserves to be fired but I would still let someone higher up know what\u2019s happening.", "YWBTA.\n\nYou have the right to report her. That would still make you the asshole in my view.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is tell her face to face that you think she's slacking off, and start refusing these fake referrals.\n\nIf she continues then you should consider how long there is until she leaves. If it's a few weeks I'd let it slide. If more, then it's time to talk to your supervisors.", "I like this approach. If there is a computer issue it will get fix.", "Sometimes this can be taken the wrong way though. If Op takes time out of her day to log  (even if it\u2019s just a few mins) a supervisor or HR can easily turn this into \u201cso you have so much extra work and so little time but you still found time to document your co workers short comings?\u201d I\u2019ve had this happen and it was a real slap in the face. The lazy worker was seen as the victim and me the bully who complained but made my situation worse by wasting my own time. \n\nSomething to think about", "Really good advice to document. Then it\u2019s not word against word.\n\nAlso, just to add, in this case it\u2019s irrelevant that she is pregnant.

It is OP\u2019s responsibility to speak up about having to take on unfair extra work, to her manager. \n\nThen it\u2019s up to the manager to deal with the situation.", "The pregnant coworker is aware she's slacking off. She's just hoping to get away with it. Not doing her work has nothing to do with being pregnant. She is bringing the whole department down. Someone shouldn't have to warn a coworker to do their work that they're getting paid for.", "As I said, that's the technically right approach. I still think it's the asshole approach.\n\nToo many people refuse to discuss work issues with co-workers. I firmly believe that you should always try to first sort it out with your co-workers if possible.\n\nIf any indication was given that this Stella wouldn't be receptive to the problem, or might get violent, then it's a different story. If there was a work policy mandating to always go to management first, it'd be different. But nothing of the sort was mentioned", "I agree they don't have to.\n\nIn OP's situation I'd just feel a moral obligation to at leat attempt to solve the issue before involving management. You don't know if management is going to just talk to her or fire her on the spot.\n\nOnce again, no legal obligation, I just try to be a decent person when it costs me as little as a awkward conversation.", "Problem with discussing with co-workers first over going to management is that the co-worker can (and often does) go to management first claiming bullying/discrimination and then you are having to backpedal even if you have a valid point.\n\nCo-workers are not your friends.", "They won't fire a person instantly, let alone a pregnant person. OP should let management handle the situation, especially if a paper trail needs to be started. If the pg coworker is slacking off now, she obviously doesn't care about OP, the work she's piling on, or the work that needs to be done. Pretty bad work ethic and worse human ethic. What will happen when she is more advanced?", "> They won't fire a person instantly, let alone a pregnant person\n\nSpeculation. I've seen it happen.\n\n> she obviously doesn't care about OP, the work she's piling on, or the work that needs to be done. \n\nProbably true, but nothing indicates that her behavior could not be corrected by a single conversation.\n\nOnce again, what does talking to the co-worker cost OP? If Stella doesn't get her shit together or blows her off, OP can report her the next day. If she works properly for a week and slips up, report her at that point.", "Coworker is stealing time. Coworker could contact HR or bosses to report OP harassing her if she tries to deal with the situation on her own. This is not the time to take risks.
