I work full time, he is looking for a job. \n\nRecently, my bf has been complaining a lot to me about my attitude, and has said that it has been impacting him a lot. \n\nI work from home a few days a week, and when I work from home, I tend to be very cold. My work isn\u2019t difficult in itself, but I work in a stressful industry where anything can happen in a matter of a few minutes. I admit it, when I am focus working or studying, I don\u2019t like anything or anyone distracting me, I need to be in a quiet space without any distraction to be able to fully focus. When I go to the office, I just wear earphones when I am focus so that my coworkers know not to bother me. \n\nWhen I WFH, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time with my (unemployed) bf, I will be in our bedroom (where my desk setup is) the entire day and only take a few breaks. My boyfriend usually stays in the living room. When I take a break, I will share a cup of coffee or a short conversation with my boyfriend, but that\u2019s it. \n\nHe recently told me that it feels like he is living with a roommate and that it doesn\u2019t look like I care at all about him. I got concerned because I obviously don\u2019t want him to feel that way and asked him to explain. He said that I am really cold when I work, I don\u2019t show any love towards him, don\u2019t do any PDA and I only cook for myself. He said that all of this is making him feel really sad. He said my attitude is really different when I work/study vs when I am taking rest in the evening. \n\nThroughout the day, when I work, he will also ask me multiple times what time I will get off work. I am supposed to finish at 5pm everyday, but I sometimes finish earlier/later, and I usually am not able to know how long my day will be as it depends on what\u2019s happening on said day, so I usually tell him that I am not sure. He also says that me saying this is \u2018keeping him in the dark\u2019 and \u2018showing that I don\u2019t want to spend time with him\u2019. \n\nI told him that it is just the way I function, I need my own space when I am focus and tend to not show any emotion while working but that doesn\u2019t mean that I am pissed or not in love with him. I told him I would work on this.\n\nThe day after I made sure to consciously be warm and happy during my WFH day. He came to talk to me and I didn\u2019t interrupt him even though I had work to do. After about an hour conversation, I realized that I had completely lost focus and was unproductive the rest of the day. \n\nI told him during the evening that I didn\u2019t want to change the way I work as I am inefficient and he said that I was an AH for knowingly hurting him. He said he didn\u2019t ask for much (he wants me to \u2018appear\u2019 happier). Now, I don\u2019t think I am an AH because I am working and he isn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect me to be at his disposal all the time when I am just trying to focus on my stressful work.", "created_utc": 1680613297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bih3h/aita_for_being_cold_to_my_boyfriend_when_i_am/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you were working at an office would he expect you to message him constantly, cook for him, have coffee with him. No because that would be ridiculous. \n\nHe is bored because he has nothing to do and is therefore expecting you to entertain him at his whim.

He doesn't care about your needs. He only cares that you're not available whenever he wants you to be.\n\nBut you ain't a doll, you're a full-grown adult and he has to learn to deal with it.

He should get a job lol", "Nta - if he's waiting around all day for you to get off work, that's a problem HE needs to solve. There's a middle ground: he can chat with you while you're making food. He can chat with you on your way to the bathroom. He CANNOT enter the bedroom just to chat.", "NTA you are working. If you didn't work from home he would get nothing from you and im sure it would be understood then that it would be unreasonable to expect anything but that because you're at work. You should both just enjoy whatever little breaks you do get with each other when working from home. Also, if you're making food and its something easy to scale up like a pasta or rice dish it couldn't hurt to make him some too if you're feeling sweet. Boyfriend should find something to be content with during the day.", "I think that your BF doesn't think he's asking for much, but that he, in fact, is asking for something that's very expensive for you.  That, by itself, doesn't make either of you AHs.  Your choice to do what you need to do is a responsible one, and your clear communication about it keeps you safely outside of AH territory.  Similarly, your BF is failing to understand the messages you're sending, that his asks are big \\*for you\\*.  This makes him kindof an AH.\n\nNTA.  But you should consider if this relationship is really workable - your BF seems a little more like a needy puppy, and you need an aloof, catlike partner.  I think you might be poorly matched.", "NTA\n\nWorking from home is difficult for people to grasp. It's like they don't really think you can work from home but instead \"pretend\" to work. And that if you do have a work from home position, it's easy and you can do whatever you want. Your BF needs to grow up. You're working at least until 5.

Your jobless bf needs to understand you have a work mode and he'd understand if he had a job...", "Geez, it sounds like You're just doing what normal employee adults do while they work.  He sounds exhausting.  You are WORKING from home, not coddling your boyfriend from home.  Perhaps once he finds a job, he will understand what it's like to need to focus on something besides himself.   \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I get where he\u2019s coming from, if I\u2019m at home and my GF is busy working from home then I get a little lonely. But you know what I and any normal human would do\u2026. Suck it up and entertain your damn self until she\u2019s finished working and then you can have some time with her", "Yeah, this isn't feasible. He needs to treat it as though you're working away in the office. Just because you're at home doesn't mean you're *at home* - you're working. He's clearly not out pounding the pavement looking for jobs, so what exactly is he doing?? The sooner you realize that he's treating you unfairly in many different ways, the better.

It can be hard to shift between work and homelife when you work from home, and you have adapted by essentially being \u201cin office\u201d  in your room. This is entirely appropriate. If you worked in an office he wouldn\u2019t expect you to be available on demand or for a long convo, nor would he expect you to pack or buy him lunch. If he wanted to know when you got off work he would text you, and you\u2019d probably respond the same. \n\nHe is taking your normal and necessary distance as a personal affront.

These boundaries have to be respected or you cannot work \u201ctogether\u201d.
