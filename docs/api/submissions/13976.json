I work full time, he is looking for a job. \n\nRecently, my bf has been complaining a lot to me about my attitude, and has said that it has been impacting him a lot. \n\nI work from home a few days a week, and when I work from home, I tend to be very cold. My work isn\u2019t difficult in itself, but I work in a stressful industry where anything can happen in a matter of a few minutes. I admit it, when I am focus working or studying, I don\u2019t like anything or anyone distracting me, I need to be in a quiet space without any distraction to be able to fully focus. When I go to the office, I just wear earphones when I am focus so that my coworkers know not to bother me. \n\nWhen I WFH, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time with my (unemployed) bf, I will be in our bedroom (where my desk setup is) the entire day and only take a few breaks. My boyfriend usually stays in the living room. When I take a break, I will share a cup of coffee or a short conversation with my boyfriend, but that\u2019s it. \n\nHe recently told me that it feels like he is living with a roommate and that it doesn\u2019t look like I care at all about him. I got concerned because I obviously don\u2019t want him to feel that way and asked him to explain. He said that I am really cold when I work, I don\u2019t show any love towards him, don\u2019t do any PDA and I only cook for myself. He said that all of this is making him feel really sad. He said my attitude is really different when I work/study vs when I am taking rest in the evening. \n\nThroughout the day, when I work, he will also ask me multiple times what time I will get off work. I am supposed to finish at 5pm everyday, but I sometimes finish earlier/later, and I usually am not able to know how long my day will be as it depends on what\u2019s happening on said day, so I usually tell him that I am not sure. He also says that me saying this is \u2018keeping him in the dark\u2019 and \u2018showing that I don\u2019t want to spend time with him\u2019. \n\nI told him that it is just the way I function, I need my own space when I am focus and tend to not show any emotion while working but that doesn\u2019t mean that I am pissed or not in love with him. I told him I would work on this.\n\nThe day after I made sure to consciously be warm and happy during my WFH day. He came to talk to me and I didn\u2019t interrupt him even though I had work to do. After about an hour conversation, I realized that I had completely lost focus and was unproductive the rest of the day. \n\nI told him during the evening that I didn\u2019t want to change the way I work as I am inefficient and he said that I was an AH for knowingly hurting him. He said he didn\u2019t ask for much (he wants me to \u2018appear\u2019 happier). Now, I don\u2019t think I am an AH because I am working and he isn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect me to be at his disposal all the time when I am just trying to focus on my stressful work.", "created_utc": 1680613297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bih3h/aita_for_being_cold_to_my_boyfriend_when_i_am/", "score": 913, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should get a job lol", "Nta - if he's waiting around all day for you to get off work, that's a problem HE needs to solve. There's a middle ground: he can chat with you while you're making food. He can chat with you on your way to the bathroom. He CANNOT enter the bedroom just to chat.", "NTA you are working. If you didn't work from home he would get nothing from you and im sure it would be understood then that it would be unreasonable to expect anything but that because you're at work. You should both just enjoy whatever little breaks you do get with each other when working from home. Also, if you're making food and its something easy to scale up like a pasta or rice dish it couldn't hurt to make him some too if you're feeling sweet. Boyfriend should find something to be content with during the day.", "I think that your BF doesn't think he's asking for much, but that he, in fact, is asking for something that's very expensive for you.  That, by itself, doesn't make either of you AHs.  Your choice to do what you need to do is a responsible one, and your clear communication about it keeps you safely outside of AH territory.  Similarly, your BF is failing to understand the messages you're sending, that his asks are big \\*for you\\*.  This makes him kindof an AH.\n\nNTA.  But you should consider if this relationship is really workable - your BF seems a little more like a needy puppy, and you need an aloof, catlike partner.  I think you might be poorly matched.", "NTA\n\nWorking from home is difficult for people to grasp. It's like they don't really think you can work from home but instead \"pretend\" to work. And that if you do have a work from home position, it's easy and you can do whatever you want. Your BF needs to grow up. You're working at least until 5.

Your jobless bf needs to understand you have a work mode and he'd understand if he had a job...", "Geez, it sounds like You're just doing what normal employee adults do while they work.  He sounds exhausting.  You are WORKING from home, not coddling your boyfriend from home.

I get where he\u2019s coming from, if I\u2019m at home and my GF is busy working from home then I get a little lonely. But you know what I and any normal human would do\u2026. Suck it up and entertain your damn self until she\u2019s finished working and then you can have some time with her", "Yeah, this isn't feasible. He needs to treat it as though you're working away in the office. Just because you're at home doesn't mean you're *at home* - you're working. He's clearly not out pounding the pavement looking for jobs, so what exactly is he doing?? The sooner you realize that he's treating you unfairly in many different ways, the better.

If you worked in an office he wouldn\u2019t expect you to be available on demand or for a long convo, nor would he expect you to pack or buy him lunch.

My infant grandson doesn\u2019t require as much attention as he\u2019s demanding from you.", "NTA.  I worked with my gf (now wife).  Different teams, but similar jobs.  Super high stress, physically dangerous job at times.  There were times our teams would interact, and she and I would be working directly together.  Depending on the situation, either one of us would have to be in charge over the other, and there was absolutely no room for personal anything to be in the way of our professional interactions.  It wasn't coldness, it was professional.\n\nProfessionalism is a requirement for tons of jobs.  Maintaining it means everything, especially to outsiders.  If he can't understand and reflect that, then he might need to learn it to be better employed", "NTA but I wonder if you\u2019d be happier going to the office if possible, or asking him to focus on job hunting the entire time you are working, or moving out.", "NTA\n\nRetired now but worked from home for the last 4 years.  Husband retired early so he was home. \n\nWe agreed if I came out of my office for a snack, lunch or break I would find him to chat. \n\nOther than that unless the house was on fire, a tornado was coming or the Heathens escaped he didn\u2019t come in my office as I was like you in that I was in business mode. Usually a lot of meetings, etc. And I would get crabby when interrupted. \n\nI did have to go back and recheck ages as your bf sounds more like 16 rather than 26. \n\nIMO if he is having this much of an issue with your work style perhaps he needs to spend his days more actively looking for a job vs expecting you to babysit him so he isn\u2019t bored, feeling lonely, being ignored, etc.  \n\nAnd if he keeps feeling sorry for himself due him perceiving you making a living to I presume pay the bills as not loving him then perhaps he needs to move back home for a bit.", "NTA, maybe if he found a job, he wouldn't have so much time to worry about your job.", "NTA, you are working and being professional. Your BF needs to get a job or at least a hobby and not bother you while you\u2019re working!", "God that sounds tiring.\n\nThe whole point of moving in with someone is to get a feel for how you work as a couple when you're living together. You may need to consider whether you've learnt enough.\n\nI'm much the same as you. When I WFH, I'm working. My whole family knows this.", "This. OP, when my husband was laid off, he literally got up at the same time every day as when he was working and left at the same time (his home office). He said his new job was getting a job. He had an Excel sheet, where he kept track of where he had applied, and at what point he was at with each company. He even had the date where he should thank people for an interview, or follow up on an application.\n\nIf your BF is busy finding a job, he won't have time to harass you about not focusing on him. If he's just relaxing and enjoying life, every minute without you might leave him bored and feeling clingy.\n\nAre you sure this is the guy for you?", "Emotional labour on tap, as well as a roof over his head and food provided. What a catch.", "This sounds like my 2 pups when I work from home. \n\nHowever, they are good boys and stay in their beds by my feet. They rarely bark and are happy with a bit of kibble and a few pets. \n\nMaybe op should ditch the guy and get a dog?", "Why does HE HAVE A JOB?!?!  NTA. You are at work and need to focus. You don\u2019t need to be babysitting his feelings while you are at work. Maybe if he had a job, he wouldn\u2019t be there to notice you weren\u2019t all warm and fuzzy to him.", "I've been grinding to update my resume and LinkedIn and can confirm that it requires a lot of time to research resume expectations and trends, edit, get feedback, and make further revisions.", "NTA. Your unemployed bf needs to grow the fuck up lol. I don't think your relationship with him is gonna work.", "NTA and the least he could do is make you both lunch while he sits around crying about your work ethic", "NTA.  This is one of the HUGE downsides to working from home no one talks about and why it's not all it's cracked up to be.  YOU are working.  You're not at everyone's beck and call, you can't take breaks all the time or have 30-minute conversations in person or on the phone because \"you're  home\".  You can't  just do this one errand or these two chores as \"you're  home all day\".  I've had to tell people that I don't take personal calls or even answer the door during working hours unless it's an emergency - ONCE in about 23 years of working from home.  After all this time, it still happens, requests are made, etc., and IT'S MADDENING!  \n    You should certainly set your boundaries and explain it one more time that work mode is work mode for you.  He should spend his time resume writing, job searching, interviewing, growing up, and/or getting some therapy to deal with his issues.", "He needs to get a job to help with his mental health", "I'd say NTA.\n\nOne option would be to try and make clearer delimitation when you're working from home.  Have an alarm set for 5 when you should be getting off and do your best to stick to it.  That will be better for your own mental health as well I think.\n\nBut yeah, if you're working from home, he shouldn't have expectations of you being free to do whatever you want.  Despite what a lot of people think, that's not how that's supposed to work.", "NTA- tell your loser boyfriend to get off his lazy ass and find a job.", "Leave the bum.  What the fuck are you wasting your time on", "NTA - When you are working he shouldn't expect to be bothering you just as if you were working outside the home. If anything he should be cooking you meals and doing all the housework since he's unemployed to show appreciation to you.", "You don\u2019t owe him any explanation whatsoever for anything you do, or don\u2019t do, while you are AT WORK. What is wrong with him? Does he not understand what jobs are? He sounds very controlling and manipulative overall, putting you on the defensive about how you do your job which is none of his business, and apparently also supports him. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t he get off his dead ass and look for a job?", "NTA there\u2019s a pretty good chance he\u2019s trying to sabotage your job because he\u2019s jealous you\u2019re the primary earner in the relationship. He\u2019s incredibly immature and instead of spending his time whining about you being \u201cmean\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d he should be out looking for a job, WFH isn\u2019t a \u201clet\u2019s hang out\u201d time, you legitimately have work to do and need to be able to focus. You might want to reevaluate this relationship, it appeared to work when you lived separately but now that you live together you can now see where there\u2019s a mismatch between your work goals and his life goals. Good luck.", "NTA - My hubby works from home and when he's at work, he AT work we don't bother him with stuff till his work day is over. We often get short answers in reply. Explain that you are paid to do your job when WFH not babysit his childish behind", "All this. It amazes me that there are STILL people out there (even after Covid WFH and everything) that don't realize it is WORK from home. Would boyfriend expect OP to come home at lunch and make it for them? Would boyfriend expect hourly phone calls from OP when they are at the office? No (or, at least, I hope not). So he shouldn't expect that when OP is working from home.\n\nThe fact, though, that boyfriend called out the difference in OP's attitude during the work day versus when they are relaxing in the evenings means boyfriend is either deliberately obtuse and manipulative or completely clueless. Neither is good. That statement alone should tell OP to dump boyfriend.\n\nOne final thing: OP you are not \"cold\" to your boyfriend - YOU ARE WORKING!!!", ">And he wants her to \"'appear' happier\".\n\nSo basicly a synonym of \"You need to smile more\"\n\nJust... Ugh!", "Don\u2019t forget he expects her to cook him lunch while she\u2019s on her lunch break as well. \u201cI don\u2019t show any love towards him, don\u2019t do any PDA and I only cook for myself\u201d like is she supposed to cook him lunch even though he\u2019s the one sitting around all day?", "Yea and pouting, she only cooked gor herself.", "This is what my mom always told me! Looking for a job is a full time job", "How do I do all this?", "I'm by no means an expert but this is what I did. \n\n1. Start by searching resumes and job listings in your field on Google. Look for examples in your specific field. \n2. Open up your resume if you have one already. Make sure it's up to date (the latest or current position is included).\n   1. If not, start listing your former jobs, skills, education, and experiences. Figure out the timing for each of these. \n   2. What skills did you learn during these experiences (look into soft skills)? There are some soft skills that are universally applicable. What are the job listings looking for? \n3. If you went to university, your school probably has a resume feedback service. My brother and his wife are helping me out a lot. The biggest thing I have learned is that most people keep a long resume that they pull from to make a resume that specifically addresses the job they are applying for.", "Are you his mother?!", "He's not working. Why isn't he the one doing most of the chores? What exactly does he do all day besides whine that you're not giving him enough attention?", "I think you should really reconsider being in this relationship.  Can you deal with your boyfriend\u2019s neediness and his lack of drive for 5, 10, 20 years?   He doesn\u2019t do chores, doesn\u2019t cook, and makes you responsible for making him happy during the day when you work from home.    He sounds very immature.   \n\nIf you decide to continue with this relationship, pick up the book Fair Play by Eve Rodsky.  It helps couples identify tasks and chores and split the workload in a fair way.\n\nNTA."]}
