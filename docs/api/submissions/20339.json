We stored it over to my mom's house. \n\nWe are currently living with my sister while putting in home applications and house searching. It's been a bit stressful because my wife is not a dog person at all and there are 4 pretty untrained dogs here (Aussie Shepherds) who shed like there's no tomorrow. My sister and her husband aren't exactly on top of cleanliness either so there's piles of dog hair in the corners of the home that you could probably make a full rug out of. \n\nWell, my mom said I need to move the recliner somewhere because she needs to store some of her own items and doesn't have room. I told her I'd come grab it tomorrow. I came home and told my wife about it and my sister suggested I bring the recliner there and just stick it in the living room. My wife said no, she was going to find storage for it. My sister didn't push the issue, but we don't have anywhere else to store it either. I told my wife later (when we were alone) that we didn't have anywhere else to store it and she said she would have to figure it out because her recliner is definitely not coming here. When I asked why, she said \"I'm not having my one piece of furniture destroyed by a bunch of disgusting dogs. I want the recliner and if I bring it here, it's staying here. I'm not willing to do that.\" I told her at this point she's being difficult because I need to move that chair and don't really have time for her to figure it out.

Your mom has a right to the use of her living space, but is there some leeway time-wise she can grant you to move that thing? You could've discussed moving it to your sister's place and getting a slip cover for it to encourage her to meet you halfway.

She truly only has the recliner. That's like, her one big item. She hardly has any clothing. The only other thing she has is her computer. \n\nI, on the other hand, have a lot of stuff. So maybe she felt forced in to being a minimalist? I had never thought of it like that but I guess it would make sense.

He prioritized his things, took advantage of the fact she is a minimalist and exercised entitlement to take more space than his fair share and then denied protecting one of the few things she cherished.

For me this all hinges on the cost of the storage unit, who's paying and who's stuff is inside. Let's say they pay equally for arguments sake, but 80% if the stuff inside is his, he is TA for taking more than his fair share and her having to put her recliner at risk especially considering she has so little items.

There is no reason they need to be staying with 4 untrained dogs and shuffling belongings around like silly college students if they were able to pay rent and save for a house while they were living in the previous apartment.

Your better off without her as a friend if she\u2019d stop talking to you over a fact she could have verified herself. We have an Australian Cattle Dog, and a Berger Blanc Swiss, which translates to a White Swiss Shepherd. They are also part of a convoluted name story. The German Shepherd was developed to preserve the vanishing Thuringian shepherd, a local working dog that was fading from the advent of farm industrialization. The Thuringian was often white, as the color was accepted better by sheep. However, when the Nazis came to power, they kicked the father of the breed, Max von Stephanitz, out of his own breed club, and banned the white color as \u201cweak and inferior.\u201d Plus they wanted to use them as war dogs, and the white showed up at night. They had all white puppies killed. Even after the Nazis fell, the club kept the standard, and pups in Europe were still often killed. Since the white color is recessive, it took a while before the gene was stamped out in Europe. There was a reservoir of the white color in North America, where people kept them as beautiful, but the AKC will not let them show in conformation as the color is still banned. Mind you, they are not albino, and have black skin markings, black eyeliner, and black nose. They are not deaf, as the deafness gene is linked to Merle and piebald. Decades ago, a Swiss woman got fed up with this Nazi vestige barring these beautiful dogs from getting recognized, so she imported dogs from North America, and created her own breed to a different standard than the GSD. Luckily, this predated the GSD being bred to look like hyenas and stagger around. A BBS looks like a white wolf. \n\nSo here\u2019s where the name gets really complicated. The White Swiss Shepherd had to import dogs from North America (US and Canada) to recreate what the original German progenitor dog looked like, and save this valid color, and try to atone for the wrongs done by the Nazis to these dogs. Her breed got recognized by the FCI, but the German Shepherd Dog breed club blocked its recognition in the AKC. It claims it\u2019s just a GSD. But, if a BBS has the conformation of a GSD, it\u2019s instant disqualification. That sloping back is a disqualifying fault. American dogs that are related to the seed stock used by the Swiss woman to develop the breed aren\u2019t recognized by FCI, because they weren\u2019t bred by FCI pedigreed dogs.\n\nThere\u2019s this schism where American breeders who diverted from the GSD breed standard, and bred anatomically correct white dogs, want to be included. Some BBS breeders want to keep their breed book closed, especially when American breeders had to travel to Slovenia, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, or Sweden, and import FCI dogs (developed in the first place from American dogs, which descended from German dogs).\n\nIt\u2019s an entomology labyrinth.", "I have a mini Australian shepherd (he\u2019s 4 now) and I spent last year in Australia.
