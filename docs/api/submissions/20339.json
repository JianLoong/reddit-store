Given that my wife is a minimalist, we were able to rent out the smallest storage locker and fit everything inside, with the exception of one item: her recliner. We stored it over to my mom's house. \n\nWe are currently living with my sister while putting in home applications and house searching. It's been a bit stressful because my wife is not a dog person at all and there are 4 pretty untrained dogs here (Aussie Shepherds) who shed like there's no tomorrow. My sister and her husband aren't exactly on top of cleanliness either so there's piles of dog hair in the corners of the home that you could probably make a full rug out of. \n\nWell, my mom said I need to move the recliner somewhere because she needs to store some of her own items and doesn't have room. I told her I'd come grab it tomorrow. I came home and told my wife about it and my sister suggested I bring the recliner there and just stick it in the living room. My wife said no, she was going to find storage for it. My sister didn't push the issue, but we don't have anywhere else to store it either. I told my wife later (when we were alone) that we didn't have anywhere else to store it and she said she would have to figure it out because her recliner is definitely not coming here. When I asked why, she said \"I'm not having my one piece of furniture destroyed by a bunch of disgusting dogs. I want the recliner and if I bring it here, it's staying here. I'm not willing to do that.\" I told her at this point she's being difficult because I need to move that chair and don't really have time for her to figure it out.
