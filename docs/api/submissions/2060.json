No clue if $2500/month is reasonable rent where you live.  Regardless, if he's not happy with the arrangement he can move out.", "NTA. \n\nThat's a better deal than most flats nowadays to be honest, with that much room and that big of a family. I'd take that up in a heartbeat.", "INFO: how much do all those things (gas, electric, phones, etc) cost you altogether? How much are comparable rent prices in your area?\n\nIf you're not profiting from him, it might be worth showing him how much all these things cost and explaining where that figure comes from. Or transferring some of the bills to him and deducting that money from what you charge him per month.", "NTA - 2500 a month for a 5BR house and practically the only living expense he has is food and vehicle? Where do I sign up? AND you moved out of your own house so he could live in it? Your son is being extremely ungrateful.", "INFO -- have you sat down with him and shown him a breakdown of the specific numbers on all these expenses?", "NTA. Tell son to do some shopping and if he can find a better deal, you will let him out of the arrangement he has with you. Watch how fast he back pedals. \n\nAnd why can't he buy clothes for his three kids? And why isn't he paying for his cellphones.", "Honestly, sit down with him and show him the itemized bills for the house that YOU are paying for with that 2500 AND show him how little that actually covers.  He is 29, alot of these bills, if he's actually buying the house should be paid by him every month with his own accounts.  I don't understand why you are doing all the work for him?  Does he have any other bills that he is responsible for that he takes care of on his own?   It sounds like he hasn't a clue the true cost of owning a home entails.  Is the house sell a private matter and no banks involved?  \n\nMore Info.", "NTA\n\nYou include utilities in that?  Gees..... that would be a decent price for rent alone!", "NTA, tell him he can move whenever he feels like :)", "That depends on where you live.", "NTA. Honestly you are undercharging him with all those people there- no way $2500 covers all the costs (or does it? And if it does where is this?) Why not ask him to find alternative housing so you can charge a stranger the market rate. Maybe once he looks around a while he will realize you\u2019re actually subsidizing his family.", "If he doesn't like it, he can move! NTA", "INFO: why are you charging rent if you've sold the place to him? Shouldn't the mortgage payment be in his name if he bought it? Why is there a clothing allowance for his kids in the ?rent charges?  \n\nI don't think you're an AH, but I think you've bundled in too many things with these monthly fees you're charging him, and I think that makes it easy for him to assume you're doing something fishy.  \n\nLet him manage his own finances and charge him rent/actually sell him the house.", "My issue is that your son was 20 when he had a child with a 17yo. Means she got pregnant at 16. Is it just me that finds it wierd? \nNTA for the rent though.", "NAH - but you've muddied the waters by lumping so much together.  No wonder no one is happy.\n\nMake his payment just for principle/interest and let him arrange for everything else separately.  This will teach him and his family, also, to be careful with the utilities.  Otherwise, they may be setting thermostats at inefficient levels or wasting water.  If he decides to move out - better to know how to manage these utilities NOW than later.", "INFO: how much does the house cost? Is he renting it from you, or does this $2500 go towards purchasing it?", "Info: If the agreement was to buy, why hasn\u2019t he taken over the mortgage and related bills?", "Tell him he has 30 days to find a new place to live, and then another 30 days to move out, so he can find a place that won't make such a profit on him", "NTA - when people rent out their property they are looking to cover expenses and make a profit, that is the deal! If your son has an issue, tell him to find a different place and find someone else to rent your house. You should be making a profit!", "Nah. Sit down with your son and show him the household bills and where his money is going every month. You need to be paying on your own phone bills and loans that you took out. That's where I take issue with your charges.\n\nShow him the mortgage, insurance, property taxes,and reoccurring bills for the home. If he is buying the property for 2500 a month there should also be an end date to these payments. He should know how much he's being charged and what the expected payoff date is for the house mortgage. Most likely he's complaining because he doesn't realize how much the bills actually cost for where he's living.", "Info can't really tell if you're overcharging without more info.\n\nWhat's rent for a similar house in the area\nHow much are utilities?\nWhy are you paying paying for phones and his kids clothes?  \nHow much is cable/internet?\n\nThe new roof is irrelevant.   As the landlord it is your responsibility to maintain the house. Same with house insurance.   It's your house, ofc you're paying for your own insurance. \n\nIt seems like a spreadsheet with what the bills are would solve this pretty quickly.", "ESH. Sounds like you are doing some weird owner-financing that your son doesn\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand it either.  I\u2019m unclear why children\u2019s clothing, 2cell phones and utilities are included. I\u2019d suggest your son either get a mortgage through a bank or move to place he has more control over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To me, it doesn't necessarily speak to OP (fairly or unfairly) profiting off the deal, but it seems like over controlling their finances. Maybe some people would prefer paying one person one fee for all their monthly bills, but it seems their son doesn't. I wouldn't like it.  \n\nIt also \"muddies the water\" regarding what's a fair/reasonable rate to pay.
