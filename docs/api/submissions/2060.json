If he really doesn't like the deal you're giving him as a landlord, then he can go and find another place to live. Your son needs to come back to you with a sincere apology, or he and his family should be packing their bags. I get that you want to provide for your family and it's hard to find trustworthy renters, but it is absolutely not worth renting to your son if he thinks he can talk to you like that, and it puts him in the place of not being a trustworthy renter. You'd be better going through a rental agency so they can find a match to fill the place.\n\nYour son needs to come back to you with a sincere apology now, or you need to start giving him his marching orders so he can go fend for his family, and trying to squeeze an even better deal out of you. Cuz really that's what this reads as, he's trying to speak to you with disrespect to negotiate a lower cost. Don't play the game", "Have you sat down and discussed what the money actually goes toward?  Does he think you're just pocketing this money rather than paying actual bills with it?  Has he not marveled at how he pays you but has no bills of his own to contend with?\n\nI'd say if he can't reverse his cranio-rectal inversion, tell him find his own place and get better tenants.", "I pay 3,000 in just rent for a 4 bed 2 bath house.   NTA but you did raise one!", "NTA. Read the top comments.", "Why are YOU renting an apartment while collecting $2500 from him as rent? $2500 a month could be used on a mortgage.", "Nta in any scenario about this. He agreed, plus I pay that in California for an apartment. He needs to grow up", "NTA If your son can find a better deal elsewhere tell him he is free to take it. He isn't a tree he can move. Tell your son he is free to move into a place that is a better fit for him.", "NTA.  Tell him to feel free to move out.  Please stop paying the cell phone, cable, internet clothes for his family. Get the utilities in his name and have a rental agreement drawn up by a lawyer for him to sign, If he doesn't like it he can move.", "$2,500???? That is sooooo low for a house. Your son is acting like a child and trying to take advantage of you. \n\nNTA at all!", "NTA and stop subsidizing your family\u2019s living expenses. You are not doing any favours, adults need to be self sufficient, it is the most important lesson of adulthood. Let him rent whatever home he can afford and pay his bills the best that he can.", "NTA - what he really means is that its time for him to inherit early.  He considers your property his , just with a timing issue.\n\nIts clear he doesn't have the best justment - he became a father at 20 and his wife was still in high school !!  You probably helped him at the time, to get established, start a family and instead of them working etc. he took on board other dependants !!\n\nIts time for this 29yo to grow up and cut the chord", "YTA. TO YOURSELF. \nTime for son to learn the realities of living without your assistance. Send them packing and sell up / rent to new tenants formally.", "Charge him rent only and make it enough to cover the insurance, trash and roof. Stop the utilities and kids clothes and make him buy that himself. So maybe you decrease his rent by $300-$500 but he\u2019s now paying his own utilities, cable, cell phone and kids clothes. See if he still thinks $2500 was a bad deal", "NTA. That's extremely cheap for a house that size.", "Where I live $2500 would get you that house but not with utilities and definitely not with cell phones and clothing allowance!", "NTA Seems like the easiest solution is to evict your son. Sell or rent to independent tenants.", "NTA. That\u2019s what the mortgage payments cost on my 5 bedroom, 4 bath house.", "NTA.\n\nYour username is amazing!\n\nYour son obviously has no real world experience with rent, so I suggest you give him notice to vacate and let him experience it all first hand.", "The minimum you should charge is the cost of mortgage, taxes, insurance, any utilities you pay, and about 10% to bank for repairs. If mortgage paid off, then cost if you had a mortgage. Zillow often has a rent estimator on houses.", "NTA, he is your son you don't want to ruin your relationship with him over a misunderstanding. Give him a break down of what you pay. Once he sees it on paper hopefully he sees you are not profiting off him. If he still argues then let him know if he can find a place cheaper he is free to move no hard feelings.", "NTA and has he seen the financial breakdown of what you pay for the house to be functioning as he \u201cbuys\u201d it? I put that in quotations because it doesn\u2019t seem he grasps what is going on. If any landlord I ever had paid for utilities + amenities + mobiles + clothes I would have worshipped at their feet.", "NTA.  Evict him, rent the house out or sell it.", "Sell him the house if he thinks he get all that shit cheaper. NTA", "You ain\u2019t charging enough!", "NTA \n\nContact an attorney to confirm how much time you need to give your son to move out.\n\nGive your son a notice to move out by (x) days as required by law. Tell him he can move out or buy the house at the price you are quoting.\n\nHe says he\u2019s tired of you profiting off him? Well, he can find out how much houses cost to rent or buy in the real world", "I don\u2019t understand how people are voting. Where I live you would be making a profit. If the house is in California, you would be losing money. It all depends on cost of housing in your area and the condition of your specific property. Need more info.", "Rethink things and stop babying him. He needs to wake up and pay more expenses.", "I only say YTA for allowing him to stay and take advantage of you.", " NTA - sell the house at market rate", "Just for the rent in the utilities that's a two bedroom around here. That doesn't include phone bills, the groceries being taken care of, the kids being given clothes, and all that labor time. Like no matter where you are, all of the time and effort the poster is putting in makes the total cost at far more than what he is paying", "Absolutely! Their son should move out as soon as he can. It's How hard is it to find a 5 bedroom house with multiple full bathrooms that includes utilities for 7 people. $2500 a month is an insane amount to pay.", "This right here. Like you've truly been making yourself a servant at his disposal, you need to redraw the lines because your son does not respect you which is why he's trying to squeeze even more out of you for less.\n\nYou need to draw boundaries right now", "In most markets $2,500 a month for a house this size, with utilities included and the option to purchase, is a real deal. Everything else you include is truly above and beyond. You obviously love your son and his family. You moved out of your own home and rented an apartment for crying out loud! He should be truly appreciative for such an opportunity. The fact that he isn't is an indicator that it's time for a real discussion about reality vs entitlement. \n\nAnd forgive my curiosity, what does his MiL contribute to the household?", "Where I live that house that size would easily go for $1.5 to 2 million easily\n\nI pay 3,000 for a 4 bed 2 bath house and that is just rent alone!", "It'd be a deal at twice that price.", "Seriously. OP, you could probably find another renter right from this thread if you wanted", "California here.  My area is $2400/month no utilities included for a 2bed 2full bath apartment. Semi-rural area.", "Size? Yeah. Population? No.", "I mean not so unbelievable, his parent is already giving him so much, the poster set themself up in this dynamic as a subservient, so he's trying to treat them like a subservient. \n\nIf you give too much people start to expect it, and then they want even more. It's not unbelievable given the dynamic already set up.", "And? People still live in the whole state not just Chicago."]}
