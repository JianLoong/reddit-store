No clue if $2500/month is reasonable rent where you live.

I'd take that up in a heartbeat.", "INFO: how much do all those things (gas, electric, phones, etc) cost you altogether? How much are comparable rent prices in your area?\n\nIf you're not profiting from him, it might be worth showing him how much all these things cost and explaining where that figure comes from. Or transferring some of the bills to him and deducting that money from what you charge him per month.", "NTA - 2500 a month for a 5BR house and practically the only living expense he has is food and vehicle? Where do I sign up? AND you moved out of your own house so he could live in it? Your son is being extremely ungrateful.", "INFO -- have you sat down with him and shown him a breakdown of the specific numbers on all these expenses?", "NTA. Tell son to do some shopping and if he can find a better deal, you will let him out of the arrangement he has with you.

He is 29, alot of these bills, if he's actually buying the house should be paid by him every month with his own accounts.  I don't understand why you are doing all the work for him?  Does he have any other bills that he is responsible for that he takes care of on his own?   It sounds like he hasn't a clue the true cost of owning a home entails.  Is the house sell a private matter and no banks involved?  \n\nMore Info.", "NTA\n\nYou include utilities in that?  Gees..... that would be a decent price for rent alone!", "NTA, tell him he can move whenever he feels like :)", "That depends on where you live.", "NTA. Honestly you are undercharging him with all those people there- no way $2500 covers all the costs (or does it? And if it does where is this?) Why not ask him to find alternative housing so you can charge a stranger the market rate.

Why is there a clothing allowance for his kids in the ?rent charges?  \n\nI don't think you're an AH, but I think you've bundled in too many things with these monthly fees you're charging him, and I think that makes it easy for him to assume you're doing something fishy.  \n\nLet him manage his own finances and charge him rent/actually sell him the house.", "My issue is that your son was 20 when he had a child with a 17yo. Means she got pregnant at 16. Is it just me that finds it wierd? \nNTA for the rent though.", "NAH - but you've muddied the waters by lumping so much together.  No wonder no one is happy.\n\nMake his payment just for principle/interest and let him arrange for everything else separately.  This will teach him and his family, also, to be careful with the utilities.  Otherwise, they may be setting thermostats at inefficient levels or wasting water.  If he decides to move out - better to know how to manage these utilities NOW than later.", "INFO: how much does the house cost?

If your son has an issue, tell him to find a different place and find someone else to rent your house. You should be making a profit!", "Nah. Sit down with your son and show him the household bills and where his money is going every month. You need to be paying on your own phone bills and loans that you took out. That's where I take issue with your charges.\n\nShow him the mortgage, insurance, property taxes,and reoccurring bills for the home. If he is buying the property for 2500 a month there should also be an end date to these payments. He should know how much he's being charged and what the expected payoff date is for the house mortgage.

As the landlord it is your responsibility to maintain the house. Same with house insurance.   It's your house, ofc you're paying for your own insurance. \n\nIt seems like a spreadsheet with what the bills are would solve this pretty quickly.", "ESH.
