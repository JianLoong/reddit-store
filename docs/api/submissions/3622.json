Unless you were disrupting the service she had no right to tell you to leave. It isn't very christian of her to be complaining. As long as you weren't interrupting the service by checking your phone or making a huge deal out of kissing him it should be fine. Sister is kind of TA for worrying your BF tho.", "NTA. \n\nAs a Christian, it\u2019s pretty fucking infuriating that somebody thought it appropriate to treat you that way. As to your behavior in church, it was entirely appropriate. You were respectful of the service. You didn\u2019t make loud noises. It\u2019s not against the rules of church to check your phone real quick in an emergency. \n\nFurther, the fact that you are even there as an Atheist shows me that you care deeply about your family. You\u2019re willing to sit through a sermon for something you do not believe in. \n\nThe church is supposed to be a place where all people can congregate. Jesus Christ dined with criminals and prostitutes, you\u2019re a very respectful gay atheist, that\u2019s not a crime, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA and I am sorry your family didn\u2019t protect you from that hatred. You deserve better especially since you are only there to support them", "NTA, you need to treat yourself with respect.", "The prophet Samuel kissed Saul, king of Israel as a sign of respect. \n\nPaul encouraged Christian brethren in the New Testament to \"greet one another with a holy kiss\". \n\nJesus let Judas kiss him on the lips. \n\nThere\u2019s kissing throughout the Bible. Men and men, men and women and people with fake god statues. \n\nThat woman should read the Bible. Your mom should support you.", "NTA. The woman created the disruption not you.", "NTA\n\nThere is no hate like Christian \"love\".", "NTA. You were a lot more polite than I would have been. That woman is clearly a homophobic bigot.", "Definitely NTA sorry that happened! That church sucks.", "File a formal complaint?! With whom?! It\u2019s not your workplace! NTA", "Lol at the idea of banning someone from a church. So Christian like. \n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA\n\nFirst off, like most religious people, this woman is a judgmental homophobe, which, IMO by default makes her a hateful and bad person.  \n\nRegarding this situation, it would have been one thing if the priest/pastor/whatever who runs the church were to ask you to leave, but this woman isn't in charge and she isn't the church police, she doesn't have any right or authority to kick you out.  And you're right, she is the one that caused the disturbance.  \n\nThis is why religious people are the worst... they claim to be all about love and caring and forgiveness when in reality most of them are judgmental bigots and hypocrites who hate anyone who doesn't follow their stupid BS dogma and try to force their values on other people.", "ESH.  Yes, obviously, homophobia bad.  But while I\u2019m not trying to suggest that having your phone out and checking texts in the middle of a service is anywhere near the same level of offense, it *is* still disrespectful and distracting.  If you were so concerned that you couldn\u2019t at least wait long enough to excuse yourself and go out into the hall, you probably should have just stayed home.", "The person whose opinion you need to care about is your own mother, not some random woman. This was her church community, and if she's religious then it matters to her. What does she think of your behaviour?\n\nAs an aside, your boyfriend's sister is kind of an asshole.  Considering that you were away from home, there was no point to her getting anyone upset about the dog in advance of the diagnosis: she was already on the way to the vet, and could have just texted with all the information at once.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.

A fog threw up and acted strange seems pretty normal dog behavior. But regardless, if it felt like a big emergency and you'd be on your phones and sharing information one of you should have sat outside or in the last row.
