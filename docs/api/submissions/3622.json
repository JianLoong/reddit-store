I'm a butch lesbian and lost a lot of friends and family over it (who were all Christian). Now that I'm on college, it's become easier to stop affiliating Christianity with hate. I live in the deep south, and most of the Christians I meet now are super loving and accepting, or even queer themselves. I think it's just that every Christian is different.

A church is a place. It can be nostalgic. It can be a place where you see and interact with family in a unique way. You don\u2019t need to accept the doctrine to enter a church. I\u2019ve gone into churches for weddings and family events. I didn\u2019t burst into flames and I wasn\u2019t filled with the holy spirit. It\u2019s just a building.

I don\u2019t believe god cares about who you sleep with or the angle of your dangle, but your character.

None of this bigotry crap, anti vac, or thumping.", "I usually just call Saul a false apostle and ask if they eat lobster or wear clothes of two clothes.  That takes out a Leviticus and anything Peter wrote and then it becomes a much more tolerant book.  If you take the book literally god created the world 2-3 times."]}
