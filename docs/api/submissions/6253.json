On her late dads side is because also not a redneck conservative but how dare I marry her dad and move him away from his home. She very much knows she is not the favorite or even liked and it breaks my heart. Her 26 year old cousin asked her a few months ago if she like them as a kid. My daughter replied that as an only child she thought they where as close as siblings. Niece said no we hated you and then laughed like it was no big deal. She was then told all of my siblings and mom would get together and talk about what a bad mother I was and what a brat she was because she got to travel and have things. Those things came at the expense of her dad working on ships and being gone 80%of her life until he died when she was 15. The traveling we did was when he was docked long enough we could go see him or when he had schooling. Her nice things now are because of her inheritance when he died and she used most of it to start her nonprofit. Well needless to say after I confronted my family they are really made now because I stopped all college assistance and took them off my trust so who is laughing now.", "NTA.

Being with the adults and the under 2s is easy. They are easy to entertain, they are happy to be bounced while adults chat, they can be given toys and play.\n\n9 year old would want to have adult attention more often, my nephew's at that age constantly want auntie to play with them, they do not stop talking ever, they are energetic, they would want to go to activities or cafes that suit a kid. Not be ok with adults at a cafe relaxing. \n\nWhen the young kids are around we can talk and play things like cards against humanity, or even just any board game. When the 9yo is there they won't be in bed as early so less hang out talk freely time, less likely to play adult games, even board games, then 9yo wants to play and let's be honest....most of the time that makes it less fun for the adults. \n\nI love my nieces and nephews. I love playing with them, talking and hanging out.... I would absolutely take the 2yr old out with us for girls hang out. But if she said she was bringing the 2yo, 4yo and 7yo.... Yeah nah. That's auntie plays with the kids time. But girls weekend to relax. And the other family member who have kids of that age probably want a break for kids, instead of having to be nice and patient with the 9yo\n\n\nExcept - the Christmas thing is much weirder and that part they are TA if excluded those kids. Sounds like they didn't get presents for your kids, only for your shared kids with partner.", "NTA- as someone with a child (K) from a previous relationship and who also shares a child (L) with my husband of 20+ years, K has always been treated differently/ less favorably than L, who is biologically related to my in-laws. Initially I would point out the obvious differences in the treatment in a genuine effort to help them see/ change their ways, but after two decades of this, I just am LC with them.
