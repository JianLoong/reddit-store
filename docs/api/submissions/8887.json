SO SO SO NTA", "NTA  \nWhat in the actual fuck, fuck those employees. The comments those gym employees make are the one of the reasons why people don't go to the gym, those comments just feed into people's insecurities. 100% report them because those are not the people you want at your gym.", "NTA \u2013 People working in fitness should be there to build people up, not tear them down.", "NTA, the gym instructors were being assholes for rating people coming in, doubly so for doing within earshot. I hope you can find a new gym that has decent human beings in it. You deserve it. I hope the instructors have their T.V. remote chewed by a dog.", "NTA. They deserve it and should be severely sanctioned if not fired. If they're making you uncomfortable they're definitely making other members uncomfortable too. It's important to let the gym know why they lost a long term member. \n\nAlso, please understand that these people are assholes and there is nothing wrong with you or your body. Be kind to yourself, and be proud of standing up for yourself.", "NTA. That was completely inappropriate & would likely bother most people.", "NTA. You come to the gym to exercise, and your goal is to lose some weight and be happy. No one should be judged for that, and no one should be commenting on it. I hope their manager handles it swiftly and firmly.", "NTA and those people are terrible. They shouldn't make assumptions and it's not their place to judge. Everybody has their own pace they work with and everybody does the best that they can- and if they're at least going to the gym, they're making progress! they're really trying. Fuck those pigs!\n\n Edited to add you should follow up with management and make sure that they have been dealt with and let them know that you have ceased your membership. Perhaps they will reinstate a membership for you if you can get them to ensure that you will have a safe and non hostile space to work out in. \n\nOtherwise, I would straight up complain on social media if you've got a facebook, they shouldn't be making judgmental comments, they possibly could be discriminating against people as well since they're so concerned about judging people based upon appearance. It's just a slippery slope with that type of shallow agenda going on.", "NTA , those staff members are assholes.", "NTA. They should absolutely lose their jobs over this.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, I know this sucks but they're just awful people and don't deserve the ability to affect your happiness.", "NTA\n\nTell the manager. \n\nThat kind of behaviour creates an incredibly toxic environment.", "NTA but this is far too common an experience in gyms and why I won\u2019t ever go back to them. How on Earth are people supposed to get healthy if you\u2019re gonna judge them and make them feel unwelcome. Ugh, posts like this make me hate humanity all over again. \n\nSorry you experienced this OP, you\u2019re smashing it and should be feeling so proud of yourself. Ignore what those dickwads were saying, hopefully their boss rips them a new one. But don\u2019t be put off your journey. Keep being awesome.", "NTA it's unprofessional and will cost the gym money and reputation.", "NTA !!!!

That is totally inappropriate especially knowing people at a gym is probably insecure about their size to begin with.", "NTA.  They were being rude.  They have no business being instructors if that's how they view and treat customers.", "NTA, they're essentially gym employees standing at the gym entrance and insulting paying customers(assuming a paid membership)\n\nBut if a gym helps you then go try and find a new one or get some home equipment. I know it will likely remind you of this for a while but it sounds like going to a gym has done a lot more good for you than bad.", "NTA. That\u2019s ridiculously bad for business. I\u2019d cancel a membership over that.", "They should be fired, I wouldn't let this go either..NTA, sorry that happened to you..but don't let two pathetic db's set you back.", "Nta but dont end your progress", "Nta. Next time you see them, walk up, glance at his crotch. \u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m guessing\u2026 7mm?", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThey were not guessing weights. They were judging and shaming people who are trying to improve their health. You did the right thing. \n\nWhen you are ready, you go back to that gym and take back that positive space.

That behavior is despicable and you would not be the AH if you reported it.\n\nNot that it matters, but because you said stone I'm wondering if you're from the UK which would make a size 12 a size *8* in the US--leaving aside the ridiculous vagaries of women's sizing, YOU ARE A GORGEOUS AND STRONG. That is a very average size, on the low end of \"medium\".

Honestly, it doesn't matter if that wouldn't bother some people, it's rude and disrespectful and should not be considered acceptable by management.

I'll never understand why people already in decent shape try to bully and discourage others who are trying to just get started on the road to fitness.\n\nI've seen this happen too many times to count and I don't know why it's so hard for these supposed alpha types to push back on the jackasses that discourage others.

As we were talking he said, \"a woman of your size needs....\" and he didn't intend it as someone who is thin but as someone who needs to lose weight. Yeah, I complained about him and I didn't join that gym. \n\nAnd I get not seeing yourself any differently.

Then when you lose more and get better you add more exercise so you don't injure your already stressed joints.    But then there's these AH instructors there to make fun of our looks and tell us how we're not doing enough because they ran 5k this morning.   Maddening.\n\nDo more, post a review of this place if these guys keep their jobs so you can warn others of their mocking.\n\nI've always said that gym \"instructors\" have killed more heavy people than McDonalds for this very reason.\n\nPS.

It\u2019s pathetic. You\u2019re a 10 and they said (gasp) that you were at 12. Get over it or tell the manager and watch them laugh and tell you to get over it. Stop letting other people\u2019s opinions impact you or cry to the manager and join the outrage culture.", "It is quite ambiguous, I agree!  OP said guessing weight which is why I guessed stone.  1 st = 14lbs so of course both could apply to a woman's weight!"]}
