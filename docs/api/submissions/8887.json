I hope you can find a new gym that has decent human beings in it. You deserve it. I hope the instructors have their T.V. remote chewed by a dog.", "NTA. They deserve it and should be severely sanctioned if not fired. If they're making you uncomfortable they're definitely making other members uncomfortable too.

Fuck those pigs!\n\n Edited to add you should follow up with management and make sure that they have been dealt with and let them know that you have ceased your membership. Perhaps they will reinstate a membership for you if you can get them to ensure that you will have a safe and non hostile space to work out in. \n\nOtherwise, I would straight up complain on social media if you've got a facebook, they shouldn't be making judgmental comments, they possibly could be discriminating against people as well since they're so concerned about judging people based upon appearance.

Then when you lose more and get better you add more exercise so you don't injure your already stressed joints.    But then there's these AH instructors there to make fun of our looks and tell us how we're not doing enough because they ran 5k this morning.   Maddening.\n\nDo more, post a review of this place if these guys keep their jobs so you can warn others of their mocking.\n\nI've always said that gym \"instructors\" have killed more heavy people than McDonalds for this very reason.\n\nPS.

Even if not i bet you look great however you look. I know your self-esteem won't let you believe it, but you really are. I have bad self esteem issues to the point that I used to believe before I had my first born I was over weight and chunky but looking back at those photos I wasn't I actually weighed on the lower average for my age group. I was bullied alot in school and my last year of school I had a stomach issue that made my stomach swell up a bit and people would make fun of me and talk behind my back and spread rumors I was pregnant when I wasn't.
