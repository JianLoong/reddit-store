Thoughout that time I have been deathly skinny and also been a bit chunky. Since being a teenager I\u2019ve had quite severe mental health issues and the gym has helped with that. I was able to come off of my anxiety medication as the gym got me into a good mental space. \n\nUntil recently I\u2019ve still felt anxious in the gym being the fat one but I got over it enough to go into the \u2018scary weights\u2019 section where all the weight lifters go. \n\nThe gym became my safe haven and I\u2019ve managed to lose 4 stone but I\u2019m still not thin. I went into the gym tonight and as I passed the front desk the gym instructors were guessing people\u2019s weight as they walked past.

Rating people as they walk in?  NTA they need to be fired.", "NTA.  I think you were entitled to not only tell their manager, but give them an earful, and file a complaint with their owners/company.  SO SO SO NTA", "NTA  \nWhat in the actual fuck, fuck those employees. The comments those gym employees make are the one of the reasons why people don't go to the gym, those comments just feed into people's insecurities. 100% report them because those are not the people you want at your gym.", "NTA \u2013 People working in fitness should be there to build people up, not tear them down.", "NTA, the gym instructors were being assholes for rating people coming in, doubly so for doing within earshot. I hope you can find a new gym that has decent human beings in it. You deserve it. I hope the instructors have their T.V. remote chewed by a dog.", "NTA. They deserve it and should be severely sanctioned if not fired. If they're making you uncomfortable they're definitely making other members uncomfortable too. It's important to let the gym know why they lost a long term member. \n\nAlso, please understand that these people are assholes and there is nothing wrong with you or your body. Be kind to yourself, and be proud of standing up for yourself.", "NTA. That was completely inappropriate & would likely bother most people.", "NTA. You come to the gym to exercise, and your goal is to lose some weight and be happy. No one should be judged for that, and no one should be commenting on it. I hope their manager handles it swiftly and firmly.", "NTA and those people are terrible. They shouldn't make assumptions and it's not their place to judge. Everybody has their own pace they work with and everybody does the best that they can- and if they're at least going to the gym, they're making progress! they're really trying. Fuck those pigs!\n\n Edited to add you should follow up with management and make sure that they have been dealt with and let them know that you have ceased your membership. Perhaps they will reinstate a membership for you if you can get them to ensure that you will have a safe and non hostile space to work out in. \n\nOtherwise, I would straight up complain on social media if you've got a facebook, they shouldn't be making judgmental comments, they possibly could be discriminating against people as well since they're so concerned about judging people based upon appearance. It's just a slippery slope with that type of shallow agenda going on.", "NTA , those staff members are assholes.", "NTA. They should absolutely lose their jobs over this.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, I know this sucks but they're just awful people and don't deserve the ability to affect your happiness.", "NTA\n\nTell the manager. \n\nThat kind of behaviour creates an incredibly toxic environment.", "NTA but this is far too common an experience in gyms and why I won\u2019t ever go back to them. How on Earth are people supposed to get healthy if you\u2019re gonna judge them and make them feel unwelcome. Ugh, posts like this make me hate humanity all over again. \n\nSorry you experienced this OP, you\u2019re smashing it and should be feeling so proud of yourself. Ignore what those dickwads were saying, hopefully their boss rips them a new one. But don\u2019t be put off your journey. Keep being awesome.", "NTA it's unprofessional and will cost the gym money and reputation.", "NTA !!!! Omg how inappropriate and disgusting \u2026 especially as trainers, I wouldn\u2019t trust a single one of them. & congrats OP on the weight loss, it\u2019s very difficult and you should be super proud of yourself.", "Not a all. That is totally inappropriate especially knowing people at a gym is probably insecure about their size to begin with.", "NTA.  They were being rude.  They have no business being instructors if that's how they view and treat customers.", "NTA, they're essentially gym employees standing at the gym entrance and insulting paying customers(assuming a paid membership)\n\nBut if a gym helps you then go try and find a new one or get some home equipment. I know it will likely remind you of this for a while but it sounds like going to a gym has done a lot more good for you than bad.", "NTA. That\u2019s ridiculously bad for business. I\u2019d cancel a membership over that.", "They should be fired, I wouldn't let this go either..NTA, sorry that happened to you..but don't let two pathetic db's set you back.", "Nta but dont end your progress", "Nta. Next time you see them, walk up, glance at his crotch. \u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m guessing\u2026 7mm?", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThey were not guessing weights. They were judging and shaming people who are trying to improve their health. You did the right thing. \n\nWhen you are ready, you go back to that gym and take back that positive space. You have worked hard and made awesome progress! 16 to 10 is a huge achievement - not to mention being mentally strong enough to kick your anxiety meds! You deserve to relish in that success and keep it going. Don't give up because some insecure asshats have no decency.", "NTA - this is completely inappropriate behavior for the staff", "NTA\n\nManager wants to know that. Who knows what business they've lost from that kind of attitude.\n\nUnless the manager doesn't care. Maybe this is the attitude they also have. \n\nIt means you'll have to decide if you're OK working out in that environment and giving your money to people like that, or find somewhere else to workout.", "OP, I'm so sorry this happened to you. That behavior is despicable and you would not be the AH if you reported it.\n\nNot that it matters, but because you said stone I'm wondering if you're from the UK which would make a size 12 a size *8* in the US--leaving aside the ridiculous vagaries of women's sizing, YOU ARE A GORGEOUS AND STRONG. That is a very average size, on the low end of \"medium\". (Even if you were a US 12 this is still toxic bc wtf, leave people alone about their damn bodies, but if you're across the pond this is just further evidence of how ludicrous and disgusting these jerks are.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if they were just other customers of the gym that would be terrible, but as staff that's absolutely unacceptable. Honestly, it doesn't matter if that wouldn't bother some people, it's rude and disrespectful and should not be considered acceptable by management.

They should both be fired, trainers are a dime a dozen anyway.", "NTA. This is one of the most frustrating things new gym goers deal with. I'll never understand why people already in decent shape try to bully and discourage others who are trying to just get started on the road to fitness.\n\nI've seen this happen too many times to count and I don't know why it's so hard for these supposed alpha types to push back on the jackasses that discourage others.

As we were talking he said, \"a woman of your size needs....\" and he didn't intend it as someone who is thin but as someone who needs to lose weight. Yeah, I complained about him and I didn't join that gym. \n\nAnd I get not seeing yourself any differently. I couldn't see it either until a friend of mine put together a collage of pics from before, during and after the weight loss. That was a game changer for how I saw myself.", "NTA.
