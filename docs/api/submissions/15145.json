Thank you for sticking to your ethics so someone who actually needed a disabled space would have the opportunity to get it.", "NTA. It is illegal, the discussion should have ended there.

I loathe those types of people. It's not some \"special thing\" you get that they don't and it's \"unfair\"...it's an accomidation...for the fact that you are less capable in some manner from an able bodied person from walking long distances. SIL is treating it like fast Pass at disney ffs.", "I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume the laws are the same everywhere and say this is actually illegal. She uses your placard and gets caught, you will lose your placard forever. Plus there\u2019s astronomical fines involved. NTA.", "NTA\u2014 it *would* be a big deal if you lent it out. In some states (assuming you\u2019re American) you run the risk of losing your pass entirely. That is not a risk you can take, especially not for something as minor as making you SIL\u2019s life slightly more convenient.", "NTA. And I don\u2019t know what the laws are where you live, but where I live that would be illegal.
