Thank you!!!! NTA!", "Why the fuck do so many people buy cars when they can't even handle using them?  NTA", "Absolutely not. I can't tell you the amount of times I have had people at the hospitals workers or at other locations different businesses encourage me to just park in the handicap space because I have a handicap sticker.\n\nIt's not mine, it's my dad's. He's the one who needs it not me. So for me to park in a spot that I don't need would absolutely run the risk of taking away from somebody who does need it. It's completely unethical disrespectful minimizing.\n\nI flip out on those people when they tell me to park there it's ridiculous I'm like my father needs a spot and if somebody like me took it and he came up what would he then do?", "NTA. My late father had the disability tag for most of my life (car accident left him using a cane). Was not an easy process for him to get approved (this was in the 90\u2019s). He would sometimes offer for us to use if we were going shopping but I always turned him down- I know he was just trying to be a nice dad but it always bugged me when people parked in handicap spots without the tag so I couldn\u2019t be like them. Wanting to take a spot from someone who needs it for your own convenience is pretty terrible considering how difficult it already is to have a disability in this world (especially in US)", "There\u2019s a special place in hell for people who misuse those badges. \n\nNTA", "Op, your are a good person, your sil is not. Have a good day.  NTA", "Did she drive herself to her own surgery? Why didnt she get dropped off at the door while the other person parked? Hospitals here usually have a valet process,  does yours not?  If she couldn't find anyone to drive her,  she could've ubered to the hospital and not had to worry about parking.... she had plenty of options that don't involve committing crimes and putting your benefits at risk..", "NTA\n\ni have a blue badge and the only time i ever use it is on my university campus and whenever i go anywhere where there's no other parking spots, plus times when i don't think i can walk that far that day. it's your badge, no one else is permitted to use it.", "I wish my campus security would do this. Instead they seem to think it\u2019s ok to park IN the limited disability spaces. I have trouble parking in front of my own dorm some days because students think it\u2019s a waiting zone, security and maintenance think they\u2019re allowed to park there for hours on end.", "That's infuriating. \n\nI haven't been in college for a while now, but mine was in the middle of Brooklyn, NYC - so you could imagine parking was at an absolutely premium. My school actually devoted a few spaces for security and maintenance vehicles only, separate from handicap spaces, and they were RUTHLESS about enforcing them.", "I can't upvote you enough", "Exactly! I look very able bodied without my cane which I\u2019ve been leaving at home more to get better at walking without assistance. However I have a heart condition and chronic leg pain, my dr deemed it necessary for me to have that placard.", "I take care of my mom and she has one but does not drive. I use it when she is with me for her appointments. Some days, she walks in with her walker and other days (no energy, extra sore/pain) I push her in in her wheelchair. The thought never crossed my mind to use it without her. That\u2019s just rude, disrespectful and illegal. Those spots are for people who really need them not lazy entitled assholes. \n\nYou are NTA but your sil sure is.", "I have a disability parking pass and I don\u2019t even park in the accessible spaces when I\u2019m at work since I\u2019m there for 8 hours and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to customers if my car was there for 8 hours.", "LOL Yeah, the old stand in 1 place without moving & you look like everyone else who's standing still!\n\neta I hate that 1.", "NTA\n\nI have a disabled parking placard (need to use a walker) and can tell you, at least in the US, there are almost NEVER enough parking places for the disabled (most places only have about two spaces painted blue).", "NTA. SIL needs crash course in boundaries. You didn't \"make\" her do anything. I seriously can't believe she'd even ask you for your pass, much less blast you later for it. Not even a debate.", "NTA. Thank you for being so ethical. Going through your history of posts, your SIL sounds like a total nightmare.", "NTA\n\nShe has no right to ask that of you.", "NTA Ive been in a wheelchair since 'birth' and people like your sil piss me off.", "NTA, you can get in major trouble for loaning out your placard. Including losing it.", "NTA. With parking being limited like it is, you potentially saved a single mother from having to push her wheel-chair bound child from down the road. She would\u2019ve felt really foolish if she had come out of the doctor\u2019s office and seen the consequences of her selfish actions.\n\nOr maybe not because she doesn\u2019t seem to be the type to have any scruples.", "NTA. If she has a medical or psychological condition that makes a few minutes walk over flat pavement painful or debilitating, she can talk to her own doc about getting her own placard. But being lazy and entitled is not actually a disability, and she shouldn't be blocking access to accomodations that other people need just because she thinks the sun shinrs out of her own ass.\n\nAlso, Idk about where you are, but here you lose your placard and get a massive fine if someone other than the person the placard was issued uses it to park in a disabled space.", "NTA - you need the badge, and it would be taken away if misuse was reported /established.  Also, SIL doesn\u2019t NEED a disabled parking space, and would likely be taking it from someone who did.", "NTA-I have a pass for my daughter. I never park in disabled parking if she\u2019s not with me because it\u2019s her pass! People get them because they really need them. It\u2019s bad enough we get yelled at for parking in the spots by others who assume we are fakers (until we pull out her wheelchair), or even seniors who say we can just walk from farther away. But the thing is-doctors give them out so lives and days are made easier and slightly more accessible for a very inaccessible world. It\u2019s not for keeping poor SIL from having to walk with *checks notes* anxiety."]}
