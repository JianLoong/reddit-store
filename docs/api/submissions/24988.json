Your aunt is, and a rather conceited one at that. If she\u2019s so concerned about seeing a warped image of her body, I suggest a funhouse mirror.", "NTA.  She's probably used to taking above angle pictures of herself for social media.", "NTA.\n\nShe seems exasperating... Well, she kept on pressing the issue and eventually got the honest low down.", "NTA.  Sometimes people perversely provoke you into telling them the truth.  By continuously insulting and annoying you about her pictures, your aunt wanted you to confirm what she already knew about herself.", "She kept at you which was rude. She should have sucked up the truth. NTA in any way. Anyone on her side is an AH too.", "Here\u2019s an idea for you OP.  Your aunt is no longer allowed to use your photography services for any reason.

I think it's understandable that you snapped but what you said was also mean. \n\nhowever Just bc she was a dick doesn't mean you have to be a bigger one. \n\nI would have said that she's wrong about your photography skills and is insulting you. I would have then tried to get support from the rest of the family. IF she persisted I would've said it's in her mind if she looks bad and that you won't take her photo in the future.\n\nfamily is tough some ppl are always unfair so I wouldn't value their opinions too highly", "ESH. YTA for agreeing with her that 'fat' looks 'bad'.", "Your not the asshole for saying it. But did you say it infront of the whole family? If so that was an asshole move. I would have asked her to speak to her in private. I would have said I\u2019m sorry that you feel my pictures make you feel unflattering, but this is a true reflection of how you look. Unfortunately I won\u2019t be able to take any more photos of you again since you are not happy with my work.  If she said your work was bad and wanting a refund I would then say I can not change the way my subject looks and leave it at that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
