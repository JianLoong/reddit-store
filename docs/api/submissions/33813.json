Or if she sold some jewelry / expensive items that she had to fund this purchase? Or if she was gifted Christmas money from family, and used that long with her own personal money? \n\nFrom his post, it doesn't seem like she spent her OWN personal money, but without knowing how the finances are divided, or where the money for the purchase came from, it seems like jumping to conclusions to make a decision", "I would still be pretty upset if there were rumors about possible layoffs, and my husband didn't tell me immediately as a part of the \"how was your day today?\" kind of thing. I also think if there was an \"AITA; I knew about possible layoffs and never told my wife, she made a large purchase with her own money, and now my pending layoff is putting us in a bad situation. I called her an asshole for not asking me before spending her own money, because I would have told her I might lose my job and that she can't spend her own money right now, and she said I'm TA for not telling her about the possible layoffs right away\", we know what the Reddit hivemind would say.\n\nThe \"own money\" thing is tricky for me. My husband and I have one joint account, so we know each other's spending, and talk before any big or out of the norm purchases (like many people on her have said they do).\n\nAt the same time, my husband also has multiple expensive items that he's purchased on his own (guns and cars). He does not consult me before selling a gun or car to purchase another one; because it's his item, his \"money\", and his purchase. We also have open communication about our jobs (which most marriages should have, otherwise there are larger issues at hand than just spending), so the \"what if you are about to lose your job\" thing shouldn't be an issue?\n\nFrom OPs post it doesn't seem like this purchase was made with his wife's own money completely, but without knowing that, I'm not going to call her an AH", "Even if she spent her own 5k, wouldn't you be pissed that your supposed to be happy 1/3 of your living room is filled with an expensive gift you never wanted?"]}
