The land appreciated because of the work you and your wife put into it.", "NTA\n\nIf he had invested his half of the money into literally anything else, would he share the fruits of that investment with you? I don\u2019t think so.\nYou had all the work transforming the place and you had all the risk of it not working too!\nAlso it definitely sounds like you invested some of your own money too to make all that possible. \nHe wants all the fruits of the labour without doing any of the labour \n\nI get that you don\u2019t want to loose him, so maybe there is a calm way to talk about all of this? With a mediator present or something like that?\nHe needs to understand that you invested the money and succeeded, but I mean you could have failed too, and if you did would he just give you money from his half?", "NTA\n\nThe only way I could side with your brother would be if you took advantage of his grieving and bought his share. I do doubt this as a possibility considering it must have taken sometime for your wife to convince you to give up your career to suddenly become a farmer - also it's been 10 years and he hasn't mentioned any regret during that time?\n\nI think it's clear your brother is having money troubles or perhaps a mid-life crisis. Either way he got a fair deal for his share. If he wants back in he can offer to repurchase his half.", "NTA.  You bought out your brother at the market price.  After that you and your wife came up with a great idea, and poured your money and lives into it.  It took a lot of work, money and courage to do what you did, and it worked.  \n\nit\u2019s Too bad your brother can\u2019t see the hard work you and your wife put into this.  He can\u2019t just walk in at this point and expect to be part of it.\n\nI hope he reconsiders in the future.", "NTA\n\nHe sold it to you at market value because he didn't want anything to do with it.

Also, he is not the only family you have left.  Family can be more than blood, for example, your wife.", "It sucks that he's the only family left but what you did was fair and square. Now that you guys have put in the hard work and money he wants to reap the rewards. Not cool.\n\nNta", "NTA. It is sad that your brother is jealous of your and your wife's success. He didn't have the vision, didn't put in the work or the money, but wants to reap the rewards.", "Is this an advert or AITA? Ahaha NTA\n\nHe could've used that money to invest. Instead he used it for what most people do I suppose, which is reasonable. It's what I would do. He gets to live an overall stress free life.", "NTA - You and your wife did all the work, planning, ideas, went into debt and paid off the debt. He did nothing.", "NTA. Your brother would have never turned that land into what you and your wife did. Even if he kept it. He didn\u2019t have the vision that your genius wife had. Of course now he wants in, and he\u2019s guilting you, but realistically he can\u2019t claim anything here. I\u2019d say nope. Also because in a few years the children will be involved and then it would be not be just you, your wife and your brother but all the cousins. It\u2019ll be messy. You guys had the idea, you guys put in the work, enjoy the fruits of your labor with your children and hopefully many generations to come.", "NTA\n\nYou paid your brother a fair market price for his share of the land.  If you were interested in a business partnership, your brother would need to buy in at the current fair market price of the business.  \n\nYour brother has no more right to your business than you do to his house that he purchased with some of the proceeds.", "NTA.  If you paid fair market value, that's that.  It takes a lot of initiative to do that level of improvement to the property and your brother is not entitled to those benefits if he didn't participate.", "Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure if the business was failing, he would insist he got paid too much and give you the money back. \n\nNTA", "NTA, he got what he wanted. You and your wife worked hard. He\u2019s just greedy and jealous. He was paid his fair share. If he wanted in on the business, he shouldn\u2019t have sold his share to you. He should have helped you build the business.", "NTA in any way my friend, buyers remorse sucks but he was paid fairly. If you dont want him in it that's your choice.", "NTA- he got his share, then you were smart with yours, put lots of money into it and now have the rewards.   He isnt owed anything.", "NTA I would be sympathetic if he really just wanted to be a part of the family business for sentimental reasons. But he's made it perfectly clear that his motives are purely financial, and after he had the audacity to imply he wasn't paid fairly, simply because he missed out on a great opportunity that he had *nothing* to do with, tells me involving your brother in any way will come back to bite you.\n\nIt's no coincidence he only came around now that you and your wife are living it up after putting in the effort for all those years to build this business *without your brother.*", "NTA.\n\nI assume he agreed on the price at the time, and assuming it was market value, then it's fair.\n\nYou took all the risks involved in the business and have well deserved the success you have optained.\n\nI think it might be nice to let your brother work for you, or let him buy in at what it's worth now.", "NTA\n\nYou paid market value. That was perfectly fair. The difference between when you bought the property and now is 100% due to your work and investment.\n\nIf you want your brother as a partner. Tell him he can buy in at half of the current value of the property and business. If you don\u2019t want him as a partner. Tell him no thank you.", "NTA - He's not entitled to the market value gained from your work.", "NTA\n\nYou paid market price for what you received and built it into something amazing.   You did the work.", "NTA", "NTA. You both got what could reasonably be considered half of the inheritance, which was as fair as it could possibly be. The fact that you got more out of what you received does not make him entitled to more of yours.", "NTA - I'd tell you to offer him a job, but it's clear he wants all the benefits without working for them. So I'd doubt he'd be happy with that offer. Plus, he'd almost certainly be a poor employee with a major chip on his shoulder.", "NTA - you gave him a fair price for his half and now he wants the profits from all your hard work.  That's not how it works!!!  I somehow doubt he would make a very good partner, even if he was willing to \"buy in\" and you certainly dont't owe him anything more.   \n Congratulations on building such a wonderful business!", "NTA he chose what to do with his money you chose what to do with yours. You aren\u2019t responsible for him or his choices.", "NTA, don't even entertain the idea of him doing anything with your business, if you do it'll just escalate to 'our business' and trying to manipulate equity out of you.

The business you bought was a farm and you changed it into something totally different through you hard work. He did nothing to help transform the farm into a thriving business. Its a family business for sure. YOUR FAMILY.", "NTA. You gave him a fair split when your father died. Did he even ask what you planned to do with the farm when you bought him out?", "NTA. It seems like your wife used her background to turn nothing into something for the both of you. If this venture had been a massive failure, would your brother bail you out?", "NTA. Agri-tourism is huge right now. Great job getting in on that market! He didn't put in any of the money, work, or risk that you did.

I asked about it elsewhere, so maybe OP will clarify. But, brother wasn't forced to sell.", "If it was an advert, it would have been way better, because my wife would write it.

What you have done is NOT without insane amounts of work and dedication.", "NTA. He could have invested in your business instead of selling his half of the estate outright and taken on any amount of the risk which you took on by starting a new business. He's just being greedy. If you're really feeling generous, offer him the chance to buy some stock and/or offer him a job working at the business, but he didn't take on any of the risk so he doesn't get any of the rewards.", "NTA.

He can invest back in for a proportional percentage of the profits. If he doesn\u2019t like that, he\u2019s trying to take advantage of you. If he\u2019s willing to take a fair deal, such as buy back in at 10%, pay 10% of the costs per year and get 10% of the profits, or whatever sounds fair to you, then he\u2019s more interested in a good investment opportunity than just trying to take advantage of you. But make sure lawyers are involved so no one gets screwed over.", "NTA - he was paid fair market value, and only wants back in because you're making a lot of money. It's your business you do not have to allow him to work for you, not to mention it's pretty difficult working with family. I work for my mother's company and although it's not difficult because of her my brother-in-law feels he owns the company and is pretty difficult to deal with", "NTA\n\nYour brother just admitted that he wants your money not a relationship with you. \n\nNext time he'll claim that you don't love his children.", "Tell him he would have to buy into 1/3 of the businesses at current market value + pay you and your wife fair compensation for the work you put into it for 10 years. Surely a valuation of a few millions.\n\nEdit:  NTA", "NTA. He feels entitled to your success but did nothing to help it. Sulky little boy.", "In addition to accepting the buy out...\n\n* It wasn't his idea\n* It wasn't his effort for the last 10 years\n* He didn't go into debt to build what you have\n* Is he offering some $$ for the now value of what you have?\n\nHe has some gall to be mad because you don't allow him to \"take over\" your work.", "Right. If it\u2019s the other way around and OP\u2019s business tanked, he would not have the right to ask his brother for money because he \u201coverpaid\u201d.\n\nGood on you OP, his jealousy is not your responsibility, and you could focus on the family you have, and not the family who does not want to be there.", "This! I wish I could upvote it many times over.", "NTA, because if you\u2019re venture swapped he wouldn\u2019t be splitting his money with you.", "Hi OP.  You did nothing wrong, NTA at all.  But this is your brother that you love.  Sounds like he\u2019s going through a rough patch and could use some support.  You might offer a free weekend for him and his family.  You could take his kids and teach them farming, etc and maybe give Bro and SIL a nice weekend to themselves.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s owed nothing, this would just be a small kindness to keep the relationship going", "Please don't forget your wife is your family too!", "No NTA\n\nAnd him going NC is a favor not a punishment.

Don\u2019t waste any thought on your brother", "NTA.  If your business had not done well, and you lost money, would your brother have been willing to give you some of that money back to help get you out of debt?  Probably not. And he would not be an AH either, under that circumstance.\n\nThat said, if you want to maintain a relationship with him, and he is willing to actually put in the work, you could consider hiring him into the business. You are under no obligation to do so, however... especially if he does not have the needed skills to help or if you think he will just be a leech.", "NTA. You paid him what the land was worth at the time. He was probably thrilled at the time to be rid of it and have the money. What if your venture failed? Would he buy it back to help you? I\u2019m sure he would not. He shouldn\u2019t expect to benefit from your hard work and success.", "NTA, he could have invested his money and take the risk like you dud, that's not the type of family you want near you and your wife believe me.", "NTA. He\u2019s just mad your wife multiplied your inheritance while he squandered his.", "Your brother chose his path.NTA", "NTA\n\nYou said he's all the \"family\" you have left.

It's not your brother's.\n\nRemind your brother that you both inherited equally, you paid him market value, got no discount for being his brother and that he used his inheritance and he chose & so did you.  If he chooses not to speak with you then obviously he only cared about money and not his brother.", "NTA, tell him he can join the business if you can own half of all his assets...", "NTA. You and your wife are what made the land profitable. He got his fair share.", "I would suggest that you tell your brother that you would love to be in the family business with him, ask him to invest 45 percent and get a contract that he has to put 45 percent of the work that the income brings in. Bet he will say no. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou built this business. You made this property profitable with your own money and your own hard work.

It\u2019s not even really the same business your father ran - you completely transformed it.\n\nStarting your own business was a gamble - and it happened to have paid off. Would he be willing to pay back some of that money if the market value dropped?\n\nHe chose a different opportunity, and that\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not okay is looking at what you have now and based on that feeling of regret, accuse you of wrongdoing.\n\nAlso wow, your wife\u2019s background in business and hospitality. That mattered here, I think.\n\nAnd for the record, you didn\u2019t owe your brother an interest in your business anyway.", "Considering where you live: Culturally speaking is what your brother asking for out of line? A bunch of Americans of course would say he has no right to your success. But we\u2019re Americans. We\u2019re really big on individuality and go-it-alone success stories. \n\nOther countries can see this sort of thing very differently. If it\u2019s not crazy for him to ask for a piece is there something he is good that that he can contribute to the venture? Could he actually be an asset to the business?", "NTA\n\nHe can argue to buy in at fair market rate thst includes cost of investment, matinence, and a generous wage for the sweat equity you and your wife put in.

Brother needs to learn to appreciate what he has.\n\nOP, if you want to offer some type of olive branch, how old are your brother's kids?

He just wants to reap the rewards.", "Sounds like OP and his wife were just dreaming up an idea (\"vauge ideas\"). \n\nHonestly these kinds of things fail more reguarly than they suceed. I'm guessing OP's wife's degrees/experience made a big difference here, and I'm. sure they put in many hard yards, but it was still a huge risk.\n\nMost sensible people wouldn't buy in to it, and in any case doing so would be complicated due to trying to value time/labour invested.\n\nGood on OP and his wife for making it work.", "Yep.

Would he have given OP his money back if the farm/resort had failed?", "I don't know why people are even bringing it up.\n\nAll OP did was buy some land from his brother - that's it.\n\nOPs brother contributed nothing to the business. The business wasn't there before OP made serious upgrades to the farm and created it."]}
