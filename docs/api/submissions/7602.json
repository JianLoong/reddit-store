The land appreciated because of the work you and your wife put into it.", "NTA\n\nIf he had invested his half of the money into literally anything else, would he share the fruits of that investment with you? I don\u2019t think so.\nYou had all the work transforming the place and you had all the risk of it not working too!\nAlso it definitely sounds like you invested some of your own money too to make all that possible. \nHe wants all the fruits of the labour without doing any of the labour \n\nI get that you don\u2019t want to loose him, so maybe there is a calm way to talk about all of this? With a mediator present or something like that?\nHe needs to understand that you invested the money and succeeded, but I mean you could have failed too, and if you did would he just give you money from his half?", "NTA\n\nThe only way I could side with your brother would be if you took advantage of his grieving and bought his share. I do doubt this as a possibility considering it must have taken sometime for your wife to convince you to give up your career to suddenly become a farmer - also it's been 10 years and he hasn't mentioned any regret during that time?\n\nI think it's clear your brother is having money troubles or perhaps a mid-life crisis. Either way he got a fair deal for his share. If he wants back in he can offer to repurchase his half.", "NTA.  You bought out your brother at the market price.  After that you and your wife came up with a great idea, and poured your money and lives into it.  It took a lot of work, money and courage to do what you did, and it worked.  \n\nit\u2019s Too bad your brother can\u2019t see the hard work you and your wife put into this.

Instead he used it for what most people do I suppose, which is reasonable. It's what I would do. He gets to live an overall stress free life.", "NTA - You and your wife did all the work, planning, ideas, went into debt and paid off the debt. He did nothing.", "NTA. Your brother would have never turned that land into what you and your wife did. Even if he kept it. He didn\u2019t have the vision that your genius wife had. Of course now he wants in, and he\u2019s guilting you, but realistically he can\u2019t claim anything here. I\u2019d say nope. Also because in a few years the children will be involved and then it would be not be just you, your wife and your brother but all the cousins. It\u2019ll be messy. You guys had the idea, you guys put in the work, enjoy the fruits of your labor with your children and hopefully many generations to come.", "NTA\n\nYou paid your brother a fair market price for his share of the land.

He should have helped you build the business.", "NTA in any way my friend, buyers remorse sucks but he was paid fairly. If you dont want him in it that's your choice.", "NTA- he got his share, then you were smart with yours, put lots of money into it and now have the rewards.   He isnt owed anything.", "NTA I would be sympathetic if he really just wanted to be a part of the family business for sentimental reasons. But he's made it perfectly clear that his motives are purely financial, and after he had the audacity to imply he wasn't paid fairly, simply because he missed out on a great opportunity that he had *nothing* to do with, tells me involving your brother in any way will come back to bite you.\n\nIt's no coincidence he only came around now that you and your wife are living it up after putting in the effort for all those years to build this business *without your brother.*", "NTA.\n\nI assume he agreed on the price at the time, and assuming it was market value, then it's fair.\n\nYou took all the risks involved in the business and have well deserved the success you have optained.\n\nI think it might be nice to let your brother work for you, or let him buy in at what it's worth now.", "NTA\n\nYou paid market value. That was perfectly fair. The difference between when you bought the property and now is 100% due to your work and investment.\n\nIf you want your brother as a partner. Tell him he can buy in at half of the current value of the property and business. If you don\u2019t want him as a partner. Tell him no thank you.", "NTA - He's not entitled to the market value gained from your work.", "NTA\n\nYou paid market price for what you received and built it into something amazing.   You did the work.", "NTA", "NTA. You both got what could reasonably be considered half of the inheritance, which was as fair as it could possibly be. The fact that you got more out of what you received does not make him entitled to more of yours.", "NTA - I'd tell you to offer him a job, but it's clear he wants all the benefits without working for them. So I'd doubt he'd be happy with that offer. Plus, he'd almost certainly be a poor employee with a major chip on his shoulder.", "NTA - you gave him a fair price for his half and now he wants the profits from all your hard work.

What you have done is NOT without insane amounts of work and dedication.", "NTA. He could have invested in your business instead of selling his half of the estate outright and taken on any amount of the risk which you took on by starting a new business. He's just being greedy.

If he\u2019s willing to take a fair deal, such as buy back in at 10%, pay 10% of the costs per year and get 10% of the profits, or whatever sounds fair to you, then he\u2019s more interested in a good investment opportunity than just trying to take advantage of you. But make sure lawyers are involved so no one gets screwed over.", "NTA - he was paid fair market value, and only wants back in because you're making a lot of money. It's your business you do not have to allow him to work for you, not to mention it's pretty difficult working with family.

It's not your brother's.\n\nRemind your brother that you both inherited equally, you paid him market value, got no discount for being his brother and that he used his inheritance and he chose & so did you.

It\u2019s not even really the same business your father ran - you completely transformed it.\n\nStarting your own business was a gamble - and it happened to have paid off. Would he be willing to pay back some of that money if the market value dropped?\n\nHe chose a different opportunity, and that\u2019s fine.

You and your wife succeeded through your imagination, initiative, your hard work, your teamwork and your vision.  Your brother played no role in that and is not entitled to what you have worked for.  \n\nJust for giggles, put together a data collection of the property value then and all that building that cost you and your wife.  Don\u2019t forget the things you didn\u2019t buy for yourselves as you used what you had to build your business.  Let him see what buying into your business would cost him.  Ask him which part of your successful business he was personally responsible for because you don\u2019t remember his making any investment.  Ask him to put you on the deed to his house, his cars, all the things his money purchased for him and his family have enjoyed.  Tell him how unfair it is that he had all that while you and your wife were climbing out of debt.", "NTA. no need to feel guilty for taking a leap and turning  your father's farm into something profitable.\n\nHe's definitely being an A here, especially cutting off contact. \n\nIt's hard to have too much sympathy for brother when this is almost certainly about money...It certainly wasn't presented as my brother wants to help or to be able to spend more time together...\n\nI dunno. You don't owe him anything here, so don't feel badly if you decide to keep on keeping on, but there may be some way to let him in on the business. \n\nWould you consider letting him work with you or invest some sweat equity and after a few years give him the option of buying a small share.", "NTA.   Your brother is just greedy and regretful.\n\nHe now wants the benefit of a business you\u2019ve made successful, without the hard work, risk and headaches you had to to go through to make it successful\n\nThe only fair option is for you to work out current market value and he can buy a share of that. (if you even want him involved that is).  If you do this though, make sure you have control and it\u2019s clear to him what is role and authority is.\n\nAlso, even if he was right and he was underpaid (which I don\u2019t believe he was), his argument would be to ask for more money to what he thinks it was worth when he sold it.  It doesn\u2019t give him the right to have shares in the business.", "NTA you bought him out at market price, what you and your wife chose to do with the land has nothing to do with him. He has no leg to stand on.", "NTA.\n\nIt's hard that he is your only (original) family, and he's not talking to you. You do have more family (the closest being your wife).\n\nI give importance to you not wanting to lose an important family relationship. However, you also have to think about what kind of relationship you can expect to have with your brother going forward. He was happy with the deal at the time. He doesn't think about the time, money, and energy you and your wife put into your business. He doesn't think about the drastic change to your lifestyle needed to make this business happen. He doesn't think about how - had the business not thrived - he wouldn't have felt any obligation to give you the purchase price back; he took no risk at all.\n\nSo the brother you have before you now is one who wants you to take on all the risk, make the sacrifices, and do the work so that he can reap the benefits and pay nothing toward it. If you agree to his terms, he will never stop leaching from you. What kind of relationship is that?\n\nIf you and he are able to have a decent conversation and he recognizes that his expectation is completely wrong, then it may be possible (but I have big doubts) that you could offer to host something (a double family vacation, his family vacationing on the farm for a week or two for free, etc.) that his family could not otherwise easily enjoy. I mention the possibility but heavily caution you to read your brother's current character and perspective carefully. Otherwise, it could be more of a mess and more unpleasant and an unappreciated gesture of goodwill.\n\nThere is no doubt that you do not owe him any of the fruits of your investment and hard work.", ">Now he says that he wants in on the business, that what he was paid was not fair. \n\n\"You received money you were happy with.  I put my wife and mines money and years of effort into what we bought with ours.  You had nothing to do with our success, and you deserve none of it.  Keep your hand out of my wallet.\"\n\nNTA", "So NTA.  Not even close.  \nIt's sucks because jealousy can destroy family relationships, but if that happens it's on him.   \nYou gave him FMV. Your wife convinced you to give it a shot and it worked out.  \nYou should feel amazing about that and your brother should be happy for you.  \nIt's too bad he's busy counting other people's money.", "NTA, he got market value for the land and he's had no part in creating the thriving business you now have!", "NTA. You may want to point out how much cash you had to invest to get the business to this point, as well as the value of the hours you and your wife put into the business to get it going, and keep it running.\n\nonce he realizes how much was spent to get it to the point it is now, it may help him see logic, here.\n\nor, you could always ask him if he would expect the same had a developer or a stranger bought the two of you out and made improvements as you and your wife did.\n\nhe may be your only brother, but it seems like you are the only one worried about your relationship as brothers.", "NTA. I'm sorry your brother turns out to be...well...the kind of person he is. The kind of person who would cut off his only blood relation because he was unable to extract money that he didn't work for and isn't owed.\n\nYour intelligent, hard-working wife and your children are your family. Please surround yourself with loving friends and create a family of choice.  \n\nYou would have to literally buy your brother with money he doesn't deserve for him to behave like a brother, let alone the kind of brother you deserve.  It's very sad, but I think you have to let go.", "NTA. your wife is more family to you then your gold digging brother", "Shame on your brother for letting his greed ruin the family. I\u2019m sorry for your loss for your last family member but if this was what it took to break the relationship, then he was already lost.", "Nta. And I'd live to visit if you wouldn't mind sharing over PM where you're located.", "NTA. You guys worked hard for the past 5 years. Does he plan to give you part of everything his hard work has brought him in the last 5 years, too?", "NTA. You paid him for his share of the property before you started the business.  So unless he can afford to buy into your business there is nothing really to talk about.  Well unless he becomes your employee, but he'd only be getting a salary, not a share in the business.", "NTA \nIf he wants in to the new family business ask him to pay a mutual firm for a business evaluation. See the value and let him buy in for 40% of total net worth. Then watch him choke on it. Money talk and bullshit walks as they used to say where I grew up.", "Nta, of course it's worth more. You and your wife did all of the hard work to grow the business. Your brother is selfish and deserves nothing except for what he was already paid.", "NTA.  Also, your title reminded me of a fun little song. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlDGFrP4NgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlDGFrP4NgI)", "NTA\n\nYour wife is your family too. It\u2019s a \u2018family business\u2019 because you two created it. It didn\u2019t exist before then. But it\u2019s a bit of a false name to call it a family business because in most peoples understanding a \u2018family business\u2019 is a multigenerational business that has been passed down to you.\n\nYou paid market value for the land. Your brother didn\u2019t contribute the land to your project. He was paid off and was happy with what he received at the time. Your business had a likelihood of failure more than a likelihood of success, would he have wanted to share in your failure and give you your money back if the business didn\u2019t work out? No, because nobody works like that. He isn\u2019t an investor, he isn\u2019t a co-worker, he hasn\u2019t put anything into your business. He wants to come in now it\u2019s established and making money, but he didn\u2019t share your vision before.\n\nDon\u2019t give him a bean. He\u2019s doing ok in his middle class life.", "NTA. Greed makes people do stupid things.", "Your brother's a jealous child. You did well with your business, and now he wants another piece of the pie. No, you're nta. Sounds like a lovely business though. :)", "I mean if he paid back market value right now for it\u2026 but seriously NTA.", "He could have told you he was happy to see the old place thriving, filled with lovers starting their lives together, children, and growth.\n\nHe could have praised your wife\u2019s intelligence and business acumen.\n\nHe could have praised your hard work and sacrifices.\n\nInstead he led with resentment and entitlement to money he did not earn, and walked away from his own blood in anger.\n\nif there is an asshole here, it isn\u2019t you.", "I'm really kinda saying I think OPs brother would have been foolish to buy in to it, even if he had entertained the idea - as most people doing this don't begin to comprehend the amount of work that goes into such a venture, not to mention a good bit of luck, and sadly, with the best intentions, the business fails.\n\nOP and his wife were fortunate with the opportunity, but they will have worked for 100% of the benefits they now reap. It is well earned and none of the brothers concern.", "I agree. It was a huge risk. And, it seems like that at no point did the brother ask if there was anything he could do to help or tried to jump in early. He's just jealous and is trying to play off of familial guilt to get something for nothing.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s sad that his jealousy is causing this, but from the provided info, you have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. This is another one of those situations we\u2019ve seen in this subreddit where it\u2019s seller\u2019s remorse. \n\nHe sold at what he thought was a good value, spent all the money and is now jealous of what you\u2019ve guys put into the property.", "If at market rate, then nta, this is merely trying to swoopin afterthe hardship is over.", "NTA. But if you ever want a relationship with your brother again, you are probably gonna have to find a way to make it work.", "NTA, will he be giving you rent for his house? Will his children pay you once they get their degrees?", "NTA. He made his agreement and settled upon what he accepted. You and your wife put in the work to make it what it is today. All your parents did was leave an opportunity- your brother passed on the opportunity and took the cash.", "NTA", "NTA he only had complaints when you were successful.", "NTA, of course.", "NTA. He was given market value of his portion of the existing property. You have turned it into something different. If he wants in, he needs to buy in at market value of the existing business. I highly doubt he's going to want to do that.", "NTA and ahahahhahshahahshsh. No def NTA.", "NTA", "Your brother wouldn\u2019t think of approaching a complete stranger and saying \u201cyou brought my land and made it successful so now I want in on it\u201d so he shouldn\u2019t expect it of you. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe only way he should be given a piece of your business is if buys into it.", "NTA. He took the deal and bought a life. He\u2019s not happy you made a great life after taking a risk. \n\nWould he have helped if you failed?", "Why anything else? Sounds like the brother has a house and a car that he should be offering to repurchase half the farm. Not that OP is required to accept but he has some cheek not to even offer.", "The brother is family.... he can get mate's rates ona  weekend at the farm as a guest.  That's it.", "That's right. Even if OP's brother owned half the *land*, he could only charge rent to OP's business. He has no claim whatsoever to the profits.", "Dang this sounds awesome. I don\u2019t suppose you would be willing to PM me where it is? I have always wanted to try out farm life!\n\nEdit to add you are totally NTA", "Are you sure your bro is doing OK?", "NTA\n\nInvite him around. Take him on a detailed tour of all the features. At each point, explain what it cost in time and effort. Take lots of time over this. At the end of the tour ask him how much he contributed to that. Then say to him, you've heard the vast amount of investment it took for us to build this business from very little. Ask him how much money he has to put on the table to buy a non-controlling stake, based on the current valuation plus a hefty premium of your choice, in your business?", "NTA but can I just say I love the sound of your business! It sounds so beautiful and I'm so happy you and your wife make such a good team. As sad as it is that your brother is being kinda greedy and petty, I think you've got a really cool story. You should totally write a book if you haven't already, the creation of your business and farm would be so cool to read about!", "If your brother really would feel it's unfair he would come to you much sooner and not now when your business is blooming. Let's be honest - it's easier to work and collect profit each month rather than build a business slowly with many mistakes at the beginning. Why he did not come to you when you were starting with a help offer? Probably he didn't have enough patience to work hard or simply he didn't want to risk his career for something unstable at that time. I understand he's your only family however you have to set up some boundaries to not be used. Perhaps, he doesn't consider you as his only family when it comes to taking your hard-earned money. Seems to be greedy and jealous.", "If the two of you had sold the farm to a 3rd party who did what you did with it, would your brother be going up to that stranger and asking for part of their business? Of course not. This is no different. He sold his share of the farm. It doesn't matter who bought it, he has no claim on the land or the business you built on it. \n\nAlso, he knows the farm didn't just magically turn itself into an event & retreat center, right? Does he understand that the property is the location of the business but not technically the business itself? You could (in theory) sell him back a portion of the land and he wouldn't make any income off of it unless he used it to start his own business.\n\nThe only way he should get to be part of your business is if he's willing to be an investor. I don't know if you and your wife are looking for a business partner, but if you were, you'd need to figure out the current value of the business (not just the land it sits on), and how much of it you are willing to sell. If it's worth $1,000,000, and you're willing to give your brother 20% ownership, his buy-in would be $200,000. If you are not looking for business partner, then your brother is out of luck.", "Nta, but you don\u2019t mention children, you may forgo your brother but would you be willing to bring your niblings in under your wing? Start off small as farmhands, assisting with wedding as a waitstaff etc? Not saying you owe your brothers family anything at all, cause you don\u2019t. But maybe spread the love?", "NTA, it's not a family business, it's you and your wife's business, your brother was bought out.", "NTA it wasnt a business before - all you and your wife's hours of hard work and ideas and investment is what makes it what it is today.\n\nSo is he giving you half of the increase in market value of his home? Also half of what his kids start earning with the money used from the estate to pay their education? Is this how it works?\n\nTell him to go invest in land and recreate a similar set up to you if he wants a similar business. Demand is there. He wants money for nothing - and its not fair to your wife either to hand proceeds over. Do you have kids? Because thats their inheritance too.", "Tbh... if his reasoning wasn't that he allegedly got cheated out of a good deal but instead that he wants to try something new or he wants to work closer with you and your family or literally any other reason than \"You gave me not enough money for the land\" I would have come to another conclusion but with this exact reasoning: NTA.", "NTA!!! And I just wanna say WELL DONE to you for listening to your wife. You have truly found a wife. \n\nYour brother is not entitled to your hard work, and I know you probably don't want to lose him, but he isn't the only family you have left, you have your wife and your children and this is the only family you need. \n\nDon't give in to your brother, you will lose your wife if you do.", "NTA he may be family but he\u2019s also an asshole who sold his part of it, so he can go bite rocks.", "NTA...\n\nAlso\n//he is the only family I have left. //\nNot anymore...\nHis children and their generation might have been taught how you cheated them out of their family inheritance and made a fortune ...\n\nI'd say cut your loses lest it become a generation wise hatred", "NTA.

Your brother can't now claim your investment as part of the price of the land.", "Let him cool off. It wasnt the answer he was hoping for of course. But you are doing the correct thing. NTA", "NTA, you paid market value and bought him out; he no longer has a legal say over the property.", "NTA \n\nYour brothers logic is faulty. The value of your business comes from you and your wife's efforts, not the inherent value of the land. He got the value for that. \n\nThat would be like me going to an art store, buying a canvas, paints and brushes. Painting a masterpiece painting, selling it for $1,000,000(or your countries equivalent) and the store coming back saying they're entitled to half of that money because they sold me the art supplies. Sorry, it doesn't work that way.", "Nta\nHe got his fair share", "Congratulations to you on marrying such a smart woman and on the success of your business.\n\nNTA - he is using emotional blackmail and is jealous of your success.  He probably feels what you did was obvious, he could have done it, he should have done it but he didn't do it.  If your (your wife and your) business had not been a success, would he have compensated you for the loss?  \n\nHe isn't wrong - its a family business - YOUR family business.", "NTA. I want to your hotel. I love farmstays. Of this kind", "NTA", "NTA let\u2019s make a picture here: you inherited one sheep. Your brother didn\u2019t want a sheep and you did so you bought your brothers part of the sheep for what half a sheep goes for.\n\nNow your sheep have given wool, milk and had lambs who grew and gave more wool, milk and meat. And now your brother is saying he\u2019s entitled to all those products because he once owned half the original sheep\u2026..", "NTA. Is your relationship with your greedy brother important to you. If yes, ask yourself, if your business failed, would he have bailed you out?", "NTA", "Hmm - he seems to think that shared blood means you also have to share the results of your sweat and tears.  NTA - your investment, and no doubt very hard work, paid out better than his investments.   Life's like that sometimes, we can't go back in time and change the facts to suit us.", "No, no. This sets the wrong tone. He is family yes but a transaction is a transaction. Can you imagine if anyone did this in real estate? It's the equivalent of selling an outdated abandoned home, finding the purchaser did some awesome renovations and upped the home value, and suddenly the previous owner comes back saying \"No fair, this was my house I want in on this.\"", "That sounds fair.", "OP said the brother is living well, if he wants in on the business he can buy into it (assuming OP is at all interested in that).  Anythimg beyond that is just him demanding a hand out. \n\nHe was paid fair market value for the land, the fact that OP was then able to turn that fair market value land into a booming business is completely irrelevant. \n\nThat would be like me selling my house to someone who decided to flip it and resell at 3x the price they bought it at and then me demanding half of their profit. It has nothing to do with me once I sell it."]}
