I have been sober for 2 years and we are just now starting to have a relationship again. I can\u2019t be upset if she is the one he relies and leans on. If I had been more present and less drunk it might be different. The cancer she didn\u2019t have a choice in. The drug use she did. I am thankful my son has her and your mom should be also. Yet she is selfish.", "NTA - you weren't wrong with what you said. Just because your mom helped you with a downpayment on your apartment doesn't mean that she was there for you more than your stepmother. And the fact that she was a contributing factor in you getting hooked on drugs says to me that she wasn't a good mom to you. You do what you feel is right for you.", "Getting your kid hooked on drugs. That's a new symptom of addiction. Never heard of it before.", "NTA - Your Mom lent you money.  That doesn't mean that automatically entitles her access to other things in your life.  You communicated a hard truth and it was hurtful.  You have a complicated past.  It sounds like she is trying to make amends.  Hopefully, your relationship can adjust as she has a chance to become a Grandmother.", "NTA.  Your egg donor was barely a parent and giving you some money at this late stage doesn\u2019t make up for that.", "NTA. Not being there and being high all through your childhood and also introducing you to drug abuse are problems that can't be repaired with money. You only told her the fact that your stepmother is the one who has treated you like a mother should. Therefore, if there is to be a mum in the delivery room, stepmum is it.", "NTA. She broke her own heart, and yours. She was sick, yes, that's sad. But she gave you an addiction. She bloody gave you drugs. That's enough, keep her away OP, when she is sick she behaves so badly that she's dangerous. Lay it down. Mum, you gave me drugs, got me addicted to them. I cannot and will not forget or forgive that, and that is YOUR fault. \n\nThe money was nice, but she's trying to buy forgiveness, and her anger and guilt tripping shows she hasn't truly changed.", "Your mom took pain pills because she had cancer, which can be extremely painful. You didn\u2019t become a drug addict because she gave you one pill after your miscarriage. \n\nYour dad and your stepmom failed you if you became pregnant at 15. They should have discussed birth control with you if you were going to be sexually active at that age. Kinda young but not unheard of. Maybe you were sexually active because you needed love you weren\u2019t getting from family. \n\nSounds like you and your mom could use some therapy together to work things out. Cancer wasn\u2019t her fault but it obviously impacted you greatly. What did your stepmom and dad do to help you deal with that?", "It's a bit of an AH move to ask/accept your Mum's money for down payments on your home, then exclude her completely from your pregnancy and tell her your Stepmum was a more a Mum to you.

Sure, there are a few situations where a parent would be wise to call it a loan - teaching financial responsibility, for instance - but in my estimation this isn't one of them. \n\nTo think Mom is entitled to familial credit for \"lending\" OP money is laughable.

She may not have caused her addiction, but she did nothing to try and be there for her daughter when she could. Also, it reads like to her mum got addicted to her pain medicine after her cancer because she said she was on. Drugs.  As for her stepmum and dad failing her cause she got pregnant WTF?! You are aware that even the best supported kids can F up like this? You\u2019re very judgemental and the parents who were there. Being sick doesn\u2019t give you the right to be an arsehole and if you can\u2019t be there when you\u2019re sick you should bloody well step up when you are well enough.", "It clearly says her mom fed her addiction.

For example, mums in the final stages of cancer who delay medication that makes them sleepy so they can do that.

Enjoy being a mama!", "She started her daughter on pills, that's a choice and has nothing to do with cancer", "This is such a dark take on motherhood holy shit. Actually dragging women for getting health care rather than dying because their life saving medication might temporarily take them off mom-duty. \n\nThis actually makes me sick to my stomach. I\u2019d never expect my mother not to get chemo or not take anti depressants so she could give me more attention while she\u2019s actively dying or trying to fight a live-ending illness. For fucks sake."]}
