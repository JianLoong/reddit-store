And it sucks that he doesn\u2019t also have a free daycare option but that\u2019s not your fault.  He can\u2019t expect you to negatively impact your daily life so that his is not impacted. You offered to have her go to the free daycare everyday, it would be his responsibility to get her there on his days.", "NTA - you\u2019re letting him use your work\u2019s daycare it as long as he drops your daughter off. That\u2019s completely reasonable. \n\nIf he can\u2019t accommodate that he needs to sort out daycare on the days he has her. You drive her and sacrifice time at work so either he can too or he can pay for the ease of a closer daycare.", "[deleted]", "NTA. You're being more than fair. I would withdraw the offer because of his rudeness!", "NTA. The least he can do is drop her off when he\u2019s expecting free daycare.", "So 50% of the time she stays in \u201cyour\u201d daycare at your place of work, and 50% of the time she stays at her old day care which your ex now pays for?\nIf this is the case, your ex now pays about the same as before, right? Because she used to go to her old daycare 100% of the time and now she only goes there 50% of the time.\n\nRegardless, NTA. I think the choice you\u2019ve given him is very reasonable.", "NTA, but you can offer one other solution: He pays you for your time (and fuel). You can set a fair rate - I'd suggest roughly 1.5x your normal pay rate, since it requires you to stay late.", "Wow, both of you sound very petty. I feel bad for your daughter.", "NTA in the sense of you're not doing anything illegal\n\nKinda YTA in the sense that you've now doubled his childcare costs - are you saying you have to pay the old childcare place regardless of whether your child is there or not? So there's no savings to the two of you by your onsite childcare?\n\nIf the idea is: *\"Childcare costs us $1,000 a month, I'll pay $500 and you pay $500*\", but now it's \"*Childcare only costs YOU $1,000 a month, it's all on you*\"... that's changing the rules of the game.\n\nIf you leave this job and get another that DOESN'T have childcare, then you'd go back to paying - you've decided on your own that it's basically WHERE you work that decides IF you pay.\n\nJust looking at it from 30,000 feet, I'd say that where a parent chooses to work shouldn't influence the other parent's costs. Both of you have budgets... you've now just doubled one of his costs through no fault of his own, and he can't take an extra hour off work.\n\nWhy would you want to have a bad co-parenting relationship?", "[deleted]", "Yeah, no. NTA", "Sorry to say but I think YTA but so is your EX. You changed things up on him without talking to him or considering his financial situation. As you've said your old daycare doesn't allow for him to pay just for the days she goes there. He has to pay for even the days she's not there that you originally paid for. So now he's paying twice as much for no reason. He's one too for not working something out with you. You both need to sit down and work out a plan that is financially beneficial for both of you.", "NTA at all. Give and take and all he is doing is taking.", "NTA, but consider taking your daughter to your daycare anyway. For her sake. Consistency in a daycare can be a net positive. Maybe just have your ex compensate you for gas and time, wear and tear on your vehicle, etc.", "If you previously agreed to split childcare costs, then YTA. Any saving you are making is entirely at his expense. He is essentially paying for your new workplace benefit completely out of his own pocket.\n\nPersonally, as someone who has split time with my kid, I'd do what was reasonable. Were I to have a change in situation that would throw my daughter's mum under the bus financially, for the sake of actually working towards being a cohesive and nice family for my daughter, I'd take some mitigating action. In this case you can mitigate entirely by making something you already do on a weekly basis, something you do a few more times a week. It might be fair for you to ask for the fuel cost from the dad (and maybe another small concession).\n\nI'd probably agree to work later for the sake of allowing you *both* to save a significant sum on childcare that is absolutely no longer required. Anything else is either malice or lethargy on your part. Remember that any savings you *or* he makes can directly benefit your daughter going forward. Better QoL, more savings for her future, holidays, activities etc..", "Your poor daughter in all of this\u2026 I think as parents you should decide what is best for HER!", "Wouldn't the daycare cost also halve if you're not keeping the kid for all the days? If its $1000k for 20 days a month, but now you've only got the child in daycare for 10 days, so shouldn't the cost also go down?", "NTA - you didn\u2019t refuse to let him use the free day care, you only refuse to take part on his part of the responsibility. If he wants to save money too then he should drop your daughter off instead of trying to both take advantage of the free daycare and making you stay that extra 40 mins. He\u2019s the AH for expecting everything to be handed to him.", "NTA. He needs to find an alternative that accepts kids part time.", "NTA \n\nIf he wants to enjoy the privilege of utilising your work daycare on his custody days, then he needs to figure out how to get her there. It\u2019s extremely unreasonable of him to try to demand that you rearrange your work days to save him money.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable for him to miss work to pick her up at school and drive her to the daycare. It's nothing *you* don't do on *your* days. It's only a bit longer for him than you. \n\nIf he simply *can't* leave work for that long, then he's stuck with the school daycare. Does it still cost the same even though she's no longer there every day?", "My first question is: What's best for your child? Is it to be in two different day care centers or to be in one?\n\nThen my next question was: Is there a way that you and your ex could make this work? For example, could he pay you what he used to pay in day care at your child's school. Could he do something else that makes up for your 40 minutes of extra time at work? Are there errands during you time with her that he could relieve you of? While not perfect, compromise and some sort of compensation for your time would seem called for.\n\nFinally, even if there is no amicable solution that the two of you can arrive at you're still NTA. He's responsible for her during his 50% That's what the custody implies. Anything that departs from that responsibility should be based on discussion and compromise.", "NTA if the after school care would save me from working an extra hour and it is more convenient for everyone I\u2019d go back to old arrangement and split the cost again for that program. The \u201cfree\u201d care isn\u2019t really free since time and gas seem to be an issue for both of you.", "NTA, dude can't even bother to drive her , he can pay if he doesn't want the inconvenience.", "INFO. Was the cost exorbitant for you previously?  If location wise and stability wise (two daycares in the same week and travel time for her too) can\u2019t you just keep it the way it was?  Because it sounds even a little inconvenient for you on your normal custody days.  You tell us the idea of doing it for him is unfathomable, yet it\u2019s a breeze on your days?\n\nYou also make no mention of him offering you some subsidy on what you\u2019re both saving if switched to your place.  Like maybe 100 a week to you for gas, time etc.  are you saying he made no such offer? \n\nAlso if my employer offered me a free meal every night at one restaurant after work but I had travel 40 minutes to get there with my 6 year old along, I doubt I\u2019d do it every day.  Just because they offer it, doesn\u2019t mean you have to use it.", "Nta. You are responsible for getting her to daycare on her days with you - but he is responsible for it on his days. It is ridiculous for him to ask you to have to stay at work longer so he doesn't have to pay for daycare. You aren't refusing to allow him to use the benefit - you are refusing to work later.", "I am not, all I want him to do is to drive her to me, how is that using her as a pawn?", "Yeah they don't have a rate for half days, you either pay the monthly amount or you don't get to use the daycare.", "I think the ex is now paying twice the price as you have to pay for the space on the days you don't use it if it's alternative weeks\n\nCould you look at switching how you split the 50/5 so you each have set midweek days for childcare - so he's only paying for 3 days a week and using 2.5 a fortnight than pay for 10 and use 5", "OP isn\u2019t being petty at all. She has a daycare available through her job. But in order to utilize it for herself, it comes with a substantial inconvenience. Ex wants to take advantage of that benefit, but wants OP to solely bear the inconvenience.", "And that's why I am all for him using my daycare, but it will be *unfair to me* if I have to sacrifice my evening everyday so he doesn't too.", "This is a program in school, you pay a monthly fee to have a spot reserved. It's not a by the week/day/hour thing. I also don't know how other daycares work, since this was the only one we ever used.", "I did not change things on hik without discussion, I told him that I was changing jobs, I told him that I will be moving houses to be closer to my new job, and I told him that I will no longer be using our old daycare.\n\nHe didn't raise any objections (he pays more, but he certainly can afford it, more than I could afford half of it)", "I agree with this. I have 50/50 custody as well and mine states each will pay half of daycare costs - not just on your days - because it's a need, not a want. We also have to agree on daycare/school/medical decisions. If I pulled this my ex could say \"I don't want her there at all\" and I'd have to take her out. I assume he could do the same but either doesn't realize or is trying to not make it worse.  I'd never make a decision about who is in charge of our child's well-being without a conversation though. If one of us benefits, we both do. We figure out who's insurance is better and when I save money on prescriptions or school supplies because I bargain shop, we both benefit. Some daycares make you pay every day because otherwise people who call in sick or take a lot of vacations wouldn't have their kids there and would expect to pay less. They need proper staffing levels and have to pay the whether your kid is there ir not. However, if it's half the time and a set schedule (for staffing), there's usually a part time rate. They could speak to the director and if they won't budge, put her in a different daycare. She's 6 so it's really before and after school care at this point. Maybe one of her friend's parents would be willing to take her those times possibly even for less money. So many potential solutions and not one of them includes screwing your ex over.", "It's not a matter od money (gas or otherwise), I just have a set routine for my evenings, and staying untill 6PM kind of ruins it.\n\nAlso my daughter seems to like having to daycares, since most of what she does is art or playing around, to her it seems like to going to a different 0layground every other week.", "Op is offering her ex to have the free care. She is just holding him to the fact that he is responsible for their child on his days. It takes her 40 min, it takes him 1 hour. Why is her time less valuable?", "I am not throwing him under the bus, he can benefit from free childcare if he would just drive her to my workplace. He refuses to do so. He is an adult and is free to make whatever decision benefits him, what he is not free to do is to take advantage of me. And my time is no less valuable than his.", "Nah daycare is a horrendous racket. They charge for days they're closed, often you can't reduce days in a given period and in this case it seems the daycare is either \"you pay for fulltime care or none at all\"", "Most daycare\u2019s require you to pay for the entire week, not just the days you\u2019re using. Otherwise they, the daycare center, have holes in their schedule that they can\u2019t fill and lose money and staffing because they can\u2019t afford to pay the staff", "Yes, it costs the same.", "My daughter seems to like having 2 daycares, I don't want the money, I just like having my evenings to me (that 40 minutes usually turns to a whole hour, I get home late, my evening is out of routine...).\n\nAnd I thought his using my daycare for free was a good enough compromise, the same as me doing all childcare for more than 2 years because I was able to WFH and him being a weekend dad.", "Not every job has the flexibility to allow an employee to leave for an hour in the middle of the day.", "When I took this job, I took an $8k downgrade. It evens out with the benefits and all, but I will not be spending money I don't need to just because he refuses to drive oit kid to a free daycare", "Dont listen to all the bitter people making your the bad parent. Youre not. NTA, but theres alot of AH on here that are judging you.", "In that case I feel like it should have been a discussion before you switched things up. This saves you money but totally screws him over and jeopardizes your coparenting dynamic, which has the potential to negatively impact your daughter. You should've at least given him a heads up so he had time to look for alternatives", "Yes children are an inconvenience. It's called parenting. You do what is best for your child. Consistency is important.", "But he can't (or he said he can't). Are you saying he is lying?\n\nBecause from what I see - you've given him the choice of risking his job (being an hour late every day he has your child), or paying double for child care, all because YOU chose to change jobs.\n\nI'm struggling to see how that is his problem, though you've made it his.\n\n**What would you have done if the situation was reversed, and your husband was the one who changed jobs and told you that YOU had to now shoulder 100% of childcare costs?**", "He has said, and the rule of thumb here is that we can only go off what the opposing party has said as being true just, that his workplace wont allow him that hour during the day, whereas hers clearly does allow a gap in the workday.\n\nOP disputes this claiming she knows her ex's workplace policies but that seems unlikely.\n\nEither way, OP gets a new job and either the father has to pay double the childcare costs completely imposed by OP, or make a very disruptive change to his workday. This is all due to OP", "As long as you daughter's fine, then it's his problem to solve.", "True, but when you make an entire human being with someone and then don\u2019t stay romantically involved with them, it is NOT their responsibility to rearrange their own schedule in order to solve that problem FOR you.\n\nEdit: ooh! And we learn from a comment by OP (whom I see no reason not to believe) that their ex DOES have the flexibility at his job, he\u2019s just not willing to be inconvenienced\u2026", "Exactly so the father should meet her halfway and use the daycare. She is already saving him money by agreeing.", "Yes, they are. Someone should tell OP\u2019s ex. Because it appears OP recognizes that.", "He can, I know he can, he just doesn't want to. I know where he works, I know the policies.\n\nAnd if that happened, I either would have done the easiest thing (which is drive her to his work), or keep paying 100%.\n\nWhen I was WFH and he wasn't, and daycares were closed I shouldered childcare on my own 100%, did not ask him to pay since I had her 90% of the time, did not ask him to change his job so it is easier for me, and certainly did not call him an AH for leaving me with 100% of the responsibility and almost 100% of expenses.", "I agree with that. Childcare is the responsibility of the parent who has custody at the time. It's the \"can't be bothered\" part of the comment I was disagreeing with. That suggests the dad is a bad parent and there is no evidence of that.", "You can't control what other people do. She needs to do what is best for her daughter.", "You know who else is going to notice that both her parents see her as an inconvenience? Yep, their poor daughter. They both sound petty.", "OK, then if he can, but chooses not to - NTA\n\nCongrats on finding a company with childcare - that is an amazing perk.", "You've been beyond reasonable. NTA", "There is , look what he is asking and what his reaction to the answer...", "And why he can't? Someone cut his arms?", "Lol!! First you say children are inconvenient. Now you are saying acknowledging that somehow makes one a bad parent?", "I don't see anything that says he is a bad father. He is asking OP to do something that would save him money and she is, rightfully, refusing. He's upset. That doesn't make him a bad father.\n\nEdit: I later found out that OP had stayed in another comment that the dad has the flexibility to pick up his daughter and simply didn't want to. That changes things. That absolutely makes him TA for wanting to dump his responsibilities on OP.", "You clearly don't have children.", "I have 4. I will let you be. You clearly aren\u2019t thinking straight and want to die on the hill that they are both petty despite the illogic in your thinking. Have a good one.", "NTA  \n\n\nI see from the comments that he is able to do the drive at his work, but chooses not to and you took 90% of the childcare during the pandemic with no additional help from him. \n\nSo he can pay more for daycare or he can drive her to yours. \\[If he wasn't able to drive her to yours, it would be a bit more iffy)", "So let me see if I\u2019ve got this straight:\n\nYou had a daycare situation that worked for both of you. Neither one of you needed to drive your child anywhere after school, either one of you could pick your child up when you were done with work (depending on whose day it was for custody), and you split the cost.\n\nThen, you got a better job that came with free daycare. You stopped using the school daycare and started using the free to you one at work. This s a nice benefit to you because 1) you\u2019re not paying for daycare anymore and 2) you can pick up your child from daycare and go straight home - no need to drive to the school to get them. The trade off is that you have to take time out of work to get them from school to work, and that means you have to stay a little later on those days.\n\nWhat you didn\u2019t mention, but is pretty obvious that you skipped over - is that with this arrangement now your ex- is on the hook for paying all of the day care costs instead of half. You doubled the cost to him.\n\nHe asked if your child could just use the free daycare at your work, and you graciously said yes, but stipulated that on his custody days he would be responsible for transportation.\n\n\u2014\n\nSo - at the end of the day you did wind up shifting some of the cost of daycare to you ex. That\u2019s kind of unfair, but life isn\u2019t always fair. In a perfect world he could only pay for daycare at the school for the days he uses, but that\u2019s not how they\u2019re set up. \n\nAnd now he has the option to get free daycare if he\u2019s willing to put in some extra time driving. That\u2019s very reasonable of you, and that seems like an equitable way to remove the impact of his having to pick up your share of the school daycare cost.\n\nBut instead he wants you to be the daycare shuttle driver on his custody days? Oh hell no.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NAH sound like your ex is in a bind and you rightfully don't have to do that. Would your ex pay for private transportation to your work on his days?", "YTA. I say this coming from presumptions made from experience. You made the decision to use a different childcare on your days and no longer split the cost, not a joint decision. Most programs don\u2019t allow you to only pay for days used so he is now paying for childcare during his time with her and yours.  Should you have to sacrifice the time everyday, no, should you have made a unilateral decision that doubles his expenses and takes away stability and structure from a six year old, no. You should go back to splitting costs and leaving her where she is.", "Nope NTA. if he can't make arrangements and wants you to bend over backwards to make HIS life more convenient, he's SOL. I don't get how ppl want favors but aren't willing to help you, help them.", "NTA\n\nBut did you two consider that you can pay someone to pick your daughter up from school and drive her to your free daycare.\nThen you could split the cost and you don't have to stay 40 minutes later every time.", "NTA\n\nMaking arrangements for childcare during __his__ time is __his__ responsibility.", "I was leaning towards you being the AH until I read that reasoning. You\u2019re NTA here. He should try to figure out a compromise and not put this all on you.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.. his responsibility to find child care on his custodial days.", "NTA. Your time isn't valuable to him - or at least, less valuable than his own.", "NTA - you aren't refusing to have her at the daycare. You're just telling him he's responsible for getting your kid there, which is exactly as it should be.", "NTA. He can drive her or pay.", "NTA.  Hell no!  If he wants to take advantage of your benefit then he has to work it out.  No way would I have to work 40 minutes extra every day just to make his life easier.", "NTA. He is being a bit self important to expect you to do the driving, and work OT because of it, while saving him money. I\u2019m guessing his sense of entitlement is part of the reason why he\u2019s your ex.", "NTA bc you tried to compromise", "NTA", "YTA \n\nSeems like a power play. It\u2019s free! And it\u2019s only 40 minutes.  You will one day need him to cut you some slack and don\u2019t be surprised when he says no.", "If you agreed to cover half the cost of the daycare expenses, seems to me you are still on the hook for those costs.", "What time would you get home if you left the daughter in the after school care and picked her up after you finished work? The daycare with your work may be 'free' but it's still costing you in fuel, the effort of driving to get her and settling her at your work, and the 5.40 finishes.", "INFO: Why can't he pay someone to drop her off and pick her up from the daycare? It would be a win win solution that allows him to reduce costs and not leave work while not inconveniencing you? I mean, paying someone to drive the kid to and from daycare would likely be cheaper than paying for a full day of daycare?", "I don\u2019t get it very would you drive to the school to get her and back to work? And then stay after work to make up the time? It seems like a lot more work snd gas money. Also what about the people watching your daughter? Do they have to stay late while you make up your hours?", "Is he actually able to leave work? If not yes yta. You\u2019re not having to pay anything but expect him to either miss work or keep paying. You don\u2019t have any penalty, any fees, and are concerned about a 40 minute time window. Not to mention the stability of having ONE daycare is better for her. She\u2019s your daughter 100% of the time not just when she\u2019s in your house. Coparenting is meant to be peaceful and beneficial to everyone. You aren\u2019t coparenting. You\u2019re saying his time his problem as If she stops being your responsibility too the moment he picks her up. Do you expect him to say yes anytime you ask him for anything regarding her? If so that\u2019s hypocritical af", "Wouldn't he still only be paying half the bill anyway, because daughter is there every other week, not every week? So he's still only paying for 2 weeks a month, like before?? Or am I missing something?", "NTA - but consistency for kids is very important.", "NTA. I was ready to say the opposite given \"free daycare,\" but the question is really whether you should have to spend 40 minutes dropping her off on your ex's days with her. You should not. He can drop her off or make other arrangements.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed if he made a concession to make it happen.

He could offer $30/day to someone to drive the daughter and still only be paying $300/month which is a huge savings and even less than he was likely paying before. $20 for an hour of driving after paying for gas is a fantastic pay rate for someone who has to care for their own kids while trying to make money.

This is the sort of thing you have to think about when you've got split custody.

It might fundamentally be unworkable, or they might just be petty employers, or he might be lying.\n\nPoint is that she *knows* she can split her workday to collect her child. She has already reaped a benefit in that she has stopped paying any childcare at all. At the moment the father is paying for the previously agreed full time hours for half the amount of childcare. It would be very strange for him to not try to completely cut that not-insubstantial cost out by driving an hour every other day if he were able.\n\nTherefore all that has happened is that OP has reneged on a childcare cost arrangement to the detriment of the father.", "Ok lets go with your logic:\n\nOP states: \"He said that he can't get off work to drive her to me\".

Everybody I know would do that if it were at all possible. Everybody. But he has said it isn't possible with work, so all that has happened from the fathers perspective is that OP got a new job and reneged on an established deal to split the monthly fee of the childcare provider because she no longer benefits; and therefore because they chose a lace (presumably together) that doesn't allow part time care, they OP has saddled him with double the childcare costs because - as OP states - he **can not get time off work** in the middle of the day to drive an hour to OPs new workplace and back. \n\nOP has proven she can work around a 40 minute daily absence, and she is already benefiting through not paying any childcare (which we've shown the father has had to entirely pick up the cost of). It is reasonable for her to either honour the cost of the pre-existing childcare agreement until father can find somewhere that takes their daughter part time, or act to minimise the financial impact she has imposed on the father.", "You need to read more carefully.

I wouldn't pay someone unless it was family to do that.\n\nReally in my view the OP made a change that benefitted her immediately, to the immediate significant cost of the father. If he can make the new scenario work it is good for both of them, I completely agree, but if his workplace doesn't allow for him to benefit from this change, OP is benefiting to the direct loss of the father. As someone who coparents I believe that it is always the correct thing to try to minimise any impact to the other parent where my decision would affect them.\n\nOP has gained through a quite large cut in monthly costs which at present has been directly transferred as a cost to the father. It would be nice, and foster better relations between them as a family, if she would make a small concession (its 20 minutes each way a couple of times a week extra) that can be paid for by the father, rather than having her decision leave him paying - in the OPs words - \" not a small amount\" in childcare. \n\nOf course if the father just can't be arsed, then you're absolutely right, but I don't imagine anyone would refuse to drive an hour a few times a week so they could save paying fulltime childcare, which is probably more than their rent/mortgage.", "lol, why post at all if you're unwilling to read a fairly short reply?\n\nThe father said he can't get the time off work, and therefore his costs have doubled.

As OPs work have allowed her the 40 minutes required to be flexibly worked, the father should pay her travel costs for the days that are 'his' as well as either extra costs for the later workday for OP, or agree a favour/childcare arrangement change to suit the OP to compensate.\n\nAt present its a case that OP gets free childcare and the father is on the hook for double the amount he previously was.

OP took a pay cut for a job with better benefits and flexibility. OP makes less than her ex. The ex, per this comment, has the flexibility to transport the child. \n\nThe benefit of in-school child care was almost originally all on the ex. Now the benefit is more so on OP\u2019s side. It would be nice is everyone wanted to help everyone out but that is not the way of the world. \n\nYou say in your new comment that the ex should oh travel costs.
