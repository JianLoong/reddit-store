And it sucks that he doesn\u2019t also have a free daycare option but that\u2019s not your fault.  He can\u2019t expect you to negatively impact your daily life so that his is not impacted. You offered to have her go to the free daycare everyday, it would be his responsibility to get her there on his days.", "NTA - you\u2019re letting him use your work\u2019s daycare it as long as he drops your daughter off. That\u2019s completely reasonable. \n\nIf he can\u2019t accommodate that he needs to sort out daycare on the days he has her. You drive her and sacrifice time at work so either he can too or he can pay for the ease of a closer daycare.", "[deleted]", "NTA. You're being more than fair. I would withdraw the offer because of his rudeness!", "NTA. The least he can do is drop her off when he\u2019s expecting free daycare.", "So 50% of the time she stays in \u201cyour\u201d daycare at your place of work, and 50% of the time she stays at her old day care which your ex now pays for?\nIf this is the case, your ex now pays about the same as before, right? Because she used to go to her old daycare 100% of the time and now she only goes there 50% of the time.\n\nRegardless, NTA. I think the choice you\u2019ve given him is very reasonable.", "NTA, but you can offer one other solution: He pays you for your time (and fuel). You can set a fair rate - I'd suggest roughly 1.5x your normal pay rate, since it requires you to stay late.", "Wow, both of you sound very petty. I feel bad for your daughter.", "NTA in the sense of you're not doing anything illegal\n\nKinda YTA in the sense that you've now doubled his childcare costs - are you saying you have to pay the old childcare place regardless of whether your child is there or not? So there's no savings to the two of you by your onsite childcare?\n\nIf the idea is: *\"Childcare costs us $1,000 a month, I'll pay $500 and you pay $500*\", but now it's \"*Childcare only costs YOU $1,000 a month, it's all on you*\"... that's changing the rules of the game.\n\nIf you leave this job and get another that DOESN'T have childcare, then you'd go back to paying - you've decided on your own that it's basically WHERE you work that decides IF you pay.\n\nJust looking at it from 30,000 feet, I'd say that where a parent chooses to work shouldn't influence the other parent's costs. Both of you have budgets... you've now just doubled one of his costs through no fault of his own, and he can't take an extra hour off work.\n\nWhy would you want to have a bad co-parenting relationship?", "[deleted]", "Yeah, no. NTA", "Sorry to say but I think YTA but so is your EX. You changed things up on him without talking to him or considering his financial situation. As you've said your old daycare doesn't allow for him to pay just for the days she goes there. He has to pay for even the days she's not there that you originally paid for. So now he's paying twice as much for no reason. He's one too for not working something out with you. You both need to sit down and work out a plan that is financially beneficial for both of you.", "NTA at all. Give and take and all he is doing is taking.", "NTA, but consider taking your daughter to your daycare anyway. For her sake. Consistency in a daycare can be a net positive. Maybe just have your ex compensate you for gas and time, wear and tear on your vehicle, etc.", "If you previously agreed to split childcare costs, then YTA. Any saving you are making is entirely at his expense. He is essentially paying for your new workplace benefit completely out of his own pocket.\n\nPersonally, as someone who has split time with my kid, I'd do what was reasonable. Were I to have a change in situation that would throw my daughter's mum under the bus financially, for the sake of actually working towards being a cohesive and nice family for my daughter, I'd take some mitigating action. In this case you can mitigate entirely by making something you already do on a weekly basis, something you do a few more times a week. It might be fair for you to ask for the fuel cost from the dad (and maybe another small concession).\n\nI'd probably agree to work later for the sake of allowing you *both* to save a significant sum on childcare that is absolutely no longer required. Anything else is either malice or lethargy on your part. Remember that any savings you *or* he makes can directly benefit your daughter going forward. Better QoL, more savings for her future, holidays, activities etc..", "Your poor daughter in all of this\u2026 I think as parents you should decide what is best for HER!", "Wouldn't the daycare cost also halve if you're not keeping the kid for all the days? If its $1000k for 20 days a month, but now you've only got the child in daycare for 10 days, so shouldn't the cost also go down?", "NTA - you didn\u2019t refuse to let him use the free day care, you only refuse to take part on his part of the responsibility. If he wants to save money too then he should drop your daughter off instead of trying to both take advantage of the free daycare and making you stay that extra 40 mins. He\u2019s the AH for expecting everything to be handed to him.", "NTA. He needs to find an alternative that accepts kids part time.", "NTA \n\nIf he wants to enjoy the privilege of utilising your work daycare on his custody days, then he needs to figure out how to get her there. It\u2019s extremely unreasonable of him to try to demand that you rearrange your work days to save him money.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable for him to miss work to pick her up at school and drive her to the daycare. It's nothing *you* don't do on *your* days. It's only a bit longer for him than you. \n\nIf he simply *can't* leave work for that long, then he's stuck with the school daycare. Does it still cost the same even though she's no longer there every day?", "My first question is: What's best for your child? Is it to be in two different day care centers or to be in one?\n\nThen my next question was: Is there a way that you and your ex could make this work? For example, could he pay you what he used to pay in day care at your child's school. Could he do something else that makes up for your 40 minutes of extra time at work? Are there errands during you time with her that he could relieve you of? While not perfect, compromise and some sort of compensation for your time would seem called for.\n\nFinally, even if there is no amicable solution that the two of you can arrive at you're still NTA. He's responsible for her during his 50% That's what the custody implies. Anything that departs from that responsibility should be based on discussion and compromise.", "NTA if the after school care would save me from working an extra hour and it is more convenient for everyone I\u2019d go back to old arrangement and split the cost again for that program. The \u201cfree\u201d care isn\u2019t really free since time and gas seem to be an issue for both of you. Edit on his days he\u2019s responsible for after school care just as you are on your days. If he wants to use the free he\u2019s responsible to get her there and home on his days.", "NTA, dude can't even bother to drive her , he can pay if he doesn't want the inconvenience.", "INFO. Was the cost exorbitant for you previously?  If location wise and stability wise (two daycares in the same week and travel time for her too) can\u2019t you just keep it the way it was?  Because it sounds even a little inconvenient for you on your normal custody days.  You tell us the idea of doing it for him is unfathomable, yet it\u2019s a breeze on your days?\n\nYou also make no mention of him offering you some subsidy on what you\u2019re both saving if switched to your place.  Like maybe 100 a week to you for gas, time etc.  are you saying he made no such offer? \n\nAlso if my employer offered me a free meal every night at one restaurant after work but I had travel 40 minutes to get there with my 6 year old along, I doubt I\u2019d do it every day.  Just because they offer it, doesn\u2019t mean you have to use it.", "Nta. You are responsible for getting her to daycare on her days with you - but he is responsible for it on his days. It is ridiculous for him to ask you to have to stay at work longer so he doesn't have to pay for daycare. You aren't refusing to allow him to use the benefit - you are refusing to work later.", "I am not, all I want him to do is to drive her to me, how is that using her as a pawn?", "Yeah they don't have a rate for half days, you either pay the monthly amount or you don't get to use the daycare.", "I think the ex is now paying twice the price as you have to pay for the space on the days you don't use it if it's alternative weeks\n\nCould you look at switching how you split the 50/5 so you each have set midweek days for childcare - so he's only paying for 3 days a week and using 2.5 a fortnight than pay for 10 and use 5", "OP isn\u2019t being petty at all. She has a daycare available through her job. But in order to utilize it for herself, it comes with a substantial inconvenience. Ex wants to take advantage of that benefit, but wants OP to solely bear the inconvenience.", "And that's why I am all for him using my daycare, but it will be *unfair to me* if I have to sacrifice my evening everyday so he doesn't too.", "This is a program in school, you pay a monthly fee to have a spot reserved. It's not a by the week/day/hour thing. I also don't know how other daycares work, since this was the only one we ever used.", "I did not change things on hik without discussion, I told him that I was changing jobs, I told him that I will be moving houses to be closer to my new job, and I told him that I will no longer be using our old daycare.\n\nHe didn't raise any objections (he pays more, but he certainly can afford it, more than I could afford half of it)", "I agree with this. I have 50/50 custody as well and mine states each will pay half of daycare costs - not just on your days - because it's a need, not a want. We also have to agree on daycare/school/medical decisions. If I pulled this my ex could say \"I don't want her there at all\" and I'd have to take her out. I assume he could do the same but either doesn't realize or is trying to not make it worse.  I'd never make a decision about who is in charge of our child's well-being without a conversation though. If one of us benefits, we both do. We figure out who's insurance is better and when I save money on prescriptions or school supplies because I bargain shop, we both benefit. Some daycares make you pay every day because otherwise people who call in sick or take a lot of vacations wouldn't have their kids there and would expect to pay less. They need proper staffing levels and have to pay the whether your kid is there ir not. However, if it's half the time and a set schedule (for staffing), there's usually a part time rate. They could speak to the director and if they won't budge, put her in a different daycare. She's 6 so it's really before and after school care at this point. Maybe one of her friend's parents would be willing to take her those times possibly even for less money. So many potential solutions and not one of them includes screwing your ex over.", "It's not a matter od money (gas or otherwise), I just have a set routine for my evenings, and staying untill 6PM kind of ruins it.\n\nAlso my daughter seems to like having to daycares, since most of what she does is art or playing around, to her it seems like to going to a different 0layground every other week.", "Op is offering her ex to have the free care. She is just holding him to the fact that he is responsible for their child on his days. It takes her 40 min, it takes him 1 hour. Why is her time less valuable?", "I am not throwing him under the bus, he can benefit from free childcare if he would just drive her to my workplace. He refuses to do so. He is an adult and is free to make whatever decision benefits him, what he is not free to do is to take advantage of me. And my time is no less valuable than his.", "Nah daycare is a horrendous racket. They charge for days they're closed, often you can't reduce days in a given period and in this case it seems the daycare is either \"you pay for fulltime care or none at all\"", "Most daycare\u2019s require you to pay for the entire week, not just the days you\u2019re using. Otherwise they, the daycare center, have holes in their schedule that they can\u2019t fill and lose money and staffing because they can\u2019t afford to pay the staff", "Yes, it costs the same.", "My daughter seems to like having 2 daycares, I don't want the money, I just like having my evenings to me (that 40 minutes usually turns to a whole hour, I get home late, my evening is out of routine...).\n\nAnd I thought his using my daycare for free was a good enough compromise, the same as me doing all childcare for more than 2 years because I was able to WFH and him being a weekend dad.", "Not every job has the flexibility to allow an employee to leave for an hour in the middle of the day.", "When I took this job, I took an $8k downgrade. It evens out with the benefits and all, but I will not be spending money I don't need to just because he refuses to drive oit kid to a free daycare", "Dont listen to all the bitter people making your the bad parent. Youre not. NTA, but theres alot of AH on here that are judging you.", "In that case I feel like it should have been a discussion before you switched things up. This saves you money but totally screws him over and jeopardizes your coparenting dynamic, which has the potential to negatively impact your daughter. You should've at least given him a heads up so he had time to look for alternatives", "Yes children are an inconvenience. It's called parenting. You do what is best for your child. Consistency is important.", "But he can't (or he said he can't). Are you saying he is lying?\n\nBecause from what I see - you've given him the choice of risking his job (being an hour late every day he has your child), or paying double for child care, all because YOU chose to change jobs.\n\nI'm struggling to see how that is his problem, though you've made it his.\n\n**What would you have done if the situation was reversed, and your husband was the one who changed jobs and told you that YOU had to now shoulder 100% of childcare costs?**", "He has said, and the rule of thumb here is that we can only go off what the opposing party has said as being true just, that his workplace wont allow him that hour during the day, whereas hers clearly does allow a gap in the workday.\n\nOP disputes this claiming she knows her ex's workplace policies but that seems unlikely.\n\nEither way, OP gets a new job and either the father has to pay double the childcare costs completely imposed by OP, or make a very disruptive change to his workday. This is all due to OP", "As long as you daughter's fine, then it's his problem to solve.", "True, but when you make an entire human being with someone and then don\u2019t stay romantically involved with them, it is NOT their responsibility to rearrange their own schedule in order to solve that problem FOR you.\n\nEdit: ooh! And we learn from a comment by OP (whom I see no reason not to believe) that their ex DOES have the flexibility at his job, he\u2019s just not willing to be inconvenienced\u2026", "Exactly so the father should meet her halfway and use the daycare. She is already saving him money by agreeing.", "Yes, they are. Someone should tell OP\u2019s ex. Because it appears OP recognizes that.", "He can, I know he can, he just doesn't want to. I know where he works, I know the policies.\n\nAnd if that happened, I either would have done the easiest thing (which is drive her to his work), or keep paying 100%.\n\nWhen I was WFH and he wasn't, and daycares were closed I shouldered childcare on my own 100%, did not ask him to pay since I had her 90% of the time, did not ask him to change his job so it is easier for me, and certainly did not call him an AH for leaving me with 100% of the responsibility and almost 100% of expenses.", "I agree with that. Childcare is the responsibility of the parent who has custody at the time. It's the \"can't be bothered\" part of the comment I was disagreeing with. That suggests the dad is a bad parent and there is no evidence of that.", "You can't control what other people do. She needs to do what is best for her daughter.", "You know who else is going to notice that both her parents see her as an inconvenience? Yep, their poor daughter. They both sound petty.", "OK, then if he can, but chooses not to - NTA\n\nCongrats on finding a company with childcare - that is an amazing perk.", "You've been beyond reasonable. NTA", "There is , look what he is asking and what his reaction to the answer...", "And why he can't? Someone cut his arms?", "Lol!! First you say children are inconvenient. Now you are saying acknowledging that somehow makes one a bad parent?", "I don't see anything that says he is a bad father. He is asking OP to do something that would save him money and she is, rightfully, refusing. He's upset. That doesn't make him a bad father.\n\nEdit: I later found out that OP had statex in another comment that the dad has the flexibility to pick up his daughter and simply didn't want to. That changes things. That absolutely makes him TA for wanting to dump his responsibilities on OP.", "You clearly don't have children.", "I have 4. I will let you be. You clearly aren\u2019t thinking straight and want to die on the hill that they are both petty despite the illogic in your thinking. Have a good one.", "NTA  \n\n\nI see from the comments that he is able to do the drive at his work, but chooses not to and you took 90% of the childcare during the pandemic with no additional help from him. \n\nSo he can pay more for daycare or he can drive her to yours. \\[If he wasn't able to drive her to yours, it would be a bit more iffy)", "So let me see if I\u2019ve got this straight:\n\nYou had a daycare situation that worked for both of you. Neither one of you needed to drive your child anywhere after school, either one of you could pick your child up when you were done with work (depending on whose day it was for custody), and you split the cost.\n\nThen, you got a better job that came with free daycare. You stopped using the school daycare and started using the free to you one at work. This s a nice benefit to you because 1) you\u2019re not paying for daycare anymore and 2) you can pick up your child from daycare and go straight home - no need to drive to the school to get them. The trade off is that you have to take time out of work to get them from school to work, and that means you have to stay a little later on those days.\n\nWhat you didn\u2019t mention, but is pretty obvious that you skipped over - is that with this arrangement now your ex- is on the hook for paying all of the day care costs instead of half. You doubled the cost to him.\n\nHe asked if your child could just use the free daycare at your work, and you graciously said yes, but stipulated that on his custody days he would be responsible for transportation.\n\n\u2014\n\nSo - at the end of the day you did wind up shifting some of the cost of daycare to you ex. That\u2019s kind of unfair, but life isn\u2019t always fair. In a perfect world he could only pay for daycare at the school for the days he uses, but that\u2019s not how they\u2019re set up. \n\nAnd now he has the option to get free daycare if he\u2019s willing to put in some extra time driving. That\u2019s very reasonable of you, and that seems like an equitable way to remove the impact of his having to pick up your share of the school daycare cost.\n\nBut instead he wants you to be the daycare shuttle driver on his custody days? Oh hell no.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NAH sound like your ex is in a bind and you rightfully don't have to do that. Would your ex pay for private transportation to your work on his days?", "YTA. I say this coming from presumptions made from experience. You made the decision to use a different childcare on your days and no longer split the cost, not a joint decision. Most programs don\u2019t allow you to only pay for days used so he is now paying for childcare during his time with her and yours.  Should you have to sacrifice the time everyday, no, should you have made a unilateral decision that doubles his expenses and takes away stability and structure from a six year old, no. You should go back to splitting costs and leaving her where she is.", "Nope NTA. if he can't make arrangements and wants you to bend over backwards to make HIS life more convenient, he's SOL. I don't get how ppl want favors but aren't willing to help you, help them.", "NTA\n\nBut did you two consider that you can pay someone to pick your daughter up from school and drive her to your free daycare.\nThen you could split the cost and you don't have to stay 40 minutes later every time.", "NTA\n\nMaking arrangements for childcare during __his__ time is __his__ responsibility.", "I was leaning towards you being the AH until I read that reasoning. You\u2019re NTA here. He should try to figure out a compromise and not put this all on you.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.. his responsibility to find child care on his custodial days.", "NTA. Your time isn't valuable to him - or at least, less valuable than his own.", "NTA - you aren't refusing to have her at the daycare. You're just telling him he's responsible for getting your kid there, which is exactly as it should be.", "NTA. He can drive her or pay.", "NTA.  Hell no!  If he wants to take advantage of your benefit then he has to work it out.  No way would I have to work 40 minutes extra every day just to make his life easier.", "NTA. He is being a bit self important to expect you to do the driving, and work OT because of it, while saving him money. I\u2019m guessing his sense of entitlement is part of the reason why he\u2019s your ex.", "NTA bc you tried to compromise", "NTA", "YTA \n\nSeems like a power play. It\u2019s free!

It would be a win win solution that allows him to reduce costs and not leave work while not inconveniencing you? I mean, paying someone to drive the kid to and from daycare would likely be cheaper than paying for a full day of daycare?", "I don\u2019t get it very would you drive to the school to get her and back to work? And then stay after work to make up the time? It seems like a lot more work snd gas money. Also what about the people watching your daughter? Do they have to stay late while you make up your hours?", "Is he actually able to leave work? If not yes yta. You\u2019re not having to pay anything but expect him to either miss work or keep paying. You don\u2019t have any penalty, any fees, and are concerned about a 40 minute time window. Not to mention the stability of having ONE daycare is better for her. She\u2019s your daughter 100% of the time not just when she\u2019s in your house. Coparenting is meant to be peaceful and beneficial to everyone. You aren\u2019t coparenting. You\u2019re saying his time his problem as If she stops being your responsibility too the moment he picks her up. Do you expect him to say yes anytime you ask him for anything regarding her? If so that\u2019s hypocritical af", "Wouldn't he still only be paying half the bill anyway, because daughter is there every other week, not every week? So he's still only paying for 2 weeks a month, like before?? Or am I missing something?", "NTA - but consistency for kids is very important.", "NTA. I was ready to say the opposite given \"free daycare,\" but the question is really whether you should have to spend 40 minutes dropping her off on your ex's days with her. You should not.

That's unreasonable. She found herself a better option and even extended the offer to ex for his days, which she didn't have to do. He can either find another daycare for his time, make other arrangements for pickup, or deal with it.

I understand know that it is every other week.", "So you say OP should keep paying for daycare although she has the option of free daycare through her job?", "I thought the child went less day's in the week to this daycare.

Any time you do something that is going to cost the other parent extra money there should be  a discussion.", "This is spoken like someone who has never had to rely on childcare.

As a coparent I'd do my best to not dump a big old monthly bill on my daughter's mum, even if that did mean working 40 minutes late.

We pay even if she doesn't go (sick, vacation, etc). The only exception is if we give two weeks written notice and she's out the full M-F. But that's only allowed for just one week per year. We live in an area with mostly professional/white collar two income households, so demand is very high. We also had to get on the waiting list BEFORE getting pregnant to secure a spot at the daycare our first was at and that was pre-covid. I know their current wait list is around 14 months. I do believe in more rural areas it's a bit less crazy.\n\nBasically all that to say, child care in the US is freaking expensive and not flexible.", "I am saying OP should have a conversation with her ex where they look at all the options together and choose how to move forward, which might look like OP temporarily continuing to pay her share of the original childcare agreement until the father has found an alternative.", "That's a bit of a reach.

It was incredibly hard to mind a young child while working from home during the pandemic.

Should he pitch in for the Nintendo Switch that will only be used at my home? Should he pay for any special food items I get for her? \n\nIm going to believe OP when she said she discussed it with him prior, and knows he can make the effort - she should not have to give up any of her time to convenience him. Once in awhile sure, to help out. But every day? She should not have to work late 40 mins everyday to save him money. The more reasonable situation here would be for the baby daddy to look for an alternative childcare that fits within his budget on his days.", "But that leaves him with the other options of getting someone else to pick up daughter or finding another daycare. Large life event changes such as a new job, which likely benefits the child, result in a reevaluation of previous arrangements. Sure they found a daycare together before that worked for both of them without additional stress to either one so it was reasonable to split. Now, circumstances have changed and OP found other arrangements for her time. She is absolutely within her legal and moral rights to do so. Continuing the old arrangement is no longer the easiest option for her so she doesn't have to stick to that service on her time with the child.

So now he is working till 6. He still has to drive 30 minutes to an hour to pick her up, making it 7. Is the daycare open? Is he going to be given a bill for \"after hours coverage\"? Will cops be called because he \"abandoned\" the kid? Is this a sneaky way OP is using to get more custody because dad can't be bothered to pick up daughter on time?) \n\nAdditionally, was enrolling her in 2 daycare discussed?

In aftercare places, you just pick what days the kid is there (every one I\u2019ve ever had, you had to pick a month in advance), and then you only pay for the days you choose.  Dad could most likely just change the schedule to whenever kid is there, and then only pay for those days.", "That just isn't how most daycares work.\n\nAlmost every parent needs full-time coverage, so daycares can't generally accommodate part-time students -- they can't find anyone else to full the remainder of that full-time slot.  Every parent has to pay to keep their kid's full-time slot regardless of how many hours they use the service.  Even if you go on vacation for a week, you still need to pay for the hours you're not there in order to hold your slot or they'll fill the opening from their waiting list and you'll need to find a new daycare.", "That\u2019s not how daycare works. They don\u2019t charge hourly. They charge monthly.", "Why don\u2019t you just call Netflix and tell them you\u2019re only watching half as many hours of TV this week so you\u2019d like your bill cut in half.", "Add to this - why not charge him additional dollars for your time!", "Hmm. I mean, the other way to look at it is that he now also has to pay double the amount for the daycare costs, because you'd rather drive 40 minutes to pick up your daughter in the middle of the day than at 5pm, just to take advantage of your work's free childcare. You're not saving any time doing that, it just suits you better getting to save some money, which pushes a bigger financial burden onto the dad. idk if it's possible for him to look into part-time daycare options as another alternative, but assuming this is the best daycare option available, you've forced his hand by not exactly making a compromise yourself.\n\nI'm not sure how this is much fairer than your old routine - shouldn't the right solution suit both of you equally? You had the choice to save some money with no trade off (all pros), and because of that he's now made to choose between sacrificing money OR sacrificing time + saving some money (con vs. pro/con). He has to make a sacrifice either way. (edit: saying this assuming that the extra cost would be a v significant expense rather than spare pocket change to him. idk what your salaries are)\n\nIt's definitely not fair to ask you to pick your child up for him (given that he'd also be benefitting off your work benefits), but I can see where he's coming from. Practically speaking, unless there are other daycare options available, you kinda *have* just pushed your \"cost savings\" over to him to deal with, and I\u2019m sure from his perspective, he is now seeing this as you \u201crefusing to compromise\u201d for *him*.\n\nI can more than see your point of view too; no one's really an AH here. It's his responsibility to sort out his own stuff on his custody days, but I kinda think you both need to give a little here given that the daycare cost used to be a \"shared\" responsibility (not trying to imply you should pay half if you're not using it). Maybe a solution would be him spending his 50% daycare budget on childcare costs to get someone else to drive your child to your work daycare. I think this is a situation that would benefit more from y'all talking to each other rather than consulting internet strangers lol.

They're both responsible for an equitable amount of the childcare costs. In a situation where it wasn't 50/50, and she had custody, he couldn't not pay support because \"she's responsible for the child's care during her time.\" The cost of a child's care is what is considered. \n\nShe offloaded her half of the childcare costs to him. He didn't get anything in return.

Usually, you have to pay full price for your child regardless of how many hours the kids stay. If you pick your kid up early, you pay the whole day. If you take a week off, you still pay for the week to keep the spot reserved. And if your kid only goes three days a week, you pay for the whole week. That way the daycare gets a consistent income and can always be fully staffed.  So it is likely that the ex is paying for the whole week instead of 50 percent, so his costs for daycare have doubled.\n\nBut if he wants to use the free child care then he can get the kiddo to daycare on his days. His job is flexible and it would save him a ton of money.", "But we're talking about after-school childcare, not school costs. If OP were to work from home like she did during the pandemic, is she supposed to pay for after-school childcare when she doesn't need it and doesn't use it? \n\nAnd maybe the father can consider this payment towards OP for all the childcare she did during the pandemic during his custody time.", "Well, she added it in an edit now.", "Yeah I agree with this, like she\u2019s not in the wrong but it\u2019s still hard for him.

So, she benefits from having more money in her pocket at the expense of the father having less in his pocket.\n\nI'm sure they can work out a situation where they both come out ahead, but the reality is that she benefits from the arrangement and he is harmed by it.", "That or his time commitment just doubled.

While I'm not a parent, I do respect that it's a difficult job, but it's not one that kid could have asked for, so it's the parent's responsibility to take on the non-fun stuff. \n\nWe've all seen horror stories about the costs of childcare.

However you do have some issues with communication, and maybe child support. At least in my state, \"monthly cost of childcare\" is a category on the child support calculator, and each parent inputs an amount. That amount is part of the calculation of it costs X amount per month to raise this child. So you would put $0 and your ex would put whatever he's paying for full-time care. This is a financial burden for him paying this on his own when you used to split it, and it reduces his household's income by that amount and **reduces the funds available to your daughter at that household**. This is why this is likely specifically a child support issue.\n\nYou've had a significant change in the childcare calculations here, and the balance is off. Yes, you don't currently need the childcare because yours is free, but it's also not fair that he's paying for all of it. I think he has a pretty reasonable case to ask you for child support to offset this cost, but anyone can correct me if I'm wrong here. I just know how my state's calculator runs this. When there's a substantial change in the financial tables like this, the right thing to do is re-run the child support calculations and see where you're at. It's burdensome for him to drive all the way out there to drop her off and pick up, and it's also burdensome for him to pay for full time after school care for her. He's really between a rock and a hard place and the one who suffers ultimately is your daughter.

Either way hes just looking to manipulate you into giving something up on your free days.", "To make it work with him driving, he would have to get his daughter when school lets out (waiting in the long school pickup line, because she wouldn't be in aftercare anymore), drive her 20 minutes to ex's work, drive another 20 minutes back to his work. Then drive 20 minutes to ex's work at the end of the day, and home again with daughter. It's 80 minutes of driving in the afternoon, not counting the pickup line wait and any other delays, plus a LOT of being in a car for this poor kid. It just doesn't seem like a reasonable solution when he has to pick between that or paying 2x as much in childcare as he was paying before, when he's not the one who made the change. I agree that asking her to be a driver isn't really fair either. Imo the best solution is that OP is going to have to pay child support for the original aftercare program. Ex has a certain cost of daycare that goes into the cost of raising this child, and him paying all of it is burdensome -- it's literally draining his household and reducing funds available to the daughter. That's why child support exists. OP could avoid paying this cost by helping with transportation, but she doesn't want to do that (which is fair). OP could also just use the aftercare in lieu of the free care and not interrupt their afternoon by leaving to go get daughter.", "Especially the \u201cit\u2019s not your problem.\u201d Like what?

No way!  \n\nHer compromise wasn't wrong.  He can use the free daycare that's HER benefit but he has to make compromises to get her there.  He could talk to his employer and try to work it out, even work later to make the time up on the days he doesn't have his daughter or in the evenings after she goes to bed but  instead calls OP names.", "This post is the evidence of his bad parenting. He is trying to pass off his own transportation responsibilities to the mother instead of putting in the work of dealing with it himself. That doesn't mean he is a \"bad dad\", but it does mean he is guilty of some bad parenting.", "Right.  And setting this example makes him a shite person as well.", "I agree and I thought it was nice of OP to say yes to him using the free childcare. She leaves her job to pick up her daughter and then has to make up that time. Dad has the same options but declined to utilise it. That\u2019s on him not OP."]}
