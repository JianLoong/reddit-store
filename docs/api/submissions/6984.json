With maybe even her paying more than you since she gets more. But if you decided to split evenly, her going against that is wrong.

Should only he have access to the children then? Why is money the weird dividing line in your head, not the other 17,000 things a stay at home spouse does. Should only he get to eat dinner? Wife can just buy her own dinner, she has money. She's not entitled to his labor.\n\nBoth people are working in this relationship. Your flaw is not seeing the stay at home person as working and thus deserving an equal share.", "Man that's what I always think, people act like the house suddenly just gets itself together, just because teenagers exist. As if teenagers aren't messy little assholes that you have to prod constantly to get the minimum amount of work out of them. You can have the best teenagers in the world, and they are still going to have weeks, months of doing fuckall because they are hormonal and angry, and that's fine.\n\nTeenagers still gotta be fed, laundry for all those people must be done, like sure you've got them out of the house to do the cleaning but teenagers are not suddenly house keepers past the age of 10 lmao. Like just keeping them showering daily at 11-14 is a struggle.", "He\u2019s not crying over his money being spent, he\u2019s upset that his wife is not honouring their financial agreement.

Fucking hilarious", "While children can be left alone for 1-3 hours, maybe they don't want to do that? Maybe that's why he's the stay at home parent, because he and the other parent have decided, nah, we don't want our kids alone for hours when we can afford to be there. Just because a parent is home does not mean he's just staring at them constantly. \n\nMoney is not the issue in their relationship, they have money to afford the lifestyle they want. The issue is the wife seeing a pool of 'available' money and thinking, it's just sitting there, I will use it. When it wasn't her money, it was his. She took something that wasn't hers, to fund something that she should have funded at least half of herself. \n\nThey are not struggling, this dude does not need to feel ashamed or like a freeloader for being a parent. People in here are acting like he needs a job or he's worthless. He has a job. Parenting is a job. Just because we've forgotten this in the last 50 years in some countries does not mean it went away.", "Why would you make it about gender? Gender doesn't matter. The point is hes not a SAHD anymore, any more that a woman would be a SAHM, when the children are in school full time. At that point hes a SAHH, just like she would be a SAHW, and if money is an issue like it sounds like it is, then they need to go get a job and contribute. That is the real world.", "we both agreed. It's the age my mother and her parents agreed to leave us alone at home for more than 2 hour, as by that time we had already learned how to cook, clean, what to do in case of emergency, etc etc.\n\nWe are teaching our kids the same things and hopefully they will have learned them all by the time they are 14, so, unless something happen and we have to reconsider, I will go back to work when Joan is 14.\n\nWhen that happen, our paycheck will be put together and split in the same way they are split now.", "Then what is it?", "Kay then don't get one. No one is requiring you or your relationship partner to stay at home. No one is asking this of you, or demanding it of you. You don't have to have that relationship dynamic. These people decided to be in that dynamic. Therefore, the wife needs to follow the dynamic and not just opt out whenever she feels her money is being threatened. Or, as mentioned, she can leave, and pay child support and alimony which would be given because stay at home spouse is indeed a job, with tangible benefits.", "I'm not saying the OP has to work. The OP already has a job. Like a whole job of tending home and raising kids. It's a hard job. \n\nAnd OPs wife is financially abusive... Taking OPs fun money and spending it without consent...

It's messed up. \n\nThe OP states they are looking to work (which is a good call if someone is being financially abused... Ya know...  Getting your own bank account and setting up your own income so that you aren't subject to the abuse in the same way and can leave when you're ready)..  and so i pointed out OP can work a full time or part time job .. which the OP claims to want to do .. \n\nAnd that it's perfectly safe (barring extenuating circumstances) for his kiddos to be at home after school or before school if he were to work... That they aren't in danger or being neglected by having age appropriate levels of alone time. \n\nAnd if someone has convinced him that he can't ever leave an 11 y.o. and 12 y.o. alone, i have concerns about why someone would be invested in convincing him of that... Because it sounds dangerously manipulative.... Almost like someone has gone out of their way to make sure he can't get a job... Because if he did he'd feel too guilty or like a bad parent... Ya know.. a different type of abuse called weaponizing children and emotional manipulation.", "You're right, he should just divorce her and keep the kids while getting paid alimony and child support. Since that's how the real world works, when a SAHM divorces her husband.\n\nHis wife made a financial agreement, and then went back on it.

OP needs to grow up and have this conversation with his wife, not come to the internet to paint her in a bad brush so he can feel vindicated. A SAHS would not get alimony depending on how long theyve been together, and the courts would calculate child support on his possible income, which is at least full time minimum wage, because staying at home isn't a job.", "That angle is entirely fair and I hadn't considered it! Thank you for taking the time and pointing it out, because I would not have considered manipulation.", "If he divorces her nothing changes, he still needs to get a job. He wont get alimony unless they've been married whatever is required in their state, and its generally only for a few short years, and it'll be minimal because his working power will be calculated into it, meaning the courts do not acknowledge \"stay at home human\" as a job. Child support will also be defendent on who gets custody and the disparity between his calculatable wages and hers, so its not the win you pretend it will be. Thats how the real world works. \n\nThey made a financial agreement that obviously has grey areas. Full Stop. \n\nI'm not jealous, the stay at home life is not for me.

I already answered you multiple times stating exactly this, yet it seems you are purposefully ignoring this.

Did you read the post? They've been together since before the children were born. Dynamics change, as part of a conversation between two people. Not unilaterally one person deciding a thing. You clearly think the \"breadwinner\" deserves more money and more of a vote. That's not how partnerships work. It's equal or it's not.", "SAHP gets alimony and child support during divorces all the time. Since the children are aged 11 and 12, it's been over ten years of marriage. So it'll be permanent alimony as well, until he remarries.\n\nJust because you don't like that you have to work, doesn't mean you get to project that onto someone else. Get over yourself.", "Courts have acknowledged \"stay at home human\" has a job when awarding custody, child support, and alimony. Setting legal precedents.

Here its 7 years, and then its a limited time of alimony with the intent to get the reciever \"back on their feet\" so to say. \n\nHe doesn't say if hes been the SAH since birth. Its also irrelevent since one, kids grow, and two, it depends on where they live.", "Why are you trying to insult me rather than just have this conversation? Triggered much? \n\nAlimony doesn't depend on duration of marriage. Its duration that he's been unemployed to take care of the children. He hasn't stated that so no one should be assuming or commenting on it, its also irrelevant since alimony depends on the state laws and often the reason for divorce.", "Again, why are you incapable of having this discussion without insulting or assuming bias?\n\nCourts do not acknowledge unemployed or a stay at home spouse as being a job. The only reason were on this subject is because the idea that \"He can just divorce her and take all her money haha\" is being brought up, which isn't true legally.

But I also walked home to the neighbour's house, and ate crisps and drank lemonade until my sister knocked for me when she got off the school bus. I'm 44, and still hate being home alone.
