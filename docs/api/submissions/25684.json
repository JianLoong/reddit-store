Now you've made her feel that she can't talk about them, either, because it annoys you and you mock her for it.  I expect things are going to be awfully quiet around your house. (Until she finds a more interesting conversation partner, lol.)  YTA", "Info:  what was average lap length?\n\nWe talking hours or a few minutes.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. If your wife is talking about dogs that much, it\u2019s probably because there are no other interesting subjects between you for her to focus on. Or maybe she just really likes the dogs. I called my dad every day, and both of us spend a chunk of the phone call talking about our respective pets. Even when I don\u2019t really want to hear about it, I will listen. Because that\u2019s what you do for people you love. You listen to them.", "So... you just killed any trust in your communication with your wife.  Now she'll be self-conscious to talk to you in fear that her topics are being counted.  Congrats!  You just made your life with your wife more difficult.  Perhaps you are right that her topics are limited (Maybe... maybe not!)  However, if you are right, it came with a high price!  For making your wife feel insignificant...  YTA!", "YTA. Was it fun humiliating your wife? Did you enjoy being able to REALLY drive home just how annoying she is because you have EVIDENCE. Did you get that delicious sense of superiority because you were wrapping up your case that she was wrong while she was on the backfoot since she wasn't even aware it was an issue. Do you actually like your wife? \n\nYour wife is just connecting with you over something she thinks you have in common. If it bothered you, you could have just spoken to her about it without turning it into a trial. Now she has to worry about what other harmless behaviours you are silently judging and timing so you can spring on her later.\n\nI don't think these NTA answers ever been in a loving relationship where the goal is to communicate in a respectful way rather than score points.", "YTA. \n I wonder if she times how often you are uninteresting.", "INFO: I guess my judgment depends on your answer.  Do you have kids? Does she want kids?  I can\u2019t have kids and it was a huge hit to me.  My dog is my baby and I treat him that way.  It\u2019s a way to channel the love I wish I could give my child.  My husband understands this and indulges in my over the top love and how much I talk about my dog cause he knows I need this.", "You sound jealous and annoyed. Don\u2019t have kids if you can\u2019t handle this with a dog.", "Its all about emotions\nTo us you are not an asshole but we are not the ones you have to sleep next to for the rest of your life\n\nTake the L and be the asshole to her\nMake up and try get her into other activities that maybe take up more time than she has to talk about dogs\n\nOof... Maybe that would make you a manipulative asshole.. It would get the dog Convo down tho", "ESH If we asked your wife there are probably topics that you constantly return to as well. If she put a stopwatch to you that information could be used against your data, but what you did was entirely one sided.

That sounds like good fun. I should do that for my wife.", "NTA. Totally harmless and amusing, if slightly obnoxious, way of making a point. Sometimes you need backup to win an argument! \n\n(although this seems like something a little odd to be annoyed about, but that's probably because I love our dog)", "Could we get some statistics? That would give some clarity but I do imagine if you went to the effort of noting each time she talked about the dogs then it is either rather significant or as you said you\u2019re irritable.\n\nI\u2019ll go with NTA for the moment.", "NTA. I Don\u2019t think it\u2019s a violation but it is kinda weird you felt the need to keep a tally on your stopwatch. Not sure if you two have discussed this before, but that might\u2019ve been a better first step. Also not sure why you used a stopwatch and not the notes app on your phone haha", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He posted the stats but never held a control to compare data against. Also- he did his test when they were separated from the dogs, likely leading to an increase in laps. When I'm away from my pets I also like to talk about what they're up to. OP should've just... communicated his irritation.", "This could very well be something for me to reflect on soo thank you for sharing your take on the situation. \nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll listen and take part in the conversation every time, but it does get to be a drain when it\u2019s for like the hundredth time this week", "We don\u2019t have kids, but we do want them in the future. I understand that my wife is coming from a place of love and adoration, and I aspire to be more like your husband, but sometimes the efforts leave me feeling drained and disingenuous.

But for me also I\u2019m torn because I want her to feel free to talk about whatever is on her mind and especially I want to join her and share her excitement too right?", "Dude, don\u2019t make me do math. What\u2019s the average situation? And more importantly, what do you consider reasonable?", "So over the course of about 4 hours, she talked about the dogs 18 times? Although, imo if it\u2019s just a few seconds, that\u2019s just continuing a thought, so it seems more like 11 times.", "But he shouldn't be looking to gather data to \"win\" an argument.  He's married to her, so he should be looking for a win-win; that's what people do in a healthy marriage.  \n\nIf she's doing something that aggravates him, he should consider a conversation rather than doing something that devalues her attempt to communicate with her husband.", "I posted them", "We\u2019ve discussed it pretty extensively. And this time I pulled the stopwatch out to have some hard numbers for both of our considerations", "This has been a topic of discussion before. Seeing how this has worked out- if I were to have measure on multiple days, where would that land me and what would that make me??", "Then learn how to redirect the conversation, since you are the one with the issue, rather than being passive aggressive about it.", "I think you need to talk to your wife.  Maybe her future might be closer than yours.  My dog is the best boy in the world and everyone loves him but at the same time I recognize why I love and gush over him so much.  Maybe it\u2019s not her need for a child but she might be feeling like something is missing in her life and she\u2019s transferring her love and attention to the dogs instead.  It could just be that she\u2019s not in control of some part of her life but the dogs are something she can control.  Unfortunately I\u2019m going to have to call you the asshole in the situation because of how you handled it.  Timing her was childish.  Sit her down and ask her about her life.  How\u2019s her job going? How\u2019s her friend group doing? Is there anything on her mind that she wants to talk about? Don\u2019t come at her in an accusatory way, she\u2019ll just get defensive.  Here\u2019s how to start \u201cI just want to apologize for timing your conversation.  It was immature and I handled it poorly.  I love our dogs but I love you more and I want us to have conversations that aren\u2019t centered around them.\u201d  Hope that helps", "She sure isn\u2019t going to feel free to talk about whatever she likes or expect that you\u2019re joining her in any excitement. This would crush my desire to communicate with anyone, much less a spouse I\u2019m supposed to be safe to get vulnerable with. It feels like you\u2019re ranking your irritation and desire to be right *and with evidence to back you up* higher than your wife\u2019s connection with you. Why don\u2019t you find better topics or a class to do together for improvement in the breadth of your marital topics. YTA", "I don\u2019t want to do the math either It was about six hours total so every 20 minutes is a fair guess??\nAs far as reason goes, I feel it\u2019s reasonable to listen about things people love to talk about because that makes them happy and that\u2019s their outlet and that\u2019s good to embrace peoples joys and passions.. On the other hand, I don\u2019t want to talk about dogs THAT much\u2026 Soo all in all, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to be a buzzkill but man it gets a lil exhausting being enthused for the hundredth time this week about our dogs", "There were some times where I realized I forgot and just hit lap twice so the timing isn\u2019t entirely accurate", "It really depends on their relationship. If they argue for sport and joke around a lot it\u2019s no big deal. Think of the my cousin Vinny scene with the leaky faucet, my wife and I used to go back and forth, challenging each other when one of us would make an \u201cunqualified statement\u201d - all in fun. Now we have two kids (and a dog) and there\u2019s just no time for that kind of thing. OP did not seem to be acting maliciously IMHO.", "And... that's an even bigger YTA!", "Is it in minutes:seconds:10th.100th seconds?", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily an AH thing to measure things in your life \u2014 it\u2019s a question of how you measure it and what you do with that info. Your wife needs to be reassured that there\u2019s no inherent right or wrong number of times to mention dogs per hour. Doing this is often a way of processing the outside world for certain people. I break all my personal decisions into math equations and I\u2019ve seen many other engineer types among my patients do the same. That said, you do need to try to find a way to bridge  to a \u201clanguage\u201d that your wife speaks. Just keep the numbers in your head if you do feel like you need to wrap your head around the world in a more mathematical way and learn how to just say \u201cI\u2019m tired about talking about our dogs.

This wasn't done in jest...it was a nasty move meant to make a point and humiliate her.  I agree that in a healthy relationship, joking around can happen.  My husband and I do this all the time, but it's clear from what he wrote that wasn't the case here.", "Hours:Minutes:Seconds.TenthsHundrethsThousandths\nA lot of them are minutes", "That is a completely different survey that only an AH would get to the bottom of lol", "Your wife would fit right in with my SO and friends.", "Well, she married a boring guy, that's why she has to talk about the dogs."]}
