We all were friends and got along pretty well, but one of them (Alice) was someone that at times would upset us. She always would forgot to lock the front door, would lose her keys, or would leave her keys in the front door, despite us asking her not to do this (she probably did this an estimated 20 times this year). She made a few comments that we found racially insensitive (though she doesn\u2019t have this intent, it\u2019s still not okay to say), she is a bit messier than I would like, and she sleeps on the couch all the time, which is a bit annoying as it dominates the common space. She also has just made insulting comments at times but somehow doesn\u2019t seem aware that she\u2019s being insulting.\n\nOne of my roommates (we\u2019ll call her Jade) and I brought these things all up to her one day, and she started crying, which was unfortunate because we didn\u2019t want to make her cry. Ever since, we\u2019ve had a more distanced relationship with her. We\u2019re looking to renew the lease soon, but we want to renew it without her. She isn\u2019t expecting this, though our fourth roommate Sasha who is moving out has told me that Alice made a comment to her that she was a bit nervous about moving in with us because of that day when we voiced the annoyances we have with her. I don\u2019t want her to feel like she\u2019s being ganged up on or for her to be uncomfortable in our space, and I feel like if these issues have not all resolved themselves after they were brought up (she continued to forget/lose her keys even after we had that talk about them) I don\u2019t have the best hope for next year. WIBTA if I told her we want to renew without her? It feels so mean to say, but truthfully, Jade and I have been annoyed with her for months now. I especially feel bad because she likes living with us, we were all close for the majority of the year, and our place is a really good rent price (nearly half of what she would pay if she moved out with friends). She didn\u2019t want to renew this place at all until she heard that we were, and now it\u2019s something she\u2019s looking forward to, while we\u2019re dreading it.\n\nEdit: though we need to renew our lease ASAP, she would have three months to find a new living situation, and potentially could fallback on living with her friends as she originally planned to (though this would cost twice as much as our current rent, so I do feel bad about this alternative)\n\nEdit 2: Alice has said she only wants to renew the lease if Jade and/or I do. She didn\u2019t have any plans to renew until she found out we were staying; Jade and I don\u2019t want to move elsewhere because then none of us would renew and we would be missing out for no reason. Also, the key issue was eventually fixed for the last month we lived together because she put a sign up to help her remember it.

She originally thought that we weren\u2019t staying and made arrangements for elsewhere, she only wants the place if we are staying in it. So, it seems pointless for us to go elsewhere because then no one would renew, and Jade and I want to stay.\n\nI haven\u2019t felt that I want to get along with her much personally ever since she made a comment to me that I found racially insensitive. Since then I have felt distanced from her. I\u2019ve shared with her that it upset me and I want her to be more conscious, and I\u2019ve told her other things (her forgetfulness mainly) that have upset me. I am not the best with confrontation but usually speak on things anyways, but right now I feel like this is a mean thing to say so it is hard for me to bring up, though I know it needs to be said sooner.

She is only renewing because we are renewing, and she has expressed many times that she enjoys living with us and is excited for next year. Though, she has made that comment to Sasha that she was nervous about next year because of that day we confronted her, so I think there is a little worry/hesitation on her end", "I think so too and I have told her I think she should be evaluated for memory/attention issues before. I\u2019ve never met someone who is as forgetful as she is, and she generally seems pretty zoned out and inattentive. She was not intending on renewing at all until we told her that we were renewing, so it is not the place she wants so much as the place with us", "She doesn\u2019t want the lease unless we are staying. She has said this multiple times, and was looking for other living arrangements before she found out we were renewing.

I didn\u2019t want to have the conversation while we were still living together (we all just left for the summer) because that would make everyone uncomfortable but now that we\u2019ve just left this weekend I think it needs to be said. She also did change her behavior in the sense that she stopped making those insensitive comments and now with the reminder of a sign locks the door and doesn\u2019t forget her keys, but the damage has already been done because we had to ask for that so many times that we are incredibly annoyed", "I mean, I feel that where you are living is pretty financially entangled. What exactly are you suggesting I should do instead? Just view this through the lens of if we should live together? I do feel bad that her alternatives will be more expensive", "It\u2019s more than the keys, it\u2019s that we have to tell her things over and over again because she has a poor memory. She\u2019s fed me pork before even though I\u2019ve said countless times this year that I don\u2019t eat pork for religious reasons, she\u2019s eaten people\u2019s food even after they\u2019ve told her not to without asking before, she loses her things often which makes leaving the house with her annoying (we once spent two hours looking for her phone at the grocery store), and then she generally annoys us. I\u2019ve had 6 roommates in my life, 4 of them I was never annoyed with, one I was rarely annoyed with, but with her I am constantly annoyed. But I agree that we should stray from bringing emotion into the conversation and stick to listing reasoning", "What do you mean? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any gaslighting in this situation", "You could preface your conversation with exactly that.  \"This feels so mean to ask,  because you're my friend,  but I really don't feel like we're compatible for living together.\"", "If you can handle the potential social repercussions of lying then you could always tell her you aren't renewing and do it behind her back.\n\nBut that could backfire in an incredible number of ways. Probably best to be honest. If you can make it work in your favour, all the better for you.\n\nBut you might just *not be able to renew without her* if she sticks to her guns and then you'll be in the same issue.\n\nI really hope you can find an outcome that works for you and your remaining housemate, my advice is to just be honest and do it as just you or your other roommate with her (the other can always be muted on a phone call to listen).\n\nBest of luck!", "This could be an opportunity to find an even better place and possibly an even better price, there isn\u2019t only one great place in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s gonna get dicey because I assume you\u2019re all on the lease.

I.e., We enjoy you as a person, however we're not comfortable renewing the lease with you as we've discussed the door issue and it continues to happen. If it were simply dishes or housework,  maybe it'd be different,  but this is a huge safety issue. It's unfair to us to have to worry about our physical safety after we've already tried just talking to you about it and so for that reason we think it'd be best if you moved forward with your original plan to move into the other place with your friends.", "You have a social issue.  Deal with the social aspects of it and nothing else.  If you start making adjustments due to finances then your social construct will fall apart and no amount of cash will make anyone happy.\n\nExample, my wife is from another state and thinks it is second only to heaven. She used to repeatedly tell me the only reason she lives in my native state is because of me.  So I gave her an analogy, that she sees a tub of crap with a shiny object she loved floating in the middle.  The only thing that will make her happy is to be close to it and is willing to sit in the crap for that reason.  As time goes on, she will realize she is sitting in crap and is only doing it for this shiny object.  It wont take long for her to grow to regret then detest this object as it is forcing her to sit in crap.  \n\nIf you add money to a social situation and allow that to influence a decision, some time down the road you will grow more and more unhappy.  You will eventually get to a point where you will now pay an inflated amount to get out of the original dynamic.  When you get here, you will have already grown to detest the person that you \"sacrificed\" financially for to accommodate their deal.\n\nJust be up front with her and let her know the deal.  This sucks but you dont get anywhere in life avoiding sticky situations.", "Yes - tbh the issues with the keys are enough to not invite her back as a roommate. Horrifying that she puts all of your personal security at risk on the regular and thinks nothing of it.", "I get it that there are a lot of things that you would like to list, but that is just going to overwhelmed her and she will start crying, and as you list all the things that she does that annoy you, you are going to get more annoyed.\n\nAnother point is that in these types of situations one side is expected to sympathize with the other. You are asking the question in your post because in the previous discussion she started crying so you sympathized with her feeling overwhelmed. Avoid that. Put the discussion in a frame that gets her to sympathize with you. You can't achieve that by expecting her to sympathize with how annoying you find her behavior.\n\nSo keep it simple. The keys. You don't feel safe, it is stressful. You mentioned this to her before and the situation hasn't improved. For your mental health and safety you don't want to go on like this.", "I like this actually and may include it. I was thinking of asking her if she\u2019s felt more uncomfortable/distanced with us since the day we confronted her about those issues, and then ask if she thinks it\u2019s the best idea for us to all be living together, and that I\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s been more withdrawn from us since and want her to be comfortable in our living space. If she still says it\u2019s right for her, I may then say I don\u2019t want to be mean but I don\u2019t think this is a good idea and explain why", "Yeah. I originally told her we weren\u2019t sure and wanted to wait out until she secured other living arrangements before telling her that we decided to renew. However, since we are all subleasing this summer she was going to find out anyways when we signed the paperwork for that, so Jade mentioned it to her and now she wants to live with us. At this point we have no choice but to voice to her that we don\u2019t want to live with her or be stuck with her for another year, since she is set on living with us. If she really sticks to it we\u2019d find another place, but that would be unfortunate since she wouldn\u2019t even renew if we left, so then everyone would miss out. Thank you for the advice and well wishes!", "We live in one of the highest rent price area codes in the US. We pay 3/4 of what most pay for our size apartment. I actually don\u2019t know anyone or of any place that has a better deal than we do on rent. The absolute cheapest places you can find in our area are 200 more a month, and they generally aren\u2019t even as nice. We wouldn\u2019t be able to find something better. We\u2019re all on the lease until September, we want to renew for the next year without her. She originally did not want to renew here when she thought we were all leaving, but since finding out Jade and I were staying she has wanted to renew with us", "Well, the key issue was eventually resolved for the last month only because she put up a sign that helped her to remember them. So, I feel she would easily counter that and say it isn\u2019t an issue anymore despite it being one for so long. It\u2019s more than just the keys, it\u2019s a lot of small things that we ask for that never get resolved despite us asking countless times. She\u2019s very forgetful and it\u2019s frustrating", "Okay, I see what you are saying. I agree that it should be addressed as soon as possible so she can make other arrangements, and I don\u2019t think things will get better as Jade and I have just gotten progressively annoyed with her for the past two months or so", "Don\u2019t ask her if she thinks it\u2019s a good idea for her to stay. Be straightforward that it\u2019s not working for you (and Jade if she\u2019s willing to have the conversation), but don\u2019t let her think that if she believes it\u2019s working that you will go along with it. The least mean way is to be honest that you like her as a friend, but being a roommate isn\u2019t working. You may lose the friendship if she can\u2019t take that, but it\u2019s better than another year of supervising her behavior. \n\nAlso, if you will be looking for another two flat mates and you are all in the same social circle, word will get around, so be prepared to explain that it wasn\u2019t a good fit and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t ask her to stay.", "You can be the best of friends or family & love each other,  BUT not be able to live with each other.

It might work for her to live with you & the other girl, but it doesn't work for the 2 of you.", "It\u2019s hard to find the good deals but they\u2019re out there, time, perseverance, and focus will help you find a better deal.", "Then maybe talk from the compatibility standpoint.  \n\nWe really enjoy you as a friend,  but it's been incredibly frustrating to have to ask you about things over and over.  We don't want to be your mother,  we want to be your friend. Living together is hurting our friendship and we don't want that.", "OP's repeatedly said no. Are you someone who can't accept no for an answer?", "Truthfully we\u2019re not interested in looking. It doesn\u2019t make sense to miss out on this place and have none of us renew it.

That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not entitled to do it but like it\u2019s okay to feel bad when the thing you choose to do will hurt someone\u2019s feelings. That\u2019s the trade off.", "Good luck!"]}
