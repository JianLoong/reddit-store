Way to go for teaching your daughter that her actions have consequences. I hope you hold her accountable until every last cent is paid back.

In addition to repaying the cost of the dress, I hope there are more immediate consequences like grounding, taking away phone privileges, etc. Hers were the actions of a spoiled child having a tantrum, not those of a maturing young woman. If this is normal behavior for Bethany, you should have her evaluated for mental illness as well. Another thought: you are paying very large sums of money for parties and dresses, so she may have no context for just how much money $3000 is - getting a job to work that off will be a real eye-opener for Bethany.", "Assuming Bethany finds a job that pays the federal minimum in the US, it will take her ~414 hours of work, it will take her about a year to pay it if she works 8 hours a week.

My analogy was not good, I get it. I'm just more worried about the girls' relationship with each other, why did Bethany tear up her sister's dress in the first place? Everyone wants to grab their pitchforks to force this child to work for the first time in her life to pay for the dress. I've even gotten several messages that she should get a felony which is crazy to say about a child, it would ruin her future. I think counseling for the whole family is a better alternative. If OP puts Bethany to work, basically for free, she will keep resenting her sister.\n\nEdit 2: Spoke with my wife, she agreed with everyone, Bethany has to pay for the damages, she should also get all her electronics taken away, because it will be a while before she gets that job.

Luckily the store has close to the same dress in her size right now.

Maybe having to work and learn what goes into making $3000 will give her some perspective.", "NTA\n\nAn argument over a tv shouldn\u2019t lead to very expensive dress damage.\nYour daughter over reacted.

Figure out why she\u2019s so upset about the dress though, and do NOT let up about her paying you back even if she starts showing remorse, property damage like this is unacceptable at 6 years old let alone 16.

Hear me out. NTA.\n\nYes what Bethany did was absolutely horrid and she deserves to have to pay everything back. Yes you did everything right by repaying your SO and his ex so that they could get a replacement dress, but, at the same time, I do not think you are completely blameless in this situation.\n\nYou claim that this is the first instance of Bethany acting out. If they\u2019ve been living together, her and Maria, for at least 8 years, then I think this issue, at least if it was only on Bethany\u2019s end, would\u2019ve reared it\u2019s ugly head already. If you say it hasn\u2019t then obviously someone else\u2019s actions or words (probably yours) are playing into Bethany\u2019s thoughts and actions more recently. That, or it\u2019s been going on the whole time and you\u2019ve been completely blind to it. \n\nEveryone also seems to be operating under the assumption that why Bethany acted out was that she was just completely unable to see someone else have \u2018their day\u2019. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple though. And while it may have a little to do with culture, it\u2019s not just completely related to that either. I think how Bethany sees it is..yes\u2026she did get a sweet 16, though whether the same amount was spent on it or not, is besides the point for now.  But she, in my mind, is 100% operating under the assumption that Maria is going to get this thousands of dollars quincenera and then she is also going to get a thousands of dollars sweet 16. And depending on how a family chooses to show love, such as buying things, can absolutely make someone feel like you love them less if less is spent on them. \n\nOf course, in any child that has a healthy dynamic with their parent, this issue almost never comes up. The jealousy never happens. So why now? Too often, we see stories on this site where, in order to try to facilitate the blending of two families, one parent will love bomb the other parent\u2019s child, to try to get them more comfortable with the new situation. I urge you to reflect and make sure that, if this was what you did to try and ease the blending, that you didn\u2019t do so at the expense of letting your relationship with your bio kid fester. Or, even if you think you didn\u2019t, you need to make sure that Bethany doesn\u2019t feel like you did. \n\nUltimately, this is a complex issue that is going to require therapy. Probably both individual and family, because as I said previously, this is not just a Bethany issue, one way or another. And it needs to be done so soon, or otherwise infestered emotional wounds will rear their ugly heads through impulsive actions the moment anyone brings up a sweet 16 for Maria.", "NTA \u2026 thank you for being a good parent and holding Bethany accountable.", "NTA: Sounds like your daughter needs to learn the hard way. Stand firm.", "nta. she doesn\u2019t understand that a quince is not just a huge party where they spend a bunch of money. it has a big cultural and religious background where pretty much every aspect has a meaning. it\u2019s a ceremony, whereas sweet sixteens are basically just a huge party. destroying a $3k dress is a felony and they could take legal action against you and your daughter", "Ask her what the hell will happen if she works for a company and ruins, one of their pieces of equipment.

I see a lot of top comments regarding the cost of the dress and the age of the daughter who did the deed. Both valid points. But we are not devoting enough attention to a very important detail; this girl attacked a *whole family*.\n\nA Quince\u00f1era is a very important milestone for a Hispanic lady, a transition from childhood to adulthood similar to a Bat Mitzvah. If they went so far as to get \"the dress\", then there is also a long line of people who sponsor other important details of the event, like the cake, the photographer, etc. There will be family members who have been waiting *years* for this event,  putting in hours of overtime and effort to get just the right outfit,  just the right gift. There are very likely people coming in from out of town, taking time off of work to come in for this. \n\nThis is an event that is right up there with weddings and funerals. Where family members who haven't seen each other in years gather. Ever since the Covid lockdowns, that has an extra level of importance. And to ruin the centerpiece of that event affected many people on a deep and personal level.\n\nPersonally,  I would like to see that this girl is given a chance to publically apologize at the party. This will give her the chance to think about what she did and learn from this experience. Part of moving into adulthood is taking responsibility and making amends.

She\u2019d probably have a program where if she successfully completed the requirements, charges would be dropped.\n\nFor my unsolicited advice, I\u2019d consider giving her a \u201cprivate probation.\u201d Where she has x months to pay off the dress, maintain healthy relationship, complete community service, maintain therapy, grounded physically and electronically, and keep a strict curfew of 8 pm (no dances).\n\nI\u2019d consider sitting her down in a room without electronics and walking her through the consequences of a felony or record. Then I\u2019d say, imma either give you the lightest punishment the court could give you, or we can let the court determine your punishment and you can risk incarceration. I\u2019m going to leave you in a room for 30 minutes (WITHOUT ELECTRONICS) while you decide if you want to risk senior year locked up. If you get bored, imagine this for a whole fucking year. Think about your dreams and then think about how much harder they will be as a felon. Whole careers will be excluded from you. Academic opportunities and aid will be excluded. Renting will be cumbersome. Finish by saying, you Bethany brought this upon yourself. It pains me to punish you, but this is not my fault, not your sister\u2019s fault, it is your sole fault.

I\u2019m well aware of the culture and the importance, and all of the social pressures behind a quincea\u00f1era, but that\u2019s just insane. They need to stop spoiling that daughter by getting her whatever she wants, the only reason she wants to dress that expensive is because of toxic competition and one-upmanship between girls. She needs to deal with the actual social difficulties instead of them just lavishing money on her to feel like she\u2019s supported and loved.\n\nYou should determine what is a reasonable amount for a quinceanera dress and have them pay for it. Your daughter acting out is obviously a symptom of struggling with your complex family dynamics and feeling like she\u2019s undervalued and unappreciated. So the first and foremost you need to make sure that there are consequences for her to take responsibility but at the same time make them reasonable. I seriously doubt that you would be spending $3000 on her prom dress that she\u2019ll never wear again. And think about how many hours she would have to work at minimum wage in order to net $3000, that\u2019s such a large amount that it will be detrimental to her high school academics. Life is going to saddle her with enough arbitrary expenses like student loans and medical care that she doesn\u2019t need to deal with the stress of an unplayable debt in high school.\n\nSit down and discuss what is a reasonable amount and make sure it\u2019s something similar to what you\u2019ve spent on her for important occasions. Make her pay that much and to make sure she earns every penny through a good job that teaches responsibility and hard work. But it should be not anywhere near $3000. Meanwhile, I suggest you visit a family counselor, or some sort of professional who can help you deal with the dynamics of having kids from multiple marriages and ensuring that they all feel they are being treated equally.

But maybe not necessarily just because she didn't want the step sister to get attention. As someone who had a lot of friends and relatives that had quinceaneras they are a bigger deal than a sweet 16. Not money wise but in general. It's not just a party it also involves a religious ceremony at a church. The family usually makes a big deal during the planning due to the meaning behind the event as celebrating them becoming an adult. Even on a smaller budget, the planning process is actually very similar to that of a wedding. A sweet 16 is just a party, but a quinceanera is an all-day event most of the time. The dresses are also huge and most resemble wedding dresses due to the traditional meaning of the quiceanera being that they can date and eventually marry.\n\n So i think what may be going on is that even though money wise, they are around the same. The planning process, dress, and decorations appear more elaborate than what her party did. But it's not due to money it's just the style and how it may appear. Also, a quinceanera, the main focus is the dress, and a sweet 16 is more focused on the venue, food, and music. So i think the daughter seeing the dress is flashier than what hers was may be what the problem is. She may not understand the meaning and religious aspects of it and just thinks that her party is larger. She may be feeling left out if she's been seeing and hearing them talk about it.\n\n She is obviously still in the wrong and should have never destroyed the dress. I'm just saying that i think that she may be jealous due to not understanding the reason for the differences and may just think that the step sister is being favored when that isn't the case. Especially if she has never seen anyone throw a quinceanera and just looks at it as a party, seeing it done so big without knowing why it's like that, could be mistaken for favoritism. OP was definitely right to make her daughter pay it back and she should stick to that punishment. The daughter should have just asked more about it than assuming and getting upset.", "Depending on how recently their families were blended, it may also be frustration due to extreme change.

Sometimes they mix when you blend families but think of different religious households.

Culturally it is a bigger deal than a sweet 16 and can be very similar to throwing a wedding. If the daughter doesn't know the Cultural and religious side of it she may think it's the step dad favoring her step sister when its not the case. I have seen quinceaneras with a smaller budget than what OP said and those look pretty elaborate compared to a sweet 16 with them spending as much as they did its likely a lot more than what i have seen. So the step daughter may be comparing the differences based on looks and by the way they talk about it and spend time planning compared to hers. She was definitely wrong to destroy the dress and OP should make her pay it back. But i also think they should have a talk with the daughter and explain the meaning behind it because i think OP telling her it's like her sweet 16 is what is making her jealous it's not like a sweet 16 its bigger so if she's thinking it's supposed to be the same and she sees all these differences it's probably making her wonder why she didn't get the same treatment.", "Honestly, I\u2019d LOVE that party (and I\u2019m three decades out from 16).", "All important question: P&P 1996 TV adaptation or Keira Knightley version?", "That sounds awesome to me", "Hell I didn't even get THAT, the only actual birthday party I can remember is when I turned 19 and some friends threw me a surprise party.

Seems straightforward that if you destroy something on purpose you pay for it.", "Bethany will need to work for quite a long time to repay the cost of the dress. This will be a good lesson in economics (how hard we all have to work to pay for things) and in the extent of the damage her actions caused. Hopefully she will learn a lesson in controlling her emotions as well. \n\nI'd suggest not letting her off this hook until she pays it back, and I'd also suggest therapy.  You can make it \"family\" therapy if it helps get her there. For some reason  Bethany is having trouble  sharing and enjoying good things for others.\n\nIs Bethany's dad in the picture?  I hope Maria is ok and her quinceneara is a wonderful day for you all.", "NTA (you're definitely not a jerk) - you're teaching Bethany a valuable lesson in responsibility. What she did constitutes criminal damage and it's a reasonably high priced item. She should absolutely pay restitution. \n\nThe main thing though is that she is 16 years old and too old to not understand right and wrong, especially when committing such a vindictive act. If this, as you say, is the first time she's done this then there may be something bigger causing her to act out. If it isn't the first time or she's prone to this kind of thinking, then you also need to get to the root of it and correct that behaviour while she's still a child under your roof (& at least theoretically under your control). Have you considered putting her in therapy? She clearly has some kind of resentment brewing and it probably should be addressed by someone qualified and impartial.\n\nI hope you find some resolution and Maria gets her dress in time.", "I think you also need to pay for\nsome serious therapy for your daughter and maybe family therapy. You should be just as worried about her right now as the dress. What she did is not normal and she seems quite emotionally disturbed.", "Of course, ruining such an expensive dress is stupid, on the other hand, don't corner her. Try to get her to explain why she did it. If the problem isn't deeper than that, arguing over the TV probably isn't the trigger for such an action. Talk to Maria about how she feels about it, why she thinks her half-sister did it. Do they both live with you permanently or not? What kind of relationship does Bethany have with her stepfather? In short, there could be a lot of factors.  Don't get swept up in the wave of hatred towards your daughter. Don't humiliate her. Money isn't the most important thing, family relationships are more important.", "I'm thinking from her reaction, Bethany's sweet 16 party probably didn't include a $3,000 dress. OP also didn't mention the rest of the expenses for the quinceanara, which almost certainly run into the thousands if they're spending so much on a dress... I'd imagine OP and husband are paying half of those costs as well. It kinda sounds like stepsister is getting a catered professional event more expensive than my wedding for her 15th birthday -- at least, her dress cost more than mine! I'm wondering if comparing Bethany's sweet 16 to this gala is at all fair when it comes to the relative cost and effort being put into it. Seeing her mom shell out thousands of dollars to give her stepsister a 15th birthday party after she got a $100 budget to grill some hot dogs in the back yard for her sweet 16 would certainly explain the sudden hostility.", "I really doubt the older daughter knew the budget for the younger daughter's party would be 10x or more higher than her party.", "Maybe they did spend more than $1,000 on the sweet 16, we don't know how extravagent the party was, but my bet is the total cost for that party was less than the cost of the dress and no where near what the total cost will be for everything. \n\nI have friends that told both daughters you each have the same budget for a Quince, you can decide to have the party or you can take the money and use it to help pay for college. One had the party and the other used it for school (they were 16 months apart in age).", "If it was my car, I'd sue her and her parents.  And certainly press charges. \n\nIf it was my kid, you're damn right she'd be paying that off.  It's an excellent opportunity for her to learn lasting real-world consequences and responsibility, in either scenario. \n\nNever working does not void you of liability.  It does not make you immune to the consequences of your actions and using kid-glove tactics will never ensure she doesn't do something so terrible again.  You're too willing to give her an easy out. Your mentality encourages criminal behavior with no consideration for the victim.", "Im talking about being a teenager, both boys and girls are controlled by hormonal mood swings at that age", "Mexican here, not really important, how it is celebrated depends on the state, but it's mostly for rich families or traditional families wanting their daughters introduced to the society in hopes of getting her candidates for marriage.", "not just Mexican.", "It doesn't seem like Bethany understands the significance of the quinceanera though or I doubt she would have acted out in that way. This will be something she recalls for years and will be something she might do with her daughter and now those memories will include Bethany's bad behavior.", "except if you bothered to pay attention and read further, you would know this kind of extreme reaction is an outlier, aka hasn't happened before, and the fact OP is holding her fully responsible really proves you wrong that she is spoiling her.\n\nA parent who spoils their children wouldn't hold them accountable for their actions.", "Dude you know nothing about them other than this instance and the mom is making her pay it back.", "Show me this was better blended than separate.", "Growing into adulthood really has a lot to do with making peace with the wolf inside you that urges destruction as a reaction to big feelings.\n\nCounseling is definitely in order for this teen.

This means she doesn't understand some abstract concecpts that adults might understand.

Also, she has no right to expect that Maria's support from her mother obligates OP or anyone else to make sure they receive gifts of identical value. \n\nBethany should have to pay for the dress and a penalty for the inconvenience her jealousy has caused the whole family. She may also need counseling to help her process this without ending up even more resentful.", "And maybe not be allowed to go to the party?  I imagine a lot of people there might give her grief for what she did.", "I totally agree with your comments and OP would be the AH if she didn't punish her daughter appropriately. It was a nasty and cruel thing to do to her sister, she fully knew what she was doing too. I hope you make it clear to Maria that you fully support her,plus husband. They need to see you take action here or you could really damage their trust in you.", "Yeah, while I don't think OP has done anything wrong by punishing her daughter for destroying the dress, I do think it absolutely matters how the budget of the quince compared to the budget of the other daughter's sweet sixteen that OP compared it to. I do think this behaviour likely came from some perceived unfairness in one daughter getting a huge milestone party with a dress that costs more than many people's wedding gowns. I'd love to hear the answer to these questions.", "Not OPs ex, it's her husbands ex who paid for half that is (very understandably) pissed about the whole situation because her daughters dress was ruined (and probably put a dent into the party, because Maria might not be able to get a decent replacement in time).", "I think OP means her husbands ex and that she is pissed about the dress.", "Right?! If she keyed someones car and cause 3000 in damage no one would be saying \"well she didn't really understand because her brains not developed\" but because it was a dress and a \"girl thing\" it's being treated like oh well.
