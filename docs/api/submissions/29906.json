I am sorry but what your daughter did was cruel, wrong, narcissistic, and absolutely terrible. She needs to learn that she cannot get her way just because the attention is not about her. You absolutely need to stick up for Maria in this position. And if you don't, then you will be an a******", "NTA But your own daughter sounds like a brat. Wow. Does she act like this a lot?", "while she is obviously an asshole. how much money did you spend on your daughters sweet 16? this is some serious jealousy shit.", "Nta. Your daughter had her time in the spotlight during her sweet 16 and now it\u2019s her sisters turn and she doesn\u2019t want to share it so she\u2019s lashing out. Honestly paying it back is the least punishment she should receive.", "Nta youre teaching your kid actions have consequences. Who is saying your the AH? The 16 yr old who destroyed a gifts drew right before her party because she was jealous?", "NTA. But you need to get that entitlement and vindictiveness under control NOW or she is going to suffer as she gets older. That is a horrible response to a petty argument and it's likely one day she might go too far.", "NTA and a good lesson for her", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry but you raised a spoiled brat", "NTA. But Bethany sure as hell is. Not only should she have to pay for the dress, but she should be losing ALL privileges for a good long while. Her behavior was beyond unacceptable.", "I am convinced  that  this is a better written  version  of  an earlier  post  in which  the  very  same thing  happened  to  a gifted dress except  it was ruined  by a spoiled  six year old. If this really  happened  you wouldn't  have  been at fault  but I don't  think  it  did.", "NTA. Your 16 year old destroyed someone else's property. It is her responsibility to make restitution. \n\nThis isn't taking sides, it's good parenting. And it wouldn't be a bad idea to impress upon Bethany that if this were the property of someone other than a family member, the police or court system would probably be involved.  She's fortunate that her parent is willing to work out a repayment plan with her instead.", "NTA. Well done for teaching your daughter accountability. That is an important lesson that way too many young people are not getting these days.", "NTA but what\u2019s wrong with your daughter?", "OMG, no, you are NTA. You are holding her accountable. This behavior is unacceptable and she needs to learn to be respectful. Her behavior illustrates immaturity and she lacks the skills to solve problems with words. \n\nYou dont destroy property because you disagree with someone, or youre jealous or she made her angry. She needs to be held accountable and this is a great time to teach her a lesson.\n\nShe needs to apologize and be remorseful for her actions. This is not ok.", "Speaking as a parent albeit without stepchildren, a firm NTA.  Bethany is old enough to understand that actions have consequences and she's just learnt a major one the hard way.  Kudos to you for stepping in to resolve the situation in a fair way to both Maria and her parents and in addition for both allocating more time to Bethany before this happened and insisting she needs to get a job to pay reparations.  \n\nAt her age Bethany is going to find it takes a long time to earn $3k but the experience will do her good for finding a job after school or college plus will teach her the value of money and depending on the job may even mature her too.", "NTA She needs to learn there are consequences to her actions.", "NTA you\u2019re a great parent and handled that perfectly. You\u2019re teaching her responsibility and accountability and making sure your stepdaughter feels safe and equally loved by you", "NTA You break it, you buy it.", "NTA but whooo boy that's a lot of anger. What's that all about? Probably worth finding out, I'd say.", "NTA\n\nQuinceanera dresses aren't cheap and your daughter is old enough to know better.", "NTA. But I wud suggest u to talk to her and make her realise her mistake instead of just punishing her, which might lead to u two drifting apart.", "NTA! Her actions had very tangible financial implications as well as the emotional ones. She is absolutely responsible for earning the money to fix her own mistake. It isn\u2019t a punishment, it\u2019s literally the direct consequences of her choice, and she\u2019s lucky that you have enough money to essentially loan her the payment for the replacement dress up front.  She effectively signed herself up for buying her step-sister a $3K dress. \n\nIt does seem like something more than just dealing with the financial outcomes is needed here though. I\u2019m sure emotions are high on all sides, and that\u2019s not going to just dissipate without some more complex discussions and parenting.", "NTA.  Bethany deliberately ruined a dress. She has to pay for it. If she had done this to a total stranger, would she claim you're choosing the stranger? If Maria had ruined one of her dresses, would she just let it go?  Bethany's very close to becoming an adult. It's time she realizes that comes with responsibilities. \n\nI wonder what Bethany would say after reading some of these comments - because I doubt you'll see many, if any, YTA. Or would she complain that you put this out to the world?", "NTA, handled this well, this had to be done", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is the jerk and she needs to get a grip on life, especially if she's 16 AND already had a sweet sixteen. Some kids don't get to have one. If she's jealous of Maria and the party she's having, then she needs to talk to you or your husband, not get petty revenge.", "NTA\n\nWow! your daughter is a nasty entitled AH\n\nYou are right to make her pay back every last penny. you just cannot allow this sort of jealous behaviour", "Actions meet consequences.

She knew what she was doing was wrong. And let\u2019s be honest, she knew what she was doing was a *crime*. \n\nTell her she can get a job and pay back the money or her stepsister and her parents can file a police report. \n\nI know that sounds harsh, but your daughter needs a wake up call. Otherwise she\u2019ll do something like this to someone else, and she\u2019ll end up going to jail.", "\u201cit is a large amount and she was jealous\u201d\n\nyeah. she did something very bad for the worst most petty reason. she needs a serious punishment for a serious lapse in judgment and empathy. extremely fucked up behaviour. seeming not to see the problem with her actions at all. tbh i\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ground her and take her phone away as well, but you do you i guess. nta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's 16 not 5 years old. In 2 years she will be 18. If Maria was my daughter, Bethany wouldn't be allowed at the party. She can stay home grounded,  she destroyed the dress what's next? The cake? Or decorations?.  What she did was uncalled for. I would no longer trust her with any of the party things. Does Bethany at least seem remorseful? If not she can stay home.", "NTA. Way to go for teaching your daughter that her actions have consequences. I hope you hold her accountable until every last cent is paid back. This is not about you choosing your DIL over your daughter. You're showing her that what she did is not okay and is not fair to Maria. Bethany is being a spoiled and entitled brat. Sorry, not sorry. She knew what she was doing and was just looking for an excuse to ruin Maria's party. You even went out of your way to get Bethany a dress for Maria's party that she does't even deserve. I would go as far as taking that dress back as well.", "NTA. Bethany is old enough to get behind the wheel of a car. She needs to learn impulse control and that actions have consequences. In addition to repaying the cost of the dress, I hope there are more immediate consequences like grounding, taking away phone privileges, etc. Hers were the actions of a spoiled child having a tantrum, not those of a maturing young woman. If this is normal behavior for Bethany, you should have her evaluated for mental illness as well. Another thought: you are paying very large sums of money for parties and dresses, so she may have no context for just how much money $3000 is - getting a job to work that off will be a real eye-opener for Bethany.", "Assuming Bethany finds a job that pays the federal minimum in the US, it will take her ~414 hours of work, it will take her about a year to pay it if she works 8 hours a week. I'm not entirely sure paying back is the right approach here, taking her phone, tablet, electronics away for a very long time might be easier to accomplish than asking a 16 year old for $3k.", "They are so expensive.

Keep firm, or she will grow up to be a nasty and entitled person.", "Thing is doesn't sound like OP paid for Maria's dress.  Maria's father and mother did.", "I spent a lot for her sweet sixteen party around 4,000 for the venue and all that. Her party I think is around 6,000 in total but the cost is split between my husband and his ex. So he really spent 3000 on her party.\n\nThe difference in the dress I got her is a lot. I only spent 450 on a dress she picked out for the party. You wear a basically a prom dress as a guest to a quinceanera not the huge fluffy dress that Maria is going to wear", "Doesn\u2019t matter that\u2019s between Maria\u2019s mom and dad", "OP probably didn\u2019t spend any money on Maria\u2019s dress.  From the post it sounds like her husband and Maria\u2019s mother bought the dress. Plus I\u2019m sure Maria\u2019s family is also contributing to the cost of the party since it is a big part of Mexican culture.", "Bethany can\u2019t be trusted to behave at the party or unattended at home.", "Taking away the things won\u2019t teach her the value of things. Paying back something she ruined will teach her that money is hard to get. Yes it\u2019ll take a long while to repay depending on where and how many hours she works but it will teach her responsibility. She\u2019s not a young kid, she\u2019s 16. She\u2019s going into the real world soon where things like this have can have big consequences", "Bethany did a very bad, wrong, mean thing and I agree that she needs to make restitution for the dress. Has she acted out before like this? Or done anything worrisome?", "I went on a website for Quinceanera dresses and the cheapest ones I saw were $1700. Your daughter deserves to have to pay back the $3000.", "NTA - You spent a huge deal on her party, more than is being spent on Maria.\n\n\nI was wondering if there was some huge disparity in how they were treated but your daughter is being absolutely unreasonable for no reason at all.\n\nI think this is the perfect way to teach her a lesson, if she did this to someone outside the family, it would be a case of criminal damage so she is lucky this is all that's happening.", "I agree.\n\nTaking phone, tablet and other electronics for \u201cx\u201d amount of months is a slap on the wrist, in my opinion.\n\nMaria\u2019s parents pressing charges would\u2019ve been harsh. Having the daughter work and pay off that $3000 debt is fine, in my opinion.", "Agreed. She will only learn if she has to pay it back no matter how long it takes. I don't see it as a punishment but as a necessary life lesson she will grow and learn from. And I'm a pretty permissive parent in many respects but this has to happen. She has crossed a line. Drawn in sharpie.", "I understand, I just don't think it's fair for her to work a whole year to pay it off, considering she goes to school full time, while an adult would take a month of saving to make that same money, that's all I'm trying to get to.", "This was the first thing to this extent. Usually it\u2019s just arguing, neither have never destroyed each others stuff before.", "Ummm when summer comes she can just work more hours and it will probably be paid off by the middle of the summer\n\nAlso I am sure she can work somewhere that doesn\u2019t pay minimum I know the movie theater starts at 10 an hour", "An adult also has other bills to pay and won't likely be able to save an extra 3k in a month. Personally, after all my bills are paid, it would take me something like 9 months to save that amount extra.", "Well that's good it's not a pattern, that would be concerning. How does she feel today about what she did? Also how are you getting a replacement dress? Your husband's ex who paid for half must be livid.", "Well, how many hours would it take you and your partner to pay for it? 300? If that's the case, then it would make sense, but if you guys can save that money in, say, 100 hours of work, it's not fair that she has to work 300. I'm just looking at the numbers here.", "She thinks I am being unfair at the moment, they called up the store and are asking for express time.  Luckily the store has close to the same dress in her size right now. They need to order if she wants the exact same dress which will be a fee for us and I am worried the stuff won\u2019t be done in time. This is a discussion with Maria if she wants to chance it or get the one in store and do tailoring basically tomorrow \n\nEx is pissed", "Oh gosh, Maria needs to get a different dress! Not the one she had chosen first? I really hope she likes the one that's in the store right now. Not knowing if it will be done in time would be a major stressor, as would having to pay an exorbitant amount for a rush fee. It's hard to believe that Bethany thinks you are being unfair right now, she sees the whole mess that this has caused. She probably feels bad but won't admit it because then she's looking at herself and what she did."]}
