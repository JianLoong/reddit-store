I\u2019m gay, so that was hard on me growing up. In my 20s, my grandpa died and left me a large chunk of inheritance. It was enough to put a down payment on a house in another county. I decided I no longer wanted to be associated with my family, so I came out to them right before I moved away. They reacted horribly, saying I was going to rot in hell and that I was dead to them. Fine with me. I moved and we haven\u2019t spoken in years. \n\nSince I moved, I landed a great job and met the love of my life, my husband \u201cJonah\u201d (35M). However, this is where the problem arises. \n\nA month ago, I got a message from Max. He apologized for what he said when I came out and said he wanted to reconnect. But he then told me that he had lost his job and his family (his wife \u201cDani\u201d and their 2 kids) was about to be evicted, so he asked if they would be able to stay with me for a few months until they got back on their feet. He also said that he would\u2019ve asked to stay at my parents\u2019 place, but they recently moved to an assisted living facility. \n\nMy first instinct was to say no. But when I told Jonah, he said we should give them a chance because Max could\u2019ve changed and he doesn\u2019t want the kids to be homeless. I finally agreed and messaged Max that I would help him on a few conditions: \n\n1. Under no circumstances is he allowed to bring up politics or mention his political opinions. \n2. Under no circumstances is he allowed to disrespect me, my husband, or our home. \n\nI told Max that if they break the rules, he and his family would be out. Zero tolerance. He agreed, and they came to stay a few weeks ago. Jonah works from home, so I told him to tell me if Max ever said or did anything that broke the rules. \n\nFor the first few weeks, everything was fine. But a few days ago, Jonah called me crying while I was at work. He said that he told Max to clean up after his kids because they were making a mess. Max didn\u2019t want to, so that started an argument. It culminated in Max screaming that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a f*g telling him what to do.\u201d\n\nI was furious. When I got home, I told Max he and his family had 2 days to pack and get out. He started arguing with me and said Jonah was lying, but I know Jonah would never lie about something like that. When he saw I was serious, he said I was a terrible person for making his kids homeless, but I said he did this to himself. Dani then stepped in and apologized for Max (which confirms he said it) and begged me to give them another chance, but I said zero-tolerance means zero-tolerance. \n\nThey didn\u2019t start packing until I threatened to call the police. I gave them the address for a homeless shelter and they left. But they keep texting asking to come back, saying their kids are suffering. Even some of my cousins are getting involved and are saying it\u2019s cruel to punish children for their parent\u2019s mistake. AITA here?\n\nEdit: lots of people are asking why they can\u2019t just live with my cousins.

I think I did cause them some issues and I\u2019m very angry at myself sometimes.\n\nAlmost two years ago I ended a very unhappy long distance relationship - basically I stayed in it because I didn\u2019t think anyone else would want me.

If you take in his family, he will always be hovering in the background.  Put your guilt aside and put your partner\u2019s needs first.

Taking in just the kids is a fucking sticky situation that if you really want to consider OP (if you even wind up reading this) CONSULT A LAWYER FIRST. The last thing you need is them handing you their kids than coming in claiming that you abducted them or some shit. IANAL, so I don't know how well such a claim would hold up, but I wouldn't even want to invite the accusation, some parents have the birth certificates of some children and say they're both being held against their will by that person there... well... if only takes one bad cop to ruin your day...", "And treating everyone as his insubordinate\u2026", "> Her usual mo was to pick up homeless dudes and quickly fall in \u2018love.\u2019 She spent all her money on them\n\nJesus... and I thought buying too many videogames was a waste of money as an adult that I needed to reign in.

Your story upset me in a sympathy for you kind of way so I just wanted to comment on it a bit. Something you said caught my eye in particular - that you're very angry at yourself sometimes - so maybe you've heard this before but I'll just repeat it just in case.\n\nBad parents are never angry at themselves. They never blame themselves. They never look inwards and think, \"What did I do wrong?\" - they don't have that ability. I'm certain you're much more put together than I am and so I hope it doesn't come across as too patronizing for me to say as much, but I think you can afford to remind yourself to be kind to yourself whenever the introspection gets hold of you and you start feeling angry at yourself.", "Glad you are in a healthy, loving \u2764\ufe0frelationship now.

They can go live with the cousins.\n\nGood for you OP. Your husband did NOT deserve that treatment and if your brother didn\u2019t want to be homeless, he should\u2019ve showed respect.
