I\u2019m gay, so that was hard on me growing up. In my 20s, my grandpa died and left me a large chunk of inheritance. It was enough to put a down payment on a house in another county. I decided I no longer wanted to be associated with my family, so I came out to them right before I moved away. They reacted horribly, saying I was going to rot in hell and that I was dead to them. Fine with me. I moved and we haven\u2019t spoken in years. \n\nSince I moved, I landed a great job and met the love of my life, my husband \u201cJonah\u201d (35M). However, this is where the problem arises. \n\nA month ago, I got a message from Max. He apologized for what he said when I came out and said he wanted to reconnect. But he then told me that he had lost his job and his family (his wife \u201cDani\u201d and their 2 kids) was about to be evicted, so he asked if they would be able to stay with me for a few months until they got back on their feet. He also said that he would\u2019ve asked to stay at my parents\u2019 place, but they recently moved to an assisted living facility. \n\nMy first instinct was to say no. But when I told Jonah, he said we should give them a chance because Max could\u2019ve changed and he doesn\u2019t want the kids to be homeless. I finally agreed and messaged Max that I would help him on a few conditions: \n\n1. Under no circumstances is he allowed to bring up politics or mention his political opinions. \n2. Under no circumstances is he allowed to disrespect me, my husband, or our home. \n\nI told Max that if they break the rules, he and his family would be out. Zero tolerance. He agreed, and they came to stay a few weeks ago. Jonah works from home, so I told him to tell me if Max ever said or did anything that broke the rules. \n\nFor the first few weeks, everything was fine. But a few days ago, Jonah called me crying while I was at work. He said that he told Max to clean up after his kids because they were making a mess. Max didn\u2019t want to, so that started an argument. It culminated in Max screaming that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a f*g telling him what to do.\u201d\n\nI was furious. When I got home, I told Max he and his family had 2 days to pack and get out. He started arguing with me and said Jonah was lying, but I know Jonah would never lie about something like that. When he saw I was serious, he said I was a terrible person for making his kids homeless, but I said he did this to himself. Dani then stepped in and apologized for Max (which confirms he said it) and begged me to give them another chance, but I said zero-tolerance means zero-tolerance. \n\nThey didn\u2019t start packing until I threatened to call the police. I gave them the address for a homeless shelter and they left. But they keep texting asking to come back, saying their kids are suffering. Even some of my cousins are getting involved and are saying it\u2019s cruel to punish children for their parent\u2019s mistake. AITA here?\n\nEdit: lots of people are asking why they can\u2019t just live with my cousins.

Yes the guy is an asshole, yes op is not responsible for him and his family, but it is the state's responsibility to find somewhere for this family to live. \n\nToo many here are accepting homelessness as a natural consequence of personal choices and it's frankly disgusting.\n\nOh nta obv", "NO. That crap wasn't \"making fun\". Toxic hatemongers can sleep on the streets. They agreed to the terms and violated them.", "Making fun is teasing both find playful. A refusal to clean up after your family followed by shouting a slur is not that.", "Making fun? No, that asshile used a SLUR against his brother's husband. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you, sheesh....", "No, if the parents are concerned the kids are homeless then if they can ask brother/BIL to house them so the kids don't suffer.  The parents lost their housing privs when dear 'old dad opened his homophobic mouth.", "No. They were very clearly saying OP could help the kids out and give them a place to stay because it's not the kid's fault their dad finds hating gay people to be more important to him than making sure his kids have a roof over their heads. Not take them away, give them shelter until dad can find somewhere else to live, so they don't have to live in the homeless shelter with him in the meantime.", "A different, more honest way to ou that would be \u201cI\u2019m willing to put the kids up to prevent them living in a shelter\u201d.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not about the word. It\u2019s about the deep\nDisrespect that goes with it.", "yeah... you are being far to technical for me,lol.\n\nThe brother is supream ass,... op could have maybe handled it better for the sake of his nephews."]}
