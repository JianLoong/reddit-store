I got pregnant quickly and we had a daughter together (Maia15)\n\nI always felt that he favored Ada. When Ada was born he fought very hard to get custody and when he got primary custody (Ada's mom could only see her every other weekend) I thought he would be happy but he was sad!!!! He didn't want to let Ada go to her mom's home even for 4 days a month. I thought this is all really nice and I was glad that he was such a good dad.\n\nHowever, we decided to break up when Maia was 5. We went to court and though he did fight for custody he didn't fight as hard and I got primary custody and he got every weekend. I thought he'd be sad but he seemed happy with this arrangement. Now don't get me wrong I'm glad to have primary custody but I found it weird that he was happy with this situation, I asked why he is happy and he said he thinks this is the best thing to do for Maia.\n\nThis was just one example.\n\nNow I feel like he is treating them differently again. Ada is constantly posting pictures of her and my ex. They are always doing something together (which I find weird because teenagers usually don't want to spend time with their parents) If Maia asks to go with them they take her and sometimes they invite Maia as well but most of the time it's just the 2 of them.\n\nA few nights ago I finally snapped. After seeing another picture of them going ice skating together without taking Maia I called him and told him if he can remember having 2 kids. He asked what my problem is and I told him my problem is that he is an awful dad. He called me an asshole and said Maia isn't interested in ice skating. I told him then he needs to do something that she is interested in instead of excluding her from everything. He thinks I'm over reacting but I think he is showing favoritism so AITA?", "created_utc": 1674147594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g6u5p/aita_for_calling_my_ex_an_awful_dad/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why are you inserting yourself into his relationship with Ada? Mind your damn business.", "YTA.\n\nHe clearly had a reason to fight for primary custody for Ada and it seems that he feels that Maia is in good hands with you being the primary parent and that he can have a good co-parenting relationship with you. \n\nBut the reality is, Maia is going to miss out on some stuff if you have primary custody. Ada is there all the time and your ex is her only parent, it makes sense that there is a closeness there. \n\nIf you want to arrange a custody situation where Maia can go to her dad's whenever she wants, then open up that discussion. But don't call him a bad dad when the girls are in different situations and therefore have different relationships with their dad.", "YTA there\u2019s no evidence here that he\u2019s an awful dad. It sounds like you\u2019re mostly jealous of the fact that he\u2019s closer to his other daughter than to yours (and you\u2019re also the one who chose to have a baby with a man who had just recently impregnated another woman).", "YTA.  Your daughter didn\u2019t want to go ice skating, how is that her dad\u2019s fault?\n\nYou\u2019re awful for suggesting something untoward because Ada spends time with her dad.\n\nAnd YTA for saying that he\u2019s an awful dad, when it seems like he\u2019s a great dad.", "YTA. He's not showing favoritism. Of course he spends more time with the kid he has primary custody of. They still invite Maia along. You sound like you're projecting.", "YTA, so he can't take one daughter ice skating because the other doesn't like it?? He has the other daughter a majority of the time so of course he's going to end up doing more with her. \n\nYou should consider it a compliment that he feels his daughter is safe a better having you as her mother in her life. The other mother must be a mess if they awarded him primary custody. Sounds like he was just doing his best for each daughter.", "He see's Ada 20 days/mo and Maia only 8 on average? So statistically yes, they are going to spend more time together. He is allowed to spend time with Ada, without Maia. \n\nTo me, it sounds like your jealously is what likely crumbled this whole relationship. That's just my opinion. I'm going to say YTA. Because without his side, I can't be sure that he's intentionally showering one more than the other, or purposefully excluding Maia.", "YTA your the reason he can\u2019t take his daughters out every time maybe if you care that much why not give the guy more than 27% of his daughters time", "If Maia asks, they include her, if she doesn't she will be invited at times. \n\nFrankly, your post reads of envy, that he did not insist on primary custody, that he has more fun with his full time daughter than you do with yours. \n\nSo, YTA", "YTA \n\nIf you want him to have more time with her for activities then revisit the custody agreement. \n\nAlso acknowledge that just because Ada wants to do things with him doesn\u2019t mean Maia does, they\u2019re two different kids don\u2019t treat them as though they\u2019d both react/act the same. \n\nIt sounds like you might be uneasy about your own time spent with her/what you make time for so you\u2019re hoping he is filling the gap for you somehow when he has time with her.", "YTA. Are you expecting him to pick up Maia to take her on outings during your time with her? You have primary custody, so he obviously sees her less and Ada more.", "YTA his other daughter lives with him full time, obviously they spend more time together. You didn\u2019t mention a single issue that your daughter actually had, or that she ever expressed feeling left out, this is just all about you. He sounds like a pretty great dad and you sound jealous as hell", "You say he's \u00e0 good dad, and yet, you fought him for full custody instead of doing 50/50.\n\nYou don't even get your kid on week-ends so what fun activities so you do with her ?\n\nYTA.", "Eh I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. First, you admit he fought for custody but you are upset because he didn\u2019t fight hard enough? Then you proceed to say it\u2019s weird that Ada wants to hang out with her dad because she\u2019s a teenager. But then in the next sentence express how he\u2019s a terrible father for not inviting Mai on every single outing he has with Ada. \n\nI think the big question is whether Maia feels the same way. Or if it\u2019s only you who has a problem with it.", "YTA\n\nEven all your replies are asshole comments. You just want someone to feel sorry for you. \n\nYour daughter is 15, my 14 year old MALE child definitely voices what bothers him. So Im sure if your daughter had a problem, she would say something. \n\nAlso, He has Ada 100% of the time. He has Maia every weekend, so 8 days a month. He has a lot more time with Ada than Maia, but you know this.\n\nAlso, you said he was a good dad but you still fought for full custody of Maia. Was that out of spite? And, maybe Ada's mom wasn't in the mental capacity to be a fulltime mother and he knew that, and still knows that, so that's why he over compensates for Ada. But He feels Maia has a great mom in you so he doesn't have to overcompensate.\n\nHe shouldn't have to take Maia on every outing him and Ada do. That's just unreasonable unless has Maia 100% of the time like he has Ada. If that was the case and he left her out then, that would be a major problem.", "INFO: How many posts go up on social media where it's just you and Maia doing something that your ex and Ada weren't invited to?\n\nYou have primary custody of Maia. He has custody of Ada. He sees Ada a lot more, so he's going to do a lot more with her. If you want your ex to do more with Maia maybe you should renegotiate the custody arrangement so he has her more often than 4 days a month.", "I think you are definitely overreacting. He does not seem to be a bad father at all, and he is involved with both of his kids. You have primary custody of Maia, you can do those things with her. He is going to do more things with the kid he has full custody of. I think you are asking too much of him.", "YTA. Assumptions and internet stalking his 16 year old daughter. That's what you're working with here. Stop. It's embarrassing for you and damaging to your co parenting dynamic.\n\nTalk to Maia. Ask her if she feels neglected by anyone in her family. Ask her what new interests she may have. Propose a few ideas to your ex. If your primary concern really is Maia, you would be far more tactful in your communication with her dad. Instead, you jumped straight to accusations. Do better for Maia.", "Can you just reframe this as\n\nHe sees you as a good mother and trusts you with more custody? Maybe A's mother isn't as involved or mentally healthy. Maybe he tried more with her because he felt like he needed to.\n\nI don't know much about parenting and co-parenting and blended families. But if everyone is OK with the situation it doesn't need to devolve into drama.", "INFO: How does Maia feel? Also - is it possible he fought harder for his first child because her mom was unfit?", "YTA.\n\nGiven how hard he fought and the fact that it is much more difficult for fathers to get primary custody of their children, there was obviously some serious safety and welfare concerns that were an issue in his case with his other ex.\n\nWhy did you fight for primary custody if you thought he was, by your own admission, a good dad. The courts generally default to 50/50 custody, so unless dad asked for less time, I would assume you made a case to the court that he was unfit to have more than just the weekends.\n\nOverall, I think its telling that you attacked him based upon your anger and feelings over social media posts that you saw, and then you dismissed his concerns when he explained his actions based upon the wants, needs and interests of Maia, herself.", "You sued for primary custody, got primary custody, and now you\u2019re annoyed that your ex spends less time with your daughter than with the daughter who is in his full custody.  How is he meant to spend equal time with his daughters when, per court order, he does not have them for equal amounts of time? \n\nHonestly, it sounds like you think that fighting with an ex over time with a child is how one shows love for that child.  I see where you\u2019re coming from, but that is the least healthy, least supportive way a divorced parent could show affection.  \n\nI\u2019m also curious, if you were together until Ada was 6 - how much time do you spend with Ada?  How much effort do you put into giving the sisters time together despite their conflicting custody schedules?", "Based on what is written, and if what he said is true, I am inclined to say YTA - but it could also require more information because this is not usually something that is determined in short order.\n\nHe may have fought so hard for his other daughter, because he didn't think mom was a capable parent.  Mothers don't usually have much trouble getting good custody terms, so there may be something too that.  He may not have fought you as much, because he isn't as worried about you as a parent.  If that is the case, that would make him a pretty good dad all the way around.\n\nI don't see a problem with you questioning what he is or isn't doing with your daughter, but calling someone a bad mom or dad is pretty strong language.", "This comment section ain\u2019t it\u2026", "YTA. He's got nearly full custody of his oldest child,  of course they're going to do things without the younger child who he has only on weekends. \n\nI suspect he fought really hard for the first kid then 5 years later when you split he knew what he was getting in to and what his limits were and he's probably right that she's better off with you having primary custody if she's your only child. \n\nIt honestly sounds like you're the only person bothered by this situation that doesn't really have anything to do with you. \n\nBad on your post he sounds like a good dad and you sound jealous on behalf of your daughter.", "INFO: Does he truly do more with the daughter that lives with him? It might be helpful to make a list to get some perspective. Maybe you are reading too much into the situation. He naturally will do more with the child that lives with him. However, he does need to make an effort to do things alone with your daughter for sure. Has your daughter ever voiced feeling left out?", "YTA, he\u2019s not an awful dad. Unfortunately Ada lives with him so obviously they\u2019re going to do more together. He only has your daughter 8 days a month. If you really want her to be included more go back to court and redo the custody order to give him more time.", "ESH - YOU: If you were noticing a pattern and as you say in comments do great co-parenting; why haven't you sat down and discussed this with him in full vs. just calling him a bad dad?  Explain it ALL, including how you witnessed him fighting for Ada, etc? HIM: Seems like maybe he does have a bit of a different outlook between the two which isn't right, and even if he has maia less time, seems he would put even more effort into bonding...   Then again, the orig custody battle for Ada was a long time ago --  maybe you are remembering things thru a different lens and this issue is more about jealousy on your part...", "YTA. I don't see anything wrong with what your ex is doing. \n\n>When Ada was born he fought very hard to get custody and when he got primary custody (Ada's mom could only see her every other weekend) I thought he would be happy but he was sad!!!! He didn't want to let Ada go to her mom's home even for 4 days a month.\n\nSounds like he was concerned about Ada being alone with her mother or Ada was concerned about being with her mother.\n\n>We went to court and though he did fight for custody he didn't fight as hard and I got primary custody and he got every weekend. I thought he'd be sad but he seemed happy with this arrangement.\n\nSounds like he is not worried about your daughter living with you the way he was worried about Ada's mother.\n\n>If Maia asks to go with them they take her and sometimes they invite Maia as well but most of the time it's just the 2 of them.\n\nSo Maia isn't being excluded. She's invited and she's able to ask if she wants to go. Ada and your ex live together soon by default they will see each other more than Maia sees them.\n\n>He called me an asshole and said Maia isn't interested in ice skating.\n\nIs Maia interested in ice skating? It seems like you're the only one with a problem.", "YTA\n\nFirst things first. It seems to me that you created the situation by opposing him having primary custody, and are now blaming him for a situation that would not have occurred but for him not winning primary custody. If you want him to do more activities with Maia, the solution is simple: change the custody agreement, and get Maia to agree with you.\n\n\"He thinks I'm over reacting but I think he is showing favoritism\"\n\nHe is. So say it! That's not the same as being an awful dad. Don't accuse people of the wrong crime especially when it's worse than what they're actually doing. Has Maia noticed? Has she complained? Does she feel sad? Does her father fail to make time for her?", "Edited: YTA.  In terms of custody, maybe he thinks you're a good mom and his previous ex isn't.  If he has primary custody of Ada, he's going to do more things with her.  Maybe he should be doing more with Maia, but I'm not seeing evidence that he's an awful dad, so that was a little harsh.  Edit: after reading your comments, that was a lot harsh, and you're being unreasonable.  Does he have Maia during some of the times Ada is with her mom?  Maybe he could spend some time alone with Maia to do something she specifically likes.  But fundamentally, Ada is his full-time child, and he's going to favor her.  Maia is your full-time child, and you should be the one giving her that same kind of energy.", "NTA, but maybe you could have talked to Maia first and see how she feels. What if she is simply one of those teenagers who isn't interested with spending time with her dad? Also, we don't know what's going on with Ada and her mom behind closed doors, what if your ex was trying to compensate for something? I'm sure this is something you can all talk about nicely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
