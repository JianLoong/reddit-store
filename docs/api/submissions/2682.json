I'm not doing great with socializing right now but for my kids I do try. But I have one friend who's little 3 year old boy asks me every time I see him if my son is still dead. I always get down on his level and gently say \"yes he is.\" Then her son starts the questions. \"Do you miss him?\" \"Are you sad?\" 'Why did he die?\" \"Where is he buried?\" Then he's fine and gets on with the day. They are innocent questions and I know this, but it takes all the energy I put into socializing just to answer. So lately I've been avoiding her. She noticed and asked why and I explained as nicely as possible that those questions are small to her but not to me. So now she's upset because she said \"eventually he'll stop if he sees you more\" but now with Thanksgiving, then Christmas I just can't. I'm not trying to blame a child and I'm not mad at anyone. I could go more and just suck it up because I love my friend and her kids and so do my kids. But it just seems like it's easier right now to avoid the situation. My friend is a single mom so I know she relies on me to help her out sometimes and give her a much needed break. So AITA?\nEdit because I forgot to add, my whole family is in therapy so that's already happening. And I'm not posting to get sympathy, this is genuinely troubling my conscience because she truly does love and want to support us\nEdit 2 just to clarify, she's usually out of the room when he does this. She has 7 kids so she leaves the door unlocked so I can let myself in since she's usually in the middle of something.\n\n\n\n\nOne more edit, sorry!: thank you everyone for your wonderful condolences and support. I do want to clarify that when this happened my friend hired a babysitter for her kids so she could come be with me during the day and she hired one for the viewing so she could say goodbye to him too but also support my husband and I and she then took my kids after they had said goodbye and took them to get ice cream and go to the park so both my husband and I could stay longer to be with him one last time. Her getting upset about this is completely out of character for her so I'm chalking it up to her having her own stresses and grief. She was the first one to meet him as a baby after we did and she's always adored him and I know she's struggling with it too.", "created_utc": 1668807420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyvaw0/aita_for_avoiding_my_friend_because_of_her_child/", "score": 274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't understand why she doesn't think she can tell her son it *does* make you sad, and it hurts you to ask about it. I don't expect a 3 year old to retain it well, but she should absolutely be making an effort to curb it!\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. At first I thought NAH but it seems your friend isn't even trying to teach her son that it is not appropriate to ask this over and over. Instead you should just deal with it.", "NTA.  You are right it isn't the child's fault, but it is hurtful to you and your mental wellbeing.  In addition, his mom should redirect the child and talk about how it may hurt to answer things like that vs allowing it to happen each time.  I'm so very sorry for your loss.  It is ok to protect your mental health.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, I am so sorry for your loss. Second, your friend needs to be stepping in during this line of questioning. Or before they even meet with you. And your friend needs to understand that \"eventually\" isn't helping you NOW while you're still grieving. You help her, she needs to help you.", "You ARE NTA at all!!! No one can imagine what that feels like, to have to explain that every time you see him.  It is NOT the child's fault, but I do feel that the Mother, even though the child is 3, could explain to him that he shouldn't ask you those questions. I mean a 3 year old can understand \"don't do that again.\" She doesn't know that he'll stop on his own either, no matter how much he sees you.\n\nYou are NTA but she is being a bit of one, at least I think she is not being a very good friend. She \"needs a break,\" give ME a break here.\n\nDo what feels best to you. If she can't control her child, that is her problem.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. Would've been N A H until her reaction.\n\nNow that she knows in no uncertain terms why it hurts and is hard, it is her job to take on that burden for you.Yes, he will stop asking in time, but she's the one to field the questions beforehand. \n\nExample: day of hangout, prior to your arrival- she shows kiddo a picture of you. Asks if he remembers you. Then gently explains, \"do you remember asking about her son? He is still gone. He won't come back. Etc. Etc. Please do not ask her about him, because her heart is still so sad about it. You can ask me though\"", "NTA - I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.  \n\nAt the age of 3, he's having a hard time understanding about death, and it seems to me that his mother should be priming him with some of this to help cut down on the questions.  Especially after you've talked about it.  \n\nYou take all the time you need to grieve and to get through the holidays.  \n\nBest wishes, prayers, and hugs. \ud83d\udc97", "NTA. \n\nThe thing is, children often don't realize that their questions can be hurtful or upsetting, and don't have the necessary filters to navigate making sense of the world. This 3 year old is trying to understand the concept of death, and from his standpoint he needs more information. However, this is information his mother and father should be giving him rather than relying on someone grieving. There are tons of books for toddlers that discuss death and losing a loved one, and it would be a good investment for the parents. That said, because he doesn't understand, he is probably going to open wounds, and you need to do what's best for your mental health. \n\nYour friend shouldn't be downplaying your suffering and should be taking steps to fix the issue rather than acting like it's something you need to do.", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss. I cannot even imagine the pain you are going through. Do whatever you need to do to keep your sanity & mental health. No parent should burry their child. EVER.", "NTA. \nCan you talk to him? Tell the little boy that your heart is broken, and that when you see him and his mom- you want to talk about other stuff that makes you happy and cheerful? And that his mom can answer those questions for now? He\u2019s small, but he needs to learn how to navigate in an adult world with real adult feelings, and that\u2019s not easy for him (as I\u2019m sure you know from having kids), and so you and his mom maybe the ones he feels like he can ask and talk to. Because he has never felt his heart break like you, and he doesn\u2019t know grief and sorrow like you, so he sees you as someone that can tell him, and help him navigate all of those thoughts and questions. \nSending my love \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. But you are clearly NTA here. Your mental wellbeing is the most important thing in this situation. If your friend can\u2019t understand this then I am sorry to say this but that\u2019s not a true friend. She should be there for you and accommodate you and help you through the hardest part of your life and not making it harder. You should not feel bad about avoiding her and her child. You have to focus on healing and getting through this. For you but also for your children.", "Absolutely NTA good lord she needs to step up as a parent and explain to her child why asking those questions can be insensitive or hurtful, and to refrain from asking them every time he sees you. She could even make a game plan where if the kiddo is around you and feels the urge to ask, he goes to his mom and asks for a bag of chips or something. Absolutely NTA she needs to start parenting her kid. And I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I wish you the best and I\u2019m sending love and healing energy your way \ud83d\udc96", "NTA. \n\nYou lost a child, you are at the center of grieving that loss and no one around you gets to prioritize their needs or feelings about it, including a child. You aren't being rude or cruel, you just can't handle those interactions right now, and that is totally fine. It isn't up to you to make HER child feel better and eventually stop, you take care of yourself and she can handle her own child. \n\nHere is what I need you to hear. If I was that friend, I would first notice those questions and interject so you didn't have to answer them. If I didn't notice and you told me- in the very nicest way that you did in your post- I would immediately tell you that I am sorry I didn't notice, and I totally understand that you need space AND I will also talk to my kid so hopefully it stops, and if it doesn't stop, I will handle it. The whole conversation doesn't have to be mean or rude or uncomfortable, because it is about helping people who are grieving and no one is doing anything wrong, things just need to be different. And that is okay!\n\nAnd I can't help but point out that all the reasons you feel bad are about how she needs help and relies on you. There is nothing about how she has been a great friend, nothing about what she is willing to do for you, just that HER life is easier when you repress your feelings and suck it up. \n\nPlease take the time you need to grieve, and you are doing nothing wrong by wanting to avoid some painful reminders/convos right now. It is okay to put yourself first sometimes, and this barely even counts as that.", "NTA. I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss. If your friend\u2019s son is old enough to know how to ask those questions, he\u2019s old enough to be taught to NOT ask them anymore. Your friend sucks for not putting a stop to it.\n\nAnd with you mentioning that she needs help, you really don\u2019t have to be a doormat to her needs at the expense of your mental health. SHE should damn near be tending to YOU during this time, she should be worried about YOUR wellbeing, not the other way around.", "NTA. If your friend doesn't understand where you're coming from then tell her -one- of you is going to have the \"one day, grandma will be dead forever\" talk with the kid.", "Nta I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending hugs.", "NTA - it's okay to not put yourself in a situation where you know that pain is gonna get brought up again and again. And it's not like you're pointing fingers or lashing out at the kid, so I don't see what your friend's deal is. As a parent herself, she's gotta realize how incredibly painful it must be, even if her kid is just asking questions like kids do.\nI'm so sorry for your loss, my heart goes out to you and your family <3", "NTA\n\nYour Guilt, while understandable, is completely unnecessary. I cannot fathom how difficult this has been for your family, especially you. As someone else mentioned, no parent should ever have to bury a child. I am glad to hear you and your family are taking steps towards healing through therapy.\n\nThere is nothing stopping you from circling back with that friend once her child is old enough to be more sensitive with their questions.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry to hear of your loss.  It is completely appropriate to do whatever you need to do to protect yourself and your health right now, especially as you are a parent and your kids need you.  \n\nYour friend should be stepping up here.  The questions are natural and innocent, but she should talk to her kid about not asking them.  She can sit her son down before you come over, answer all his questions so you don't have to, and get him to understand why he should ask *her* the questions he has and not you.  \n\nAs a single mom of 7 kids, I get why she relies on other people a lot, but she still needs to parent her kids and she still needs to understand that right now, you may not be able to support her like you used to.  If she needs additional support to give her a break, she may need to reach out to other people.", "NTA\n\nYour mental health and your children come before your single friend and her children.", "NTA. Children don't understand, and he's trying, but. That doesn't mean you should be constantly subjected to dealing with it. She needs to be making effort to walk him through it and having conversations about not asking things like this - especially constantly.", "NTA she needs to explain to her son what death means and that if he has questions he can ask her instead. Maybe you can offer to take her other kids to the park or something so she can have a conversation with him about it without distractions?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss <3", "NTA and I don't see why she can't have a talk with her son about this and get him to stop.", "Nta !!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f you need to safeguard your broken heart. I'm so very sorry!", "NAH.   You understand that he's an innocent child and that he doesn't understand.    I'm so sorry for your loss.  I know nothing can make it better but this internet stranger is sending thoughts and hugs your way.", "NTA your friend is seriously lacking on empathy and isn\u2019t even attempting to teach her son boundaries. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nHow awful for everyone.", "ESH.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss, but clearly this is impacting your relationship with your friend. Have either you, or she, tried sitting down with this kid and explaining that he shouldn't ask questions like this?\n\nClearly this kid needs a little more discipline, and his mom should have stepped up and talked to him about those being inappropriate questions. If she won't, then surely you could explain it to the kid, and hopefully be able to maintain the relationship?", "NAH. Of course that's going to be hard for you to be around, no guilt required and I think your friend is just trying to be supportive and keep you in her life, doesn't sound like she's demeaning what your feeling just that she's trying to reassure you that it will get better. Of course, I don't know the tone she used or the conversation you had but that's what I gather from what you've said. Has she had a talk with him? Explain death and grief and how it can be a bit intrusive asking all those questions? Is there a way you could just help her out with some of the kids and maybe avoid that one? Just doesn't seem like a good time for you to lose a close friend, even if it is temporary. I truly hope you manage to find a resolution, so you can continue your friendship without any unnecessary anguish xx", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Right now you and your family are the ones who should be receiving support. Period. End of story. \n\nI\u2019m seriously side eyeing your friend if she\u2019s prioritizing some free babysitting over what you\u2019re going through. Even if you just had a hard time being around other children that would be completely valid. I am going to be blunt: she\u2019s not a good person is she\u2019s pushing you past your comfort so you can help her. In fact, that makes her a pretty big jerk. Stay away from her through the holidays\u2014and maybe afterwards too\u2026", "NTA. I'm so very, very sorry for your loss.\n\nIt's good that you're not angry at the child, but his mom really needs to step up a bit there. She needs to sit with him and explain to him why those questions are painful to you. She needs to be the one to tell him to stop his behavior. You sucking it up and waiting for him to forget to ask isn't the solution here.", "NTA. You need to protect your mental health, especially so you can be there for your kids who also lost a sibling. Little kids ask questions like that for sure, but your friend could work with their kiddo on it. You are absolutely NTA for protecting yourself right now though.", "NTA.\n\nLook, she was a good friend, and still is, but you only have so much emotional bandwidth. Explain to her that you are on 1/16 with the gas tank. Her son's innocent questions, very innocent, puts you on E. Everything after that, in your life, cannot be addressed. Your little emotional car is stopped in the road until something, someone, sleep, etc puts enough in your tank to move.\n\nYou need to focus on doing everything else with that 1/16 tank until it fills more & you're asking her for grace enough to find that extra capacity without having her sweet, curious son draining it all with his questions.", "They won't be able to understand the permanence but it can be retained that these questions upset someone and learn to stop - especially with continued guidance and gentle nudges.", "Right? Just remind the kid before she shows up - remember what we talked about, honey? Friend is still really sad about her little boy dying, so let\u2019s not ask about it today, ok?", "This.", "Right? When our cat passed and my kids started asking those questions we sat them down and explained grieving and how it can hurt some people. They didn\u2019t ask the questions again.", "I agree. OP's friend has to step it up and teach her son better, 3 is old enough to learn that\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, OP!!", "That's a good idea. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking because I know his heart hurts, my son was his buddy and was always so patient with him, letting him follow him around and when we went places he would take him and do fun things since he was older and the little guy just adored him. The 3 year old is the only boy so he would emulate him and I know he misses him a lot.", "You're right, I never know what's appropriate as far as explaining it to him so I didn't want to step on her toes or say something that would upset him too much. He looked up to my son a lot and my son always took time to spend with him and entertain him. Not that I expected it, he's been there since the little one was a baby so I just didn't want to make my struggles the little boys in any way.", "I can't avoid him because he always waits by the door hoping this time I'm bringing my son so avoiding probably isn't possible. She brought him to the burial so I know they talked some before that.

How do you expect them to learn?? \n\nKids can internalise surprisingly complex concepts; they just don't fully grasp them until later.", "As a mom of two, I have never experienced what you have. But I lost my dad, and had to sit my boy down and talk to him about life and death, my heart breaking and why I cry when AC/DC is playing in the car. Took some talking and time, but he got it. I think kids do, they are really great like that, they just need to learn a whole new life skill, and tools to deal with it. As adults we learn and understand as we age, his learning just came too early and he has no ways of grasping the concept of life and death (me neither to be honest but I try). Best of luck, hope you and mom can keep the good friendship, and boy and you can find a good solution to talk and not talk about your son when you meet.", "It is not your job to explain this to the child.

I think this situation hits close to home in a strange way for me - because I was this child. It's my first memory. I still feel super super bad over it, because I made my mom cry. That said I was walked through it and I didn't bring it up again - I was also the same age as this boy. Like. No.. it can be done, and it's not fair to put op thru this trauma just because you don't want to teach your child.", "I'm sorry that happened to you. That's what I want to avoid is him feeling bad later or thinking he hurt me when it's done in innocence.", "Aw, poor baby you. It's hard learning to be a person! I'm glad your parents were good (it sounds like) about it.", "Which is definitely a possibility. Children are sensitive. Teaching him is in both you and the child's best interest. It's not fair to you to have to go through that over and over- and it's not fair to him if this is something he remembers - because even when you hurt someone on accident there's still guilt there for a lot of people. For his mom to not even try to negate the issue in the first place really upsets me.", "NTA, her reaction is not ok.  The correct thing for her to do would have been to talk to her son and try to resolve the issue.  It might not be easy as a 3yo won't understand, but she needs to put in that effort instead of just dismissing you as 'it'll stop eventually'.", "NTA. You have had one of the most horrific things in the world happen to you. Grief is different for everyone, your way is the right way, no matter what you have to do to get through it. As you mentioned, your friend is also grieving. She needs to process it in her way, and respect your right to process it in your own way. I am so, so very sorry for your loss. Love and healing light to you and your family.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9c", "I wonder if the friend could 'prepare' her kid, like 'hey, OP's son is still dead, she misses him so so much, so it would be nice of us if we didn't talk to her about it today because it makes her really sad'.\n\nGet all of the questions he wants to ask out of the way before he gets to the meetup.", "Definitely! She doesn't appear to want to though - and having to try and convince her is a lot of emotional labour on OP's part.", "Indeed. I was thinking, probably rather optimistically that perhaps the friend just hasn't thought of it as an approach to addressing the situation? \n\nI mean seven kids is a bit to keep track of, and by OPs account she has otherwise been a good and supportive friend.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sure your friend is embarrassed and as you know the child isn\u2019t trying to be mean, but you have every right to give yourself space and your friend should do her best to take care of this away from you. She should explain the situation and teach him what that means and why we need to be gentle. \n\nI was pregnant and lost our baby 2nd trimester. I had to explain to our 4 year old the baby had died and for weeks she would ask about the baby, point to my belly and say the baby is gone? Baby not there anymore? It was absolutely brutal. I couldn\u2019t escape my own kids questions but man if I could have I would have. So, no\u2026 NTA. Make the space for yourself that you need. \n\nAgain.. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. She is the one who should be trying to teach her son some basic empathy. Like he's three, he doesn't understand the permanence of these questions, but she should, and asking him to stop because it hurts you.\n\nThe problem here is you're not blaming the child, you're blaming the parenting, and you are right to, and instead of actually addressing the problem she's just getting angry at you.", "I'm going to go with NAH. I lost my baby girl when she was 6 weeks old, and I'm very sorry for your loss. Because she was a twin, and her father had a huge, very close family, it was very difficult to find that balance of being able to socialize, but still finding the strength not to fall apart because there was another little one who needed me, and many cousins were very young and asked lots of questions. Friends and family try their best to be supportive, but there's truly no way for them to completely understand when they haven't experienced the loss of a child.\n\nI will tell you I was a horrible emotional mess for at least a year, barely holding it together, and my heart goes out to you. But it does get less hard with time. Do what you need to for your own emotional well-being. It did help me a lot to raise my daughter (her twin) with the knowledge from a very young age that her sister was in heaven. I truly wish the best for you and your family in these tough times with holidays coming up.", "She's a single mom with apparently 7 kids, so she's probably otherwise occupied. \ud83d\ude10", "Yeah each of those kids is getting like 1/7 the amount of parenting an only child gets. That's messed up.", "You are NTA, NEVER TA, and I am so sad for your loss.\n\nWe all feel and handle grief differently. Three is hard to understand the significance of death. I don't think you would be out of bounds to ask your friend to explain to her kid that those questions make you sad. Kids don't necessarily understand death,  but they understand sadness.\n\nOr you can explain the questions make you sad, and ask the kid to stop asking them yourself? I don't know the rules of kids or other people's kids.\n\nBut if neither of those is an option, and avoiding them is the only way to keep your heart from breaking into a thousand more pieces with every question, you do what you need to do.", "NTA. But I'm wondering, if there's a way that all three of you can sit down and talk about your kid, and their life, and remember them in a way that helps all three of you process it. Maybe you can suggest your friend show the Mr Rogers episode on death? Or if it's available somewhere, the episode where Mr Hooper dies on Sesame Street? It might help frame it in a way that he can process it easier. Death is hard at any age, and with any person (or animal, I am currently grieving one of my animals), and having a good support system is really important in facilitating that. I think the three year old just doesn't understand that death means you don't come back. Which is why I think the episodes I mentioned might be helpful. I think there was a Reading Rainbow episode too. I'm sorry you're going through this. Sending you love \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA grief is hard.\n\nI learned really early on, I have to take the most action to look after myself, because I can do it best.\nIt's not forever, and it's not that you don't care, it's just that at the one point in your life, going through what you are, you need to look after you first.\nGrief isn't always pretty. I hope she will stand by you and see it for what it is - just a hurting mum.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, you are allowed to get space for your mental health after an extremely traumatic event.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "My BFF just lost her father & her 4 yr old nephew has had a horrible time (they were very close). I ordered him several childrens books that on dying/heaven for his mom to read to him from Amazon for under $15 bucks (even less or free if have kindle). It\u2019s helped him a lot and this maybe an option for OP\u2019s friend. My \u2764\ufe0f goes out to OP & her family & friends for their loss.", "Oh my: this was brand new when I commented. That is... a lot.", "> Yeah, it's my pet peeves when parents say \"they don't/won't know\" as a reason to... not teach them? How do you expect them to learn?? \n\nOmfg, same. So many parents seem to think that these are innate things that their kids will eventually grow into, instead of life lessons that you have to teach them.", "Would be nice if that was the case! The 7 kids edit wasn't up when I posted - I can't even fathom how she's standing, wow.\n\nHonestly, needing space and not having the wherewithal to deal with any of this is such a fair response. Hopefully OP's friend was having an emotional reaction she'll rethink. :/", "NTA. Twenty years ago , I lost my brother to cancer. While I did not begrudge any advances in cancer treatment, for years I was unable to celebrate advances in cancer treatment. \n\nWow! This makes me sound like a sh**. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that while I was glad that there were further advances in cancer treatment, I couldn\u2019t really celebrate them because they didn\u2019t save my brother. I also was glad that they saved others, but was not as glad as if my brother had been saved. \n\nEmotions are complicated. While I wanted no other person harmed, I took no joy in others who lived when my brother died. I didn\u2019t wish them death, but did actually have any feelings towards the others.", "NTA. Your friend should be speaking to her son regularly, like each time they see you about it, reminding him and telling him what is right and wrong here.\n\n\"So we are going to see OP, she is still very sad about Son, so we are going to give her a big hug but not ask her any questions\" \n\nThat would give him the opportunity to a) ask his questions to her instead of you and b) give her a prompt to give him ('remember what we talked about?) If he does start asking. She should also be jumping in and pulling him away if he starts up.", "NTA your friend is being very insensitive, asking you to go through that until her son eventually stops. I'm sorry you're going through that.", "Absolutely! OP right now your needs are the most important in your relationship with your friend.  Her needs and the needs of her child are much lower priority. And it doesn't matter that she was supportive to you before - you don't have to pay her back in support now; you still need support, and if she can't give you support she needs to at the very least prevent her child from sucking up what little energy you have.", "My aunt use to be HUGE it only took one scolding after I asked if she\u2019s pregnant in early elementary school, and an explanation on why it\u2019s upsetting and I stopped. \n\nNow I have full on ADHD, anyone secret is safe with me because I will literally forget it instantly, but I understand what was wrong and never made the mistake again.", "If he pets a puppy too rough, someone corrects him to be gentle because he is hurting the puppy. The same correction can be made about his words in a developmentally appropriate way. It's important he learn early that words can hurt and to be gentle regardless of innocent intent.", "NTA. There will come a time when you can cope better, but not yet. Your friend needs to talk to her son about this. He may only be three but he's  old enough to understand that your \"feelings are hurt\" by his questions, and to stop asking.", "NTA nor is the 3 yr old cause well he's 3 and don't quite understand. Your friend is an asshole though. You voiced to her how you felt and she should be the one curbing it.", "NTA and my condolences. The holidays are very tough for those who have buried a child or spouse especially the 1st holiday season without them. Her son, while totally innocent, is triggering a difficult and negative reaction emotionally for you. Again he's not doing so in a malicious manner but it is having a negative impact on you currently. Putting some distance between them temporarily is best for your emotional wellbeing.", "Agreed, definitely NTA. Also, you don\u2019t have to \u2018suck it up\u2019 at all OP, and it would be unreasonable, unfair and cruel to expect you to. At first I thought she was just upset that she wasn\u2019t seeing you, but with the rest I get the feeling she\u2019s more upset at the loss of help with her kids (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t the case). To be frank, although she may have relied on your support as a single mom before, she needs to understand that things can\u2019t just stay the same because she needs them to. Right now you\u2019re the one who must be given a \u2018much needed break\u2019. Take care of yourself and you family for now OP", "My nephew isn\u2019t even 3 yet (two months to go). We thought we had to escalate our reactions to him making a mess so he\u2019d understand that, while it wasn\u2019t terrible, we\u2019d shown him ways to avoid it many times before. We had him clean it up (with help ofc) He didn\u2019t seem fussed over it, put up a fight over cleaning it. Ff to next week, he got overly concerned with cleaning up a mess and we realised he had just taken a lot of time to process what we\u2019d said before. Learnt to actually dial back how we dealt with situations and give him time to take things in. Toddlers are much more capable than we give them credit for", "It\u2019s ok for him to feel a little bad for hurting you. Obviously you wouldn\u2019t want him beating himself up about it, especially at that age, but it\u2019s also important for him to learn that sometimes we hurt people the most when we don\u2019t mean to. Maybe you can both sit with him and say that it\u2019s great that he\u2019s curious and wants to ask questions about how people are feeling. But because it makes you very sad sometimes, maybe you can have a special sign that you be an use when you want to talk about him that only the two of you use. Or a special day for that."]}
