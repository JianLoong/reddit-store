It\u2019s interesting, but at this point, I feel like people in NY specifically have a sense of what Holi is about.  There are plenty of Holi celebrations in public parks, and while they try to appropriate it by calling it \u201ccolour runs\u201d or \u201ccolour parties\u201d, New Yorkers are decently exposed to the concept.  Plus, you told him before you left, so even at that point he had a chance to change his clothes.  Query also whether both the host and your other friend explained this to him. \n\nJoe is a guest in a foreign country and went to a huge cultural celebration - he should be not just respecting these rituals but enjoying them (my family is South Indian, but I am dying to celebrate Holi in north India some day - it looks like so much fund (as opposed to celebrating it in NY at just about freezing temperatures)). I also don\u2019t think there was a need to defend - these kids were having fun and doing something totally normal during Holi - did Joe expect that he would have some VIP area to completely protect him from the colours? You did the right thing and handled the situation properly.  And Joe deserves this for making fun of you not being dressed \u201cappropriately\u201d - shocking that the American got the Indian customs so wrong /s.  Fitting that Joe found out, in India no less, that karma really is a bitch. \n\nIf Joe wants to make the most out of India, he has to realise that countries don\u2019t adjust to tourists - tourists must adjust to guests.  Even in a country that is known for hospitality towards guests - this is beyond the pale.

Never thought to look it up or ask what it was about?", "I am a hillbilly who has never been anywhere near India, and I know what happens during Holi!  This dude is just an ignorant judgemental fool. It looks like a lot of fun to me, I would enjoy it!", "YTA culture and religion is no excuse to destroy someone\u2019s property.", "YTA. This was entirely *your* failure: by not planning, not properly protecting and guiding him through a foreign tradition and people, and giving vague warnings about dress code. Hinting immediately before the said event, *after everyone is ready*, is not enough! You should\u2019ve had him change. You were a terrible host!\n\nI\u2019m Indian and understand Holi: basically, you wear old clothes, preferably white. Then you basically party with friends covering each other in colored powder, throw water balloons filled with dyed water, and spraying super soakers. Aside from being careful with dyes and powders entering eyes, nose, and mouth, relatively nothing is off limits. In the end, you will come out looking like multiple well endowed unicorns had their rainbow-colored way with you. Your clothes are permanently discolored and multiple showers are required to get everything out of your hair and skin folds.\n\n*Your friend does not know this.* He is visiting a new country. Of course he is going to break out his nicest clothes while traveling. He apparently even went out of his way to buy and wear nice traditional Indian clothes\u2014as a way to fit in and in respect to you and your friends and family. If you knew what type of celebration he was going to be a part of, you should have forewarned him of the dress code. You might have even prepared and provided suitable clothes (Indian thing, if this seems weird to you)!\n\nBefore or on the way, you should have told him what to expect. If children are about to ambush you, you should have blocked them from basically *\u2019assaulting\u2019* Joe\u2014they did not have his consent! Moreover, if they did not know already, you should have prepared your friends to gently include Joe. No Holi party I\u2019ve attended has ever had individuals who surprise-color and spray people without prior consent. Occasionally, children will be children and cause an accident, but they are *quickly* taught. This consent is usually nonverbal among friends, but we always make sure if a stranger is present, they are comfortable with what we are about to do. For example, older aunties and uncles wishing to celebrate Holi but not participate in color usually wear nice clothes. They are always approached with care and asked if they can be colored. If yes, it is usually a careful application on the cheek or forehead without harming their clothes. I refuse to believe you are unaware of such behavior. Regardless of whether this is normal among your group, you should have been actively interdicting anyone coming towards Joe and telling them to be gentle, respectful, and welcoming\u2014even if it means *not* coloring him!\n\nWhat should have happened: you should have told Joe to bring or wear old, casual clothes he is comfortable having permanently discolored or throwing out. If this was a last minute event, you should have warned him before getting dressed or provided clothes yourself. Yours if they\u2019d fit or a male family/friend. Then, you should\u2019ve told him what a Holi celebration entails. You should\u2019ve warned your friends to be respectful and welcoming, as well and start coloring him *slowly*. Since you are his host, it is your job to make sure his inundation into this is comfortable: slowly dipping him toe by toe into these strange rainbow colored waters, not tossing him headfirst without warning! Once he is comfortable, feel free to go ham on him\u2014if he desired so.\n\nThis was entirely your failure and extremely disrespectful to Joe. If he did not know about Holi, all he expected was either a nice dinner, a religious prayer, or a casual get-together with friends. And he respectfully attempted to dress for it with the nice traditional clothes he\u2019d specially bought. Your job wasn\u2019t to joke and allow him to leave the house in those clothes, but to tell him frankly that this is not the kind of event he is expecting and *have him change*. His anger is warranted. He is in his early-20s and buying traditional clothes in NY is expensive! He went out of his way to splurge on clothes for this trip\u2014clothes that were immediately and permanently ruined within probably 30 minutes of putting them on. He didn\u2019t know he was walking into a water-balloon minefield. *You did*, and chose not to protect him, by willful inaction.\n\nWhen you said we\u2019re walking in these clothes and they might be ruined, he assumes he\u2019s going to be mildly overdressed, akin to wearing a suit at a beach barbecue. He expects to be uncomfortably hot and his clothes might need washing from the sand and food. Maybe he\u2019ll stand out too, but he\u2019s already white and a tourist. Therefore, it\u2019s not enough to change since everyone is already ready to go and he figures he\u2019s already wearing appropriate, though overdressed, clothing. What he has no reason to assume, because of your *casual* warning, is that he is literally walking into a battlefield and his clothes will be literally decimated.\n\nSeriously, the Indian in me is gaping at the number and intensity of host-faux pas you\u2019ve made, simply from this small write-up. I can\u2019t imagine the *actual* level of your fuck up. The immigrant who grew up in America empathizes with Joe\u2019s terrible experience and weeps at his bad luck. I genuinely hope he has other, better, Indian friends: Indian celebrations are fun asf, from Holi, to Navratri and Uttarayan. And we are genuinely happy when new people, especially non-Indians, join in.
