He gave me a very judgemental look and asked whether it was appropriate for me to go to his friends party dressed in old ragged clothes especially when his friend had said it would be a \"proper party\". I laughed and explained that not only were we going for a Holi party but we would also have to walk on foot to reach the friends house and whatever clothes we were wearing were bound to get ruined.  Joe still looked a bit annoyed but didn't say anything further.\n\nCut to twenty minutes later and we got out of the car and began the short five minute walk to Joes friends house. A bunch of teenagers ambushed us out of nowhere and within seconds we looked like walking rainbows and were utterly drenched.

The kids could see he was angry but said to me in hindi they couldn't understand what he was saying. I told Joe that and I also told him that I had forewarned him about this and its a very very accepted part of the culture here, something people do not get upset about. Joe got mad at me and told me to explain to the kids that they had to apologise and cough up the money for his clothes. I refused and Joe walked off in a huff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe party went great, it was a typical holi bash and Joe and I immediately fit in being already covered in water and colour and I thought all was fine now.
