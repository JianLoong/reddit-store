It\u2019s interesting, but at this point, I feel like people in NY specifically have a sense of what Holi is about.  There are plenty of Holi celebrations in public parks, and while they try to appropriate it by calling it \u201ccolour runs\u201d or \u201ccolour parties\u201d, New Yorkers are decently exposed to the concept.  Plus, you told him before you left, so even at that point he had a chance to change his clothes.  Query also whether both the host and your other friend explained this to him. \n\nJoe is a guest in a foreign country and went to a huge cultural celebration - he should be not just respecting these rituals but enjoying them (my family is South Indian, but I am dying to celebrate Holi in north India some day - it looks like so much fund (as opposed to celebrating it in NY at just about freezing temperatures)). I also don\u2019t think there was a need to defend - these kids were having fun and doing something totally normal during Holi - did Joe expect that he would have some VIP area to completely protect him from the colours? You did the right thing and handled the situation properly.  And Joe deserves this for making fun of you not being dressed \u201cappropriately\u201d - shocking that the American got the Indian customs so wrong /s.  Fitting that Joe found out, in India no less, that karma really is a bitch. \n\nIf Joe wants to make the most out of India, he has to realise that countries don\u2019t adjust to tourists - tourists must adjust to guests.  Even in a country that is known for hospitality towards guests - this is beyond the pale. I would also remind him that he came to India voluntarily - obviously there are boundaries about his personal comfort, but even at the best of parties, Holi celebrations don\u2019t respect those boundaries in the way he expected them to.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\n>\"Refusing to defend him, making him feel isolated and alone in a foreign country and imposing my culture in an uncomfortable manner without respecting the fact that hes a tourist\"\n\nDon't go to a cultural event when you don't want to experience the culture? And maybe take the advice from the people living in this culture, and if you don't, Google it at least?\n\nI was in India for holi in 2019 and had a blast! I'm blond, and my hair was still slightly purple in some places for a few weeks afterwards. It was worth it! I really had fun. We were warned that it might be rough but it was OK. (and of course I had bought my own powders).", "NTA.  Your \"friend\" would have been fine if he listened to you when you told him to wear old clothes.  How could he expect that his clothes wouldn't be ruined give the holiday celebration?", "I\u2019ll probably be down voted to hell, but Americans are not known as the sharpest tool in the box. Unfortunately your American friends are no exception. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. NTA.", "He was warned. NTA", "Nta, holi sounds so fun, I'm not Indiam however I would love to go one year. Is it okay for a foreigner to celebrate and if so do you have an suggestions for going about it? Anyways once again nta", "NTA -- it sounds like it would have been worth telling him before he came to bring/wear old clothes as he might not have packed anything suitable.\n\nBut you did warn him and once things were underway you handled everything fine.", "NTA\n\nJoe is in YOUR country, where the main culture is YOUR culture. YOU warned him, YOU told him about it... but he wanted to show off in \"nice clothing\" and was completely tone deaf about the whole thing. He wanted to impress and failed, so his ego is bruised, and he tried to take it out on the kids, and on you.\n\nWhat a jerk o\\_O . You owe him nothing.", "NTA. We don't have holi here but we do have \"color runs\", which is I believe heavily inspired by it. Cultural appropriation is not really a thing here...We do celebrate Halloween, St. Patrick's day, St. Valentines day (even though we have our own national day of love), those were imported here as well. It's fairly well known how to dress for these events. Fair enough he was walking on the street but cmon it's common sense not to wear expensive new clothes when I am aware there are colors flying everywhere. Also wtf with \"respecting the fact he's tourist\". He should be the one respecting customs of citizens...", "NTA\n\nHe had warning. That\u2019s his fault", "I do wonder if he had any non-expensive clothes if he bought stuff to fit in in another country. He dressed up for a \"proper party\". Did anyone explain to him what that meant in the context of Holi before he got dressed for it and found out they would be walking through the celebrations?\n\nHe's still the A-H for not asking questions or doing research, but it sounds like no one involved gave him a heads up when he was preparing for his visit, either.\n\nBut NTA, OP", "Seriously!  I learned about Holi and I wanted to do it at my wedding! (We didn\u2019t sadly) \nBut yeah it takes all of a couple minutes to be like \u201c Here\u2019s where I\u2019m going, here\u2019s when I\u2019ll be there are there any major events happening?\u201d", "MAKE WAAAAY FOR PRINCE HOLI!", "Last line tho . Respect. (Am in indian myself and honestly joe was being unreasonable even after being warned and as others pointed out above , it takes 2 seconds to look something up these days and get a very good rough idea about what its gonna be.)\nNTA for sure", "Is it really up to OP to have told him this? OP didn\u2019t invite him to this party - another friend did.  And Joe also acted like he knew more about what was appropriate for Holi than OP did.", "Stay in your country, then. Easy fix.", "What does \"our clothes will get ruined\" mean to you?", "Who only brings nice clothes on a trip huh? Most people pack casually unless they know they'll need fancy clothing. Why are you wearing only fancy clothes on vacation?? Only a fool would pack only expensive clothing without a single casual outfit", "Agreed.", "I'd heard of Holi before but didn't know what it entailed until I watched an episode of a tv show set in India a couple weeks ago. It looked like so much fun, but I wasn't sure if they were just using artistic license so a quick trip to Wikipedia showed me that it is generally that awesome in real life. Joe's a dumbass and it's his own fault.", "Right? I'm not sure this guy is a dumb American - he might just be DUMB. As a dumb American meself, I barely know what Holi is, but I've seen pictures and it looks beautiful and 100% like an event that will ruin your clothes. This guy seems to lack common sense.... and ears to listen to informed advice from his host.", "\nWhy would he listen to some chick from India about the way they do things in India? /s", "It isn't anything painful like paintballs. All the photos I've seen of it, it is like colored chalk. It looks beautiful and really fun, actually.", "Yeah, holi is wild.  Anyone anywhere is fair game. It's a crazy color party in every street, alley, or other public space.", "Definitely NTA then.", "OK but from your post, what you said to him wasn't very informative. If you had told me we were going to a Holi party and we shouldn't dress up smartly because our clothes might get ruined along the way, but you didn't actually explain what a Holi party was, or how our clothes might get ruined along the way, and if I'd never heard about this festival before, I wouldn't have understood what was actually going to happen. \n\nMaybe it's just me. (I can see from the other comments that I seem to be the only person who thinks your explanation was a bit on the skimpy side - which, fair enough, if so!)", "What does \"before he got dressed for it and found out they would be walking through the celebrations\" mean to you?", "Another good comparison is paintball. \"Hey we're going paintballing!\" \"Ok I am wearing my brand new tailored wool suit!\" \"You should change.\" \"No.\" [dumbass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iubog28_KBI)", "Tbh, after his behavior he can educate himself\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care to listen, if he did, you wouldn\u2019t be here", "Yes.  And I also don\u2019t see why the onus is entirely on you - first off, he is an adult; he easily could have educated himself.  Also, you didn\u2019t invite him for Holi - so I don\u2019t understand why the host didn\u2019t have as much of an obligation as you.  And finally, you did warn him, after he tried to mansplain (Americansplain?) about your culture.  If Joe thought he knew so much about Holi, he could handle this himself.", "I live in Texas. I am from rural area, but now I live in a city with a very diverse population and a very large Asian population. Mostly Indian. Our school does an event for the kids every year called the \u201ccolor run\u201d.  The kids run around the outside of the school and at different locations have colored chalk thrown on them. I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that before we moved here but I can see where they got the idea from now.  They all get a white T-shirt for it and wear old jeans or shorts and have a blast.", "Oh I know, I guess ambush is too aggressive of a word for me to use, I just meant I'd be shocked if someone doused me in colored chalk if I wasn't at an event or something.", "That sounds amazing!"]}
