Today was Holi which is a massive festival in India where people dowse each other in colour and water to celebrate. Its also fairly accepted that anyone is fair game on holi, whether you're throwing waterballons from your balcony or chucking colour from the street,  people dowse random strangers and everyone enjoys it.  Joe had another friend living in my city who invited him and me on Holi to show Joe a \"proper holi celebration\".\n\nWe both got ready in the morning, I was wearing an old nightsuit and Joe had dressed up in a newly bought very expensive looking kurta. He gave me a very judgemental look and asked whether it was appropriate for me to go to his friends party dressed in old ragged clothes especially when his friend had said it would be a \"proper party\". I laughed and explained that not only were we going for a Holi party but we would also have to walk on foot to reach the friends house and whatever clothes we were wearing were bound to get ruined.  Joe still looked a bit annoyed but didn't say anything further.\n\nCut to twenty minutes later and we got out of the car and began the short five minute walk to Joes friends house. A bunch of teenagers ambushed us out of nowhere and within seconds we looked like walking rainbows and were utterly drenched. I laughed picked up some of the kids water balloons and chucked them at them but Joe got incredibly mad and started screaming at the kids about how expensive his clothes were, how they ruined it and how they had reimburse him. The kids could see he was angry but said to me in hindi they couldn't understand what he was saying. I told Joe that and I also told him that I had forewarned him about this and its a very very accepted part of the culture here, something people do not get upset about. Joe got mad at me and told me to explain to the kids that they had to apologise and cough up the money for his clothes. I refused and Joe walked off in a huff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe party went great, it was a typical holi bash and Joe and I immediately fit in being already covered in water and colour and I thought all was fine now. However when we got back to my house Joe got really mad at me about \"Refusing to defend him, making him feel isolated and alone in a foreign country and imposing my culture in an uncomfortable manner without respecting the fact that hes a tourist\". I told him he was being unreasonable and went to bed. However later a few of our mutual also American friends texted me that I was being an AH about the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did not think I had done anything wrong but now I'm starting to suspect that I was an AH for not understanding and respecting that my friend might not be comfortable with such traditions and that he had spent a lot on these new Indian clothes.", "created_utc": 1678290348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lznth/aita_for_not_defending_my_friend_when_his/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He obviously sees your culture as a costume and nothing more.", "NTA. You told him in advance about the celebration customs and warned him that his clothes would get ruined. He chose to ignore you and got mad when exactly what you told him was going to happen happened. He's just trying to guilt you with the \"isolated and alone\" line because he was foolish enough to not listen to your warning. As a tourist, it's on him to listen to his host and friend when being informed about parts of your culture he might not be familiar with.", "What, didn\u2019t the entire city get your announcement? \u201cI have an American tourist friend coming, please pause all festivities thanks!\u201c /s\n\nNTA -he was warned", "NTA - Your American friend chose to ignore your warning and didn't listen to you about a custom in your country. He's being culturally insensitive and ignorant, blaming you for something he decided was not his fault, when it clearly was.

It's a tradition in your country that you already explained to Joe.

He\u2019s definitely the AH, and you should tell him not to visit the country again as he\u2019s too disrespectful to appreciate others. If my husband can assimilate well into my traditional family, so can Joe. You gave him a heads up; he chose not to listen.", "NTA at all. Joe is an ugly American tourist. I would consider those clothes better because of the colors thrown on them during a traditional festival.", "INFO what exactly did you tell him about Holi? Was it as vague as your clothes might get ruined (which implies he might be able to opt out or escape it) or did you specifically say that people will feel comfortable throwing dye on you without warning, so anything you wear will get covered in colorful powder and liquids?", "NTA -- if Joe wants to travel, Joe needs to understand that no one else is obligated to accommodate *his* cultural preferences but that he needs to adapt (and should listen to his host's recommendations). \n\nYou might want to reconsider whether it's worth your time to host Joe in the future, though.
