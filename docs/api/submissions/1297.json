We have a lot that are in through family/friends. My mom though, takes it a little too far. She\u2019s married to a cop and 90% if her wardrobe is \u201cpolice wife\u201d stuff. No issues with that itself, but she got furious one time because she got a ticket while wearing the shirt. She thinks being married to a cop should give her the same respect as being a cop. Mind you, her husband doesn\u2019t even get upset when he gets a ticket and doesn\u2019t believe he should get any special treatment just because of his job.\n\nSo, I met my fianc\u00e9 a few years back (we\u2019ve been together for 3 years but were friends for 3 before we started dating). My fianc\u00e9 is the most caring, loving, respectful and moral person I\u2019ve ever met who consistently goes out of his way to help people, even strangers. Literal jackpot. He also happens to be an Afghan vet. I didn\u2019t meet him until after he got out of the military so I by no means consider myself a \u201cmilitary wife\u201d. I wasn\u2019t with him for training, deployment, or for his adjustment back to civilian life. When we get married, he\u2019s wearing a tux, not his uniform (his preference)\n\nMom was obviously thrilled when she found out I was dating a vet. She asked him where he served and he mentioned Afghanistan and now the first thing she says about him when people ask is he is an Afghan vet. It makes him uncomfortable b/c people ask stupid questions that I don\u2019t even ask (he tells me what he\u2019s comfortable with on his own timing). I\u2019ve told her several times to stop telling people b/c it\u2019s not her experience to tell. She tells strangers, posts it on FB, ect. She calls me a military wife even though I\u2019ve told her repeatedly that I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve met his friends & their wives who\u2019ve been there through it all and I feel like it\u2019d be disrespectful to compare my experience w/ theirs. \n\nI told her if she\u2019s doesn\u2019t know him well enough to bring up any of his other amazing traits she doesn\u2019t know him enough to be talking about him serving & to stop bringing up his vet status every time she talks about him & not to call me a MW. I told her she was using him to get respect by association. She got upset & said I should be happy she\u2019s supportive of his status b/c \u201ca lot of people aren\u2019t\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t shame her for being a patriot. I may be AH here because she says she is just trying to be supportive, but I don\u2019t want my fianc\u00e9 to keep being made uncomfortable.\n\nSo,was I TAH for calling her out?", "created_utc": 1667584338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym5jmr/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_stop_bringing_up_my/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You will be an AH if you just keep arguing about it. If it makes you or your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable then don\u2019t spend time with her. You\u2019ve told her your wishes but you do nit get to control her behavior, only your own.", "NTA. Your mom should respect your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wishes and boundaries, as well as yours. It\u2019s great that\u2019s proud of him but it sounds like she takes it too far. As someone who works with combat Veterans, it really bothers me when people don\u2019t respect that it\u2019s inappropriate to pry about a Veteran\u2019s deployment history or military service in general. If he wants to talk about it great, but she needs to follow his lead. And like you said, he\u2019s more than his military service and she should know him as a whole person.", "NTA but - she can wear whatever she wants and talk about being married to a cop however much she wants. \n\nI don't even thinks she crazy for mentioning her future son in law is a veteran if someone is asking about him. What seems weird is that if you, mom, veteran fiance and some random person are all standing there they are asking mom about him but not him directly? And then start asking him- what types of questions? Can he not just say yes I served in such and such branch and now I sell insurance? \n\nAs to calling you a military wife for sure stand your ground. That makes no sense. But the mere acknowledgement he served being an experience only he can tell feels restrictive unless fiance wants zero mention of him serving.", "NTA. Personally, I find people like your mother insufferable. Being proud of your partner or family member's service to the country/the community is one thing. Labeling yourself according to THEIR profession and making it your social persona, usually expecting special treatment for it, is another. \n\nBut regardless of what I think of her, she's TA because she has no right to publicly label you and your fianc\u00e9 in a way you've both expressly told her do not agree or want. \n\nShe needs to learn what boundaries are and respect yours. Or she should get a time-out and a public call-out on her behavior until she can behave.", "NTA, it is not her experience and she is trying to capitalize on it. Please also buy her new clothes.", "NTA for calling her out.  It makes your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable and she needs to cut it out!", "Thank you for your feedback! I agree with the special treatment thing. Like I said, her husband doesn\u2019t expect any special treatment and never pulls the \u201cI\u2019m a cop care\u201d, even when he gets pulled over. I actually have a friend who\u2019s a cop who pulled me over once for speeding and gave me a ticket (as per his job) and we had a bonfire the same night when he got out of work \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you for your feedback. I do think why I may have been to hard is I think it is ignorant. I don\u2019t think she is intentionally being rude or crossing boundaries and I don\u2019t think she even thinks about it as seeking that attention. We are going to have a sit down talk with her about boundaries. She has a lot of military, first responders in her life and I think it gives her the impression that she understands their experiences but no one who hasn\u2019t been there first hand can truly understand", "Hi there, I appreciate your feedback! Not enough room in the post to get all the details but to clear some stuff up, she\u2019s posted pictures of us on Facebook (with my permission, she is really respectful about that) but when people comment \u201ccute couple\u201d, she says \u201cyep! And he\u2019s a vet too!\u201d He has no problem with people knowing but when people ask he gives basics like what his job was and how long he was in and she goes \u201che also served in Afghanistan!\u201d People ask certain questions (I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being disrespectful, people are just curious) and he just kinda changes the subject or says he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it and it usually gets the point across and people stop but it\u2019s just awkward for a bit. For the military wife part, I don\u2019t think she has bad intentions completely and just wants me to be proud, but it\u2019s only a small part of who my fianc\u00e9 is and like I said, I didn\u2019t meet him until after he served so I don\u2019t by any means consider myself as such. I\u2019m proud to be with an amazing man who makes me feel like a queen every day, validates my feelings, works harder than anyone I\u2019ve ever met, and always sticks to his morals", "You aren't the asshole but here's a thought. This will pass soon. Not because your mom will stop talking about it but because soon no one will ask or talk about him because you'll be married and not new and interesting. Is your mom too much? Absolutrly. But as parents go, this isn't an awful thing to deal with."]}
