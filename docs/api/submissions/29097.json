But this time i am feeling a type of way because imy wedding will be in February 2024 and my sister, who is also one of the brides maids has shown me what she intends to wear. i was shocked to say the least. The dress shows clearly that she's not wearing a bra or panties because it has a slit up to her waist and her back and chest are barely covered. I'm uncomfortable with her being around other people especially my fiance and his family looking like that. My parents see nothing wrong with her outfit. I told her if she doesn't find a different more decent dress, then she is no longer one of the brides maids and she's not invited to my wedding anymore. She feels that I'm being unfair since i have no right to control what people wear and i also let all bridesmaids choose whatever design they wanted as long as they stuck to the colors i gave. her chosen color sticks to the color scheme and that's okay but the design makes me feel it's not appropriate. I don't want my sister flashing my guests but she called me an AH when i disinvited her. Now she and my parents are not talking to me.

Your family is cool with skimpy outfits but this wedding isnt just for your family it is literally about joining your families, often its the first time extended family from both sides meet and you would be hurt if her outfit made anyone uncomfortable. Stress that you want her to get to know her new family and you arent sure how they will react to such a skimpy outfit. If she doesnt care thats her choice but you also cant control other peoples reactions which might not be nice. Why even risk it?\n\nThe point is it is your wedding, your dress code, and you are asking her because it would make you happy and less stressed knowing she will be there supporting you on your day.
