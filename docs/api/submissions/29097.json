I told her if she doesn't find a different more decent dress, then she is no longer one of the brides maids and she's not invited to my wedding anymore. She feels that I'm being unfair since i have no right to control what people wear and i also let all bridesmaids choose whatever design they wanted as long as they stuck to the colors i gave. her chosen color sticks to the color scheme and that's okay but the design makes me feel it's not appropriate. I don't want my sister flashing my guests but she called me an AH when i disinvited her. Now she and my parents are not talking to me.

You absolutely have the right to dictate what members of YOUR wedding party are wearing. Many brides pick one dress and expects everyone in the party to wear it. You are being too accommodating.

Where is the wedding?\n\nThe dress you describe (slit to the waist, low back, cleavage out) is an evening gown. That's usually not appropriate for most weddings. If she was going to a ball or something, it would be appropriate. But unless this is an evening wedding, then eveningwear isn't really appropriate.", "NTA. Its your wedding. You can dictate pretty much anything.", "YTA. You gave no specifics to the dress requirement until after she got hers. You blew your chance to have a say.

That is, of course if there is a need of a compromise.\n\nOtherwise, it is your wedding, you should anyway be free to invite people or not. Even when it is you sister, or mother, or anybody else.

It was a guest\u2019s sister, brought as a plus one who repeatedly flashed the reception while dancing up on anyone who stood still long enough in a high slit skirt and no underwear.  As it happened, she was a pretty person, but no, it wasn\u2019t about outshining anyone. It was her making a spectacle of herself and introducing nudity and quite frankly, really inappropriate dance moves into what was a classy formal event.  I love my friend.
