I have my own room where I wfh, I go in office one or two days a week. My partner also works from home but goes into office a few times a week. My partner has a car but refuses to drive his own into work. He drives a sports car and says that he doesn\u2019t want his colleagues to see/judge him for this. So he has been driving my car for the past three years. Recently (the past year) I\u2019ve been telling him to purchase his own car. He has the funds and it\u2019s been interfering with my ability to leave the house, so I felt it was an appropriate ask.  Whenever he takes my car I\u2019m unable to run any errands/leave the house unless I order an Uber because I don\u2019t know how to drive his stick sports car. \n\nThis morning I was in a work meeting, it was an important one to me. When I have an important meeting and I\u2019m on camera I often lock my door in case my partner accidentally walks in and I put my phone on do not disturb. Midway into the call, a section where I would have to present was approaching, my partner begins knocking on my door. I texted him that I was in a call and asked what he was looking for. He said he needed one of my yoga towels as he was going into work and taking a yoga class with his coworkers. He goes to these yoga classes every week so I got irritated that he didn\u2019t prepare. I quickly turned off my camera and unlocked my door so he could grab it, after a few moments of looking, he starts talking to me and since I\u2019m in a call and actively listening I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying so I text him asking what he\u2019s looking for. He said he couldn\u2019t find a towel and just stands there. So in interest to help him, I turn my camera off again and grabbed it for him. \n\nRather than saying a quick thank you he mumbled \u201cyou\u2019re not even an important person on that call\u201d and rushes out of my room. Anger took over and I asked him to clarify what he said and he starts talking about how he\u2019s late and that I wasn\u2019t even talking on call and that I was being dramatic. This made me so mad I yelled at him that I\u2019m asking him to consider why I\u2019m working so hard, as this was a crucial meeting. He tried to avoid the conversation and tried to leave, which he often does, so I got triggered and told him he couldn\u2019t take my car to work as I needed it in the afternoon and didn\u2019t feel like taking an Uber, but he was welcome to call a car. \n\nRecently I saw the whole Steven crowder wife video of him not letting his wife take the car and this is now bothering me. I feel like the asshole for limiting his ability to leave the home now.

He's not embarrassed, he just wants to keep his as a weekender/track day car instead of a daily driver racking up miles on the odometer and risking accidents or scratches or scraped rims from a curb or any of the other things that are a standard daily risk of driving a car in a city.\n\nThis is a man who just thinks he's the center of his partner's universe and expects her to give him what he wants all the time regardless of the impact on her, bc he doesn't care how his behavior impacts her.", "Definitely NTA he doesn\u2019t value her as person nor does he value her possessions", "[removed]", "In my house we say \u2018look with your hands\u2019 Because there will be a literal pile of papers and books and toys right on the surface where the thing is most likely to be and they\u2019ll just look and not move anything around. Last place you saw it was the coffee table and you can\u2019t determine if it\u2019s still there unless you MOVE STUFF from the giant pile (\u2026 and put it away while you\u2019re at it)", "This was my thought too", "I got a protective order against an ex for hindering my ability to leave the house. He would take my car all the time, but the real issue was that whenever I tried to leave the house he\u2019d call the cops and lie by saying I was drunk or threatening to hurt myself. Either way, this post made me think of him a bit.\n\nYou make a really good point and it was one I didn\u2019t want to really see based on fear of projection. So, thank you for saying it. He is hurting OP financially as well, and hell, mentally/emotionally by saying she was unimportant in the meeting. It\u2019s hard to say this is the norm for him, but it\u2019s such a basic, day-to-day type of interaction that it\u2019s not unfair to think he does stuff like this decently often. Invalidating, unkind words towards OP that are meant to cause insecurity and guilt. He\u2019s the one being a dillweed, yet treating OP like he matters more and she should act like it. That\u2019s not okay.\n\nI really hope OP recognizes that this is a much bigger issue, especially with her being on her and fearing that she\u2019s abusive towards him. I had so many of those moments when in the worst of it and that\u2019s what was messed up\u2026 I was being abused, yet scared that I was the abusive one if I did even the smallest thing to stand up for myself. I went through a really severe and traumatic situation, but even if he\u2019s not \u201cas bad\u201d as my ex, he\u2019s still doing some severe damage. OP shouldn\u2019t have to feel fear that she\u2019s being abusive. Stuff like this does so much more to a person than any of us may realize. Small things seem small until they build and build on top of each other.\n\nSo again, thank you for bringing this up. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem like a huge thing, it\u2019s usually not until you look at a bigger picture.", "That's exactly what I read out of it, too. She can't drive his car so she's trapped at home unless she forks out money for an  Uber, which on top of all her other expenses keeps her financially dependent on him and his house. Plus he felt the need to diminish her  importance to her job and try to sabotage her meeting because he's too insecure to have her paying attention to anything other than him.", "Agreed, this is abuse and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to eventually escalate.", "Thank you!!", "I think that's built in when one spouse doesn't value the other. When someone sees their spouse as a \"less than\" I think control is automatically a part of the recipe.\nOne expects to be able to exert control over someone they is beneath them. She should 100% be looking out for other ways he is controlling. \nI don't even know that he's consciousness about how he is controlling her movements. I think right now it's more of he believes any expectation he has of her is valid and that includes that she should sit and wait for him to be available with her own car.", "#NTA , your not limiting him at all , he has a car , tell him to stop being a pansy and drive his sports car , if he can\u2019t take being judged for owning a sports car then he shouldn\u2019t have bought it .", "I don\u2019t really understand people who buy sports cars and don\u2019t have a daily car\u2026 like everything you said is correct. He doesn\u2019t want to risk damage or losing value by driving his car. In my mind, if you can\u2019t afford a daily use car, you can\u2019t afford a sports car. Hell, he could at least be the one to use a ride service considering he\u2019s getting in the way of OP using her own car for even errands. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s asking her to use a ride service to go out to the bar while he uses the car, which is valid, she\u2019s ordering rides to and from the grocery store and for other errands. It seems like he uses OP\u2019s car more than her and definitely using it more than he uses his car.\n\nWhen OP needs to replace her car is he going to pitch in for the payment? Does he help pay when it needs work done? What if he gets in to an accident? Is he on her car insurance? Does he help pay for her car insurance? Why tf is OP helping him pay his mortgage unless he\u2019s helping pay for the car? He is benefiting from OP financially while OP is losing money to him and because of him. Hell, he even poses a risk to her job. What if he somehow leads to her losing her job? Will he help her out financially or will he just be adding up what OP \u201cowes\u201d while looking for work?\n\nThis dude is not it\u2026 just holy guacamole. OP deserves so much better. This dude seems parasitic. I\u2019m not gonna say he\u2019s financially abusive, but damn, if I knew more about their relationship I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he turned out to be like that.", "Bot reply stolen from u/Angry-pothead", "Bot", "Everyone deserves to be with someone who treats them with kindness. I carry that as a baseline. Doesn't have to get bad. We deserve kindness and if all of us set that as the FIRST qualifier there would be no need for small things to build up to the big show, because you can't mistake when someone is unkind. Wish I had given myself that much grace when I was younger.", "This is where I don't understand the thinking,his choice to inhibit his ability to get around by buying a car he's ashamed of and making it her problem,then she actually compares HERSELF to some abusive fuck .\ud83e\udd2f", "LOL!! Yes!!"]}
