I have my own room where I wfh, I go in office one or two days a week. My partner also works from home but goes into office a few times a week. My partner has a car but refuses to drive his own into work. He drives a sports car and says that he doesn\u2019t want his colleagues to see/judge him for this. So he has been driving my car for the past three years. Recently (the past year) I\u2019ve been telling him to purchase his own car. He has the funds and it\u2019s been interfering with my ability to leave the house, so I felt it was an appropriate ask.  Whenever he takes my car I\u2019m unable to run any errands/leave the house unless I order an Uber because I don\u2019t know how to drive his stick sports car. \n\nThis morning I was in a work meeting, it was an important one to me. When I have an important meeting and I\u2019m on camera I often lock my door in case my partner accidentally walks in and I put my phone on do not disturb. Midway into the call, a section where I would have to present was approaching, my partner begins knocking on my door. I texted him that I was in a call and asked what he was looking for. He said he needed one of my yoga towels as he was going into work and taking a yoga class with his coworkers. He goes to these yoga classes every week so I got irritated that he didn\u2019t prepare. I quickly turned off my camera and unlocked my door so he could grab it, after a few moments of looking, he starts talking to me and since I\u2019m in a call and actively listening I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying so I text him asking what he\u2019s looking for. He said he couldn\u2019t find a towel and just stands there. So in interest to help him, I turn my camera off again and grabbed it for him. \n\nRather than saying a quick thank you he mumbled \u201cyou\u2019re not even an important person on that call\u201d and rushes out of my room. Anger took over and I asked him to clarify what he said and he starts talking about how he\u2019s late and that I wasn\u2019t even talking on call and that I was being dramatic. This made me so mad I yelled at him that I\u2019m asking him to consider why I\u2019m working so hard, as this was a crucial meeting. He tried to avoid the conversation and tried to leave, which he often does, so I got triggered and told him he couldn\u2019t take my car to work as I needed it in the afternoon and didn\u2019t feel like taking an Uber, but he was welcome to call a car. \n\nRecently I saw the whole Steven crowder wife video of him not letting his wife take the car and this is now bothering me. I feel like the asshole for limiting his ability to leave the home now.

So anytime I leave the house I ask if she minds if I take the Subaru, because she won't drive the Jeep unless she has to.  I prefer taking the Subaru most places, but I won't leave her stranded.  And she could drive the Jeep if she absolutely had to it's not like OP where the other car is a Manual that she can't drive.", "this, OP isn't an asshole but she's an idiot for agreeing to this arrangement, no matter how sweet a deal it may seem in the short term. She's gonna get screwed over by her boyfriend who managed to get himself a tenant he can have sex with who came with a FREE CAR\n\nIf she thinks things are exploitative now, she needs to buckle up for when he takes advantage of his status as her landlord", "Lol, I\u2019m also curious about this.", "My husband has a curtain between his office and the living room. If he is in a meeting, we don't go in, even our dog knows she is not allowed in there", "Or don't learn well and drive his car any time he takes yours.", "This is weaponized incompetence.  He can't find the towel so he just STANDS there.  He wants her car because \\*reasons\\* which means she's trapped into paying extra money.", "> Yeah, my initial assumption was that the Crowder video bothered you because he's regularly limiting YOUR ability to leave the house\n\nRIGHT?!  Made me sad for OP that they saw that video and convinced themselves they were the abuser in it rather than the wife when...obviously not true."]}
