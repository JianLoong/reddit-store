Your son is weird in insisting that both sides of the family should behave the same way - in fact it is better for the children to learn that families and people are different and celebrate in different ways/with different food. The children are also not that young that this is going to be a difficult concept to have. You are totally in your right to not want to jump over hurdles that he imposed to come to your Thanksgiving dinner. If he wants to have that food, he should bring it. \n\nYour son is also an asshole for threatening you with not seeing your grandkids. He was banking on using this ultimatum as a trump card and you didn't fall for it.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Your son isn\u2019t in any position to demand anything of you. \n\nHe thinks a fried turkey is so necessary, he can bring it.", "NTA, if this is something he wants, then he can bring it.  You have seen the grands 4 times in 13 yrs, he has some nerve.  He made his decision back then, to not have a relationship.  Now he thinks he and his family can come waltzing in and dictate the whole celebration.  Ummmm that is a hard NO.  I don't blame you.  He's trying to hold the visit with you hostage, don't fall for it.  It's a real shame that he's teaching his kids these things.  If they want what is served at the other grandparents house, perhaps they should go there.", "NTA. So your son barely pays attention to you in 13 years, but when the other grandparents aren't available, your son tells you have have to replicate the other \"grandparent experience\" for children whom you've met four times? Heck no. That was a fairly stupid threat he made to you, considering you barely see the children anyway.", "NTA\n\nHe's way out of line to demand you make a fried turkey just because that's what his inlaws do. The kids are old enough to know people don't make the same exact meal for holiday dinners. If he wants a fried turkey so bad, he can go buy the fryer and do it himself. It's a ridiculous demand and he's the AH for threatening you with not seeing your grandchildren.", "Nta.  Your son fafo. He was trying to use the kids not coming over as leverage to get you do things how he wants it backfired.  Put your son on a time out. Don't cave.", "NTA\n\nSo much to unpack here. \n\nI suspect, as others have suggested here, that your son wants the fried turkey, and thought that his attempted blackmail would get him what he wanted. There is the possibility that the kids are on the spectrum, and need to have fried turkey. I don't think this is a strong possibility, as in that case, the kids would likely need their 'safe foods' or whatever, and not a special annual meal. \n\nI also suspect that the son, and likely also the daughter-in-law, have used this extortion gambit effectively in the past with HER parents. They're now learning that, having failed to get you hooked on the grandchildren's affections early on, the threat of withdrawal is ineffective. \n\nYou may want to find out from the other family members what version of events is being spun around this. I have a hard time believing that your son is being forthcoming with his attempted emotional blackmail over how the turkey is prepared. So you may want to reach out and present your facts. \n\nEnjoy your roast turkey.", "NTA but your son is. Demanding what gets made at thanksgiving that you aren\u2019t hosting? Then threatening not to come when the demands aren\u2019t met? What an asshole.", "NTA. TBH, I\u2019m so over the demands for specific dishes prepared just so for Thanksgiving, \u201cfor the children.\u201d You can\u2019t have a gourmet homemade cranberry sauce \u2014 it has to be the 79 cent can from the cheap supermarket because that\u2019s how their grandmother does it. You can\u2019t do something to offset the sugar in the sweet potatoes, you have to double down on it with marshmallows, because it\u2019s \u201ctradition.\u201d If you don\u2019t drop all your cooking choices and make everything \u201cthe way the children like it,\u201d the family doesn\u2019t want to come.

Growing up I was fortunate to live close to both sides of my extended family and often for holidays we'd go visit one side for a few hours then go visit the other side. \n\nOne of the best parts was getting to eat different things at each place. \n\nYour son is overreacting.", "NTA\n\nI feel there is more underneath this story.  Why haven't you seen these children more than 4 times?  I have two grandsons who are not even two and I have traveled across the country twice to see one of them (the other lives on my street), and my daughter has come to me also, so more than 4 times in only less than two years.  I feel like you and your son already have a rocky relationship for whatever reason.  \n\nAnyway, back to the topic, I loathe frying food at my house, the mess, the smell, it's just disgusting.  I would not change my menu for anyone, we are always welcoming for anything a guest wants to bring to add to the meal, but do not ask me to change what I do.  I probably would not have gone as far as saying not to come, but you are still NTA for not making another family's traditional thanksgiving.", "Nope, guests do not get to set the menu.  He is trying to weaponize his kids by threats of keeping them from you.  It obviously bothers the hell out of him that you didn\u2019t react with panic and conformity.  Enjoy your holiday because with his attitude it probably wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant anyway.  The kids do not know you so they won\u2019t be disappointed.", "Hell no. If he wants a fried turkey then he prepares it. If not then he can take the grandkids back to the other grandparents.What entitled jerk. NTA", "NTA. He made a threat that he apparently isn't willing to follow up on because he thought it would be enough to manipulate you. You called his bullshit and now he's having a hissy fit about it. Let him. Enjoy your thanksgiving.", "NTA, *your home, your dinner, your choice.* He can\u2019t decide what goes on at your house.\n\n**However,** you don\u2019t seem particularly interested in your son or his kids, and you frankly don\u2019t seem interested in any fix to that. I suppose that well within your rights, but blaming proximity as the reason is lazy. I spent most of my life half a world away from friends and family that I am close to and have always been.\n\nDuring COVID we were able to shift out entire lives to digital, yet maintaining a distant relationship is too much?\n\nYou\u2019re right.

The \"blowing up the phone\" line is such an obvious sign.", "The son comes off as if it really is him that wants the fried turkey and is disappointed that he won't get some this year, so he wants you to make it. But using the kids as an excuse. So odd he is so adamant.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting treated this way by your own kid.\n\nSuper rude to demand someone make something when they are already hosting you, it\u2019s not like a fried turkey is a dietary requirement for health/safety reasons. He should definitely be bring that himself if that\u2019s all the kids will eat for whatever reason.\n\nI hope you have other kids who respect you and grandkids you\u2019ve been able to bond with xxx", "NTA. Your son is incredibly rude.", "NTA. Do not make the same stuff. Your son is acting entitled. He is trying to dictate what & how you cook Your Thanksgiving dinner. You aren't obligated to cook the same exact meal that his kids are used to at the other GP's house. Your house, your dinner.", "I mean, the way you're making the conversation sound, it doesn't sound like you have a very warm relationship of any kind with your son and his wife at all.  'he told me I need to make xyz food' I told him no' 'He told me if I don't 'make xyz food' I won't see the kids'.  I mean...you speak terribly to each other, why do you even want to be around each other? \n\nHe's an AH for using a stupid 'withholding kids' threat, which is childish and only hurts the kids, if anyone...although it backfired on him.\n\nYou're kind of an AH for basically ignoring your own grandkids just because they don't live in your state.  You don't talk on the phone? Build what relationship you can? To flippantly say 'fine dont' come' , while it's your perogative, doesn't really sound like anyone cares about the relationship, and I guess you're further distancing yourself from your grandkids.  You're totally right not to be forced to make a fried turkey your son is an AH for 'demanding' it but don't be so flippant about your grandkids, that's all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
