{"id": 12717, "submission_id": "11w4mep", "title": "AITA for refusing to spend my money on my stepdaughter's wedding?", "selftext": "My wife passed away when my sons were 8 and 4 respectively. Since then I remarried and my new wife and I have been married for some 11 years now. She herself was married before and had a daughter of her own from her own past marriage. Her ex-husband's story is its own saga but suffice to say he's alive but isn't in their life anymore.\n\nWhen we married, my bio-children were 13 (son) and 9 (son) and my step-daughter was 12 (step-daughter). For 11 years I tried to make some bridges, I would get her gifts and try to make sure she always got what she wanted. I did everything I could to make her happy.\n\nI would drive her to school, be at her extra-curriculars, I paid for the nicest private schools for her I could. Not to mention, I worked day and night so I could give her the lifestyle she deserved (my wife is a house-wife, a choice she made after she voluntarily quit her job in marketing). I tried my best and treated her just like my sons, but she continued to hate me.\n\nThis came to a head specifically when my step-daughter graduated about 5 years ago. While my eldest son had invited my wife (his stepmom) to his graduation, my stepdaughter refused to invite me. She had two tickets, but she only invited her mother (her grandparents refused as they live in my wife's native country). When I asked why? She said \"You're not my dad, you didn't raise me, and I don't want you in my life\". I was heartbroken, I tried very hard for her to like me but she hated me. Still I paid for her college (I paid for both of my son's colleges as well).\n\nNevertheless, a few months back, she informed my wife that she will be getting married. I only found out, when my wife told me.\n\nWhat was even more devastating is that she said she would come home to celebrate, and I brought a cake, and balloons and so much more. Then, last minute, she changed plans. She just told my wife that she should come over to her apartment, without my sons and I. I was shattered.\n\nWhen I did eventually called to congratulate her, she just tried to end the conversation as quickly as she could. The last thing I had asked was maybe the honor to have a father-daughter dance with her, which she had shot down.\n\nI said nothing, but then came the bill and my wife said she needed some money for her wedding. I considered it long and hard, but clearly as she didn't consider me as her father, I said I would not be paying for her wedding. I told my wife, that she had money saved up, it was her to choice to use that if she wanted, but I would not be paying for her wedding. She was furious at me, she said she barely had any money saved up and I was being an awful person.\n\nI have received calls from all of my wife's family telling me that I should pay (mainly her immediate family, like my father-in-law and my brother-in-law). The whole thing has become a mess, it has divided our family but I am still holding my ground. AITA?\n\n**1ST EDIT:** I want to be clear, I will absolutely be paying for my son's wedding when it comes\n\n**2ND EDIT:** I want to also clarify that this is going to be far from a minor financial inconvenience. While, I am sufficiently wealthy, it is still not something that will not go easy on my bank-account. My wife's family is Indian. Her ex-husband was Indian and my step-daughter is Indian. Her wedding is going to have probably around 400-600 people.\n\n**3RD EDIT:** My wife has been an amazing mother to both our boys and our girl. She is loving and dotting wife, who runs a phenomenal house. She tried to get her close to me as well, to little consequence. I also do not think that I could be where I am without her (and certainly before her I was nowhere close to where I am in my success). It is also true that my money has always been our-money, and she does most of the accounting for the house anyway. If I do this I would be doing this for her, not my stepdaughter. \n\nMoreover, if she really wanted to, she could do it without my approval. More than half the money is in bank accounts with her name on them (long story, involving bad business decisions early in my life, which gave me bad credit). If she wanted to, she could. She never has and I do not think she will. If she does that will be her choice, and even if she told me she was going to, I do not think I will stop her.

Since then I remarried and my new wife and I have been married for some 11 years now. She herself was married before and had a daughter of her own from her own past marriage. Her ex-husband's story is its own saga but suffice to say he's alive but isn't in their life anymore. \n\nWhen we married, my bio-children were 13 (son) and 9 (son) and my step-daughter was 12 (step-daughter). For the last 7 years I've tried to make some bridges, I would get her gifts and try to make sure she always got what she wanted. I did everything I could to make her happy.\n\nI would drive her to school, be at her extra-curriculars, I paid for the nicest private schools for her I could. Not to mention, I worked day and night so I could give her the lifestyle she deserved (my wife is a house-wife, a choice she made after she voluntarily quit her job in marketing). I tried my best and treated her just like my sons, but she continued to hate me.\n\nThis came to a head specifically when my step-daughter graduated about 5 years ago. While my eldest son had invited my wife (his stepmom) to his graduation, my stepdaughter refused to invite me. She had two tickets, but she only invited her mother (her grandparents refused as they live in my wife's native country). When I asked why? She said \"You're not my dad, you didn't raise me, and I don't want you in my life\". I was heartbroken, I tried very hard for her to like me but she hated me. Still I paid for her college (I paid for both of my son's colleges as well). \n\nNevertheless, a few months back, she informed my wife that she will be getting married. I only found out, when my wife told me.\n\nWhat was even more devastating is that she said she would come home to celebrate, and I brought a cake, and balloons and so much more. Then, last minute, she changed plans. She just told my wife that she should come over to her apartment, without my sons and I. I was shattered. \n\nWhen I did eventually called to congratulate her, she just tried to end the conversation as quickly as she could. The last thing I had asked was maybe the honor to have a father-daughter dance with her, which she had shot down. \n\nI said nothing, but then came the bill and my wife said she needed some money for her wedding. I considered it long and hard, but clearly as she didn't consider me as her father, I said I would not be paying for her wedding. I told my wife, that she had money saved up, it was her to choice to use that if she wanted, but I would not be paying for her wedding. She was furious at me, she said she barely had any money saved up and I was being an awful person.\n\nI have received calls from all of my wife's family telling me I am being an awful person. The whole thing has become a mess, it has divided our family but I am still holding my ground. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She has been enabled enough. OP needs to cut the purse strings.", "Don\u2019t do that. Stop trying to force what\u2019s not there. This will only make her resent you more. Pay for it or don\u2019t. Do not give ultimatums", "You already did your duty and paid for her college, that\u2019s where it should end. She keeps saying you are not her father, nothing is going to change. If you put the ultimatum of doing the fatherly duties at the wedding, she can easily say yes and the day off change her mind. She can easily agree to that to get you to pay. \nYour wife knew her daughter didn\u2019t consider you her father, so my question is why didn\u2019t she save money for that?!", "If that minor thing is to help someone who treats him poorly, his wife is TA for asking him in the first place", "Wife can go and request the money for it from her ex-husband then. OP did not raise his step-daughter according to her and she does not consider him her father in any shape or form. He can absolutely pay for his sons weddings with zero guilt even if he does not pay for hers.", "She already hates my damn guts. Her hate may grow but how much more could it possibly be.\n\nEdit: This would be purely for petty reasons as I know she doesn't want me there.", "Regardless of how right someone may be to do, or not do, something doesn\u2019t absolve them of being considered an asshole. You should know this by now.", "Dude, please act like an adult. Just don\u2019t pay for her wedding", "Right. A person who isn't considering how wrong it is to ask someone who is being treated poorly to give money to the person who is treating them poorly may see them as TA for saying no"]}
