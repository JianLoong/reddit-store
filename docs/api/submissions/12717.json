{"id": 12717, "submission_id": "11w4mep", "title": "AITA for refusing to spend my money on my stepdaughter's wedding?", "selftext": "**EDIT:** \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* [**sickofraciststepdad**](https://www.reddit.com/user/sickofraciststepdad/) **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*,** is pretending to be my stepdaughter & is **NOT** my actual stepdaughter.\n\nMy wife passed away when my sons were 8 and 4 respectively. Since then I remarried and my new wife and I have been married for some 11 years now. She herself was married before and had a daughter of her own from her own past marriage. Her ex-husband's story is its own saga but suffice to say he's alive but isn't in their life anymore.\n\nWhen we married, my bio-children were 13 (son) and 9 (son) and my step-daughter was 12 (step-daughter). For 11 years I tried to make some bridges, I would get her gifts and try to make sure she always got what she wanted. I did everything I could to make her happy.\n\nI would drive her to school, be at her extra-curriculars, I paid for the nicest private schools for her I could. Not to mention, I worked day and night so I could give her the lifestyle she deserved (my wife is a house-wife, a choice she made after she voluntarily quit her job in marketing). I tried my best and treated her just like my sons, but she continued to hate me.\n\nThis came to a head specifically when my step-daughter graduated about 5 years ago. While my eldest son had invited my wife (his stepmom) to his graduation, my stepdaughter refused to invite me. She had two tickets, but she only invited her mother (her grandparents refused as they live in my wife's native country). When I asked why? She said \"You're not my dad, you didn't raise me, and I don't want you in my life\". I was heartbroken, I tried very hard for her to like me but she hated me. Still I paid for her college (I paid for both of my son's colleges as well).\n\nNevertheless, a few months back, she informed my wife that she will be getting married. I only found out, when my wife told me.\n\nWhat was even more devastating is that she said she would come home to celebrate, and I brought a cake, and balloons and so much more. Then, last minute, she changed plans. She just told my wife that she should come over to her apartment, without my sons and I. I was shattered.\n\nWhen I did eventually called to congratulate her, she just tried to end the conversation as quickly as she could. The last thing I had asked was maybe the honor to have a father-daughter dance with her, which she had shot down.\n\nI said nothing, but then came the bill and my wife said she needed some money for her wedding. I considered it long and hard, but clearly as she didn't consider me as her father, I said I would not be paying for her wedding. I told my wife, that she had money saved up, it was her to choice to use that if she wanted, but I would not be paying for her wedding. She was furious at me, she said she barely had any money saved up and I was being an awful person.\n\nI have received calls from all of my wife's family telling me that I should pay (mainly her immediate family, like my father-in-law and my brother-in-law). The whole thing has become a mess, it has divided our family but I am still holding my ground. AITA?\n\n**1ST EDIT:** I want to be clear, I will absolutely be paying for my son's wedding when it comes\n\n**2ND EDIT:** I want to also clarify that this is going to be far from a minor financial inconvenience. While, I am sufficiently wealthy, it is still not something that will not go easy on my bank-account. My wife's family is Indian. Her ex-husband was Indian and my step-daughter is Indian. Her wedding is going to have probably around 400-600 people.\n\n**3RD EDIT:** My wife has been an amazing mother to both our boys and our girl. She is loving and dotting wife, who runs a phenomenal house. She tried to get her daughter close to me as well, to little consequence. I also do not think that I could be where I am without her (and certainly before her I was nowhere close to where I am in my success). It is also true that my money has always been our-money, and she does most of the accounting for the house anyway. If I do this I would be doing this for her, not my daughter.\n\nMoreover, if she really wanted to, she could do it without my approval. More than half the money is in bank accounts with her name on them (long story, involving bad business decisions early in my life, which gave me bad credit). If she wanted to, she could. She never has and I do not think she will. If she does that will be her choice, and even if she told me she was going to, I do not think I will stop her.\n\n**4th EDIT:** Some of you have DMed me questions about my life. Yes I do have one son with my wife. My wife had her daughter when she was quite young (19) and we had a baby boy (it was not planned and he is 3 now) after my daughter graduated. I wished to keep parts of my life hidden because they were not important to this story, but some of you have mentioned that this may be important to the story as it may have impacted my relationship with my daughter. I assure you, she was just as cold with me before the baby and the event at her graduation happened before my daughter knew about the pregnancy.", "created_utc": 1679276304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11w4mep/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_my_money_on_my/", "score": 5209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since then I remarried and my new wife and I have been married for some 11 years now. She herself was married before and had a daughter of her own from her own past marriage. Her ex-husband's story is its own saga but suffice to say he's alive but isn't in their life anymore. \n\nWhen we married, my bio-children were 13 (son) and 9 (son) and my step-daughter was 12 (step-daughter). For the last 7 years I've tried to make some bridges, I would get her gifts and try to make sure she always got what she wanted. I did everything I could to make her happy.\n\nI would drive her to school, be at her extra-curriculars, I paid for the nicest private schools for her I could. Not to mention, I worked day and night so I could give her the lifestyle she deserved (my wife is a house-wife, a choice she made after she voluntarily quit her job in marketing). I tried my best and treated her just like my sons, but she continued to hate me.\n\nThis came to a head specifically when my step-daughter graduated about 5 years ago. While my eldest son had invited my wife (his stepmom) to his graduation, my stepdaughter refused to invite me. She had two tickets, but she only invited her mother (her grandparents refused as they live in my wife's native country). When I asked why? She said \"You're not my dad, you didn't raise me, and I don't want you in my life\". I was heartbroken, I tried very hard for her to like me but she hated me. Still I paid for her college (I paid for both of my son's colleges as well). \n\nNevertheless, a few months back, she informed my wife that she will be getting married. I only found out, when my wife told me.\n\nWhat was even more devastating is that she said she would come home to celebrate, and I brought a cake, and balloons and so much more. Then, last minute, she changed plans. She just told my wife that she should come over to her apartment, without my sons and I. I was shattered. \n\nWhen I did eventually called to congratulate her, she just tried to end the conversation as quickly as she could. The last thing I had asked was maybe the honor to have a father-daughter dance with her, which she had shot down. \n\nI said nothing, but then came the bill and my wife said she needed some money for her wedding. I considered it long and hard, but clearly as she didn't consider me as her father, I said I would not be paying for her wedding. I told my wife, that she had money saved up, it was her to choice to use that if she wanted, but I would not be paying for her wedding. She was furious at me, she said she barely had any money saved up and I was being an awful person.\n\nI have received calls from all of my wife's family telling me I am being an awful person. The whole thing has become a mess, it has divided our family but I am still holding my ground. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But then I would not have tolerated being disrespected in my home like this. \n\nFor your own self respect man, give her nothing, she is not your kid, never was, never will be.

I never got a mortgage because those things are the devil. We now put money for retirement, emergency money and etc. all into this. Nobody touches this unless its for an emergency or for our kids education.\n5. Business Accounts: On paper some of them are in her name, some are in my name. These are to put back into the business and to continue it. She has a basic grasp of what's in them but its subdivided into accounts for health-insurance, salaries, insurance, profits, new expenditures, external costs, management fees, transport fees, business savings, future-investment account, licensing fees etc. It also includes (Business Futures Accounts) and our stock-portfolio, plus any complicated plans that we can't withdraw money from.

Let\u2019s say that the step daughter has a legitimate reason to not want her step family in her life. (He said that she just wanted the Mom over and not him or her step brothers.) Let\u2019s say it could even be a reason that everyone here would agree that he is TA for. Even in that scenario he would not have to, nor should he pay for his step daughter\u2019s wedding.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t let him come to her graduation\u2014even out of respect for her mother, as her mother\u2019s spouse, and part of the parental team who paid for her college education. She clearly stated through her words and actions that he is not her father and that she doesn\u2019t want him getting anywhere near that role. She doesn\u2019t now get to ask him to provide anything for her wedding. She\u2019s already made it clear she doesn\u2019t want him to be apart of it and there\u2019s a fair chance she will try to ultimately exclude her step family. \n\nNow, adults should never expect anyone to pay for anything for them, because no one is obliged to do so. She is an adult with a college education and no student loans. This is a great position to be in life at a young age. (This is an amazing gift her mother & step father have given her.) Parents can choose to help with the cost of a wedding, but are not obligated to do so. If they have the means and because of their relationship with the child they might choose to contribute some or all of the cost of the wedding, but it comes down to what the parents are willing to do. \n\nOP, I think you need to have a frank discussion with your wife explaining that your step-daughter has chosen to not include you in her life. That is her choice and you will have to respect it. But if you are cut out, that also means she has cut herself off. She doesn\u2019t get to expect you to once again pay for everything. You as parents have set her up well so she can work and save money for her wedding much easier than most her age.\n\nI really want to jump on the bandwagon and say you don\u2019t have to pay a dime, but I can\u2019t. Your wife is your partner and has done the mental and home labor as a part of this marriage so you are right that it isn\u2019t just your money, it\u2019s both of yours. She gets a say in how the money is spent. \n\nWith your wife, you need to consider and discuss some things now to plan for all the children\u2019s weddings. You need to talk about what you would be willing to give as a wedding present. Would you do a separate gift or would the wedding be the gift? (Out of respect to your wife, because that is her daughter and still your step-daughter, you need to plan with her right now what you would be willing to do as a gift and/or budget for each child. I would definitely make this the same amount/thing for each sibling when they get married, because they are still connected to at least one of you. And this should be where the children are treated equally as siblings, regardless if they aren\u2019t getting along with one of the parents.) \n\nIf you are willing to pay for each of your kid\u2019s weddings, how much are you willing to contribute to a wedding? When you set a certain amount, that could be your gift and they can choose to spend it all on the wedding or spend less and save some for married life. But definitely have a set amount that you refuse to go over no matter if the kid really wants \u201cinsert really special wedding thing here.\u201d (Inflation could bump that amount up depending on when the rest get married.) You also need to discuss the money your wife has put away separately. How much is she going to equally give as apart of that gift to each child? If you have to give equally, then so should she. When you are done deciding what you want to do equally for each child, half that amount for your daughter. (Then your share won\u2019t go to a child who has cut herself off from you. She can ask her biological dad for money.)\n\nI know it feels better to just say \u201cnot a dime\u201d but you can\u2019t because you are in a partnership. Especially if you want to keep that partnership. Stand your ground with your half of the gift\u2014she chose to cut herself off. I hope this helps. \n\nNTA", "YTA.

While he provided financially for his stepdaughter we only get his word as to what an amazing stepfather he was, treating them the same and an \"building bridges\" with gifts and paying for stuff... which while important (paying for college) it doesn't guarantee a certain type of relationship.

As far as we know stepdaughter never asked for money, mom/wife did, we don't actually know if she is demanding it or expecting, she might, but we don't hear that at any point.

There is no way as a SAHM that the mom has saved up enough money for an Indian wedding. Still not OP's problem, of course.", "This is deliciously petty and I love it.", "Did any of these men mention the dowry system that is still rampant?\n\n >  It seems rather clear to me that the culture was forcibly shifted less than 100 years ago to adopt  the notion that women had some kind of divine right to men and their money.  \n\nLMAO.. I dunno who you've been talking to, but this is utter bullshit.", "Not through out India. I'm from south India and this is not the norm where I come from. There are many women who've received support from their families after marriage and even  during their divorce n second marriage.", "Oh, I imagine you would disagree with anyone who expresses your exceptional rights as being a net negative to the men you aim to swindle.", "Is it possible that she is resisting letting you in as a father figure because she fears you will leave her just like her dad did?", "That explains it all. Canda, of course", "More like she probably doesn't want him involved with it at all, if her previous actions are a pattern.", "That is what a friend of mine said. He said, it's why she keeps trying to keep you push you away, so you would leave and prove her right.", "You know you're using the same logic as he is right? Saying every Indian is prideful and respectful. You're both generalizing.", "You know you're using the same logic as he is right? Saying every Indian is prideful and respectful. You're both generalizing.", "That might have been the case for the first six months or so.\n\nIt's been 11 years.", "I am saying that Indian Culture expects Indians to be so, not that every one will be like it.", "Sometimes people don't grow out of that pattern without a lot of therapy, there isn't a time limit on this kind of thing. It sounds like the end of OP's wife's marriage was an absolute catastrophe, that kind of trauma can fuck you up for years.", "Just let it go. She doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you.\n\nWhy are you so desperate for her approval. You have three children, focus on them.\n\nYou can not force a relationship in same regards she can not expect your financial contributions as you two are more like strangers. She doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways.\n\nYour Wife is the AH for even suggesting you pay for her wedding. Where is her bio dad.", "I agree that OP needs therapy, his self esteem seems quite low.", "I also would not pay for any sort of party where I was not invited to", "NTA but there are a few red flags... I don't agree with you that your wife has been an amazing mother... An amazing mother wouldn't allow her kid to disrespect the one who is paying the bills for a private school and also an amazing mother would not make an entitled daughter like your step daughter is.", "NTA personnel I think you have went above and beyond for your step daughter already. You didn't even get invited to celebrate her engagement party and she took extra steps to make sure you were there. She alienated you from her life but now she wants your money. All of your in-laws that are calling you, let them pay for her wedding they are invited to I'm sure your not invited so why would you pay. It's easy for them to say your YTA because they don't want to spend their money.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t consider you family, you are not obligated to pay for her wedding", "YTA - it\u2019s not your step daughter asking you to help pay, it\u2019s your wife.", "Hear me out before downvoting me. \n\nYTA because it\u2019s not your money singular, it\u2019s your money plural: you\u2019re not paying for the wedding, your wife would be. \n\nI\u2019ve seen your edits but there\u2019s an awful lot of \u2018me\u2019 \u2018my money\u2019 \u2018wife\u2019s name on HALF the accounts (only because you needed her due to your bad credit). It\u2019s clear you still don\u2019t get it: it\u2019s as much her money as yours. \n\nI get you\u2019re upset but your title is disingenuous and self-centred.", "YTA. You don\u2019t unilaterally control the financial decisions in your family. Your wife is an equal participant, and her family is yours. Bold of you to trade financial support based on keeping score.", "Even Santa would put this stepdaughter on the Naughty List.", "Not only was he NOT her dad, she hated him until she wanted money. Go figure. He\u2019s not an ATM. NTA.", "The ONLY hard part I have about this story is that wife is SAHM and so she may not have been accumulating savings because they had a split income before. It has never been an issue before because they were aligned and their money was shared. But now that stepdaughter (continues) to take advantage of it it cannot be this way anymore.\n\nOP I think you should tell your wife you cannot support her anymore because she has never considered you a father, and not wanting the father-daughter dance or very likely even your attendance is no longer something you can take the pain of. She has access to the accounts - tell her she can gift her daughter however much she thinks she wants to as her daughter, making it clear it is a gift from one person and considering that at least half of the savings are your own. If you have a shared savings account and she wants to deplete half of it on the kid, so be it, but no more than that. \n\nBut you need to make sure that your wife makes it very clear - your daughter has refused you as a father for over a decade, and you are done making attempts. You are not her father and you sure as heck aren't her ATM. Moving forward she is welcome to as much of a relationship with each family member as she wants, but you will make no further attempts to connect. And from now on split savings between you and your wife, even amounts each month, and let her know all children get money from both accounts but daughter gets residuals only from mothers. She has chosen her two parents, so she can get half from her mother and chase down her dad / his family for the rest.", "Exactly this. Her mother clearly didn\u2019t bother saving any money up to pay for her own daughters wedding because she was always intending to use her husband for the money to pay for it all along.", "NTA\n\nshe's made it very clear you are not her father. why would he pay for the wedding of some random girl who grew up in his house?\n\nShe can't have it both ways.", "OP, I have not seen a comment about this yet, so I wanted to speak up on this point, since you seem determined to defend your wife.\n\nYou do not just have step-daughter issues, you have wife issues. The sheer ENTITLEMENT of your wife, that she has the gall to be angry about you refusing financial support to her daughter who has been nothing but disrespectful and borderline abusive toward you (at the bare minimum, she has abused you financially, if not verbally, mentally and emotionally). \n\nYour wife is the mother of her daughter. The onus to fix her daughter's behavior is on her. A blended family is complicated and she cannot force her daughter to love you. However, it is HER job to parent her daughter and make her learn that actions lead to proper consequences.\n\nHer daughter fucked around and is now finding out. Your wife should understand and support your decision, instead of sending flying monkeys your way or letting her family berate you.\n\nPlease, do not pay for this wedding. For one, your step-daughter will be forced to live within her meager means without your backing. As every adult should learn to do. Secondly, if your wife's extended family feel that strongly, they are welcome to fork the money over in payments until the amount is accrued and the wedding can be arranged.\n\nTalk to your wife, because SHE is the source of your problems, not your step-daughter. (Your step-daughter is her own issue, but that is not your circus, not your monkeys.)", "A lot richer if you didn\u2019t pay for college for an ungrateful child", "??? What a weird comment.", "He said his wife\u2019s name is on accounts and he won\u2019t stop her if she goes ahead and pays for wedding , no sympathy for this man anymore.", "I am blessed to have the wealth I possesses. It did not make a significant impact.", "Was a fake account and removed", "Yeah, I checked his comments and saw he's basically defending both his wife and \"his daughter\".\n\nI don't know this man enough to care to dig him out of that hole he has dug for himself. (I know it's callous but sometimes people just will not listen.)", "It smacked of fake.", "But he isn\u2019t the bride\u2019s family.  The bride is quite insistent on this point.", "I was under the impression that in traditional weddings the grooms side has its own pre-wedding celebrations that they cover, the brides side has pre-wedding celebrations that they cover, but then the actual wedding is paid for by the brides family.  No?", "Except that it sounds like paying for the wedding would be a significant hit against their savings. A 400-600 Indian wedding would not be EXPENSIVE. That's not \"solo vacation\" money there. \n\nAnd yes, it's their money. But any expenditures at that level should 100% be agreed on by both of them, and the fact that the daughter is antagonistic and dismissive of OP as a person and a father should be taken into account. OP's wife is expecting him to just take years of insults on the chin and continue paying for her daughter \"just because\".", "Whhhatttt?? I literally told you that you mentioned that the legal system in India allowed some 'divine' right of women on men's property. Did you know women didn't even have the right to her husband's property till he is alive? As in that is not considered her house at all? And if the property she lives in her whole life and works for are her her in laws then she has zero claim like ever? Just few years back were they were given equal right to inheritance of their parents property as an equivalent to male child. \n\nIf you want to continue Please quote a single 'legal' laws in India that would give women right to financial security, as i living in this country have not seen that?\n\n>disagree with anyone who expresses your exceptional rights as being a net negative to the men you aim to swindle.\n\nSwindle???? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I just told you that you were wrong, seems like i touched a nerve. But given that you went from 0 to 100, you look like an Indian spammer you sure acted like one! \n\n\nOP is completely NTA , but that is irrespective of what ever random thing you are talking about!", "She may go along with this to get the checks.\n\nShe WILL tell you to F off and uninvite you from the wedding after the last payment.\n\nBe prepared.", "Won't work. Coerced counseling is counter productive.\n\nShe has stated that she does not consider you her father, so respect that. Drop any attempts to be a father, including paying for this wedding. You are just her mother's husband to her.\n\nLet go of the dream of being her father-figure. She doesn't want it. Tell her that since she has rejected you as a father, you have desire to act as one anymore."]}
