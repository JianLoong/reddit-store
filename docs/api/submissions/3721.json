And of course taking her out to a restaurant sometimes because that's what a 'real man' does for his wife (so much /s here).\n\nBuying ingredients to demand that you cook is obviously not 'buying dinner' because it aint dinner til you've put the labour in to make it dinner. If he thinks bringing home steaks is 'buying dinner' then he can chew on the raw meat. If he's 'bought dinner', let him eat the dinner just as he bought it.\n\nAlso you told him plainly you weren't cooking. That he ignored that and then got angry about it is so domineering, I just can't.\n\nNext point (there's a lot to deal with here) is that you are also expected to clean up. Nahhhhhh. If he can't cook and you can ok fine you can cook. But he can wash a dish and that's exactly what he needs to do if you're cooking.\n\nPosting on social media to complain is just childish and sheer entitlement. For a man in his mid thirties to be posting complaints because his gf didn't jump up and run to the stove when he got home?? My god. \n\nFinal point, you really want *anything* to do with a man whose mother is on your back about not cooking for him because he whinged about it on social media?\n\nHe is absolutely convinced that as a man he deserves to be cooked for by his woman, no matter what.
