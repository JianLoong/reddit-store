Granny can just suck eggs.", "NTA, we were advised when my wife was pregnant not to be lifting heavy items or doing chores where she would be bending often. I'm sure that advice is quite common these days. Don't be so hard on yourself, carrying for 9 months is hard enough as it is.

Your husband\u2019s grandmother sounds like a real peach.", "NTA.  Grandma is of the era where a woman's place is cooking and cleaning.  You guys do things your way.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s grandmother can mind her own business.", "Definitely NTA. I'm 21 weeks and live in a third story apartment. Our stairs are wooden, rickety, narrow, steep, and infested with wasps.. they (stairs) about kill me every day. By the time I get up stairs, I'm breathless and winded. My partner carries the heavy groceries up for me. Eventually I'll have to ask him to carry the laundry, too. He doesn't mind. He just thanks me for doing the grocery shopping and laundry lol. I hate asking him to do things, I've always taken pride in doing stuff myself. But this is our unexpected miracle baby and she's kicking my butt. We're both willing to do whatever it takes.", "NTA I\u2019m not pregnant but do have a bad back and occasionally have crappy balance and trip easily so ask my husband to carry things up and down the stairs all the time.

If your husband is fine with it then I don't see how you would be the asshole.", "NTA", "NTA. This is an arrangement between you and your husband, and his grandmother\u2019s opinion is irrelevant. She might be one of those oldies who does the whole \u201cin my day, I walked through a scorching desert, pregnant and barefoot, to get my drinking water\u201d and so thinks every future generation should have an equally awful existence!", "NTA. It's legit a danger to you and your child. My mom continued to do house chores and lift heavy things when she was pregnant with me, and ended up having an emergency caesarean. I was born very premature and back in those days my chances of survival was very low. Her doc later insinuated that she really should not have exerted herself like that. \n\nMy dad was so freaked by the incident that he never let my mum do a single house chore when she was pregnant with my siblings.

I'm grateful whenever someone is willing to wash and fold my clothes. I would be happy to tote a laundry basket, vacuum or anything else. I'd probably more likely be mad if you tried to do it yourself and not wait for me to help. Follow your instincts and not grandmother's advice on this one.", "NTA. Your friend is stupid. Don\u2019t listen to her.", "NTA, my husband carried so. Many. Things up and down the stairs while I was pregnant. That's just what a supportive, able-bodied husband does, especially when you've fallen down the stairs without being pregnant!", "You don't have to be disabled (or pregnant, for that matter) to not want to do a task. \nAs long he's ok with it, it's all fine. \nNTA", "NTA, Tf.. just for that, call the grandma back and tell her to come over and carry the laundry basket up the stairs for you instead!", "NTA", "NTA.

Its sensible to let your husband help and it's not a big deal.", "NTA I\u2019m short so when I was pregnant it was cumbersome to carry things cause my centre of gravity was off and I doubly couldn\u2019t see my feet. My husband would actually bitch at me when I tried to carry things and remind me I was pregnant to let him", "NTA. It is for you and your baby\u2019s safety. Grandma probably had to deal with an unhelpful grandpa when she was pregnant.", "NTA - you could lose your balance and fall when carrying the basket.  This is absolutely none of her business.", "Nta he's not even the one complaining!  Granny can mind her own potatoes", "NTA. You are being sensible and any reasonable husband would expect to be doing those things. His grandmother has issues which are nothing to do with you.", "NTA\n\nYou don't feel safe doing these things, and it sounds like your husband has no problem doing them. Your husband's grandmother should be glad she took part in raising a considerate partner and not shaming you for knowing your comfort level.", "NTA. If your husband doesn\u2019t mind then that\u2019s all that matters. Your friend should stay out of it.", "No! Of course you wouldn\u2019t be TA! Absolutely ask. I\u2019m 19 weeks pregnant and I have a ton of stairs in my house, my husband always carries stuff up and down the stairs for me. It\u2019s normal to take on more chores when your significant other is 100%.", "NTA. I\u2019m at 28 weeks with my first, and as I was carrying a full laundry basket down the stairs today I thought halfway down that I probably should have asked my wife to do it. No accident this time, but you\u2019re probably smarter than me for asking in the first place! You wouldn\u2019t be TA even if your husband minded slightly, and since he doesn\u2019t you\u2019re really really not. \n\nObviously a healthy pregnancy doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop doing everything, but it does have some real physical limitations. After I finished the laundry today I had to set myself up with a whole new arrangement for folding because whenever I bent over the basket I couldn\u2019t catch my breath. Acknowledging some limitations and asking for easy, willing help is the right thing to do!", "NTA - you're carrying that baby for 9 months, he can carry a few inanimate objects to make your life safer and easier.  I'm sure grandma would have appreciated the help in her day, but sadly that didn't happen.  The \"bless your heart\" response is totally on target, not worth starting a war over.  So glad your hubby is taking good care of you.", "NTA but grandma is right- you are pregnant not disabled. Stay active and healthy. If the basket is heavy, cut the load in half. A healthy pregnancy means staying active and getting exercise! It helps prepare the body for the strenuous act of birth!
