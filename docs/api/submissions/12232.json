I read a lot of stories of the bio mom, sister, dad, brother bought our daughter/son this and my step child feels entitled to the same item, trip, or privileges etc. and they say no they are not. Life isn\u2019t fair. Their family did something for your child and isn\u2019t entitled to do the same for your stepchild. Now people are saying it wasn\u2019t fair to your step child because your sister bought her something. Your wife and stepchild are not entitled to tell you or your sister who or how much money she spends on her niece. Is it fair no. Should you have to match every time your family does something for your daughter, no. If your wife is that upset or concerned she or one of her relatives should fork up the money.", "NAH But theres no way the disparity of the laptops isnt going to cause problems.  You gave both of your daughters extra chores so they could buy their own laptops but only one of them had to actually buy their own laptop.  They both worked for laptops one buys a shitty chromebook with their hard earned budget and the other gets to pay a fraction of the real price just because. This will bring tons of resentment", "Tbh the only A H here is your sister. You and your wife were trying to teach your children the lesson that hard work pays off, and your sister just saunters in and makes the lesson obsolute in the case of your daughter. I dont know if i think you should take the laptop away from her, but you should have a talk with your sister about when its appropriate to give gifts.", "I can understand why your wife is mad and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bc \u201cshe didn\u2019t earn it\u201d I think it\u2019s bc one got something the other didn\u2019t", "NTA.  Your Siblings and or parents  are under no obligation to your stepdaughter.    While it would be nice if they treated your stepkids equally  they don't  have to.    Your daughter might end up with a bigger college fund or a better car then your stepdaughter  but so long as she isn't being mean about it, there usnt much you can do.    You can talk to your family about next time but taking away the laptop or punishing your daughter now will only cause her to resent stepwise and step daughter", "It's hard for me to call you the AH... but you need to have a conversation with your sister and daughter, because your sister ITA.\n\nGiving expensive gifts to minor children without the parent's permission is a violation of boundaries.  It creates disruption in the home.  My MIL buys my kids very expensive presents, but she ALWAYS asks (and she spreads it equally).  If she ever tried to buy 1 a present and exclude the others, I wouldn't have it.\n\nI'm not sure you should take the gift away, but you need to set some boundaries and work through what an expensive gift to one child means to the others.  This is the cost of getting remarried and the unintended impact it has on your children.  If I was your new wife, I'd be annoyed too.", "NTA. It\u2019s not really your daughters fault that she got a fancier laptop so it\u2019s hard to punish her for that.\n\nShould probably talk to your sister though about what your intentions were though", "NTA. You are doing the right thing treating the girls equally. You can't stop your family from giving gift to just your daughter and you can't force them to give equally to your daughter. 14 years old is old enough to learn that life's not fair but you and your wife will always treat them equally.", "NTA.\n\nSince it wasn't your wife or you that made up the difference between $300 and laptop cost, the laptop is now in the realm of not your wife's damn business.\n\nTaking it away will strain you relationship with both your daughter and your sister: you will be disrespecting your sister's choice on how to spend HER money.", "NTA for letting your daughter have the laptop, but Y T A if you don't come up with a solution to fix the disparity between your daughter's laptop and your step-daughter's laptop.  They were both given the same set of rules for buying a laptop, yet your daughter saved less money AND came out with a much more expensive laptop.  How does your step-daughter feel about that?", "[removed]", "This is kind of tough.

That\u2019s life with merging and separation in families. Your wife sounds jealous your sister treated her niece to something.\n\nEdit to add: this is why finances should be stated in the beginning of relationships when mixing kids into it. Each parent should be financially responsible for the child they brought into the relationship. Family as well. I never expect anything from my brothers family when he got gifts.", "she did work for it she put 300 towards it and her aunt gave her the rest to buy a better one so if you wife doesn't like it tough its not hers or yours it belongs to your daughter and her aunt as you both didn't put any money towards it. your wife just jealous she got a better computer", "NAH except for the sister. Maybe. Ngl this is a difficult one, I do understand both sides and this is not a fair situation.\n\nFrankly, while that was nice of her it WAS out of line for her to get her an expensive laptop of all things because it voids the lesson in the case of your daughter to earn it. You should probably talk to your sister about it and see how you can make things fair for your stepdaughter", "NTA - I don\u2019t know what is the relationship between your sister and step daughter, but if your a sister wants to gift her niece something nice and match the laptop\u2019s price, it\u2019s up to her.", "NTA - but I feel like what\u2019s done for 1 kid should be done for all kids, regardless of biological relations. They\u2019re both your daughters so your sister should\u2019ve done for both of them", "YTA. Rules were created with both children in mind, but you allowed an external third party to circumvent the rules. And now that the situation is advantageous to your child, you want to turn a blind eye.", "NTA.  \nBoth of your daughters held up to their end of saving money to purchase a laptop, and both purchased one. \n\nI can understand your wife's anger as her daughter is getting the short end of the stick here by not having any financial help, but she shouldn't be angry with you, nor tell you to take a laptop away. In reality, she should be angry at your sister.\n\nI do think your sister should not have helped, but you do not control her or her wallet, but it really does look unfair to your stepdaughter. Was your sister aware of the deal you made with your daughters? If yes, she should not have stepped in and helped pay, unless she were doing it equally between the two and would really be an AH. If not, then again, she didn't know.\n\nI'd try to find a way to make it fair to your stepdaughter, though.", "YTA for allowing your sister to introduce conflict into your family. She might be generous to her own neice, but those types of favouritism might sour the relationship between your daughter and stepdaughter. You not doing anything is showing who is the preferred daughter and who is not.\n\nYou do not need to take your daughter's laptop away but should return the cromebook and get the same laptop for your stepdaughter. Keep it equal. At 14, your stepdaughter will remember your decision, and so will your wife.", "NAH - but you should talk about it. You should make it right with her daughter. Your sister buying one kid an expensive laptop while the other one worked hard feels wrong.", "It's a really awkward situation: I guess the one question is did the second daughter get her aunt to buy it through pressure or manipulation or did aunt just go, \"Oh it's nothing here I'll get this Alienware for you\"? It kind of defeated the purpose of the whole exercise.\n\nThat being said, she has the laptop now and what is your wife's plan for it if she was to take it away? Let it collect dust? Sure it's a 'gaming' laptop but said laptops are useful for more than just gaming.\n\nFrom what I've seen here you're NTA but your sister shouldn't have purchased it.", "Nta. It was gift and very generous. Sister already got a chromebook and its not like you guys bought it?", "YWBTA if you don't impose some kind of consequence for your daughter's tremendously assholeish behavior. She clearly wheedled her aunt into helping front the cost of the laptop that she wanted. Now, there's nothing wrong with generous aunties, and I won't address the blatant favoritism going on, but holy crap your entire family is garbage for their views on stepkids.\n\nThe thing is, you and your wife had an arrangement with the girls: They pick up extra chores to buy their laptops. Your daughter circumvented that. She didn't earn her laptop. What she did was the same as cheating on a test, pawning chores off on a sibling and taking credit, etc. She should know that this isn't acceptable behavior (though who fucking knows with the circus you're living in, maybe cutting corners is your family's motto) and should have to atone for breaking the agreement. IMO, I'd withhold the laptop until she's completed the number of chores that would equate to the balance of its monetary value. And no, she doesn't need a gaming laptop for school, so if that's an excuse, shove it.", "OP is a joke. My eldest son is NOT my husband's Biological son and his family will CERTAINLY try and pick favorites when it comes to him and his siblings, but as far as my husband is concerned that's his son so for example (my mil bought my daughter a moped scooter type thing) that stays with her in TX and he has also told his mother she needs to buy something (go-kart or something similar) for my eldest to share with his younger brothers or keep it up when he visits her in the summer. I have HALF siblings that family showed favoritism to and we not only have a strained relationship now as adults but the relationship with our mother is Also strained. These are children when you decide to marry someone with kids they become a package deal. With OP's responses he KNOWS it's wrong but doesn't care because it's benefiting his daughter and is refusing to make his step child feel as special. Fucking gross and disgusting how people treat their spouses children.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to take it away but you could definitely at least *try* to find a better solution, like helping your step daughter pay for a nicer computer or talking to your sister ? What kind of lesson do you think you\u2019re teaching here? Are you aware of the divide you\u2019re creating between yourself and your daughter and your wife and her daughter?", "Yes she pulled a dick move so yes she deserves to have something done.", "NTA - but you need to address your family about their preference for your bio daughter over step daughter. As you said yourself, they arent willing to treat both daughters as equal, and thats an issue.", "I wouldn't say u were the asshole but yr daughter pulled an asshole move by getting her aunt to get a gaming laptop for or her when she knew what the deal was. And yes I agree with yr wife she needs some sort of punishment like maybe doing chores without payment for a week or 2", "YTA\n\nYou need to show your stepdaughter you won't accept her being treated as less than. The four of you are a unit, it's time for you as the parents to get the rest of your families onto that same page. And if your sister (or any other family members, for that matter) won't or can't treat both of your children fairly, then they don't need to see *either* of them.", "AH..", "NTA- main reason being that I was a gift from her aunt, so it would kind of be disrespectful to her and her wishes. That being said, it's definitely unfair- one child works harder and ends up with more money as a result, only to get laptop nowhere near as good as the other. Best thing would be to rectify this somehow because chromebooks in general are extremely limiting so it's definitely not fair for her.

Your stepdaughter will feel like she has to work twice as hard for half as much and possibly a resentment towards your daughter while she develops a sense of entitlement.", "Soft ESH.\n\nI don't think you should take the laptop away but I do think you need to have a talk with your sister about the situation she has created at home. You don't know what knowledge your sister is operating under and it's entirely possible she doesn't know what her actions have stirred. \n\nHowever, I do think you're being a deliberately blind in treating your sister's actions as a \"gift\" and acting like her donation to your daughter's laptop is some kind of magic stone that *doesn't* cause ripples when dropped in a pond.\n\nTaking away the laptop won't solve anything but I do think your sister should apologise to you and your wife for creating this situation.\n\nMaybe you can save up and buy stepdaughter some programs or accessories for her laptop equal to the value difference in what your sister supplied in the cost for your daughter's laptop?", "NTA but Wife is a major one, and sister is *kind of* an A-Hole.\n\nSister definitely should have talked to you about helping to pay for the laptop. But IMO Wife is majorly out of line to try and force you to take it away from her. Not to mention the potential for more resentment to build between step daughter and your family if they found out.\n\nIf wife is so concerned about this, then maybe consider working with Step Daughter to return the Chromebook, and then split the cost of a Gaming laptop between you & step daughter like what your sister and daughter did, so that way their back to being equal.\n\nThat said, I'd work on pushing for your family to be nicer to Step Daughter. Also **ASK STEP DAUGHTER HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT THIS**. Don't assume that she's upset when she could be fine, but don't assume she's fine when she could be upset.", "I don't think Y T A but if the girls were to earn it then that is what should have happened. I understand your sister did it but it isn't fair to the other child who got what she earned. This isn't about any of the adults it's about the 2 kids. One worked hard and the other worked harder and the one who worked harder got a slap in the face for it and the other got rewarded. Your sister over stepped here.", "NTA but I would make sure that your daughter doesn\u2019t rub this in her stepsister\u2019s face. If your daughter can be mature about the situation and understand your stepdaughters POV then she should be able to keep it. She still earned a laptop and shouldn\u2019t be blamed for your sister\u2019s financial choices. You should probably alert your family if you ever do something like this again so they won\u2019t buy her the item. Maybe you can set up a way for your daughter to earn the money from your sister? Good luck OP this is tough", "NTA. Your sister bought a gift for her niece. Although it think she should\u2019ve asked you before making the purchase, its not okay for you to be taking it away", "NTA. Let's put it this way- If bio daughter took that 300 with her aunt and got a fancy new bike that aunt chipped in several hundred for would all the commenters be upset? No. So the real problem here is Wife thinks aunt needs to treat the kids fairly when that is not aunts responsibility.", "NTA. Sister should have talked to parents first and I tell my siblings that our kids, whether they are birth, kids through marriage or adoption should be looked at as the same and if they can\u2019t then their interaction is limited. In the end, the aunt gets to come by drop a bomb and let the collateral damage hang out in the house and not have to deal with it. As someone who grew up around all kinds of mixed up family stuff, I\u2019m thankful that no one prefaced a relationship with bio/step/etc. Someone\u2019s kids were their kids and were treated as such.", "Maybe OP could mandate that his daughter pays insurance on her laptop or purchase a care plan since it\u2019s so expensive?", "They both worked hard.       \nThe daughter spent her $300 on the computer the aunt just added extra.", "He may see them both his daughters that doesn\u2019t mean the sister has to see them both at her niece.", "HE chose the package deal.       \nHis family didn\u2019t.", "His sister paid for it.      \nHer money, Her choice how to use it.       \nIf he and his wife buy the stepdaughter a better laptop that would be unfair because both kids wouldn\u2019t be getting equal from the parents.     \nThey can\u2019t make his family spend money on a child they aren\u2019t related to and probably don\u2019t see at family.", "Wow, and that is a sure  way to make biodaughter resent her stepsister by depriving her of her grandparents and aunts and uncles.\nWhat next? If her mother buys her something than she too should be barred from seeing her daughter?", "Of course she\u2019s being favoured.       \nShe\u2019s family.     \nHe chose to marry a woman with a child.      \nHis family had no choice in that, they shouldn\u2019t be forced to stop giving to their niece/granddaughter or to give to someone they didn\u2019t choose to include in their family.", "1. That\u2019s why I listed talking to the sister as a hypothetical compromise\n\n2. They can explain that they\u2019re helping the step daughter because her aunt helped her and they weren\u2019t aware that was going to be happening, very simple \n\n3. I wasn\u2019t suggest the sister buy the step daughter a new laptop? I was suggesting they talk to her about spending so much one girl without even asking the parents or saying something about keeping it low key, since this kind of thing can obviously cause tension (or worse), which will only make the lives of everyone who inhabits that house much harder.", "If they buy the stepdaughter a laptop they are giving more to her than bio daughter.       \nWhat is spent on her by her family should not affect what the parents spend on the kids in the house.            \nThe kids are old enough to realise that one girls extended family doesn\u2019t have to spend money on both.        \nTalk to the sister if they want, but the only way it will change is if she stops spending money on her niece.          \nThat\u2019s not fair to the aunt or the niece.           \nIf somebody tried to control what I spent on my niece or nephew I\u2019d be pissed.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s terribly unreasonable to think that parents should get the final say on large purchases for their own children? And the kids are also old enough to understand that if the initial agreement is you\u2019ll pay for something on your own, and then someone helps you buy it, it\u2019s fair for the other person to get assistance as well, regardless of who it\u2019s from.", "So by this logic OP daughter should not be getting any love from her grandparents as well. She should just discard all relationships, friends, romantic partners who have the potential to make some financial contributions to her life in the spirit of equality with her stepsister.\n\nOP decided to marry someone but his parents and siblings should suffer by being their love and affection and gifts for their granddaughter/niece withheld from her.", "Yes, that\u2019s absolutely what I said. Every time her grandma goes in for a hug she should spit in her face /s\n\nThe leaps of logic you had to make to reach that conclusion are astronomical.", "NTA, your wife does not get to dictate what gifts your family gives to your daughter. She is only mad because it\u2019s nicer than her daughter\u2019s computer. Oh well, life isn\u2019t fair she will get over it.", "NTA", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t take it to prove a point. She saved $300. If she didn\u2019t use that towards the lap too then have it go towards something else she wants or put it in a savings account.", "NTA, and you shouldn\u2019t take the laptop away. The sister is at fault here not your daughter. Regardless how expensive it was, her buying an entire computer for your daughter just because is a bad idea. Instead of punishing your daughter for your sister buying it for her, you should instead talk to your sister and daughter about the situation. I can imagine your step daughter feels upset over this, she worked hard for her laptop and to see her stepsister come home with probably a $1600 laptop isn\u2019t fair to her. Maybe tell your sister if she\u2019s gonna do this again she needs to do it for both kids or don\u2019t do it again because it\u2019s not fair to the other daughter.", "NTA do not take the laptop away from your child", "I\u2019m curious to how people would feel if it was a biological sister over a step? The step mom isn\u2019t mad about the daughter getting a gift over her daughter. It\u2019s they had set up expectations for both girls and one worked for it and the other got it gifted. \n\nI agree NTA but you should definitely talk to your sister. Not because she didn\u2019t get a laptop for both girls but because you had expectations set and she went against them. And even if she didn\u2019t know, big purchases should always be run by the parents first. Especially something that will give his child internet access.", "This...completely agree..OP you're NTA", "This. What do they do about Christmas? Do they tell the respective family members \u201cyou can only spend $X because we want it to be fair.\u201d No\u2026family spends what they want on who they want. OP couldn\u2019t control what his sister chose to spend. Maybe the wife should go to one of her family members and see if they\u2019ll give her daughter what the sister spent on the laptop. My guess is that they\u2019d say she\u2019s was crazy.", ">\tYou should probably alert your family if you ever do something like this again so they won\u2019t buy her the item.\n\nWhy should OP\u2019s daughter be punished for her father\u2019s choice to join a new relationship? Like, why is it the aunt\u2019s responsibility to treat the girls equally when one isn\u2019t related to her at all?", "But we don't know if it was just because.   I feel like there is part of the story missing.   If my kid came home and said \"look what auntie bought me\" I would be having a discussion with auntie asking a) if she bought it and b) what led up to her buying it.   I  love my kids but would want to make sure someone wasn't playing fast and loose with the truth", "That\u2019s not even close to the same thing and you know it. This was a specific agreement between you, your wife, and your daughters.", "Do you really think family harmony is best served by making sure that it's clear to bio-daughter that her life is significantly worse (due to the withdrawal of all other extended support) as a result of having her stepmother and stepsister in it?", "Might not be the worst idea to try to separate the funds, so that there's one for each girl for just money you and your wife put in, and your family puts aside money separately. That way it's more clear that within your nuclear family the contributions are fairly split, while other people can still put aside as much as they like.", "I\u2019m not saying parents shouldn\u2019t get the last say.       \nThey should.        \nI\u2019m saying if the parents buy a new laptop for the stepdaughter that isn\u2019t fair to the bio daughter because what she gets from her extended family should not be counted in what the parents give the girls.       \nThe bio daughter saved $300 and paid that towards the laptop the aunt paid the rest.       \nShe still worked for the money, she didn\u2019t get it completely for free.        \nThe aunt just paid the difference.            \nIt would be good to say the laptop is both birthday and Christmas present from the aunt and her not get anything more for the year.       \nThe stepdaughter is going to have to learn that her step family aren\u2019t going to spend the same on her as their niece/granddaughter.        \nIt sucks, but the mother needs to deal with it and tell her daughter she\u2019s not entitled to stuff from them.      \nThat she can\u2019t make them spend the same on her as her stepsister and she needs to get used to it.       \nIf they try to force the extended family to spend the same on the stepdaughter as the bio daughter they\u2019ll end up pushing them away and will eventually lose the daughter because of it.             \nBio daughter shouldn\u2019t have to say no to a present just because her stepsister isn\u2019t getting the same.", "Okay OP: don't take the laptop away.\n\nMy parents seperated when I was two and divorced when I was 4. My half sister was born when I was 9.\n\nMy dad's side of the family is large and not entirely not well off. Because of divorce, I got two Christmases, Two birthdays, Two Easters, etc. My mother was adopted and her adopted family sucked shit. My step dad's mom unfortunately passed away before my sister was born, and the rest of my step dad's family has issues. TL;DR I got better gifts from my dad's side of the family.\n\nMy mom got mad at one point and refused to let me see my dad's side of the family because it wasn't \"fair,\" to my sister who's father was the guy my mom left my dad for.\n\nMy dad's family was under no obligation to include my half sister in celebrations. Your sister is under no obligation to court your stepdaughter.\n\nHowever, two ideas- You could talk to your daughter about maybe getting her step sister some kind of accessory for her laptop. a mouse, a case, speakers, etc. Something. Or inviting her sister out and treating her because that's what sisters do. Or you and your wife could do something like that for her. Either way it's kind of acknowledging your stepdaughter getting her laptop in the way you laid out for the kids.", "NTA", "NTA I think it was generous too.  Your wife should of got her sibs to take the step shopping.  See what happens.  That is sad that your wife is begrudging your daughter like that.  So if she had found a better deal, would it still of been unfair?", "I meaaaan this really isn\u2019t that, though.\n\nI\u2019m from a broken/blended situation as well but it was my stepmother\u2019s family that had money which meant that my stepsister (who was always treated equally by my dad\u2019s family) was taken to Disneyland and was sent to private school (etc, etc) while my brother and I were made to understand that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it was my stepmother/stepmother\u2019s family paying for those things.
