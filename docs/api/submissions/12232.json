I read a lot of stories of the bio mom, sister, dad, brother bought our daughter/son this and my step child feels entitled to the same item, trip, or privileges etc. and they say no they are not. Life isn\u2019t fair. Their family did something for your child and isn\u2019t entitled to do the same for your stepchild. Now people are saying it wasn\u2019t fair to your step child because your sister bought her something. Your wife and stepchild are not entitled to tell you or your sister who or how much money she spends on her niece. Is it fair no. Should you have to match every time your family does something for your daughter, no. If your wife is that upset or concerned she or one of her relatives should fork up the money.", "NAH But theres no way the disparity of the laptops isnt going to cause problems.  You gave both of your daughters extra chores so they could buy their own laptops but only one of them had to actually buy their own laptop.  They both worked for laptops one buys a shitty chromebook with their hard earned budget and the other gets to pay a fraction of the real price just because. This will bring tons of resentment", "Tbh the only A H here is your sister. You and your wife were trying to teach your children the lesson that hard work pays off, and your sister just saunters in and makes the lesson obsolute in the case of your daughter. I dont know if i think you should take the laptop away from her, but you should have a talk with your sister about when its appropriate to give gifts.", "I can understand why your wife is mad and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bc \u201cshe didn\u2019t earn it\u201d I think it\u2019s bc one got something the other didn\u2019t", "NTA.  Your Siblings and or parents  are under no obligation to your stepdaughter.    While it would be nice if they treated your stepkids equally  they don't  have to.    Your daughter might end up with a bigger college fund or a better car then your stepdaughter  but so long as she isn't being mean about it, there usnt much you can do.    You can talk to your family about next time but taking away the laptop or punishing your daughter now will only cause her to resent stepwise and step daughter", "It's hard for me to call you the AH... but you need to have a conversation with your sister and daughter, because your sister ITA.\n\nGiving expensive gifts to minor children without the parent's permission is a violation of boundaries.  It creates disruption in the home.  My MIL buys my kids very expensive presents, but she ALWAYS asks (and she spreads it equally).  If she ever tried to buy 1 a present and exclude the others, I wouldn't have it.\n\nI'm not sure you should take the gift away, but you need to set some boundaries and work through what an expensive gift to one child means to the others.  This is the cost of getting remarried and the unintended impact it has on your children.  If I was your new wife, I'd be annoyed too.", "NTA. It\u2019s not really your daughters fault that she got a fancier laptop so it\u2019s hard to punish her for that.\n\nShould probably talk to your sister though about what your intentions were though", "NTA. You are doing the right thing treating the girls equally. You can't stop your family from giving gift to just your daughter and you can't force them to give equally to your daughter. 14 years old is old enough to learn that life's not fair but you and your wife will always treat them equally.", "NTA.\n\nSince it wasn't your wife or you that made up the difference between $300 and laptop cost, the laptop is now in the realm of not your wife's damn business.\n\nTaking it away will strain you relationship with both your daughter and your sister: you will be disrespecting your sister's choice on how to spend HER money.", "NTA for letting your daughter have the laptop, but Y T A if you don't come up with a solution to fix the disparity between your daughter's laptop and your step-daughter's laptop.  They were both given the same set of rules for buying a laptop, yet your daughter saved less money AND came out with a much more expensive laptop.  How does your step-daughter feel about that?", "People like her like to talk \"fair\".    How long have you been married?   Did you ask your daughters permission to marry the kind of JERK who thinks she owns the right to dictate what gifts your sister is or isn't allowed to buy her niece?  The kind of AH who would take her gift away? So unfair.", "This is kind of tough. I don't think you should take it away, but it would definitely make you look like you're giving preferential treatment. Maybe see if there's a way to give the other daughter something to make up for it. Ultimately NTA.", "NTA your sister bought her niece a gift, I buy my niece and nephew expensive gifts that stay at moms. They have siblings at dads house that do not get the same things. That\u2019s life with merging and separation in families. Your wife sounds jealous your sister treated her niece to something.\n\nEdit to add: this is why finances should be stated in the beginning of relationships when mixing kids into it. Each parent should be financially responsible for the child they brought into the relationship. Family as well. I never expect anything from my brothers family when he got gifts.", "she did work for it she put 300 towards it and her aunt gave her the rest to buy a better one so if you wife doesn't like it tough its not hers or yours it belongs to your daughter and her aunt as you both didn't put any money towards it. your wife just jealous she got a better computer", "NAH except for the sister. Maybe. Ngl this is a difficult one, I do understand both sides and this is not a fair situation.\n\nFrankly, while that was nice of her it WAS out of line for her to get her an expensive laptop of all things because it voids the lesson in the case of your daughter to earn it. You should probably talk to your sister about it and see how you can make things fair for your stepdaughter", "NTA - I don\u2019t know what is the relationship between your sister and step daughter, but if your a sister wants to gift her niece something nice and match the laptop\u2019s price, it\u2019s up to her.", "NTA - but I feel like what\u2019s done for 1 kid should be done for all kids, regardless of biological relations. They\u2019re both your daughters so your sister should\u2019ve done for both of them", "YTA. Rules were created with both children in mind, but you allowed an external third party to circumvent the rules. And now that the situation is advantageous to your child, you want to turn a blind eye.", "NTA.  \nBoth of your daughters held up to their end of saving money to purchase a laptop, and both purchased one. \n\nI can understand your wife's anger as her daughter is getting the short end of the stick here by not having any financial help, but she shouldn't be angry with you, nor tell you to take a laptop away. In reality, she should be angry at your sister.\n\nI do think your sister should not have helped, but you do not control her or her wallet, but it really does look unfair to your stepdaughter. Was your sister aware of the deal you made with your daughters? If yes, she should not have stepped in and helped pay, unless she were doing it equally between the two and would really be an AH. If not, then again, she didn't know.\n\nI'd try to find a way to make it fair to your stepdaughter, though.", "YTA for allowing your sister to introduce conflict into your family. She might be generous to her own neice, but those types of favouritism might sour the relationship between your daughter and stepdaughter. You not doing anything is showing who is the preferred daughter and who is not.\n\nYou do not need to take your daughter's laptop away but should return the cromebook and get the same laptop for your stepdaughter. Keep it equal. At 14, your stepdaughter will remember your decision, and so will your wife.", "NAH - but you should talk about it. You should make it right with her daughter. Your sister buying one kid an expensive laptop while the other one worked hard feels wrong.", "It's a really awkward situation: I guess the one question is did the second daughter get her aunt to buy it through pressure or manipulation or did aunt just go, \"Oh it's nothing here I'll get this Alienware for you\"? It kind of defeated the purpose of the whole exercise.\n\nThat being said, she has the laptop now and what is your wife's plan for it if she was to take it away? Let it collect dust? Sure it's a 'gaming' laptop but said laptops are useful for more than just gaming.\n\nFrom what I've seen here you're NTA but your sister shouldn't have purchased it.", "Nta. It was gift and very generous. Sister already got a chromebook and its not like you guys bought it?", "YWBTA if you don't impose some kind of consequence for your daughter's tremendously assholeish behavior. She clearly wheedled her aunt into helping front the cost of the laptop that she wanted. Now, there's nothing wrong with generous aunties, and I won't address the blatant favoritism going on, but holy crap your entire family is garbage for their views on stepkids.\n\nThe thing is, you and your wife had an arrangement with the girls: They pick up extra chores to buy their laptops. Your daughter circumvented that. She didn't earn her laptop. What she did was the same as cheating on a test, pawning chores off on a sibling and taking credit, etc. She should know that this isn't acceptable behavior (though who fucking knows with the circus you're living in, maybe cutting corners is your family's motto) and should have to atone for breaking the agreement. IMO, I'd withhold the laptop until she's completed the number of chores that would equate to the balance of its monetary value. And no, she doesn't need a gaming laptop for school, so if that's an excuse, shove it.", "OP is a joke. My eldest son is NOT my husband's Biological son and his family will CERTAINLY try and pick favorites when it comes to him and his siblings, but as far as my husband is concerned that's his son so for example (my mil bought my daughter a moped scooter type thing) that stays with her in TX and he has also told his mother she needs to buy something (go-kart or something similar) for my eldest to share with his younger brothers or keep it up when he visits her in the summer. I have HALF siblings that family showed favoritism to and we not only have a strained relationship now as adults but the relationship with our mother is Also strained. These are children when you decide to marry someone with kids they become a package deal. With OP's responses he KNOWS it's wrong but doesn't care because it's benefiting his daughter and is refusing to make his step child feel as special. Fucking gross and disgusting how people treat their spouses children.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to take it away but you could definitely at least *try* to find a better solution, like helping your step daughter pay for a nicer computer or talking to your sister ? What kind of lesson do you think you\u2019re teaching here? Are you aware of the divide you\u2019re creating between yourself and your daughter and your wife and her daughter?", "Yes she pulled a dick move so yes she deserves to have something done.", "NTA - but you need to address your family about their preference for your bio daughter over step daughter. As you said yourself, they arent willing to treat both daughters as equal, and thats an issue.", "I wouldn't say u were the asshole but yr daughter pulled an asshole move by getting her aunt to get a gaming laptop for or her when she knew what the deal was. And yes I agree with yr wife she needs some sort of punishment like maybe doing chores without payment for a week or 2", "YTA\n\nYou need to show your stepdaughter you won't accept her being treated as less than. The four of you are a unit, it's time for you as the parents to get the rest of your families onto that same page. And if your sister (or any other family members, for that matter) won't or can't treat both of your children fairly, then they don't need to see *either* of them.", "AH..", "NTA- main reason being that I was a gift from her aunt, so it would kind of be disrespectful to her and her wishes. That being said, it's definitely unfair- one child works harder and ends up with more money as a result, only to get laptop nowhere near as good as the other. Best thing would be to rectify this somehow because chromebooks in general are extremely limiting so it's definitely not fair for her.
