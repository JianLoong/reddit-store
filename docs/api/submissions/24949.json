The thing is, job hunting these days is a shit ton of work, and when you\u2019re already stressed and depressed at your current job, the thought of taking on that work - even knowing it could lead to something better - is *daunting* and at times even impossible, no matter how many check lists there are. \n\nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this. I stayed in an exhausting job a year longer than I wanted to because job hunting only added to my misery. You won\u2019t be able to reach her until she\u2019s ready to take on the extra load. It could take months. Instead of coming at her with resume tips and helpful suggestions that add to the mental load, spend time talking with her and asking her what she actually wants. She may not know! Acknowledge where she\u2019s at now. And if you\u2019re struggling to listen, acknowledge that too.", "> I asked her if she is editing her resume for keywords in the job description and if she is **messaging hiring managers and she said no.**\n\nBAD ADVICE BAD ADVICE BAD ADVICE. Messaging hiring managers is an awful idea. It's annoying to them and signals that you're too incompetent or self-important to follow basic procedures. If you're telling your girlfriend she isn't doing enough to find jobs while actively making her job search worse, I don't know if you're an asshole, but you're definitely being a dumbass\n\nThe rare, rare exceptions are if you have a personal or professional connection with them or if there is some kind of extenuating circumstance where you have reason to believe they would be (positively) aware of you in specific.\n\nE: To clarify, you can message *recruiters*, whose job is to talk to you and plug you into jobs, but you absolutely should not message hiring managers at the companies you are applying for in an attempt to \"get your name out there\" to jump the queue on the application process.", "YTA (with a good intentions tho)\nShe did vent because she is stressed. She is worried, has for sure already a lot on her mind, maybe anxiety because of the project that will interfere with the holidays and... your concern is her finding a new job?\n\nDude, honestly, I get your good intent but like, no. She probably knows already she isn't putting enough effort without you reminding her about. The intention to offer her the laptop or the help is indeed good and kind, but... Have you asked her what ***she needs*** (from you)? Instead of offering her a solution or telling her what to do or that you will support her in this and that and that other way... Ask her what she needs. What she wants. Like \"do you want me to help you or do you just wanna rant/vent?\" Or like \"what do you want, how can I help you, how can I support you the best?\" ... That are really helpful things to do when one is probably overwhelmed with everything.", "An unintentional YTA. I am generalizing here, but us guys usually like to just SOLVE the problem. That's where you were coming from, I'm assuming, and I can't fault you too much, but sometimes you just gotta listen. It's probably stressful to hear that your girl goes through all this, I totally get it. But telling you about it can be a stress reliever. Just be there for her, and you guys will be fine.", "YTA she wants to vent not get yelled at by you for not doing your bad advice.  Also, of course she makes less than the people who have a PhD. That's why people get degrees. Even if it's the same job, degree holders make more.", "Hard to tell, but sounds like YTA.\n\nIt's rarely easy to make a change, and it seems the deal is that she can't really vent to you about her shite job unless she can also demonstrate to you that she has done enough, in your estimation, to change her situation.\n\nSounds pretty shitty to me.", "tiny YTA. Yes, youre right about her not putting enough effort. As tedious as it is, you have to slightly change your CV depending on the job youre aplying for, according to the skills they look for, and also message the recruters. But you could have been more supportive. Maybe offer to go over her CV with her and edit it together. Or send her some RECENT job offers you find on LinkedIn or some other platform. In theory maybe that wont do shit, but she will feel supported which will motivate her to put more effort into her search.", "Shes probably not putting in \"much effort\" because she CAN'T. Stress and anxiety takes alot of energy and so does her job, which she probably has to put all remaining energy into since, as you said, she's overworked. Instead, you should help her (more than just giving her a laptop, apply for jobs for her if you can or something more active) or let her go at her own pace", "NAH. \n\nNext time, try this: \"Do you want advice or do you want to vent?\" \n\nLet her tell you what she needs and give her that.", "Sounds like you need to offer to help get an attorney for a harassment suit, not do job apps for her.", "NAH. Your intentions are good. Your approach wasn't. Sit down with her at the computer and show her what you mean about key words in her resume. That way, you are helping, not critcising.", "NTA - she should write everything down- dates and details of the incidents, download emails on a usb - follow every conversation up with an email recap of what was discussed and contact an attorney specializing in labor law. HR is not there for her - it\u2019s function is to protect the company. They clearly want her to leave- an attorney can help make sure she does it on her terms and with a severance package. Good luck to her.", "NTA. It is extremely frustrating and exhausting when someone keeps venting at you and does nothing to improve their situation. It will poison your relationship if you let it. I would start gently changing the subject after a few minutes. If she won't let it go make an excuse - or say that you aren't in a place to deal and end that conversation. Email her job opportunities if you see them etc. but you aren't her ESA", "NTA. If she is applying to other places she clearly wants a change. You're offering help and resources which is nice of you.\n\nYeah I'm sure she's exhausted but if you're going to randomly send in a generic resume everywhere and not get called back there's more work that needs to be done to refine that resume.", "NTA.  She wants to vent and feel that she is being listened to. She does not want to solve a problem (i.e., find a new job) which, candidly, she could take some actions on during her non-working hours. You're in a no-win situation because anything you suggest will be interpreted as meaning that she is not being heard.\n\nMaybe you and she could use a date night to review and to update her resume.  Better yet, maybe a third party mentor could be brought in to work with her. But my advice: stop trying to help unless she asks you to do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When it was my  late partner he just found he had to leave his old work place so he had the mental energy and freedom to concentrate on a job search .
