My mom - who paid for a good chunk of the wedding - basically invited my aunt the the rehersal dinner and told us after the fact.\n\nWhen I approached my fianc\u00e9,  she pushed back aggressively. Her issue is with my 21-year-old cousin with Down Syndrome. Said cousin's issues sort of go beyond that, though - said cousin is extremely poorly-behaved. Most of her life, she has been the center of attention and tends to make every situation about herself. Further, my fianc\u00e9 informed me that said cousin has also called her ugly and insulted how she dresses. Said cousin also tends to burp and fart out of place and laughs about it.\n\nSaid cousin said the same kind of rude things to me, but I've learned to deal with it over the years. For example, during a phase in her teenage years, she started telling everybody I was her boyfriend, and when I asked her to stop, her new nickname for me was \"stinky butt\" - that's all she calls me now.\n\nSaid cousin has a defiant personality and is rude beyond what I think is acceptable even for someone with Down Syndrome.\n\nBut her words do tend to hurt my fianc\u00e9. Just last year during the toast at another wedding for a distant cousin, she took the mic and rambled for like five minutes (this was not a close family member and I'm not even sure the couple knew who she was), which was a cringeworthy moment of an otherwise lovely ceremony.\n\nI explained the situation to my mom and asked her to tell my aunt's family not to come to the rehersal dinner, but are still welcome to come to the reception. I explained my concerns about said cousin's behavior. I brought up boundaries, and she started crying. I brought up that earlier this year I had COVID on my birthday and my mom insisted on coming over. After I said no four times and I just wanted to be alone, she came over anyway.\n\nShe responded by passive-agressively saying, \"Well if you have to choose between family and your wife, you have to honor your wife's wishes\" and said something about not seeing us anymore.\n\nMind you we are not particularly close to this aunt.\n\nI just dont want a cousin calling me \"stinky butt\" on my wedding day... or farting and chuckling about it during the ceremony.... and I especially don't want her telling my bride shes ugly or making fun of her dress on her wedding day.\n\nI was able to convince all parties that said cousin can come, but she must leave the first instant she acts up. What I'm afraid of right now is that there might be disagreement of what \"acting up\" is. I'm almost 100% sure said cousin is going to do something that will allow me to ask my aunt to take her home. And I will. At that point, all sides will think I'm an asshole.

Let them know you're doing them the courtesy of letting them know the level of respectful behaviour you'd like to experience at your wedding and if they have a problem with it, they needn't attend at all, then hold the line.

Did she really think that you simply missed inviting them? Is she so timid she can't tell your aunt no?\n\nMy mother did something like this once. A cousin (who I never cared for in the first place) invited herself along on a vacation to Disney World that was supposed to be just me & my mom. \n\nOnce we were there, she wanted us to go all the way to Miami before going home. She told me she wanted to see an old flame. She told my mom she had a job interview there. Narrator: \"she did not.\" \n\nWhat she didn't realize is that we'd compare notes. No, we did not drive another 8 hours round trip. We made her call the place she wanted to interview at. The person she would have needed to see was on vacation herself. \n\nI have regretted for 30 years that I didn't put my foot down and tell her she was not welcome.

Based on how she treats your wife - as in one bad comment then she is disinvited from the reception. Personally I'd just do a special lunch or dinner and treat your cousin to everything she wants - buy her a dress she wants,  make it about her even though its for your wedding and then say she cant come to reception as this was the one on one celebration of the wedding you have done with her.\n\nTBH she shouldn't be at the reception as you know what will happen and your wife doesnt deserve this.

The problem is she seems determined to insult and upset specific people, she does what she wants to do and her caregivers don\u2019t stop her. That\u2019s the key thing.

In fact your mum and aunt seem to enable it. You do need to choose between your family and your wife. Your future wife who knows how to behave in public or your family who will happily let your cousin behave as badly as she wants. \n\nYTA for not stopping this situation unfolding.", "No, I just have a lovely family myself \ud83d\ude02", "You already have multiple reasons so why would they care if you get more? Support your fiance and stick with the original plan", "I don't like that plan at all.  You know why? Because you *invited* her to the wedding all along. Now you're using the event that she wasn't invited to as some sort of test/excuse to get her completely thrown out of the one that **you invited her to**.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know that the invite was probably due to fAmILy, and your mum shouldn't have invited the aunt to the extra dinner so that's on her, but your cousin has been failed enough by the adults here.  You don't need to be extra cruel by forcing her to take a test she won't possibly pass all so you and your fianc\u00e9e can prove a point.\n\nIs the cousin's behavior okay? No, it's not.  But you knew the history of that behavior when you invited her to your wedding in the first place.  Your talk now of not wanting to be called \"stinky butt\" or be burped/farted on on your wedding day was always in the cards because you invited her to the wedding.\n\nThis isn't some rando cousin's MAGA boyfriend who no one knows and comes in the night before the wedding, gets drunk and gropes a bridesmaid at the RD.  This is behavior you all grew up with and even knowing this behavior, you invited her to the wedding anyway.\n\nNow, just b/c your mum invited her to the rehearsal dinner (which traditionally the groom's family pays for), you're treating this situation like an escape pod.  She's going to fail that test, we all know she's going to fail that test, your cousins whose wedding she disrupted last year know she's going to fail that test.\n\nFuck, man, if she was alive, even Helen Keller would've seen this coming.\n\nYour cousin -- and the behavior that is most definitely not okay but at least normalized by the entire family to this point where it wasn't a concern when the invites were going out -- is going to \"ruin\" your rehearsal dinner by simply *existing*.  There's literally no way she won't fail because you cannot possibly change your entire personality in a single night.  Poor girl will either fuck it up in all the normal ways or she'll be so anxious she'll be walking on eggshells all night and fuck it up that way.  Either way, based on your comments here, you'll be waiting and watching with baited breath all night just looking for that chance to publicly declare her \"unwelcome\" the next day for behavior ***that you knew would be on the table when you invited her to your wedding***.  So when she does and you're running around gleefully enforcing these new goal posts that you set because you saw the chance to (finally) exclude her \"for reasons,\" you're going to look like a complete asshole because while your excuse is that you don't want to be \"humiliated on your wedding day,\" that's a situation that you could've controlled 6-8 weeks ago and not with a grand gesture 6-8 hours before the wedding when the entire family is assembled to watch the takedown.", "YTA", "Yeah, it feels like OP wants to humiliate their cousin at the rehearsal dinner, and it's just cruel.

Your aunt and uncle failed to teach her proper social etiquette, and now that she is an adult, they still expect her to get a free pass when she behaves poorly?!

Either she doesnt come, and if she does, she will ruin every single event, and it will take a huge toll on your marriage. Also, her behavior is not because of her down syndrome, it is because of her parents enabling. Special needs kids, if taught to be polite , might ocassionally misbehave, but not ALL the time.
