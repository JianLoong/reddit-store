{"id": 28941, "submission_id": "1785e6o", "title": "AITA - Not wanting my adult cousin with Down Syndrome to attend my wedding rehearsal dinner?", "selftext": "I'm getting married this week.\n\nMy aunt, who is not out of town and is not in the wedding contacted my mom asking if it was a mistake that her family only got an invitation to the wedding, and not the rehersal dinner. My mom - who paid for a good chunk of the wedding - basically invited my aunt the the rehersal dinner and told us after the fact.\n\nWhen I approached my fianc\u00e9,  she pushed back aggressively. Her issue is with my 21-year-old cousin with Down Syndrome. Said cousin's issues sort of go beyond that, though - said cousin is extremely poorly-behaved. Most of her life, she has been the center of attention and tends to make every situation about herself. Further, my fianc\u00e9 informed me that said cousin has also called her ugly and insulted how she dresses. Said cousin also tends to burp and fart out of place and laughs about it.\n\nSaid cousin said the same kind of rude things to me, but I've learned to deal with it over the years. For example, during a phase in her teenage years, she started telling everybody I was her boyfriend, and when I asked her to stop, her new nickname for me was \"stinky butt\" - that's all she calls me now.\n\nSaid cousin has a defiant personality and is rude beyond what I think is acceptable even for someone with Down Syndrome.\n\nBut her words do tend to hurt my fianc\u00e9. Just last year during the toast at another wedding for a distant cousin, she took the mic and rambled for like five minutes (this was not a close family member and I'm not even sure the couple knew who she was), which was a cringeworthy moment of an otherwise lovely ceremony.\n\nI explained the situation to my mom and asked her to tell my aunt's family not to come to the rehersal dinner, but are still welcome to come to the reception. I explained my concerns about said cousin's behavior. I brought up boundaries, and she started crying. I brought up that earlier this year I had COVID on my birthday and my mom insisted on coming over. After I said no four times and I just wanted to be alone, she came over anyway.\n\nShe responded by passive-agressively saying, \"Well if you have to choose between family and your wife, you have to honor your wife's wishes\" and said something about not seeing us anymore.\n\nMind you we are not particularly close to this aunt.\n\nI just dont want a cousin calling me \"stinky butt\" on my wedding day... or farting and chuckling about it during the ceremony.... and I especially don't want her telling my bride shes ugly or making fun of her dress on her wedding day.\n\nI was able to convince all parties that said cousin can come, but she must leave the first instant she acts up. What I'm afraid of right now is that there might be disagreement of what \"acting up\" is. I'm almost 100% sure said cousin is going to do something that will allow me to ask my aunt to take her home. And I will. At that point, all sides will think I'm an asshole.

I\u2019m a special education teacher and if your cousin was a disruption in my class, I would have  a behavioral plan in place for her. If her parents do not have any such plan in place, then they will all unfortunately suffer the consequences.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re inviting because she has Down\u2019s syndrome. You aren\u2019t inviting because her general behavior is unacceptable. Most people with downs behave acceptably. In fact I\u2019ve never met a person with downs that couldn\u2019t function like anyone else.", "NTA if I was in your shoes I\u2019d let them come to the rehearsal dinner. Let them know that if your cousin acts up she will be asked to leave immediately and will be barred from returning to any of the festivities, including the ceremony and the reception. I\u2019d then hope she acts up at the rehearsal so you can just ban her outright and not have to stress about it. \n\nIf they\u2019re banned make sure the bridal party is on alert so they can take care of the situation and you can enjoy your day. Congratulations on the nuptials!", "NTA. I wouldn't even take the chance. It's your rehearsal dinner. It is not your mom's.", "NTA, you aren't excluding the cousin for the disability, you are excluding someone for being incredibly and consistently rude.", "NTA. Your mother had no business inviting ANYONE to your rehearsal dinner. You don't need to get into the why's or wherefores. They are irrelevant.\n\nRehearsal dinners are for the wedding party, extremely close family and occasionally a few other people the happy COUPLE choose to invite. Not for rarely seen aunts and cousins or any randos the MOG decides to invite without consulting the couple.\n\nYou should have shut your mother down immediately without ever taking it to your fiancee. Damn straight you should have sided with your fiancee.", "NTA .... and be sure to send cousin home at the start of the drama.  Tell your mum and your aunt that you expect them to handle the exit quickly and quietly with no argument or discussion.   You will not have your wedding day disrupted by cousin or anyone else.\n\nIf aunt has a problem with this .... then she shouldn't come.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have caved. Your cousin sounds like a horrible brat.", "NTA. This is kind of like asking for 'no kids' at your wedding, its pretty reasonable. You can pick who you want to attend or who you don't want to attend.", "Info: is the rehearsal dinner otherwise pretty limited?  You do not have to invite everyone coming to the wedding to the rehearsal dinner.  You don\u2019t need a reason.  \n\nYou aren\u2019t excluding her from the wedding or reception - these are two separate things.", "NTA.  And not that you would/should say anything to her about it, but at the end of the day the reason your cousin isn't invited is your Aunt.  Basic etiquette and common decency are taught to you or learned by example, especially with someone who has a learning deficit.  Your aunt dropped the ball somewhere, I don't want to type-cast anyone but anything I've heard about people with down syndrome from my DSP friends is the exact opposite of the behavior you described here. \n\nI just wanted to mention the part about you not wanting your fiancee to be called ugly on her special day was really heart warming.  Wishing you both the best of health & marriage.", "NTA Really though, the rehearsal dinner is supposed to be a final celebration of the WEDDING PARTY to get together for one last meal after rehearsal and before the wedding. It\u2019s also a thank you from the bride and groom for all of their support leading up to that day. Guests will see everyone the next day. They should never have been invited. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t want her at my wedding much less at the rehearsal. Mom was wrong.", "Nta that should be for the wedding party plus their spouses.", "Isn't the woman who will be your wife your family too? Your mom is reaching with this. NTA. \"My wedding should need bouncers at the door mom!\"", "Nta  definitely.  Down syndrome does not mean bad behaviour.  That was  parent problem now manifested to a brat. \n\n  We had the most gorgeous young man as a volunteer at a workplace a few years ago.   We found that when we said ' no George you can't  do/say/ touch whatever, he was ok. Sometimes a bit of explanation,  but all good.", "NTA. And you know who won\u2019t think you are an asshole?  Your bride. She will be happy that you used your shiny spine and steps up for her.", "Came in expecting you to be the ah. But this is definitely NTA territory.", "NTA.", "INFO - is the cousin actually invited to the wedding? If yes, why?", "No two people with Downs Syndrome are going to behave in the same way; there's variation in terms of ability and disability. She may also have ASD and/or other disorders in addition to DS (it's very common). \n\nBut it's obvious this person has a pronounced intellectual disability so I'm a bit surprised you and your soon to be wife is getting offended...I mean, come on.", "NTA because the rehearsal dinner is not about everyone attending and most kids (ie people that need supervision) aren\u2019t invited, but the things your fianc\u00e9 is saying about your cousin are disgusting and ableist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
