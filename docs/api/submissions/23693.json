She never said or did anything to my wife or me and could hurt my wife) later my mom told me all about it on phone, how embarrassed she felt.\n\nI confronted my wife about it, and she said I am overreacting and that my mom also needs to open up.\n\nAm I the asshole here to tell my wife this?\n\nPS. Based on the comments that I am getting, It seems people can even justify that If my wife decided to go totally naked in public, Then also people will judge me for asking her to dress normally?

Your wife has little respect for your mother or her discomfort. She likes to shock your mother and doesn't care she's making your mum uncomforable. She doesn't have the maturity as yet to truly appreciate that others are more conservative and that's OKAY.  She will justify it by saying your mother needs to losen up and women can do whatever they want with their own body. That woman can wear what they want, where they want blah blah blah....you  know, today younger women vibe.  You wife will NOT change, maybe when she's in her 40s & 50s she'll realise what a selfish git she was...but that realisation and maturity is some years away yet.\n\nI have no real suggestions.

It\u2019s far more likely she\u2019s trying to show your Mum she\u2019s comfortable with her. You said she went shopping with her, trying to bond. But she has no way of knowing this made your mother uncomfortable, because she said NOTHING to her about it. How is that conducive to a good relationship between them?\n\nInstead of coming to reddit looking for people to agree with you, maybe give your wife the benefit of the doubt, and the chance to discuss this with you like an adult!", "It sounds like all 3 of you are the assholes here", "YTA. Defend your wife and tell your mom to mind her own business and body.", "There's a lot going on with this dynamic with your mom, you and your wife, and it's not all about clothes...\n\nFirstly, your wife dressed like this when you married her right? Isn't there some value to accepting your partner for who they are..?\n\nWhy was it ok by you for her to wear these clothes at the beginning of your marriage when you named feeling like it was for you and the same behavior isn't ok now? \n\nWhat do YOU feel about it and why?? \n\nNot your mom - this is YOUR relationship.\n\nWhat's changed with how you feel about your wife's style recently and why? \n\nWhat does your wife feel? If your wife has in fact had a recent, drastic change on her end, you should ask her to learn more about where it may be coming from emotionally.  Is she going through a mid life crisis? Does she feel validated with these clothes? Does she just think they're cute? Are they just a new style for women? Is she (still) wearing them for you? Is she coming into her own feeling herself in her body in a new way? Hearing from her why she is expressing herself this way is extremely important before jumping to conclusions. It may be that there's nothing nefarious about it at all. \n\nThis scenario is particularly complicated bc of how women's bodies are sexualized and objectified. If a man tried on a brand new style it would be way less of an issue... No one would assume he had bad intentions... and many modern styles for women are just more revealing than what things were a generation ago... Not to mention, our bodies are different and they change throughout life- I could wear a crew neck and have cleavage, and people would judge me for it but there's nothing inherently wrong with wearing a t-shirt...\n\nFor me, if my partner feels great in their clothes, good for them. If they're happy, I'm happy. It's not for me or my family to judge or police them... \n\nMy mom can wear what she wants on her own body but doesn't get to dictate other's wardrobes, and certainly not through this weird mamas boy triangulation that turns her son against his partner... \n\nIt would be another thing entirely if your mom is expressing genuine concern because your wife is dressing skimpy AND flirting with guys outside the marriage or whatever, but I didn't hear you mention any of those other more concerning behaviors...\n\nDefinitely applauding the step you took to let your wife her know how her outfits makes you feel. She should definitely take that into account! And she may not have known. \n\nAs per your mom feeling awkward shopping together - what can your mom do to enforce her boundaries with your wife for herself? You mom is an adult. Your wife didn't have a gun to her head... Why does your mom expect you to do this emotional labor for her? What does your mom need to process for herself about her upbringing and clothes and body image that may have nothing to do with your wife or you...?\n\nBasically, I really caution the folks jumping to NTA and it creeps me out how entitled they feel to control and judge women's bodies. \n\nDon't think YTA either. Just think everyone in this scenario needs to do more of a gut check about what they're feeling, own it for themselves and communicate better. Highly recommend therapy.", "Yta, your mom needs to get over herself. She also needs to set boundaries with your wife. If she doesn\u2019t want to dress that way then dont. Her saying she didn\u2019t say no to make your wife happy but come running to you about it. That is very contradicting. Why would she say something if she wanted to make your wife happy?

And she has a point, When we were dating she used to wear such outfits only when we were going on dates or at beaches, But now she is wearing on almost daily basis.\n\nFor instance, Recently we went on a family function and my wife decided to wear IDK what its called but(Dress with side slit, Her undies were totally visible to everyone and she was OK with it).\n\nOn a family trip with my mom, she decided to wear a micro bikini(Which made my mom uncomfortable because it was actually skimpy)\n\nAnd I lost shit when recently she decided to make my mom \u2018Fashionable\u2019 and took her to shopping and made my mom try and wear sports bras, Gym shorts and she convinced my mom to wear it with her on shopping, for her happiness my mom agreed(Mind it she made her wear gym shorts and sports bra on a market trip with her) later my mom told me all about it, how embarrassed she felt.\n\nI confronted my wife about it, and she said I am overreacting and that my mom also needs to open up.\n\nAm I the asshole here to tell my wife this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Have you asked your wife why she feels so strongly on this matter?.

I noticed from your profile where you're based in I think. Even with all the modernization going on, from a family perspective, we are still a conservative bunch. The the 'log kya kahenge' mentality is big. I think it's important to have a conversation with your wife and find a middle ground where she still gets to wear most of what she wants but not going overboard to make you or your family uncomfortable or put her in a position that compromises her safety (assuming I'm right about where I think you're from, I've lived there for a year).", "I understand you want to please your mom and your wife but telling your wife what to wear is not the answer. She should be able to wear whatever she wants - poor choices and all. Your mother, on the other hand, does not have to take fashion advice or go shopping with her.

That should be obvious but I guess not.\n\n- It seems like your wife was genuinely trying to bond with her MIL. Your mum should have simply said she wasn't comfortable. Your mum wasn't trying to please your wife, she wanted ammo for your regular itching sessions.\n\n- Yeah your GF maybe should have thought about what your mum would want when dressing her up, but I'll give her some grace cos mum played along and didn't actually tell her how she felt. \n\nReligion is supposed to support kindness, peace and acceptance. As good ol' Matthew said in the bible: \"do not judge, or you too will be judged\". If you feel that it is in your religious interests to dress a certain way then on you go, don't judge others for not adhering to that. If you have a problem with women dressing provocatively, then maybe date someone who doesn't? You're obviously attracted to her and how she dresses so why is it now suddenly a problem after your married?

Your mother is an adult and perfectly able to say 'No.'  If she hasn't learned this by now, it is high time for her to begin.  Secondly, yes, YTA if you work on trying to control your wife.  She isn't your 'property,' but a full-grown woman.  If you find her attire unacceptable to you, don't go out with her and let her know why.

Lastly, I don't know what kind of interactions you have with your wife, but do you compliment her often?  Do you take her out to do things she enjoys?

That's not your wife's fault. But have a conversation with your wife that your mum doesn't like to dress up but might be too shy to say anything, and your wife needs to respect that. At the same time, it seems your mother is shy to the point where seeing another woman's body upsets her. That is again not your wife's fault.
