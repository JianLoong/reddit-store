She never said or did anything to my wife or me and could hurt my wife) later my mom told me all about it on phone, how embarrassed she felt.\n\nI confronted my wife about it, and she said I am overreacting and that my mom also needs to open up.\n\nAm I the asshole here to tell my wife this?\n\nPS. Based on the comments that I am getting, It seems people can even justify that If my wife decided to go totally naked in public, Then also people will judge me for asking her to dress normally?

Your wife has little respect for your mother or her discomfort. She likes to shock your mother and doesn't care she's making your mum uncomforable. She doesn't have the maturity as yet to truly appreciate that others are more conservative and that's OKAY.  She will justify it by saying your mother needs to losen up and women can do whatever they want with their own body. That woman can wear what they want, where they want blah blah blah....you  know, today younger women vibe.  You wife will NOT change, maybe when she's in her 40s & 50s she'll realise what a selfish git she was...but that realisation and maturity is some years away yet.\n\nI have no real suggestions.

How is that conducive to a good relationship between them?\n\nInstead of coming to reddit looking for people to agree with you, maybe give your wife the benefit of the doubt, and the chance to discuss this with you like an adult!", "It sounds like all 3 of you are the assholes here", "YTA. Defend your wife and tell your mom to mind her own business and body.", "There's a lot going on with this dynamic with your mom, you and your wife, and it's not all about clothes...\n\nFirstly, your wife dressed like this when you married her right? Isn't there some value to accepting your partner for who they are..?\n\nWhy was it ok by you for her to wear these clothes at the beginning of your marriage when you named feeling like it was for you and the same behavior isn't ok now? \n\nWhat do YOU feel about it and why?? \n\nNot your mom - this is YOUR relationship.\n\nWhat's changed with how you feel about your wife's style recently and why? \n\nWhat does your wife feel? If your wife has in fact had a recent, drastic change on her end, you should ask her to learn more about where it may be coming from emotionally.  Is she going through a mid life crisis? Does she feel validated with these clothes? Does she just think they're cute? Are they just a new style for women? Is she (still) wearing them for you? Is she coming into her own feeling herself in her body in a new way? Hearing from her why she is expressing herself this way is extremely important before jumping to conclusions. It may be that there's nothing nefarious about it at all. \n\nThis scenario is particularly complicated bc of how women's bodies are sexualized and objectified. If a man tried on a brand new style it would be way less of an issue... No one would assume he had bad intentions... and many modern styles for women are just more revealing than what things were a generation ago... Not to mention, our bodies are different and they change throughout life- I could wear a crew neck and have cleavage, and people would judge me for it but there's nothing inherently wrong with wearing a t-shirt...\n\nFor me, if my partner feels great in their clothes, good for them. If they're happy, I'm happy. It's not for me or my family to judge or police them... \n\nMy mom can wear what she wants on her own body but doesn't get to dictate other's wardrobes, and certainly not through this weird mamas boy triangulation that turns her son against his partner... \n\nIt would be another thing entirely if your mom is expressing genuine concern because your wife is dressing skimpy AND flirting with guys outside the marriage or whatever, but I didn't hear you mention any of those other more concerning behaviors...\n\nDefinitely applauding the step you took to let your wife her know how her outfits makes you feel. She should definitely take that into account! And she may not have known. \n\nAs per your mom feeling awkward shopping together - what can your mom do to enforce her boundaries with your wife for herself? You mom is an adult. Your wife didn't have a gun to her head... Why does your mom expect you to do this emotional labor for her? What does your mom need to process for herself about her upbringing and clothes and body image that may have nothing to do with your wife or you...?\n\nBasically, I really caution the folks jumping to NTA and it creeps me out how entitled they feel to control and judge women's bodies. \n\nDon't think YTA either. Just think everyone in this scenario needs to do more of a gut check about what they're feeling, own it for themselves and communicate better. Highly recommend therapy.", "Yta, your mom needs to get over herself. She also needs to set boundaries with your wife. If she doesn\u2019t want to dress that way then dont. Her saying she didn\u2019t say no to make your wife happy but come running to you about it. That is very contradicting. Why would she say something if she wanted to make your wife happy?

And she has a point, When we were dating she used to wear such outfits only when we were going on dates or at beaches, But now she is wearing on almost daily basis.\n\nFor instance, Recently we went on a family function and my wife decided to wear IDK what its called but(Dress with side slit, Her undies were totally visible to everyone and she was OK with it).\n\nOn a family trip with my mom, she decided to wear a micro bikini(Which made my mom uncomfortable because it was actually skimpy)\n\nAnd I lost shit when recently she decided to make my mom \u2018Fashionable\u2019 and took her to shopping and made my mom try and wear sports bras, Gym shorts and she convinced my mom to wear it with her on shopping, for her happiness my mom agreed(Mind it she made her wear gym shorts and sports bra on a market trip with her) later my mom told me all about it, how embarrassed she felt.\n\nI confronted my wife about it, and she said I am overreacting and that my mom also needs to open up.\n\nAm I the asshole here to tell my wife this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Have you asked your wife why she feels so strongly on this matter?.

I noticed from your profile where you're based in I think. Even with all the modernization going on, from a family perspective, we are still a conservative bunch. The the 'log kya kahenge' mentality is big. I think it's important to have a conversation with your wife and find a middle ground where she still gets to wear most of what she wants but not going overboard to make you or your family uncomfortable or put her in a position that compromises her safety (assuming I'm right about where I think you're from, I've lived there for a year).", "I understand you want to please your mom and your wife but telling your wife what to wear is not the answer. She should be able to wear whatever she wants - poor choices and all. Your mother, on the other hand, does not have to take fashion advice or go shopping with her.

As good ol' Matthew said in the bible: \"do not judge, or you too will be judged\". If you feel that it is in your religious interests to dress a certain way then on you go, don't judge others for not adhering to that. If you have a problem with women dressing provocatively, then maybe date someone who doesn't?

Lastly, I don't know what kind of interactions you have with your wife, but do you compliment her often?  Do you take her out to do things she enjoys?

At the same time, it seems your mother is shy to the point where seeing another woman's body upsets her. That is again not your wife's fault.

I see that you are still surprised people don't agree with telling people what to wear.

However, it's a real problem in families.\n\nFrom your point of view, you want to protect your mum's feelings, and you also want to protect your wife's (generally speaking).

I, for one, am of the mindset that there\u2019s a time and a place for everything, and not every outfit is appropriate for every occasion. But that\u2019s *my* belief. The only person I can apply that to is myself. With my partner, I can make suggestions or requests, but that\u2019s it- they are free to do as they please, even if it goes against my preference. That\u2019s their right. Anyone trying to dictate how another adult dresses, YTA. \n\nThat said, a lot of how your requests/suggestions are received comes down to the delivery. It\u2019s a lot easier to get someone on the same page as you when you don\u2019t make them feel defensive. As soon as you get into \u201cyou have to do this\u201d, or \u201cyou\u2019re doing something wrong\u201d territory, you raise up their defenses and make them feel like the only options are to A: fight back and put their foot down to avoid getting pushed around, or B: give in, thereby accepting the blame for doing something bad and allowing yourself to be controlled. Neither is a good option. It\u2019s much easier to get someone to see your POV when the approach looks more like, \u201cyou\u2019re not doing anything wrong and you\u2019re not to blame for this situation, but it would mean a lot to me if you would be able to make an adjustment. Can we at least have a conversation about it?\u201d But even then, you still have to accept that the answer may be \u201cno\u201d. \n\nThe second issue is your wife pushing your mother to wear clothes that mom is not comfortable wearing. To me, it\u2019s hard to say who\u2019s the asshole here, because once again, the style of communication is the most important factor, and since you weren\u2019t there, we have limited info to work with. \n\nThe initial idea for you wife to take your mother shopping and encourage her to branch out with her style is a nice one and could have been a great opportunity for them to bond! But this only works when both parties are on board. \n\nIf your mother spoke up and communicated her boundaries, your wife is TA. Just as with you and your mother, wife needs to understand that she cannot control how others dress, nor can she stomp on others\u2019 boundaries. \n\nIf your mother did not speak up, how was your wife to know that she was unhappy? Sure, she has the knowledge that your mother usually dresses conservatively, but lots up people are open to trying new things or testing their boundaries, and your wife may have genuinely believed that was what was happening. If your mom just quietly went along with the shopping trip and did not make her feelings known, mom is TA. \n\nWhile I certainly can\u2019t know for sure, I suspect the second version is closer to the truth, as per your comments about your mother not wanting to hurt your wife by saying no. This makes me think that your mother has a larger issue with people pleasing. Saying she doesn\u2019t want to wear certain clothes, even if your wife is super excited and trying to talk her into it, is not hurtful! Perhaps disappointing, but not hurtful. They still could have shopped together, but each dressing/buying to their own preferences. But instead of making her own choices like a fully grown woman, it sounds like your mother quietly laid down in front of a steamroller, then blamed the steamroller for not knowing she was being crushed. She could and should have taken the same approach as your wife, and refused to let someone else tell her what to wear.", "I guess it depends on one's upbringing, culture etc. Personally, I can't imagine wearing stripper clothes in front of my in-laws - there's a place for everything and that's not the place.", "I just have to say your not the ass hole and the comments did not pass the vibe check", "I feel like asking her to cover up May make your wife more inclined to wear more revealing clothes", "It's sounds like op comes from a very conservative family.

What is it he felt he'd found when he met his wife? Where does he personally fall on the modesty/body positivity spectrum?

I'm extremely body positive, my children played in the pool in only bottoms until my daughter decided she wanted to wear more than swim trunk, my son ran around naked until he was 4, and he's only upgraded to boxers since then. Even when we have went out shopping or casual dining, my children have chosen their own clothes and worn them. Sometimes that meant I picked out produce with a puppy dog and a witch, sometimes it meant the waitress mistook my sparkly, tie-dye rainbow, gaudy hair pin wearing son as a girl. It's their body and their choice. \n\nHowever, I set parameters, because common sense and social expectations are important to know and understand, there's a time and a place. If we're in our home they're welcome to be butt naked if they desire, if they're going outside/casual visits/out shopping etc, they need to dress appropriately for the weather (long sleeves and a jacket in late fall for example), for holidays/important family gatherings, it was dressier clothes like slacks and button ups or a nice dress, for my grandparent's recent double funeral, it was a black suit my son chose at the store and a long black dress my daughter chose with pink ribbons. \n\nThe first time my cousin brought his girlfriend to introduce her to the family, she was wearing tight jeans cut into shorts so short that you could see the bottom of her butt cheeks and all the pockets were sticking out of the leg holes (it was a fashionable style at the time) you could tell she was commando. My grandfather gently asked her where the rest of her pants were. He wasn't intending to embarrass her, he was genuinely shocked and asking if he'd misunderstood and the pants were skin colored where they cut off or something. \n\nWhat she wore *was* inappropriate for the situation, and she *was* embarrassed. Of course her body, her choice, but that doesn't free you from consequences, like being embarrassed the first time you meet your boyfriend's family, or in your case alienating your mother in law. \n\nIt is not a huge ask to not wear clothes that reveal your undergarments while interacting with people who are uncomfortable with that level of intimacy with you. Your mother isn't asking her to wear a burka, she's just asking to not every inch of skin that wouldn't be covered by underwear. it's not unreasonable in my opinion.\n\nEdit- and for the people who downvote me, y'all know dang well you wouldn't feel the same if the situation was reversed and the OP was a woman complaining that her husband was wearing a tiny penis pouch as a bathing suit, or see through pants with tiny underwear around her family and making her mother uncomfortable and coercing her dad into wearing those things against his will.", "Right, because it's impossible to believe that a woman would just do something to make herself happy and comfortable?

I have a cousin like that and take extra time and effort to make sure she's comfortable in unnecessary things because I care about making sure I don't push her into something she's not okay with, because she's a breathing doormat. She is so terribly uncomfortable with confrontation that you can easily push her into anything simply by asking her to do it.

She is extremely disorganized and they grocery shop weekly, but she doesn't go prepared and will buy bits and bobs where they end up with a bunch of boxes of stuff they don't use and everyone ends up eating wienies and ramen for dinner. I know she doesn't like doing it (she's never said so of course), but all I have to do is say, \"Hey, let's go check your cabinets and make a menu and shopping list for next week.\" And she'll immediately get up and we'll go get it done so she can start clearing out the 8 boxes of chili mix she's accumulated because she forgot she already had some, bought more, and never used it, or the 22 jars of spaghetti sauce she has for the same reason. \n\nI don't feel good about doing that to her, I acknowledge that it's something she'd rather not do, but I also know that she will get overwhelmed and avoid things like that to the point that it's a huge issue to tackle because she's too shy and submissive to ask for help. I've gone up to her home many times before a cps visit (long story, they're good parents, his infertile sister and her husband were obsessed with taking the kids) to whip her husband and children into a cleaning party, gotten all the laundry done, the trash removed, the toys put away, the pantry and fridge organized and cleaned, the dishes all done and put away, fixed the random broken things around the house she never told her husband to fix. I wouldn't push the little bit that I do if it wasn't so important for her health and keeping her family in tact and as stress free as possible. \n\nLiterally the only way you'll ever find out my cousin doesn't like something is if she mentions it to someone else in a very casual and light manner. It's how I found out she didn't like me cursing around her kids. I told her I'd heard about it and she tried to deny it but I interrupted her to apologize profusely, taking full responsibility for the trouble it might cause them at school or church, and asking her to please tell me directly when I've done something wrong, that her choices for her children were valid and it was important to me to respect those choices, she accepted my apology and we moved on. She still doesn't come to me directly, but it could be because I haven't done anything warranting it being told to other family members because I haven't heard anything from them either. \n\nImagining someone pushing my cousin into those kinds of clothes (which she definitely wouldn't be okay with) is infuriating.
