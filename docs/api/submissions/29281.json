We met in our home country and after a few months started living together. Three years into your relationship I have received a job offer abroad, which I took at the beginning of 2019 and he joined me at the end of 2019 (we spoke about this possibility at the very beginning of our relationship). Till then he had a job, but this has changed after he moved to the other country with me. At first he couldn't apply for jobs as there were permissions needed, but at the same time he had this idea of becoming a streamer. I am making good money and could support both of us, so I wanted to give him a chance to pursue his dreams. But after 4 years and him being very comfortable with not working I\u2019m at my wits end. Over the years I was slowly trying to suggest he started looking for a job, talking to him, that I cannot be our only source of income and that it is draining me mentally to think what would happen if I could not work. In the meantime my health got really bad and I am currently not able to work. My company is giving me a few weeks of short term disability with 100% of pay, but after that it will drop to 60%. This will not be enough to cover our needs and I will have to resort to my savings (which is not a lot). As for my husband, he is still streaming and doing things with his channel, he says he\u2019s looking for jobs but at the same time he refuses to consider jobs that require going to the office (\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend 2h a day in public transportation\u201d, but also refuses to make a driver\u2019s license and use the car we have). While at home he makes me food and does some basic chores from time to time, but that\u2019s basically it. We have always shared household responsibilities even when I was working and he wasn\u2019t. But now I physically cannot do it and don\u2019t have the strength to ask him to do the things that need to be done. The last straw, which made me come here and ask strangers for opinion is what happened today. Due to my condition I am currently sleeping around 15h a day and was not able to wake up and answer a call (not sure who it was, probably the doctor\u2019s office). I asked him, if he could keep my phone and answer potential calls, if I\u2019m not able to, so that I don\u2019t miss any info from my doctor. He said he can\u2019t do that, as he would have to remember to carry out around and he's uncomfortable talking on the phone with people and I should\u2019ve known that by now. \r\nWould I be the AH if this was the final straw for me in this relationship? I also don\u2019t want to go broke and leave my carrier abroad, cause the only money we have is my salary and my savings (he has nothing).", "created_utc": 1697766168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bzn4u/wibta_if_i_left_my_husband_cause_he_refused_to/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell him it is time for him to go home or get a job. Tell him you are tired of supporting him and with your health, you physically cant do it anymore. So he needs to either go home to live with his family and find a job there or get a job here.", "Your husband is a what we in America call a dead beat and has been for a long time. He needs to get a real job.", "NTA. While I think it'd be wise to talk to him first about how upset his refusal to help you by answering your phone made you, and how you're not happy with your marriage right now and that things must change or you are **done**. He is *way* too old (and I'm his same age) to be so naive to put all of his eggs in the become-a-viral-popular-money-making-streamer basket, and neglect to even get some kind of part time job. ESPECIALLY now that you are unwell and could use the financial help, in addition to him to actually help you more. Of course, it's up to you if you want to have a final super clear conversation if you think there's a chance your relationship can be changed, or if you are just truly done.", "I would certainly talk to him about all of this before just leaving. He's behaving like an irresponsible teenager and he needs to start behaving like a responsible adult. But if you just leave, there's no chance to talk through this and make serious changes.\n\nNTA if you talk to him first.", "NTA\n\nIf that\u2019s what it took for you to realize it was time to throw the whole man out, fine", "NTA.  It sounds like you have carried him for a long time, and for not very good reasons.  That he\u2019s not willing to do much of anything to carry his own weight in this relationship is a perfectly good reason to call it quits.", "NTA - it\u2019s not about the phone, it\u2019s about - does h\u2019s actions make your life better most of the time? From what you wrote I\u2019d say no.  Your life will improve without him.", "NTA, everyone has a limit and you have hit yours.

How is he going to be able to wake you if that can't?", "NTA. You don't really need a reason to break up with someone in the first place, it's often when people try to find a 'reasonable explanation' for their feelings about leaving that they end up staying because they can't come up with anything that they think would 'justify' leaving. It's less about the action itself and more about how it makes you feel. He should've noticed his surroundings by now and actively sought out a way to help you, he can't even answer a simple phone call reliably. In the end, if him not answering the phone is the straw that broke the camel's back, then so be it.", "Nta. You are physically ill because of his laziness. You won\u2019t get better while he is being useless.", "NTA. And I have a feeling you\u2019re going to start to feel a whole lot better, physically and mentally, when he\u2019s gone. We carry stress everywhere, and it can cause, or at least exacerbate, physical illness. It sounds like he\u2019s more of a strain than a support, and at some point you have to put yourself first. 4 years of willful unemployment, whether he moved somewhere for you or not, is untenable.", "This sounds like my ex-husband. If it has been four years, I guarantee he will not change. He might make promises that he will to make you feel better in the short-term, but in the long run he is going to sap you of all your joy, finances and independence. NTA but you're right, this should be the very last straw.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am sure he has good parts of him that you love, and a part of him probably really love you.  But if he refuses to put you and your family (as a unit)'s need above his own, then he isn't the lifetime partner for you.  Please have respect for yourself and your own worth and leave him.", "Stress can make you ill. I knew a few that's happened too. Hope you get better soon.\n\nYou married a man who was pulling his own weight in the relationship. He worked full time and you could build a retirement fund or travel \n\nHe moved with you and legally couldn't get a job right away. So you were on board for him to do his dream job \n\nYou gave him 4 YEARS to get his busy to be profitable and it isn't. Its a hobby, not a career \n\nHe should be doing all the cooking and cleaning. His excuse that he didn't like to talk to strangers is STRATEGIC INCOMPETENCE  You might want to look this up.\n\nGive him a deadline to find a job -- 2 months, 4 months...  Even if that means public transit. It'll be hard going back to the workforce since he's been out of it for 4 years. He may need to work at a temp agency if he can't find a job in his own. \n\nYou need a partner,  not a child. \n\nIf he doesn't love you enough to get a full time job,  divorce him and send him to his mother. You are ill and he does nothing to take care of you. Doesn't that tell you something?\n\nYou know your husband and if you need to protect your money \n\nYour up a couple of hours. Put all bank accounts in your name if you haven't already, hide checkbooks if you use them. Change the back account your paycheck is deposited into.\n\nMaybe cancel credit cards that are joint accounts. If he wants money to spend he'll need to get a job or go home to mom. \n\nSorry you're in this situation but you need to decide what you need to do \n\nNTA... for reaching your breaking point. A husband refusing to answer the phone should the doctor calls for his sick wife is an ass. You deserve better treatment.", "If a man can't talk to strangers for you while you are sleeping because it might be slightly uncomfortable, doesn't seem like you'll be able to rely on him for anything actually hard.  He's not willing to make the slightest sacrifice for you, supposedly his closest family.", "I believe he has around 40", "As for the second part of the question a loud ringer should be a solution, although it's proven somewhat problematic to wake me up recently. I thought he could take the call if need be, not just wake me up to it.", "Oh. Oh god.\n\nYeah, he needs to start doing something real with his life, like, yesterday.", "Even if he wasn't particularly talented, if he was making any sort of effort at his channel, he would have more than that. He's a layabout and is using you. NTA", "There is nothing unreasonable about this whatsoever. Why would he be so uncaring about missing an important call from the Dr? Does he not care about your health?\n\nMy husband was very ill recently and I made a point to answer his calls if he was sleeping or in the bathroom, specifically so he wouldn't miss anything from the Dr, because his health is important to me.", "It's one thing if you have a landline for your home.\n\nI think it's a bit unreasonable to ask anyone else to field calls to your personal cellphone.", "Usually I get like one call a day if any. And it's only because I'm sick. We use other means of communication with friends and family.", "Not even remotely.\n\nIt\u2019s a very small ask of a partner, particularly one who does fuck all else."]}
