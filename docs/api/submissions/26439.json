He's settled on a destination and so excited at the idea of a family trip. We're looking at flights that will likely be at least 9 hours long with business class flights, resort stay, and plenty of experiences. He makes significantly more than me but we will split the cost of the holiday 50/50 including my child's costs.\n\nThe problem is he does not want to let my child (13) on to the same class on the plane as us.He thinks that my child should be grateful to be getting an international trip and just enjoy the movies and whatever other amenities there are on the flight. That they can pop up and visit us whenever in business class and that it's not worth the extra cost, even if he were a millionaire.\n\nI feel like it's weird to sit apart from my child for a 9+ hour flight, even if they're comfortable enough on a plane and I'd probably prefer to downgrade my flight if bf is unwilling to split that specific cost.He thinks I'm being weird for wanting to make that concession and it's not a big deal for child to fly alone.\n\nSo, WIBTA or am I being a helicopter and stressing over something silly?\n\nEdit To Add: Just as a further explanation for why he's against it.   \nHe has a view where children might not appreciate the value of business class and that his parents went on business class while he flew economy on his own.\n\nHe absolutely wants to enjoy the business class for himself for the long haul on a nice plane. He's fine with me sitting in economy also or bumping up my child at my own cost, even though he disagrees morally and thinks I'm being kind of silly, he would accept it.\n\nHe has spent plenty of money and time on my child, for birthdays, events and milestones. They get along well and have had very few upsets. Every now and then I've had to stick up for one or the other but I feel like that's to be expected with blended families.", "created_utc": 1694162736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16d55ab/wibta_if_i_left_my_child_in_economy_while_we_flew/", "score": 2511, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will turn 50 soon and have also decided it\u2019s time my husband and I start enjoying business class.", "Right... It's not like he's saying he won't pay.   \n\n\nI personally do partially agree most kids don't care for business and are spoiled with it at a young age. The bf himself was in economy when his parents were in business and has no malice.", "Agree! I flew internationally with my two kids, ages 11 and 13. Put them in the first row of premium economy and I was in the last row of business class. I also got Starbucks gift cards for the flight crew. When one of the FAs stopped by my seat to thank me they asked if they could do anything for me. I just asked that they let me know if it looks like my kids need anything. I also went back a few times to check on them.\n\nCost to upgrade in my case was like $2k per ticket. Sure my kids would prefer being in business, but tough shit. They don\u2019t appreciate the meals and obviously don\u2019t drink alcohol. They also don\u2019t need the extra room.", "Exactly!\n\nIt was standard for my parents to fly first / business class while me and my siblings flew economy. It was made clear to us that perks like flying first class were a luxury, and that luxuries are earned. It\u2019s also wildly expensive and probably not thoroughly appreciated by a 13 year old kid.\n\nIt\u2019s the same reason why my parents slept in the master bedroom at home, and the kids either shared a bedroom or had a small single room. They are the ones paying, so they get the luxuries.\n\nAlso, what\u2019s with all the bashing of this guy? If he didn\u2019t like the kid, he wouldn\u2019t bring the kid on the trip and pay for half the cost. He would have just demanded that the kid stay home.", "Finally, someone said it!", "I agree with you. Not surprised with the comments on here but he literally said she can pay the difference herself or sit with her child so I don\u2019t get the problem. He\u2019s already paying half of the cost of the trip when he should only be paying for his portion and she should pay for her and her child. \n\nAll he wants to do is enjoy himself on the flight. And it\u2019s crazy how some of these comments immediately jump to \u201che hates your child blah blah blah\u201d", "Fr fr.  People be wildin' on this thread acting like 13 year olds will be traumatized by spending a few hours away from their parents like 13 year olds don't spend all their time locked in their bedrooms with their headphones on.", ">All the redditors assuming your boyfriend doesn't like your kid are terminally online.\n\nJFC It took me way too long to scroll to find something like this. OP says \"They get along well and have had very few upsets. Every now and then I've had to stick up for one or the other but I feel like that's to be expected with blended families.\" \n\nVery valid IMO, no step parent/step child (or parent/child for that matter) will go without its upsets. \n\nA 13 year old may very well enjoy the independence of being on a plane by themself for the first time. And clearly the BF was raised this way and thinks it has its benefits and isn't just doing it to fuck over the kid or whatever.   \n\n\nOn these long haul flights business class is several thousands of dollars more expensive, and IMO the idea of kids not having all the luxuries from the beginning does increase appreciation for it when they can afford it/finally get to try it out but thats neither here nor there.   \n\n\nNTA unless the kid really doesn't want to sit by themself", "Seriously. There's no indication that this is a pattern of behaviour or what the child thinks.   \n\n\nI think the real problem is most of these 15 years old's would be mad if they had to ride in economy so they're freaking tf out.", "I\u2019m with you. I can totally see parents having their kids fly economy and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do the same to my own kids once they\u2019re old enough. Kids are resilient enough to withstand an economy seat for 9 hours, but mommy and daddy need to be rested enough to enjoy the trip without back and knee pain.

Those are very different things.", "THAAAAANK YOU. \n\nMaybe there are all kinds of step issues here, idk. But that\u2019s only one possibility from these facts.

Her BF is a stingy AH for even suggesting this plan and OP ought to seriously reconsider their relationship.", "Oh, you just reminded me of this one time:\n\nI was taking a Greyhound bus by myself as a young teen.\n\nA mother traveling with 2 little girls saw me and put her older child next to me, and then sat behind us with the younger child.\n\nI know that it was as much for my protection as her daughter's, but I very much appreciated it then and even more so now.\n\nThanks, random lady!", "I have experienced that but thankfully the men were just verbally creepy and just leered at me instead of trying to touch me. It was still an awful experience. I think they behaved because it was a small jump jet, and the woman flight attendant was keeping an eye on me.\n\nAlthough the attendants still kept giving the men alcohol. On a flight that was less than two hours. Once they were really drunk they left me alone and slept. \n\nWhen we were on final to land, one guy woke up the other while leaning over him to look out the window. The guy who was asleep wasn\u2019t happy. Then the other guy said he was looking because he was entranced by the wheels that magically appeared from the wings. Dude was so fucked up he didn\u2019t understand how landing gear worked.", "Happened to me on my first solo flight as a teenager. I fell asleep and woke up to a grown man feeling me up. I was 14.", "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4cThis\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c Young children are not equipped to handle, persuasive social intruders, of any kind. Especially, in such closed quarters.", "I know, I've flown both. My business class flight seats on Virgin Atlantic were on another floor.\n\nMy business class flight on BA was infront of a premium economy section. Coach flyers were not allowed to come past that section.\n\nOn Air France business and first class were still premium cabins away from coach. I was first there, but there were still no coach people wandering around the business cabin.", "I said\"Most likely\", and I was talking about biological father's. The biological father of the children these women date, would MOST LIKELY become the full time parent if something happened to their biological mother.\n\nRe-read the post I was replying to. It was about women dating men with kids and considering the kids a mild background annoyance/inconvenience, they'll never have to deal with.", "This comment was referring to the women dating men who had kids but only saw them when kids were with their mum & didn't want anything to do with the kids. So it would be bio dad being full time dad if something happened to the mum.", "Actually, in the original fairy tales, it wasn't step mothers it was actual mother's. The brothers Grimm, however, believed motherhood was sacred and changed it to step parents, and everyone else just kind of followed suit.", "My husband's father had 4 marriages. At his funeral, one of tea exes, who wanted nothing to do  with him as a kid, saw us and our 3 small kids. Suddenly, she was all about having some kind of relationship with us. Too bad lady, you had your chance.", "Nope, even before the second child and ex-wife came back Meredith was talking about sending first child to boarding school as soon as she got married to the dad.", "Exactly. And here OP is, still thinking she won the partner lottery.", "While I'm always one to want to understand the why behind people's actions, I'm also a firm believer in even semi intelligent adults being able to see that just because it's what happened to them doesn't mean it's what should happen to everyone.", "This isn't flying by yourself. This is flying in economy while your mother, and stepparent of 5 years fly in business. It is *not* the same as flying on your own.", "100%. That's why I never think it's a good idea to come here with your problems. It's heavily skewed to ppl that are super reactionary and quick to give extreme advice they would never take themselves or even how they would feel if they were in the situation. It's easy to tell some internet stranger to destroy their lives but highly irresponsible", "Omg that\u2019s heartbreaking. I knew women like that in *high school*, but most if not all eventually grew out of that.. or at least had better standards for a partner. Obviously some never do. And ya know what if you want to do that to yourself then fine, but not when there are kids involved.", "Exactly. The kid could have relationship issues in the future if his mom goes with her bf\u2019s plan so that the kid see\u2019s his mom choosing some man over him. \u201cI\u2019ll just tuck him back here with all these strangers, then run back up front to my main focus in life so that we can hangout and enjoy the journey!\u201d That\u2019s how her son will see it. Poor kid. \n\nI feel bad for the mom being in this situation too: having to treat your child poorly and go on with a comfortable life OR rock the boat and likely cause strife between her and the bf, which could end up with her being a single mom again, possibly struggling without anywhere to go.", "yup. she allows this in the future and she'll have less power when it inevitably happens again. he'll go, \"we did it before, we can do it again\". and this is how expectations are set.", "I want the young people I love to have a better time than I did at their age. I can\u2019t understand why others do not feel the same.", "Well yes. That\u2019s kinda the point of the comparison.", "I\u2019d of felt I wasn\u2019t loved and was being put second in my mothers mind to the boyfriend. People seem to think this is all about the kid being \u201cspoilt\u201d. That man cleary doesn\u2019t like the kid, and now he\u2019s got a \u201cfamily\u201d holiday but right off the bat isolated the kid from their mother. That sends a strong message people are missing here\u2026", "I wouldn\u2019t have liked it as a kid. It would have been being alone that would have made anxious not that I wasn\u2019t in first class\u2026. I think this definitely depends on the kid. Op knows her child better than anyone. And obviously she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.", "Myself and my kids (20 & 16) went to LA last year. My now 21 year old has pretty bad anxiety and she was freaking with every take off and landing. Like death gripping my hand type of freak out. She might have been ok with her sister if I was in a different class, but knowing my kid, I wouldn\u2019t do that to her.", "One my friends, aged 3 in the late 70s, was forgotten by his dad when they went out and it was just two of them. He managed to walk into a police station and get himself sent home!", "Tons of good examples were out there yes. Home Alone is obviously not one of them. They got way too far from home without turning around for their kid. Twice.", "True. And it was also probably easier to not have the child actors in the scenes between the parents", "I bet the dogs still fight about it to this day, but you just don't know cuz you don't speak dog.", "Approval from total strangers online means nothing when you are so clearly in the right but for what its worth you absolutely made the right decision.\n\nSome people are utterly incomprehensible and dont get that attached to their pets, but to people like me a cat or a dog is a family member in every sense that matters and anyone who would a) try to make you get rid of them and b) hold it against you that you were prepared to take them and leave to protect them from someone who didnt have their best interests at heart is someone you can do without.", "That is actually really beautiful! Thanks for keeping each other safe there \u2764\ufe0f", "awwww how beautiful of the mom to do\ud83e\udd79 people like this give me hope", "My apologies. I read that totally wrong. Thank you for being so kind.", "Wait this is so interesting. Do you have a source?", "I believe you, but also there is a reason why that stuck. It could have evolved back into regular mothers, but for some reason this version stuck more. That is the point of myths, fairy tales, and other cultural stories. They reflect the current values of a culture by being morphed by retelling.", "Totally this. I always question if the people who respond here have even had a passing relationship with another person because every reaction is black or white. They can never understand there might be grey area to anything.", "Yeah, I've never understood that attitude either. It especially confused me when I *was* a kid.", "Do parents always know what their kids want? Or even care? I would have loved it, but there's no way in hell my mom would have allowed it.", "Yes that was sarcasm. Didn't think I needed the \"/s\" \n\n:)", "Gah, not to be a buzzkill but the economy class dog died a few years ago. He was a Very Good Boy, though. I guess I'll never know if recreating in that business class seat and eating the beef roast for lunch would have helped add years back onto his too-short life. But the Prissy Dog still feels very fancy about herself.", "https://retellingthetales.com/the-problem-of-the-evil-stepmother/", "I guess I just take insults about stepparents personally. I watched my sister step in and be a better mother to her step kids than their actual mother (who at one point literally abandoned them and moved to Dallas). But I also saw how sad she was because her in-laws were trying to convince her husband to reconcile with the mother of his children.", "Sorry for your loss. Of course he was a very good boy! If anything, I'm sure his harrowing flight in economy strengthened his character and spirit. :)", "That was a really interesting read. Thanks!"]}
