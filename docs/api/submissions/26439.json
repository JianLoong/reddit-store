He's settled on a destination and so excited at the idea of a family trip. We're looking at flights that will likely be at least 9 hours long with business class flights, resort stay, and plenty of experiences. He makes significantly more than me but we will split the cost of the holiday 50/50 including my child's costs.\n\nThe problem is he does not want to let my child (13) on to the same class on the plane as us.He thinks that my child should be grateful to be getting an international trip and just enjoy the movies and whatever other amenities there are on the flight. That they can pop up and visit us whenever in business class and that it's not worth the extra cost, even if he were a millionaire.\n\nI feel like it's weird to sit apart from my child for a 9+ hour flight, even if they're comfortable enough on a plane and I'd probably prefer to downgrade my flight if bf is unwilling to split that specific cost.He thinks I'm being weird for wanting to make that concession and it's not a big deal for child to fly alone.\n\nSo, WIBTA or am I being a helicopter and stressing over something silly?\n\nEdit To Add: Just as a further explanation for why he's against it.   \nHe has a view where children might not appreciate the value of business class and that his parents went on business class while he flew economy on his own.\n\nHe absolutely wants to enjoy the business class for himself for the long haul on a nice plane. He's fine with me sitting in economy also or bumping up my child at my own cost, even though he disagrees morally and thinks I'm being kind of silly, he would accept it.\n\nHe has spent plenty of money and time on my child, for birthdays, events and milestones. They get along well and have had very few upsets. Every now and then I've had to stick up for one or the other but I feel like that's to be expected with blended families.", "created_utc": 1694162736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16d55ab/wibta_if_i_left_my_child_in_economy_while_we_flew/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
