Grief is hard, and I can relate to this story on both sides. As someone who has lost people close to me and as someone who has had to deal with a withdrawn and grieving parent.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable thing to ask. It is likely that your child understands that he is upset and is trying to help they only way they can by showing affection. I think it might be best for there to be some attempt at a compromise. \n\nAsk your husband to try to accept your child's affection when they are trying to give it, even if it's just letting them sit on his lap while he processes so they can feel like they are helping or being there for him at least. \n\nAlso, talk to your kid and explain what is happening. Not just that dad is busy, explain that he is going through something very hard, and he is working through it the best he can. Tell them that all you both can do right now is love him and be patient. Kids understand a lot more than what a lot of people give them credit for. They are also very empathetic. \n\nIf your kid has ever lost a toy they really loved, or something similar, tell them their dad is going through something like that. That he lost someone he loved a lot and he needs lots of love and patience until he is feeling better. \n\nI hope that helps!

Maybe even an ask about joining him for a session or two to be able to ask the therapist for guidance to help support both him and baby the most healthy way possible...

There will likely be times when your husband *can* and should try harder to be emotionally available for your two year old.

But not for long at a time. These things are too deep for a two year old to retain for long.\n\nYou'll have to repeat it, fairly often/consistently. Like several times a day. \n\nBut it's better to explain what's happening rather than brush it away. \"he's busy\" reads to a toddler as \"too busy for me\", while something brief like \"he's sad\" might just mean dad needs some ice cream to cheer up.\n\nI'd try something like, \"Daddy is very sad, because he can't hug his (parent) anymore.\"\n\nAnd at a separate time, or if they ask questions. \"Daddy's (parent) died. That means they can't be here with us.\"\n\nAnd again, separately, explain grief: \"This kind of sad is like being sick. Daddy will get better when he isn't sick anymore.\"\n\nDon't say all the things all at once, they won't process it. But be honest, and explain the feelings.
