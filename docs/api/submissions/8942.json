Grief is hard, and I can relate to this story on both sides. As someone who has lost people close to me and as someone who has had to deal with a withdrawn and grieving parent.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable thing to ask. It is likely that your child understands that he is upset and is trying to help they only way they can by showing affection. I think it might be best for there to be some attempt at a compromise. \n\nAsk your husband to try to accept your child's affection when they are trying to give it, even if it's just letting them sit on his lap while he processes so they can feel like they are helping or being there for him at least. \n\nAlso, talk to your kid and explain what is happening. Not just that dad is busy, explain that he is going through something very hard, and he is working through it the best he can. Tell them that all you both can do right now is love him and be patient. Kids understand a lot more than what a lot of people give them credit for. They are also very empathetic. \n\nIf your kid has ever lost a toy they really loved, or something similar, tell them their dad is going through something like that. That he lost someone he loved a lot and he needs lots of love and patience until he is feeling better. \n\nI hope that helps!

Maybe even an ask about joining him for a session or two to be able to ask the therapist for guidance to help support both him and baby the most healthy way possible...

There will likely be times when your husband *can* and should try harder to be emotionally available for your two year old.

But not for long at a time. These things are too deep for a two year old to retain for long.\n\nYou'll have to repeat it, fairly often/consistently. Like several times a day. \n\nBut it's better to explain what's happening rather than brush it away. \"he's busy\" reads to a toddler as \"too busy for me\", while something brief like \"he's sad\" might just mean dad needs some ice cream to cheer up.\n\nI'd try something like, \"Daddy is very sad, because he can't hug his (parent) anymore.\"\n\nAnd at a separate time, or if they ask questions. \"Daddy's (parent) died. That means they can't be here with us.\"\n\nAnd again, separately, explain grief: \"This kind of sad is like being sick. Daddy will get better when he isn't sick anymore.\"\n\nDon't say all the things all at once, they won't process it. But be honest, and explain the feelings.

It was really eye opening. Even a two year old can sit around thinking terrible things about why a parent is behaving a certain way. I still cry thinking about this! What I\u2019m saying is YES, dad could be damaging the child\u2019s psyche. It might help to explain to the little one that daddy is super sad about his parent being gone, and he\u2019s having a hard time. It\u2019s a good time to be super patient with daddy. Kids don\u2019t want long explanations, but they deserve some explanation.", "I don't", "My dog actually gets excited when she gets tripped over, because she knows apology cuddles are coming.

He sounds like he's been traumatized and needs to process what's happening.   \nHe might need medication short term.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Some shocks are too extreme for the system.     \nThat he's ignoring his own child is a big clue that something is wrong.    \n\n\nTell him that you're really concerned and feel he needs help.  And you can simply ask your General Doctor where he advises you to go for that help in the area.  (Chances are if you tell your GP what happened he can get you in pretty fast for your husband to see someone).  This is urgent.  \n\n\nIt sounds like your Husband is disassociating.  He may not even be registering that your kid is there. I was there 20-something years ago after an assault.  I was losing time and not conscious of the world around me.  I got in with a good trauma therapist and got better.    \n\n\nI do highly recommend EMDR for long-term good results.   \n\n\nIn the meantime go see the family Dr - go with him if that's possible and if he permits it.  It will help to have the outside view of his behaviors presented.  The Dr can at least prescribe something short-term until you can get in with a therapist (if that takes a week or two).", "I want to add the slightly unpopular NAH.\n\nMy dad lost his mother when I was three. My mom rushed him through grieving because she was overwhelmed with caring for my sister and I (we were very young and I suppose that was a heavy burden to hold).\n\nHe never quite finished grieving for his mother. It\u2019s a process half finished. I see it every time we talk about her. It\u2019s something that makes me miss my grandmother now, too. \n\nI think it\u2019s very understandable that you want your husband to be present for your child- these years are so important. But honestly, at age three, I wouldn\u2019t have remembered if my dad needed a few extra minutes to get up off the couch so that he could be fully present when he finally came to play in the yard. Please, please be kind and give him the time he needs to heal.", "My mother lost her father when I was about four. Everything changed that day. She became hard and distant and angry. I had no idea what I\u2019d done wrong. Please work with your husband to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen for your little one.", "NTA spouse needs to do their duty to their young child.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is pretty caught up in his situation at the moment, and it would be good to make him aware of his actions and how they are making your child feel.", "Wnbta. While one month is not long in the grief process, most ppl are back to work & trying to move forward. Losing a parent is devastating. Try your best to keep him moving forward so he doesnt get stuck in his grief. I had to get myself to the point that i didn't think abt my mom, in a way that would make me sad because it feels like if i start to cry, i will never stop. And its been almost 15yrs. Don't let him pull away from the kids (unless he is having a really bad day), they are the joy & blessings that tether us to the present", "NTA i feel for your husband's loss, but he's still a father and needs to act like that.", "Why are you referring to your child as 'they'? Have you not been told in the delivery room if they are a boy or a girl? Have you not looked in 2 years?", "NTA. But I would give the two-year-old a different explanation to daddy \"being busy\". That will just show them that daddy can be \"too busy\" to love me. Try saying something like \"Daddy is very very sad because \\*grandparent\\* is gone, but he loves you very much.\"", "You can explain to a 2 year old that Dad is sad, when you swoop in to provide a distraction, just say \"daddy is sad, lets see if he wants a hug and then we can go make a picture for him\" etc.\n\nBe prepared for weird kid logic, consider the things you do when they are sad or upset, like when they hurt themselves do they get a plaster or ice pack? They may try to offer Dad an ice pack, etc \n\nI hope he can move through his grief and be able to help around the house again soon, his grief will be around for years though.", "I think the appropriate thing to do is to reach out to his therapist and explain what is happening at home with the kids and ask if it would be appropriate to have a discussion with him about this in a therapy session or if they could address it with him. His ignoring his children is a huge red flag and a symptom I think of some major depressive issues. The therapist should know about this. If they decline, then I think you have no choice but to remind him that while what he is grieving is a horrible loss, he still remains a parent and he needs to find a way to pull himself together to at least acknowledge his children and start being their Dad again.  He is not entitled as a parent to completely check out. NTA.", "NTA. He is the parent, the adult. Being a parent means he will eventually have to rally, but it\u2019s only been a month and your child is really little. They honestly won\u2019t remember this. In the meantime, don\u2019t make your worries  your son\u2019s worries. He might be picking up on your anxieties. He misses his daddy because they must have been quite loving and close before this happened. That *will* happen again.\n\n I\u2019m glad your husband is getting help. You might call the therapist to let them know you believe your husband is disassociating.

I fell really badly towards my dog once (A Labrador Corgi mix).  She looked so appalled? lol It was hilarious in retrospect.  Her face probably reflected the look on my own?  \"Timber! Amazon falling....!\".\nI managed to not hit her.  Thank goodness! I'd have hurt us both.  I had the worst bruise on my left knee and lower leg for a month? (And jammed both wrists).

That the cracker you dropped stays the same, even though it looks smaller way done there.  Knowing this actually really helped me not want to snap at my kiddo.", "As a mother who has lost a parent, I still had to be a mother.

For the full amount of time since we found out, her and my aunt had been his primary caregivers. So extremely emotionally and physically involved. Me and my siblings range in age from 27 to almost 18. And she never made us feel like we were on the back burner. Because she knew we were still her kids. Obviously we don\u2019t need as much as a 2 year old does but just because a loved one passes away, doesn\u2019t mean you get to ignore your kids.", "NTA grief is hard but as a parent of a toddler no matter how you are feeling you cannot just check out of your child's life when your home with them.  A 2 year old cannot understand, especially not over a long period, do be gental and understanding but firm, if his child is asking for his attention he needs to at least pay attention pick up and cuddle.  He cannot ignore then, he cannot dismiss them and when the part of the process happens he cannot take his anger out on them.  It will cause emotional damage.", "Yes, the sentiment of the comment is fine, but equating the dad's absent parenting to the loss of his own parent is misplaced and the kind of argument that might fuel his stress and guilt rather than lead to some useful insight about how to deal with his grief.", "Dogs definitely do understand that - or rather your reaction after it. When I had my pooch (small yorkie with bushy/semi-long tail) she loved to move around people's legs (and rather stealthily so often you haven't noticed).

What you are describing is some attachment instability, but he has a few more years to repair. I don't believe it will be seen as him abandoning them or *the same* sense of loss as what he is going through. A child needs *one* person to be a stable attachment figure, so just make sure you're giving them extra connecting time with you until he is ready to repair.", "NTA. Your child is developing into a little person and needs love, care, guidance, and stability.

A two-year-old doesn\u2019t.\n\nSometimes, we become so consumed with grief over a loss that we won\u2019t allow ourselves to take joy in life as we once did. I imagine there\u2019s a certain guilt involved feeling anything positive. But not only does your child need their father, your husband needs to engage in those little things than can bring joy, like caring for and playing with his child. It definitely warrants a serious (and, as others have said, gentle) discussion.", ">Gently remind him that his grief is because of the loss of his parent and you know he doesn\u2019t mean to but he is creating that same sense of loss in a toddler who doesn\u2019t understand why daddy doesn\u2019t want to be with them anymore. \n\nOP, please don't use this sentiment. The parallel between the husband's catastrophic loss of his parent and his absence to his child is symbolic at best, not reflective of reality, and might do more harm than good.

My eldest was 3 and he and I had to find time amongst it all because he felt left behind.
