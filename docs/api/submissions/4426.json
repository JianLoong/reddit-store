This IS a hill worth dying on.\n\nI guarantee you that if OP had taken the approach of, \"I just went along with BIL and forced my child to eat because of our rent situation,\" all the same people screaming at her about the rent/SAHM status would be screaming \"what kind of mother doesn't protect her child?!!?!\" instead.", "My kids are 5 and 7 and when we had our oldest 7 years ago, we could aggord it", "I am so glad someone else gets it. We tried and couldn't afford it", "But BIL and sister are in the same boat roof-wise.  They shouldn't be throwing stones", "Lol accurate", "\"Just stop being poor\"", "You\u2019re an idiot if you think most people have the means to save up $50K lmao, that doesn\u2019t make people bad parents. \n\nThey\u2019re also not living with them for free, the four of them all pay rent.", "It's sad that he had to scream at her.  But it's partly because his sister (her mom) is working against him.  In the long run, is it better for the child to think that her behavior is good and normal?  Or is it better to point out that standing out in this manner will stunt her social development?  \n\nI put hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill.  My daughter doesn't want to eat them.  Normal reaction?  OK, she doesn't eat.  OP's reaction?  Oh baby...sorry to upset you.  Can I cook you something special?  \n\nSeems like an act of kindness, but it's pure evil in terms of what it's setting the kid up for, later in life...\n\nBIL obviously sees the danger.  Too bad his sister doesn't.", "Yeah, so completely diferent from the original story.

He\u2019s not the parent, the kid\u2019s education is none of his business.\"\n\nThat's an interesting viewpoint.  If a child is being abused but it's not your child, you should keep your fricking mouth shut?  The daughter is acting ridiculous and the mom is enabling her ridiculous behavior.  But it's your position that the uncle should just mind his own business.  \n\nAnd when the daughter has a very lonely depressing life because she never developed proper social skills, we should be thankful that the uncle minded his own fricking business and thus didn't try to help her?\n\nThis is not about hot dogs and hamburgers and food preferences.  Your happiness depends on good social skills.  The BIL knows that.  Many people here miss it, which is why the BIL's actions seem (on the surface) extreme.\n\nBut a frog who boils to death slowly still dies.", "You\u2019ve built a whole tale of child\u2019s neglect and entitlement because OP\u2019s child doesn\u2019t like hot dog and hamburgers and her mother is not forcing her to eat them. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That\u2019s quite a feat.", "NTA.   However, it is irrelevant that your BIL lost his kids to CPS.   He could have 12 kids in a happy home.   It doesn't matter.

Not sure if others posted this yet (there are so many comments) I would look into a teacher's aide or something else in the school district your kids are in ( hours and days off would align with your kids).

It was entirely possible to tell him no without being deliberately hurtful.", "I'm going to guess that this over-reaction was more related to a constant criticism from BIL that nobody was intervening to stop?  On the surface it seems a tad bit harsh.  But if he keeps trying to get his little digs in, eventually he will get a response.  I'm sure sorry he feels bad.\n\nNTA", "So let's recap here. You live in a household with a brother-in-law whose children got taken away by CPS.

You say that the criticism isn't easily exposed because they hide it.\n\nYou've got to find a better way. That toxic environment is future therapy for God knows what else your brother-in-law is doing and what you are allowing your children to be exposed to and what you say everybody else can't see because they hide it.

Sometimes kids do the picky thing for control reasons, but it sounds like your daughter is being pretty consistent with the dislike for hotdogs. You\u2019re not wrong for fixing her something else.", "ESH - it was unnecessary. And knowing it was due to his drug addiction, not his lack of parenting knowledge - really AH statement. You did it just to insult him, no validity to it at all.\n\nYes he F\u2019ed up as a parent, and yes he is wrong to tell you he knows your daughter better than you or apply some archaic generalisation to her and criticise you on that alone. He is wrong, and AH in his delivery. He was a bad parent in his actions. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean you get to demean him now, and as a parent I\u2019m disappointed you would. I can only imagine the pain of knowing you caused losing your kids and hurt them enough in the process, I\u2019d never prey on someone on that when they\u2019ve clearly turned things around and are paying the price for their actions. Any parent can at least acknowledge that\u2019s a very visceral pain - even if you don\u2019t empathise. It says something to flippantly hurt someone like that at a cookout with everyone there. \n\nEven though he belittled you, you knew he had no standing to tell you how to parent and anyone there would too. You didn\u2019t need to feel that defensive - and were cruel back to a very common annoyance many parents face (people critiquing our parenting). I get it built up, but then say \u2018BIL does this all the time, can someone please tell him to stop critiquing my parenting or find him a distraction.\u2019 That would\u2019ve been fair game imho", "Nta but your questions about if people realize the cost of daycare I\u2019d like to answer.  The answer is yes. Most mature adults factor these things before starting a family.", "OP, you need to consider why BIL lost his kids. I know he was using drugs, but CPS probably would not even know about him using unless something bad happened while he was high. Did he actively hurt a kid? Was there profound neglect? Did a person he hung out with hurt his child? \n\nThe reason I say this is because if for ANY reason (I live in Texas where they keep making up new reasons), they will run a check on every adult in the home for prior CPS or criminal issues. Depending on why BIL had his kids removed, you could be considered a \"non-protective\" parent for letting BIL be around your kids. That is a real thing. CPS will not care if you needed roommates to share the rent. They will tell you that either BIL moves out permanently or your kids have to live somewhere else permanently, with or without you. \n\nThere are many situations that can't be predicted. But if one of your kids gets hurt in an accident at home and the Dr has to report the injury because of the law and/or hospital policy, you knowingly having a person that CPS considers dangerous living in the same house as your kids won't be considered an accident. \n\nThis is what I know from watching, professionally and personally. Mileage may vary. CPS investigators and supervisors often have to make judgment calls, using their own human, possibly biased judgment. So what a supervisor in one office decides needs to happen in a case could be very different from what a supervisor in another office thinks should happen. It's not a totally arbitrary process, but there are flawed humans involved. \n\nI might have started repeating myself here, which means I'm feeling some urgency that you \"get it\", even though I can't control that. So please just consider this to be some of the fine print you (anyone) should have had to read when deciding who should live in the same household as your children.", "NTA we all make our choices in life and have to live with the outcomes of those choices.  He chose drugs, lost his kids to cps because of said drugs.  He has no say in how you should raise your kids.
