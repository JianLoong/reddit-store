Anyway, my parents were super abusive. You can look at my posts on JustNoMIL for knowledge but just know some of the abuse violated the Geneva Convention. They loved drinking, smoking, drugging. This abuse went on for years until I was 6 and my siblings and I were taken away. They had another kid, abused that one, it was taken away by CPS. This patterned continued until the 7th and 8th kids. By this time, CPS learned that they would abuse their kids so the kids were immediately given up for adoption. As was the 9th kid. \n\n\nIt took them 6 kids, 10? Years to decide that my parents were unfit. They gave them 6 kids to learn to be good parents. If it took my parents 10+ years to lose ALL their rights, I can only imagine the abuse BIL dished out. He should be grateful he's not rotting in a cell in felony child abuse charges.", "So you are arguing that because he as a disease, his children should suffer abuse and neglect as side effects? This is not a debate on whether or not addiction is a disease, you are trying to make this into something it is not.\n\nHe tried to parent his kids when his uncontrolled disease affected his *children*. If he had attempted to control it with rehab and counseling, obviously CPS wouldn't have taken his kids. But he decided not to get help until presumably *after* his kids were taken. If we are going to use the disease argument, let's do it all the way or not at all. If he lost his kids because he couldn't take care of them due to cancer, it would still suck, but most people who have cancer or other physical diseases make better child care arrangements than those who are too selfish not to get help for their very real problem.\n\nMy issue isn't with you saying they need to discuss it. My issue is you saying OP is on a high horse when a) they all live in the same house BUT pay rent separately to the landlord, and he and his wife are behind on their payments when OP and her husband are not b) OP does more for the house than her BIL per comments c) OP buys her own food for her family and does most of the cooking d) BIL was bitching about her child's \"pickiness\" and tried to force them to eat when it very well may be a sensory or medical issue and let's not forget e) he has made a habit of criticizing OP's parenting at every turn. She didn't just go for the jugular to begin with, this was a historical problem that bubbled over. You have no idea whether or not she has tried to talk to him about it before. Usually people like that are too bull-headed to have reasonable discussions. People like OP's BIL like to act like their shit doesn't stink and then get butthurt when they are called on their crap.

Her husbands illness and her unemployment caused a setback for them, in response, her sister & BIL opened their rental to them. point being people have setbacks beyond their control when illness strikes & we all need to respond with grace, not as an open invite to kick at them when there is a disagreement.

You try explaining to a bull-headed person like her BIL is being over and over again your preferences. You can explain nicely something 100 times, but when you understandably snap at time 101, I don't think that makes OP an ass. I think that makes her human and she shouldn't be ridiculed about it. I guarantee BIL doesn't feel half as bad about being an ass to her all of those previous times. The fact OP feels the least built guilty about what she said after numerous attempts to get him to stop says she's a better person and more mature than him. BIL's previous disease does not give him an excuse to be an ass to OP continuously over disagreements over parenting. And that line about what BIL thinks about \"discipline\" can certainly be illuminating if we want to read further into that, too.\n\nIt's clear we're not going to agree and I'm not going to waste my time educating you on why we don't need to suffer assholes quietly just because they do something nice for us begrudgingly... and if people are constantly criticizing you while they are trying to \"help\" you, then they are offering their help begrudgingly.

It has horrible consequences  I find it very frustrating that folks in general find it ok to just repeated judge addicts & it\u2019s ok to insult them as though it is not an illness.

Brother does not deserve his SIL digging at what she knows to be an open wound for him.
