It\u2019s a health issue.", "Nta. But jeez, her friends sound toxic. I'm still trying to process how this counts as being controlling when it's a medical issue?", "NTA. It's an allergy, not just a dislike of some ingredients. So, she's fine with you having hives? How is it \"controlling\" to ask someone to not consciously expose you to a substance that causes your body distress? She doesn't sound like a caring person.", "Dude, this is fucked up in a lot of ways. You are not being controlling, you are literally asking her to not actively trigger your allergies.\n\nOf course people dont think it's a big deal, it's not their skin breaking into hives.\n\nAnd dude, this is a little bit of a Red flag. If she thinks that you asking her to change the bodywash due to your allergies is controling, just you wait what other stuff she will try to make you ok with as to not be seen as controling.", "I'd be worried about continuous exposure - which could potentially make your allergies worse or life threating.  Her continuing to use it is a lack of respect to you.", "NTA and honestly it\u2019s kind of a red flag to me that she\u2019s running to her friends and asking for advice about whether she should keep using her body wash that makes you break out. It\u2019s not a big deal to change it, just do it. To me it\u2019s such a small request that if living together is a trial run, I would say it\u2019s already not going well.", "Nta. Everyone else in the story is though. Her, your friends, and her friends. Clearly no one cares about your allergies/health.", "NTA. You\u2019re gonna have a difficult time living with this girl if she\u2019s so bad at compromising. You have a clear and logical reason for your request and she\u2019s just being stubborn for no reason.", "NTA- \n\nAnd I guarantee living together isn\u2019t going to work out. Sure this may seem like a small request to her, but not even considering it should be a red flag to you. I\u2019d be damned if I didn\u2019t consider my partners requests. Not only that, you don\u2019t want someone who has to run everything by their friends first. Trust me. It will become a relationship between everyone instead of staying between you and your partner", "NTA. Requesting your partner change their body wash because it's literally causing hives is the most benign request one could make in a relationship. Not controlling at all. (The only controlling attitude here would be hers if she decides to keep using it and force you to continuously break out in hives.)", "NTA.\n\nYour request isn't frivolous, nor is it controlling.\n\nNor is it even particularly high-stakes. There are plenty of other body washes out there that won't trigger your allergy, but she's refusing to compromise.\n\nDoes your girlfriend seriously want to make this the hill that your relationship dies on? A body wash, FFS?\n\nI once had a partner who agreed to stop using a particular brand of soap because I found the smell unpleasant and overpowering. And I didn't even have an allergy! It was just my personal preference. My partner was happy to switch, because there are a bazillion other soaps out there, all of which they were happy to use, all of which I was OK with.\n\nIt was no big deal to them. Giving in on the stuff which is a much bigger deal to your partner than it is to you contributes to a healthy relationship.\n\nIf I were Jess, I'd be very upset that my body wash preference was causing you physical discomfort. I'd throw it out in an instant and buy a different one.\n\nComplaining to her friends and calling you \"controlling\" is a worrying red flag on her part.", "NTA. It isn't a big ask.\n\nEdit: also if you are continually exposed to an allergen your reaction can become worse.", "NTA. I cannot understand a partner refusing to accommodate for a legit allergy that you are having a reaction to. Huge red flag.", "NTA - Jess is being an AH and so are her friends for telling her that youre \u201ccontrolling\u201d for telling her to switch.\nIts literally a nut allergy. They sound stupid. \nIf Jess cared about you, and truely understood your allergy she wouldve already switched the body wash without prompting or wouldnt have purchased it in the first place out of concern for you.", "NTA. However you may want to rethink the relationship if she's not willing to help prevent you from breaking out in hives and allowing others to make decisions for her (referencing the she did respect your allergy but decided to switch back because others said that was controlling). \n\nWhat if she decides that she likes eating nuts in her \"own\" home one day and it's not something she's willing to give up....", "NTA. She has no consideration for your quality of life.", "NTA - honestly if this is how she reacts with a reasonable request, then don\u2019t bother moving together because she\u2019s not worth it. If she loved you, she would want the best for your health. Clearly she\u2019s a selfish person who could not give away her bodywash for you! Doesn\u2019t that tell you all you need to know???", "Dump this idiot.", "NTA, your girlfriend is a giant AH. I have over 30 really bad allergies, so my husband had to make a lot of changes for my health. He occasionally mentions that he misses having a dog or something like that. But he would never put a want before my wellbeing. Your trial run is showing some red flags. Don't move in with someone who thinks giving you hives is no big deal.", "NTA. If my partner had an allergy to a product I used, I wouldn\u2019t even need to be asked to stop. I would just stop so she didn\u2019t have a reaction.  If she insists on using the body wash, you should insist that she not use your shower", "NTA This is not controlling for crying out loud. Can she not think for herself? And if it's the residue of it in the shower that's affecting you, she could clean the shower and the sprayer after she uses it to prevent you having a reaction.", "NTA. Definitely a red flag on her part. This is an allergy, not a preferance, and it's affecting your health. I personally don't know why she's holding on to this so hard. My bf changed his deodorant because I didn't like the one he'd been using (well, they didn't have his favorite scent when he ran out, so he got a different one and I was like \"Phew, I was not a huge fan of the apricot deodorant)((we were pretty new then)), and I changed mine when he finalllllly mentioned he didn't like mine (after I moved in). Why wouldn't I want to smell good to my bf, especially now that we live together?", "NTA. Her bath products give you hives.", "NTA\n\nIt's your shower. If she wants to use it, she needs to clean your shower after use.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine saying no to my husband on something like this. It\u2019s about caring about your partner and their health.", "NTA. If she won't even make this small of a concession then she's not a keeper.", "NTA\n\nI mean I bare to join the typical AITH just break up with her train but uh\u2026choo choo.", "NTA,  and not controlling either. It is literally a medical issue.", "NTA. My husband is allergic to nuts. And I don\u2019t even do a butter pecan smelling candle. Because I don\u2019t know what would happen to my husband.", "How inconsiderate of her. NTA", "NTA it\u2019s an allergy, this is a health issue", "In this relationship, it's not you and her it's you, her, her friends, anyone on her side in every argument.", "This seems like a warning sign to not let her move in", "NTA. I change my body wash all the time when I see something new that I like the smell of or whatever. I really don\u2019t see why this is such a big deal for her. That\u2019s really wild that she sees it as controlling. If you had said \u201cI want her to change her body wash because I consider the brand too expensive for how much she makes and find her spending inappropriate.\u201d I would see an issue, but a simple allergy and a nice request to look for something else is reasonable. I would be more concerned with this reaction and ask what about the request she considers controlling, then update us because I\u2019m honestly curious lol. When you live with someone else you usually have to make small adjustments, this seems very basic.", "Wow, I hope you're not thinking about marrying this girl.  She's clearly not on board with the whole \"in sickness and in health\" thing if she won't even make a minor change to keep you from breaking out in hives regularly.  NTA", "Tell her that y'all's trial run of living together isn't working.  She's leaving allergen body wash all over your shower which you are reacting to and *which is totally avoidable*.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like moving in together is an awful idea", "NTA in the slightest, but I would just ask her to take a break from it to see if it resolves the issue. My son has nut allergies as well and apparently the oils aren\u2019t supposed to be a problem he\u2019s got scalp medications that contain peanut oil even. If being intimate with her isn\u2019t giving you hives I would expect the shower head to be even less of an issue, it could be another product she\u2019s using giving you hives.", "NTA,  not even close. Find a woman who respects your allergies.", "NTA. Your rationale is \"exposure to this makes me physically ill\"; hers is \"my friends said 'lol dude just needs to learn how to be inflamed all the time what a wuss.'\" No contest.", "NTA", "Nta. At all. She is. She should definitely change her body wash.", "NTA. Honestly this would be a deal breaker for me. It's crazy that she thinks you're being controlling when she is literally causing you to get hives", "NTA - in fact, this is a really good indicator this is not your person. I can walk into any drugstore and find 25 body washes that won\u2019t cause you to have an allergic reaction. Her unwillingness to do this for you, on top of labeling it a controlling behavior of yours, is wrong. \nAnd btw - repeated exposure can make allergies worse.", "NTA. Brother, as someone who's been here before please take my advice: save yourself the trouble and leave her. \n\nYou made an extremely reasonable request and anytime you do so in the future, if she doesn't agree with you, her and her friends are going to gaslight you into thinking you're being unreasonable. \n\nThe fact that you had to ask this question to begin with is proof it's already started.", "NTA. I\u2019m very particular about my soaps and lotions because my skin is very sensitive and finding one that doesn\u2019t set my skin off is very hard. But I\u2019d absolutely go through the trial of finding another if my partner was allergic to an ingredient. It\u2019s not controlling, it\u2019s basic common decency.", "NTA -she\u2019s more committed to her body wash than you.", "NTA\n\nAllergies tend to get worse\u2026not better. Her body wash is causing you physical allergy symptoms. And she\u2019s decided to listen to her friends instead of the person experiencing the symptoms.", "NTA. You\u2019re asking for a small change so you don\u2019t break out in hives. Surely there\u2019s at least one other body wash out there she likes", "NTA. Most customers at my work let us know of any allergies-especially to egg if any- and I try to offer them the alternative dressing-an oil and vinegar dressing-which doesn't contain eggs.", "NTA, this is a health issue. you're not being controlling by wanting to limit exposure to allergens.", "Jess is an asshole. Do not date - do NOT live with - assholes.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You need to end this relationship or she needs to dump her selfish friends. This is a medical issue, not a preference. If she cannot do this for you, she's not the one.", "NTA. Imagine thinking it's okay to cause the person you love physical discomfort on a daily basis for no good reason. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI have the same problem with any sort  of nut product and those hives are no joke! There are plenty of body washes that don't contain nut products.", "NTA \nSure, it's not anaphylaxis but that shouldn't matter. It's causing you discomfort/pain and that's a good reason for your GF to change her shower gel. It's such a small thing to do for someone you love and I don't understand why she won't.", "Obviously NTA. Frankly the fact that you even had to ask her at all is concerning. I mean I could understand if she just hadn't even made the connection at first--I'm sure most people just think of food when it comes to nut allergies. But as soon as she realized her body wash was causing you issues she should be wanting to fix that issue herself without any prompting.", "NTA for asking, but since she said no, you should respect that and let her go.", "NAH\n\nWhy not just wash the shower head between usages?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she doesn't care enough about your comfort that speaks volumes about her character.", ">because it's not life threatening,\n\nNot true. That is one of the dangers with allergies, since they don't always follow a dose-response curve. A \"minor\" reaction can quickly escalate to life-threatening, especially a nut allergy.\n\nYour GF and/or her friends are completely clueless, or they don't care.

Just in regards to washing the shower head, it won't just be the shower head, it'd be the shower floor, walls, etc.  And who should do the cleaning?  OP can't as they'd have a reaction from it.

I would still have a conversation that health concerns are valid no matter how big or small, and that you would prefer if instead of her going to her friends she could help you come to a middle ground together on issues like these. She shouldn't feel like she's getting cut off from something and you should have to suffer from her body products in a shared bathroom space.
