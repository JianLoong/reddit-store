It\u2019s a health issue.", "Nta. But jeez, her friends sound toxic. I'm still trying to process how this counts as being controlling when it's a medical issue?", "NTA. It's an allergy, not just a dislike of some ingredients. So, she's fine with you having hives? How is it \"controlling\" to ask someone to not consciously expose you to a substance that causes your body distress? She doesn't sound like a caring person.", "Dude, this is fucked up in a lot of ways. You are not being controlling, you are literally asking her to not actively trigger your allergies.\n\nOf course people dont think it's a big deal, it's not their skin breaking into hives.\n\nAnd dude, this is a little bit of a Red flag. If she thinks that you asking her to change the bodywash due to your allergies is controling, just you wait what other stuff she will try to make you ok with as to not be seen as controling.", "I'd be worried about continuous exposure - which could potentially make your allergies worse or life threating.  Her continuing to use it is a lack of respect to you.", "NTA and honestly it\u2019s kind of a red flag to me that she\u2019s running to her friends and asking for advice about whether she should keep using her body wash that makes you break out. It\u2019s not a big deal to change it, just do it. To me it\u2019s such a small request that if living together is a trial run, I would say it\u2019s already not going well.", "Nta. Everyone else in the story is though. Her, your friends, and her friends. Clearly no one cares about your allergies/health.", "NTA. You\u2019re gonna have a difficult time living with this girl if she\u2019s so bad at compromising. You have a clear and logical reason for your request and she\u2019s just being stubborn for no reason.", "NTA- \n\nAnd I guarantee living together isn\u2019t going to work out. Sure this may seem like a small request to her, but not even considering it should be a red flag to you. I\u2019d be damned if I didn\u2019t consider my partners requests. Not only that, you don\u2019t want someone who has to run everything by their friends first. Trust me. It will become a relationship between everyone instead of staying between you and your partner", "NTA. Requesting your partner change their body wash because it's literally causing hives is the most benign request one could make in a relationship. Not controlling at all. (The only controlling attitude here would be hers if she decides to keep using it and force you to continuously break out in hives.)", "NTA.\n\nYour request isn't frivolous, nor is it controlling.\n\nNor is it even particularly high-stakes. There are plenty of other body washes out there that won't trigger your allergy, but she's refusing to compromise.\n\nDoes your girlfriend seriously want to make this the hill that your relationship dies on? A body wash, FFS?\n\nI once had a partner who agreed to stop using a particular brand of soap because I found the smell unpleasant and overpowering. And I didn't even have an allergy! It was just my personal preference. My partner was happy to switch, because there are a bazillion other soaps out there, all of which they were happy to use, all of which I was OK with.\n\nIt was no big deal to them. Giving in on the stuff which is a much bigger deal to your partner than it is to you contributes to a healthy relationship.\n\nIf I were Jess, I'd be very upset that my body wash preference was causing you physical discomfort. I'd throw it out in an instant and buy a different one.\n\nComplaining to her friends and calling you \"controlling\" is a worrying red flag on her part.", "NTA. It isn't a big ask.\n\nEdit: also if you are continually exposed to an allergen your reaction can become worse.", "NTA. I cannot understand a partner refusing to accommodate for a legit allergy that you are having a reaction to. Huge red flag.", "NTA - Jess is being an AH and so are her friends for telling her that youre \u201ccontrolling\u201d for telling her to switch.\nIts literally a nut allergy. They sound stupid. \nIf Jess cared about you, and truely understood your allergy she wouldve already switched the body wash without prompting or wouldnt have purchased it in the first place out of concern for you.", "NTA. However you may want to rethink the relationship if she's not willing to help prevent you from breaking out in hives and allowing others to make decisions for her (referencing the she did respect your allergy but decided to switch back because others said that was controlling). \n\nWhat if she decides that she likes eating nuts in her \"own\" home one day and it's not something she's willing to give up....", "NTA. She has no consideration for your quality of life.", "NTA - honestly if this is how she reacts with a reasonable request, then don\u2019t bother moving together because she\u2019s not worth it. If she loved you, she would want the best for your health. Clearly she\u2019s a selfish person who could not give away her bodywash for you! Doesn\u2019t that tell you all you need to know???", "Dump this idiot.", "NTA, your girlfriend is a giant AH. I have over 30 really bad allergies, so my husband had to make a lot of changes for my health. He occasionally mentions that he misses having a dog or something like that. But he would never put a want before my wellbeing. Your trial run is showing some red flags. Don't move in with someone who thinks giving you hives is no big deal.", "NTA. If my partner had an allergy to a product I used, I wouldn\u2019t even need to be asked to stop. I would just stop so she didn\u2019t have a reaction.  If she insists on using the body wash, you should insist that she not use your shower", "NTA This is not controlling for crying out loud. Can she not think for herself? And if it's the residue of it in the shower that's affecting you, she could clean the shower and the sprayer after she uses it to prevent you having a reaction.", "NTA. Definitely a red flag on her part. This is an allergy, not a preferance, and it's affecting your health. I personally don't know why she's holding on to this so hard. My bf changed his deodorant because I didn't like the one he'd been using (well, they didn't have his favorite scent when he ran out, so he got a different one and I was like \"Phew, I was not a huge fan of the apricot deodorant)((we were pretty new then)), and I changed mine when he finalllllly mentioned he didn't like mine (after I moved in). Why wouldn't I want to smell good to my bf, especially now that we live together?", "NTA. Her bath products give you hives.", "NTA\n\nIt's your shower. If she wants to use it, she needs to clean your shower after use.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine saying no to my husband on something like this. It\u2019s about caring about your partner and their health.", "NTA. If she won't even make this small of a concession then she's not a keeper.", "NTA\n\nI mean I bare to join the typical AITH just break up with her train but uh\u2026choo choo.", "NTA,  and not controlling either. It is literally a medical issue.", "NTA. My husband is allergic to nuts. And I don\u2019t even do a butter pecan smelling candle. Because I don\u2019t know what would happen to my husband.", "How inconsiderate of her. NTA", "NTA it\u2019s an allergy, this is a health issue", "In this relationship, it's not you and her it's you, her, her friends, anyone on her side in every argument.", "This seems like a warning sign to not let her move in", "NTA. I change my body wash all the time when I see something new that I like the smell of or whatever. I really don\u2019t see why this is such a big deal for her. That\u2019s really wild that she sees it as controlling. If you had said \u201cI want her to change her body wash because I consider the brand too expensive for how much she makes and find her spending inappropriate.\u201d I would see an issue, but a simple allergy and a nice request to look for something else is reasonable. I would be more concerned with this reaction and ask what about the request she considers controlling, then update us because I\u2019m honestly curious lol. When you live with someone else you usually have to make small adjustments, this seems very basic.", "Wow, I hope you're not thinking about marrying this girl.  She's clearly not on board with the whole \"in sickness and in health\" thing if she won't even make a minor change to keep you from breaking out in hives regularly.  NTA", "Tell her that y'all's trial run of living together isn't working.  She's leaving allergen body wash all over your shower which you are reacting to and *which is totally avoidable*.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like moving in together is an awful idea", "NTA in the slightest, but I would just ask her to take a break from it to see if it resolves the issue. My son has nut allergies as well and apparently the oils aren\u2019t supposed to be a problem he\u2019s got scalp medications that contain peanut oil even. If being intimate with her isn\u2019t giving you hives I would expect the shower head to be even less of an issue, it could be another product she\u2019s using giving you hives.", "NTA,  not even close. Find a woman who respects your allergies.", "NTA. Your rationale is \"exposure to this makes me physically ill\"; hers is \"my friends said 'lol dude just needs to learn how to be inflamed all the time what a wuss.'\" No contest.", "NTA", "Nta. At all. She is. She should definitely change her body wash.", "NTA. Honestly this would be a deal breaker for me. It's crazy that she thinks you're being controlling when she is literally causing you to get hives", "NTA - in fact, this is a really good indicator this is not your person. I can walk into any drugstore and find 25 body washes that won\u2019t cause you to have an allergic reaction. Her unwillingness to do this for you, on top of labeling it a controlling behavior of yours, is wrong. \nAnd btw - repeated exposure can make allergies worse.", "NTA. Brother, as someone who's been here before please take my advice: save yourself the trouble and leave her. \n\nYou made an extremely reasonable request and anytime you do so in the future, if she doesn't agree with you, her and her friends are going to gaslight you into thinking you're being unreasonable. \n\nThe fact that you had to ask this question to begin with is proof it's already started.", "NTA. I\u2019m very particular about my soaps and lotions because my skin is very sensitive and finding one that doesn\u2019t set my skin off is very hard. But I\u2019d absolutely go through the trial of finding another if my partner was allergic to an ingredient. It\u2019s not controlling, it\u2019s basic common decency.", "NTA -she\u2019s more committed to her body wash than you.", "NTA\n\nAllergies tend to get worse\u2026not better. Her body wash is causing you physical allergy symptoms. And she\u2019s decided to listen to her friends instead of the person experiencing the symptoms.", "NTA. You\u2019re asking for a small change so you don\u2019t break out in hives. Surely there\u2019s at least one other body wash out there she likes", "NTA. Most customers at my work let us know of any allergies-especially to egg if any- and I try to offer them the alternative dressing-an oil and vinegar dressing-which doesn't contain eggs.", "NTA, this is a health issue. you're not being controlling by wanting to limit exposure to allergens.", "Jess is an asshole. Do not date - do NOT live with - assholes.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You need to end this relationship or she needs to dump her selfish friends. This is a medical issue, not a preference. If she cannot do this for you, she's not the one.", "NTA. Imagine thinking it's okay to cause the person you love physical discomfort on a daily basis for no good reason. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI have the same problem with any sort  of nut product and those hives are no joke! There are plenty of body washes that don't contain nut products.", "NTA \nSure, it's not anaphylaxis but that shouldn't matter. It's causing you discomfort/pain and that's a good reason for your GF to change her shower gel. It's such a small thing to do for someone you love and I don't understand why she won't.", "Obviously NTA. Frankly the fact that you even had to ask her at all is concerning. I mean I could understand if she just hadn't even made the connection at first--I'm sure most people just think of food when it comes to nut allergies. But as soon as she realized her body wash was causing you issues she should be wanting to fix that issue herself without any prompting.", "NTA for asking, but since she said no, you should respect that and let her go.", "NAH\n\nWhy not just wash the shower head between usages?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she doesn't care enough about your comfort that speaks volumes about her character.", ">because it's not life threatening,\n\nNot true. That is one of the dangers with allergies, since they don't always follow a dose-response curve. A \"minor\" reaction can quickly escalate to life-threatening, especially a nut allergy.\n\nYour GF and/or her friends are completely clueless, or they don't care.

Just in regards to washing the shower head, it won't just be the shower head, it'd be the shower floor, walls, etc.  And who should do the cleaning?  OP can't as they'd have a reaction from it.

I would still have a conversation that health concerns are valid no matter how big or small, and that you would prefer if instead of her going to her friends she could help you come to a middle ground together on issues like these. She shouldn't feel like she's getting cut off from something and you should have to suffer from her body products in a shared bathroom space.

There are hundreds of gods, self care products out there that don't have nuts. \n\nThis is what partners do for each other. Compromise and talk. Sounds like you both have some shitty friends.", "NTA. I have a serious food allergy and the allergens are banned from my home. I don\u2019t care if anyone in my household eats things that contain my allergen when they\u2019re not in the home but for my personal health, we cannot have them in the house as they would be stored in the fridge and we run the risk of cross contamination that way. My husband doesn\u2019t mind this because he enjoys me being alive and healthy. Allergies suck, but we cannot change that about our personal health.", "NTA because for one,Your allergic to Nut if she knows that and Continues to use that Almond oil then she\u2019s TA NOT YOU and if her friends thinks she\u2019s right then they\u2019re wrong!!", "NTA\n\nShe obviously doesn't care enough about you to stop giving you hives. This will be 100% guaranteed to apply to other things. Not going to work out just end it now and stop wasting your time.", "Say: okay time for an experiment. You'll put itching powder down her back, and say if she can last 24 hours without washing it off, you'll drop the issue. She wants you to be itchy and uncomfortable. So see if she's willing to put up with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo nut products in your apartment should be a deal breaker for her moving in.\n\nNTA", "You sound like a nice guy, don\u2019t move in together.  First she\u2019s dismissive of your valid concerns, then she talks about it with multiple people, then she tells you the opinions that support her view as if they should take precedence over your experience.  I\u2019m seeing dismissive, disrespectful of your privacy and a hint of gaslighting.\nI don\u2019t know a gentle way to say this, but I suspect Jess is looking for a way out of her parents house.  Sorry.", "> we wanted to move in together and decided to do a \"trial run\"\n\nSounds like the \"trial run\" showed you that she doesn't give much of a shit about you.  Throw her out.  NTA.", "I had hives from a medication once, long ago.\n\nKnow what? Decades later, it's on my list of known allergens in every medical database.\n\nHives are an allergic reaction. You are NTA for making sure your bathroom is clear of such an ingredient.", "NTA you can risk mild reactions becoming major.  Ask your allergist if they have email how dangerous this can be because it can become life threatening. She\u2019s the asshole and it\u2019s a huge red flag.  Run.", "There are hundreds of other products she could use to keep you from getting hives. NTA.", "Fellas is it controlling to literally avoid allergens? NTA", "NTA. I have a lot of allergies and they are getting worse as I get older. I had to ask a roommate to change his body wash because it makes my throat close up if I smell it from the hall. He was ok with it and we aren\u2019t in a romantic relationship. \n\nIf she\u2019s ok with you being uncomfortable because she doesn\u2019t want to switch body washes she doesn\u2019t care very much about you. I don\u2019t expect it will get any better as time goes on.", "Sounds like Jess is controlling if you ask me. \"I'm going to use stuff you're painfully allergic to, smear it all over a water source which you use on your body, use your linens, sit on your couch, touch all your stuff while covered in an allergen in your house and YOU CAN'T MAKE ME STOP.\"", "> just you wait what other stuff she will try\n\nthis part is so important. what other health risks is she willing to force OP to endure for her own convenience?", "All the literal hundreds of shower soaps, lotions and she knows you are allergic to this?  Aaah let her change them or leave. She can stay with her idiot friends. Get a different girlfriend\nalso.", "Nut allergies especially can escalate over time, and not necessarily gradually. Currently its \"just\" hives (which is still a serious reaction), but if she gives you hives every time after she showers it will likely progess. And not even just your reaction to touching her but your reaction in general.  Maybe before crossing someone in passing after eating nuts 15 minutes ago was fine, but maybe now that could cause anaphylaxis. Every allergy exposure is a chance at it becoming worse, and the more you are exposed the more likely it is to happen.", " I\u2019m sure they would be singing a different tune if they were the ones that kept getting hives. \n\nI\u2019d be a bit concerned that you gf is friends with people who clearly lack empathy.", "get her and her nutwash out of your house and don\u2019t let her back until she sees sense. ffs. nta.", "So even a \u2019minor\u2019 allergy can get worse with repeated exposure. To the point that you go into anaphylactic shock because somebody thought, then you better than you about your own body. Do not let them strong arm you into being uncomfortable and impossible danger because of their combined stupidity.", "I guess she thinks it's OK for you to be uncomfortable any time you get a reaction?\n\nI am allergic to most soaps, detergents, and the like. Break out in hives, too, and let me tell ya, not fun at all. Wouldn't want someone to intentionally keep using a product that makes me break out and not care", "Poison ivy isn\u2019t life threatening either but I doubt she\u2019d be ok rubbing against it in the shower, just saying", "a health issue doesn't have to be life threatening, or even life limiting, to matter a great deal. and honestly, it's not up to Jess and her friends to decide what you do or do not need with regards to allergies. in fact, i would argue that they are the ones being controlling towards you.", "Yeah it's not like almond oil is the ONLY oil you can get for whatever she uses it for. It's not like Jess is using a medicine or some treatment OP is allergic to, it's just... bodywash.", "To add on, the more exposure you have to your allergies with reactions, can worsen the reactions with time.\n\nWe didn't know I was allergic to shellfish until I was around 11/12. But, I would throw up and get a rash after eating food with it or cooked in the same pot (Italian family, and they would use the same pots/pans for similar dishes without cleaning in between).\n\nWell, in 8th grade my reaction got dangerous. It had slowly been getting worse with time and exposure. And we figured I shouldn't eat the food made for those meals (like the meal of the 7 fishes served on Christmas Eve and such).\n\nI went into full blown anaphylaxis. Got an epi from the nurse at school, epi in the ambulance, and had to get an epi drip at the hospital.\n\nI went from being sick with a rash to not breathing due to the constant exposure, that's what my allergist told me.\n\nThis is dangerous!", "This is true.  I wasn\u2019t allergic to cats until my 20\u2019s.  That was 40 years ago and I\u2019m now violently allergic to them.", "This is like what happened to me with berries. It started out that I could feel them \u201ctickling\u201d my throat as a child; my family laughed because they thought I was weird as we didn\u2019t know back then it was the beginning of an allergy symptom. I thought nothing of it until I was suddenly no longer able to breathe. Allergies are scary."]}
