There were never close from what i understand, but its progressively gotten worse over the years.  \n\nThe first Christmas we visited the inlaws we did not have a lot of money, they knew this and as we left gave us a little care package with a few Christmas goodies inside, my BIL went on about how pathetic we were to the point my wife was in tears when we left.  \n\nA few years later, we had our young children and were again visiting for Christmas. Christmas Eve we were all sitting in the lounge room watching Christmas carols, BIL walks in, changes the channel without asking anyone. My wife, MIL and FIL all tell him to change it back, he has a hissy fit and storms out.  We go to bed, MIL waits up for him and he doesn't come home until 4.30am and slinks off to bed.  Morning comes, we get up, and their household rule is that no presents can be opened until everyone is awake. Keep in mind, our kids are around 4 to 7 years old, and very excited to open their presents.  We try to distract them with breakfast, etc.  9am, 10am, 11am come around, nothing, kids are asking us if they had done something wrong to not be allowed their presents. 2pm in the afternoon he finally gets up and our kids are allowed to open their presents. As soon as they are done, i tell my wife we are leaving early and to pack.  Our inlaws are upset, and i explain that i have never seen anyone be allowed to act like such a child for so long, and get away with it, and that if they have any interest in hosting us for Christmas again, they will address it.  We leave and apparently there is a massive argument because he cost them time with their grandkids.  \n\nMore years go by, we visit for Christmas but BIL only shows up now and then, and for the most part I can stomach his snide remarks and jabs, but, FIL and MIL ignore it and make excuses for him constantly. \n\nIn the last few years we have moved interstate, kids are older and it is harder to travel  tho we try to see them at least once a year back home. We always invite our inlaws to stay for Christmas but they have always refused because we never invite BIL. My wife wants to extend him an invitation this year as well so her parents will come, but I've refused, i do not want that man in my house, ever, under any circumstances, he has never apologised for his behaviour, and my inlaws continue to make excuses for him.  My wife believes he would not come anyway, but if there is even a slight risk i want to avoid it.  She thinks i am being unreasonable and wants her parents here for Christmas.  I've told her that her parents are always welcome and are invited anytime, and their decision not to come without BIL is not my problem.

To them, hanging out with their golden boy is far more important than spending time with their daughter or their grandchildren.\n\nYour wife is still pretending the problem is you not inviting her boorish brother, not that her parents *clearly* have a favorite and it's not her. \n\nYou don't need to hit her over the head with this truth but you also don't need to accept her framing of the problem.

Ended up in jail for embezzlement which is when we found out about his history of arrests for soliciting male sex workers (while married to a woman), binge drinking alcoholic, got HIV, spent the money his parents gave him for HIV meds on meth and other illegal drugs, died of AIDS. Just a mess. \n\nMy parents invited my grandparents (this uncle\u2019s parents) to visit many times. They visited twice. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we visited them, but traveling with an increasing number of children (ended up with 5) is expensive and difficult. Two senior citizens traveling was much more manageable. My mom even tried urging her parents to move near us. We were the only grandkids (aunt divorced my uncle and thankfully only caught herpes), my mom\u2019s a doctor, and my grandparents had health issues, but they never would leave my uncle. He \u201cneeded\u201d them. He didn\u2019t cling to them. He was a hateful person. \n\nUntil my uncle died in my mid-20s, we spent three Xmas together in my lifetime. Only 1 in my youngest siblings lives. My traditionalist grandfather only got to see one of his grandsons\u2019 sports games in that time frame. It was the highlight of his decade. He could have seen hundreds across different sports and grandsons (and me, lol). I\u2019m the only engineer. We could have built things together instead of just talking about it on the phone. \n\nAfter my uncle died, and when we went out for the funeral, we discovered my grandmother had pretty severe dementia that my grandfather had been hiding, and could because of the distance and my grandmother\u2019s personality quirks. He was overwhelmed and actually collapsed from exhaustion while we were there. \n\nMy mom just moved her parents and my grandfather didn\u2019t protest anymore. My grandmother didn\u2019t even know what was going on. \n\nMy grandfather got to start going to my youngest bro\u2019s sports games. Do every holiday at our house. Etc. About a year in, my very \u201creal men don\u2019t cry\u201d grandpa broke down in tears with me and said he wished they had done this early enough for my grandmother to experience it too. \n\nNTA- but you might want to have a \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d talk with your ILs about what their real life goals are.

You're protecting your family. They're the ones choosing one child over the other. Maybe phrase it like that to them, \"It's sad you're always choosing BIL over wife, that's why I take care to always put her first.\"\n\nMight be the wake up call they need, or at least make them more amenable to spending every other year away from BIL. They're only gonna see one kid at a time anyway, might as well be the nice one that has their grandbabies.", "NTA\n\nBiL is a toxic element.

They've still never been inside it, some terrible health stuff intervened and now they're old, lol. But, the point stands. I shouldn't unilaterally make decisions for a home that I share. Compromise is the bedrock of marriage, you know this. Can you truly not find a compromise for your wife? For a single week at Christmas?*\n\nMaybe invite the parents for 1-2 weeks and the brother for a weekend. Or, your MIL/FIL stay with you and he stays at a hotel.
