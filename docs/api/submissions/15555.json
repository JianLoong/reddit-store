I've got a reactive dog which has bitten (or tried to bite) a couple of people in scenarios similar to that, like FIL opening the front door and entering without knocking, even though usually he's the dogs favourite person in the world. We usually have a bit of a greeting process so the dog is ok with people coming in. Through training she has got much better but even now I would be completely understanding if anyone didn't want to come over and obviously I need to do my utmost to keep guests safe when they do come.

Trauma is trauma, and if this has affected you so badly, you can't be expected to go back. You have no obligation to them, and you're not preventing family events or even avoiding them unless they are held at that house.

You went into their house without them realising. That was the consequence of *your* actions. They don't deserve to be punished for a mistake you caused. Even if you honestly thought it was okay to go inside without asking, they honestly thought that you *wouldn't* go inside without asking. It was a misunderstanding.\n\nNot trusting them to handle their dog because you let yourself into their house without telling anyone is unreasonable.\n\nObviously, if someone invites you around, you expect to be allowed inside the house. But it is also common courtesy to ask permission to go somewhere inside someone else's home (unless you're really close/familiar with the home). Clearly, you were not familiar with the home because you didn't know they had an aggressive dog.\n\n>I wanted to report the dog bite but didn\u2019t as this would likely cause a huge rift with the family.\n\nYou would definitely have been an AH if you had reported it. That's somebody's pet you would have had killed. Clearly, the dog has experienced some form of trauma, or he wouldn't be so aggressive. Just as you can't be blamed for not going back to the relative's house, the dog can't be blamed for his behaviour towards people he doesn't trust.\n\nBased on your current *behaviour* alone, I'm going to say NTA because you're not hurting anybody, and you've set very clear, reasonable boundaries. I think that your attitude could use some work, though. You seem to have taken no responsibility for what happened when some common courtesy could have prevented it. You also seem to be using your absence as a punishment (\"consequence\" as you put it), when I don't think your absence is really hurting them as much as you think it is.", "NTA for never never going to their house again. \n\nTA for not reporting it. That dog is going to injure a child and they're all going to shrug.", "You realize there are people that own the dog that are responsible for it and not OP, right?", "If you have a dog, especially one that may bite, it's your job to tell people. You are responsible for the dog.", "The dog should have been put up,  the family was hosting an event and the bathroom was inside.  Its not wild to think a guest will need to pee. And her question isn't about the first incident, its is it is okay to avoid the house now,  which of course it is,  because these people are irresponsible with their obviously dangerous animal.", "I think it\u2019s a bit much to invite people to a party at your place and expect them to ask permission to use the bathroom.", "Nope.  Dog should have been put down.", "Where the F was she supposed to go? In the alley?", "Yes but she states she deliberately never reported to the authorities cause she didn't want to upset family.
