You planned and budgeted based on that money. Curious, how old are kids and can their parents afford to contribute to college fund?", "NTA -  College funds benefit from time.  How old are the cousins?  Are they 6? 10? 16?  If they are younger, then there\u2019s still time to build it up - even if your parents are older.  If not I would reach out to the extended family - it takes a village.  Your parents are taking on day to day responsibility for these kids.  Perhaps the extended family would be willing to help with a college fund.   I\u2019m not sure this is on you.", "NTA. \n\nYou spent your whole childhood saving up your gifts from relatives. Instead of buying a toy or clothes, you got college money. \n\nYour parents are kind to adopt your cousins, but you are still barely older than a kid and very early in life. You should prioritize making it out of college with as little debt as possible, and one day if you have a good job and solid income you can consider helping your cousins if you feel that you want to.", "NTA. College is expensive, even if you're going to a local community college and I had a college fund my mom set up for me that basically paid for my bachelor's degree and would have contributed to a master's if I'd gotten into the program. If I'd had siblings aside from two stepbrothers who'd moved out of the house before my mom and I moved in, they'd've had their own college funds-my mom wouldn't have forced me to share my fund with any younger siblings. While I don't blame your parents for asking, your college fund is your own money to use for your own education.", "NTA.  The money was already turned over to you.  Their decision to adopt your cousins should not have bearing on already predetermined funds for your college education.", "NAH, they\u2019re not assholes for asking and you\u2019re not an asshole for refusing", "NTA, that\u2019s your money that has been saved for you for your whole life. What your parents have chosen to do is admirable, but they never should have asked. You didn\u2019t choose to adopt anyone.", "NTA", "NAH.  While them asking is understandable, that money was put away for you, and you didn\u2019t get to spend all those cash gifts from relatives that went into it.  It would be kind and generous to share if there is anything left over after you finish college, but not required.", "NTA.", "NTA it's your parents responsibility to provide for them not yours. If the fund is yours, you aren't required to share it.", "NTA. While it is unfortunate they don't have a fund currently, that isn't your fault, and you aren't the one accountable for it. You have counted on that money to be there for you, and contributed to it, and planned your life around it. Though it would be a nice gesture if you don't use it all to pay forward a little to help out. Or contribute funds on their birthdays or something. \n\nMy parents didn't pay for my college. College isn't a guarantee, and scholarships as well as trade schools are always an option. I couldn't afford to attend college until my late 20s, and I was able to get BOG waivers that covered my community college tuition, as well as scholarships. There are so many scholarships out there, there are likely even some they may be eligible for due to being adopted. I also know many people who never went to college and have jobs that pay very well. It certainly isn't a necessity, and so you shouldn't feel guilty whatsoever for keeping your college fund.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your money and like you said, college is expensive and you\u2019ll likely need every bit of it to pay for tuition, books and other expenses. \n\nYour cousins are still young. Their parents, your parents, relatives and cousins can contribute to the college fund.", "INFO: Did their parents/parents parents contribute any of the funds to your college fund?  \nHow well did all the relatives that contributed to your fund know you?  \nDid you consider offering to do the same for them what your relatives did for you growing up? (offer to contribute over the years as their Christmas and Birthdays)", "NTA. I stay confused about the whole \u201cparents paying for their kids\u2019 college funds\u201d thing because in my household, once you turned 18, you had to figure it out. IMO, you\u2019re blessed to have a savings like that in place and every single person who contributed put that money toward YOU. The money was a gift for YOU. College can be done without financial help if one works hard. Your cousins may have to get jobs or apply for grants/loans. Those situations are, by no means, the end of the world.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I suggest you get your parents to set up accounts for them, and contribute as you\u2019re able on Christmas and birthdays.", "You could offer to transfer whatever remains after you've finished college (it would be a nice thing to do) but NTA.  The money was put there for you.", "If your parents adopted them, they\u2019re legally their parents and responsible for them.\n\nWhy do you think \u201ctheir own parents\u201d will help your cosuins if they\u2019re no longer legally required to do?", "NTA, but maybe you could contribute sometimes once you start earning? Just a thought. And be a bit more tactful while turning your parents down. They have a responsibility towards your cousins too and it's probably hard for them to save up as much as they did for you.", "NTA: but maybe once you are graduated from school and set up in a job and apartment and if anything is left over then maybe you can give some of the left overs? Not all but some equally for each sibling?", "NAH, you don't have to give them any money, but it was totally understandable that your parents asked. Have you thought about giving smaller amounts through the years? If they're young, you could contribute once you leave college. You still don't have an obligation, but it would be nice (especially since it would take some stress off your parents, who seem lovely).", "Clearly they don\u2019t have their own parents", "They're around elementary school age, but there's a reason my parents have custody.", "Is op not part of that village? She clearly had no issue making use of it when it benefited her.", "I agree NAH, but to take without giving is an AH move. Some amount of reciprocity of kindness is regularly required. Usually I am very much of the \"gifts are not obligations\" ilk, but many gifts do require at least token gestures of thanks (thank you cards for big wedding gifts, or contributing into a family members edu fund after yours was filled by family members) and not responding in the appropriate way is more assholish than not.\n\n(Edit: i want to be clear that i think once OP is done school they are socially obligated to put $100 in or something. A token amount. If OP is not grateful or humble they can forgo, but it will paint their character correctly to all those who helped them.)", "Why are you trying to attach strings to gifts given to a child? Giving an 8 year old $100 for their birthday doesn't make them responsible for your kids' \ncollege tuition.", "a) no, their parents were never in the financial position to contribute money to the fund.\n\nb) traditionally, birthday gifts in our family (especially monetary) are only given to children from established couples/families.", "Have you looked at the cost of attending college in the last 5 years?  It\u2019s been about 15-20 years since hard work was enough to get through college without either assistance or large loans.", "Honestly, the college I currently attend isn't one I'd have ever dreamed of going to if I didn't have the savings I did. The tuition is absurd and incredibly difficult to pay off if you're going into debt for it.", "My parents adopted them out of necessity - they would have gone into foster care otherwise. It wasn't a happy choice really.", "NAH. Their birth parents are not likely to be able to put any money in a college fund for them and that is now your parents responsibility. You have no obligation to give them money, but it would have been nice if you had. Maybe even a little bit, just as a gesture to welcome your adoptive siblings to your family. Your parents asked you, but also but acknowledge that you totally have the right to say no. They also have a right to be slightly disappointed if kindness and giving is a value that they hold dear. Hopefully they will move past that.", "That is my point, the village should continue its participation and direct it to the next set of children. It would be a kindness for the OP to contribute to the cousins\u2019 fund for birthday and Christmas.  But it\u2019s not on the OP to split their fund 3 ways.", "For a number of reasons (which are largely my problem), I'm not comfortable being a part of that \"village\" for these cousins.", "> Over the years, my parents, ***relatives***, and I've all contributed money in the account.\n\nDid you miss that part. There was no details of what relatives gave, or what the culture/family tradition around it was.  Cause that, to me, reads as relatives we're contributing outside of Birthdays and Christmas since it was mentioned separately, which is why info was asked before making judgement.  It's not attaching strings, it's clarifying that this isn't a \"Fuck you, Got Mine\" situation.", "Then NTA, was leaning that way from the beginning but these just felt like some points needing cleared up for full judgement.", "I sure have. I only ever attended college as a person who lived below the poverty line, though, so I\u2019m not sure I have the same definition of \u201chard work\u201d as other people.", "That money was meant for you. Everyone who contributed to it did so with intentions for you. Your cousins will be fine.", "Do they really \u201cstill have their parents\u201d then?", "The \u201cvillage\u201d helped you only by giving bday money and Christmas money. Not by giving their kids college money to you. You can also be a part of village giving by giving bday and Christmas money to these cousins. That\u2019s all that is required of you. In their old age , your parents took an additional responsibility of 2 kids who have their own parents. That\u2019s noble of them but other than shelter and feeding , they needn\u2019t provide a hefty college fund as well by stealing from yours. The kids are still young so they can earn for the kids. The kids should be grateful that they have 2 sets of parents.", "No you are NTA. \nYou need this college fund right now, your cousins do not. Use your college fund get a good degree and later on when you are in a good place you can help out your cousins. They have time to build it up since they\u2019re in elementary school and should also be able to apply for scholarships/grants. Who knows, they might not even want to go to college and you\u2019re just accruing debt for no reason.", "NTA. The question shouldn\u2019t even have been asked. That\u2019s your money - not just saved for you by your parents but from other gifts to you. It should be used to see you through college and anything left over used to help you get your start. There is no reason, none whatsoever, for you to lose out because your parents decided to adopt two kids. You\u2019ll probably already lose any help they\u2019d have been able to give you after college. Don\u2019t give up what is already yours.", "NTA\n\nThis is your college fund and without a scholarship you are going to need every penny and probably still have to take a part time job to live.\n\nCollege funds for your cousins are the responsibility of whoever has parental custody of them, not you!", "NTA. It\u2019s your money. You shouldn\u2019t even have been asked for it.", "NTA Responsibility for your cousin's college education falls upon your cousin's birth parents, adoptive parents, and your cousins themselves in that order and not upon you AT ALL.", "NTA.

But you seem rather disdainful of the new siblings, which is pretty cold in light of their circumstances.", "NTA, not your child not your problem", "Since they are so much younger after you graduate and if you are in a position for it, you can contribute to their college education accounts.", "NTA - you need the money now\n\nOnce you graduate and start working, maybe you can help them with their funds, like some relatives helped you, but it would be out of generosity and compassion , not obligation!", "NTA\n\nYour parents need to start saving for your cousin's college accounts the same way they saved for yours.  You could contribute modest gifts at birthdays and holidays to add to their accounts.", "Nta", "NTA", "I just commented much the same. No child is \"owed\" their parents funding their college education. Good for them if they're fortunate enough to have parents able and willing to do so, but their parents are under no obligation to do so, whether they can afford it or not.", "Adopting them, and legally becoming their parents and responsible for them, doesn't make them entitled to, or in any way owed, a college education. \n\nJust as thousands upon thousands of other young people have had to do before them, they may just have to get a job and work their way through college like so many others have done, if they wish to pursue higher education.", "If you do contribute, it makes more sense to do so after you get a degree and are working. college is a lot of time and effort and working more than part time is really an additional cause of stress, best if you can avoid it", "Then why are they asking you to share the college fund? They won\u2019t need it for a decade plus.\n\nAre you sure your parents are doing ok financially?", "Usually the adults take care of the children in a village, not the other way around", "These were monetary gifts given to her as a child for holidays and birthdays, along with funds from her parents and her own work that were saved. I didn't get the impression this was a 'let's pay for college' fund for OP by her extended family.", "It was OP money to begin with.", "Absolutely not. This is ridiculous. These monetary GIFTS were for momentous occasions in the OP\u2019s life. They were gifts that she\u2019s presumably already given a \u201ctoken thanks\u201d for. She owes no one anything.", "It\u2019s an unfortunate situation but OP absolutely does not have a \u201csocial obligation\u201d to give these kids money.", "Socially obligated to kids they barely know? Gtfo with that stupid shit \ud83d\ude02", "What do you mean by established couples/families? You wouldn\u2019t give the kids gifts for their funds in the future because of the adoption?", "I disagree. No child is automatically entitled to, or is in any way \"owed\" a college education that's fully or even partially funded by their parents, period.\n\nSure, it's great if you're fortunate enough to have parents that are able and willing to contribute to your ability to fund your higher education, but they certainly aren't obligated to do so. \n\nAnd quite frankly, OP is under no obligation to help out these family members to the detriment of their own educational goals, nor should they feel in the least bit guilty for not doing so.\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "This is a good point. Maybe put aside a bit for each to cover college trip and/or SAT and/or application fees. That would be a nice gesture that might satisfy for your parents."]}
