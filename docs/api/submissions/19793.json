There's another way to look at it, though.

Mom is TA for demanding that you cross those boundaries.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to force you to use your benefits for her.  I will say, places like that expect employees to immediately use their benefits and use them often. It's part of why they offer it. They can pay you less by letting you in for free. They lose nothing by letting you and a +1 go in every day of the week. I will also say I don't see the point of bringing a 5 year old to an amusement park. She'll get to ride 3 rides? 4 maybe? But it might just be easier for you to go along with it since your employer really isn't going to care.", "NTA\n\nShe's trying to take advantage.  Give her an inch and she'll demand non-stop miles.\n\nStand your ground or you may end up looking bad in front of your boss.", "NTA. Your mom just wants to get a free trip for her kid and doesn't care if you will face any consequences. Even if there were no consequences, which there might be, it wouldn't look good to pull something like this on your first week of work.", "NTA I recommend talking to your boss about the details for this benefit. You don't want to lose either the job or this benefit with a worst-case scenario of losing both.", "If you're unsure what the protocol at your workplace is, OP, may I suggest that you ask your supervisor?  They'll have a much better idea about what is permitted and what is not.\n\nNTA for being nervous about this.", "NTA. But please don't ask co-workers. Even if you are friends, they may not really know the rules about this benefit. Get through your orientation and make sure you understand what is acceptable first. I hope you enjoy your first job!", "NTA \n\nYour mom sounds like she's being very pushy and just want a free day out for your sibling (which I get) however you have literally just started the job. \n\nI would speak to a supervisor regarding benefits and state you have a you get sibling and when is the grace period for using benefits. \n\nHeck make it up and say you have to be there for 6 weeks or more before entitled to use the benefits. Do not risk a job you just got because your mom doesn't wanna payout herself for your sibling to have a day out.", "NTA. \n\nOften it is a requirement for the employee to stay with their guest. \n\nAnd your moms behavior at the amusement park will reflect on you. \n\nIf shes trying to make you do this even though you\u2019re not comfortable\u2014is she the type of person who will behave properly at the park?\n\nOr is she be the type of person who is trying to use her sons employee discount to buy food and gets upset when she can\u2019t?\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable you don\u2019t want to go back to the park after working for three days. And it\u2019s reasonable as a new employee you don\u2019t wanna break rules by getting her in and leaving (assuming that\u2019s a rule). \n\nHow about \u201cmom, I really want to all go together so we can enjoy it as a family. But I\u2019m going to be too tired to do it this weekend. Can we schedule for a different weekend that\u2019s good for all of us?\u201d  \n\nBut if your benefits say you\u2019re allowed to go to the park for free immediately\u2014you aren\u2019t abusing anything by going. If they didn\u2019t want you using it right away, they could have easily made a 30 or 90 day probation/waiting period before you could have that benefit.", "NTA. You just started. After a little while you\u2019ll get a feel for the practical scope of the benefits. Your mom is an asshole for pressuring you to put your job at risk (and for trying to make you go to your workplace on your day off just so your family can save some cash).", "NTA. You sound really sensible so don't let her make you feel like you're overacting. I'm quessing this is one of your first jobs,  so it makes sense for you to be more cautious. Once you've settled in,  you might feel fine about letting them in without you,  but go at your own pace.", "NTA your mom is being unreasonable and not showing a good example.", "Not an abuse of the benefits, but an abuse of him because he has to be present.", "I am guessing it's because they won't be there which is what the benefit states. Employee and a friend. Not sure, though.", "This is basically what I was thinking. What your mom is asking seems fairly normal. However, I suggest waiting until you find out more about this perk and how other employees use it. Of course, even if everyone else does something, it doesn't mean you have to. \n\nI think your mom is being an asshole for trying to bully you into something you're not comfortable with - and during your first week of work! Until you figure this out, she can either wait until you want to go or she can pay full price.

That way you would feel more comfortable and can set the boundary if what she is asking would break them.", "You're NTA. Good grief, it's your first week. There will be other weekends they can take advantage of your benefits. Though I wouldn't say it's abuse. It doesn't sound like you'd be breaking any rules. But your mom needs to be back off and take *not this weekend, maybe another* for an answer. It's still your workplace, and it's understandable that you want a day away from it.", "NTA- Sorry mom that I'm not willing to bend the rules. It's hard to get jobs these days and a lot of minimum or close to jobs have tight management. Mostly bc they cant afford the most and high turn over at the same time.", "NTA \n\nI used to work for an amusement park run by a mouse and one of the rules of using a particular benefit (getting other people into the park for free) was that you had to be with them. I'd double check the policy (which should be in your employee handbook if you were given one) to see what it states verbatim and then present that to your mom. \n\nAnd then, just to dot your i's and cross your t's, I'd sit down with your manager if you're able to just let them know there may be a possibility of people trying to claim your work benefits of free park entry while you're working and that this is not something you gave your okay to. If you have a cool manager, they'll be on your side.", "As every airline employee with a buddy pass has learned the hard way, how your guests behave reflects on you. Until you are more comfortable on the job, I wouldn\u2019t. In fact, I\u2019d take my sister first for a short visit in the kids section and not take mom. Moms entitled and the first time she pulls trying to cut the line or not pay or whatever, it reflects on you. Tread carefully.", "Info:\n\nDo you get a certain number of free admissions because you work there? (That was the situation when my son worked at an amusement park a couple of summers ago.)\n\nIf so, no reason not to use them, they are part of your job.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get this - if your mom is asking you to sneak them in or something - then I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable either.", "Jeez they could at least let you settle in and get to know the place/people first. NTA", "NTA. My first job was at a movie theater. I was able to see movies for free with friends/family during the week and as long as it wasn't like a major blockbuster. My mom and younger brother came in to see whatever while I was working. They got to see it free. My mom then left her and my brothers trash all under the seat knowing that I would be the one to clean it and knowing that there were MULTIPLE TRASH CANS ON YOUR WAY OUT OF THE THEATER. Do I expect randoms to do that shit? Of course. But my mom literally instructed my brother to just leave all his nachos and shit after he actually tried to throw it away. Her reasoning after I asked why tf she'd make her daughter's job harder was that \"it's your job anyway.\" Everytime she asked about free movies after that I told her my manager said no or that it was already sold out. If you're not comfortable having your fam use your benefits yet, then don't. This is work. Where you have to go all the time, not to have fun, but to do your job.", "NTA OP.  Your mom needs to remember that \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't think anyone will care if you \"abuse\" your benefits. I guess you can just tell them to wait a month or so.", "When I read this I thought that mom was saying OP should take her sister - since it's employee and 'a' friend. \n\nSpending your day off at the place you work with your 12 years younger sister does no sound like fun to me.", "NTA - are you sure that you are able to use this perk yet even? I had friends who worked summers at an amusement park and they had to wait until 30 days of employment before they could use their friend pass benefit. Could be a good way to get Mom to back off?", "NTA but maybe tell you mom it\u2019s not a no forever, just a no for this weekend. Then maybe schedule a day the three of you can go. \n\nI worked at a Six Flags back when I was in high school for a summer. They had so many employees and visitors and you couldn\u2019t even run into someone that knew you, if you tried.", "NTA. The thing about these types of benefits is that are putting you at your place of work, which a lot of people aren\u2019t interested in. When I worked at a movie theater, I rarely used my perk of free movies and when I did I almost always went to a different theater in the chain. I don\u2019t want to be at my shitty job when I\u2019m off the clock, even if it\u2019s to see a free movie. Somehow I\u2019m going to get pulled into work related talk. I\u2019m at work. It\u2019s inevitable. Or as in your case, I was just at this place for multiple days in a row. I don\u2019t wanna go back on my day off.", "NTA.Some places take using your employee benefits pretty seriously to prevent abuse and some places don't,it depends. \n\nBut I wouldn't take a chance,especially if it's a brand new job. If something happens you're the only one getting in trouble,no them.", "NTA.  I have similar benefits, and in my case the company is very explicit about how I can and cannot use my benefits.  Before you do anything, read carefully their terms and conditions, and just assume that if you violate them that you are likely to be fired -- especially as a new hire.", "NTA but have you thought about just asking your boss if your mom\u2019s request is a permissible use of your benefit?? I", "Ahh I hope your first day at work went well! Good on you getting that job. You have every right to just want some breathing space to learn your job and all it entails. Your Mum needs to back off and let you get on with that. NTA!", "Mom's plan sounds like a great way to lose a job.", "It is if OP doesn't accompany them to the park. The perk is for the employee and a guest."]}
