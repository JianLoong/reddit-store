She and I always had our issues. In our adult years we were not especially close. She was always aware that my son Luca (16) is trans (female to male). Socially Luca transitioned at a young age. He has always known who he was meant to be and it was rough for him in school where everyone knew so we moved when he was 6 to make it so everyone knew him as just Luca. A couple of years after that my sister moved to the same city with her husband and her stepdaughter Anna (also now 16). She said they had wanted a fresh start after becoming a family. She wanted us to be closer. What she didn't tell me was they moved because Anna was such a bully that a fresh start was their only choice. Anna has been mean to Luca at the best of times. So I told my sister not to mention anything to Anna about Luca being trans. I didn't even know her whole history at the time. Just that she wasn't very nice to Luca. My sister said she wouldn't.\n\nYears later she went back on that. A few months ago actually to be precise. I had already put a lot more distance back between my sister and us. But Anna started bullying Luca more intensely some months ago (though it did slowly get worse prior and I was always involved with the school trying to end it). Anna then told Luca that \"her dad's bitch of a wife told her she was the bitch wife's niece and not her nephew and she was really a girl\". Luca tried dealing with it without telling my husband and myself. But then he was left with no choice, it got so bad.\n\nWe stepped in and spoke to the school. I tried to be calm and just go no contact with my sister. I tried to make sure it was the end of the bullying. It was not. Anna was expelled from the high school after an incident before the end of semester. My sister attempted to speak to me about it all and I lost my shit on her. I told her she had destroyed Luca's life with telling her little brat of a stepchild and she started yelling that Anna is family and deserves to know and would have felt left out. I told her I did not care about Anna. She was not mine or my son's family. That she is a bullying. She has been bullying for a long time. She made my son's life harder and for that reason I would never give a shit about where she's coming from. I told her to stay away from me and keep Anna away from Luca or there would be hell to pay. I told her expulsion should be a huge wakeup call to how bad Anna is. My sister told me I was evil for talking that way.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688312765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14orh4s/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_care_about_her/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do fear you take your feelings towards your sister into account when it comes to her step daughter. You don\u2019t like your sister and that\u2019s fine.

Your sister should want to protect your son as a nephew in the same way she\u2019s demanding you protect her step daughter as a niece.\n\nIf Anna had been open and tried to be nice (not perfect, but tried) you might have developed a relationship with her to feel like she\u2019s family.", "NTA\n\nGold star parenting. \ud83c\udf1f  You're a rock star, and there are parents around the world who could learn from you about going to bat for their kids and not backing down.
