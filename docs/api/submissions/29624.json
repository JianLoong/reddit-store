She asked our dad to walk her down the aisle and dance with her at the wedding. My mom and stepdad were hoping she would have both dad and stepdad do these things because stepdad has been in her life since she was 4 and I was 6. Apparently mom asked her and my sister said it felt like a better idea to just have dad do it. Mom asked her why and she said because he's her dad.\n\nMom tried to convince my dad to tell my sister she should have \"both fathers\" do it and that he would be honored to share the role with the man who stepped up for us during mom's parenting time (50/50 timeshare when we were kids). She apparently told dad all the stuff stepdad had done over the years and how he loves us like we're his kids but has always been second to him (dad). Dad told her he was not going to encourage my sister to do that and she made her decision.\n\nWhen mom couldn't get dad on board she asked me to talk to my sister and convince her. I heard all about how much stepdad has done for us but especially my sister who doesn't remember a life without him in it and yet she has always acted like she only has one dad and not two. She said it would a beautiful gift for my stepdad for me to try and she knows that deep down my sister just doesn't want to upset our dad, and she would probably have asked both if that wasn't a concern. She said as the big brother she felt like I was the next best person to have this talk with her.\n\nI told my mom this was not my place and I was not interfering. She told me I should want my sister to have the perfect wedding and this would make the wedding extra special, having both dads by her side as she walks to her future husband. She said it was my place and pointed out how as a brother it's \"100% my place\". I told her who my sister walks down the aisle with or dances with is absolutely none of my business because my sister is a grown woman and I will not interfere in this.\n\nMom got so mad at me and she said I could have done this for them (aka her and my stepdad).

I have known the bride since high school and know her and her mom have a terrible relationship but have been working on it over the past two years. When we went to the dress fitting, her mom asked her several times who she was walking down the aisle with (dad of the bride molested her when she was a child so she has little to no relationship with him and did not want him walking her down the isle). Her mom insisted she have someone walk her down the aisle. I stepped in and said the bride should walk herself since there was no one she wanted to give that role to and she had a beautiful dress, it felt like she should have the moment to herself, and that\u2019s exactly what the bride wanted. \n\nLong story short, the mother of the bride ended up walking my friend down the aisle, after making us (the wedding party) and the guests wait for an additional 20 minutes because what she really wanted was to walk her daughter down the aisle. After everything was said and done, my friend told me after the fact that she only allowed her mom to walk her down the aisle because she was making a scene (literally arguing with her in front of us and the guests as we were about to start walking) and because they were already running late and needed to start walking and her mom wasn\u2019t budging. The groom and bride were rightfully very upset over this and it just isn\u2019t what the bride wanted ultimately. \nI was also upset because the bride had made herself very clear about this from day one but the mother still got what she wanted and nearly ruined the entire day over it. \n\nSo my point is that you\u2019re not the asshole for not getting involved in a situation that doesn\u2019t include you. My dad passed away a few months before my husband and I got married so I cancelled the entire wedding. There was no one else I would have given the honor of walking me down the aisle. That role was for my dad and my dad only, no one could do it and I didn\u2019t want anyone else to do it. \n\nYour mom doesn\u2019t want your sister to \u201chave the best wedding\u201d, she wants to do this so she can take control and make her husband happy.

He was there to give me a place to live when my mom threw a fit and kicked me out at 19 because I was dating my now wife (I am also an AFAB person), while my stepdad just went along with it. No, my father wasn't a saint by any means- and he has made mistakes of course. Failed in other ways. And I do love my stepdad, and he is a good person. But no one is perfect. \n\nMy stepdad is a good man. He paid for our health insurance (because it was better than what my dad could get, and my dad didn't make much money), was nice to us, always called us his kids (he did treat us differently than his bio kids, but I don't think it was intentional). But he is not my Dad. I have a Dad, and I didn't want to replace him. I felt deprived of my time with him as a child (not because he was unfit- he couldn't afford to fight my mom for custody and the judge they got heavily favored women) and I didn't want to share the experience of my dad walking me down the aisle with my stepdad. My dad likes my stepdad and would have shared the experience if I'd asked, but I didn't want that. My mom has always tried to force my brother and I to see our stepdad as a dad. To the point of asking us if we wanted to change our names, and trying to see if my dad would sign off his rights so our stepdad could adopt us, and trying to make us call him \"dad\" so we \"wouldn't confuse our baby siblings\" (we did not, and they were not). \n\nI wound up eloping anyway (not due to this, it was circumstances out of our control) but this was the plan if we had a wedding. My stepdad and mom tried to guilt me into letting him walk me down the aisle because \"He's done so much for you, you barely saw your dad, he was more of a parent\" etc.. And you know what that did? It made me resent them, and it damaged my relationship with my stepdad. I see him as my kid's grandparent, but not as my parent anymore. I don't feel close to him at all, because he made me feel like a possession, or a trophy to be won. \n\nSo unless your mom and stepdad want to risk that with your sister, they need to back off.

My father passed when I was 12 so this honor is very personal one for me so I get the daughter wanting it to be her real dad if he's there.  Maybe they could both \"give her away\"? Maybe he walks her down and hands her to the step dad to \"give\" to the groom? I get your mom's point as that is a long time in a girls life to have nothing special especially if he's helping pay. (Not saying he is or that's part of my reason but he's involved is what I'm saying). Goggle or add something separate/special if you don't like this ideas. She's an important part of step dads life and he just wants to be part of the special day.

If it was something that was traditionally done by the mother of the bride and rolls were reversed would mom feel the same way about her and step mom walking her down the aisle? Sister Might want to sit down and talk with step dad and let him know intentionally and both have the opportunity to discuss it. If the relationship is important to her. Not necessarily to consider his point of view but just to kind of validate each other's feelings and preserve the relationship. Sometimes people feel more hurt because they feel like the person doesn't care enough about them to even talk to them about it. Than they are from the actual perceived issue. I feel like it might have more to do with your mom's feelings and waning him included than him actually caring anyways.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is wrong.", "NTA. Not at all. It would be different if OP's father was a deadbeat dad who wasn't there for his children. From the post, the father is not that.\n\nI personally would find it very disrespectful to have the stepfather intrude on that intimate father daughter activity. I believe OP's mother is out of line and pushing her husband into this dynamic. The mother is selfish. Stepdad isn't blood. Maybe he is a good man and did well in the role of stepdad. That doesn't change the fact that the sister has an active father who deserves his opportunity to walk his daughter down the wedding aisle.", "Also, not that it doesn\u2019t happen, but traditionally only a non-parent takes on the \u201cwalk down the aisle\u201d role at a wedding if the real parent is either dead or not on speaking terms with the wedding couple. Dad is alive, well, and in good relation with the bride. So in my opinion not only would it be rude to the sister of OP to step in on behalf of the stepdad, it would be disrespectful to OPs dad, making it seem like he was less of a parent because he\u2019d then have to share a role he traditionally wouldn\u2019t share if step dad weren\u2019t around. If bride really felt that both dad and step dad were equal to her, then she would\u2019ve asked both on her own. She only asked her dad, keeping with traditional ideas.
