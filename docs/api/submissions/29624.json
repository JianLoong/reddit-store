She asked our dad to walk her down the aisle and dance with her at the wedding.

Apparently mom asked her and my sister said it felt like a better idea to just have dad do it. Mom asked her why and she said because he's her dad.\n\nMom tried to convince my dad to tell my sister she should have \"both fathers\" do it and that he would be honored to share the role with the man who stepped up for us during mom's parenting time (50/50 timeshare when we were kids). She apparently told dad all the stuff stepdad had done over the years and how he loves us like we're his kids but has always been second to him (dad). Dad told her he was not going to encourage my sister to do that and she made her decision.\n\nWhen mom couldn't get dad on board she asked me to talk to my sister and convince her. I heard all about how much stepdad has done for us but especially my sister who doesn't remember a life without him in it and yet she has always acted like she only has one dad and not two. She said it would a beautiful gift for my stepdad for me to try and she knows that deep down my sister just doesn't want to upset our dad, and she would probably have asked both if that wasn't a concern. She said as the big brother she felt like I was the next best person to have this talk with her.\n\nI told my mom this was not my place and I was not interfering. She told me I should want my sister to have the perfect wedding and this would make the wedding extra special, having both dads by her side as she walks to her future husband. She said it was my place and pointed out how as a brother it's \"100% my place\". I told her who my sister walks down the aisle with or dances with is absolutely none of my business because my sister is a grown woman and I will not interfere in this.\n\nMom got so mad at me and she said I could have done this for them (aka her and my stepdad).

Your mom tried to guilt trip you into doing it because she failed to convince your sister to do it mom's way and failed to convince your dad to get your sister to go along with mom's plan.  You could get involved *if* you wanted to, but you know this isn't your responsibility nor should you pressure your sister into going against what she wants.\n\nThere was no compromise that you could have offered your mother.

Not drama you want to get involved in.", "NTA\n\nYour mother put the idea to your sister and your sister said no. That should have been the end of it.\n\nYour mother applying pressure through other people is not likely to make the day more special for your sister and I doubt your stepdad would be happy knowing your sister had to be manipulated in to it.\n\nHowever, I do see why your mother would want it.", "NTA. You are absolutely right and it\u2019s no one\u2019s decision but your sister\u2019s. Your mom and stepdad want to make her day about themselves.

I know there are certainly step parents who become the de facto parent in cases of death or parental abandonment, but this doesn\u2019t seem the case at all here.  If your sister wants her (involved) biological father to escort her down the aisle, that\u2019s that.  \n\nI also have so many stories of essentially absent fathers who crawl out of the woodwork when their daughters are getting married demanding they be given the escort honor or else\u2026. its pretty sad.", "Nta it's not your place to interfere with your sister's decision, no matter what your mom says.", "NTA. Your sister has the full right to decide who gets to walk her down the aisle and dance with her at her wedding reception. She has chosen her own dad. Mom needs to butt out. Your mom seems very insistent, I guess the \n\n>this would make the wedding extra specia\n\npart is for her and stepdad, not for your sister. I hope you stick to your guns.

So, do you want dad being the only one to walk you down the aisle or do you want stepdad to do that too? Again, I\u2019ve been told that my job as your big brother is to talk to you about it and to make sure you actually chose what you want to, when you choose what ~~mom thinks is best~~ you yourself really want, I invite my baby sister to some ice cream, but if you stay firm with your _obviously_ pressed choice, you have to live with me not further involving myself in this situation that so clearly is my business.\u201c\n\nThen send your mom a screenshot and say you stepped in and did your duty", "NTA.  Your mom is way the hell out of line trying to recruit you to guilt-trip your sister.", "NTA - your mom keeps insisting you guys have 2 dads, but you only have 2 dads if YOU feel that way.\n\nSure, the guy did a lot for you guys, and that should be appreciated,  but your mom doesn't get to decide *how* it's appreciated. \n\nIf she wants her husband to feel appreciated,  SHE should do something to show him that she appreciates him instead of bullying her kids into it.", "If stepdad was truly good to the bride, I feel bad for him BUT it\u2019s about how the bride feels.

I bet this is stressing her out.", "He wants to do it and I wouldn't be surprised if he's grumbling to mom behind the scenes or crying to her about it which is making mom go even harder on the topic.", "Our dad never remarried. Stepdad also never had to take over as dad because we didn't have a present one. Even on mom's time dad was still present if we had anything going on like sports games or school plays. For mom, though, she sees it as we still had two dads even if we didn't lose one. I can't speak for my sister but I never saw her husband as my second dad. But mom wanted that.", "she answered that question already he\u2019s simply not her dad.", "Maybe my sister just doesn't feel the same about our stepdad and therefore doesn't want him to share in the role with dad?", "NTA She'd approach your stepfather if she wanted him. It's her wedding, like you stated.", "Not even. He can be the best stepdad in the world, but he is still stepdad and dad is still in the picture.

People forcing step parents to be mandatory viewed on the same level as a biological parent with whom you have a stable and healthy relationship with is a fast way to estrangement. This post doesn\u2019t detail the level of involvement bio das has, but OP hasn\u2019t insinuated its less than stepdad given the 50/50 comment so\u2026 I can only assume the relationship to be amicable and healthy there. Which, if she never developed the feelings that stepdad was also a \u2018real\u2019 dad in her heart instead of a pleasant man who was married to her mom and spent time with her, then it stands to reason he wouldn\u2019t be the one walking her.

That your dad was never out of the picture. You are doing the right thing by not getting involved. It was your sister's decision, and it sounds like she made the right one. Your mom may have the fantasy that her kids had two dads, but it's not a delusion that is shared by you and your sister. Maybe you need to talk to your mom, and explain to her that although you and your sister are happy that your mom found someone that she could spend the rest of her life with and that she's happy with, that does not mean that you guys are obligated to think of him as a second dad. That while you respect him as the man who is taking care of your mom, that does not put him in a dad role. Just my two cents ( well because of the cost of living it's a half a cent now).", "No that's not what she said. When her mom asked why she asked her dad to walk her down the aisle, the sister said because he's my dad. That does not answer the question I had as to why she didn't also ask her stepdad to walk down the aisle with her and her dad, or why she didn't ask her stepdad to have a dance with her after her dad.", "And that\u2019s okay if that\u2019s what it is.

Seems pretty clear and straightforward to me.", "\"... my sister said it felt like a better idea to just have dad do it. ***Mom asked her why and she said because he's her dad.***\"\n\nAsked and answered.\n\nMom got a perfectly fine answer, she just doesn't want to accept it.", "If the bio dad was an active involved dad in the life of the kids then sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter at all how much the step dad did did and contributed. \u201cDad\u201d could simply have been one figure and one figure only as far as the kids emotional attachment \n\nIt can suck for step parents but that\u2019s part of the cost you pay when you take that job.
