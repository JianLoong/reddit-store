Being a landlord comes with lots of responsibility and liability. Would they be down to let you do background checks and check credit scores? Would the sign a lease and term agreements?\nI am someone that whenever it comes to money and family, you don't mix them. Being kind a letting them live with you could start off fine but quickly escalate to being taken advantage of. \n\nMy friend's kid was playing with their bathroom sinks and plugged them while running water which proceeded to flood their house and cause water damage. Now all drain plugs are removed in the house. Little things happen quickly and can be costly to fix. \n\nI would absolutely say no to any family living with me, unless they had a lease agreement and even then with very standard terms.

If it was just for a month while they're inbetween places, I'd be more likely to say yes. But an ongoing living arrangement - who even expects that?!

Unless they had a seperate area, like a huge in law apartment and the contract was the same as it would be for another tenant. HELL no. \n\n\nI have been with my fiance for 10+ years and we aren't married (I am the one who put off marriage moreso for tax reasons, we own a house and have a child together.
