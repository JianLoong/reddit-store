I didn't go to his funeral, never saw his dead body, never said goodbye. 30 years later, I still startle and expect to see him when I smell pipe smoke, and I feel new pain each and every time he doesn't appear.\n\nMy mom died when I was 15, and I saw her body at the hospital. My dad made sure I saw it. I went to the funeral, I went to the viewing. It was agony. But sounds, smells, sights which remind me of her make me happy. They never give me pain.\n\nI'm so, so sorry your mom died. So sorry. But staying away from the funeral won't bring her back, and missing the chance to see that she has died, missing the chance to say a real farewell, will hurt you a lot and for the rest of your life. And no matter what, you will start being sad soon. You will grieve. Sweetheart, you're already grieving. Trying to short-circuit that is actually really bad for your mental health. You're not fine, you're numb. That will go away eventually and you will hurt so much more if you never say goodbye, if you try to prevent yourself from really understanding that she's gone and from grieving her loss.\n\nMaybe if you can't bring yourself to sit through the funeral, your dad could arrange a short private viewing of your mom's remains for you. Go, get it over with, and hold on to your father when you stop feeling numb. I understand why you want to hold on to the numbness, but frankly you're in shock right now, and shock does not last forever. It doesn't even last for very long. Don't alienate your family over this; *tell them what you've told us.* Explain why you don't want to go to the funeral. Ask them to hold you while you grieve, even if that's something your family doesn't usually do.\n\nMy thoughts are with you; I grieve with you. Yes, that's a Spock quote, but I've never found a better way to say it.", "NTA.\n\nHi! I\u2019m a therapist so I here are my clinical thoughts. You\u2019re right, by not going to the funeral, you can delay the devastating sadness. But it\u2019s just a delay, and that delay could be a day, a week, or a month, but trust that it\u2019s going to hit you. The grieving and sadness are non-negotiable.\n\nFunerals are meant to be a chance to say goodbye, to grieve with other people who loved your mom, and to provide a space to unapologetically feel (or not feel) everything. The funeral is for you, to start moving through the emotions that come with this.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You don\u2019t have to go, but if your reason is to pretend and ignore, that won\u2019t last very long.", "Oh sweetheart, you\u2019re NTA. No one is. But please go. You don\u2019t even know how it might help you. You are going to meet and receive love from people who knew every version of your mom, including the ones you didn\u2019t get to meet. At the end of the day, you will know your mother more fully. And you will gain parts of her that you didn\u2019t have before. This is how we keep them with us - by knowing them. Remembering them. Speaking their name. Meeting with those who loved them, too. You have to be unfairly strong, because it\u2019s your future self who will thank you. And your future self is your mother\u2019s child: care for you with the same foresight as your mother would if she were here.", "NTA, but, trust me when I say that you'll regret it if you don't. Your Mom is never coming back physically, but she will live on in the thoughts and memories of those who loved her, and those she loved. At the funeral you'll be surrounded by these people and you can comfort each other , and begin the grieving process which really can't be avoided indefinitely. Yes, it's hard now. But time will heal you.", " NAH. The only AHs in this scenario are those relatives who say you don\u2019t care. You are still in shock about this great loss and that is not the same as not grieving. I hope for both you and your father\u2019s sake that in 3 days you do find strength to attend the funeral to support your dad. But if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t feel guilty. We all grieve differently.", "I'm sorry for your loss, but, honey, the reality is that your mother is not coming back. You can try to pretend she will, but she won't.  \nIt's a normal thing to feel sad ; forbidding to yourself to feel that way is the unhealthy thing. Sadness is not a threat to your mental health ; sometimes it's a relief that helps you move forward later.  \nI don't think you're an AH, and it's very clear you care about your mom. I think you're a 14yo and it's a complicated thing to deal with. I hope you find someone to talk about it with, in your family or outside of it. NAH.", "YTA, in the softest way.  I am trained as grief counsellor,  you need to go.  You are still holding out hope that she is alive and this is normal, but if you dont go, this can lead to so much more problems down the road.\n\nYou need to go for  your own mental health, you need to mourn  your mother passing, you need to feel that pain to heal.  It is hard I know and  honestly you are too young and you need to listen to your dad.  Oh I wish I could hold your hand and help you in this hard moment in life.   \n\n\nI would also  recommended that you find a book called Brother Lionheart by Astrid Lindgren, it is often given to children  who are grieving.", "It'll be the hardest thing you ever do but you should go. It's easier to go and regret it than to not go and regret it. The first one is over in a day. To not go ... Well you can't take that back and it's with you for life. \n\nJust go.", "My mother died when I was nine.  I wasn't given the chance to go to her funeral, and I wish very much that I had been able to attend.  I've seen photographs, and I think it might have been quite comforting to see that outpouring of love and affection for my mother.  It was bewildering and hard to believe that she was gone and never coming back, and I honestly do understand your feeling of not wanting that horrible confirmation.  But I think you will regret it, if you don't go.  You will come to terms with the situation in your own time, and of course you know in your heart that you must do so, but it could well be that recognising that other people feel the loss too will actually help you.\n\nI've experienced three important funerals in the last three years, and at each one I have learned things about the deceased that I had never known, even though I knew all these people for many years\u2014and it was nice to find out these things.  Every person has a different relationship with everybody else, and these different perspectives can tell you things you'll be surprised by and glad to know.  You're at the age when you were just recognising your mother as a person rather than simply as Mom (I hadn't quite got to that stage), and learning more about the person you knew could be a comfort to you.\n\nYour family members are wrong (and foolish) to accuse you of not caring.  It can be really hard to feel when something so mind-numbingly awful has happened.  That's part of the reason why we traditionally have funerals\u2014to provide a formulaic way of saying a formal goodbye.  They're also an opportunity to share happy memories.  I really think you could benefit from attending, and it would also comfort your Dad to have you there.  He lost her too.  Try, if you can, to attend, not just for your own sake but for the sake of other people who cared about your mother and who think it's important.  Doing the right thing can be its own reward.\n\nI wish I could hug you.  NTA, of course, but I think you're making the wrong decision.", "So sorry for your loss.\n\nI think you're old enough to make this decision for yourself, and please ignore anybody in your life who tries to measure love by attendance -or otherwise - at a funeral. They're trying to guilt you and that's not fair.\n\nHowever, I would urge you to have a really proper conversation with your dad so that you know you've considered all the angles. If he can't have that conversation then get a family friend along to help you all have a fair and blame-free discussion. By doing this, you and your dad will have shared your views and will understand each other a little better.\n\nNTA, of course.", "YTA to yourself if  you don't go.\n\n\"He said that I'd regret it in the future \"\n\nDad is correct.  \n\n\"if I don't go then she might not be dead and she might still come back.\"\n\nThis is very unhealthy.", "First of all, you are not an asshole, your too young still, and second of all, you are still in shock. You are actually in protective mode, not wanting to acknowledge your trama/pain is creating a safe space for yourself.  I can totally relate.  I lost a son and sort of did the same thing you are doing, but it would be a disservice to yourself and the relationship you had with your mother if you don't go, and you will regret it.  I am extremely sorry for the loss of your mother, I hope you will help yourself by seeking out therapy to help deal with this significant loss.  Sending you nothing but positive vibes and I pray you can find your peace.", "My man if you don't go you'll truly regret it in the future,  it's going to be hard,  and you shouldn't have to go through such a thing at your age,  but say goodbye.\n\nIt'll hurt now but it already does,  it'll be a comfort down the road, I promise.", "I am not going to render judgment.  You should be talking to a grief counselor and not a bunch of people on Reddit.", "NTA. And sorry for your loss.\n\nIt is up to you, if you want to say good bye now or at any other time - alone. But what you are feeling right now is not healthy either. You lost someone and you will feel sad at some point. Now you are functioning to keep going.\n\nAre you able to talk about this to someone? A therapeut?", "NAH and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your mom. I think you should go because it will give you the closure you need. I know you\u2019re in a bit of shock but you have to let the feelings in. You have to grieve for your own sake. Your mom is gone whether you go to the funeral or not. And you might regret it if you don\u2019t say goodbye. Plus your dad might need you there. I\u2019m so sorry sweetheart, I know this hurts.", "NAH. But grieving and mourning rituals are important. Totally get the part about the funeral making this loss real, but that\u2019s gonna happen if you are there or not. If you\u2019re there, you\u2019re with other people who love you and your mom, and can hold you up physically, mentally, and emotionally. If you don\u2019t want to talk this out with your dad right this minute, is there someone outside your immediate family you can talk to? Maybe a teacher or a friend\u2019s parent? Someone who is on team you. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom. It\u2019s totally ok and normal to be feeling whatever it is you are feeling right now - numb, sad, pissed off, scared, whatever. Grief is hard and there\u2019s no avoiding it - it will just leak out in a million other ways. But there are people out there who can help you figure out how you keep on getting up every day. Please talk to another adult in your life about how you\u2019re feeling and let them help you. Sending you good thoughts. And this sounds weird but drink lots of water because grief is also real real dehydrating, even if you aren\u2019t letting yourself cry.", "I didn't go to my aunt's funeral 4 yrs ago she was a second mum to my daughter and meant to world to me. I regret every second of it she is my last thought of every day and I hate myself for not saying good bye. I didn't want to I wasn't ready and now I never can. Please don't make the same mistake \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. your feelings are totally valid and i completely get it. but your dad is right, you will regret it.\n\nyou *can* delay the grief, yes, but that's all it will do. the grief will hit you. funerals are there to get closure and say goodbye. like you say, that means she's never coming back. which is the truth. it's really really hard, but you will need to accept that, and it's better to do that with others who are also grieving and going through the same thing.", "Trust me, you have to attend your mother's funeral. It's important to say the last goodbye to you mom. Yes, you might get sad and start crying but that's okay. YTA to yourself because you will regret your decision in the future. Take care OP and I am so sorry for your loss.", ">This is probably gonna make me sound insane but if I go then that means she is dead and definitely never coming back but if I don't go then she might not be dead and she might still come back,\n\nInsane? No. No, no... Not insane. But it's also absolutely not emotionally healthy (imo! I'm not a therapist and wtf do I actually know).  \n\n\nYou do need to accept that she IS gone, and ISN'T coming back.   \n\n\nBUT, how you choose to do that is your own journey. If you think this will be easier for you by not going to the funeral, then that is understandable.\n\nBut it may be helpful in MANY ways for you to \"say goodbye\" and get some CLOSURE. That is what your dad is likely referring to.   \n\n\nThat said, consider the others' in your family. You don't think that maybe any of them (especially your dad?) may want your presence and support there? You aren't in this alone, and neither are the other people who lost your mom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may not feel anything now, but you also may get smashed in the face by grief like a metric tonne of bricks in the near future.  \n\n\nNAH. But really give it some thought and make SURE you don't want to go to the funeral. Because it's not a decision you can undo. Once the funeral is over, it's over.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I agree that you may regret not going to the funeral and it may be helpful to help your brain wrap itself around the reality of her passing.  That said, no one should be making you feel bad about your desire not to go and it's very normal to feel numb for awhile after someone close to you dies.  Grief is normal, natural and trying to avoid it will only cause you bigger problems down the road. Feel your feelings and  I highly recommend seeing if  there is a grief counselor in your area to help you walk through this experience as those around you are also grieving and may not be able to help as much as they want to.", "I'm sorry for your loss.  Search your soul and do what feels right for you. No judgements.", "NAH \n\nIt sounds like you can't face the finality of the funeral.\n\nHowever it is important to your father that you go.\n\nYou need to speak to him.", "NTA however you aren\u2019t dealing with the reality of the situation. Your mom is gone and she isn\u2019t coming back and sooner or later it will hit you (whether you go or not) and yes your dad is right that when that happens you will likely regret not going to her funeral.

Maybe think about it a little more.", "I'm not going to call you an AH but I think you should go.  The whole point is to feel your grief.  You can't avoid it forever.  That's just going to cause you problems.", "NTA for having your reasons while grieving a fresh loss. But I think your dad is right. You will regret not going in the future.", "My dad always said funerals weren't for the deceased but for the living that knew and loved the deceased", "I'm sorry for your loss. You don't sound insane, but you sound like you're in total denial. I can't blame me you, but yeah, it's not healthy. I also think you'll regret not going. You're so young, you shouldn't go through this tough time alone. Hope you have people close to you that can help you and be of emotional support. Also, don't be afraid of seeking professional help, like seeing a therapist to help with your grief process.", "I am so so so sorry for your loss. \n\nI understand that what you are going through is incredibly difficult and that part of you wants to avoid it by not going, to pretend that it's not happening. But I believe that it is important that you go. It might be painful but it will also be cathartic, it will help you in your process of grieving and healing from your loss. I know in retrospect that it was incredibly important for me when my mum died. Think of a person that you would like by your side, someone you could lean on (your dad, another family member, or one of your friends), and ask them to stand by you and help you through it.\n\nAgain, I am really really sorry for your loss\n\nSending you a big hug <3", "NTA- but I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t been to many funerals. \n\nThey are about listening to stories about her life, see her through others eyes and giving her remains the respect she deserves. \n\nStopping doing something because it will make you sad isn\u2019t any better for your mental health than ignoring the whole situation and hoping it will go away. That\u2019s not a good pattern to start so early in your life. \n\nGo to the funeral, see family and celebrate her life.", "NTA, but you're in denial. I think you probably need to attend the funeral, realize she really is gone, and allow yourself to grieve. Ignore the BS about not caring about your mom.

But there is a grieving process, and trying to escape it won't be good for you in the end.", "Oh kiddo, NTA. However yeah your dad is right, if you don\u2019t go to the funeral you will probably will regret it in the long term because you won\u2019t get that chance to say goodbye. In the short term? Yeah it\u2019s going to be awful but it\u2019s better to be sad now than to let the pain fester. Also have someone to talk to, preferably a therapist but a friend or a family member who you trust can help too.", "I am so sorry for your loss.

I would say that like, at some point it is worth doing your own thing in honour of your mum but it doesn't have to be right now. As for the not coming back, I regularly go and chat to my mums ashes where we buried them and there are still moments for a second I forget she's dead and I can't just call her or text her.

Grief is no joke, and it feels horrible and heart wrenching. \nIt can make you angry too and that's ok.\n\nYou cannot run from it though. \n\nYou may also regret not being there, for your family and for your mum. You'd know best what she would have wanted and whether or not she'd want you there with your family. Sometimes the choice that honours your loved one most is a painful choice.\n\nThere's no real right or wrong answers, but you will experience grief and it will be horrible, but the hope is that rather than cling to that horrible feeling you can cling to what you love about her.\n\nMy sisters kids know all about my brothers who have passed away even though they never met them, we share their essence in stories and so their memory is very much alive.\n\nGood luck OP, sorry for your loss.\nIt will lbe hard, and you'll grow and get stronger.", "I had a major loss when I was around your age. It hurts so much because we really aren\u2019t prepared to handle such a loss, so young. I\u2019m very sorry you have to go through this. \n\nSo there is no sugarcoating that all of this is going to suck, really hard, for a while. No one will be able to say or do anything that makes the pain better. But going through the motions alongside your supportive family is the best thing you can do to take care of yourself, and them. Family gets us through these hard times. Having things to do, even the most mundane things to do - keeps us from going mad with all of our big feelings of grief. Grief is a very heavy feeling to carry around, so try to share the load with your family and friends. \n\nI did the same thing back then, I kind of pretended that they were gone on vacation or something, because remaining in denial was just easier. It worked for about 3 years. BUT Stuffing our feelings of grief down to deal with later can turn into to big explosive feelings that seem uncontrollable - and tend to spill out at the very worst times. When my numbness wore off and the grief finally appeared it was bigger and even more unbearable - and since it was so many years later I mostly had to deal with all these big emotions on my own. \n\nAs sad as we are to lose them, there is something really beautifully in honoring our loved ones when they pass. Do try to go, to honor and celebrate the time you had together. For your own closure, and to support your family. It really will mean more to you later than it seems to now. Big hugs.", "Oh, honey, I'm so sorry this has happened to you. There is nothing good about losing your mom when you're fourteen years old. In fact, losing your mom may be the worse thing that could ever happen to you and your dad. Because of this, emotions are running high. Grief has this strange way of making people half crazy sometimes for a short period, often for longer. When it's fresh and new, no one is thinking straight. There is too much loss taking up all the space. The world has just ended for those who loved her and I get that you'd probably just rather crawl straight under the covers and stay there until it's all over. That's all normal. Right now, no one's thinking straight and everything is upside down. I'm guessing your dad is taking this very hard so it's equally very hard for him to support you in the way he ordinarily might. He's reactive for good reason. I've been in this situation and it's gut wrenching when everyone is falling apart around you and you're basically useless in that you're so overwhelmed, you can't help. So, here's the thing about funerals; they're not really for the dead, they're for the living. It's a way for people to come together, remember someone they loved or cared about and to show their respects to the family who are grieving. Family, friends, neighbours, anyone who may also be reeling by this terrible loss  want to have the opportunity to pay their respects and show they care. It's a show of respect and solidarity, love because there is nothing else they can do, apart from delivering the odd casserole or two. There's nothing else anyone can do but tell you they're sorry and tell you if there's anything you need, you're to call them. You won't likely, the grieving are immobilized, but they want you to know the offer is there. Most people don't know how to deal with death is also true. As your mom's daughter, it would be helpful if you could be in solidarity with dad and the rest of the family for this one occasion - if you are able. After that, your world will change as the days, and weeks, months and years go on. But sometime in the future, I promise you, you'll be glad you went to your mother's funeral. You've a hard road ahead, and I wish you and your dad nothing but love. I'm sure your mother would have wished for the same.", "You are definitely NTA.\nI am so sorry you have lost your mom. I can\u2019t imagine what you are feeling. Adults don\u2019t know what to do either. Because we can\u2019t make it better. And we do want to make it better for you! \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go. it won\u2019t bring her back (believe me, I know). And going will probably make you sad. But it\u2019s normal and actually healthy to be sad. To feel. To express how you feel. Because if we keep the feelings inside it makes us sick after a while. \n\nWhatever you do, try to let out how you feel: tell someone, write it down, scream, say it out loud\u2026.whatever you want. But feel.", "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you at this time in your life. You are definitely NTA. That said, I think you should go. Maybe just for an hour. Maybe just stay in a cry room at the funeral home or if there\u2019s a church service, stay in the back. It will matter to the future you. Maybe ask your dad if you can go but be hidden? If maybe he could meet you in the cry room every so often if he needs support. Maybe other relatives can help host. \n\nWhen my mom died, I was 28, and I understand the feeling that it wasn\u2019t real. It lasts for a little while I think because it\u2019s such a shock. I mean, she had a long illness, but I was still so surprised. I had a hard time at the gathering that followed at her house. I kept briefly hugging people, crying and then hiding upstairs because I just couldn\u2019t take it. Even so, it was good that I tried. \n\nNo one should tell you how to grieve, but I wouldn\u2019t want you to feel later like you missed this part of her life. Would she have wanted you to go? Is your dad maybe upset because he\u2019s grieving as well and can\u2019t process that he\u2019ll have to say goodbye to his wife alone, without you there? I hope you talk more to him about this. He loves you and knows you\u2019re hurting, and he\u2019s hurting too.", "NTA, I lost my mum last year. I am older than you, but the funeral felt like a chore, that it was for other people to grieve her. Not me.\n\nBut on the flip side of that, I made sure to start dealing with my grief and to allow myself to feel what I needed to feel", "Nah \n\nNo one is in the wrong here.  I think you should talk to someone professional about this because it\u2019s a complex thing at any age.  But if I can offer some things to consider - 1). you mom\u2019s situation isn\u2019t changed by you going or not and that will be something you eventually have to reconcile yourself with.  2) going to a funderal is about honoring her so maybe you don\u2019t do it for you but for her 3). You may regret not going and having the opportunity to have that final goodbye - you may not but I think you should give it consideration to it", "I\u2019m so sorry, may your memories be a blessing.   That being said, funerals are for the living.  They make some people feel good, some people like the sympathy (a lot of people do not).   You can remind your dad that you can talk to your mom whenever you want, and you can go to the cemetery when you are ready.  Everyone grieves and deals with death differently.  The pressure is because the \u201cnorm\u201d is to have a funeral and everyone goes to be sad and celebrate all at the same time.  take care of yourself, find someone to talk to and if you need to ask your dad or a trusted relative to find a doctor of you.", "Life is full of experiences, both positive and challenging, that shape us as individuals. It's important to recognize that avoiding certain experiences can limit personal growth and development. While it's understandable to have reservations or fears, facing and embracing life's experiences can lead to valuable lessons, personal resilience, and a broader perspective. By actively engaging with different situations, we expand our understanding of the world, develop new skills, and discover our own strengths and capabilities. It's through these experiences, both pleasant and difficult, that we gain wisdom, empathy, and a deeper appreciation for life. Embracing life's experiences, even the challenging ones, can ultimately lead to personal growth and a more fulfilling journey. You may read this and still gain no intuition due to your undeveloped brain.", "It\u2019s your choice, but it\u2019s a chance to be with other people and grieve for your mum together, say goodby together, you go to the wake and talk about her and her life. Weeks down the road you will still be grieving but others that didn\u2019t  love her as much as you will have moved on with their lives, and that can feel insulting that everyone else is managing just fine without her. Honestly it feels like honouring the person, them being important to everyone while they say goodbye. Being together with your family can bring you closer, seeing everyone being upset about her loss is somehow better then being isolated in your grief and feeling like no-one else cares. I would argue that it helps your mental health. And I do think that one day you may regret missing being part of the last event that was about your mum.", "I am so very sorry for your loss! I lost my mom unexpectedly when I was 26 and it was so hard. Please do not be afraid to reach out to others when the feelings get to be too much or to seek out counseling. \n\nIt will get easier in time. Remember your mom will always be with you in your heart and your memories.", "As many have pointed out, your Dad is right - it\u2019s highly likely you\u2019ll likely regret it if you don\u2019t go, and it doesn\u2019t make him a lame clich\u00e9 person for thinking that. It doesn\u2019t make you an AH if you don\u2019t go either- everyone grieves differently and denial is one of the first stages. But you will probably hurt those around you, and in the end you may hurt yourself. You can never go back in time and change this. Hearing people talk about how much they loved your Mom might be a way to connect and learn something new - most funerals I attend I learn something about them I didn\u2019t, and it makes me love them even more.\n\nI know that feeling of disbelief and avoidance - most of us do. We\u2019re never ready to realize someone is truly gone. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing such a horrible loss so young :( Just remember that your Dad is hurting too, and navigating something new. I\u2019ve experienced family tragedy too, and sometimes parents screw up and don\u2019t handle it how we want. It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love and want what\u2019s best for you. \ud83e\udd0d NAH", "NTA I'm so so sorry for your loss. My mother passed away when I was 14 also. Losing a parent in general is tough, but especially at that age. People grieve in different ways so you wouldn't be the AH if you didn't go. I completely understand your logic for not going, but at the end of the day you do need to understand that she is gone whether or not you go to the funeral. It's going to be hard to go, but I think you will regret not going down the road once you've had a chance to fully process everything. This is your opportunity to say your final goodbyes, which you may not think you need but you do. Try to remember that your father lost her too. The funeral will be hard on him, but I'm sure having you there with him during this trying time will lessen the pain. \n\nI was really reluctant to go to my mother's funeral, but for a different reason. My mom was really sick for years, so when she died I was relieved because she was suffering and death ended that for her. I was worried going to the funeral would replace that relief with grief, and I didn't want to grieve her because it felt selfish. In the end I did end up going, and I'm so glad I did. I got to hear stories about her I had never heard and see pictures of her I had never seen. In a sense I got to know my mom a little more at her funeral. If I hadn't gone I wouldn't have gotten that, and because I did I have more memories of her which I will forever cherish. I got to say my final goodbye to her, and I even wrote her a letter that I was able to put in her casket so that even in death, she has a part of me with her which gives me great comfort. I'm not saying you have to do any of this, I'm just sharing my experience. Funerals aren't for the dead really, they're for the living. And going to my mom's funeral, even though I didn't want to, helped my grieving process immensely.\n\nWhatever you decide, just remember she'll always be with you. As long as you live on, so does she. You are a part of her. Keep your chin up. The pain never goes away but I promise you, coping with the pain gets easier with time.

Regret is truly one of the most difficult things to cope with and you will most definitely regret not going when you're older. Some days you just have to get through, sorry bud.", "You're not an asshole. But you are in grief and grief is really strange. It affects us all differently, and it changes over time. I think you'd regret not going, and that this is the wrong set of justifications for a moment in time you can never get back. Believe me, noone wants to go to their mother's funeral. But you should go.", "You will regret not giving your mom a proper goodbye. Even if you do something away from the funeral, do something to mark your respect and the love that will be with you. \n\nI promise, it will hit you. It will feel like it hits you every minute of every day some days. 10,20,30 years later, it will hit you when and where you dont expect. \n\nWhen some time has passed, you will feel it as something beautiful. Love. Care. Smiles. Some wonderful reminder will come. Some lament that is still, somehow, poetry in your heart. \n\nIt will never be okay. You will grow around grief, but it will forever be there. But whether youre at the funeral or not, she is alive in your heart and spirit. \n\nHold onto that, and the fact you got 14 years of memories to take with you. They will be a comfort. Write down everything you remember - you won\u2019t forever. And it will be a cherished piece of you that can be visited. \n\nIm so sorry for your loss. Take the space and time you need.

It happened 20 years ago and I literally still cry and want my mum. But I know she\u2019s not here. The funeral was really sad. But also a celebration. I met people I didn\u2019t know and they told me awesome stories about her that I didn\u2019t know. But made my heart swell. \n\nI won\u2019t give a judgement because it\u2019s so unfair.

I'm sorry. \n\nAs many others have said, most far more eloquently than me, I think you should go. Delaying the reality won't help you in a long run, or even the short term to be honest. \nMy dad died after a short illness in 2015 and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that some of my fondest memories of him and that time were from his wake and funeral (Irish traditional funeral). \nThe love I saw being poured out for him, the widespread community grief, the stories and memories people shared, it gave me a whole new perspective on my dad. O knew he was awesome, I knew his life story, but I didn't know him as Joe, the secretary of the local hall committee, the pioneer, the workman, the music man etc etc. I heard some fascinating stories and all these things helped me process the grief, and take comfort in how much support we had, how loved he was and in turn how loved we were. \n\nObviously, we don't know the family circumstances or your mums personality, other siblibgs etc, but I had to comment and just share my perspective. The other thing is, and it's unfair as you're so young still, your dad most likely needs you with him, for support, comfort and to know that you are ok. It will be hard enough to attend such s funeral and be chief mourner but to be missing your son too, might be really tough. It's not your job to mind your dad, but there's a comfort in having your family with you at such a tough time. \nIf you are struggling with it still, perhaps ask a friend to sit with you for support, or maybe a cousin you're close to, just to have someone extra to support or distract you. \nUltimately of course this is your decision, and it's difficult, but try to explain or chat with your dad, just so he can see where you're coming from. \nIf it's a religious service, maybe being involved in deciding the prayers etc might help, or speaking to the officiant before to know what's to expect. \n\nFinally, my sincere sympathies on your loss, as someone else said, grief will come in whether you allow it or not, sometimes its easier to ride the waves as they come, rather than fighting it and ending up in deeper waters. Or something nautical like that. \nPlease consider grief counselling once the funeral is over, there's a lot to process and it's ok to need help.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.

I got to say good bye and grieve with my family, I shared funny stories about my poppa and heard some from his childhood. It was sad and I cried a lot but it helped me so much just being there with other people who loved him and seeing others feeling the same way I did made me realize it\u2019s okay to be sad.

Maybe not now but eventually and the funeral will not only give you a chance to say goodbye, but will also help you face the reality of your situation, which is more important than you know.  unfortunately, death is a part of life and you\u2019re only delaying the inevitable which could hurt you in the long run.

It doesn't mean you don't care and shame on them for saying that to you. Grief is not a linear process and you'll experience it how you go through it.

I was more worried about whether I had enough food for people than saying goodbye to my mom.\n\nBut it comes, like it comes for us all. The pain will come. The loneliness. The sensing of the empty places she left behind, the finality of never seeing her again, of having life divided between With Mom and now Without Mom.

When you start feeling it, it's like a bouncy ball in a very small box: every time it hits a wall, every time *you* get reminded, you feel that grief. Time passes... the box gets bigger, and the bouncy ball hits the walls less often, but it never really goes way and never really stops bouncing; only the box grows. It'll still hit you years from now at weird little moments.\n\nSo you might not feel it at the funeral, even if people expect you to. And that's okay. It's okay to say that, \"it hasn't hit me yet\", there's a *reason* we say that.\n\nBut you should go, anyway.

That being said, I was 13 when my dad died, so I can understand your thought process here. As an adult looking back, while it was a terrible thing that happened to me, and my brother, and my mom, going to the funeral was the right thing to do for me. I did not go to the wake/visitation.\n\nWe were a military family and lived far away from family when my dad got sick and died. We had to travel quite a distance to go to the funeral/where he wanted to be buried. We had lots of family and friends there to support us. Being a big Irish Catholic family we got to telling stories after the funeral and I heard things about my dad as a kid and other stories from his life that I never knew. I got to hear how much people loved him and what a good friend he was to others.\n\nThis is probably the hardest thing that you\u2019ve gone through so far in your life. Do you have an adult (not your dad) that you feel comfortable talking to? Maybe even a teacher or school counselor? What you\u2019re feeling is so common and totally understandable. I\u2019m just worried you will regret not attending her service as you get older. If there is going to be some kind of religious ceremony, would you consider perhaps sitting in the back with a family member?\n\nNo matter what you decide to do, please ask your dad or other adult for grief counseling. That wasn\u2019t a thing when I was growing up when my dad died. We were just supposed to get on with our lives. it\u2019s hard to think about the future when you\u2019re grieving for your mom now.\n\nI\u2019d also ask you to give yourself, and your dad, some grace as you both come to terms with this devastating loss. He\u2019s going through a loss as well, and I am sure he\u2019s worried about you. No one ever knows how to handle something like this\u2026as you\u2019ll learn when you\u2019re an adult, we all are just faking it and doing the best we can to get to the next day. He\u2019s probably feeling as lost as you are. Our society is weird when it comes to death. Some people cry and scream and are super emotional. Other withdraw into themselves -that\u2019s kind of what I did - others seem unemotional and then it hits them days, weeks, years later. There is no one right way to grieve when someone has died.\n\nI wish I could give you a hug and and magically make everything better. What I can tell you is that you\u2019ll always miss your mom and that is totally OK. You\u2019ll never forget her and you\u2019ll eventually be able to talk about her and share stories about her. Trust me on this. I\u2019m old\u2026my dad died over 40 years ago. There isn\u2019t a day that I don\u2019t think about him, but I remember the silly things, and fun things, and just the ordinary everyday things we\u2019d do. That\u2019s how I keep him alive in my heart. There are times I still get a little teary thinking about him and other times I can tell a story and laugh about the situation. I would tell my kids stories about my dad (their grandfather) and now I tell my grandson those stories.\n\nMay her memory be a blessing to you and everyone who knew her.", "Hi OP, NTA.\n\nI lost my mum a while ago, not as young as yourself.\n\nThere's perfectly valid reasons for not going to a funeral. I personally find looking at deceased humans incredibly uncomfortable, and will never do it without damn good reason again.

Even if you just watch Netflix. Don\u2019t stay back alone, and feel lonely. Funerals are for the living, not the deceased. You will find your own way to deal. I lost a close friend a few years ago. I have a metal dove with her name on it hanging in my car. That means a lot to me. I still have her last text messages - from 3 years ago. Maybe you want to hold on to your moms  jewelry or her favorite blanket. Whatever you need, it\u2019s ok. You will grieve in your own time. Hugs honey.", "NTA.

I looked around the room and realized how many lives he had touched.

This is such a difficult thing to go through, and I don\u2019t blame you one bit for being at the bargaining stage of grief. I\u2019m sure it hardly feels real, so it makes sense you\u2019re doing relatively fine. \n\nI understand that you want to be strong for your dad, but you need to allow yourself to feel too. It\u2019s okay to be sad, this is a sad thing. It does not make you weak or broken to take some time and cry. It\u2019s okay if it takes you some time to get to that point.

Sending love and light\u2665\ufe0f", "NTA, but I'm going to tell you the exact opposite of what everyone here is telling you.  \n\nIf you don't want to go, don't.  First, you've already said goodbye and intrinsically you know she's gone. Thinking that not going to her funeral doesn't mean she's gone is a nice thought, but you already know that isn't true. Denial is the first and sometimes strongest stage of grief, but you're already pushing through that based on your admission.\n\nSecond, Going to see her in a casket isn't going to change her being gone and you're not really even saying goodbye to her. She's not there, she can't hear you, and you may find there are better ways to say goodbye.\n\nThird, some funerals aren't what you expect. They can be overly religious, incredibly traumatizing (some people react extremely negatively, i.e. fainting, falling on the casket, screaming and wailing, etc.) \n\nFourth, ask yourself what you want the last memory of your mom to be. I've been to many a funeral and no matter how good of a job morticians do, it's still not the person you remember. Unless it's a closed casket or memorial without display, it could be difficult to see your mom that way. \n\nYour dad is likely someone who needs the comfort and support of others to help him through his grief. And there's nothing wrong with that. But he should also be respectful of your choice. And yes, you may regret it when you're older, but you also may regret going.\n\nMake the decision that's best for you. My gram's funeral turned into a circus. My grandfather, who was in a car accident, didn't even look like himself. The mortician gave my aunt a uniboob. I've been to so many funerals because of \"familial obligation\" that I didn't want to go to starting at the age of 8.

Making me go to her funeral when I clearly don\u2019t want to \u2014 I\u2019m asking you nicely to not force me to go. I want to hold on to memories of Mom, not a coffin.

If you haven't seen this before, grief has five well-recognized stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. They tend to go in that order, but not everybody goes through every stage and sometimes they swap around and sometimes they go in cycles.\n\nEverything in your post says that you are in the \"denial\" stage. And I can totally understand wanting to hang on to that because it's less painful than some of the others, but realistically, you're not going to be able to. The only way out of grief is through, and you're going to have to let yourself feel all the things you're going to feel if you want to get to the other side. People's efforts to short-circuit it with avoidance, withdrawal, and self-medicating with substances just lead them to an unhealthy place mentally and physically. The healthy way to deal with it is to let yourself feel everything and have a trusted person (relative, friend, counselor) who you can talk to freely about it.\n\nI agree with your dad that you're ultimately going to regret it if you don't go to the funeral. It may not feel like what you need now in your current stage of the process, but you will need it (or the memory of it) when you reach some of the other stages, and unfortunately you can't go back for a redo.

A dream about her, a book, a song, anything.. it's just a matter of time, so go where you have some support. You may stay closed down threw the funeral, but at least you'll have said goodbye and shared the grief of others who loved her.

It\u2019s a form of closure, and it actually did help seeing other people who loved my mum come together and share our memories of her. You are right in that it won\u2019t bring her back. But you will learn more about her at the funeral, as a person rather than as your mother. Those memories will help you with the grief, eventually. Not now, not in a month, but when acceptance finally comes through. Also, never listen to anyone who tell you later on that you need to move on.

It is so so normal for funerals to be scary and uncomfortable and wanting to avoid them at all possible, you\u2019re not weird or broken for feeling that way. What I will say is as scary as it is, I really think it\u2019s going to help the grieving process work along much smoother. Like you said, if you don\u2019t go it\u2019s like she can still come back? That\u2019s going to make moving towards the acceptance stage of grief harder and more laborious for you, whether you regret going or not. It\u2019s also important to know that accepting that she\u2019s gone, knowing and being okay with that, does not make you a bad son. As a mother she wants you to be healthy and happy and it\u2019s hard to do that while actively grieving. I promise you, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to mourn, your whole life in fact. It never goes away. But it becomes manageable, in a way where instead of looking back on her life and feeling visceral uncontrollable sadness you can feel happy for the time you had with her alongside the little ache that will always remain. I highly highly suggest going to the funeral and starting grief counseling. I promise now matter how weird or contradictory your feelings might seem they are normal. People mourn in so many different ways, and there are ways to start making life easier bit by bit.\nJust remember, you grieve on your own timeline.

I didn't get the closure i needed, but it helped me finally feel like i was almost ready to try. \n\nAt the end of the day, you will never regret going, but you may someday regret not going.", "Nta, please do what you want. When my grandfather died, we were at the hospital. When they told us we could go in and see him, I refused, I was only 12. My aunt, related by marriage, insisted I go in and see him. I had been crying, but in that moment I was finally calm and clear-minded. I said no again, and my mom tried to back me by saying it was my choice after all. But my mom had just lost her dad, so she couldn't appreciate the fight my aunt was putting up. Eventually I went because no one could advocate for me, they were all too grief-stricken. I wish I hadn't, I didn't need to see him like that. I have my memories with him and I didn't need this one.\n\nTake care, sending good thoughts.", "Nah", "I am so sorry for your loss.   I am sending you lots of light and love.  Stay strong...", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nNo one can force you to go. You\u2019re definitely NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve been to a few funerals in my time. While they\u2019re always sad events, tears shed, emotions are high - that\u2019s all true, I do, however, always find that there are some moments that I cherish. \n\nMost often it\u2019s the eulogy - when the persons life is shared, often with anecdotes/stories/funny moments that you may have never known. Your perspective is that she is your Mother. Other people have known her as a friend, sister, daughter, work colleague, lover/husband - so their perspectives will be different. \n\nYou may well be pleasantly surprised to learn something that you will now cherish and appreciate. \n\nI recommend you at least try to go. You can always leave if you really cannot cope. \n\nEveryone is there to support you and each other - there will be familiar faces there that you can rely on. \n\nHugs", "You are not the Asshole but neither are the people who want you to go. \n\nI suggest you read up on the stages of Greif. You are in denial and I do not say that as a accusation. A funeral and viewing can help you move past this stage .", "NTA. This is your personal decision that only you can make. After going to a few friends\u2019 funerals as a teenager I decided I didn\u2019t want to go through that anymore. Everyone grieves in their own way. Do what is right for you but make sure you really think about it before you make your final decision. Not attending doesn\u2019t mean you care any less. She\u2019s not there, it\u2019s just her shell. Do what is best for you not for other people or not because it\u2019s traditional to attend funerals. My mom also decided not to attend funerals anymore because it\u2019s too much to handle while already dealing with so much.", "NTA\n\nAnd I\u2019m sooo sorry for your loss. \n\nMy sister passed a couple of months ago. She didn\u2019t want a funeral, but a celebration of her life. So we had a big open bar and everyone told stories of how she impacted their lives or fun adventures they had with her. It was both sad and beautiful to know how she touched so many lives that I\u2019d never known.\n\nAt 14, you see a very different side of her life - going to the funeral may help you see who she was to other people. You may also connect with a couple other people who also loved her and they may be a wonderful shoulder to cry on - or just reminisce - when and if you need to.\n\nAs a side note, while I\u2019m old now, both my parents died when I was 13 and 14. We went to live with my uncle and aunt. As an adult, I feel we never properly processed that grief and it still affects me and my sisters. In retrospect, I so wish we had sought grief counseling at the time but that\u2019s not something for my family. \n\nEven though you may not feel the pain and sadness now, a grief counselor may be able to give you some tools to help process your grief when it comes or at least just have someone to talk to. Maybe go with your dad. I sure wish that had been an option for us as young kids.\n\nAgain, sooo sorry for your loss - such an incredibly difficult time. I would recommend attending the funeral, but - in the end - that\u2019s always your call.", "NTA.\n\nThe country I'm in, a lot of parents try to keep kids away from funerals from fear they'll be upset. Often, the kid decides they'd like to go, and more than once in my life I've been in the position of trying to persuade the parent to let them.\nSo that's where I'm coming from.\n\nI'm not going to tell you what to do - you're old enough to make your own decision as far as I'm concerned.\n\nHowever.. funerals, which almost every society for thousands of years has had in one form or another, are there for a reason - and it's not to make people feel bad. It's a way of showing togetherness, showing that despite the loss, a community or family is pulling together and carrying on. And yeah it can be a celebration of the life of the deceased, and a show of support for those closest to them, and an opportunity to grieve in a supportive environment.\n\nI'll always attend the funeral of a family member - I lost my dad earlier this year by the way, but you do you. I wouldn't think badly of you for not going and nor should anyone else.", "Yeah your an asshole. And your Dad is correct.", "If you think you might regret it later, just go. If you don\u2019t, fuckin stay home! I didn\u2019t go to my cousins funeral like 5 years ago and I honestly don\u2019t feel any way about it even though my family cant seem to shut up about it", "I think you should go. This is a terrible thing you are going through. Let your family support you. Have your dad talk to you about how the wake and the funeral will go see you\u2019ll have an idea. You\u2019ll get to hear some stories about your mom you never knew.", "NTA. You\u2019re grieving. Nothing we do in grief makes us an asshole. \n\nI will say this tho: we tend to regret the things we don\u2019t do much more than the things we did.", "I hope regardless of the outcome, you find peace in the coming days as you transition into a life without her physical presence around you.\n\nYou and your family will be in my thoughts.\n\nYou of course are NTA", "First of all, I am incredibly sorry for your profound loss. I am not a counselor but I do provide crisis and grief care to folks in my community and have worked in the mental health field for a long time. \n\nHoney, you have to choose what is best for yourself, and when I say that, you need to consider what is best for yourself in the long-term. Dealing with the death of your mom is likely the worst thing you've ever experienced and it's totally natural to feel like you are right now. \n\nAs others have said, if you don't try to go, you will regret it. And by regret, be prepared to feel the guilt along with the grief. I know it must feel like you can't face it, and it seems incredibly unfair to have to do it, but I do think it's a good idea to try to go, even for a brief time. \n\nMy brother passed away three years ago, and I had to get his six children to tell them what happened (ages 3 to 17 at the time). They came to stay with me for a few months after. There were lots of tears and screaming and numbness from all of them at different times. My nephew, who was 14 at the time,  wanted to go to school the morning after his dad passed. I didn't think it was a good idea, but he said he needed to feel normal. So I took him to school. A couple of hours later he called and needed to come home. I'm saying this because in the moment, he didn't want to deal with his dad's death, but pretending everything was normal wasn't working either. \n\nAlll 6 of the kids went to the funeral. They were there with their mom, and also for themselves. It is so important for you to say goodbye. If not, your brain may not accept that she is really gone, making the grief even harder. \n\nBe gentle on yourself. If you're not up to doing the whole thing, that's okay. But try your best to be there. Allow others to share the grief with you, especially your dad and your family. \n\nAnd there are absolutely no ah's here.", "I'll tell you to do whatever you feel is right for you. Grieving is such a personal thing. If you'd rather remember your mom how she was before then go with it. At my sister's funeral everyone told me I had to look at her in the casket but I did not want to. I don't regret this decision. She lives in my mind by how I remember her alive. Everyone mourns differently and if this is what you need to protect yourself for now then it's okay. It's your grieving.", "NTA. My mother recently died. I\u2019m much, much older than you, but I understand your feelings. Your dad has a point about regretting it later. However, this is your choice.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I am so sorry for you in losing your beloved mother. Grief can be overwhelming, I know, as I've lost my Mom, too. But please go, to honor your mother and your relationship. Maybe even plan to say a few words. Be comforted by your relatives and others. And speak of her always with words of love and laughter, not of sorrow and tears. God bless.", "You are not an asshole.  You've lost your Mama and that's brutal at any age but especially at 14.  I'm not going to tell you that you should go to the funeral but your Dad may be right and you might regret not saying goodbye to her.  When my Mom died, I can remember how hard it was to wrap my mind around her being gone.  I couldn't imagine a World that she didn't exist in.  For a couple of weeks, I just didn't acknowledge her absence.  But, eventually, the realization did set in and it was painful.  \n\nI have a son your age and when I think about passing, the only painful part about it is thinking about my kids missing me and hurting.  I'm sure your Mama felt the same way.\n\nRegardless of what decision you make, I hope you're going to be okay.", "You are NTA for not wanting to go, I completely understand. But maybe this one time you trust that your father has your best interest in mind because you WILL likely regret it and you will not get a second chance for that final time at her side above ground. Pretending she might come back is a temporary bandaid that will eventually fall away and you will still have to grieve fully... but without the chance to be there at the funeral I feel like it would be harder to move on.", "NAH\n\nHey kid. I'm a grown person and it totally sucked losing my mom when I was an adult. I didn't want it to be real either, so I get it. \n\nThing is, the funeral is meant to be for you and all the people mom left behind. It's to help you say goodbye and start working on your grief. \n\nI'm sorry about your mom. I get it and it sucks.", "Nta. My mom died when I was in fourth grade. It was sudden and devastating, and I didn\u2019t want to believe it either. I didn\u2019t want to go to the funeral, or see that finality. But I was little, and didn\u2019t get to make that choice, and I\u2019m kind of glad it wasn\u2019t up to me. Looking back, I would definitely have regretted not going. My family, my friends, everyone who loved me and my mom all came together there to support me and express their love for my mom. If I hadn\u2019t gone, I never would have gotten to feel that overwhelming support that is ultimately what got me through things at the end of the day. You don\u2019t have to go; you\u2019re old enough to make that decision and no one should be shaming you for it. But as someone else who lost their mom when young, I can tell you it really helps if you do. Funerals are to celebrate the dead, sure. But they\u2019re more to support us, the living. Let your friends and family support you, and you won\u2019t regret it.", "NTA but I agree with what a lot of others are saying in the comments. Generally people don't go to funerals cause they don't like the person, not because they don't want to accept the death of a loved one. I won't say whether you should or should not go but I'll say you may regret not going at some point down the road.", "Go and give and receive support.  Whether or not you go, she is not coming back.  She lives on through you", "Nta first I'm sorry for your loss.  and That's a normal feeling.  But I think youur family is right that you should go. You will never have the chance again.  Everyone grieves how they feel they need to.  Do what's best for you but what you think is best right now you may regret in the future too.", "NTA\nOh my dear. I'm so deeply sorry. Of course you aren't an ah for not wanting to go. It is so hard to think or be rational when you've faced a loss like this. I'm sure your dad is hurting right now too, and since he sees things differently, he can't see past his needs for you to be there. Could you try to shift perspective and see it as a mutual support situation? Funerals, at their best,  are for everyone to grieve together and to also do your best to celebrate your mom, remember her, let that memory be a presence in the space. Whatever you decide, just try to do your best, and know that you deserve to grieve your own way in your own time.", "First, Im sorry for your loss I understand it is a hard thing to deal with.\n\nSecond, how hard can be, well\u2026. when my grandfather died, I literally ended up graving shovel and dig the grave for later low the coffin inside of it and then proceed to cover it.\n\nIm pretty sure your experience is gonna be way less hectic than this, so I recommend you to go.\n\nIn my experience its been always quite healthy to be there when it gets over and always give me closure, even in this particular ocassion.\n\nNTA.", "I'm just so sorry.  \n\nI lost a very, very close family friend a few years ago, and there was a memorial service for her.  I got to meet many people who loved her, people I'd heard her speak of all my life, and got learn more about her and hear some wonderful stories.  \n\nJust something to keep in mind.  Also, being there to support her other loved ones may feel helpful to you too.", "You really should go. I know its the hardest thing you are ever gonna do, but believe me you will reflect it. Maybe not now but someday. I lost my mom too and it is very healing to say your final goodbye. Please if not for you but for your family. You all need to lean on each other right now", "No, you\u2019re totally right! Funerals just make it worse in my opinion and I totally get why you don\u2019t want to go, and how you think it will make you sadder. But I also kind of understand where your dad is i ming from, like it\u2019s probably a respect thing in his opinion. But I think he should respect that\u2019s what you think is right and you should just do what you want.", "NTA, we all grieve differently. However, something this significant could be something you regret later on in your life.", "NTA My mom has been gone for 4 1/2 years. My experience has been that funerals are important bc they help with processing of the situation, to see people come together who loved and cared about her, and who also care about you as her family. They are gathering to show their support. It helps to attend to come to terms with the permanence of the situation. Your mom isn\u2019t coming back. I agree that if I hadn\u2019t attended my mom\u2019s funeral, it would be somewhat easy to wonder if her death had actually happened. Like she just went on a trip and hadn\u2019t returned yet. Though I was there and I saw. It still sometimes seems surreal that my mom is gone. If you\u2019re concerned about showing emotions, it\u2019s normal and okay. If you\u2019re not feeling much emotion, the reality may not have set in yet, or you may have no idea that you\u2019re in a state of shock. I encourage you to go through the motions and not deprive yourself the experience of attending her funeral bc there\u2019s no going back. You very well may regret it later, although there\u2019s no way of knowing that now. If you don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t. You\u2019re so young, though, that I wouldn\u2019t want for you to make a mistake that you wish you could take back later. I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP my condolences. Death isn\u2019t easy and grief isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s sound like you think you\u2019ll skip the grief by skipping the funeral, that\u2019s not how it works. My friend missed her moms funeral for this reason\u2026she committed suicide 3 years later over the guilt and everything else going on in her life. My best recommendation is speaking to a therapist and deciding your best course of action from there. If you do decide to skip I hope that\u2019s what\u2019s best for you. Good luck and godspeed. NAH.", "I already posted a response but I wanted to tell you something else really important.  Your Mama is going to be part of your life forever.  No matter how many years pass, she is going to be there.  I don't mean like a ghost but rather, she exists in your heart and you'll find that the things you had with her stay with you.  If you have kids, you'll see her in their faces.  You'll make decisions in life and in the back of your mind, you'll \"hear\" what your Mom would have told you.  She will be an ever present part of your life and that's a gift we get to keep because of the love we shared and I can tell you, without a doubt, the greatest love your Mama had was for her children.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\n\nNothing can prepare you for losing a parent. And funerals are not fun. They DO give you the opportunity to feel what you feel (or don\u2019t yet feel) and start to get closure. It\u2019s real, whether it feels like it now or not. \n\n\nMy dad passed away unexpectedly several years ago; I was in my 30s. At the funeral, there were people I\u2019d never met who were his friends from before I was born. Some of my moms friends came who she hadn\u2019t seen in awhile-they get together regularly now. I saw my own friends who\u2019d driven hours to support me-I had no idea they were coming. People were just sharing their memories and stories. And some were just there to sit quietly and do what was important to them. \n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be social. You don\u2019t have to go at all.

You are also facing growing up without one of your major supports. Starting that with running away is not going to lead you to become strong and independent.  What your mom wanted for you more than anything else is to thrive, to grow, not to let anything keep you from being the best you you can be. \nI won't lie.

There is no one correct way to grieve. I suggest still going. It's like facing your greatest fear and in that moment, you will have no choice but to accept and overcome it by whatever means you can. Let your family support you in that moment and help you deal with the emotions.

Hopefully someone will invite people to tell stories about her and you can have a smile just for a minute on a crap day \u2026 she raised you so far to be polite and kind and attentive to others and be able to stand up for yourself and express your thoughts - pretty cool mom - so I am guessing you will get a story or two.

This is your mother we are talking about, and you are losing her at a very young age, so you will inevitably have a breakdown or even several at some point. Let them happen, don\u2019t hide them from whoever you are around, ride your waves of sadness and mourning out and let those feelings out into the open. Don\u2019t suppress your sadness because for some reason you feel you have to. You don\u2019t have to hide it. If anyone asks just tell them you miss her so much, and they will understand.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. The only reason to do so imo would be for appearances or to support your family members who want you to be there.\n\nCelebrating her life can and should be done on your own terms.\n\nIf you were close, the grief process is gradual - it\u2019s how your mind protects itself - and there isn\u2019t an end point, your life is just different from now on. \n\nIt completely sucks and it\u2019s not fair and everything you are feeling is normal and okay.", "NTA and as others have said, nobody is an asshole in this situation. I am sad for you though that your Dad and others are getting mad at you for not wishing to attend. \n\nI am so sorry you have to go through this. No matter how long we live none of us are ready to lose a mother, especially not at 14. It is very unfair. The finality of death is a hard thing to wrap your head around if you haven\u2019t lost someone close to you before. It is going to take a while for it to really hit you. Right now you are numb and in shock. It\u2019s perfectly normal. \n\nMy advice to you is to go to the funeral. It is going to be hard. She was too young to go. Funerals are part of the grieving process for the living. They exist for a reason. It\u2019s your chance to hear stories about her that you\u2019ve never heard and may never hear if you are not there. You may even have a laugh. It\u2019s also a chance to support your father. His grief is different than yours but worrying about you being home alone while buring a spouse would make it all the more difficult. Mostly it gives a chance for everyone to say  goodbye to your mom. \n\nWe did not have a funeral for either of my parents. Neither wanted one. It did leave me feeling like I was in a bit of limbo, if that makes sense. Of course I\u2019m way, way, way older than you. But there was no real closure. I mean there was in the end but without the gathering of everyone who loved each of them, it felt incomplete. They were both adamant about it.\n\nAlso, as someone said before, have a support person with you and plan ahead for a place for you to go if it all gets to be too much. If you can, try to have a few private moments with her beforehand. \n\nIf I could give you a big hug, I would.

I wish not going would have meant he might come back. But sadly that is not how things work.  Of course going will make you sad and that is okay. And if you don\u2019t cry that is okay too.  About a year after my dad died I went to a support group for people who had lost a parent.  I cried there for the first time in a long time. I also cried when a dad character on a tv show died.

Plan the funeral, pick out the things, pick out the music, reminisce, support each other, cry, drive to the burial, listen to the speeches, then there's the burial. And then once all of that is done, you are still sad. You still miss them. The world still makes less sense than it did last week.

I remember everything turning blue, then dark then swirly blue.  People said things.  People got up.  People my mom used to be friends with that I know for a fact she hadn\u2019t seen in almost 10 years kept saying how sorry they were.   \n\nIt didn\u2019t make it easy at all, and even today I still have dreams of my mom - she\u2019s asleep in another room and I can\u2019t find her; she\u2019s been at work for weeks and I have no idea what her phone number is, or why she\u2019s not coming home; I go home after being gone for a long time to find her car there, but the house appears empty.

I didn\u2019t go to the cemetery to see my mom for at least 10 years, and only because someone else died\u2026 for the same reason. my family was entirely unsupportive when my mother died which may or may not be the case for you. I didn\u2019t want to go, but here\u2019s the thing. if your friend\u2019s parent died, you would go to the funeral if your friend wanted the support whether or not you knew their parent. there\u2019s a similar angle of\u2026 if your family is upset, they want you to be there for them. they want to be there for you. they want to do what no one wants to do together. \n\nin my case.. my family would throw the \u201cyou\u2019ll regret it one day\u201d stuff at me too, which for them was entirely abusive and terrible to say to someone so young (or of any age really) going through something this traumatic. they had no intentions otherwise, I could go on much longer there but it\u2019s a fact. your family might just be grieving and saying things out of turn like this that they don\u2019t realize or intend to be hurtful, but you are perfectly valid in being upset by this even if they can\u2019t see why for now. \n\nstill, in my experience. even though it\u2019s one of the worst days of my life, even though I had zero support from my family, I do not regret going to her funeral. I didn\u2019t want to go, I really had to force myself. I didn\u2019t want to see and experience something I already knew, I just didn\u2019t want it to be real or want the reminder. ultimately\u2026 I did it because my relationship with my mom was different than anyone else. I wanted to be the one person there \u201ccelebrating her life\u201d who actually loved and cared about her. the way she did for me. I just wanted to be in the same room one more time. \n\nwhatever you decide, it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks. it\u2019s your life, it\u2019s your decision. it\u2019s not their place to project this regret onto you, whether they mean to or not. you and only you know your relationship with your mom. whether you go or not, nothing will change this or the love that\u2019s there.\n\nmy last perspective here just for the sake of in case my personal hindsight is helpful at all\u2026 is that it took me almost 20 years to realize how much I had repressed this unresolved grief. I didn\u2019t want to be reminded, ever. your brain is trying to protect you from the trauma, it\u2019s doing what it\u2019s supposed to do. it will do whatever it can to hide the feelings that are too hard to process. once your brain does this, it\u2019s going to subconsciously affect how you handle basically anything until you do the thing no one wants to do and fully process this grief. I could go on much longer there too, but it really did take me this incredibly long to really understand this. but what I hope is different for you than it was for me, is that my family was very psychologically and emotionally abusive. I have chronic ptsd, all that jazz. if I had the right kind of support from my family at the time, or ever.. it would have been so different. \n\nI am so incredibly sorry for all of this, and please know that however you grieve is how you need to grieve. do whatever you need to do, trust your intuition. communicate honestly with your family and I hope they have the capacity to really listen to you, understand, and support you however you need. if not, please PM me and I will.", "NTA- I\u2019m truly sorry for your loss.", "NTA.

I think you should go to the funeral, even if you don't think you want to now.  \n\n\n(34M) My father died when I was 17. When I found out, my day went from one of the happiest days of my life to one of the saddest days of my life. I spent the entire day on a field trip to an amusement park with my entire class under the loose guise of studying \"physics\" during the one of the last months of Junior year (11th grade) to coming home and finding out my father died. Thinking back now, after a 3 week hiatus from school, I don't think any of my teachers ever made me turn in the 50 pages of \"homework\" we were supposed to gather data for at the amusement park. Nevermind, that's just the side musings of an old fuddyduddy.  \n\n\nLike being in a traumatic accident, your body goes into shock. Not necessarily a physical shock, but a mental one. Just like physical shock, you're reeling from it. Numbness, confusion, disassociation. You're breaking into the first of five stages of grieving. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.  \n\n\nThe reason you're not an asshole is because of this. You're shocked, confused, can't believe she's actually gone. You don't attend because you want to believe it's all a sick joke and she'll pop back into existence and you can laugh and hug and love her again out of denial. That is where you are whether you accept it or not. I'm not going to say that attending her funeral will be easy. I'm not saying attending her funeral will be cathartic. Now. But future you will regret it if you don't. Now I don't want to guilt you into going, but I want to let you know, as a geezer in his mid 30's who also lost a parental figure in his teens, that's my perspective and I hope it adds some guidance.", "It\u2019s your decision. I don\u2019t think that YTA. If you can\u2019t handle it mentally then don\u2019t go. If you\u2019re close with your dad/ family members then simply explain your reasoning. I\u2019m not sure what your relationship with your mother is, but it\u2019s ultimately your decision. In a lot of cultures, a funeral is part of saying your final goodbyes and giving the dead a respectable final burial. However, don\u2019t think your mom may come back to life if you don\u2019t go to the funeral. That part is absolutely not true, and you know it.", "NTA. Sweetheart, you're in shock. You're numb. Some people don't feel the loss immediately, and that's perfectly normal. Some people even find a sort of comfort in it. It makes sense you'd want to avoid the funeral. Funerals make it real. That's why we have them, though. Because when we lose someone we love, we often NEED to understand that loss is real. \n\nMy brother's best friend died a few years ago. It was a tragic accident. The funeral was in a different state, where most of his family lives, and we couldn't attend because of it. His mom had a celebration of life up in our state. I was a fully grown woman, who had already experienced people around me dying, and my reactions ranged from devastated to relieved, depending on the person. Sweetheart, I KNEW he was gone, and for WEEKS, I could SWEAR that every so often in a crowd, I'd see him, this kid I loved as my own brother, out of the corner of my eye. And I'd whip my head around, feeling that hope bubble up. He was back! It was a bad dream! I'd run up and hug him and call my brother that he was alive! But of course he wasn't. It couldn't ever be him. My poor friend had been killed and his body mangled in such a tragic accident that they had to have a closed casket funeral. But for WEEKS, I'd be seeing him. I checked our Facebook messages and texts so many times, just hoping beyond reason that I'd see that he was typing a message to me. Finally, I thought I'd seen him again and I went to my car and cried so hard I couldn't breathe. I actually had to break out my inhaler, which I hadn't needed for at least a year at that point. It didn't stop until we had his celebration of life, where his mom had his ashes on a table, and we all could finally say goodbye to the best person we'd all ever known. I stopped seeing him after that. It made it real, and final, and I could progress in my grieving process. \n\nGrieving WILL happen. Your mind will force it eventually. My brother also went numb. He didn't cry. Everything just shut off. He was too busy taking care of everyone else. This was his BEST friend of over a decade. His partner in crime. They were inseparable. He was too busy making sure his friend's mother ate something, helping her plan the funeral and celebration of life, helping her go through his things, letting his online friends know he was gone... Then I got home from work one night. Took my pants and bra off. Usually that means I'm in for GOOD. But my phone went off and it was him. It had hit him, just like I'd bet money it'll eventually hit you. He was sobbing. He couldn't even talk. He just choked out my name. I yanked my pants and bra back on, ran to my husband, said \"I gotta go. *brother's name*-\" and he told me to go. I drove like a mad woman to get to him. And yes, he was totally broken down by the time I got to him. The grief hit him all at once. He didn't know what to do EXCEPT call me. He shut down himself for a couple days after, totally swallowed by the grief. He didn't even want to get out of bed. I'm not saying this to scare you. I want you to be prepared. There is NO wrong way to grieve, but for both of us, the celebration of life brought us peace. It put a finality to it, a finality we wouldn't have had otherwise. It was so horrible, those few weeks, thinking my buddy was coming back, knowing I was deluding myself. \n\nI really want to urge you to go. You're still NTA if you don't, but regardless of if you do or don't, please open up to your family, especially your dad. Tell them why you don't want to go. You can talk to a school counselor, or a friend's parent and have them help you explain, if you need that assistance. If you're religious, I'm sure your pastor or another trusted person at your house of worship could help you process your thoughts AND help you talk to your dad about it. If all else fails, even showing him this post could open up that conversation. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, sweetie. I know your mom didn't want to leave you. Not wanting to go does not mean you didn't love her, and it's normal to want to avoid that pain, but it WILL hit eventually, and I think having that final goodbye will help you process it all.", "NTA. You do what YOU want. Grieving is personal. Remember the way you want to. Funerals are for everyone else not the person that had passed. \ud83d\udc9b", "You're not an AH for this, just know you are only delaying the realization that she's gone. It will be devastating when it does hit you, and being surrounded by family when that moment arises is the whole point really, of a funeral. Obviously no one can make you go. But not going because that makes it seem not real, doesn't make it not real. You will deal with the loss one day. Or maybe you're feeling the need to keep it together for dad, and you should know that's not your job either hun. \nBe gentle with yourself right now. And dad too.", "Sweetheart, my mum died when I was 12. I understand how this feels. You\u2019re currently in the \u201cdenial\u201d stage of grieving.\n\nYou need to go to your mums funeral. Not for your dad or any other family member but for your mum. You love her, she loved you. Funerals aren\u2019t fun events but it\u2019s how we celebrate someone\u2019s life and memory. And you\u2019re right, it will mean she is gone and not coming back but avoiding the funeral won\u2019t make that any less true. I promise you will regret not going one day in the future and when that day comes, there\u2019s no going back. \n\nYou need to go to the funeral. You need to try your best to maintain a good relationship with your dad because you\u2019re both going to have a lot of big feelings in the coming weeks and months. You need to (eventually) see a therapist, if only for a few sessions, to keep your mental health in check and process your feelings. \n\nYou are 100% NTA, just a young kid going through one of the worst things you can go through and not knowing how to process it all. You\u2019ll get through this.", "NTA. Your mental health comes first and while you can compartmentalize now, not everyone can. You should realize that going to the funeral might not be beneficial for you right now, but you being there might help other people. So you have a very grown up decision to make where you weigh your own feelings against your desire (some say obligation) to support the other members of your family.", "NTA yet, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever regret going, but you might regret not going", "NTA. So sorry for your loss. Deal with your loss in the way the way you need to, but attending the funeral could help. I am 60 and lost my mom 14 years ago. She was 64. I miss her every day, but you endure.", "NTA \n\nas a person who\u2019s seen a lot of passing in my family, whenever i attend a funeral i see my family members get into serious mental health issues after it. it\u2019s been over an year since my aunt died, she was just 32. her mother had visited us yesterday still grieving\u2026\n\ni wouldn\u2019t want you to go through the same if you know you won\u2019t handle it as you want it to. honestly i understand where your father and other family members are coming from but they need to acknowledge that not everyone will be as reluctant to attend a funeral they don\u2019t want to be it for any reasons. i\u2019m really sorry for your loss and i hope you feel better soon <3", "Bottom line: we all grieve differently. I'm sure you feel a need to please your family and are getting a lot of pressure to attend. I say take care of you, do what's best for your life, and hope that people are understanding...and if they aren't, perhaps you need to surround yourself with people who are supportive.", "I hate funerals. But I would go to my mom\u2019s. No it won\u2019t bring her back, but it is a very cathartic experience. I think you would regret not going more than regret going. I\u2019ve been there, but only you can understand how you feel. I\u2019m sorry!", "NTA, but not going to the funeral won't bring your mom back; it will only delay your grief. My husband did this (refused to accept his mother's death and grieve for her and his loss) and refused to go to her funeral so it couldn't \"be true.\" His mom has been gone six years, and he almost destroyed his life, repressing the pain of losing his mom. I know it's the most difficult thing you've probably ever done in your young life, but there can be some benefit to going to her funeral. You don't have to look at her if you don't want, you don't have to walk by her casket. Being with others who loved your mom can be very comforting, and you'll probably hear *wonderful stories* of your mom you've never heard before. \n\nI know I'm **not your mom** but I am *a mom* and I'm so *very, very* sorry. ((((HUGS)))) \n\nSide note: this isn't necessarily your final goodbye. I know I often take comfort when my parents pop into my mind. I'll hear their favorite song, or my father's favorite show will come on TV and I always feel their love. Whatever **you decide**, I **know you loved your mom, and your mom loves you.**", "So NTA. And I am so sorry. You don\u2019t know your Dad\u2019s grief as being a Husband to his wife. That is some way grown up stuff right there & he doesn\u2019t know yours either.\nBut I will say, nobody should say you don\u2019t care about your Mom. Everyone just deals with loss differently. And we should be allowed that without judgment. \nAll I can say is that it does get easier. The tears do turn to smiles. Not that you ever forget, but it does get easier in time.  That being said, your Mom is all around you now. Just talk to her. I promise, it helps.", "i am so so sorry for your loss. i applaud you for coming on here and seeking advice on this. the part of you that wanted to check if your inclination toward not going was right is the same part of you that wants to go. listen to that part of you - it\u2019s your intuition and it will continue to guide you through these unimaginable times. you are so strong, and your mom is so proud of you.", "YTA. Funerals are about respect. Go to it and then leave if its too much. I dont want you looking back years from now and regreting not going and Im certain that you will regret it.", "Since we technically are supposed to vote, no, you are NTA. Everyone grieves in their own way, and time. Many have shared their unexpected wave of grief hitting them. Some for very specific and special reasons, some, nothing really at all. You are 14. And if you have never experienced a death of someone you loved a lot, or were even decently friendly with,  not even knowing what grief truly is is likely more confusing for you. I get the impression that's why you feel if you don't go to the funeral,  she'll come back. I wish I could tell you that's true. If your dad felt she'd come back if he stayed home, do you think he would go to the funeral? He'd stay right there with you if that's all it took to bring her back. \n\nIt's perfectly okay for you to feel the way you do right now. There really isn't a right or wrong way to feel. That said, your dad is a million percent right. You need to go to tell her, well,  everything you wanted to but thought you had lots more time to tell her. They will give you all the time you need for that. And tell her to rest in love, because you will always love and cherish her. And it's honestly okay if you can't or don't cry. That time and day will come for you when it's ready to. But, it really will be 1 million percent the biggest regret of your life if you don't go. You only have this chance 1 time. There are no do overs for this. Please don't carry that burden with you the rest of your life.", "NTA, but you should go. You\u2019ll most likely regret not taking that chance to say goodbye and get that closure. It\u2019s a day that truly only happens once. As others have said, you\u2019re only delaying the inevitable, and I would hate for you to regret not going later on in life.", "I am sorry you are going through this, you are NTA, but I agree with your dad that you will probably regret it when you are older.", "NTS, because a child in this position can\u2019t be an AH. \n\nI\u2019m a mom of kids your age, and I have lost both of my parents. I was 20 years older than you are now, so an adult. But absolutely not ready to be without my mom.  And then 5 years later lost my dad. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you what is right for you, but your reasoning concerns me, as a mom. It worries me that you want to stay home as an avoidance tactic. Believe me, I completely understand wanting to be able to deny that your mom is gone. But, you can\u2019t. That isn\u2019t reality. So, it might be better to rip the proverbial bandaid off and begin the process of grief while surrounded by others who love you (I hope that is the case). \n\nThe funerals allowed me the opportunity to hear memories from other people. I got to see the people outside of my family who would miss each of my parents. That their impact was larger than the four children and the 6 grandchildren they left behind. \n\nThe funerals allowed me to see that my loved ones were really, truly gone. And it sucked. It hurt. It was a wound in my soul.\n\nBut it had to happen. In order to be able to start the process of healing, I had to start to accept that my mom or my dad was gone. \n\nYou are so young to have to go through this. I\u2019m worried that some day, you may regret not going. You can\u2019t undo that decision. However, you can go, and if it becomes too much for you, find a quiet corner to yourself.  You can ask a trusted person or family member to be by your side for support. But if you don\u2019t go, you can\u2019t undo that. \n\nMy heart hurts for you. I\u2019m not your mom, but I am *a* mom.

During those 18 months, I moved in with my dad (parents were divorced) and had essentially started over with a new life/friends. I left behind my little brother and stepdad. \nI knew she was going to die, so when she finally did, it was easy for me to process. I didn\u2019t cry at her funeral, I was actually excited to see my old friends again (stepdad was the pastor of our small town, so everyone came to her funeral) and used the funeral and burial to hang out with them.\nI had already done my grieving after her accident, she was (in my mind) gone the day the guy ran the stop sign. I still had to visit her while she was in the coma, which was uncomfortable. I only went when my dad made me go.  It wasn\u2019t my mom in there anymore.\nAfter everything was over, I still hadn\u2019t really processed that she was actually dead-dead.  Like, for-real dead. I just thought I was ok with it.\nThen one random afternoon when I was 17, I was being schlepped around town with my dad and older brother visiting antique stores, suuuuper bored.\n\nI came around the corner of an aisle and there she was.  It was my mom, 15ft in front of me in an antique store in Apple Valley. Wearing her blue and white Norwegian sweater with the silver buttons.  She was walking away from me, she didn\u2019t see me.\n\nMy heart sped up and dropped into my butt as my anxiety went through the roof, what would I say? Do I hug her? Would she remember me? Did she miss me?\n\nJust as quickly as the rush of adrenaline hit me, it completely disappeared as I realized that it was just another lady who happened to have the same stature and hair color as my mom, as well as the exact same sweater.  \nI was shattered.  All those years of thinking I was ok, strong, not grieving, not missing her\u2026I was terribly wrong.  I was in denial, just super good at masking my feelings. I wasn\u2019t celebrating or remembering her properly.\nI now am in possession of that sweater. I see it every time I walk into my closet. Whenever I miss her, or am celebrating her, or just feeling a bit cold, I pull it out and put it on.  \n\nOP, I urge you to go.\nIf you want to be alone, show up late and sit in the back, or perhaps the balcony.  Sometimes we\u2019re afraid to go to things like funerals, due to potential emotions we may feel. I sat in the back and sobbed at my grandpas funeral. I just preferred the privacy.\nI was not brave enough to go up to the casket to say goodbye, so I said goodbye from the next room. \nMaybe even going and saying your own goodbye before everyone gets there may be your thing.\nThe point is, feelings are fluid, right now it feels ok to not address your feelings, because you\u2019re just maybe not feeling them yet.  \nBut someday there may be a stranger in a sweater who will fill you with all sorts of stupid feelings and lots of regrets.\nCelebrate your momma, even if it\u2019s just in your heart.\nBest of luck, OP", "I am so sorry for your loss.  I have not lost a parent but have lost a sibling.  I was 18 when my brother passed.  He had MD so I knew my whole life this was coming. No matter how prepared you are you are never ready...

All the hurt, regrets i to this day cannot voice out loud, the pain the saddness.  I went to the funeral but would not cry.  But it always finds a way out.  I became physically ill. Threw up in the sink in the dr exam room then passed out.  There was nothing medically wrong with me. It was psychosomatic. All the emotional pain had to come out somehow.\n\n\nYou are allowed to grieve how you need to grieve. This is personal and.ypurs alone.  But please don't hold it in for anyone. If you don't feel it yet that is fine but don't intentionally not feel it for anyone else's benefit.  You will say good bye as you see fit when you know the time is right.  But remember your family is coming from a place of love and pain. Because they cannot imagine not going, they cannot imagine you not going and still being ok. The love you and want you to be ok.

I'm a huge introvert, social situations exhaust me, and the last situation in which I can cope with that is when I'm also grieving.  \n\nI'm also on the spectrum so overstimulating is a thing for me.  Grief has a way of defeating my coping strategies and making me very uncomfortable very quickly, and feeling like I have to \"be there for family\" is the best way to trigger the kind of mini panic attack that autists know all too well  I'd rather just not go at all than have to suddenly leave in the middle.  Steps on fewer toes, sometimes literally.\n\nThere will be time later, after I've created the emotional space to handle what happened, where we can tell stories about the living and remember them kindly.

When my grandma died it was devastating.

Big Brother Big Sister also had recreational programs.  Talk to your dad and take advantage of these sorts of services.  Grief is complicated and having multiple outlets helps a lot.

My dad was the only one who could comprehend what was happening with me. My mum had cancer twice, and the last time I spent a year slowly watching my mum slip away and my parents had prepared me too well for her passing.

Also, don't feel guilty for how you feel, and don't let anyone tell you how you are supposed to be feeling. For some people the loss hits immediately, others it's the funeral that triggers the sadness and then there are people who won't feel it until after or when some random event will make you go \"holy crap, my mums not coming back\" and you will grieve her when that happens.

Agree to go to the funeral but reserve the option to step outside if it is all too much. That way if it helps you to be there you can stay, if it is a bit challenging you can have some space.

Her soul is gone, somewhere in the ether, all around you and always will be.  Her body however is still here for a couple of days and this is your final chance to see her and be with her.

She was my second mom and in that moment with eating the salad, it made her death final.", "At my stepmothers funeral I discovered that she and my father had an affair before he was divorced from my mother.
