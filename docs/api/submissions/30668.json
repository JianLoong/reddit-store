I didn't go to his funeral, never saw his dead body, never said goodbye. 30 years later, I still startle and expect to see him when I smell pipe smoke, and I feel new pain each and every time he doesn't appear.\n\nMy mom died when I was 15, and I saw her body at the hospital. My dad made sure I saw it. I went to the funeral, I went to the viewing. It was agony. But sounds, smells, sights which remind me of her make me happy. They never give me pain.\n\nI'm so, so sorry your mom died. So sorry. But staying away from the funeral won't bring her back, and missing the chance to see that she has died, missing the chance to say a real farewell, will hurt you a lot and for the rest of your life. And no matter what, you will start being sad soon. You will grieve. Sweetheart, you're already grieving. Trying to short-circuit that is actually really bad for your mental health. You're not fine, you're numb. That will go away eventually and you will hurt so much more if you never say goodbye, if you try to prevent yourself from really understanding that she's gone and from grieving her loss.\n\nMaybe if you can't bring yourself to sit through the funeral, your dad could arrange a short private viewing of your mom's remains for you. Go, get it over with, and hold on to your father when you stop feeling numb. I understand why you want to hold on to the numbness, but frankly you're in shock right now, and shock does not last forever. It doesn't even last for very long. Don't alienate your family over this; *tell them what you've told us.* Explain why you don't want to go to the funeral. Ask them to hold you while you grieve, even if that's something your family doesn't usually do.\n\nMy thoughts are with you; I grieve with you. Yes, that's a Spock quote, but I've never found a better way to say it.", "NTA.\n\nHi! I\u2019m a therapist so I here are my clinical thoughts. You\u2019re right, by not going to the funeral, you can delay the devastating sadness. But it\u2019s just a delay, and that delay could be a day, a week, or a month, but trust that it\u2019s going to hit you. The grieving and sadness are non-negotiable.\n\nFunerals are meant to be a chance to say goodbye, to grieve with other people who loved your mom, and to provide a space to unapologetically feel (or not feel) everything. The funeral is for you, to start moving through the emotions that come with this.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You don\u2019t have to go, but if your reason is to pretend and ignore, that won\u2019t last very long.", "Oh sweetheart, you\u2019re NTA. No one is. But please go. You don\u2019t even know how it might help you. You are going to meet and receive love from people who knew every version of your mom, including the ones you didn\u2019t get to meet. At the end of the day, you will know your mother more fully. And you will gain parts of her that you didn\u2019t have before. This is how we keep them with us - by knowing them. Remembering them. Speaking their name. Meeting with those who loved them, too. You have to be unfairly strong, because it\u2019s your future self who will thank you. And your future self is your mother\u2019s child: care for you with the same foresight as your mother would if she were here.", "NTA, but, trust me when I say that you'll regret it if you don't. Your Mom is never coming back physically, but she will live on in the thoughts and memories of those who loved her, and those she loved. At the funeral you'll be surrounded by these people and you can comfort each other , and begin the grieving process which really can't be avoided indefinitely. Yes, it's hard now. But time will heal you.", " NAH. The only AHs in this scenario are those relatives who say you don\u2019t care. You are still in shock about this great loss and that is not the same as not grieving. I hope for both you and your father\u2019s sake that in 3 days you do find strength to attend the funeral to support your dad. But if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t feel guilty. We all grieve differently.", "I'm sorry for your loss, but, honey, the reality is that your mother is not coming back. You can try to pretend she will, but she won't.  \nIt's a normal thing to feel sad ; forbidding to yourself to feel that way is the unhealthy thing. Sadness is not a threat to your mental health ; sometimes it's a relief that helps you move forward later.  \nI don't think you're an AH, and it's very clear you care about your mom. I think you're a 14yo and it's a complicated thing to deal with. I hope you find someone to talk about it with, in your family or outside of it. NAH.", "YTA, in the softest way.  I am trained as grief counsellor,  you need to go.  You are still holding out hope that she is alive and this is normal, but if you dont go, this can lead to so much more problems down the road.\n\nYou need to go for  your own mental health, you need to mourn  your mother passing, you need to feel that pain to heal.  It is hard I know and  honestly you are too young and you need to listen to your dad.  Oh I wish I could hold your hand and help you in this hard moment in life.   \n\n\nI would also  recommended that you find a book called Brother Lionheart by Astrid Lindgren, it is often given to children  who are grieving.", "It'll be the hardest thing you ever do but you should go. It's easier to go and regret it than to not go and regret it. The first one is over in a day. To not go ... Well you can't take that back and it's with you for life. \n\nJust go.", "My mother died when I was nine.  I wasn't given the chance to go to her funeral, and I wish very much that I had been able to attend.  I've seen photographs, and I think it might have been quite comforting to see that outpouring of love and affection for my mother.  It was bewildering and hard to believe that she was gone and never coming back, and I honestly do understand your feeling of not wanting that horrible confirmation.  But I think you will regret it, if you don't go.  You will come to terms with the situation in your own time, and of course you know in your heart that you must do so, but it could well be that recognising that other people feel the loss too will actually help you.\n\nI've experienced three important funerals in the last three years, and at each one I have learned things about the deceased that I had never known, even though I knew all these people for many years\u2014and it was nice to find out these things.  Every person has a different relationship with everybody else, and these different perspectives can tell you things you'll be surprised by and glad to know.  You're at the age when you were just recognising your mother as a person rather than simply as Mom (I hadn't quite got to that stage), and learning more about the person you knew could be a comfort to you.\n\nYour family members are wrong (and foolish) to accuse you of not caring.  It can be really hard to feel when something so mind-numbingly awful has happened.  That's part of the reason why we traditionally have funerals\u2014to provide a formulaic way of saying a formal goodbye.  They're also an opportunity to share happy memories.  I really think you could benefit from attending, and it would also comfort your Dad to have you there.  He lost her too.  Try, if you can, to attend, not just for your own sake but for the sake of other people who cared about your mother and who think it's important.  Doing the right thing can be its own reward.\n\nI wish I could hug you.  NTA, of course, but I think you're making the wrong decision.", "So sorry for your loss.\n\nI think you're old enough to make this decision for yourself, and please ignore anybody in your life who tries to measure love by attendance -or otherwise - at a funeral. They're trying to guilt you and that's not fair.\n\nHowever, I would urge you to have a really proper conversation with your dad so that you know you've considered all the angles. If he can't have that conversation then get a family friend along to help you all have a fair and blame-free discussion. By doing this, you and your dad will have shared your views and will understand each other a little better.\n\nNTA, of course.", "YTA to yourself if  you don't go.\n\n\"He said that I'd regret it in the future \"\n\nDad is correct.  \n\n\"if I don't go then she might not be dead and she might still come back.\"\n\nThis is very unhealthy.", "First of all, you are not an asshole, your too young still, and second of all, you are still in shock. You are actually in protective mode, not wanting to acknowledge your trama/pain is creating a safe space for yourself.  I can totally relate.  I lost a son and sort of did the same thing you are doing, but it would be a disservice to yourself and the relationship you had with your mother if you don't go, and you will regret it.  I am extremely sorry for the loss of your mother, I hope you will help yourself by seeking out therapy to help deal with this significant loss.  Sending you nothing but positive vibes and I pray you can find your peace.", "My man if you don't go you'll truly regret it in the future,  it's going to be hard,  and you shouldn't have to go through such a thing at your age,  but say goodbye.\n\nIt'll hurt now but it already does,  it'll be a comfort down the road, I promise.", "I am not going to render judgment.  You should be talking to a grief counselor and not a bunch of people on Reddit.", "NTA. And sorry for your loss.\n\nIt is up to you, if you want to say good bye now or at any other time - alone. But what you are feeling right now is not healthy either. You lost someone and you will feel sad at some point. Now you are functioning to keep going.\n\nAre you able to talk about this to someone? A therapeut?", "NAH and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your mom. I think you should go because it will give you the closure you need. I know you\u2019re in a bit of shock but you have to let the feelings in. You have to grieve for your own sake. Your mom is gone whether you go to the funeral or not. And you might regret it if you don\u2019t say goodbye. Plus your dad might need you there. I\u2019m so sorry sweetheart, I know this hurts.", "NAH. But grieving and mourning rituals are important. Totally get the part about the funeral making this loss real, but that\u2019s gonna happen if you are there or not. If you\u2019re there, you\u2019re with other people who love you and your mom, and can hold you up physically, mentally, and emotionally. If you don\u2019t want to talk this out with your dad right this minute, is there someone outside your immediate family you can talk to? Maybe a teacher or a friend\u2019s parent? Someone who is on team you. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom. It\u2019s totally ok and normal to be feeling whatever it is you are feeling right now - numb, sad, pissed off, scared, whatever. Grief is hard and there\u2019s no avoiding it - it will just leak out in a million other ways. But there are people out there who can help you figure out how you keep on getting up every day. Please talk to another adult in your life about how you\u2019re feeling and let them help you. Sending you good thoughts. And this sounds weird but drink lots of water because grief is also real real dehydrating, even if you aren\u2019t letting yourself cry.", "I didn't go to my aunt's funeral 4 yrs ago she was a second mum to my daughter and meant to world to me. I regret every second of it she is my last thought of every day and I hate myself for not saying good bye. I didn't want to I wasn't ready and now I never can. Please don't make the same mistake \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. your feelings are totally valid and i completely get it. but your dad is right, you will regret it.\n\nyou *can* delay the grief, yes, but that's all it will do. the grief will hit you. funerals are there to get closure and say goodbye. like you say, that means she's never coming back. which is the truth. it's really really hard, but you will need to accept that, and it's better to do that with others who are also grieving and going through the same thing.", "Trust me, you have to attend your mother's funeral. It's important to say the last goodbye to you mom. Yes, you might get sad and start crying but that's okay. YTA to yourself because you will regret your decision in the future. Take care OP and I am so sorry for your loss.", ">This is probably gonna make me sound insane but if I go then that means she is dead and definitely never coming back but if I don't go then she might not be dead and she might still come back,\n\nInsane? No. No, no... Not insane. But it's also absolutely not emotionally healthy (imo! I'm not a therapist and wtf do I actually know).  \n\n\nYou do need to accept that she IS gone, and ISN'T coming back.   \n\n\nBUT, how you choose to do that is your own journey. If you think this will be easier for you by not going to the funeral, then that is understandable.\n\nBut it may be helpful in MANY ways for you to \"say goodbye\" and get some CLOSURE. That is what your dad is likely referring to.   \n\n\nThat said, consider the others' in your family. You don't think that maybe any of them (especially your dad?) may want your presence and support there? You aren't in this alone, and neither are the other people who lost your mom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may not feel anything now, but you also may get smashed in the face by grief like a metric tonne of bricks in the near future.  \n\n\nNAH. But really give it some thought and make SURE you don't want to go to the funeral. Because it's not a decision you can undo. Once the funeral is over, it's over.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I agree that you may regret not going to the funeral and it may be helpful to help your brain wrap itself around the reality of her passing.  That said, no one should be making you feel bad about your desire not to go and it's very normal to feel numb for awhile after someone close to you dies.  Grief is normal, natural and trying to avoid it will only cause you bigger problems down the road. Feel your feelings and  I highly recommend seeing if  there is a grief counselor in your area to help you walk through this experience as those around you are also grieving and may not be able to help as much as they want to.", "I'm sorry for your loss.  Search your soul and do what feels right for you. No judgements.", "NAH \n\nIt sounds like you can't face the finality of the funeral.\n\nHowever it is important to your father that you go.\n\nYou need to speak to him.", "NTA however you aren\u2019t dealing with the reality of the situation. Your mom is gone and she isn\u2019t coming back and sooner or later it will hit you (whether you go or not) and yes your dad is right that when that happens you will likely regret not going to her funeral.

Maybe think about it a little more.", "I'm not going to call you an AH but I think you should go.  The whole point is to feel your grief.  You can't avoid it forever.  That's just going to cause you problems.", "NTA for having your reasons while grieving a fresh loss. But I think your dad is right. You will regret not going in the future.", "My dad always said funerals weren't for the deceased but for the living that knew and loved the deceased", "I'm sorry for your loss. You don't sound insane, but you sound like you're in total denial. I can't blame me you, but yeah, it's not healthy. I also think you'll regret not going. You're so young, you shouldn't go through this tough time alone. Hope you have people close to you that can help you and be of emotional support. Also, don't be afraid of seeking professional help, like seeing a therapist to help with your grief process.", "I am so so so sorry for your loss. \n\nI understand that what you are going through is incredibly difficult and that part of you wants to avoid it by not going, to pretend that it's not happening. But I believe that it is important that you go. It might be painful but it will also be cathartic, it will help you in your process of grieving and healing from your loss. I know in retrospect that it was incredibly important for me when my mum died. Think of a person that you would like by your side, someone you could lean on (your dad, another family member, or one of your friends), and ask them to stand by you and help you through it.\n\nAgain, I am really really sorry for your loss\n\nSending you a big hug <3", "NTA- but I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t been to many funerals. \n\nThey are about listening to stories about her life, see her through others eyes and giving her remains the respect she deserves. \n\nStopping doing something because it will make you sad isn\u2019t any better for your mental health than ignoring the whole situation and hoping it will go away. That\u2019s not a good pattern to start so early in your life. \n\nGo to the funeral, see family and celebrate her life.", "NTA, but you're in denial. I think you probably need to attend the funeral, realize she really is gone, and allow yourself to grieve. Ignore the BS about not caring about your mom. Those people need to be emotionally present for you, not lecturing you and making you feel bad.\n\nI'm so sorry. It must be so hard. But there is a grieving process, and trying to escape it won't be good for you in the end.", "Oh kiddo, NTA. However yeah your dad is right, if you don\u2019t go to the funeral you will probably will regret it in the long term because you won\u2019t get that chance to say goodbye. In the short term? Yeah it\u2019s going to be awful but it\u2019s better to be sad now than to let the pain fester. Also have someone to talk to, preferably a therapist but a friend or a family member who you trust can help too.", "I am so sorry for your loss.

I would say that like, at some point it is worth doing your own thing in honour of your mum but it doesn't have to be right now. As for the not coming back, I regularly go and chat to my mums ashes where we buried them and there are still moments for a second I forget she's dead and I can't just call her or text her.

Grief is no joke, and it feels horrible and heart wrenching. \nIt can make you angry too and that's ok.\n\nYou cannot run from it though. \n\nYou may also regret not being there, for your family and for your mum. You'd know best what she would have wanted and whether or not she'd want you there with your family. Sometimes the choice that honours your loved one most is a painful choice.\n\nThere's no real right or wrong answers, but you will experience grief and it will be horrible, but the hope is that rather than cling to that horrible feeling you can cling to what you love about her.\n\nMy sisters kids know all about my brothers who have passed away even though they never met them, we share their essence in stories and so their memory is very much alive.\n\nGood luck OP, sorry for your loss.\nIt will lbe hard, and you'll grow and get stronger.", "I had a major loss when I was around your age. It hurts so much because we really aren\u2019t prepared to handle such a loss, so young. I\u2019m very sorry you have to go through this. \n\nSo there is no sugarcoating that all of this is going to suck, really hard, for a while. No one will be able to say or do anything that makes the pain better. But going through the motions alongside your supportive family is the best thing you can do to take care of yourself, and them. Family gets us through these hard times. Having things to do, even the most mundane things to do - keeps us from going mad with all of our big feelings of grief. Grief is a very heavy feeling to carry around, so try to share the load with your family and friends. \n\nI did the same thing back then, I kind of pretended that they were gone on vacation or something, because remaining in denial was just easier. It worked for about 3 years. BUT Stuffing our feelings of grief down to deal with later can turn into to big explosive feelings that seem uncontrollable - and tend to spill out at the very worst times. When my numbness wore off and the grief finally appeared it was bigger and even more unbearable - and since it was so many years later I mostly had to deal with all these big emotions on my own. \n\nAs sad as we are to lose them, there is something really beautifully in honoring our loved ones when they pass. Do try to go, to honor and celebrate the time you had together. For your own closure, and to support your family. It really will mean more to you later than it seems to now. Big hugs.", "Oh, honey, I'm so sorry this has happened to you. There is nothing good about losing your mom when you're fourteen years old. In fact, losing your mom may be the worse thing that could ever happen to you and your dad. Because of this, emotions are running high. Grief has this strange way of making people half crazy sometimes for a short period, often for longer. When it's fresh and new, no one is thinking straight. There is too much loss taking up all the space. The world has just ended for those who loved her and I get that you'd probably just rather crawl straight under the covers and stay there until it's all over. That's all normal. Right now, no one's thinking straight and everything is upside down. I'm guessing your dad is taking this very hard so it's equally very hard for him to support you in the way he ordinarily might. He's reactive for good reason. I've been in this situation and it's gut wrenching when everyone is falling apart around you and you're basically useless in that you're so overwhelmed, you can't help. So, here's the thing about funerals; they're not really for the dead, they're for the living. It's a way for people to come together, remember someone they loved or cared about and to show their respects to the family who are grieving. Family, friends, neighbours, anyone who may also be reeling by this terrible loss  want to have the opportunity to pay their respects and show they care. It's a show of respect and solidarity, love because there is nothing else they can do, apart from delivering the odd casserole or two. There's nothing else anyone can do but tell you they're sorry and tell you if there's anything you need, you're to call them. You won't likely, the grieving are immobilized, but they want you to know the offer is there. Most people don't know how to deal with death is also true. As your mom's daughter, it would be helpful if you could be in solidarity with dad and the rest of the family for this one occasion - if you are able. After that, your world will change as the days, and weeks, months and years go on. But sometime in the future, I promise you, you'll be glad you went to your mother's funeral. You've a hard road ahead, and I wish you and your dad nothing but love. I'm sure your mother would have wished for the same.", "You are definitely NTA.\nI am so sorry you have lost your mom. I can\u2019t imagine what you are feeling. Adults don\u2019t know what to do either. Because we can\u2019t make it better. And we do want to make it better for you! \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go. it won\u2019t bring her back (believe me, I know). And going will probably make you sad. But it\u2019s normal and actually healthy to be sad. To feel. To express how you feel. Because if we keep the feelings inside it makes us sick after a while. \n\nWhatever you do, try to let out how you feel: tell someone, write it down, scream, say it out loud\u2026.whatever you want. But feel.", "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you at this time in your life. You are definitely NTA. That said, I think you should go. Maybe just for an hour. Maybe just stay in a cry room at the funeral home or if there\u2019s a church service, stay in the back. It will matter to the future you. Maybe ask your dad if you can go but be hidden? If maybe he could meet you in the cry room every so often if he needs support. Maybe other relatives can help host. \n\nWhen my mom died, I was 28, and I understand the feeling that it wasn\u2019t real. It lasts for a little while I think because it\u2019s such a shock. I mean, she had a long illness, but I was still so surprised. I had a hard time at the gathering that followed at her house. I kept briefly hugging people, crying and then hiding upstairs because I just couldn\u2019t take it. Even so, it was good that I tried. \n\nNo one should tell you how to grieve, but I wouldn\u2019t want you to feel later like you missed this part of her life. Would she have wanted you to go? Is your dad maybe upset because he\u2019s grieving as well and can\u2019t process that he\u2019ll have to say goodbye to his wife alone, without you there? I hope you talk more to him about this. He loves you and knows you\u2019re hurting, and he\u2019s hurting too.", "NTA, I lost my mum last year. I am older than you, but the funeral felt like a chore, that it was for other people to grieve her. Not me.\n\nBut on the flip side of that, I made sure to start dealing with my grief and to allow myself to feel what I needed to feel", "Nah \n\nNo one is in the wrong here.  I think you should talk to someone professional about this because it\u2019s a complex thing at any age.  But if I can offer some things to consider - 1). you mom\u2019s situation isn\u2019t changed by you going or not and that will be something you eventually have to reconcile yourself with.  2) going to a funderal is about honoring her so maybe you don\u2019t do it for you but for her 3). You may regret not going and having the opportunity to have that final goodbye - you may not but I think you should give it consideration to it", "I\u2019m so sorry, may your memories be a blessing.   That being said, funerals are for the living.  They make some people feel good, some people like the sympathy (a lot of people do not).   You can remind your dad that you can talk to your mom whenever you want, and you can go to the cemetery when you are ready.  Everyone grieves and deals with death differently.  The pressure is because the \u201cnorm\u201d is to have a funeral and everyone goes to be sad and celebrate all at the same time.  take care of yourself, find someone to talk to and if you need to ask your dad or a trusted relative to find a doctor of you.", "Life is full of experiences, both positive and challenging, that shape us as individuals. It's important to recognize that avoiding certain experiences can limit personal growth and development. While it's understandable to have reservations or fears, facing and embracing life's experiences can lead to valuable lessons, personal resilience, and a broader perspective. By actively engaging with different situations, we expand our understanding of the world, develop new skills, and discover our own strengths and capabilities. It's through these experiences, both pleasant and difficult, that we gain wisdom, empathy, and a deeper appreciation for life. Embracing life's experiences, even the challenging ones, can ultimately lead to personal growth and a more fulfilling journey. You may read this and still gain no intuition due to your undeveloped brain.", "It\u2019s your choice, but it\u2019s a chance to be with other people and grieve for your mum together, say goodby together, you go to the wake and talk about her and her life. Weeks down the road you will still be grieving but others that didn\u2019t  love her as much as you will have moved on with their lives, and that can feel insulting that everyone else is managing just fine without her. Honestly it feels like honouring the person, them being important to everyone while they say goodbye. Being together with your family can bring you closer, seeing everyone being upset about her loss is somehow better then being isolated in your grief and feeling like no-one else cares. I would argue that it helps your mental health. And I do think that one day you may regret missing being part of the last event that was about your mum.", "I am so very sorry for your loss! I lost my mom unexpectedly when I was 26 and it was so hard. Please do not be afraid to reach out to others when the feelings get to be too much or to seek out counseling. \n\nIt will get easier in time. Remember your mom will always be with you in your heart and your memories.", "As many have pointed out, your Dad is right - it\u2019s highly likely you\u2019ll likely regret it if you don\u2019t go, and it doesn\u2019t make him a lame clich\u00e9 person for thinking that. It doesn\u2019t make you an AH if you don\u2019t go either- everyone grieves differently and denial is one of the first stages. But you will probably hurt those around you, and in the end you may hurt yourself. You can never go back in time and change this. Hearing people talk about how much they loved your Mom might be a way to connect and learn something new - most funerals I attend I learn something about them I didn\u2019t, and it makes me love them even more.\n\nI know that feeling of disbelief and avoidance - most of us do. We\u2019re never ready to realize someone is truly gone. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing such a horrible loss so young :( Just remember that your Dad is hurting too, and navigating something new. I\u2019ve experienced family tragedy too, and sometimes parents screw up and don\u2019t handle it how we want. It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love and want what\u2019s best for you. \ud83e\udd0d NAH", "NTA I'm so so sorry for your loss. My mother passed away when I was 14 also. Losing a parent in general is tough, but especially at that age. People grieve in different ways so you wouldn't be the AH if you didn't go. I completely understand your logic for not going, but at the end of the day you do need to understand that she is gone whether or not you go to the funeral. It's going to be hard to go, but I think you will regret not going down the road once you've had a chance to fully process everything. This is your opportunity to say your final goodbyes, which you may not think you need but you do. Try to remember that your father lost her too. The funeral will be hard on him, but I'm sure having you there with him during this trying time will lessen the pain. \n\nI was really reluctant to go to my mother's funeral, but for a different reason. My mom was really sick for years, so when she died I was relieved because she was suffering and death ended that for her. I was worried going to the funeral would replace that relief with grief, and I didn't want to grieve her because it felt selfish. In the end I did end up going, and I'm so glad I did. I got to hear stories about her I had never heard and see pictures of her I had never seen. In a sense I got to know my mom a little more at her funeral. If I hadn't gone I wouldn't have gotten that, and because I did I have more memories of her which I will forever cherish. I got to say my final goodbye to her, and I even wrote her a letter that I was able to put in her casket so that even in death, she has a part of me with her which gives me great comfort. I'm not saying you have to do any of this, I'm just sharing my experience. Funerals aren't for the dead really, they're for the living. And going to my mom's funeral, even though I didn't want to, helped my grieving process immensely.\n\nWhatever you decide, just remember she'll always be with you. As long as you live on, so does she. You are a part of her. Keep your chin up. The pain never goes away but I promise you, coping with the pain gets easier with time.

Regret is truly one of the most difficult things to cope with and you will most definitely regret not going when you're older. Some days you just have to get through, sorry bud.", "You're not an asshole. But you are in grief and grief is really strange. It affects us all differently, and it changes over time. I think you'd regret not going, and that this is the wrong set of justifications for a moment in time you can never get back. Believe me, noone wants to go to their mother's funeral. But you should go.", "You will regret not giving your mom a proper goodbye. Even if you do something away from the funeral, do something to mark your respect and the love that will be with you. \n\nI promise, it will hit you. It will feel like it hits you every minute of every day some days. 10,20,30 years later, it will hit you when and where you dont expect. \n\nWhen some time has passed, you will feel it as something beautiful. Love. Care. Smiles. Some wonderful reminder will come. Some lament that is still, somehow, poetry in your heart. \n\nIt will never be okay. You will grow around grief, but it will forever be there. But whether youre at the funeral or not, she is alive in your heart and spirit. \n\nHold onto that, and the fact you got 14 years of memories to take with you. They will be a comfort. Write down everything you remember - you won\u2019t forever. And it will be a cherished piece of you that can be visited. \n\nIm so sorry for your loss. Take the space and time you need.

It happened 20 years ago and I literally still cry and want my mum. But I know she\u2019s not here. The funeral was really sad. But also a celebration. I met people I didn\u2019t know and they told me awesome stories about her that I didn\u2019t know. But made my heart swell. \n\nI won\u2019t give a judgement because it\u2019s so unfair.

I'm sorry. \n\nAs many others have said, most far more eloquently than me, I think you should go. Delaying the reality won't help you in a long run, or even the short term to be honest. \nMy dad died after a short illness in 2015 and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that some of my fondest memories of him and that time were from his wake and funeral (Irish traditional funeral). \nThe love I saw being poured out for him, the widespread community grief, the stories and memories people shared, it gave me a whole new perspective on my dad. O knew he was awesome, I knew his life story, but I didn't know him as Joe, the secretary of the local hall committee, the pioneer, the workman, the music man etc etc. I heard some fascinating stories and all these things helped me process the grief, and take comfort in how much support we had, how loved he was and in turn how loved we were. \n\nObviously, we don't know the family circumstances or your mums personality, other siblibgs etc, but I had to comment and just share my perspective. The other thing is, and it's unfair as you're so young still, your dad most likely needs you with him, for support, comfort and to know that you are ok. It will be hard enough to attend such s funeral and be chief mourner but to be missing your son too, might be really tough. It's not your job to mind your dad, but there's a comfort in having your family with you at such a tough time. \nIf you are struggling with it still, perhaps ask a friend to sit with you for support, or maybe a cousin you're close to, just to have someone extra to support or distract you. \nUltimately of course this is your decision, and it's difficult, but try to explain or chat with your dad, just so he can see where you're coming from. \nIf it's a religious service, maybe being involved in deciding the prayers etc might help, or speaking to the officiant before to know what's to expect. \n\nFinally, my sincere sympathies on your loss, as someone else said, grief will come in whether you allow it or not, sometimes its easier to ride the waves as they come, rather than fighting it and ending up in deeper waters. Or something nautical like that. \nPlease consider grief counselling once the funeral is over, there's a lot to process and it's ok to need help.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.

I got to say good bye and grieve with my family, I shared funny stories about my poppa and heard some from his childhood. It was sad and I cried a lot but it helped me so much just being there with other people who loved him and seeing others feeling the same way I did made me realize it\u2019s okay to be sad.

Maybe not now but eventually and the funeral will not only give you a chance to say goodbye, but will also help you face the reality of your situation, which is more important than you know.  unfortunately, death is a part of life and you\u2019re only delaying the inevitable which could hurt you in the long run.

It doesn't mean you don't care and shame on them for saying that to you. Grief is not a linear process and you'll experience it how you go through it.

I was more worried about whether I had enough food for people than saying goodbye to my mom.\n\nBut it comes, like it comes for us all. The pain will come. The loneliness. The sensing of the empty places she left behind, the finality of never seeing her again, of having life divided between With Mom and now Without Mom.

When you start feeling it, it's like a bouncy ball in a very small box: every time it hits a wall, every time *you* get reminded, you feel that grief. Time passes... the box gets bigger, and the bouncy ball hits the walls less often, but it never really goes way and never really stops bouncing; only the box grows. It'll still hit you years from now at weird little moments.\n\nSo you might not feel it at the funeral, even if people expect you to. And that's okay. It's okay to say that, \"it hasn't hit me yet\", there's a *reason* we say that.\n\nBut you should go, anyway.

Visit the grave/marker on your own time.", "okay thank you so much I don't really know what I'm gonna do but the replies helped me out a lot thank you.\n\nI'm sorry for your losses", "This is said perfectly", "Also, funerals are a great way to learn of other sides of someone that you may never have seen as their kid.\n\nAgreed with the grief being non-negotiable. OP, as someone who is currently 4 years minus a day out from when her Dad died, lemme give you a little preview. My dads favourite food was fruit mince pies. Seeing them at the shops after his death caused me to break down in the middle of the supermarket. You'll have something like that happen, you won't be able to control it and there is nothing wrong with that.\nYou'll miss the sound of her voice, the way she would have made things, her scent. Reminders will hurt a tonne and that is normal. The grief also won't really shrink, you'll grow around it, it'll take a while but it will eventually get easier.", "Very well said, I did this with my Grandma when I was around the same age as OP, I don\u2019t regret not attending.  I still got to say my goodbye when I was ready.  Grieving takes its own time for each person.  NTA", "alright thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f", "What a beautiful and complete response.", "this is so beautifully said <3", "thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f", "I'm crying, thank you for those beautiful words for this young man.\n\nI hope he reads them", "Damn I\u2019m bawling this was so beautiful\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94", "Except you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re basing this entirely on your own experience. There\u2019s nothing I regret more than going to my brother\u2019s funeral and seeing him in that casket. That sight broke me for the rest of my life. If OP doesn\u2019t feel they can do it, we shouldn\u2019t be guilting them into going based on only our own experiences. This is OP\u2019s choice, not yours.", "alright thank you <3", "ok thank you sm", "Unhealthy, yes. Understandable? Also, yes.", "mhm alright thank you I'll think about it", "thank you, I don't know I'm not sure", "And if you delay it, it hits you so much harder than you think it will.", "okay I'll think about it thank you sm", "shit alright sorry. Thank you", "If you don't have anything better to say here walleybdarn, then please shut the fuck up. You, walleybdarn, are most definately an asshole.", "[deleted]", "wdym by concerning? also thank you", "thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Forgot to say, people saying that you don't care, that's BS but grief can make people say stupid things. My friend lost her mum shortly after my dad died and she dealt with her loss differently to me. She was able to compartmentalize her grief and could 'control' it better than me, I needed to talk about it and feel my feelings as they came. So, don't pay any attention to that being said, everyone copes differently. Also, journalling might be a good way to process things.", "thanks so much <3 \n\n sorry for your loss", "It literally is about him. His mom is gone and he's left without her. While I may agree that being around other people who loved her could help with the grieving process, seeing the dead body of a loved one decorated in a casket most certainly is not. Unless it's closed casket or a memorial, he has every right to not want that image as the last one of his mom burned into memory for the rest of his life.", "Pd: sorry for my bad english (just in case)", "when my mom died,  I went to the funeral,  but I had previously found places where i could \"escape\" if it for to be too much, or if I just needed to catch my breath or cry privately. This was my compromise I made with my Gram (her mom). I'm glad I went,  I'm glad I had a plan to resettle my emotions, and I've never forgotten the power of being in a room of people who loved her so much!! I was able to lean on some of those people later,  based on how they treated me that day. It helped.  A lot.  So maybe it's not \" go, or don't go\" -- maybe it's \"try it,  but with a plan\"?\n\nalso,  I am forever grateful for how amazing the funeral directors were.  they helped me find my hidey-holes, and did such a good job on her presentation that it totally erased the image I had of her that was from when she was very,  very ill. They offered to let me see her first,  alone,  then the other family members. For me,  it was the perfect option.", "We are sorry for your loss too <3", "When my brother and I were little, our father used to sing a certain carol to us in a high, squeaky voice, and we thought it was the most hilarious thing in the whole wide world. Six months after he died, neither of us had thought about it, but on Xmas Eve, people began singing that carol, and my brother and I instantly burst into tears. Seven years later, we still get choked up when we hear it \u2013 but we also love it, because it was something only the three of us shared; no one else ever even heard it.\n\nOP, I think your father is right; you will almost certainly regret it later if you don't go. But I think, while it will be hard, that you will find it much more comforting and meaningful than you think. It will help to see how many other people loved, miss, and will remember her (even though their love for her was different from yours, and their loss is not as great), and to hear stories about her that you hadn't heard before.", "Beautifully and thoughtfully said.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.  I get it \u2764\ufe0f", "thank you, I'm sorry for your loss", "My grandmother passed away almost a decade ago and I read the giving tree for the first time since her passing a couple nights ago and I lost it.  Me, an almost 40 year old grown ass man. Sobbing uncontrollably.  You never know when things like that will happen.  But it passed, and I realized it was just because of the memories associated with that book/poem and my grandmother reading it to me as a child,  I never understood the message of the poem as a child, but reading it now.  Yeah..", "Your last line really hit home. My dad died when I was 14. I'm 62 and a grandma now. I still miss him.", "You\u2019re so welcome, kid. I am a mom to a 14 year old. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through and I know she didn\u2019t want to leave you. But I also know you did and you will make her so proud. You were the greatest joy of her life.", "Don't listen to that idiot.", "You shut the fuck the up. I simply told the child the truth. While the rest of you guys were beating around the bush hoping she'd figure out the truth when she's 18 19 20 years old. Some things in life you just have to do because it's the right thing to do. I'm sorry she lost her mother. But that was not her concern she said she was fine with all of that. You're probably another one of those losers and another one of those ass clown generations.", "Refusing to acknowledge your Mother is dead and refusing to go to the funeral so they can pretend she'll come back some day is bad. It's super unhealthy.", "It's complete and utter denial. You said it yourself, you'd rather not go and pretend some day she'll come back. \n\nShe isn't. And I understand that's terribly painful. But lying to yourself not only is going to harm you, but possibly even alienate yourself from your family.", "Thank you <3", "This is an excellent suggestion, having somewhere to hide during the funeral when it gets too much.\n\nOP,  it might help you to see and talk to people at the funeral, see how much your mum is loved and missed. And you will get a different perspective on what she was like as a person beyond being your mum.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "This made me cry.", "I found out my grandmother eloped at her funeral. Her best friend told me. I said \"Mamma eloped?\"  out loud and my dad, aunt, and uncle all were like, what? No one knew. It was so out of character for her. OP I'm so sorry for your loss, I lost my mom 25 years ago. I hope your happy memories comfort you always, I know mine do.", "You're obviously going through a lot and I hope you take this Internet stranger's advice to heart:\n\nHave your support system ready. After the funeral it's going to feel like everyone just goes back to their lives but your grief is just beginning because now there's nothing to do. No funeral to plan, no affairs to get in orders. People will stop asking how you are while you're breaking. Tell people you need help and to be checked on once all the dust settles. \n\nThis is the advice my husband always gives. He lost his mom at about your age and then the mother figure who took him in after his mother's death a few years ago. \n\nI truly wish you the best and you would probably benefit from going even though it will be hard and awful. I didn't go to my friend's funeral for a lot of the same reasons you listed and I really wish I had.", "Omg, you are so kind, your kid is lucky", "Don't listen to me. When all I done was tell the truth. Yes I was hard but at least I told the truth. I keep forgetting that's something that all you f****** don't like to hear is the truth. But life has a way of making you hear the truth.", "oh ok thanks, I'd just rather not think about all of this I guess", "\noh ok thanks, I'd just rather not think about all of this I guess", "What a disrespect to your Mother's memory.", "Goodness me, be kind. He\u2019s hurting and reaching out for advice. There\u2019s no need for that sort of comment. Grief is difficult and different for everyone."]}
