So I thought I'd wait for them to get up and then I'll get it. I waited an hour and they didn't wake up. So I went into their room, retrieved the pen, walked out and closed the door. I didn't wanna wake them up because they had come a long way on a long flight.\n\nMy daughter later confronted me about it, and said she was extremely uncomfortable by what had happened. She said it was inappropriate for me to go in. I was like sure but nothing bad happened. It was not a big deal.\n\nShe was mad and said what if none of them were wearing something appropriate and she insisted that this was an invasion of her privacy. I told her that was not the case. It really wasn't. I didn't even look but I noticed they were only cuddling and they were asleep so nothing was inappropriate in that sense.\n\nMy daughter left much earlier than planned and demands an apology before ever coming to visit again.

So I'm going to point out what I feel should be obvious: It is the year of our dog 2023. You both have cell phones. Text her and ask her about the damn stylus. She'll either grab it and pass it out the door to you or give you the high sign when she and her girlfriend are decent enough for you to come get it.\n\nAlso, in the bigger picture, if you hadn't replaced her bedroom with an office, this wouldn't have happened.

This would be different if she didn't care, as in some very rare cases adult kids don't care that their privacy is invaded by their parents in the way that you invaded hers. But clearly she cares a lot, and you have to respect that. Her leaving much sooner is probably an indicator of how much certain behaviors from you have bothered her in the past, the only difference now is she's an adult and she can take herself out if the situation any time she wants, and avoid you as much and as long as she wants, she no longer has to simply endure you because she no longer lives with you.\n\nApologize and start treating her like an adult.

I think the comment above says it all: it\u2019s kind of entitled to expect complete privacy in someone else\u2019s home. It doesn\u2019t matter if that someone else is your mom.
