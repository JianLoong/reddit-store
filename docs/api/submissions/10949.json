I didn't wanna wake them up because they had come a long way on a long flight.\n\nMy daughter later confronted me about it, and said she was extremely uncomfortable by what had happened. She said it was inappropriate for me to go in. I was like sure but nothing bad happened. It was not a big deal.\n\nShe was mad and said what if none of them were wearing something appropriate and she insisted that this was an invasion of her privacy. I told her that was not the case. It really wasn't.

So I'm going to point out what I feel should be obvious: It is the year of our dog 2023. You both have cell phones. Text her and ask her about the damn stylus. She'll either grab it and pass it out the door to you or give you the high sign when she and her girlfriend are decent enough for you to come get it.\n\nAlso, in the bigger picture, if you hadn't replaced her bedroom with an office, this wouldn't have happened.

This would be different if she didn't care, as in some very rare cases adult kids don't care that their privacy is invaded by their parents in the way that you invaded hers. But clearly she cares a lot, and you have to respect that. Her leaving much sooner is probably an indicator of how much certain behaviors from you have bothered her in the past, the only difference now is she's an adult and she can take herself out if the situation any time she wants, and avoid you as much and as long as she wants, she no longer has to simply endure you because she no longer lives with you.\n\nApologize and start treating her like an adult.

OP is TA but it's not half as huge of a deal as people are making it out to be", "Ah but that would make her look like an assh.... oh, wait.\n\nI think she's all self-justfiied \"but I just went into my daughter's room! all mothers do that!\"", "It's just a feeling I get from the post.", "I think OP is the mother", "Yes, she should. Hosting is frequently inconvenient. You agree to the inconvenience when you agree to host. Not a hard concept.", "Yea when there's other people sleeping in there absolutely. It's called common fucking decency. She knew that. That's why she was going to wait and then decided she was just going to do it anyway. She knew not to, did it anyways and now is facing the consequences of her actions. She should of waited, or knocked and woke them up instead of intruding. Not that hard at all.", "So by that logic, she should be able to go into the bathroom while someone is already occupying it. It's fine because they own the home after all.", "She didn't have to wait. All she had to do was *knock*.", "So when you have guests staying over you just randomly barge into the room they're staying in, without asking, knocking or otherwise making your presence known?", "She could have knocked, she could have called her daughter\u2019s cell phone. I know it\u2019s her house but she violated their privacy.", "Completely agree.  I guess I said adults because it's really likely you are going to see something.  But yes, if a door is closed, knock.", "Nothing in the comment you replied to suggested OP was lying or had a \u201csinister motive\u201d", "if ALL THESE THINGS were true, she still should. have. knocked. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OP secured her YTA by dismissing her daughter's feelings and doubling down on inappropriate action.

It's the natural recognition that there is not ONE objective experience, but we all have our own and you can't decide any others' but your own. The mum can say \"If that was me, it wouldn't have been a big deal\" or she can say \"I thought it wouldn't have been a big deal to you\", and she can say \"It was frustrating for me to not be able to get my stylus\". But she cannot say \"You're overreacting because it wasn't a big deal\".\n\nIt's about empathy and listening to what the other person is experiencing, and to reach mutual respect and seeing each others' needs and emotions. Nothing chaotic about that.", "Babies and toddlers do not have a right of privacy from their parents.", "Honestly, in my parents house, they do this all the time and I don't really care. That's why I say soft YTA, because while no harm was intended, someone did object to it.", "Did they at least knock before they would enter? At most hotels they will at least knock a few times, if they don't get an answer they assume the room is empty and they will enter.", "Right so daughter has stricter boundaries than mom which makes sense bc mom spent years and years tucking her daughter in perhaps even waking her up to go to school. Mom learned daughters boundaries in an unfortunate manner but now she knows they are different and daughter could be understanding of that. And yes sorry but literally anyone that would be going potty in my house would not care if I had to grab the deodorant. Folks have different boundaries that once you are made aware of you should respect.", "Well I would hope they would lock the door. But we have dogs and for years we had a mini goat, so nothing on the floor ever unless you wanted it chewed", "What if they were naked or being intimate? Everyone deserves privacy. It takes two seconds to knock and if they don\u2019t answer try again later.", "As a mum of kids that age I think her daughter is overreacting because it's so unlikely that her mum was coming in for any creepy kind of reason.  She just needed to grab something from the desk and didn't want to wake them.  NAH.", "I still think it would, there's no reason she couldn't have knocked and woken her up rather than barge straight in.\n\nAlmost anyone (barring my partner, in our own house) walking into a room where I'm sleeping without notice is an invasion of privacy and I'd be uncomfortable enough to ask them never to do that again.", "I was thinking that. How simply this would be resolved by \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I needed my stylus and had waited an hour. I tried to be quick and not disturb you. How would you prefer this is handled in future?\u201d", "I am ALL too familiar with that. \ud83d\ude2c", "Bingo!", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Exactly. She said she needed it to get on with work? No you don\u2019t. Use your fingers?", "Now you're just making assumptions", "Oh my bad, I fixed it.", "It stops being her workspace when she has guests staying in it. That\u2019s just common courtesy.", "Yes, they do.", "It wasn't t just her daughter in that room. \n\nYou would walk into the bathroom, without permission even if it was someone you've only met a handful of times?", "But I will be doing some different in the future", "It's hardly a mistake.", "I am understanding of people making mistakes, as long as they apologize for those mistakes. You are calling the daughter an AH for expecting an apology? I got news for you, if someone makes a mistake and doesn't apologize for that mistake, then it ain't a mistake.", "Maybe the daughter would be more understanding if, when she explained her concerns, OP didn\u2019t just dismiss them out of hand. It\u2019s very hard to be \u201cunderstanding\u201d when you tell someone your privacy was violated and they respond that no it wasn\u2019t.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if it weren\u2019t for \u201ccreepy\u201d reasons. What if they were naked? What if they were being intimate? A simple know first would probably solve all of this", "I dunno, I would rather my parent just quietly get the stylus than knock on the door and wake me up for no reason whatsoever. Of course this scenario assumes I am the only one in the room and doesn\u2019t really apply to the OP\u2019s situation.", "Oh I agree.  Just wouldn\u2019t be as bad.  With a stranger there it\u2019s completely ridiculous that anyone would think that\u2019s ok, though.", ":-(", "I mean, it depends on what she does for work. I use a stylus for illustration/graphic design, finger doesn't really work for that ha. \n\nBUT I WOULD KNOCK.", "I have at least 15 pens laying around my house with a stylus either at the tip or on the clicky part (idk what that's actually called.) Seems like every free pen I've gotten has had one over the last 10 years. Are they great? no. Do they work in a pinch? yep.", "That\u2019s quite a leap to make when you have very little information. Maybe OP is a professional artist and the stylus is an essential tool for her job.", "Some ppl need a stylus for visual reasons, coordination reasons, etc. They've typically been much older - 70s/80s. I think it's because they grew up with typewriters not touchscreens. But I personally know someone that cannot use their phone or a fast food kiosk without their stylus.\n\nBut in this case def YTA. OP could have knocked and waited. Or texted for it.", "She OP is a woman", "It was her mother, not her father.", "A baby's right of privacy (if it exists at all in regards to parents)  is very different than an adult's. Privacy is something that varies with age and grows as kids age.", "And that's where you are wrong, same as OP.", "Sounds like they should\u2019ve gotten a hotel instead of crashing at mommy\u2019s, specifically in her workspace.", "Right. My laptop uses a 100 dollar proprietary stylus so that part is potentially true, but it doesn't matter. Still TA because it was still an invasion of privacy because she should have knocked. If it was important enough to keep her from her job, a knock with profuse apology for waking them would have been appropriate.", "That\u2019s the thing, you\u2019d knock and if you did go in to grab it you\u2019d apologise. Not tell them it\u2019s no big deal (to you)", "I guess that\u2019s possible. She says get on with her work and I was thinking a call but maybe she meant continue her work", "Exactly! She should have knocked.", "OP\u2019s knocking stylus was in the room too! That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t knock either.", ">Do they work in a pinch? yep\n\n... Not defending the OP's actions, but no, no they don't, not if you need an actual artist's stylus for a drawing tablet. And they tend to cost enough that you don't have spares. My drawing stylus is almost $100, and without it, I can't do anything. Not \"it's not great\", just plain \"it won't work\", at least not for what I need it for.", "Just checked, I have 5 in my junk drawer.", "You could be right, they did specifically say they needed it for work in the post. I must have missed that part.", "That isn\u2019t the point. She entered a private space without knocking, then blew it off. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. They were just cuddling.\u201d The woman is clueless and tone deaf. Among other things.", "You have your opinion, I have mine. I\u2019ve had this exact situation. They didn\u2019t know I had to go in the room. I grabbed my tablet and slid out. Told my son when they woke up and came out for breakfast. It wasn\u2019t a big deal. The world didn\u2019t stop and we all got dressed and went on with our plans. No harm no foul. More importantly, no big deal.", "You seem sane.", "Exactly. And even if you did think that popping in and grabbing it is ok (because I'm some families, it totally would be), once you were told it wasn't you say \"Oh my gosh I am so sorry. I thought you would prefer to stay sleeping, but my assumption was wrong and I won't do that again.\"\n\n\nIT'S EASY TO RESPECT STATED BOUNDARIES, PEOPLE.", "Yes. Because it turns out we can't just decide how other people feel! Wild, right?", "If you don't knock with a stylus, then the door knocker turns into the Muppet Jacob Marley and you get Christmas Carol'd all night.", "Yeah, but if you have a valuable pen like that, why the blue hell are you leaving it in your guest room?\n\nMy Wacom stylus lives in my work drawer. I use it. I put it back. It's too important and mission critical to risk somebody using it and assuming that it's a dead pen and not a stylus.", "Quite a few people have accused the OP of being either a liar or a homophobe. I don\u2019t think there is any evidence to support either of those conclusions. We don\u2019t actually know that she did not knock. I agree that it would have been better to knock or call them (and wake them up) than to just walk in u announced. I am not sure this rises to the level of AH.", "it really doesn't seem like homophobia, just an invasion of privacy. People who do digital art need a stylus", "Not the exact same situation. You needed the whole tablet. OP simply \"needed\" the stylus. A tablet can be used without that. So, no pressing reason to enter the room. Also, your family, your son, not OPs. Just cause it's no big deal for your family doesn't mean it's the same for others. Yes, we both have our opinions on the matter and on each other's opinions. No hostility here.", "Ah, yes. Casual ableism to make a point. How stunning and brave of you.", "Well, she DID say that the bedroom was actually her workplace usually, so I would assume it's a similar situation.", "And I am guessing your work drawer is in your work room?  That was the room that the guests were sleeping in.  OP was damned whatever she did, knock and wake them, they probably get mad, got in quietly and collect it, they get mad, or delay doing work when potentially some work person gets mad.", "It's not a guest room though. OP said she uses the room mostly as her workspace, it just also has a guest bed. Not that OP is right at all in any of this.", "I wouldn't go in without knocking, but she did say it was her normal work space that doubles as a guest room.", "OP left it in the guest room on purpose, so they would have an excuse to go in there. If the daughter and her girlfriend had not been there, OP would have gone through their things. I\u2019m quite certain the daughter having a same sex partner is NOT okay with OP. This screams missing missing reasons.", "Yeah, that's about the only reason I can see why a stylus would be critical, so chances are just as good that smth sketchy is going on.", "None here either. I think that people like to bring the evil of the world into situations where there really aren\u2019t any. Maybe OP didn\u2019t have another stylus. I only have one and I use my iPad for everything. I work as an independent CS contractor from home and I truly only have 1 stylus so if I lost it I\u2019d be having to make a run to Best Buy.", "Maybe you should log off.", "Or you could use your finger, temporarily, until you have access to the stylus again/bought a new one. That's the issue here. A stylus is not mission critical in the vast majority of cases. Also, privacy is privacy. And it was disrespected. That's a no-go.", "People are people and they do things without a second thought and it\u2019s not always nefarious. OP slid in and slid out. Should she or could she have waited? Possibly. Was there some dark motive behind what she did? Probably not. In the spirit of keeping peace she should just say she didn\u2019t intend to cause a problem and in the future I\u2019ll knock first and keep it moving. If the daughter isn\u2019t satisfied with that then it becomes the daughter\u2019s problem."]}
