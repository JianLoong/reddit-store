My son is a lazy, nasty, disrespectful person. He hasn't had a job in 7 months and isn't really looking for one. He has a video game addiction and doesn't care how he looks or smells when we go anywhere and its embarrassing. He refuses to clean his room and leaves silverware and dried up ketchup in his room, as a result he has roaches in his room and it smells. He doesn't like to bathe and when I tell him that it's been 2+ weeks since he's had a bath he gets mad. He brings friends over without my permission while I'm at work. I tell him about this constantly but he doesn't care and continues to do it. If I tell him to do any small chore while I'm gone not only does it almost never get done unless his girlfriend is coming over. At one point his friend that he had over ended up taking out the trash because my son would not get off the video game. \n I get up to go to work at 5am but because he doesn't want to get off his game so I can sleep I have to tell him every night to go to bed so I can work and he doesn't. Even during the day I tell him not to curse on the game because it's disrespectful to me when he's yelling and screaming on the game in I'm in the room next to him, nothing changed.\n Ive heard him telling his friends that he pays the bills and he could put me and his sister out on the street if he wanted. He barley graduated HS, so he had to go to community college. He spent the money he was given(graduation gift money) to doordash food and pay for food and activities for him and his friends (I found a receipt for $100+ in Korean barbecue) and he dropped out of college after only taking 2 classes. He has stolen money from his sister on multiple occasions and lied about.My son would tell me he was going to use my car to for 1 thing then not come back til after midnight. The only reason he came back when he did was because I threatened to report my car stolen(he also doesn't have a license). When he came back and saw I was upset he asked me what was wrong like he hadn't done anything. I told him he couldn't be trusted and I'd never let him have my car again because of how blatantly disrespectful he was. He just shrugged his shoulders and said ok, as if silently telling me to get over it. He didn't care that he hurt my feelings on mother's day when he cancelled our plans because his friends invited him to a cafe ( which he paid for) and when I told him that I now knew where I stood between him and his friends he didn't respond. I plan on cutting his phone off and when my daughter leaves for college I plan on either moving or taking him off the lease and getting the locks changed. I have told him that I'm tired of the way he acts, what he does and him not trying to help me at all but he doesn't care.

I will add that thing at the end.", "I think he can choose to play quietly. As long as the clicking sounds and the light from the monitor aren't bothering anyone, then it would be a reasonable compromise for any normal adult. Setting a rule for not playing games is like a shared dorm or hostel type situation. It's weird for an adult in a normal situation to just place a rule saying no gaming to another adult that is in their own space. The rule should be more general like no noise after 9PM or something.", "He has a girlfriend, so he is not like that guy.  Video game addict.", "Not when she's been pulling teeth to get him to listen. Again, he isn't a roommate. It's not his own space. It's her space that she is allowing him to remain in IF he follows the rules. If he doesn't like it, he can move out. And let's be honest, he won't be able to play quietly, so he'd be out after one night.", "I think we'll have to agree to disagree. I have two grown adult kids that stayed for a couple of years after college, and two little kids still in elementary school. Regardless of the situation, people should be treated with respect. Obviously, he is disrepectful, but if she turns around and makes a rule that subjects him to being treated like a child then he's likely to respond poorly. If he breaks a rule that is specifically targeted to what he enjoys the most, she might have set herself up to suffer from backlash. If he breaks a general noise rule, it will be easier to kick him out if she needs to. She doesn't become an overbearing parent of an adult child to which he'll probably use that dynamic against her. There's no reasonable thing he can say if he breaks a noise rule. It's common sense and applies to anywhere a person lives. Anyway, I agree with a lot of other people here, the most passive aggressive thing to do is to take away the internet. It might seriously piss him off though, and who knows if he'll become dangerously violent.", "I get the feeling that you really don't understand what I'm saying at all and have no interest in trying to. You're far too focused on trying to make things \"fair\" for someone that should have already been thrown out for any of, I'm sure, a hundred different reasons. \n\nI honestly hope she gives them the rules as I wrote them and he says, \"No way!\" and then moves out. That would literally be the best thing for her. However, if he agrees to those rules, than she has taken out multiple birds with one stone. It's a win/win situation for her.", "I understand you clearly and I don't agree with you. Your interpretation of disagree seems to mean I am not adopting your way of thinking. Disagreeing does not mean not understanding. I am not forcing you to adopt my way of thinking by assuming you don't understand me. This is why I said we could agree to disagree. After all, it's not a forum for discourse. It's to share each other's thoughts on the matter. \n\nI'm less heavy handed, and am sharing my own parenting experience. It seems to work in my own household to treat the adults like adults, regardless of them being my kids. It's hard to have a good argument when either side acts up like kids. I'm simply saying she should keep it at the adult level. I've known some emotionally stunted people that wouldn't understand the situation and think a rule like that is condescending. She'll never be treated respectfully when the other person feels like they are being treated like a child. It's the difference between demanding respect and deserving respect. \n\nAnyway, I respect your answer and hope you respect mine. Both want the same result.

Thankfully, I grew out of that phase in a hurry when they kicked me out; I was homeless for a time, but it was my fault. I am in school, working on my degree, and working full-time. There is no reason he can't do it also.", "I'm sorry, but how am I missing the point when I agree with what your saying? \n\n>I don't think he should stay in her house.\n> With the amount of disrespect she has experienced, he should be gone.\n>I'm pretty sure the only reason she's letting him stay there is because she's worried he'd be homeless.\n\nThis though, is where our thoughts differ, I think;\n\n>The relationship can't get any more strained at this point. \n\nHe is still in her house, which means they still communicate (maybe not well, or maybe he doesn't have many nice things to say), therefore, there is still a relationship none the less. A relationship that still has potential to get worse, if OP suddenly starts trying to enforce rules that son will not adhere to. \n\n\n>As such, I gave her a list of rules that would likely get him to move out, but would likely assuage her guilt over it.\n\nThis is guaranteed to become a massive argument between OP and her son. The rules seem to be a silly way of beating around the bush, and prolonging the inevitable when the end result will be the same = son getting kicked out. Son isn't going to follow these rules. We already know this. \n\nKeep it as simple as possible by just giving son an adequate notice of eviction. 30 days minimum, 45 if OP feels generous. Op shouldn't feel guilty or bad, but needs to be stone cold while evicting son and follow through.\n\nIf son wants to argue with someone, let it be with someone other than OP, like a landlord. They'll definitely enforce your suggestions that OP wasn't able to; like paying rent and keeping their living space clean. \nOr a boss, they'll enforce hygiene if he wants to keep his job, which he now desperately needs to afford his rent at his own place. \nThose are arguments that will make son learn, and coming from others beside mom or sister, means he cant be mad at them for the harsh words he'll be getting. Hopefully it'll knock some sense of respect and appreciation for all the things his mom did and he will want to rebuild strained relationships with mom.", "You agree with what I'm saying, but you don't agree with what I'm saying. Got it. Thanks for explaining. \ud83d\ude44", "Ultimately, we both agree son should be kicked out, that should be the end result. Son moves out...so sounds like we're still on the same page \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI just don't think mom needs to present a list of rules that son will not follow, argue with OP about, bully OP into backing down/not following through, and cause her more stress. THATS unnecessary. \n\nJust present son with eviction notice and date. Short, simple and to the point. You can't argue with an eviction notice, but you can argue with a list of demands (and son would definitely argue thinking those are unreasonable demands) OP doesn't need that unnecessary additional stress.", "You absolutely can argue with an eviction notice.

Here's a suggestion... don't do that.\n\nAnd no, you don't understand what I'm saying, clearly, and it's evident from each comment you make. I'm simply reiterating my points so that they don't get lost in the sea of your misinterpretation.\n\nAnd less heavy-handed? Not likely. Not based on our interaction here.\n\nHere's a thought-- instead of commenting on someone else's comment and trying to suggest your way is better, or whatever you were trying to do originally, and then trying to interpret what someone else is suggesting when that person keeps telling you that you aren't interpreting it correctly, just respond to the OP. Don't start a discourse with another commenter. You can easily tell OP about your perfect children and how you deal with them perfectly, and how your way is the best way, and you can give her a list of rules that can even be a carbon copy of what I said without rules 7 and 8. Go for it. Just stop pretending that you understand my points when you clearly do not.", "Discourse was a poor choice of word since we are ending up debating a non issue, but I can't think of any other word to say we are sharing our own ideas and sharing in a discussion instead of arguing. (At least, that's what I thought). Where in what I have stated says I believe my way is better, and where does it say I have perfect children? I shared my experience of knowing emotionally stunted people that would think a rule like that is condescending and rebel even more. I have had my share of dealing with young adults that think they are still kids and I shared how I deal with that.  \n\nYour first comment said to treat him like a child. I say treat him like an adult with adult expectations.  I never said your recommendation was worse than mine. In fact, I said I disagree, and made a recommendation to similarly address the root issue of the noises made. Again, disagree does not mean misunderstand or misinterpret. It means disagree. There is a reply button on comments so people may comment on what another person said. Maybe Reddit could use an option that prevents a reply in case someone doesn't want to hear someone else's  feedback in case it is in disagreement with them (I think I'll submit that recommendation now btw). I apologize if anything I said offended you.  I can see why your approach of enforcing a rule to address her lack of sleep are not the same as mine. We simply have different ideas. Everyone is different and for me that's okay to have different ideas. Like I said, agree to disagree. There is nothing wrong  or ridiculous about not agreeing with each other, unless however you truly feel people should always agree with your comments. If that is what you believe, I respect your preference, and will delete everything that I replied back with, so it doesn't read like someone disagrees with you. Feel free to let me know. Or you can simply downvote the reply. Your call."]}
