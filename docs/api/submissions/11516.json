My best friend is one of the organisers, it\u2019s for people who love the same music. I do like that music, but it\u2019s not my only interest or my whole personality. I\u2019m a LGBTQ+ POC, so is my best friend, 95% of the group is straight, white, able-bodied etc- this is important later. \n\nThe problem is the group only want to go to the exact same places every single time that play that music. It is so hard to get them to agree to go out anywhere else, unless it\u2019s late and the place they want is closed. We live in a city where there\u2019s 100s of options, but they only go to the same 2-3 places. The 1 nightclub they like is very loud, nowhere to sit, same playlist every single time. \n\nI got injured last year, and now have a disability that affects my mobility, where I need to take breaks to sit down semi-regularly. At this nightclub, if I need to sit down I have to go sit somewhere away from everyone, or go sit on the pavement while people smoke (I don\u2019t smoke). I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of this nightclub before anyway, but I resent having to go there now. \n\nRecently we all wanted to go on a camping holiday, I spent ages researching disability friendly camping options, and presented them with lots of choices. They all decide to pick somewhere I couldn\u2019t go, because it was somewhere they went before. It\u2019s literally wild camping by a lake, not something special they couldn\u2019t find elsewhere. I was really annoyed at first that they excluded me after getting excited about the holiday- if they\u2019d just said before they were going somewhere unsuitable I wouldn\u2019t have spent all that time researching. I got over it though. \n\nIt\u2019s my birthday next month, and I\u2019ve asked if we can go to a LGBTQ+ place I like instead. Most of the group have said they will join for pre drinks but will go to their nightclub after. Now I\u2019m pissed off and find this rude, because I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t accommodate me once after I\u2019ve had to make so many compromises for them. I\u2019m starting to feel like they are not very inclusive or sensitive towards anyone/anything that is different. \n\nAITA overthinking this?", "created_utc": 1677990963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11inmdz/aita_for_wanting_everyone_to_change_what_they/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you don't owe them anything.\n\nAnd you met them \"through a meetup group\" -- those are generally loose affiliations at best. \n\nWould you rather have a friend group that values you for you? Or a friend group that you have to make do something they wouldn't ordinarily do?", "This was a Meetup group that went to the same few venues that play the music the group was about. They're not AHs for not changing from that.\n\nThe camping trip seems outside that group. So, a group of friends started planning a camping trip. It's not clear how much you were included, or if they consider you part of that external friend group.\n\nFinally, your birthday. You can invite anyone you want to your birthday, anywhere, and they're free to accept or decline. They've told you that they won't spend the whole time at the place you like. So definitely NAH for that.\n\nThey may be AHs for excluding you from the camping trip, but mostly here it just sounds like a bad fit--you're trying to change an existing group with a stated purpose. You say it's to accommodate you but except for the camping (which, again, is well outside the original music group), they don't seem to be trying to exclude but just to keep doing what they like. If you show up at one local watering hole and then decide everyone should go to a different one because you like it better, you're the AH.\n\nMake friends at the places you like. This group does seem to accommodate somewhat--they've agreed to pre-drinks to celebrate your birthday--so tell them how you feel, and then join them only if you can do so comfortably. It doesn't really seem to be about your disability, just that you're not that close as friends, and that group is into their own thing.", "NAH\n\nI get it, going to the same places over and over isn\u2019t something you\u2019re into. You\u2019re not the AH for wanting more. They aren\u2019t the AH either though. You met them in a meet up group because of a shared interest. Perhaps this is really all of you have in common and that\u2019s okay.", "NAH, but\u2026 you met these people because they liked a certain kind of music.  The venue they want to go to is a place that plays that music.  That\u2019s the shared interest.  It\u2019s like complaining that a board game club won\u2019t go to a football game with you instead of playing board games.  They may not like football.  They may not want to spend their social time and money there.  A few may join you, but the club isn\u2019t about that.  That doesn\u2019t make them bad.  Wanting them to go doesn\u2019t make you bad.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to have your birthday where you want and invite them, but that doesn\u2019t need to supplant their interest.  I do think you consider them better friends than they consider you.", "NAH\n\nyou met over a shared interest....for them this is all they like and what they want to do.\n\nIt is fine to have different groups if friends...when you feel like doing that thing  go with them. When you doint, don't.\n\nThe camping thing was pretty shitty.\n\nThis group is very set in their ways and don't like change. They are happy for you to come with them but not change.\n\nExpecting a whole group to change their plans to something they don't enjoy is a pointless fight.", "This is a club... Not a friend group.", "Soft YTA - If the meet up group is for a type of music, then you can\u2019t be mad they only want to do thing surrounding that type of music", "NAH maybe they are AHs about the camping trip, Ill get to that. \n\nIt sounds to me like you have a different interpretation of your relationship with them than they have. I feel like you are thinking of them as a core friend group while they think of it like a group for this music. Its not particularly weird for people to say \"I'll come for pres but not the venue\" when you invite them for your birthday if the venue is not one that they like, unless they are tight friends and even then it depends on how much they dislike the venue. They are presumably assuming you have other people coming, do you? \n\nThe camping trip does seem a little excessive. Do they know that the reason you wanted the other places was for accessibility? Did they give any reason why they selected this location?", "I am going to say NAH but you are being a bit unreasonable. \n\nIf this was a group of people you were friends with outside of this one specific interest... then it would be different. But this group meets to go to that club.", "NAH though I am leaning y.t.a because the group formed around a specific interest and with a shared past that you are trying to change in ways that interest you but dont apparently interest the others. \n\nYour disability is a bit of a red herring and has very little to do with the group. You want to change the groups main focus as well as their shared past to accomodate you,  but with little indication that you are integral enough to the group to reasonably expect such consideration.\n\nIn other words,  you might consider them friends,  but they seem to consider you an acquaintance. You don't have the standing in the group to demand or even expect such extreme changes.", "NAH you said 95% of them are straight and you wanted to go to a LGBTQ+ place and got mad when they didn\u2019t want to start for the whole thing \n\nThey NTA because obviously they would want to go to places they have been before and if you know they don\u2019t like any other places stop trying to force it onto them.", "YTA, you don\u2019t really get to show up in an established group and demand they change for you. That\u2019s isn\u2019t how that works. There are ways to accommodate yourself in many situations, I say that as someone with a traumatic brain injury and a spinal injury. There are canes you can bring that fold into stools to sit.", "NAH - gently, I think you're misunderstanding the nature of the relationship with this group.   It sounds like they have an established thing in their group and are happy to have you join in, but they're not interested in branching out to your interests.   And they don't have to. \n\nYour status as a LGBTQ+ POC with a disability has nothing to do with anything.  I don't want to say Y T A right now, but you would be if you're trying to push a discrimination narrative and guilt people into reshaping the friendship to something only you are wanting.", "NAH. It would be really nice if they included you more, but most of the group likes those places. What does your best friend say? Can they organize a better event for you since they\u2019re one of the organizers?", "NAH, but I think if your needs are continually not being met by this group of people, they may not be people that value you enough to continue to spend time with. The thing about groups like this is that they bring people with a singular shared interest together, it doesn\u2019t vet for if they\u2019re going to be a good friend for you specifically.\n\nYou\u2019re an adult who is able to make choices for yourself and your well being. Your livelihood is not impacted by the group itself. Would it rock if people were more considerate (the camping example especially; but you don\u2019t seem to have any accessibility issues in two of the locations these folks regularly frequent) Of course. But if is a recurring pattern in this group where you feel uncomfortable or unable to participate in the way you\u2019d like to be able to, you really have three options. One is to continue to try to make changes and possibly face continual disappointment, the second is to have firm boundaries on what you will or won\u2019t participate in with the group, and the third is to disconnect entirely. You have a friend in the leader of this group, maybe you can start a separate meet up that feels more accommodating to the needs and wants you have. \n\nBut the reality is here that this is a social group that is a fully elective experience that outside of the meetup you have little ties to - if it were a workplace or a group of friends you\u2019ve known since grade school, that\u2019s one thing; but the thing about being an adult is also being an advocate for self-protection in situations like this.", "NAH It seems like the real issue here is that the group is built around common interests/tastes that you don't fully share and I can't say they're wrong for wanting to go to the place that accommodates those tastes. Since (according to your writing), only one of these people was your pre-existing close friend, I think it's probably more a case of you simply being the odd one out than anything and the group is more about doing what they do than hanging out with you.\n\nYou're also not wrong for saying that doesn't work for you and you don't want to spend time doing something you don't enjoy.\n\nIt just means you probably need a new circle of friends who are more on the same page as you.", "YTA - i'm not sure why you decided this is your personal friend group? It seems to be a group that congregates in order to do these specific activities.", "YTA.  Bring a folding chair.  Tell the manager you need a chair.  It's your disability, find a solution that doesn't require everyone you know to change their plans.\n\nThis is a group of friends doing what they enjoy.  The world doesn't revolve around you.  Grow up.  Get new friends.", "YTA, you don't get to dictate where an already established group of friends do. \n\nThey probably disinclude you for more reason than your disability, race or sexual orientation.\n\nMost likely because you're the type of person no-one wants to be around.", "Babe, get some queer friends. If there is not a queer disabled meetup group there definitely are on other platforms. It is incredibly tiring to be part of a group that doesn't consider your needs, and I feel confident you will find that in other groups. \n\nI think some people in the comments section need to look at the difference between medical and social mobility. It is everyone's responsibility to consider the access and inclusion of disabled people. Yes disabled people have disabilities - but it is society that compounds this by disabling their access to being included in society. \n\nFor example if my friend wants to get a train to see me she has to call the station well in advance to ensure there will be staff to help her, and even when she does this she is often let down. This is such a basic one, but imagine one of your family members is ill and you want to jump on a train immediately to go and see them, my friend simply can't do that. No last minute trips, can't try that new restaurant because there's no ramp, can't go to that pub because the loo is inaccessible. \n\nWhat OP is hearing from their friends is that they don't matter, that they are not important enough to be included in the trip, and that sucks balls for anyone.", "INFO: Have you told them the reason you want to go to these places is because of your disability?", "It's on you to figure out how to deal with your new disability, not everyone else.\n\n>but I resent having to go there now.\n\nYou don't \"have\" to go there, nobody is forcing you to.\n\nThey still agreed to go for pre drinks at the place you chose, don't you have any other friends that could stay or is this meetup group the only friends you have?\n\nDoesn't sound like LGBT+POC thing has anything to do with it and you are just using that to get people to judge in your favor, and I say this as a bisexual metis man. They agreed to go to the LGBT club, doesn't sound like they made a fuss about it, they just don't want to stay there, don't you have any actual real friends outside of this special interest meetup group that could stay or is this meetup group the only acquaintances you have?\n\nI just have to ask about this;\n\n>I\u2019m friends with a group of people that I met through a Meetup group. My best friend is one of the organisers, it\u2019s for people who love the same music. I do like that music, but it\u2019s not my only interest or my whole personality.\n\nWhy the hell did you even join a special interest group if you are not as into that interest in the first place? The group is specifically for people who LOVE a certain type of music and you said you only LIKE said music, but you do not love it like the others do, so why are you even part of the group?\n\nThis is clearly a special interest music group, and you are mistaking it for a close friend group. That is your mistake. They do not owe you anything.\n\nI was gonna go with NAH, but the more I read this the worse you sound.\n\nAgain, this is not a core group of close friends, it is a special interest group, so yes you are clearly overthinking this and thinking of this group as something more than it truly is.\n\nYTA.", "You sound exhausting !

It would be not the asshole if you guys were all friends first, but their interest is clearly the music and, apparently, one particular club. \n\nI think you need to seek friendships with people who are inclusive and would not bristle at going to a queer bar.
