Think loud, bright, temperamental, cheap, shitty gifts that the kids would love but the parents would hate, or something that the parents would have to confiscate from the children that would cause conflict in the family. \n\nFor example if their kids were toddler age, buy them non washable crayons or felt tip pens. Since their kids are 7 and 9, if they like play fighting you could get them something like noisy cheap light sabers that make sounds when they fight. Or water guns, or paint sets. Anything that is messy or noisy or would otherwise cause a headache for their parents.\n\nAnd then sit back and eat your popcorn.", "Buy their kids some cheap thing-so they have something colorful and fun to unwrap. Your beef isn\u2019t with *them*. \n\nNTA the parents sound awful.", "NTA\n\n\nI can't see a reason why you would buy them anyway. Doesn't sound like you're close. Hell, I have cousins that I AM close to and we've never exchanged gifts.", "NTA, but a tough one. You are under no obligations here. Having said that, my dad is an asshole and my family could have shunned me and my siblings because of him. Thankfully they didn't. I try to remember that when dealing with my brother's kids because he is just like our dad....it's not their fault, seeing positive family interactions is really critical for them and they may need us when they realize what their dad is really like.", "Hi, I'm petty, I'd buy something cheap and lame for their kid, the same way they do for yours. But I'd also gift your own kids something really nice to open in front of them every year too. Better yet. Kids don't really care about their quality of gifts at a young age unless they have something to directly compare it to. \n\nFor instance, as a kid, I was super excited to get $50 from my grandpa each Christmas. That was a big deal. But then I found out my cousin's were getting $200 from the same grandpa (because their other grandpa also gave them $200 and our shared grampa didn't want to get shown up. So my cousins would leave with $400 each where we'd have $50.

Good luck to you all. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but you could always go the other way. There's an old proverb that states \"if your neighbor should offend you, buy their child a drum.\"", "NTA for how you feel, but consider this... You're punishing the kids because of their parents behavior.  Your money, your choice.", "I'm going against the crowd on this, but YTA\n\nWhat do the kids have to do with anything here?  Why are you bringing them into this conflict with their AH parents?  My parents and I don't get along with one of my aunts, but we all still get along with her kids (my cousins).\n\nYour aunt and uncle are Tier-1 Assholes, but their kids are just kids dealing with asshole parents.

I believe in being reciprocal when feasible & practical, so if they buy you shit (in terms of quality), you could probably do the same for them. However if you don't want too, nothing is forcing you to. You could test the waters and not buy them anything, and see if the shit gifts from them keep on' coming, because from where I'm standing - they didn't appear to appreciate your efforts when you babysat for them, so giving them anymore (both mentally and materialistically) than needed isn't advised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You're not required to buy anyone anything. It's YOUR paycheck, not anyone else's. Gifts are supposed to be a kind gesture, not a requirement. Many parents now days have a lot of entitlement when it comes to them and their kids. You do whatever you want to do! :)\n\nMy BIL got angry at me for not buying my BIL's kid a Christmas present when I'm a broke college student with a full time job and a mortgage payment. I told them I couldn't afford it and that was that.", "NTA takes more than one person to cooperate. \n\nYou are also not obligated to be there. Take your family on a holiday trip instead. Go rent a cabin over Christmas and do less gifts all together. Go choose happiness instead of stress. Tell them not to buy you anything and you're not buying anyone anything. No one needs more useless crap floating around that they won't get rid of because 'it was a gift'.", "NTA\n\nSo many many years ago a friend of my parents gifted my little sister a baby doll, it kept crying nonstop all day every day, and sometimes in the rare occasions it would shout up on, if you touched it, it will start singing with a very horrible voice, this doll drove me insane, it drove my parents insane, I very much wanted to set this cursed thing on fire and I'm pretty sure my parents shared the desire, only problem is, my sister loved it! She would treat it like a living baby and would scream at anyone for merely not holding it the correct way.\nI don't remember how exatly we got rid of it at the time but the comments reminded me of the incident, and it made me wonder if that friend actually had a grudge against my parents.\n\nSo anyway, to anyone doubting a gift to be a good revenge idea, you're very wrong, it can be literal torture, an absolute nightmare if you picked your weapons right.\nI recommend a crying baby doll.", "NTA - you don't like them so don't buy the presents. Also, I think they are currently NC with you so they won't even notice - so buy you or your child something nice instead.", "Time to organize a gift exchange with just the kids. Cuts back on the overall requirement and you can arrange things so that you draw someone else as your giftee.\n\nOtherwise yes, you can opt out but you would have to opt your own kid out as well. So go with: let\u2019s not exchange gifts between kids at all this year. But if your family is like mine that\u2019s probably a harder sell than gift exchange as a first step.", "NTA- But I'm with the noisy toys suggestion. For is it not written 'if thine enemy offends thee, buy his child a drum'?", "NTA but I agree with other people that you're letting a golden opportunity slip through your fingers. I would seriously buy those children the most annoying, loud, messy gifts I could find. Slime and make your own slime kits, musical instruments like the harmonica, mini drum sets, anything that makes a huge mess. Lots of candy too. There's really disgusting Flavored bottles of pop (soda) out there. Go all out. Be creative. Anything with bells and whistles, anything that requires batteries and give them plenty of batteries.", "yes, why not just buy a new hobby for the children, they are the perfect age to learn an instrument. With us in Belgium you can sometimes buy a trumpet or drum set very cheaply. and of course the pleasure that they will enjoy it for months to come", "Get them a cheap, loud toy that they\u2019d both want to play with, but only get one!\n\nStraight up NTA", "NTA but i would get them cheap, loud things.

Anything with a lot of small pieces!", "Yes! Or super messy like slime making kits with lots of glitter.", "The pop guns. The ones that are the pull and load, not the cap guns with the little smoke pelts, because the pop guns never break no batteries and are loud. Also sling shots. My sibling in law sent music instrumentals thus declaring open season on terrible toys.... She called for a truce after two years.", "I love that idea - my best friend once wanted me to buy her son (he was three at that time) a wooden xylophone. Problem was that the second last musical note was terribly out of tune (the xylophone should have been on C major scale). That xylophone was terribly annoying when he would play on it. I'm so glad my friend wasn't mad at me because I got him what they wanted me to. But looking back, it would be the perfect gift for these cousins.", "Better yet, buy the kids annoying gifts, like a drum set and a xylophone", "Yeah that's sort of how I felt, thank you. It's not their fault their parents and I don't get along.", "Toy trumpets or even (if you want to go nuclear) a pair of vuvuzelas.", "one of those plastic records or harmonica", "This is just so petty, and I love it!!", "Yes! Anything that takes a long time to clean up! Stuff with glitter or sparkles too!", "Oooh, yes! But even better, a dollar store whistle or maybe a plastic recorder flute thing, (going with the  low price *and* noisy theme).", "I like what another commenter suggested - buy the kids something reasonably priced and that they will enjoy...and that will annoy the crap out of their parents.   As the kids do whatever they want, it is practically  guaranteed to work \ud83d\ude08", "Soo many opportunities here.  You can buy them a whistle, cheap and very annoying.  Or you can go all out and buy them the most awful loud obnoxious thing, a drum set and electric guitar with an amplifier. \n\nOf course, you are NTA if you buy nothing, but also awful for parents, an easy bake oven.  A full art set with nothing washable, etc.", "Buy them the same quality presents that they've bought for you and your kid. Ideally something that requires batteries and makes a lot of noise.", "Vuvuzelas? That is so vicious it wins the prize of evil of the day!", "slide whistles are loud and make the same 2 sounds over and over again.", "better, make sure the batteries are rechargeable and teach the kids how to use the charger, so parents can't just let the battery die.", "Don't know why but I've been laughing at this response for 15 minutes. \ud83d\ude02"]}
