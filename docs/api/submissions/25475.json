Still renting.", "so what was the downvote for then", "NTA, you tried over and over and over and they still insist on talking about your finances publicly.  Your salary is none of their business.", "In light of the circumstances I'm going to say NTA.  After all, they opened the can of worms first by negatively comparing you to someone else who earns more for similar work.  That's nobody's business but your own.  Strictly speaking, the same goes for your parents' situation but, like I said, they breached the topic first  so it's now fair game.", "Cut and dry NTA.", "They kept pushing and pushing and pushing.  You pushed back once with the truth.  HOW DARE YOU?   Enjoy the silence.  Turn your phone OFF to the other relatives who are telling you what to do.  MYOFB", "Since you had repeatedly asked them privately to knock if off and they didn't NTA.  And I do think the people in the comments here saying they probably want to mooch off you so they can retire are 100% right.  They figure if they can push you into a better-paying job they'll be able to have you subsidize their retirement.", "NTA. I thought this was going to be a story where they started pressuring you to give them money. I can\u2019t see why your money is any of their business.", "Nta", "NTA. Your parents bullied you and couldnt handle your comeback. Totally on them.", "NTA - While airing someone else's dirty laundry is usually not a good thing to do, they belittled your healthy and stable lifestyle. I'm honestly more concerned on why they are so dead set on you earning more money though. I wouldn't be surprised if they are banking on you being their \"get out of jail\" free card when it comes to their debts and are just poorly attempting to guilt trip you into a higher paying job so you can cover their ass because *family*.", ">With my ability and enormous experience I could find jobs that would pay 3x more.\r\n\nListen, if I could just give you some advice you didn't ask for...I was very much in the same position as you. I had a very comfy job, and very stable financial security but it wasn't enough for my parents. They insisted I could find something better. I hated it so much how my job and salary was never good enough for them when I was doing perfectly fine.\n\nWhen covid hit I jumped on the over hiring and found a job that paid a lot more and honestly...my parents were right. Sure I was saving before but now I was saving more and that \"more\" is just so...liberating. I really think you should at least try and view this advice from other perspectives.", "NTA\n\nThey started it", "NTA\n\nThey started it", "NTA\nI kind of get the feeling they want you to get a higher paying job so you can give the extra to them.", "If they deserved it, it was not to much. If people don't know when to shut up h my their own business that is not on  you. NTA", "I get the feeling that they aren\u2019t so much worried about you, but would prefer you make more money so you could take care of them. They know you are living comfortably and debt free, any \u201cextra\u201d money would \u201chelp\u201d them retire.", "NTA. I suspect they want you to earn more so they can ask you for money. Maybe after this incident, they will both leave you alone.", "Well, to be fair, they are the ones bringing up the subject of money after you have told them multiple times that you are content with your income and your work/life balance. \n\nIs it that they want you to supplement their reduced retirement that they are so adament that you need to earn more? \n\nNTA", "This is the way", "Yes, ESH. Parents are out of line and OP needs to learn to set a boundary, shut down a conversation on a topic they don\u2019t want to talk about **without resorting to the exact same behavior as their parents**", "This exactly, work/life balance is more important than money, and if you are able to choose between the two, who wouldn't choose less stress or more freedom?  Understandably a lot of people aren't in that position, so they don't understand why people don't work for more money when they can.  In 2010 I quit a job two years in, making 85k after previously making 45k.  I was suddenly unemployed and worked part time for a year before continuing on with my career after taking the time off to get a masters degree.  Never looked back and am happier how than I'm are I would have been had I stuck it out and had more money in the bank.", "This feels closer to the truth. OP's got some narcisccistic parentage going on over there.", "NTA \nBut you shouldn\u2019t have done that. I get why you did - but just cos they suck doesn\u2019t mean you need to resort to their tactics\n\nI\u2019ll get downvoted for my opinion on it for sure.", "NTA They might just want you to make more so they can ask for it.", "NTA they weren't worrying for you, they were harassing you in public.", "NTA. Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'.", "ESH.\n\nNot cool, toxic family, not cool.", "ESH, not their business about how much you get paid, but OP was spiteful with their comment. But I'm actually wondering if maybe the parents of OP are concerned that they are being taken advantage of at their job, since the cousin came in as a new hire and is instantly being paid more? Or they don't want OP to be in a similar position to them when it comes retirement time.", "NTA. Sounds like your parents want you to make more so you can pay off their debts.", "NTA  \nYou asked them to let it go.  \nThey chose not to.", "NTA, but the better reaction would have been to leave when they start harping on your earnings.  You don\u2019t always have to fight back or say something back, even if they deserve it.  Leaving, just leaving, not saying anything, just leaving is pretty powerful.", "NTA. They\u2019re not worried about you. They want you to earn more so that you become their retirement plan. They just want to mooch. But being happy with your life is worth so much more than a high paying job.\n\n Im in a similar situation. Im basically just getting by. I cant afford to splurge on stuff. Bills take up most of my income now. But Im slowly paying off my mortgage, car payments, etc. And I enjoy my job\u2026 or at least, I dont dread going into work every day. Im sure I could find a higher paying job, but I know most other jobs in my industry would just cause me a lot of anxiety. And being able to enjoy life is so much more important.", "NTA. They shouldn't be dishing it out if they can't take it. \n\nAlso they probably want you to make more money so you'll give them some. Probably best to distance yourself.", "that's exactly what they did", "Parents want OP to make more money so they can help them pay off those debts. OP needs to keep doing what they are doing and never let the parents know how much is in savings.", "NTA", "ESH. No, it's not cool that they want to criticize you openly for your career choice, even though you are doing well and are financially stable. However, you also chose to stoop to their level when you decided to embarrass them publicly. \n\nIf you really wanted to say that, you could have said it in private.", "No kidding. I could make double what I make now if I dropped close to a month of vacation time, got worse insurance, and took a job I hated/would destroy my body. Not going to lie, the extra month of vacation time over average is worth it to me. But my wife and I have a house, are comfortable, and live healthily. More money isn't going to make things better.", "Same.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nTell the family: You were just trying to reassure your parents that you don't have the burden of irresponsible debts like they do, so they needn't worry about you at all and focus on managing the debt burden they need to get out from.", "NTA.  It\u2019s fine for them to risk embarrassing you but returning the favor is going too far?  No, they opened themselves up for that one.", "NTA\nU like your stress free job, which is good. Your parents maybe thinking that if you earned more you'd be able to help them out cash wise. Why else are they on you so much to earn more if they're not looking for money from you? You spoke to them both together and separately and they're not stopping with the comparisons. Hope they stop now that's it's known that they're in debt still", "NTA. Your parents need to learn that if they don't start any crap, there won't be any crap. They're probably embarrassed because they have been covering up their circumstances and you exposed their lies in an effort to defend yourself. You're happy, they should be content with that."]}
