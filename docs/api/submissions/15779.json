Last July she got engaged and had a date set for July 2023. I was asked to be in her bridal party to which I agreed. I then got engaged this past December and later set my date for mid-July. When I set my date I was aware that her wedding was July 1. I am starting nursing school in August and wanted to make sure I was able to get married before then.\n\nI called my cousin to let her know my wedding would be a couple of weeks after hers this coming July. She then became frustrated with me that I set my wedding so close to hers when she was engaged first. I explained that she would be back from her honeymoon before my wedding weekend and I would make sure my bachelorette party and bridal shower would not get in the way of hers.\n\nShe then said we had nothing left to talk about and hung up. My cousin then tells our whole family about the issue at hand. Everyone takes sides and our family is now split on who is right.\n\nShe then calls me a couple of days later to tell me it was best I am not a part of her bridal party. I was not invited to her bridal shower along with being uninvited from her bachelorette party which I was helping plan. My sisters and mom were also not invited to the bridal shower for her. We did get a wedding invite but have not RSVP'd yet.\n\nAm I the asshole?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit (info): We and our families all live in the same area and our weddings are close in location. There are no travel expenses for our family that we share. I also did not want to plan my wedding before hers to ensure I wasn't taking away from her big day leading up. I start school in early August.\n\nedit 2: since I am catholic I cannot get married at the courthouse, I would need to get married in a catholic church.

It's fine, and it will all work out, but two wedding in one pay period, two travel events so close together, all that will impact her wedding.  It just will.  Doesn't make you an asshole but I wouldn't be thrilled either.  As a guest or the other bride.", "NTA. Sounds like you went out of your way to make sure everything for yours would be after hers and them back from her honeymoon. She\u2019s gets a day for her wedding, not the entire month. While I wouldn\u2019t personally do it, I understand why you want to do it before school starts. She\u2019s being pretty petty and vindictive over it too. She sounds a bit immature honestly to be getting married if she un-invited you and your family from all wedding events. She\u2019s throwing a bridezilla tantrum", "NTA. You didn't plan the wedding before hers. You carefully organized it so she could be at all your events with no conflict. She's just being irrational and the AH for kicking you out of her bridal party.", "nta. The world doesn't revolve around your cousin. You guys aren't in elementary school, you can't call 'firsties'. Just cuz she was engaged first and set her wedding date first, doesn't mean she gets to tell other when they can have their nuptials. Yes, it would be better if you did it later, or maybe a bit sooner, but you tried to be considerate and told her you'd work around her dates. \n\nUninviting you to the bridal shower is one thing, but to do the same to your mom and sister is way too much.\n\nI would not go to her wedding.", "You\u2019re planning a big Catholic wedding and reception in less than six months?! I understand wanting to do it before you start school and don\u2019t want to have your attention split with wedding planning, but a lot of vendors are booked for the year. Have you considered having it a year from now during your summer break? \n\nNAH, but you should have talked with her when you saw how close your dates were going to be.", "Your cousin has lost her mind. Ask each relative, in person, if they would really expect you to not get married before starting nursing school just because your cousin was freshly back from her honeymoon. Then ignore them and enjoy your wedding. (Probably best that you aren't in the wedding party- she's gonna bridezilla it up.) NTA", "NTA. Your cousin is too young to be married. I don\u2019t mean her chronological age. She\u2019s showing her immaturity with this diva behavior. Especially given the added info that none of your shared guests need to travel far, it\u2019s just silly.\n\nAlso \u2014 my friend and her cousin got married one week after the other on purpose! They are both Desi-American and had family traveling from India. It made things so much easier on their families and in terms of expenses. I attended the second wedding (my friend\u2019s) and it was a blast. Families can make this work when they love each other.", "This is the logical extension of the \"birthday week\" -- the \"wedding year.\" Yikes. \n\nYou do you. She's being immature. Rise above and have a great wedding. Go. Give her a lovely gift. Gush over what a lovely event it is and how radiant she looks. Then enjoy your day and bask in the love of all the people who come for you.", "NTA. What is it with some brides that acted like the whole year belongs to them?? Is a whole day all about you not enough? Holy moly. And then to involve the whole family in the drama. Your cousin is a drama queen.", "NTA. She gets her day. You get your day. This idea that a wedding is a month-long or even year-long event is ridiculous. For 99% of the guests, it's a day or two, then back to normal life.\n\nI see some people comment that it will be hard for guests traveling, but it sounds like that's not really an issue for your overlapping guests. Then there's the question of guests affording gifts. That could be legitimate, depending on the family. I guess you both have to be prepared to get less stuff, and your cousin can always change her date if her big concern is just how much she's cashing in. She doesn't get to dictate the timing of your life events for her big payday. And she doesn't own the month of July.\n\nCongrats, and I hope you have a wonderful wedding!", "NTA. \n\nBridezilla thinks she owns the month of July. You can get married whenever you want.", "NTA- she is the a-hole. who cares that she was engaged first? you have been with your s/o longer than she has been with hers, so realistically you should have gotten engaged before her. not your fault her boyfriend wanted to propose after 3 dates (exaggerating i know). she sounds extremely self centered. and any person in your guys\u2019 family who isn\u2019t taking your side are probably self centered people too", "INFO: Are you doing a big wedding? Are there people who would be travelling long-distance for both weddings? If the answer to both questions is yes, YTA full stop, honestly.\n\nUsually with these kinds of posts I say NTA it's your wedding, but *2 weeks?* Come on. If your wedding is a small courthouse type of thing then sure, have it whenever you want, but if you're going for a full wedding/reception/etc and a lot of the same people will be going to both weddings it's going to be very difficult for them and they'll probably have to choose which one to attend.\n\nYour cousin probably thinks that a lot of people are going to be talking about your upcoming wedding at hers, and honestly she's not that wrong. If you want to be legally married do it whenever you want, but don't have a huge ceremony 2 weeks after your cousin's who you're close to, that's just tacky.", "NTA, you want to be settled into married life before you start school.  RSVP yes, this does not mean you have to attend (or give a gift).  As for kicking you out of a party you were planning to honor her anything in your name cancel ASAP.  Get what refund you can and do not just let them take over the reservations.", "NTA.  As long as you announced this at the beginning of the year, since your family all live in the same area, they have had plenty of time to organise outfits and gifts if they are giving them and travel does not appear to be an issue.  A wedding is for one day, not for a whole month or year.  \n\nHaving said that, 2 weeks is a little close - they will be talking about your wedding at hers, on the other hand she will be talking about her honeymoon at yours......if her issue is about gifts, then that does not reflect well on her really.  \n\nOnly the bride and groom and maybe their parents think about this wedding all the time - everyone else only thinks about it when picking clothes, buying a gift and showing up.  The rest of the time they are NOT thinking about your wedding.  Your cousin is deluding herself if she thinks everyone else is as fixated on her wedding as she is.", "If you wanted to be married (not specifically have the wedding) why couldn't you go to the courthouse first before August?  \n\nThen you'd have time to plan a wedding later.  \n\nGoing NAH but I can see where someone would think you're trying to compete.  You look like you're trying to be an AH even though you aren't.  \n\nAre you concerned about having the wedding before August or do you need to be married for paperwork reasons before August?", "NTA, people\u2019s expectations you put off life events for theirs are so utterly bizarre. Finding a weekend that works with your life and venue is hard af.", "NTA, it's called \"wedding season\" for a reason.", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing but this sorta thing happens in my country all the time. I really don\u2019t see what the big deal is. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s being held two days apart", "NTA\n\nI guess I\u2019d understand her anger if your wedding was the day before or after her wedding (given how a honeymoon, If there was one, could mean one or the other wouldn\u2019t be able to go to eachothers wedding) but yours is a few weeks after.\n\nThe entire month or year doesn\u2019t belong to them, you\u2019re allowed to get married in the same month as someone else.", "YTA - two weddings in such a close proximity, that is going to be a drain on all the relatives who want to attend both. \n\nYes, it\u2019s \u201cyour day\u201d but the close proximity may make it hard on people, having to take time off, arranging transportation, lodging, etc. \n\nA little more the two weeks in between would have been nice.", "NTA buuuuut if I was a relative I would feel a little busy and pressured. Attending a wedding can be a bit much if you consider 2 different wedding outfits, 2 different wedding gifts, and idk if both of you are planning on an engagement party and such. I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to pull two weddings in a months time.", "YTA. There\u2019s no reason to have your wedding so close to hers. And you both seem to be viewing this as some kind of competition. You know you have to be married to these guys after the wedding, right?", "NTA\n\nOne summer, two of my brothers and two of my cousins got married. The weddings were spread over three states and four months. It was a bit if a marathon, but it was fun to see so many relatives so often\u2014as my cousins and siblings have gotten older, lots of them have moved away, so weddings are like mini-family reunions.\n\nEven when my brother got married two weeks after my cousin, 600 miles from the area where most of the family lives, people cheerfully made the trek. \n\nOne of my aunts was sad at the last wedding; she\u2019d been having a lot of fun seeing everyone. And maybe the open cars played into that a little bit.\n\nOne cousin caught the bouquet at three of the weddings. She was engaged at the last one!", "I think so YTA. I believe you should have asked, or even told your cousin, before you set the date, gauged her reaction, and decided accordingly. I happen to agree with your cousin.", "YTA\n\nTwo weeks is not long at all and there is always a financial (and mental!) burden for weddings, which means that your families are going to suddenly be thinking about managing that. I'm not into weddings at all, but I know it's so important for a lot people, so this just seems like a crappy thing to do.", "NTA - But you are naive to think there would be no repercussions. You are both going to bleed the same group of families of their money and time without letting them time to recover. \n\nHopefully, she'll get the good gifts and you will get the leftovers.", "Complete asshole move, you are the asshole.

It's hard to plan a wedding when you are in nursing school that is very demanding upon your time, concentration, and studying.", "Why.  Please explain.", "Being invited to multiple weddings at the time  means more expense (clothes, wedding gifts) and childcare scheduling. Some people definitely find it to be a hassle. Being in a wedding and traveling to another wedding a week later is difficult. Some family or mutual friends will need to pick one bachelorette weekend to go to because two trips is very expensive. Certain jobs make it hard to get time off and not everyone has unlimited PTO.\n\nIt's good you are happy but there are reasons why people try to give each other space with a wedding dates already on the calendar. I recently got engaged and I am being courteous to folks who already picked a date out before me, this is especially something to be considerate of when you are at an age in your life when many of your friends/family are getting married and people start having their first kids. I'm 33 right now this is definitely something not unique to me.", "We want to get married so that we can live together.
