Last July she got engaged and had a date set for July 2023. I was asked to be in her bridal party to which I agreed. I then got engaged this past December and later set my date for mid-July. When I set my date I was aware that her wedding was July 1. I am starting nursing school in August and wanted to make sure I was able to get married before then.\n\nI called my cousin to let her know my wedding would be a couple of weeks after hers this coming July. She then became frustrated with me that I set my wedding so close to hers when she was engaged first. I explained that she would be back from her honeymoon before my wedding weekend and I would make sure my bachelorette party and bridal shower would not get in the way of hers.\n\nShe then said we had nothing left to talk about and hung up. My cousin then tells our whole family about the issue at hand. Everyone takes sides and our family is now split on who is right.\n\nShe then calls me a couple of days later to tell me it was best I am not a part of her bridal party. I was not invited to her bridal shower along with being uninvited from her bachelorette party which I was helping plan. My sisters and mom were also not invited to the bridal shower for her. We did get a wedding invite but have not RSVP'd yet.\n\nAm I the asshole?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit (info): We and our families all live in the same area and our weddings are close in location.

Doesn't make you an asshole but I wouldn't be thrilled either.  As a guest or the other bride.", "NTA. Sounds like you went out of your way to make sure everything for yours would be after hers and them back from her honeymoon. She\u2019s gets a day for her wedding, not the entire month. While I wouldn\u2019t personally do it, I understand why you want to do it before school starts. She\u2019s being pretty petty and vindictive over it too. She sounds a bit immature honestly to be getting married if she un-invited you and your family from all wedding events. She\u2019s throwing a bridezilla tantrum", "NTA. You didn't plan the wedding before hers. You carefully organized it so she could be at all your events with no conflict. She's just being irrational and the AH for kicking you out of her bridal party.", "nta. The world doesn't revolve around your cousin. You guys aren't in elementary school, you can't call 'firsties'. Just cuz she was engaged first and set her wedding date first, doesn't mean she gets to tell other when they can have their nuptials. Yes, it would be better if you did it later, or maybe a bit sooner, but you tried to be considerate and told her you'd work around her dates. \n\nUninviting you to the bridal shower is one thing, but to do the same to your mom and sister is way too much.\n\nI would not go to her wedding.", "You\u2019re planning a big Catholic wedding and reception in less than six months?!

Have you considered having it a year from now during your summer break? \n\nNAH, but you should have talked with her when you saw how close your dates were going to be.", "Your cousin has lost her mind. Ask each relative, in person, if they would really expect you to not get married before starting nursing school just because your cousin was freshly back from her honeymoon. Then ignore them and enjoy your wedding. (Probably best that you aren't in the wedding party- she's gonna bridezilla it up.) NTA", "NTA. Your cousin is too young to be married. I don\u2019t mean her chronological age. She\u2019s showing her immaturity with this diva behavior. Especially given the added info that none of your shared guests need to travel far, it\u2019s just silly.\n\nAlso \u2014 my friend and her cousin got married one week after the other on purpose! They are both Desi-American and had family traveling from India. It made things so much easier on their families and in terms of expenses. I attended the second wedding (my friend\u2019s) and it was a blast. Families can make this work when they love each other.", "This is the logical extension of the \"birthday week\" -- the \"wedding year.\" Yikes. \n\nYou do you. She's being immature.

This idea that a wedding is a month-long or even year-long event is ridiculous. For 99% of the guests, it's a day or two, then back to normal life.\n\nI see some people comment that it will be hard for guests traveling, but it sounds like that's not really an issue for your overlapping guests. Then there's the question of guests affording gifts. That could be legitimate, depending on the family. I guess you both have to be prepared to get less stuff, and your cousin can always change her date if her big concern is just how much she's cashing in. She doesn't get to dictate the timing of your life events for her big payday.

You can get married whenever you want.", "NTA- she is the a-hole. who cares that she was engaged first? you have been with your s/o longer than she has been with hers, so realistically you should have gotten engaged before her. not your fault her boyfriend wanted to propose after 3 dates (exaggerating i know). she sounds extremely self centered. and any person in your guys\u2019 family who isn\u2019t taking your side are probably self centered people too", "INFO: Are you doing a big wedding? Are there people who would be travelling long-distance for both weddings?

If your wedding is a small courthouse type of thing then sure, have it whenever you want, but if you're going for a full wedding/reception/etc and a lot of the same people will be going to both weddings it's going to be very difficult for them and they'll probably have to choose which one to attend.\n\nYour cousin probably thinks that a lot of people are going to be talking about your upcoming wedding at hers, and honestly she's not that wrong. If you want to be legally married do it whenever you want, but don't have a huge ceremony 2 weeks after your cousin's who you're close to, that's just tacky.", "NTA, you want to be settled into married life before you start school.  RSVP yes, this does not mean you have to attend (or give a gift).  As for kicking you out of a party you were planning to honor her anything in your name cancel ASAP.  Get what refund you can and do not just let them take over the reservations.", "NTA.  As long as you announced this at the beginning of the year, since your family all live in the same area, they have had plenty of time to organise outfits and gifts if they are giving them and travel does not appear to be an issue.  A wedding is for one day, not for a whole month or year.  \n\nHaving said that, 2 weeks is a little close - they will be talking about your wedding at hers, on the other hand she will be talking about her honeymoon at yours......if her issue is about gifts, then that does not reflect well on her really.  \n\nOnly the bride and groom and maybe their parents think about this wedding all the time - everyone else only thinks about it when picking clothes, buying a gift and showing up.  The rest of the time they are NOT thinking about your wedding.  Your cousin is deluding herself if she thinks everyone else is as fixated on her wedding as she is.", "If you wanted to be married (not specifically have the wedding) why couldn't you go to the courthouse first before August?  \n\nThen you'd have time to plan a wedding later.  \n\nGoing NAH but I can see where someone would think you're trying to compete.  You look like you're trying to be an AH even though you aren't.  \n\nAre you concerned about having the wedding before August or do you need to be married for paperwork reasons before August?", "NTA, people\u2019s expectations you put off life events for theirs are so utterly bizarre.

Attending a wedding can be a bit much if you consider 2 different wedding outfits, 2 different wedding gifts, and idk if both of you are planning on an engagement party and such. I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to pull two weddings in a months time.", "YTA. There\u2019s no reason to have your wedding so close to hers. And you both seem to be viewing this as some kind of competition. You know you have to be married to these guys after the wedding, right?", "NTA\n\nOne summer, two of my brothers and two of my cousins got married. The weddings were spread over three states and four months. It was a bit if a marathon, but it was fun to see so many relatives so often\u2014as my cousins and siblings have gotten older, lots of them have moved away, so weddings are like mini-family reunions.\n\nEven when my brother got married two weeks after my cousin, 600 miles from the area where most of the family lives, people cheerfully made the trek. \n\nOne of my aunts was sad at the last wedding; she\u2019d been having a lot of fun seeing everyone. And maybe the open cars played into that a little bit.\n\nOne cousin caught the bouquet at three of the weddings. She was engaged at the last one!", "I think so YTA. I believe you should have asked, or even told your cousin, before you set the date, gauged her reaction, and decided accordingly. I happen to agree with your cousin.", "YTA\n\nTwo weeks is not long at all and there is always a financial (and mental!) burden for weddings, which means that your families are going to suddenly be thinking about managing that. I'm not into weddings at all, but I know it's so important for a lot people, so this just seems like a crappy thing to do.", "NTA - But you are naive to think there would be no repercussions.

Being in a wedding and traveling to another wedding a week later is difficult. Some family or mutual friends will need to pick one bachelorette weekend to go to because two trips is very expensive. Certain jobs make it hard to get time off and not everyone has unlimited PTO.\n\nIt's good you are happy but there are reasons why people try to give each other space with a wedding dates already on the calendar.

It is a lot with finding childcare, buying gifts, dressing up, rescheduling their own lives etc for weddings so close together. People left our reception very early to go to that wedding. Our gifts were definitely far less from people going to both. Which was actually totally fine, I'd rather the other couple got more gifts as we were older and more established and didn't need household stuff like they did. But it was noticeable. Plus people then had to buy 2 dressier wedding outfits because they didn't want to appear in both and honestly because ours were same day people felt they had to change between. Even at 2 weeks apart most won't want to be seen in the same outfit. I understand why you want the date you chose but just expect lower attendance and not as much excitement.", "NTA. I dont understand this I guess and something that super similar happened to my husband. My husband used to be pretty close with his cousin. Cousin was engaged for over a year, wedding set for June. We got engaged and I didn\u2019t want to wait a year and a half so we decided to go six months instead. My sister in law could only get certain weekends off with her residency so we were kind of stuck with the weekend after the cousin\u2019s planned wedding. We didn\u2019t necessarily want that day (my long-time pastor wasn\u2019t even available) but we wanted SIL there so we made it work. The cousin refused my husband\u2019s invitation to be a groomsman and they have barely talked since. Everyone had fun at both weddings and I think it was silly to be upset about it. I wouldn\u2019t have been upset but I guess everyone\u2019s different.", "NTA. I got married 3 weeks after one of my cousins.  Our other cousin had a destination wedding in another country the same exact day as mine. None of us got mad at each other. I went to my cousins wedding that was before mine and he went to mine. Not all family members made it to all of our weddings and it was fine.  She needs to get over herself.\n\nAlso, we\u2019re all Catholic and had Catholic weddings. Obviously any family that had to travel from out of state either had to pick a wedding to attend or had to come out twice. I wasn\u2019t upset at any family for choosing to go to another cousins wedding and not mine.", "NTA. One of my close friends had this exact issue this past year- she and her best friend both got engaged and their dates were set a week apart. They were MOHs for each other. You know what they did? They made it fun by taking pics of both of them in their wedding dresses together (outside of the events) and enjoyed toasting each other at every occasion but the main event for each. Heck, the pair of us got engaged within a few weeks of each other and there were no hard feelings- in fact it was super cathartic to have another bride to chat with about planning. \n\nBig life moments are meant to invite happiness from the people you love, not resentment. You don't get to claim a stake on a timeframe for your happiness to trump everyone else's. \n\nIf she continues to be a pain about it, I'd challenge how long she has rule over? 3 weeks? A month? Will she pay to change your venue? Or to reimburse for the classes you're taking that interfere? If you give in here, does that mean you can veto her baby name in the future? Or reserve a due date/month? << That all sounds as ridiculous as she's being. \n\nCongratulations!

Sure, it\u2019s only 30 minutes but weddings are exhausting as fun as they are. Then there\u2019s the gift and money. That\u2019s a lot to ask in one month. I\u2019d do it a month before her at least.", "NTA. You have perfectly valid reasons to get married before school starts. Not only that, you were even thoughtful by scheduling yours afterward. She DEFINITELY overreacted by uninviting you to the wedding and activities leading up to it. \n\nThe fact that she uninvited your mom and sister as well would enrage me to the point that I would reschedule your wedding to take place the weekend IMMEDIATELY before hers. What's she gonna do, uninvite you again?\n\nThe reason for moving yours up would be twofold - first, to see if she would be so petty and spiteful as to move hers just to be before yours, and secondly: to get the better non-registry gifts, lol.\n\nMan, I wish I knew the venue and dates because I would totally pay someone to pull the fire alarm right in the middle of her ceremony...and twice, an hour apart, during the reception.", "OP NTA! Please be prepared for her and your Aunt to compare weddings receptions. If you have planned to have frozen margarita machine she would say your spiteful making everyone forget she had a chocolate fountain, or seat covers, or blow up guitars for the kids  ect...I think your cousin is behaving very childishly. It is ridiculous thinking she is entitled to an entire month because she chose the date first. I am proud of how you handled it OP. You were really thoughtful while taking into account her bridal shower dates and bachelorette party date. I think you will be happier attending her wedding only as a  guest.  Then you can't be blamed if anything went wrong. And a fun tip, at my wedding (catholic too so a lot of kids) we brought kids Juice Boxes for the kids. We saved money not having to pay for all the half finished kids drinks and the kids loved it. We also had play doh and special coloring sheets with markers (washable) and crayons set up at  two designated play tables so all the younger cousins could hange out together and play. I wish you a beautiful wedding and a long loving marriage! \ud83d\udc96\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc95", "I did a traditional Catholic wedding of 100+ people in 6 months, it definitely can be done! Absolutely depends on where you're getting married and what venues are available of course, in a bigger city I could see it being much more difficult (plus I did mine is 2021, in between Covid lockdowns, we didn't break any rules).", "> NTA. I think the stress of a wedding just causes folks to lose it sometimes. Any little change can be the pin that pops the balloon for them.\n\nA lot of seemingly petty blowups are straw that broke the camel's back, hadn't thought of applying that to bridezilla behavior", "The wedding is local to both OP and cousin. None of that stuff is involved.", "In the US we do not truly have separation of church and state so a priest can officially marry you without doing it at the courthouse. I got married in Mexico, super catholic, and the church was just a ceremony. We still had to do the courthouse bc after their revolution, they actually do separate church and state. I\u2019m", "It's generally all it is. Just the pressure to have that \"perfect\" wedding while every friend and relative watches. Not everyone handles it well.", "I\u2019m Catholic. You can get married anywhere, you just don\u2019t want to.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s your wedding, you\u2019re allowed to do it how you want.", "For me OP is the AH not because of bridezilla but the pressure she\u2019s adding to her family and other overlapping guests. Some might need to choose and that\u2019s unfair to put on them. She should just have hers at least a full month before bridezilla", "Right. I got an awesome suit, I wear it to all the occasions. They're just impressed I'm wearing one", "Is it normal where you are for people to get married so young?\n\n21 and 22. Yikes! Why the hurry?", "Why are you all in a rush to get married? You\u2019re 22. She\u2019s been dating someone for a year and got engaged last July \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 after a couple of months of dating. Genuinely don\u2019t get why people are getting married at 21 and 22. Good luck I guess. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to have your wedding whenever you want, but I can kinda see your cousins point. Weddings, even attending as a guest is expensive for new outfits etc, bridal showers, hen parties and all that. That\u2019s a lot of expense for people having to attend 2 weddings in 2 weeks. It does kinda take the shine off hers a little, but as I said you\u2019re entitled to get married whenever you want to.", "You get to get married whenever and wherever you like, but especially if there are family members who are already committed to traveling to your cousin's wedding, you're probably going to lose a bunch of them from your own wedding.

My sister and cousin had a Friday /Sunday wedding break at the same weekend resort over memorial weekend a few years back. 10/10 recommendation.", "NTA, ur cousin is insanely childish", "NTA, she does not own the only right to get married in July. The only thing that it\u2019s tough on is anybody buying gifts/experiences for travel to attend two weddings a couple weeks apart. \n\nJust ignore her. Enjoy your wedding.", "> Why are you all in a rush to get married? \n\nThey're Catholic and their families wouldn't be supportive of them living together with a partner before marriage.

Don't think the fam is going to wear the same clothes to both weddings.", "In lots of countries, you can't have a religious ceremony before you had the legal bit..... you CHOOSE to have a religious ceremony, it's not a must.\n\n\nWe get it, you want to rush getting married so you can live together and have sex, to appease your families.Hopefully you have a plan B in case you and your SO aren't compatible living together.

I really just don't think it's that big a deal. I've been to a fuckton of weddings and wore the same dress to three happening in the same year (with overlapping friend invites). For anyone who really cares, they have a few months to get clothes.\n\nAs for gifts, I'm not sure if it's different for Catholic weddings, but I've definitely had my share of gifting the bride and groom after the wedding. A lot of times, I'll clean up some of the smaller stuff people didn't get off their registry.", "It depends if it\u2019s all the same people or not. As this is two cousins you\u2019re going to have all the same family at both weddings, so it\u2019s nice to have a different outfit for each one so it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re just going to the same wedding twice.\n\nAlso, two weddings can have very different dress codes. If one is a lot more formal than the other the same dress may not be appropriate.\n\nWeekends are quite normal as people move away quite often nowadays so friends spread out and hence would need to travel to be in the same place and therefore stay over. So if most people are travelling it makes sense to make a weekend of it rather than just a day and people have to sort out their own accommodation etc. obviously if every lives in the same city or whatever then a day makes a lot more sense.", "Even if you wear something you already own you\u2019ve still got to come up with 2 gifts and these days everyone expects cash for their wishing well", "Holy shiiiite that\u2019s a good bible spoof", "Same people or not 1fancy outfit.

She kicked you out of her bridal party, she uninvited you from all of the pre wedding celebrations, and she also kicked out your mother and sister who did nothing to her just because she's mad at you.\n\nShe isn't mature enough to be married. Tell her you'll see her at her next wedding, RSVP no to this one since she clearly doesn't want you there if she isn't the center of your world as well as her own.\n\nEnjoy your wedding!

Here bachelorette parties are like a dinner lol. When it comes to clothes, for women, it might look bad to wear the same thing for two weddings so close together with common guests. I usually feel these rules are silly but I must admit I would be embarassed. I've had to buy new clothes and shoes for weddings because I just don't usually wear formal dresses or shoes, but now that I have some yeah it's not needed.", "My point is you don't know everyone's circumstances or finances and planning a wedding back to back on purpose with a lot of the same invitees means some of them might not be able to fully participate in some capacity for both events.

A suit as opposed to what?", "Or the Midwest/south of USA.", "Their has one nice outfit and do not need another.", "It's okay you think that way and it's okay other people do not. Clothes are not the most expensive thing about going to a wedding.

What is the problem with having two weddings back to back? More cake! Less dress-shoping for the guests!", "Make you change the seating plans at least. Give people a chance for people to talk to someone else at the dinner table.\n\nHave fun!", "I guess I'm missing something here as to why she's mad.  Getting booted from the parties and such wouldn't concern me much, decline the wedding invite and don't invite her to your wedding.  NTAH.", "YTA, mostly towards your guests. Having to attend two weddings in one month is not fun. Two outfits, two wedding gifts, childcare for two weekends etc.\n\nThere's more than a month between your set date and beginning of your studies. Why you have to have your wedding in the same month as your cousin? What if someone can't make it to both weddings and chooses yours over hers?", "NTA.  There\u2019s only so many weeks in the summer (prime wedding season due to school being out).  Heck, if I had to avoid cousin\u2019s events by several weeks I\u2019s never get anything done (my dad is 1 of 9 so lot\u2019s of cousins).", "The fact that she also is taking her anger out on OPs sister and mum shows me that she is an entitled woman.

One of the girls bought a new dress and wore it to every one.  She absolutely won that summer.\n\nAnd it was a cute dress to!", "some of it is things like photos. two cousins means there will be family photos at both weddings- so if people are rewearing outfits, outside of the bridal parties- it may be difficult to tell is this photo of Uncle Arnold climbing a tree after Cousin Bart from Cousin Carol's wedding or Cousin Denise's wedding, if everyone is wearing essentially the same thing.\n\nit's less a deal for general guests where you are less likely to have overlap.", "Exactly, I've seen people show up to weddings in jeans and a t shirt.

I didn't even use ChatGPT \ud83d\ude05.", "As opposed to not wearing a suit. \n\nThis is obviously a guy who generally wears casual clothes and it\u2019s extremely unusual to see him in an actual formal suit.", "Did you read what I wrote after that. Yes, I wouldn't judge anyone but I would feel insecure about it. What, are you going to police my feelings about it?", "Thank you for saying what I was thinking...", "Bold of you to assume he wears clothes.....", "There\u2019s no law that says you can\u2019t reuse an outfit for multiple weddings.
