Because babies cry and you cannot play with newborns and they sleep a lot. So that is not very fun for a 6 year old. And of course there are a lot of changes and the daughter is having to share all the attention. So that is difficult. You have to give a 6 year old some space to work through ALL those emotions. I recently had a baby and his brother feels a lot of emotions (excited, scared, annoyed). Pushing excitement as a mother is making sure the 6 year old will probably want nothing to do with the baby in the beginning.

It's a generational problem, and I'm definitely not the only person who was burnt by the 'it's your job to take care of your siblings' rhetoric. \n\nThe PARENTS are responsible for their children. The sibling is responsible to be a sibling, not teach or take care of the child they didn't even consent to have around.", "Not once did op state that OPs child needs to take care of their new sibling, also there is nothing wrong with being a good and responsible role model for your younger sibling.", ">reminded her that she\u2019ll have to teach the baby how to be a good kid and that\u2019s a big job", "That\u2019s not taking care/raising them.

This is textbook perfect parenting of a young child - validate feelings, redirect expectations, get them excited about it and let them enjoy it on their own terms. There is virtually no way a 6-year-old won't be super happy to see and play with a new baby unless J is doing such a bad job of caring for her that your child associates the new baby with neglect. in that case you need to have a long sitdown with J, because J is going to soon start pushing you to focus on your \"real\" family instead of your \"old family\".", "I was *not* excited about the baby my parents had when I was 3 (and 9 months).  A lot of kids who are only children aren't excited for a little sibling! NTA.\n\nMy brother and I get along fine as adults, by the by.", "NTA. Even in the best circumstances little kids have mixed feelings about new siblings. Parents have to deal honestly with the kids, and trying to tell her \"of course you're excited!\" or otherwise giving her the idea that she shouldn't feel how she feels is wrong, wrong, wrong. \n\nTry communicating with your ex, even if you have to do it by email. Tell her what your daughter told you. Tell her that she's feeling replaced and that you have to work together to make sure she's OK and to minimize sibling rivalry. That last will mostly impact your ex's life, but you'll have some fallout from that rivalry, too.\n\nMy middle child was 2 1/2 when my youngest was born. He was looking forward to a sibling, but when the reality of life with a newborn hit, he asked \"What's it good for?\"", "NTA", "I feel like the comments aren\u2019t actually taking the fact that there\u2019s more than one perspective here into account.\n\nWith your perspective where we actually know what you said to your daughter, your ex seems like shes massively overreacting. You definitely explained it in an appropriate way and did what you could to help your daughter process the changes. You also assured her that everyone still loves her just as much as they did before despite a new baby on the way. You were responding to concerns she had in realistic and helpful ways. Genuinely, that was 10/10 parenting. As a dad, you did amazingly here. As a coparent, you probably should have called or texted her that night to let her know about the convo you and daughter just had as it was very predictable that she would immediately tell her mom about it.\n\nYour ex did not know how this conversation happened. She didn\u2019t even know how it started or who brought it up. So from her perspective, you told your daughter (possibly without even having any prompting) \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be excited, it\u2019s going to be a big job for you.\u201d That would straight up look like sabotage without having the backstory. It would *look like* (not what you were actually doing, just how it would look without the backstory) you\u2019ve made her think that having a little sister is this horribly big job, making her not want to go to her moms as much any more. While she absolutely should have had a convo with you in private about this, alienation and sabotage is just so common in broken families that I can\u2019t actually blame her for over reacting a little. And as much as Reddit hates hearing this reasoning, she is currently pregnant *and* still getting over her previous miscarriage so getting upset was very understandable here. If you had told her about the convo before she got there to pick up daughter, she probably would have been able to see that your daughter *is* more excited than she was before but being a 6 year old she won\u2019t always express things properly.\n\nI\u2019m definitely in the minority, but I would say NAH. You\u2019re both trying your best, just might want to work on a little more co-parent communication to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings like this.\n\nAlso, you really really really should let mom know that daughter is starting to feel unloved. Mom needs to know that so she can rectify it on her part too.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re handling the situation the way the ex should be.

Is there someone that J might listen to (a sister, friend, mom)?  She needs someone to sit her down and explain that she is hurting her daughter and could very well lose her.", "NTA - you handled the situation with your daughter very well and sensibly ; you listened to your daughter's feelings validated them and responded to them in a childcentric manner", "NTA\n\nYou validated your daughter's feelings and made her feel better. A+ parenting. Your ex is probably just hormonal and upset she couldn't make her feel better, it'll blow over.", "NTA you handled that well. If she\u2019s interested I\u2019d explain what happened to your ex just like you did here so she\u2019ll be more understanding.", "NTA. Honestly, I think this is a healthy and very real discussion to have at 6 years old, especially since your daughter has the capacity to verbalize how she's feeling about becoming an older sister and realizing that there is going to be a drastic attention shift. While it probably doesn't seem ideal to her mother, this may actually help your daughter be better prepared for what's to come because you've given her the space to be able to confide in you. You're doing everything right!", "NTA", "You did nothing wrong. All you did was listen to your daughter, validate her feeling and attempt to positive spin for her as this will a big change at home. Also, I think for some kids under 10yrs, can struggle with parents pregnancies as they can find it to understand what baby will mean and it\u2019s can be abstract to them until baby arrives.\n\nHer mother did over react about your approach, and there is nothing you said was wrong/ It could be affects of pregnancy or she is trying to push the notion of happy/prefect families which is not in our daughters best interest.\n\nIf you have concerns about the situation for daughter, maybe sit down with her and discuss why she feels so left out, and if it\u2019s not adjusting to new baby/sibling, Then consider your  choices and options going forward.", "Nta, she needs to let people finish what they are saying before she reacts. Does she often cut your daughter off? Is this part of why she isn't excited? Your daughter needs to be able to openly discuss things with her mom, just like she did with you.", "NTA. I think you did an admirable job of handling the situation. J is clearly not balancing her attention and baby girl can feel the difference and doesn\u2019t like it. That\u2019s fair and I think it\u2019s awesome she was able to communicate her feelings so exactly.", "NTA.  Your new wife will need to temper her enthusiasm for her new kid just a little bit and make a go at helping your 1st daughter feel loved and accepted.", "NAH. You said something very helpful and a six year old who\u2019s still learning social skills told her dad in a way that made it sound awful.", "The kid is 6.   Getting upset about what they say is kind of silly.  Now, to be fair, you could work a bit more on the good points rather than \"you don't have to get excited\", but the script will get written when the kid shows up.", "This the mom needs to acknowledge she's dropping the ball big time to make her daughter feel ignored by her and everyone that comes around. That is completely wrong and she needs to address it before the baby is born and things get harder.", "Target carries a cute little board book called \"how to be a big sister\", and I am sure there are other similar books! Giving her something like that to take and read with mom might be a nice gesture to show that you're encouraging her to be a big sister, just also listening to her feelings.", "yeah, your daughter's feelings are perfectly normal. most little kids aren't crazy about getting a new sibling. especially when you are going from only child to big sibling. \n\neverything goes from all about you to all about the baby. it's one of the reasons that i always tried to include a least a small 'big sibling' present when i give a baby present to someone who is having their second child.\n\ncuz that's a HUGE change for a kid.", "If her child is crying to Dad, it must be cause Mom is only focused on new baby and not to her.", "My brother told my parents to take me back to the hospital when they came home with me.

I was happy to have a new sibling then I wasn't because my mom was tired more often and didn't have as much energy to play with me.  Then I got excited again helping set up the new bedroom then I was back to being mad that I was the baby anymore and didn't like that I had new \"responsibilities\".  I was 4/5 at the time.  Emotions are hard when you are little.  Children love routines and a baby changes that.  The encouragement that OP gave the daughter sounded like a perfect way to explain the change to a young kid and to validate her feelings at the same time.", "i was almost 4 when my younger brother was born and i also wanted to name him diarrhea lmao. i was excited for him to be born and loved him from the start, toddler me just thought it would be funny", "My niece insisted on calling her soon-to-be baby sister Chocolate.
