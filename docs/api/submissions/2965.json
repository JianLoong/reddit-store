Because babies cry and you cannot play with newborns and they sleep a lot. So that is not very fun for a 6 year old. And of course there are a lot of changes and the daughter is having to share all the attention. So that is difficult. You have to give a 6 year old some space to work through ALL those emotions. I recently had a baby and his brother feels a lot of emotions (excited, scared, annoyed). Pushing excitement as a mother is making sure the 6 year old will probably want nothing to do with the baby in the beginning.

Cuz I've seen this pattern before in my life and usually it's the setup for the mom trying to create a relationship with the older sister needs to be a caretaker, so the poster needs to have conversations with the ex about addressing this, and then if the ex isn't addressing it, the poster needs to be prepared to have conversations with his kid about it not being her job to be a caretaker for her younger sibling", "My sister tried to give me away to my gran", "What a horrible experience for the girl.", "It was. I divorced her dad about a year later and she was 9 at the time and she still doesn't have a good relationship with either parent cause her dad was just as bad", "NTA and your ex is pregnant so don\u2019t expect her to be 100% great at anything at the moment. You\u2019re a a great dad, keep doing the things you\u2019re doing.", "NTA\u2026 I think J misunderstood what your daughter said cause granted sux year olds kind of only say the main point without the context which can come off rather BLUNT to adults. \n\nJust remember OP, J is pregnant, her hormones are going to make her feel impacted by even the smallest remark if she feels it\u2019s in any way directly or even indirectly related to her.\n\nI don\u2019t think J realizes how this pregnancy is impacted her daughter right now since she\u2019s so swept up in it. \n\nIf you\u2019re in good terms with her 2nd husband, just explain to him what happened, he might be able to help J understand the situation if he\u2019s a reasonable person like you OP!", "NTA, your ex is a jerk for reinforcing the thought pattern your daughter is experiencing.\n\nMy guess is there's a good reason why your daughter is so upset and it's got everything to do with the way her mother is acting and speaking!", "nta, validating ur child\u2019s feelings is usually always the best move, especially when she feels her needs are already being ignored", "NTA. Show her this post. Sounds like she jumped to some conclusions about the conversation you had with your daughter and needs to slow her roll.", "NTA. You validated her feelings and are helping her adjust to the idea of being a big sister. Maybe her mother needs a reminder that your daughter is feeling invisible and can\u2019t feel excited about the baby if she feels unloved.", "NTA but they\u2019re being assholes for emotionally manipulating a child, and pressuring that child to feel a certain just so they can maintain the illusion of a happy family. NTA. Keep on supporting my your daughter and teaching her to not to a pushover to their bs/bs in general.", "When I was 9 years old my mom set me and my little sister down to break the news to us she was pregnant. My sister didn\u2019t seem to have much of a reaction from what I remember, but me? I burst into inconsolable tears, stormed out of the living room and locked myself in a closet for 3 hours. My mother tried like hell to calm me down, comfort me, get me to see the positives but I was not having it. She ultimately had to call over my grandma who brought over her spaghetti (this spaghetti was like my kryptonite, I could be bribed into just about anything if it meant I could have some). So grandma was successfully able to lure me out of the closet with a big bowl of spaghetti I then proceeded to stuff my face with in between the sobbing. \n\nWhile that whole situation was rather ridiculous to look back at it does make me laugh. Little brother and I are close as can be now so there was a happy ending after all. \n\nNew siblings are a major life altering event for any kid. Some handle the change graciously but others (like me for example) don\u2019t handle it as well. OP\u2019s daughter seems to be handling this rather maturely for only being 6 years old. Sounds like she has an awesome dad as well. She gon\u2019 be alright.", "What you said to your daughter is really similar to my favorite scene from the book Beezus and Ramona. Ramona, the younger sister, has been up to shenanigans and her big sister Beezus is frustrated about it. She confesses to her mother that she doesn\u2019t like Ramona all the time. Her mother tells her that\u2019s normal. Sometimes having a sibling is hard and you\u2019re not always going to like it. What\u2019s important is that you treat each other kindly and try to love each other even when it\u2019s hard to like each other. \n\nThis was a top tier parent conversation, OP. You did good, and you taught your daughter that her feelings and concerns are important to you and you won\u2019t judge her for them. She\u2019s going to remember that as she grows up and she\u2019ll know she can come to you when she needs support.", "Please talk to your ex and explain that your daughter is feeling ignored.", "Six year olds think everything is forever, the concept of time hasn\u2019t been figured out yet so she\u2019s confused about what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. Her feelings are valid even if she's only 6. My own daughter said she doesn't want a sibling when asked about it. Well, tough luck, she still got one and the relationship is as expected: they cuddle, bicker, play together and fight. The difference is we didn't make a big deal of it. I do understand that J is making a big deal because it is a rainbow baby. Still it is no excuse to push to the side the child you already raise and to force your perspective on them. What she should do is explain why she is putting so much emphasis on this pregnancy and tell her it was the same when she was pregnant with daughter. OP, J is the one who has to do damage control because she is the one who created the problem in the first place.", "NTA when my second child was born my oldest asked me when his mom was coming to get him. To say he was not excited to be a big brother was an under statement.   You did nothing wrong and your kiddos feelings are valid.  I hope her mother doesn't make your daughter feel like she's doing/behaving wrong.", "NTA. Both times I had a new baby I told my older kid(s) it was okay no matter how they felt, that babies can be hard, and they don\u2019t have to be excited. The three of them get along pretty well, and no one seems insanely jealous.", "Sounds like you did a great job, Dad. You validated your daughter's feelings which are indeed normal. You validated her mom's feelings of excitement and reassured your daughter that it didn't mean Mom loves her any less. You started planting the seeds of teaching her to be a good big sister.", "NTA, generally it's an AH move to tell someone, even a child who they should feel about something. It's great that you told your daughter that it's ok for her to feel her feelings. More partners need to do that.", "NTA.\n\nYou handled it exactly right. Kids don't always like the idea of being no longer the youngest but they also often love the idea of getting to teach.\n\nYou need to have a conversation with your ex that you will NOT try to force her to be excited when she is not, this is a big change in her life and she is allowed to have feelings about it other than joy and that you told her that as part of a discussion, where she was more excited at the end than when she started and that she is having normal complex kid feelings about it.", "NTA. You validated her feelings and helped her find a positive way to view it by giving her a role of her very own.  My son was 8.5 when my 2nd child was born and he asked me if I would love him less. We can\u2019t begrudge the kiddos their fears and feelings. Making them feel bad for it is a fast-track to anxiety and therapy.\n\nNot a huge fan of your ex not waiting for some context before jumping down your throat. Keep an eye on that because your daughter might start feeling caught between you two if J reacts that way again. She is also an AH for letting your daughter\u2019s feelings be minimized during an uncertain time.", "NTA. Trying to tiptoe between a daughter and a new spouse is hard. Just blame your wife's attitude on her pregnancy, everyone else does.", "NTA, some parents forget that half-sibling is term that applies and you can't make kids care about siblings that don't share both their parents.", "Good parents acknowledge their kids feelings and help them work through them, they teach them that feelings are ok but we don\u2019t have to hurt others when we are having big feelings and that it\u2019s ok and safe to tell your parents how you feel.  Mom is a total ass hole for not understanding that at all and clearly not even reading a single parenting book about how to help kids with a baby on the way.  It\u2019s not like her feelings aren\u2019t completely normal", "J can't instruct your daughter to be excited. She can only create favourable circumstances that foster your daughter's excitement. From the looks of things she's completely dropped the ball on that. J should be thanking you for making an effort to limit your daughter's resentment towards the situation. NTA", "Nta \n\nyou could have avoided this misunderstanding  with a phone call to j  after the discussion  with your daughter (outside her hearing of course) and made j aware of what your daughter was feeling so j can correct her behavior and discuss/explain/soothe  your daughter fears also.", "Awww because she probably loves chocolate a whole lot!! That\u2019s so *sweet* (hah).", "Oh wow. Do you still have a relationship with that girl?", "Yep. My ex kept us away from each other til she turned 18 and then we reunited. She's an awesome young woman who found love and learned what not to do in a relationship thanks to her parents lol"]}
