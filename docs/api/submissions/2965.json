Because babies cry and you cannot play with newborns and they sleep a lot. So that is not very fun for a 6 year old. And of course there are a lot of changes and the daughter is having to share all the attention. So that is difficult. You have to give a 6 year old some space to work through ALL those emotions. I recently had a baby and his brother feels a lot of emotions (excited, scared, annoyed). Pushing excitement as a mother is making sure the 6 year old will probably want nothing to do with the baby in the beginning.

Your daughter has had 6 years of being the only on both sides and now her entire world is going to change. A lot of the comments seem to assume that J is doing something wrong, when your daughters feelings are pretty common for oldest/only kids, even when their parents do everything \"right.\" It sounds like your coparenting relationship has been working pretty well, so this is the perfect time to check in and make sure that you're on the same page, so that you can continue to do what's best for your daughter.", "My new baby could not replace the old one in my heart.

I'd say no, then stop and \"listen\" to the baby and say, \"the baby wants you to have one for being such a greater older brother.\"", "Ex wife. Baby is not OP's. Only the 6 year old is OP's child", "We have friends who offered to their oldest to name the baby as well. They knew they had a bit of a rivalry problem when the child insisted on the name Diarrhea.", "Yep 100% parented the crap out of that situation.   \nOP seems like a good dad and is not the asshole in this situation.", "I think the ex also needs to be reminded that once baby is here to make darn sure she is still there for her 6yo events.", "My exes ex wife did that when she got pregnant. She went to her mom's the whole summer came back calling me mom, something she never did before, and refusing to go back. They sent a photo album of her summer and she was by herself the whole time and the only fun and exciting thing she did was go to Barnes and noble and pick out one book. She was gone almost 3 months.", "Considering how many people we see posting on reddit who have been parentified or whose parents have alienated them by comparing them to their siblings etc., hardly just my issue. It's a generational problem, and I'm definitely not the only person who was burnt by the 'it's your job to take care of your siblings' rhetoric. \n\nThe PARENTS are responsible for their children. The sibling is responsible to be a sibling, not teach or take care of the child they didn't even consent to have around.", "Not once did op state that OPs child needs to take care of their new sibling, also there is nothing wrong with being a good and responsible role model for your younger sibling.", ">reminded her that she\u2019ll have to teach the baby how to be a good kid and that\u2019s a big job", "That\u2019s not taking care/raising them. Showing your sibling how to be a good human isn\u2019t the same as physically caring for them\u2026.", "None of that is the job of a child.", "I don\u2019t think you are understanding\u2026 obviously it isn\u2019t a child\u2019s job to raise their siblings, but there is nothing wrong with being a good influence and showing your younger siblings how to grow up being a good and kind person\u2026 I think you are thinking both of those things are the same thing, which they aren\u2019t."]}
