A daughter was saying how J and everyone always talks about the baby and it makes her sad that J doesn\u2019t care about her anymore. I told her J still loves and cares about her I explained how everyone got excited like a party when babies are born and how it was the same way when she was born. She said she was not excited. I told her it was okay to not be excited right now and it was going to be a big change because she\u2019ll be a big sister. I reminded her that she\u2019ll have to teach the baby how to be a good kid and that\u2019s a big job but you\u2019ll have so much fun and the baby is going to love her so much for teaching them and will want to be just like her and that made her feel better. We had fun the rest of the time we were together. \n\nYesterday J  came to pick her up and my daughter said Daddy said I don\u2019t have to be excited for the new baby she also tried saying how I said how she\u2019ll have a big job as the baby\u2019s big sister. But J instantly got mad and called me an Ah for not encouraging our daughter to be excited about her new sibling.

J is obviously ignoring your daughter and is focusing on her new baby. Of course your daughter doesn\u2019t have to be excited for the baby.", "If course it's ok for her not to be excited.  Lots of kids aren't excited about new siblings for exactly the reasons she told you.\n\nNTA", "I don't see any problem with what you said. NTA.\n\nSounds like J is upset her daughter isn't excited.    New siblings is a big transition for a kid.  There will be mixed feelings.", "NTA for your conversation with your daughter. 10/10 awesome dad stuff there.\n\nBut teeny, tiny,slight criticism for not bringing this up with her mom. And not because of mom\u2019s feelings but because your daughter deserves to have both bio parents acknowledge her emotional needs and fears around the situation. Her mom is a big ol AH for going off like that - which was totally about her and not what was best for supporting your daughter. You can\u2019t control how she responds, but I wonder if a quick text as a heads up or even a 5 minute chat with bio mom after bed time could\u2019ve saved a lot of confusion for your daughter.", "NTA, it sounds like your explanation to her was perfect.", "NTA, validating your daughters feelings is the opposite of being an asshole. Brushing her off would have been much worse. Also, you actively tried to make her excited by explaining her new role.\n\nNo, i dont see you being in the wrong here", "NTA. Your daughter had concerns and you validated her feelings while also setting a model for her behavior going forward. She's 6, of course this is going to be a big event in her life, and she's not going to know how to feel. She needs to be reassured that she'll be loved and allowed to meet her sibling  on her own terms.", "NTA. I think you were absolutely right to validate your daughter's feelings. No one can be forced to be excited about something they have so much apprehension about, but you gave her good reasons to look forward to having a sibling in time.", "NTA.  You validated your child's feelings, that is a hallmark for good parenting! \nYou handled it extremely well and once the baby arrives she will be a great big sister. Keep on being a great dad.", "NTA. Like you said you just validated her feelings. You also explained more of the whole thing to her and made her kinda excited for it in some way. I mean.. you get a 100. Perfect dad.", "NTA, I was going to say you're the ass based on the title but I was pleasantly surprised. You allowed your daughter to have her own feelings and emotions, and you also advised her how to process what she was feeling. If you had told her she should feel excited she would've just shut up about her feelings and internalized any negative feelings. This probably would've ended up with animosity if you had. \n\nGood job dad \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. Her feelings are valid. You handled the situation correctly, imo.", "NTA.\n\nHer feelings are valid and you handled it perfectly.", "NTA, good job for validating how she feels.  Many children in the 5-6 yr old group, due to their own developmental milestones simply are not excited about being a first time big brother or sister.", "Definitely NTA.", "NAH. Without context, what you said sounds bad, but it\u2019s totally appropriate in context. Give J that context and talk together about how your daughter is feeling.", "NTA. Sounded pretty great what you said to her.", "NTA. J is ah for not listening properly to yours daughter.", "NTA - You and your ex need to have a serious discussion about this. If you daughter is already feeling overlooked, it may only get worse once the baby is born. Especially since she is only with her mom 1/2 the time and the baby will be with her mom full time. Your ex needs to take your daughter's feelings seriously, acknowledge that this may be hard/confusing for her, and work with you to make sure that your daughter is getting the support and feeling of security she needs.", "NTA. And you did an amazing job! You listened to and validated your daughter\u2019s feelings, that is so important. She will feel safe talking to you about things in the future, knowing you won\u2019t just shut her down.", "NTA. You validated her feelings.", "NTA You need to explain that you are letting her feel what she feels while pointing out the advantages of being a big sister.  Keep that part up.", "NTA, and good on you for teaching your kid that she doesn't have to lie about how she's feeling just to make other people happy", "NTA - A new sibling is a big event for a child to adjust to, and not all kids are excited about it. It can be a very stressful time for a child who now has to share the attention of a parent with a new person in their life. And it could be with any parenting situation where this insecurity occurs. You were being a good parent and trying to reassure your daughter that it didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t loved any less and she would still be involved in her mother\u2019s family.\n\nHer mother\u2019s reaction, however, is alarming. There was zero concern for her daughter in that reaction, zero attempt to reassure her, and zero understanding or attempt to reinforce the idea that she isn\u2019t being replaced. And that just screams that she\u2019s going to be. It could just be a knee jerk reaction to you as an ex being perceived as butting into her new relationship, but if it\u2019s not you should be on the alert to watch out for your child when the new baby comes.", "NTA. Your daughter is allowed to have her own feelings and you validated them. Like a good parent. Your ex needs to remember her daughter is a human, not a puppet with feelings and they won't always be the feelings she wants her to have.", "100% NTA. You're a good dad. It's normal for older siblings to have complicated feelings about a new baby at the best of times, and when a step-family is involved, those just double.", "> reminded her that she\u2019ll have to teach the baby how to be a good kid and that\u2019s a big job \n\nAnd it's the parent's job, not the kid's. Way to put extra pressure on her for no reason. \n\nOther than that, NTA, she has a right to feel what she is feeling, especially if her step mother is making her feel unimportant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not like you have her permission to throw the baby into traffic. Denying or getting angry at a small child for their emotions is quite harmful.

That puts unnecessary stress on the older sibling, it easily turns into parentification, and it leads to parents using one sibling against the other ('why can't you be more like your sister?') \n\nAs an older sibling who was regularly forced into these roles, it's a cruel thing to do. Let her have a sibling relationship with the baby, not one of authority and responsibility over them.  \n\nI understand you were trying to get her to be excited, but telling her she has to take on responsibilities to take care of the younger one was definitely an AH move.", "NTA she doesn't have to be and she's allowed not to be", "NTA watch out for that family dynamic, your six year old will need lifelong protections from J. Seriously red flags abound.", "NTA. This is pretty much exactly what I've told my kids when there's a new baby. 'It may seem like mommy and daddy are only paying attention to the baby sometimes, but babies need a LOT more attention than big kids like you! It's okay if you aren't excited or super happy about them at first, but once they start getting bigger you can do all kinds of cool things and teach them important kid stuff!'

You have the literal child development approved speech about big sisterhood to a six year-old who is feeling a little ignored and left out. \n\nShe then repeated it to her mom through a classic six year old viewpoint, and instead of listening and reflecting with her, her mom chose to ramp up the drama. \n\nI cannot stress enough that you had a full on TEXTBOOK conversation with your daughter. You said exactly what experts would recommend you say in the situation. You validated your child's feelings and reminded her she is important even if people are all about the new baby right now. You supported both her actual present emotions and her future positive engagement with the situation. You did fine.

Where you may have dropped the ball is in communicating with your ex.

That is a GOOD thing.  She is going to feel however she feels.  Allowing her to be open and honest is the best thing you could do.", "NTA you were validating your daughters feelings. There is nothing wrong with that. Your ex needs to start being more inclusive of your daughter in this. Clearly there is a reason why your daughter is not excited about this and is making the remarks that she is. It seems your ex is so focused on the new baby, she's forgotten about your daughter in all of this. She needs to get a clue instead of getting angry with you for listening to your child and validating her.", "NAH. having to explain that the only child is no longer going to be the center of attention sucks. the ex has other priorities and wants to ensure a safe pregnancy and birth and probably has some pregnancy hormones. i think you did a great job of explaining things to your child and their feelings will change over time.", "NTA - your ex is just being sensitive right now. Validating your daughter\u2019s feelings and telling her about her new role as a big sister is exactly what you should have done.", "NTA.

Never stop that.\n\nWhen I was born and brought home from Hospital, my older sister said:  Can we take her back and get a dog instead?  All she does is cry.", "ESH/NAH. It sounds like a misunderstanding. Your job is to make sure you're not undermining the other parent and turning normal child emotions into something problematic. It sounds like what you said was ok, but then it got distorted and she didn't trust you. She thinks you were like \"you can totally hate the baby and it'll be hard\" and you think you said \"it's ok to have conflicted feelings but you'll grow into your big sister role\". It was probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe solution is collaboration. When big things happen, you should both have a talk about it and make a plan. It's really hard with exes, but it can avoid so much drama.", "NTA. But, OP, you and your wife need to make some serious changes if you want your daughter to like this baby. First of all, your wife needs to adjust how she's talking and make your daughter feel important. We:\n\na) got gifts for our kids \"from the baby,\" \n\nb) told all family members they needed to focus on the older sibling first, before going to the baby, \n\nc) got our children baby dolls to help \"take care of\" to prep for the baby and made a huge show of how amazing they were with their babies, \n\nd) had our kids pick out a gift for the baby since the baby had gotten them a gift, and then had a gift from the baby at the hospital.\n\nOur kids LOVED their siblings. If I was nursing the baby, or whatever, and the older kid asked for a fruit snack. I'd say no, then stop and \"listen\" to the baby and say, \"the baby wants you to have one for being such a greater older brother.\" They'd run up and kiss the baby and run off. It was super cute!", "One of my sister's friends was named by their older sibling as a way to get the sibling more excited about having a baby sister. The sibling (6 at the time) named her a perfectly reasonable name, so the parents went with it. Later, grandma asked why they'd picked that name, and it turns out it was because it was the name of a kid in their class that they hated. Lol.\n\nThey have a great relationship now (which is why they share it as a fun family story), but the 6 year old was NOT happy about no longer being the baby.", "Exactly. I\u2019m glad that she has you giving her some attention. It would be so hard for her if the baby was yours and it would be you and J ignoring her.", "This is his ex, not his wife. It would be an overstep, or just weird, for him to do most of these.", "He can do a lot of it. And he can gently suggest it.", "Ah, I missed that it was his ex, but he can do some of these, and suggest them to her. Depending on their relationship. Anything so hid daughter doesn't feel abandoned by her mom.", "Stop pushing your issues onto Op and others. just because that\u2019s how your relationship was with your siblings and parents, doesn\u2019t meant all are like that."]}
