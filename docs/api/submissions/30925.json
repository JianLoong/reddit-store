Recently, we hung out with him and his wife in a situation where there was a lot of alcohol. My fianc\u00e9 and his brother are SUPER close. I\u2019m pretty sure if my fianc\u00e9 had to pick between us his head would explode. He idolizes him and I think that\u2019s very important for this story.\n\nAnyway, we were at this little get together and everyone was drinking a ton, except me. Afterward, my fianc\u00e9 wanted his brother and his wife to come back to our place to continue hanging out and I agreed to just drive the two of them home since I was sober. Everything was fine, they were pretty wasted and having a good time and then it came time for me to drive them home. My fianc\u00e9 hung back at the house and I drove the two of them home, his brother in the front seat and his wife in the back. She fell asleep pretty immediately and bro and I were just kind of talking and listening to music in the car. Everything was fine, and I legitimately think this was an accident, but at some point, bro put his hand on my thigh and then pulled away, not saying anything. I thought the lack of apology was weird but just assumed he was drunk and was used to his wife driving him home, so maybe it was just a reflex. I dropped them off, said nothing, and went home. I didn\u2019t mention it to my fianc\u00e9 just because I really think it was an accident and didn\u2019t want to put any kind of weird rift out there. If it happened regularly, maybe I\u2019d say something but I just didn\u2019t feel it was necessary.\n\nA few days later, bro asks fianc\u00e9 to hang out again. He asked me if I wanted to come but I said no because I had errands to run. His wife was also busy so it was just the two of them. When my fianc\u00e9 came home he was pissed off with me because his brother asked if I didn\u2019t come because it would be awkward and went ahead and told him about the thigh thing. I told him I thought it was just an accident and didn\u2019t want to bring it up at all. My fianc\u00e9 now suspects that I kept it a secret because there\u2019s something going on between the two of us and has brought up all these other times he\u2019s caught his brother looking at me a certain way, makes comments about my body, or how I laugh too much at his jokes, etc. \n\nShould I have said something? I feel like even with him being suspicious saying something would have made it seem like I was making a mountain out of a molehill, but maybe I am the asshole for keeping it from him?", "created_utc": 1699905341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uj82w/aita_for_not_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_his_brother/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you should have a talk with your fianc\u00e9 because the stunt your Future BIL pulled was disrespectful and dirty.  Your fianc\u00e9 blamed you instead of his brother who touched you in a way that didn't feel right to you. The fact that your Future BIL didn't bring it up to you, mention or even apologized for touching your thigh, but he saw it fit to mention it to your Fianc\u00e9? Why? He knew it was awkward when, whether it be an accident or intentional, he touched your thigh. He ignored it and made you feel uncomfortable about the situation, about mentioning or talking about it to anyone, especially your fianc\u00e9.\n\nYou should have a serious talk with your fianc\u00e9 about who's side he believes. You should reconsider this relationship before it continues because He should be asking your brother the questions, not you, if he truly felt something was gong on between you and him.\n\nEdited TO ADD:\n\n>*he\u2019s caught his brother looking at me a certain way, makes comments about my body*\n\n**THIS**!! Why is he even letting you're BIL make comments about your body?!? You'd think he'd stand up for you and tell his brother to back off, but nope. He suspects you of cheating with his brother... even though your BIL has clearly shown his interest in the situation.", "NTA I think it was reasonable to conclude that bro had too much to drink and it was a harmless mistake. Like you said, if it happened more than once, that would be different. What I find more significant here is your fianc\u00e9 is very quickly ready to assume the worst of you, distrust your intentions and even think you are lying and hiding things from him. \n\nHe also doesn\u2019t worship his brother by the way. He doesn\u2019t trust his brother either. If your fianc\u00e9 is now saying he has been noticing his brother looking at you certain inappropriate ways and making inappropriate comments about your body, what did he do to stop it and why has me never brought that up to discuss with you until now? \n\nWhy did he never mention his brothers comments to you ? \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 has some deep trust issues and I usually when a person is quick to suspect someone close to them is hiding something it is because they find it easy to hide things, themselves.", "INFO. What did your fianc\u00e9's brother say about the situation in the car? Did he tell him that it was just a mistake?", "NTA at all. You thought your future BIL's action could have been reflex, and were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and not call him out unless he did something like it again. Your husband needs to come correct here though and not blame any of this on you.", "NTA but if your partner cannot trust you then you need to address it before you even consider going ahead with a wedding.", "Youre fiance sounds very stupid. \ud83e\udd23 NTA.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is the one making a mountain out of a molehill. You assumed bro made a drunk mistake and immediately corrected it. No biggie. I don't see where there was anything to tell him (and if you had, he might have accused you of trying to cause drama). There is no winning with this.", "NTA, and it seems they pulled a very nasty one, his brother basically hitting on you and your bf blaming YOU for it.\n\nI'd reconsider the relationship. If your future BIL cannot keep his hands to himself, does not apologize TO YOU, but blabbers to his brother, and your BF suspecting YOU of doing something untoward... can be a source of problems you do not want in the future.", "NTA\n\nI would have assumed it was an accident and just moved past it as well.  Now if they had done more than just briefly touch your leg then I would have said something.", "NTA. \n\nFianc\u00e9 is a dumbass. It was an accident. I think there's some shit going on with him if he's now having a confirmation bias thing going....?", "NTA\n\nThe brother is being weird, but the bigger issue is your fiance.  You were the victim of this behavior and his first instinct was to believe that you are a cheater and he showed you that he doesn't actually trust in your fidelity.  He didn't ask for your side, he didn't give you the benefit of the doubt before hearing you out, he immediately jumped to suspecting you and assuming you're lying and decided you were unfaithful because you dared -laugh- with another guy.  Even worse was that even his brother admitted that he thought you were staying away because him touching you like that weirded you out, proving you weren't interested in him.\n\nI don't think just reassuring him that you love him and have no interest in his brother will solve the bigger issue.  He doesn't trust you and he was already becoming paranoid about how another guy looked at you and spoke to you, but never once brought it up with you and asked how you felt about it or brought up that he trusts you but finds his brothers behavior inappropriate.  This is not a relationship that should be considering marriage yet when he doesn't communicate, blames you for the actions of other men and is monitoring your normal behavior and reading bad things into it.  That's a major problem.  If him not actually trusting you is not dealt with now, you will have even more problems later on, especially if you're married and can't easily leave.", "NTA for thinking it was an isolated accident absent the context which your fianc\u00e9 later provided.  \n\nNow, even prior to the reveal of what your fianc\u00e9 thought, I thought this was a move on the brother's part.  It's testing the waters and gauging the reaction.  It's walking beside a girl you like and your hands touch \"accidentally\".  \n\nThe brother ratted himself out to make himself guiltless in the situation.  Of course he'd mention it, it was an accident and had no ill intent so therefore it doesn't mean anything and its fine to talk about and bring up.  \n\nYour husband thinking something is going on speaks to trust issues he has all around.  With both you and his brother.  \n\nGiven the totality, I'd say you and fianc\u00e9 should do a little couples therapy before going any further.\n\nAnd I don't really see a reason for either of you to trust the brother and you should sever ties.", "NTA I\u2019ve been in this situation more times than I\u2019d like to admit and if you think it was a mistake it\u2019s better to not open that can of worms and the fact your BIL mentioned it anyway makes me think even more that is was a genuine accident your BF needs to check himself and the fact he keeps mentioning how he keeps catching his brother he should take that up with him", "** Responding to the bot - I meant to say when he was drunk, not I", "What is the brother's end game here? He acted badly, for family harmony you ignored the bad behavior, but not he's shit stirring your finace up in arms?\n\nNTA - but you might need a referee to handle this as a neutral person. A clergy member, therapist, someone with no skin in the game and some training in dealing with high emotions.", "NTA. If it was just on your leg for a second before he pulled away, it was a one time thing and you legitimately think it was just an accident, I don't know why you would report that to your fianc\u00e9e. If the BIL felt like it was a big enough deal to bring up though, I'm kind of wondering if he DID intend it as flirtatious/sexual and then quickly thought better of it", "I can understand why you didn\u2019t say anything but you need to ask your fianc\u00e9 why he hasn\u2019t shut his brother down for his actions down. \n\nIt sounds like his brother has done this in the past and has made justification for doing it.", "NTA\n\nSo your man is blaming you for his brother's behavior? Ugh.", "Then it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 is overreacting. Both of you said it was an accident. I'm not sure what his brother has said about your body but it sounds like you're fianc\u00e9 is paranoid. Maybe something happened in the past with another girlfriend?", "NTA - Your BIL is making trouble for no reason and your fiance is an idiot. Are you sure he wants to marry you? Or you want to marry him?", "End this relationship. You will never be able to trust your fianc\u00e9s brother and your fianc\u00e9 is far too quick to blame you for his brothers actions. \n\nNothing good will come from pursuing this relationship. Walk away now before your fianc\u00e9s brother escalates his behaviour.", "not a true AH.. but still.. should've said something", "Lucky you!  You discovered your fiance's jealous side before you married him.\n\nNTA\n\nPay attention to this huge red flag.", "I wouldn't want to be married into a family of drunkards.  Nothing good will come from that. The situation you are in now is just an example of many things that can go wrong.  Also, it is customary when giving a ride to a couple, that if a man is driving, the husband sits in the front seat, and if a woman is driving, the wife sits in the front seat.  That's even when everyone is sober, let alone when you are giving a ride to a bunch of drunkards.\n\nOnce drinking and being drunk are treated as normal, expect crazy things to happen.  And, combined with treating this seating arrangement in the car as normal, expect more crazy things to happen.\n\nI wouldn't want to be in this situation (this whole situation, being married into that family, I wouldn't want that).", "NTA - you were there, and your fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t. You used good judgment by avoiding making a mountain about a molehill. Again, you were there and *I* wasn\u2019t. If you truly thought it was an innocent accident by a really drunk person, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nAnd boy is your fianc\u00e9 have his head screwed on wrong \n\nHe suspecting the wrong person for the wrong reasons \n\nAre you sure you want to marry somebody this messed up?", "Telling your fiancee about a situation that made you uncomfortable would have been the right thing to do.\n\nIf it had been an accidental misunderstanding it could have been resolved, if it wasn't accidental your fiancee would have been able to address the issue.\n\nLetting him find out on his own puts the possibility you weren't uncomfortable with it in the frame.", "NTA", "NTA. Also, wondering with BIL is sitting in the front seat rather than in the back with his wife. Could be nothing in it.

You didn't think it was deliberate.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My fianc\u00e9 now suspects that I kept it a secret because there\u2019s something going on between the two \" .. you lied to him by omission. this caused much more damage in your relationship AND the relationship with his brother than telling him would have done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow could he trust you, KNOWING you keep things from him?", "YTA you should have let it go until/unless it happened again.

You gave him the benefit of the doubt. Now you know not to do that again. \n\nYour BIL was testing your boundaries. A genuine accident = apology to you. Jealousy and annoyance that his test didn\u2019t work = telling your fianc\u00e9. \n\nWhether you went to the meet up shouldn\u2019t have affected his ability to apologise. He\u2019s annoyed that you retreated, refused to see him, and he reacted immaturely to twist the situation.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is massively insecure and a misogynist. You were the victim of gross behaviour, not a perpetrator or coconspirator - he needs to aim his fury at his gross brother for touching you inappropriately! And shut down any inappropriate comments about your body/appearance. What is wrong with these two men?", "NTA, i can understand where fianc\u00e9 is coming from but I'm definitely on your side. I also think the brother should've put more explanation when he talked to your fianc\u00e9. Because now it looks like your fault when it isn't.

IMO That\u2019s a bit naive.  Many of us have been blackout wasted and not touched others inappropriately.  You wouldn\u2019t do something like that, so you tried to rationalize why BIL did.  BIL did this on purpose after getting liquid courage and knew by doing this when he was drunk it gives him an excuse.  When you didn\u2019t show up for hanging out, BIL got nervous and confessed to try and cover his butt. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is a man and knows BIL excuse is BS.  Also being drunk doesn\u2019t make it ok.  He\u2019s now questioning his trust in his brother which has him questioning if he can trust you as well because you purposefully kept something from him.  Explain this situation is uncharted territory and it was easier to pretend nothing happened and protect his relationship with his brother than deal with reality that BIL using alcohol as excuse to disrespect you, your brother and your relationship. \n\nTalk to fianc\u00e9 about best way to move forward and clear the air.  This isn\u2019t something you can pretend didn\u2019t happen and it will likely be awkward for BIL.

I think you and fiance need to do some couple counseling before you proceed with getting married.\n\nYou experienced on momentary inappropriate move from the brother and were inclined to assume it was an accident unless you saw a pattern. For that reason, you decided not to say anything. All very reasonable. What you didn't know is:\n\n1. Your fiance HAS noticed a pattern that includes looks and comments about your body. He also feels you have been laughing too long at brother's jokes. Despite this, he had no problem staying behind and having you drive a drunk brother and SIL home.\n2. Fiance has never discussed his concerns with you (either about your 'suspect' laughing or his brother's actions.\n3.

(I must be dumb, but I think if I believed my fiance were uncomfortable being around my brother because of HIS actions, I would not believe she is a willing participant in anything inappropriate.)\n4. And again, your fiance is mad at... Y.O.U.\n5. Your fiance has a lot of emotional issues to work through and a lot of maturing to do regarding being your partner. He really needs counseling of his own, too. For these reasons, do not proceed to marriage unless he works on this.\n6. As for the brother... Maybe he does have a crush on you/ the hots for you. A crush can be managed and moved past; the 'hots' is not OK. Unless you feel an discomforting look from him, it's hard to judge looks; but comments (if he actually makes them) are not OK. \\[I'm not sure what brother said to fiance... whether what brother said or fiance heard infused the tone of something inappropriate going on.\\] But your fiance took away your chance to observe brother's pattern and come to your own conclusion.

I would, however, be very irritated if I were in her shoes and all of this transpired and I didn\u2019t know about it. The right thing to do would be for her husband to tell her but he doesn\u2019t strike me as I stand up guy", "I like the group chat option. There\u2019s no \u201che said she said\u201d and everyone can see what everyone else says and there are no secrets. Just \u201chey, the other day bro touched my leg while I was driving y\u2019all home. I was uncomfortable and he stopped but didn\u2019t say anything, so I considered it a drunk mistake on his part and let it go. Then he talked to fiance about it and now there is drama. \n\nFor my part, what I\u2019d like to see happen is an apology to me, not just to fiance, and an assurance it won\u2019t happen again. Since I\u2019m not interested in bil and surely he has no interest in me, I\u2019m very confident we can all get on like adults and family members from here on. \u201c"]}
