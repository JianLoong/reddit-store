My friends told me not to make any plans for Saturday evening (yesterday), as they wanted to take me out for my bday, but they wanted it to be a surprise.\n\nMy friends Mike (23m), Iris (22f), Nick (21m), and Tony (21m) picked me up. They insisted on a blindfold so it would be a surprise & I trusted them 100% so I said yes. We've all been friends for a few years now so I had no reason not to trust them.\n\nWell, about 20 or so mins later, we parked & they walked me in, still blindfolded. Immediately, I felt sick to my stomach. It was loud & all I smelled was alcohol.\n\nA little backstory: I started drinking around age 12y/o, and I was addicted by age 15y/o. All I cared about was alcohol. It was the first thing I thought about when I woke up & the last thing i thought about before going to sleep or passing out. I had pretty shit parents that didn't care as long as I left them alone. I gave it up on my 20th bday, when my sister passed away after being hit by a drunk driver. She was my absolute best friend. It was a very rough ride, but eventually I got better, I got sober. So yesterday made 1yr of my sobriety.\n\nBack to yesterday: as soon as the blindfold was removed, I almost threw up seeing the bar in front of me. I told my friends I wanted to leave right away.\n\nThey followed me outside, trying to get me to go back inside. Mike was yelling & Tony, Iris, & Nick were begging me to go back in & \"enjoy myself.\"\n\nI was crying. I was so upset that they would even think this was a good idea. When I said so, Tony said that they all thought it would be good for me to \"relax\" with a drink, since they all know the day would be stressful for me since it was a year since my sister's passing. Mike told me \"it's about time to get over it & have a drink again\" so I could \"have a little fun again.\"\n\nApparently, according to all my friends, I was way more fun when I was drinking.\n\nI got an Uber & went home alone. I'm STILL getting texts from my friends saying I'm an AH for ruining their surprise for me. Now I'm thinking maybe I did overreact like they said.

You are never wrong for doing what you need to do for your physical or mental health.\n\nThat said - the people (I will not call them your friends) who had the \"surprise\" for you were being supremely selfish - they were preying on your illness for their own reasons, and hiding it behind a \"birthday surprise.\" This is downright evil.

All they care about is a person who will get drunk with them, they care nothing about your health or your well-being.\n\nAmong other things, if they *truly* cared about you, the would have thought about what *you* wanted for the surprise, instead of what *they* wanted.

NTA AT ALL!\n\nThis situation shows how much these \u201efriends\u201c only care about themselves and their own enjoyment. I think it's generally selfish and inconsiderate when someone plans a birthday for someone else and doesn't take into account what the birthday girl likes in the first place. But to force you to drink alcohol on your birthday even though you are sober with the background knowledge of your grief is just horrible of these people.\n\nI really hope that you will soon find new people who will support you in everything and be there for you.", "Block them all.

Find a way to celebrate both those things(Which do NOT include having a drink).  If it helps, this internet stranger is SO proud of you.", "NTA but those people aren't your friends.", "NTA. They aren't friends if they're sabotaging your sobriety.", "NTA, and I want to speak specifically to this:\n\n> Apparently, according to all my friends, I was way more fun when I was drinking.\n\n\"Friends\" who say stuff like this aren't your friends.  They're telling you, to your face, that you're only interesting and worthwhile when you're drunk.  They do not respect or value you as a person: they view you as entertainment, a drunken monkey who might do something they can laugh at.  (That's *at*, not with).\n\nYou're nobody's monkey.  You should be _so_ proud of yourself for a year of sobriety - and your friends should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that taking you to a bar was a good idea.  If they cared about you at all as a person, they wouldn't have done that.  If they cared about you as a person, even *without* the trauma of you losing your sister to a drunk driver, they would have realized \"Hey, OP doesn't drink anymore, let's plan a fun thing thing for their birthday that doesn't involve alcohol.\"\n\nThey didn't do that, which makes them absolutely the assholes here.  And you deserve better than assholes for friends.  This wasn't a mistake on their part, it wasn't something they did for you at all: it was something they did for themselves, because even though _you've_ moved on from drinking, they haven't.  They still think that a good time requires alcohol, and they don't respect you enough to spend a single evening without getting liquored up.  They're accusing you of overreacting and \"ruining their surprise\" to obscure their initial fault of the surprise in question being something they _knew_ you wouldn't enjoy.\n\nNow, that said, it's possible that not all of them are a write-off.  The reality is, most 20 year olds are assholes.  That's just biology: their brains haven't finishing developing yet.  Most 20 year olds also tend to be innately selfish, and have a hard time with empathy, because they just haven't experienced enough of the world to be able to relate to anything other than their own narrow lived experience.  If you want to give them a chance, I would suggest asking them, in group chat, why they thought you would enjoy going to a bar to celebrate your birthday when you've been sober for a year.  If their responses are along the lines of \"you're more fun when you're drunk,\" or \"we just wanted you to drink and enjoy yourself,\" well, that's confirmation that they weren't thinking about _you_ and what _you_ would like at all - and why keep hanging out with people who don't care about you?\n\nLosing friends is hard.  But when people show you who they are and how they actually feel about you, believe them.  Unless any of them actually acknowledge wrongdoing and apologize, I would strongly encourage you to let them fall out of your life, and to find new friends who respect you and the very mature decisions you've made.", "NTA. Oh the RAGE that I'm feeling right now on OP's behalf... Seriously there are no words. This is a level of disrespect that goes beyond anything I could EVER forgive.\n\nOP THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. DUMP THEM ALL. RIGHT NOW.", "NTA. They might just be young 20-somethings who haven't had enough life experience to understand how bad what they did and said is. Either way, they are not the friends you need right now in this stage of your life and sobriety journey.
