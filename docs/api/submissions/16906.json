Your sister is exhibiting clearly dangerous behavior and callous, childish disregard of your reaction to it.  Your mother\u2019s reaction also has \u201chorror movie\u201d written all over it.  I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that sentence sent a chill up my spine.\n\nA passing interest in matches isn\u2019t pyromania. It may be something she saw someone else doing and thinks it\u2019s edgy. The risk of a house fire is very high, though, especially with the prevalence of plastic fibers. A single lit cigarette, a frayed wire, or a sun catcher can cause a house fire so sticks designed to make fire really good are pretty obviously a hazard. \n\nWhether your sister is a true pyro or not, even escalating aggressive or bizarre behavior (intimidating and gaslighting someone for example) is of immediate and serious concern. Your sister is 23, and her disregard for your normal reaction to having a lit match flicked at you was inappropriate, and your mother\u2019s reaction is downright bizarre. If you feel unsafe, you need to take actions to protect yourself. A fire safety plan and an extinguisher are good places to start. Locking your bedroom door at night, checking the smoke detectors, et cetera. If you feel actively threatened, make a plan and get somewhere safe ASAP. It might feel like an overreaction, but it\u2019s better to be slightly embarrassed in the future than to ignore your gut and potentially end up dead.\n\nPyromania starts very small and increases in severity of behavior over time just like other antisocial behaviors such as exhibitionism and kleptomania. Small acts of deviance have diminishing returns, and an increase in risk level over time is the only way to maintain the thrill or psychological response. If you notice an escalation of dangerous or antisocial behavior \u2014 both with the fire and the disregard for others\u2019 feelings/safety \u2014 or increasing levels of erratic behavior from your sister, do what you can to alert your parents or other family members.", "NTA your family is gaslighting you", "take them to the mf fire house for THEM to explain, they are usually perfectly happy to do it! my mother had a boyfriend insistent on getting his way and would play with matches at like 25 years old!! and started a house fire!!

She has what we call \"pre-disaster attitude.\" She's the kind of person that ends up on the news looking like a moron.", "NTA. As someone who\u2019s house burned down. This is not ok. It happened due to cold ashes from a fireplace watered down and put in the concrete garage. Yea a match can absolutely burn a house down.", "NTA. also, what the fuck?", "NTA. I handle homeowners claims with fires like this ALL THE TIME. If it wasn\u2019t for people like your sister, I wouldn\u2019t have a job. The head of the match could still ignite a surface it comes into contact with.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister sounds embarrassingly immature. \n\nPlease show her (and your mom) these responses.", "NTA and get some renters insurance and make a go bag of loved items for when the fire comes.", "NTA. This is seriously disturbing.", "NTA - One of my core memories was doing this, it landing in the carpet, and not going out. I jumped on it before there was a big fire and never did it again. She's gonna end up burning the house down one day.", "NTA- she\u2019s gonna burn the house down and then what? Insurance isn\u2019t gonna cover \u201cthrowing a match for fun\u201d. She could even get charged with arson! She\u2019s definitely dumb", "Nta .. she absolutely could start a fire.", "NTA.  One match can start a fire.  Why take the chance when a moment's carelessness could be enough to destroy your house?", "Yeah I got drunk and lit a hotel towel on fire on accident by throwing my match into the bin without wetting it. The brief hit of the towel before it landed in the trash was enough to start a fire and it wasn\u2019t immediate. Noticed a burning smell around 4 minutes after and ran in to find a smoldering towel. No damage other than the towel thank god", "NTA\n\nMy aunt, her husband and their two children died in a house fire before i was born, and i think it was from a lit candle. A singular candle. It took a lot of time before my dad allowed candles in the house, and in the beginning only candles that floated in water were allowed because chances of them lighting the house on fire were extremely minimal.", "Ohh one of my brothers did this as a kid, ended up setting my other brothers bed on fire while he was in it. My brother has burns on his arms & legs. My brother that did it is still a pyro \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. Do you have carbon monoxide detectors in your house? Your sister and mom seem like they have comorou mental unfortunately. Please stay safe.", "I didn\u2019t have to read past the bold printed headline. NTA", "NTA Your sister is too old for these types of pranks. Good way to set someone on fire or start a fire. It sounds like your mother approves of this type of nonsense.", "Will you update us when you're homeless and all your possessions are reduced to ashes? NTA", "\"Play with matches, you could get burnt\"", "My little cousins (they were 4 at the time) dropped a lit match on a sofa cushion that burned their house to the ground and killed their older brother. They were too young to know any better and were not prosecuted. Your sister is a moron and there is something wrong with her and your mother.  She is old enough to know better and to be prosecuted for even accidentally starting a small fire. Get out of there!!!!", "NTA. Dropped a match when I was 7 and it caught a building on fire. Burned the place to the ground since all the tiny bibles and shit and the carpet caught fire. I haven't fucked with a match since.", "Your sister is possessed and your NTA.", "terrifying but hilarious that your mother's response was \"i used to be scared of matches too. :)\" like what the hell?? the match on your floor actually seems threatening and leaving it there to upset you is really shitty, to be honest. definitely NTA.", "Tell your sister this is how my friend (8 yo at the time) burned down a house, got taken into therapeutic foster care and considered for juvenile detention.  Fire is no fucking joke.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA - I would move out. I would be quite pissed if this was how I went out in my sleep.", "NTA. Your sister is a moron, and so is your mum.", "Lol!  Only for being so controlling.  \ud83d\udc95", "NTA and feel free to die on that hill. Why does she even think she's entitled to doing that?", "NTA, just cause the flame goes out, does not mean it will not burn skin due to the heat.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is an idiot.", "NTA. When she burns her house down in the future you can just say \"I told you so.\"", "Hey all!  So I'm definitely new here and was excited to join this one, but I can't help but feel most of the AITA questions seem so crafted.  I mean, obviously whoever we are that post the question will be biased...it just has almost been laughable some of the ones I've been reading.  Like AITA for cleaning up dog shit in my house?  I made that up of course but it seems like what's going on here a lot.  Sorry for the ignorance!  Is this normal here?  Appreciate u all and hearts and stars.", "NTA and even if it blows out it can still burn you or your clothing. I feel bad for your mom who is becoming desensitized to it as well. Your sister needs to stop.", "NTA get your sister a copy of Strewelpeter", "So NTA! People forget that what starts a fire is the heat, not the open flame. So yeah, even if the match is not lit anymore, as long as it's hot, it can start a fire or cause burns.\n\nAs other said, get out of that house ASAP. In the meantime, take every means necessary to assure your safety, and keep a fireproof blanket on your bed. They are easier to use than fire extinguisher and can save life.\n\nGood luck to you!", "Sounds like she's going to burn a house down one day. Lost a friend in college because someone didn't put out a cigarette. 4 college kids died that night.\n\nShit happens. She's ignorant.\n\nNTA", "Yeah I have scars from matches both still lit and matches that had gone out right before. I get it, fire pretty, but your sister is being reckless and playing with everyone's lives. So many things these days are flammable and people don't even realize they are. Very obviously NTA.", "Lock on door before she burns you alive in bed!", "More like move out of the house asap if OP is not a minor. If this isn\u2019t an option and they won\u2019t have sense talked into them, here\u2019s another option although it\u2019s a bit dark. Ask your sister if she thinks the match is hot after the flame is blown out. Presumably she will say no. Then tell her to prove it by blowing out the match and immediately placing it on her skin. Maybe a burn will teach her what common sense hasn\u2019t.", "Or a fire blanket, instead of an extinguisher. These can be difficult to use under stress, blankets save life", "She clearly didn't grow up watching those sad Bambi commercials lol", "My brother in law was a fire bug when he was young. One time he was lighting matches and  tossing them on the floor in front of him, well he got real unlucky and a lit one stuck between his toes. Didn't learn his lesson then however, another time he was tossing matches in a deep freeze the neighbors used for trash bags. Started a fire and instead of telling any of his siblings he ran to his room. Thankfully his sister, who was baby sitting, noticed and was able to go and put it out.", "NTA - you sister is playing a dangerous game. \n\nPeople often underestimate just how flammable things are in our homes. \n\nI know someone who was smoking sitting on their couch. The lit part of the cig (aka the cherry) fell off and fell between the cushions. They tore the cushions off looking for it and couldn't find it, and so they assumed that it must have gone out and turned to ash.  About 5 hours later, guess who's couch was engulfed in flames. The fire department said that the cherry must have fallen further into the couch and smouldered for hours until finally the smouldering fibres got hot enough to actually ignite the fibres of the upholstery. Apparently, this is common with bed fires, too, where someone falls asleep while smoking and the cigarette and surrounding upholstery/materials just kinda smoulder until it finally fully ignites.", "The glitter body spray stuff is as well. Girl in town died when a fire spit a hot ash and it landed on her. She did not survive the burns.", "Fabric softener, icy hot, cleaning supplies are all flammable not to mention a plethora of other household products."]}
