Your sister is exhibiting clearly dangerous behavior and callous, childish disregard of your reaction to it.  Your mother\u2019s reaction also has \u201chorror movie\u201d written all over it.  I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that sentence sent a chill up my spine.\n\nA passing interest in matches isn\u2019t pyromania. It may be something she saw someone else doing and thinks it\u2019s edgy. The risk of a house fire is very high, though, especially with the prevalence of plastic fibers. A single lit cigarette, a frayed wire, or a sun catcher can cause a house fire so sticks designed to make fire really good are pretty obviously a hazard. \n\nWhether your sister is a true pyro or not, even escalating aggressive or bizarre behavior (intimidating and gaslighting someone for example) is of immediate and serious concern. Your sister is 23, and her disregard for your normal reaction to having a lit match flicked at you was inappropriate, and your mother\u2019s reaction is downright bizarre. If you feel unsafe, you need to take actions to protect yourself. A fire safety plan and an extinguisher are good places to start. Locking your bedroom door at night, checking the smoke detectors, et cetera. If you feel actively threatened, make a plan and get somewhere safe ASAP. It might feel like an overreaction, but it\u2019s better to be slightly embarrassed in the future than to ignore your gut and potentially end up dead.\n\nPyromania starts very small and increases in severity of behavior over time just like other antisocial behaviors such as exhibitionism and kleptomania. Small acts of deviance have diminishing returns, and an increase in risk level over time is the only way to maintain the thrill or psychological response. If you notice an escalation of dangerous or antisocial behavior \u2014 both with the fire and the disregard for others\u2019 feelings/safety \u2014 or increasing levels of erratic behavior from your sister, do what you can to alert your parents or other family members.", "NTA your family is gaslighting you", "take them to the mf fire house for THEM to explain, they are usually perfectly happy to do it! my mother had a boyfriend insistent on getting his way and would play with matches at like 25 years old!! and started a house fire!!

They tore the cushions off looking for it and couldn't find it, and so they assumed that it must have gone out and turned to ash.  About 5 hours later, guess who's couch was engulfed in flames. The fire department said that the cherry must have fallen further into the couch and smouldered for hours until finally the smouldering fibres got hot enough to actually ignite the fibres of the upholstery.

Fire safety as a concept exists because fire is inherently dangerous.", "NTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is some weird power flex on her part. She's doing it because it makes you uncomfortable, because she wants to show that she gets to decide what your boundaries are, because every time the house doesn't burn down she gets to mock anyone who has a problem with her acting crazy and eventually calling her out for being a lunatic will be a one way ticket to being treated as a pariah, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's likely not super thought out, but sometimes when people find out that just not giving a fuck is a loophole through social convention, they use it to just casually humiliate everyone around them so that they can be the top of their little hierarchy. So not necessarily Machievellian, but definitely intentional. Throwing lit matches at people is not something people do because they think it is okay unless they are mimicking something they saw on some show, and mimickers don't have the social IQ to convince their own mother that the appropriate response is to expand how much disrespect they're willing to receive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this was a kid, I'd recommend therapy. For a 23 year old? I'd buy a small, cheap bottle of some flammable lotion or body product. Pull it out in front of your mom and sister and be kind of excited to have some new things, and then look at her and freeze, mid sentence. Make it look like you suddenly thought of something that you hadn't realized. Then act kinda pissy when you throw the bottle in the trash. Go for a mix of deflated, disappointed, and more than a little indignant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen either one of them asks what that was about, say, \"I never even imagined that the reason I can't have nice things is because my lunatic sister might accidentally set me on fire.\" Then make a show of going through your bathroom and throwing away anything flammable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point of all this is to behave like someone who is having to be responsible for their own safety in an environment where people throw matches at you so that your mother starts seeing your sister as a person who throws matches at people. Right now she's having too much fun enjoying the identity of being someone who 'gets' to throw matches at people, and she gets to do that because the only consequences anyone is having to deal with are the emotional reactions that she wants. When it goes from 'OP freaks out, but nothing bad happens', to 'we can't have nice things,' the narrative shifts a little out of her control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOR maybe she has a new boyfriend who throws lit matches at her as some form of kinky fireplay. Maybe drop a line that you don't judge her new fire fetish, but you're not into incest. People do sometimes get really fucking creepy when they discover a new fetish, and sometimes they do need to get called out hard to realize how out of control their excitement about self discovery has gotten.", "NTA, I guess she'll find out when she's charged with arson.", "This has \"Tonight at 10\" written all over it.
