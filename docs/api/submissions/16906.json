There is a reason people are told not to play with matches.  Having said that, this isn't something to argue about.  State your position and just keep stating the same thing.  There really isn't an argument here.", "NTA. Match could burn someone before burning out. And yes, it could start a fire, esp if it's thrown out before it's fully gone out. \n\nYour sister sounds silly. At first I thought she must be a child then I re-read and she's 23?!? Show her this \u2014 sister, you're too old to playing like this with matches.\n\nAnd what the heck's wrong w/yr mother? Just smiling and shrugging it off?

Has your sister exhibited signs of mental illness before?\n\nObviously NTA but I\u2019d let your parents handle this because she\u2019s standing over you while you sleep with matches, maybe get a lock for your bedroom door.", "NTA. Get a spray bottle of water and spray her with it every time you see her holding a match or find a burned out one.", "NTA and WTF. Yes, playing with matches is bad.\n\nYou don't have to be afraid of matches to realize that throwing lit matches around is incredibly stupid.\n\nLots of fires in history have been started with just one match.\n\nLock your bedroom door and stay as far away from your crazy sister as you can.", "NTA\n\nPlaying like that is extremely dangerous. Sometimes the wind isn't strong enough to blow the fire out. A similar situation happened with my uncles and it ended up killing my grandmother. You should seriously talk to her about being more responsible.", "NTA. Your sister has a problem. First of all, one match *can* burn down a house. Second, it isn\u2019t just one match - apparently your sister is doing this multiple times, which increases the chance of it hitting something flammable. Third, even if the flame is out, the embers on the tip can still be hot enough to ignite flammable substances. \n\nHer saying that you don\u2019t trust her is her trying to turn the blame back on you (typical of bullies - which is what I thought of her when she threw it at you). And it sounds like she has already worn down your mother. \n\nFinally, her leaving the burnt out matches on the floor is just lazy - she needs to learn to pick up after herself like most people learn to do when they are toddlers.", "When I was 17, one of my little brothers got a hold of some matches and was lighting and throwing them. We didn't have a house and lost our pets by morning cuz the house burned down. Your sister is a massive AH and a flipping moron.", "Take her AND your mom to the local firehouse.  Ask them to educate these two twits about the dangers.  I'll bet they have stories about small children playing with matches and burning down a house with possible fatalities. \n\nNTA. Your sister needs help", "NTA. There is a difference between being afraid of matches and being downright stupid. One day the match will drift in the wrong direction and your house will be toast. \n\nSorry, but your mother isn't very bright either.", "NTA\n\nTime to find a new place to live. Gather all you important documents and get them somewhere safe yesterday while you sort out your living situation. Make sure you have one of the personal use fire extinguishers in your room.

Very obvious NTA. That\u2019s weird  behavior and literally could start a fire - why on earth would she think it couldn\u2019t?

Honestly it sounds like a mental illness in her brain if she thinks its okay.", "NTA Step on the match and smear the coal around the floor.", "YTA, clearly your mom and sister want to burn down the house for the insurance money and you're getting in the way by being afraid of arson.\n\nThat was a really weird thing for your mom to say.", "NTA - you can in fact set the house on fire this way. If I were you I'd make sure anything of value is safe or in a fireproof safe.", "Nta, you should go to the local firehouse talk to the firefighters. One of the volunteers would happily stop over and have a chat with your sister.", "Info: are your sister and mother mentally handicapped?", "[removed]", "NTA What a weird, irresponsible thing to do.", "NTA. This is beyond bizarre.  Your mother's reaction is ridiculous.  It's not afraid of matches it's afraid of fire, and one match could easily light a house fire.  And throwing fire at someone is horrible.", "NTA????? call the police or something that could kill people please call someone about this.", "As someone who used to play with matches a lot, your sister is an idiot. Especially if she stared at the flame for a while before throwing it. If she immediately lit and threw, she might have a point as the wood hasn't burned long enough to have an ember. But once it's burned for a few seconds, that ember doesn't die immediately. It'll relight given the right circumstances. NTA", "NTA  Your sister sounds like a pyromaniac. She's way to old to be behaving that way with zero regard to fire safety. Yes, it is possible for a single match to start a house fire. It all depends on the kindling. What if it lands on a book? or a rug? or anything flammable? Get your sister some help, or keep her away from matches.\n\nAlso, what's up with your mom? This has nothing to do with a fear of matches. It's a fire hazard.", "You\u2019re not crazy, NTA. \nSincerely, the person who stood on their bed watching the house behind us burn down with three of my little buddies inside who had been playing with matches when one caught a mattress on fire. I was six.", "Your family is apparently insane. This whole thing freaked me out. NTA and I'm scared for you.", "There have been plenty of cases where someone blows a match out, puts it in the trash, and still warm embers completely destroy the house. Throwing lit matches (anywhere really, but especially in the house) is going to backfire on your sister someday.", "NTA, this is dangerous, and your sister may end up learning that the hard way. Also, due respect to your mom but that statement is also freaking weird. You're not afraid of matches. you're concerned about someone being irresponsible with matches.", "I was walking with some friends in high school and one of my friends started doing this, lighting matches and tossing them. One of the matches went into my shirt and left me with a nice little burn, and this was outside with a breeze. In a house with still air and many flammable objects this is an eventual fire", "Write up a contract stipulating that, in the unlikely event that her actions cause a fire, then she and she alone will be responsible for all excesses on insurance claims and the difference in premiums going forward.\n\nIt's almost certainly not legally-enforceable, but I bet she'll at least hesitate before signing. That's the moment to jump in and press her on just how certain she is it'll blow out.\n\n...And also on why insurance premiums matter more to her than giving you serious burns, but that's another matter.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
