{"id": 8353, "submission_id": "10m07er", "title": "AITA for for following my husband when he walked away from me after being gone all night and coming home at 4pm?", "selftext": "My husband is a hard worker at a very demanding job. He is scheduled to work from 0630-1500, but rarely makes it home before 1730.  \n\nOccasionally he\u2019s as late as 2100ish. I have repeatedly asked that he call to let me know when he\u2019s running very late so I can make adjustments for dinner for me and our 12yo.  He\u2019ll remember for a few days before reverting back. \n\nHe tells me not to worry-he\u2019s too busy to call and he\u2019ll be home as soon as he can. I told him that asking me not to worry when he\u2019s late is a slippery slope- that he\u2019s basically asking me not to care and that\u2019s not good!  \n\nWe compromised on location services being enabled- it\u2019s not perfect as it does not let me know when he\u2019s coming home, but at least I can tell if he\u2019s at work or on his way home at dinnertime. I only use it maybe a couple times a month- I have no desire to keep tabs on him. Of course he can see where I am, too and I have no idea if he uses it or not.\n\nA few times a year he works weekend nights. On those times I don\u2019t expect him home before midnight, more likely I wake to find that he has come home after I went to bed and he\u2019s asleep on the couch. \n\nHere\u2019s the AITA moment:\nA couple of weeks ago he was working on Saturday- all day- went in at 0700, came back at 2030. Not an hour later he gets called back in. Couple of things to keep in mind here- this is Saturday and Monday (a holiday) is our kid\u2019s birthday party AND he\u2019s taking my car to work, leaving his classic truck that I do not know how to drive, nor would I want the responsibility of doing so. \n\nAs he\u2019s walking out the door I tell him don\u2019t be gone all day- I have errands to run for Monday\u2019s party, and we\u2019ve got dinner plans Sunday night. I laugh as I tell him \u201cso you\u2019d better be home by 4!\u201d  It\u2019s a joke as he\u2019s NEVER worked all night into the next afternoon. \n\n\nWell\u2026Sunday rolls around and he\u2019s not home.  1000, 1100, noon and still nothing so I go to check location services. They\u2019ve been turned off. I am puzzled. 1300, 1400 and now I\u2019m pissed. I have shit to do and he has my car. 1600 rolls around and he strolls in like nothing\u2019s wrong. The only thing I trust myself to say is \u201cwhat up, dawg?\u201d then I grab the keys.  As I\u2019m walking past him he says \u201cwhat?  What did I do?\u201d  I just go. \n\nLater, when  we returned from dinner and I have significantly calmed down , I ask him why he didn\u2019t even apologise for being so late and he said \u201cwhy? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You knew where I was\u201d.  He says he slept at work, then woke up at noon and detailed the car. \u201cWhat else do you think I was doing?\u201d  Then he tells me he\u2019s done talking and walks away. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be TA- I followed him into our bedroom and raised my voice (a little- our kid was in the next room) and said that he has disrespected me and if he can\u2019t see that then he\u2019s an idiot. If he really gave a rat\u2019s ass he would call. He said nothing. \nHe has not mentioned it again. \n\nAm I the asshole here?  I really don\u2019t think so, but he\u2019s standing his ground so hard that I can\u2019t tell anymore.\n\nEdited for spelling/grammatical mistakes", "created_utc": 1674761387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m07er/aita_for_for_following_my_husband_when_he_walked/", "score": 529, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the very least, he is being passive aggressive with you because he doesn\u2019t want to be an adult with a partner and a child to give you the minimum courtesy of letting you know when he will be late.

That's not fair to you or your kid, I'm sorry you're going through this.", "> **I really don\u2019t think so, but he\u2019s standing his ground so hard that I can\u2019t tell anymore.**\n\nalarm bells ringing out of my ears. this has never happened before. you're right to feel disrespected. stand your ground too, this is feeling like the beginnings of gaslighting do not let it take hold. your position makes perfect sense and his refusal to engage apologise or explain is very unreasonable and suspicious. especially answering with a question, \"what else do you think i was doing?\", i dont like it.

Especially if we are about to go in to a surgery or similar where it would be very difficult to contact us. \nIf we foresee that we could be gone an exceptionally long time that would be clearly communicated in advance and contingency plans made.\n\nYour husband is a selfish prick", "NTA He could be cheating. More like it was a power play. Didn\u2019t like being told what to do. Either way, he is an ass.", "NTA. At the end of the day your husband is treating you like crap and being super inconsiderate. I wouldn't jump to divorce court just yet but like how others suggested, put a tracker on YOUR car. He is definitely hiding something and it can't be good. If you do confront him without evidence he will just gaslight. Be careful though, he'll call you a crazy stalker too when he can't deny that he's at some place he shouldn't be. I think he maybe be paying for prostitutes IMO.", "NTA. So many shady things going on here. Wonder what the hell he\u2019s doing out there. Is he even bringing in noticeably more income?

He has a location tracker on his wife\u2019s phone so he knows where she is.", "Reading through this, I can't see how there's any chance he's not cheating or something else really bad. The fact that the location tracker was a shitty compromise for him not being able to take 5 seconds to send a text and then he turned it off? So he's too busy to text, but not so busy as to turn off his location tracker - why on earth would he turn it off if he wasn't going somewhere he's not supposed to be?\n\nAlso, just this whole \"I know not letting you know I'm going to be late upsets you, but just get used to it because I don't want to spend a few seconds to text you\" shows that even if he's not cheating (he is), he doesn't care anywhere near enough about OP's feelings.", "Yeah my ex also slept at work a number of times over many years so it didn\u2019t seem like a red flag.\n\nIt was cheating.

That way if I rollover and he\u2019s not there, I can glance at my phone and see if he\u2019s hanging out or on his way home. \n\nIs it silly? Sure, but it brings me peace of mind.

Into a ditch, or bump it into a post. Make sure you have a backup key so he can't just hide the keys. He'll think twice about taking your car if his truck's at risk.", "Exactly. If you can't drive his car, you can't follow him.\n\nMight be time to stick a tracker on the car. Careful if you two have iPhones, though, pick a brand that won't alert the iPhone.", "Yeah, why else wouldn\u2019t he have taken HIS car so you could run your errands while he was at work?\n\nThat\u2019s the shittiest thing he did, which is maroon you indefinitely at your house.", "I don't think you're stupid.
