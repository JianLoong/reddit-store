{"id": 8353, "submission_id": "10m07er", "title": "AITA for for following my husband when he walked away from me after being gone all night and coming home at 4pm?", "selftext": "My husband is a hard worker at a very demanding job. He is scheduled to work from 0630-1500, but rarely makes it home before 1730.  \n\nOccasionally he\u2019s as late as 2100ish. I have repeatedly asked that he call to let me know when he\u2019s running very late so I can make adjustments for dinner for me and our 12yo.  He\u2019ll remember for a few days before reverting back. \n\nHe tells me not to worry-he\u2019s too busy to call and he\u2019ll be home as soon as he can. I told him that asking me not to worry when he\u2019s late is a slippery slope- that he\u2019s basically asking me not to care and that\u2019s not good!  \n\nWe compromised on location services being enabled- it\u2019s not perfect as it does not let me know when he\u2019s coming home, but at least I can tell if he\u2019s at work or on his way home at dinnertime. I only use it maybe a couple times a month- I have no desire to keep tabs on him. Of course he can see where I am, too and I have no idea if he uses it or not.\n\nA few times a year he works weekend nights. On those times I don\u2019t expect him home before midnight, more likely I wake to find that he has come home after I went to bed and he\u2019s asleep on the couch. \n\nHere\u2019s the AITA moment:\nA couple of weeks ago he was working on Saturday- all day- went in at 0700, came back at 2030. Not an hour later he gets called back in. Couple of things to keep in mind here- this is Saturday and Monday (a holiday) is our kid\u2019s birthday party AND he\u2019s taking my car to work, leaving his classic truck that I do not know how to drive, nor would I want the responsibility of doing so. \n\nAs he\u2019s walking out the door I tell him don\u2019t be gone all day- I have errands to run for Monday\u2019s party, and we\u2019ve got dinner plans Sunday night. I laugh as I tell him \u201cso you\u2019d better be home by 4!\u201d  It\u2019s a joke as he\u2019s NEVER worked all night into the next afternoon. \n\n\nWell\u2026Sunday rolls around and he\u2019s not home.  1000, 1100, noon and still nothing so I go to check location services. They\u2019ve been turned off. I am puzzled. 1300, 1400 and now I\u2019m pissed. I have shit to do and he has my car. 1600 rolls around and he strolls in like nothing\u2019s wrong. The only thing I trust myself to say is \u201cwhat up, dawg?\u201d then I grab the keys.  As I\u2019m walking past him he says \u201cwhat?  What did I do?\u201d  I just go. \n\nLater, when  we returned from dinner and I have significantly calmed down , I ask him why he didn\u2019t even apologise for being so late and he said \u201cwhy? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You knew where I was\u201d.  He says he slept at work, then woke up at noon and detailed the car. \u201cWhat else do you think I was doing?\u201d  Then he tells me he\u2019s done talking and walks away. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be TA- I followed him into our bedroom and raised my voice (a little- our kid was in the next room) and said that he has disrespected me and if he can\u2019t see that then he\u2019s an idiot. If he really gave a rat\u2019s ass he would call. He said nothing. \nHe has not mentioned it again. \n\nAm I the asshole here?  I really don\u2019t think so, but he\u2019s standing his ground so hard that I can\u2019t tell anymore.\n\nEdited for spelling/grammatical mistakes", "created_utc": 1674761387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m07er/aita_for_for_following_my_husband_when_he_walked/", "score": 912, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the very least, he is being passive aggressive with you because he doesn\u2019t want to be an adult with a partner and a child to give you the minimum courtesy of letting you know when he will be late.

He took the time to slowly detail your car, which screams malicious compliance to me. Like he was looking for things to do to take up time until 4pm.\n\n3. He only works weekend nights, per you, a couple times a year. If he\u2019s cheating, I would expect it to be more than once every 6 months.\n\nI know this is Reddit where everyone loves to jump straight to cheating, but honestly\u2026 I\u2019m just not getting the vibe. Which brings me to why everyone (except your kid) is TA:\n\nYou\u2019re TA because, we\u2019ll, put yourself in his shoes for a moment. He works crappy hours, had to work Saturday, had barely gotten home and hadn\u2019t even had time to relax before being called back into work (you words, \u201cless than an hour later\u201d) which REALLY sucks for him, and then on the way out the door\u2026 instead of you being supportive you tell him \u201cyou better be home by 4\u201d. That\u2019s being a jerk to him and, if he was already tired from work and frustrated that he had to go back would come off really badly. Even if you meant it in jest, AITA is full of people who are all \u201coh noes, I made a joke at my partner, they took it wrong, and now they\u2019re upset with me\u2026\u201d Speaking from experience, I can\u2019t stress enough how much it sucks to work a long Saturday, get home thinking that you can finally relax, only to get called back in before you can even get your shoes off and put your feet up! A little compassion goes a long way.\n\nHe\u2019s also TA because, frankly, malicious compliance isn\u2019t the way you deal with your partner being a jerk to you. In my opinion, he should have gone back to work, finished and come home. Had a good nights sleep and then calmly explained why your \u201cjoke\u201d was so upsetting. Instead, it appears that he was trying to \u201cteach you a lesson\u201d through malicious compliance.\n\nI don\u2019t know your specific situation, but it sounds like you don\u2019t work\u2026 which is a valid choice to be a SAHM, I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t\u2026 but if he is the only one of you working and you aren\u2019t independently wealthy than cut him some slack on the hours he works. He\u2019s literally providing for a family, and you do what it takes (including working nights and weekends).\n\nA couple additional thoughts for all the \u201cred flaggers\u201d out there:\n- Sleeping at work. Seriously? I have what would be considered a \u201cwhite collar\u201d job and sleeping at work once in a blue moon (actually, less frequently\u2026 it sounds like this is the first time he\u2019s done that) isn\u2019t all that uncommon. I don\u2019t know what his job is but I personally have (just off the top of my head) slept on the couch in the office, on the floor under a cube in the office, and on the raised tile flooring of a server room. Sometimes, after being up for 18+ hours and basically working the whole time you\u2019re so tired you\u2019re dizzy and it\u2019s not safe to drive home without a nap. Other times, you are done with work at like 3am, but have to be functional at work at 8am. Do you take the hour each direction to get home, get cleaned up, go to bed, sleep for 3 hours, get up and ready, and go back to work? Or do you nap for 5 hours at work?\n- Not using your phone at work to check in. I, again, don\u2019t know what his job is, but mine often times requires putting my phone and any other RF emitters and cameras into a steel lockbox at the entrance to a building and not getting it back until I leave. Im going to use the restroom in the building rather than piss in the bushes, so texting while on a potty break just isn\u2019t gonna happen.\n\nBring on the downvotes. :)\n\nEdit to Add: it\u2019s been suggested that you use a hidden tracker on him. That\u2019s a bad idea.

When you'll be out of this pit, you'll look back and ask yourself how the fuck could you listen to all of his bullshit.", "Yeah, the bottom line here isn't that he's cheating or doing drugs or gambling or a workaholic, or whatever. It's that he apparently has a certain amount of contempt for your desire to hear from him or have a vehicle you can use to do errands--to the point that he doesn't feel he has anything to be sorry for in this situation.", "Wait... so you told him what he needs to do to make you feel like a member of this marriage/relationship and he told you you don't need it? So basically he just doesn't care about your needs or feelings, along with all the shady shit he's pulling. Get out while the gettings good.", "Drive his stupid classic car next time to see if he's at work.", "Any reason he shouldn't be taking his truck?", "Gaslighting for sure. The term is way too often misused, but this is the sort of situation it was coined to describe. He's trying to make you feel crazy for having reasonable concerns.\n\nIt's very understandable that you want to default to trusting your husband, but he's wildly abusing that trust. Trust isn't given, it's earned and \\*maintained\\*. By continually doing things that require a high degree of trust on your part while dismissing your concerns and demeaning you for having them, he's actively degrading that trust, which a total shit thing to do \\*even\\* if he's innocent (which I doubt).\n\nYou deserve a partner who takes your feelings seriously, and that is not what he's doing at all.", "Absolutely.  Whenever someone tells you that what you\u2019re feeling is wrong, or you\u2019re deficient for feeling that way, it\u2019s gaslighting. Also, if they try to make you mistrust your own intuition and instincts.", "The trouble is that you have sunk costs invested in this relationship.  There is a kid to care for.  You have committed mind, body, and soul to this man with the understanding that he was doing the same for you.  \n\nBut he isn\u2019t.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re trying to spackel  over the cracks in the relationship, to fix it, to make it like it used to be.  Because you love him.  Because it\u2019s exhausting to parent on your own.  Because divorce is expensive and emotional.  Because you don\u2019t want to lose custody of your kids for even a minute.\n\nBut he is treating you like you don\u2019t matter.  And you do.  \n\nAnd you deserve better.", "Yes, this is what it feels like.", "Could be a mister.", "OP. It disturbs me that this is the explanation that you latch on to, while ignoring the literal hundreds of people who can see that he is having an affair. \n\nI was wondering how you hadn\u2019t caught on. Now I get it. You don\u2019t want to catch on. \n\nIf you\u2019re fine turning a blind eye, then do it. Good luck to you. But, stop bothering asking him where he\u2019s been or when he\u2019ll be home.", "Hubby is a surgeon. I've gotten calls from the circulating nurse to tell me that it's going to be a long night. There is no excuse for this dude's total lack of respect.", "This is what a second phones for. Give that number to work and leave the other in your locker or desk and get it later after whatever shady shit you're doing.", "Yeah, so if she takes it into her head to scrounge a ride and go to his work, he'll know and he can scurry back there to pretend he's been there the whole time.", "Cheaters gravitate towards careers that give them cover.", "No doubt he has more than one phone but OP doesn\u2019t know about that", "My ex did this. Signed into her iPad at work and turned it off on the phone. The only reason I found out was two weeks later I received a photo ticket in the mail from another city. Of course, she said it wasn't her but the Marine Corps license plate was a dead giveaway. \nSounds exactly like what the ops husband is doing.", "I don't think it's silly at all. It's sweet.", "Salary typically doesn't require time punches.  You only track off/vacation time", "I'm so glad I'm not the only one who went there!", "Imagine you're married with a kid and mortgage, entwined your whole ass life with someone who clearly has no interest in being honest, it's very hard to just walk away without knowing. This isn't some 20 year old college fling. Honestly I would need to know. I think OP has that right. He's clearly up to no good.", "And he has her location tracker on her phone, so if she scrounges a ride to go check on him, he'll know and can get his ass back there before she arrives.", "With a kid!  What if the kid gets sick or does something like break an arm - something that isn't a 911 emergency, but still needs prompt medical attention?  She's stuck at home and he's incommunicado.  What an asshole he is.", "Someone else suggested this (it was u/CrazySeacreature) but you should put a tracker on your own car and watch its location. See where it goes when he's at work and has it since he's turning off his location.  \n\nBecause he's doing something sketchy. Why else would he leave you trapped at home then turn of his location and disappear? And your location is on so he knows he can track you. Turn yours off next time he leaves and see what happens. I'm curious if he will call to make sure you're home...", "You can also put an AirTag in your car. Or leave AirPods in your car and see where your car is going during these absences. The fact he turned location off and disappears long term with your car is shady and inconsiderate. NTA. He\u2019s waving a lot of red flags.", "If it does go missing, I think that's enough of an answer anyway. \n\nYour husband is *so* shady. If you want to know what he's up to, you could put a location tracker on one or both cars. I'm not sure whether you really want to know what he's up to, but with his shady behavior there is 0% chance that *nothing* untoward is going on.", "I'd consider putting spyware on his phone. I don't normally advocate invading someone's privacy, and people are free to disagree with me here, but it's obvious he isn't going to be obvious. You're married with a child, you deserve to know the truth.", "You could run a free credit report, make sure he doesn\u2019t have hidden credit cards or is siphoning money into a separate bank account.  Do you have an old phone collecting dust?  Could leave that one in the back seat under the floor mat.  \n\nHis disrespect for you is astounding.", "I had to check my abusive cheating ex's paystubs and I made sure to do it when he was asleep, so he wouldn't get suspicious and hide them. Although he did say a couple of them went missing but he was terrible at hiding things and I found them in his truck that he never drove. Like another person said, it could be nothing and he was being passive aggressive because your comment bothered him. Either way though he clearly has no consideration for your feelings if he can't take less than a minute to send you a quick text.", "Body glitter is time consuming to get out of fabrics. \ud83d\ude0f", "I don't love this sub's propensity to jump straight to cheating, but in this circumstance your head needs to be SO far underground. \"He slept at work?\" Have you ever tried to sleep in an office chair? Probably not. I bet his \"workday Saturdays\" are him on a getaway with his mistress.", "Whomever??", "At the very least, they have to log into some sort of system. If he wants to provide proof, there is a way.", "Ha ha, when I was bingeing my way through Criminal Minds I was pretty sure that 99% of the men I saw around me were serial killers.", "To add to that consult with every single one of the best divorce attorneys in a 5 county radius.  By just consulting with them it means your soon to be ex can\u2019t be represented by them as is violates ethics and creates a conflict of interest.", "No federal or state law caps the number of hours in a workday for most workers. However, workers under 16 years old are not allowed to work longer than 8-hour days. Other occupations, such as truck drivers, may have regulations that limit their workday.", "Or god knows what else. Ew.", "Who\u2019s probably also married hence the need for a car detailing.", "Not necessarily.  I am salary and logging in is not required.  We only have to log in to enter time off.", "You must work for a trusting company. Where I work everything entered by everyone is logged.", "I had an overtime audit of hourly employees working for a local government less than 5 years ago where they'd get paid out the ass, but they absolutely were being called back into work and working a whole day after a 16 hour shift.  We specifically looked at the legality of their shifts after realizing that one guy had more than 58 hours in a 72 hour period and outside of some union regs that required at least an 8 hour break after 24 consecutive hours, they were being paid, meals covered, and cots to sleep on if there wasn't time to go home before they needed to be back, there was nothing illegal about it.\n\nThat said, OP's husband is waving all the marinara flags.\n\n*edited for missing word.", "You have this backwards. Salary means you aren\u2019t hourly and thus there isn\u2019t clocking in and clocking out.", "I understand just fine.\n, but where I work, salaried and hourly punch a clock.", "He sure is working hard, but not at work."]}
