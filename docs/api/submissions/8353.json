He is scheduled to work from 0630-1500, but rarely makes it home before 1730.  \n\nOccasionally he\u2019s as late as 2100ish. I have repeatedly asked that he call to let me know when he\u2019s running very late so I can make adjustments for dinner for me and our 12yo.  He\u2019ll remember for a few days before reverting back. \n\nHe tells me not to worry-he\u2019s too busy to call and he\u2019ll be home as soon as he can. I told him that asking me not to worry when he\u2019s late is a slippery slope- that he\u2019s basically asking me not to care and that\u2019s not good!  \n\nWe compromised on location services being enabled- it\u2019s not perfect as it does not let me know when he\u2019s coming home, but at least I can tell if he\u2019s at work or on his way home at dinnertime. I only use it maybe a couple times a month- I have no desire to keep tabs on him. Of course he can see where I am, too and I have no idea if he uses it or not.\n\nA few times a year he works weekend nights. On those times I don\u2019t expect him home before midnight, more likely I wake to find that he has come home after I went to bed and he\u2019s asleep on the couch. \n\nHere\u2019s the AITA moment:\nA couple of weeks ago he was working on Saturday- all day- went in at 0700, came back at 2030. Not an hour later he gets called back in. Couple of things to keep in mind here- this is Saturday and Monday (a holiday) is our kid\u2019s birthday party AND he\u2019s taking my car to work, leaving his classic truck that I do not know how to drive, nor would I want the responsibility of doing so. \n\nAs he\u2019s walking out the door I tell him don\u2019t be gone all day- I have errands to run for Monday\u2019s party, and we\u2019ve got dinner plans Sunday night. I laugh as I tell him \u201cso you\u2019d better be home by 4!\u201d  It\u2019s a joke as he\u2019s NEVER worked all night into the next afternoon. \n\n\nWell\u2026Sunday rolls around and he\u2019s not home.  1000, 1100, noon and still nothing so I go to check location services. They\u2019ve been turned off. I am puzzled. 1300, 1400 and now I\u2019m pissed. I have shit to do and he has my car. 1600 rolls around and he strolls in like nothing\u2019s wrong. The only thing I trust myself to say is \u201cwhat up, dawg?\u201d then I grab the keys.  As I\u2019m walking past him he says \u201cwhat?  What did I do?\u201d  I just go. \n\nLater, when  we returned from dinner and I have significantly calmed down , I ask him why he didn\u2019t even apologise for being so late and he said \u201cwhy? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You knew where I was\u201d.  He says he slept at work, then woke up at noon and detailed the car. \u201cWhy else do you think I was doing?\u201d  Then he tells me he\u2019s done talking and walks away. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be TA- I followed him into our bedroom and raised my voice (a little- our kid was in the next room) and said that I\u2019ve has disrespected me and if he can\u2019t see that then he\u2019s an idiot. If he really gave a rat\u2019s ass he would call. He said nothing. \nHe has not mentioned it again. \n\nAm I the asshole here?  I really don\u2019t think so, but he\u2019s standing his ground so hard that I can\u2019t tell anymore.", "created_utc": 1674761387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m07er/aita_for_for_following_my_husband_when_he_walked/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the very least, he is being passive aggressive with you because he doesn\u2019t want to be an adult with a partner and a child to give you the minimum courtesy of letting you know when he will be late.
