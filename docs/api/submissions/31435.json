If your mom only has a one month to live, then her organs and body are already severely compromised.  The surgery will probably make her remaining time with you worse than if she didn\u2019t have the surgery.\n\nIt sounds like you and your mother have not made peace with her condition.  You are pinning your hopes on one more Christmas with your kids, but what happens if that is a Christmas where she is in the hospital and on a respirator unable to communicate?  What happens if she doesn\u2019t come out of anesthesia?  Then your kids have no more time with her.\n\nAn alternative would be to make every day she has left a Christmas Day with your kids.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the money.  This is about how you want your mother to spend her remaining days with you and your kids.\n\nI have watched members of my family pass, including on Christmas.  I have also seen some doctors, in their quest to be god, sacrifice quality of life for quantity of days, achieving neither.\n\nGet a third opinion.", "What does your mother want. Really, it is about quality of life now at the end. Does she want the trauma of surgery for a few more months? She has to undergo an operation and recuperate during that time. Is it actually about the money or you not accepting that she is going to die soon?", "NAH. I totally get wanting to try to extend your mom\u2019s life, but I don\u2019t think this is a good option. The money isn\u2019t even the issue. The surgery could be unsuccessful, she could die on the operating table (thus doing the opposite of what you are aiming for), she could have even less quality of life and be miserable for the extent of any extra time she does gain, etc \u2026 This is just barely extending the inevitable. I\u2019m so sorry for your situation, but I tend to agree with your husband.", "NAH- I lost my mom just over a month ago. I'm very sorry for what you are going through. From your post it makes it unclear the amount of money you are talking about. But I will say from experience, that if it's only going to buy such a short amount of time. It's not worth it. I mean surgery that can extend your life an unknown amount of time is definitely worth it. Bc an extra year can turn into 3 years, and by then who knows what can happen. But do just delay a death by a month or so. It's going to leave a hole. \n\nThere isn't going to be a perfect time to lose your mom. I'm so sorry. Trust me I really know the feeling. My answer really isn't about the money. If the doctors are saying it's something that could truly extend her life, I would say go for it. But it's not going to help as much as you feel like it will. Bc as I said. There isn't gonna be a good time for this to come.\n\nVery sorry", "This shouldn't be about the money. Ultimately, Only your mother and her doctors can make this decision.\n\nBut your post sounds like your main concern is that your mother have one more christmas with your kids. And that's not a great reason to do surgery that will only prolong life for a few months. Surgery is risky, debilitating, and painful and so is the recovery. Is all that worth a few extra months?\n\nIf Christmas is the main concern, DO IT NOW. Decorate the house. Make her favorite foods. Buy gifts, wrap them. Hire a Santa to pass them out. Do whatever is the best version of Christmas for your Mom and do it now. There's no need to wait for December.\n\nDo everything in your power to make her final months happy and comfortable and full of love. If, when everything is weighed, that includes the surgery then do so. But is it really about that? Or about your mother and yourself not being ready to let go?\n\nReddit can't answer those questions. But your mother's doctor probably has a way to refer her to an end of life counselor that can help *her* answer those questions. And help you deal with whatever her answer is.", "Can\u2019t understand why your mum would let you spend that money that might give her extra 3 months might not I would never let my daughters do that", "NAH.  This is an emotional issue and as a detached observer I get both sides. However, I also feel that unless you just have stupid money to the point the cost isn't a concern, significant expenses in a marriage should be a joint decision.\n\nHow would the expense of the procedure impact the immediate and future finances and potential for the family and kids?  How much are those extra few months worth and what would the quality of life for mom in that time be?  What is the success rste?  No one here can answer any of these questions, but a more mature discussion that doesn't involve running to Reddit is needed.", "Soft ESH. So \u201cwe\u201d have the money he had from before you were married, but the money you had before you were married is YOUR money that YOU earned? That\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re married, which means all the money belongs to both of you and ideally you would both be in agreement about any significant spending. Your comment that he\u2019s \u201cinevitably going to twist the story\u201d sounds like there are other issues in your relationship. Saying that it would be \u201csilly\u201d to use the money for that purpose is pretty low, though.", "I read your husband's post. He sounds awful.\n\nBut poor mom..\nA few months? Is the pain and trauma of surgery worth it?", "Soft ESH. I just lost my aunt who was like a second mother to me, because of cancer. So I understand you wanting to do everything for her, but there comes a point where you need to start thinking beyond that and have serious, hard conversations, and make difficult decisions. As much as it hurts to accept your mom is not too to make it. This operation is not necessary, what is necessary is for you and her to start thinking about her last days, how do you guy\u2019s want to spend those. What lasting memories do y\u2019all want to make. I understand you, trust me.., you want to spend every penny, you want to try every new drug/surgery, but at one point you have to say enough. Acceptance is huge, you have to take a step back and accept that she\u2019s leaving. A \u201cpossible\u201d extension of maybe 3 months is not worth the risk or the money. The quality of life, her last moments however are priceless. What if she doesn\u2019t make it during the operation? What if she comes out and has more issues than before? Would you be okay if something happens to her during the operation? Instead of the surgery, focus on having lasting conversations with her, what are her burial wishes, maybe y\u2019all can take a trip, ask questions about her childhood, her adult life, record her and so on. Taking care of a sick person is already a huge financial responsibility, in my opinion I wouldn\u2019t do the surgery. It\u2019s just not worth the risk, or her quality of time. Also, I did read your husband\u2019s post and he\u2019s a jerk for saying mom basically abandoned you. However, I do agree with him about the money.", "NTA\nI read your husband's post.  He said your mother was abmn absentee mother...  Only mentioning that she was working two jobs in the comments. He made her out to be neglectful and generally an awful person. He's an AH. If this money was so important to the family surely he would have been looking for it before now?  He's jealous of the time and investment you are putting into your mother.  With any luck you will realise you don't have to put up with his pouty behavior once you are the other side of this.", "Pretty sure your husband made a post about this same issue", "First, my heart goes out to you and your family. I hope you're able to enjoy your time with your mom. \n\nNTA, but I hope you and your mom are being honest with yourselves about her quality of life, not just the quantity. As I'm sure you've been told, surgery is no joke and recovery can be a lot to deal with. \n\nGood luck with your decision!", "Can you link to his post so we can get both sides of the story?\n\nINFO:  Do you both earn about the same amount?  Would you be ok with him taking the money he had from before you were married and giving it to his family? \n\nDoes your mom have medical insurance?  It does seem strange to put your mom through a major surgery (where she'll have weeks of recoverey) to get through the Christmas holidays.   Why not devote her final weeks to being surrounded by family at home?", "This is the other side of the same situation that's also posted. \n\nYou shouldn't do this as it would be a huge expenditure for little reward.\n\nI've noticed that neither of you gives the amounts in savings so we can better guage.", "I can't call you an AH for wanting to do whatever you can to save your mother. But I don't think you should do this. Surgeons who make these kinds of promises are highly suspect in my view. Please get another opinion on the surgeons suggested surgery. If your mother's doctor thinks it's viable, why is he not offering to do it? Likely because he knows the odds are supremely low of success. They may have overinflated the possibility of success, or you may have misheard it due to how invested you are in the situation.\n\nHowever long your doctor claims she has left is only a guess. If she is that ill, the surgery alone might kill her. She would spend her remaining time recovering from the surgery. Is that really what you want? Surgery is always dangerous, and it can be painful. Recovery can be extremely draining. If you want to have Christmas with your mother, move Christmas up. Spend your time and money creating memories now instead of possibly wasting a lot of money on a false hope that could take her from you faster.\n\nYour husband doesn't sound very nice, but he does have a point that the benefit isn't worth the cost. Years? Absolutely, do it. But weeks?\n\nI also think it's slightly hypocritical of you to talk about how money your husband earned before is a part of your joint savings, but you kept this money separate for years. The moment you start claiming money is yours and yours only, you make it a thing. He would have the right to remove his money from certain savings. If you do this, you change the outlook on money from ours to mine versus yours, and you would have no right to complain if this isn't favourable to you in the future. Just something to bear in mind.\n\nYou're in a highly emotional state and desperate to do whatever you can to try to halt the inevitable. But it is inevitable, and you need to come to terms with it. Personally, I wouldn't do it, and potentially waste what time you have left with your mother by having her stuck in surgery and post-op recovery for weeks. Either way, I'm very sorry for what you're going through. It's an awful, unwinnable situation to be in, no matter what you choose.", "I'm not going to call anyone an AH because its a sensitive subject. \n\nI will say though, from a basic emotional and physical side if things, is it worth it? Is the surgery and recovery going to be worth the physical suffering your mother is going to have to go through worth a few months?  Is she even likely to survive the surgery? What is the treatment plan post surgery? What's the recovery time? \n\nEssentially, what will her quality if life be like during those extra few months? \n\nI've recently been through similar and between the doctors, her and our family, we decided that putting her through such a traumatic period when the likelihood was we would just be extending her suffering for MAYBE 2/3 months, wasn't worth it.  We spent the money on a palliative care nurse instead so that she was comfortable for her final months.", "Why don\u2019t you spend the money on making amazing memories with your mum for the short time she has left?\n\nIf she\u2019s well enough then one last holiday to somewhere she\u2019s always wanted to go. Visit a landmark she\u2019s always wanted to see. Eat at a restaurant she\u2019s always wanted to try. Or any other things she\u2019d love to do. \n\nMake memories at the end of her lifetime to last you a lifetime.", "NTA because you\u2019re not being an AH and from the way your husband talks he most certainly is. But with that said, I would personally think really hard about doing the surgery. It\u2019s a couple months extension, it may not be a high quality of life, it may not be successful, and without knowing the actual numbers or financial position you\u2019re in, the sad reality is that money may actually better serve your kids than your mom.", "Yeah, we already read your husband's post. Go ahead and do it since it's your money. Whatever you have left is on you.", "You don\u2019t think it selfish of youto make your mom suffer more don\u2019t you think it ready for you to say bye to your mom she is suffering right now but you want to get the surgery that you continue let her suffer for three more months if I was you I would talk to your mom first to see what she want", "I can\u2019t see how this is real- you can\u2019t be dying and have an operation to give you another couple of months. The surgery alone would kill you, and what doctor would do that knowing the patient is already terminal, and would only gain around a few months ?", "ESH. I saw your husband\u2018s post about this yesterday. Do you really want to extend her life for three more months so she\u2019s around for Christmas? Do you really want her to continue to suffer and not feel well for another three months? I would not want my loved one to go through that. And is it really worth it to spend and deplete almost all your savings when it\u2019s really not going to change the outcome and you\u2019re still gonna have to deal with this after the holidays? I mean it\u2019s your money to do  what you want it\u2019s money you saved before you met your husband like you said you guys have a joint account. But I think you guys had need to have a deeper conversation about what this is really about. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want to see you get false hope and get your hopes up and there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s going to work and keep her here for another three months.

These three years have been the hands-down the most brutal thing I've ever endured, and that's saying a lot -- I have not had an easy road, overall. I know how you feel: scared.\n\nAbout six months before my mom died, it was pretty clear that treatments just weren't working. She did many, many rounds of chemo, radiation, immunotherapy to no avail. However, the doctors kept giving us hope. \"There's no harm in more chemo, it might work. Try this drug instead. This type of tumor is inoperable, but maybe we can find a specialist willing to risk it, etc.\" \n\nYeah, there was harm in it -- a diminished quality of life...but my mom and I didn't want to face facts. She was very sick in the months prior to her death due to the chemo. She was constantly running to appointments to get poked and proded and tested and infused. If she would have skipped it, her last months on earth would have been infinitely easier. I mean, she was already almost three years into a stage IV diagnosis. \n\nLook up a paper called the Stage IV Shuffle. It's about doctors not being clear or realistic about cancer patients' outcomes, because the discussion is uncomfortable (even for professionals). \n\nTake this time and spend it with your mom while she's healthy enough. If her primary oncologist said she's got about a month and that the surgery isn't likely to work, take it at face value.

Everyone who has ever lost someone they love always says I wish we'd had more time. \n\nAs for the husband, its not his mum or his money - he doesn't get a say.

No regrets.", "she did mention her mum wanted to go for the surgery too", "Not as bad as not reading properly", "Unfortunately, my personal experience is that this can totally be real. When my mom had maybe 2 months left to live (breast cancer), she fell & hit her head...It caused bleeding on her brain. The swelling made it so that she wasn't in pain for the first time in almost 2 years and still, the doc wanted to do surgery, remove the top of her skull to relieve the swelling, bring back horrific pain and for the sole purpose of extending her life by 6-8 weeks at best. We actually had to fight to get her out of the hospital and bring her home where she simply got sleepier and sleepier until she stopped waking up. It was all unbelievable and just a nightmare that they seemed to care more about length of her life vs. the quality of life.", "If her money saved from before they were married is her money, then why does she count his money  as marital money?", "Her money saved from before they were married is her money, and his  money saved from before they were married is not?", "Ps: literally nobody agreed with your husband", "I've actually never heard a doctor use the phrase \"so and so much time left\", exactly because it is so unpredictable. Take for example stage IV skin cancer. On average, people live for 8-13 months after diagnosis. But there are people who have lived with it for a decade or more. The only time doctors are sure was right before death - they always knew that it would only be hours.", "Agreed. My grandmother went in, given last rites, made a full recovery lived 10 more years. My aunt was given 3 weeks. She died in 5 hrs.", "Her mom should get to decide for herself in conjunction with the surgeon. We don\u2019t know the specifics about the surgery \u2014 it might be a relatively easy surgery that gives her months of quality life.", "Right, I remember reading that post yesterday! Must be college students doing an experiment or something.", "You could also ask your siblings to contribute, but you'd still take on the lion's share, maybe if the amount was reduced to a degree your husband wouldn't be as opposed to the decision -- that way there is still some money left over for whatever. Although I would consider this as an emergency anyways so it is odd that he seems rather cold and doesn't recognize the value of more time.", "This seems like the emergency you were saving it for. A few months is not long but still a few months. I would do it regardless of his opinion. You will resent him forever if you don't. He'll get over the money spent. You won't get over missing those few more months with your mum if you do not get them.", "> the oncologist said his main concern is that it won\u2019t work\n\nI lost my mom a month ago. THIS really is your answer :(.  If your oncologist doesn't believe that this surgery will succeed. All you are doing is throwing away money and causing pain. There is a specific reason the oncologist feels this way. If you trust the doctor. I'd probably trust his conclusion there.  I've been a nurse for 25 years, I lost my mom a month ago and she had a somewhat similiar situation. And the hard part about all of it. Is that it's a situation money really isn't going to solve. Don't spend the last days with your mom trying to squeeze out more days. Make these days as good as you can. Talk to her, visit with her. Just give her love.", "Sure but what\u2019s the recovery like? It\u2019s time to start looking at quality of life, rather than quantity. One month where she can be made comfortable, or three where she\u2019s in pain from the surgery and can\u2019t get around comfortably. \n\nAnother thing to look at is if Mom\u2019s doing this for herself, or for you? Is she willing to put herself through more trauma and discomfort because her child is desperate for more time?\n\nNAH, but you should absolutely be looking into what kind of life your mom may be facing.", "I would have a pragmatic discussion with the surgeon. Would they do it if it was their family member? Do they think that the recovery is worth the potential benefit? These are questions that nobody here will be able to answer for you except the surgeon and oncologist. I would take their advice rather than listening too much to internet randos. If the procedure is warranted, you are NTA for using personal money.", "Two things to consider: \n\nHow will you feel if you DO give her the money and the treatment does not work? If it does work and you spend Christmas on borrowed time, knowing she will soon die? After she dies? After five years? Maybe when your child needs braces and you cannot afford them? \n\nand\n\nHow will you feel if you do NOT give her the money after she dies? Right after? After five years? Maybe when your child needs braces and you can afford them? \n\nThink it through.\n\nGuilt is hell. ImO it's the worst thing about grief. Good luck.", "Everyone is trying to talk you out of the procedure but I think that they're focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nI work in palliative care, and in my mind I know what a \"good\" death looks like, but realistically it's not always about me.  Sometimes families and patients don't want that.  Some people value holding off on the pain meds because they believe that suffering prepares them for the afterlife.  Some people cannot let go of their independence so they would prefer to lay in their own purulent clothing rather than allowing the nurses to bathe them.  Some families believe that fighting until the end is an expression of love so their elderly mother ends up dying with her hands tied up and a tube up her nose.  And yes, some people will extend painful treatment in order to reach a specific milestone (weddings usually).  In my mind those people might not have a \"good\" death, but it's not up to me to tell them that.  If holding off until a particular milestone is what you and your mother value, even if it might introduce new suffering, then that is your right.\n\nSo with that in mind I think NTA/NAH.  I get why your husband doesn't want to see that money disappear, but it's not his decision to make.  As long as you have a realistic understanding of what that will look like, and the money isn't taking away from your family or your life together, then the decision is yours (and your mother's) to make.", "[removed]", "So sorry for your loss. I lost my mom to AML- by the time we caught it, there was no chance at chemo. It sucks losing a parent.", "That's a good question and it isn't stated in the post that his money from before is marital, so I can't be sure. But it does seem like what's considered their shared funds is in the combined accounts. I would be questioning it more if it wasn't already stated that they're living very comfortably right now and that the money she had stashed away prior was never needed. For all we know, he could've also had funds from before the marriage that they considered to still be his. That being said, you could be right and I didn't take that into consideration initially", "I didn't read it like that. Her husband said spending that money would be a waste and should be used for the kids. The way I see it Op just pointed out that they both make 4x that money and they have enough for the kids, and even if there was an emergency there's another source of money. She isn't saying my money is mine and yours is ours too. But he's basically using the kids as an excuse to tell her it isn't worth to invest her own capital before marriage to try and save her mother now in fear of what-if scenarios happening to the children.", "i just had a coworker go through thin with their mom and it really sucked they did the treatments and all of the stuff recommended she was trying to make it to Christmas. sadly she left us this summer.  the family really regretted not just making sure she had a good quality of time left instead of chasing around doctors appointments and everything.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

We still don't know if that was a mutually agreed factor or not. But you could be completely right and in that case then I feel like it's a bit of a tough situation. I still do find it very cold that op's husband puts so little value on even a little more time with her mother though", "Yeah it sucks. There was a procedure my mom could have had at one point but the doctor believed there was less than a 50% chance that she would even survive the surgery. I honestly wanted her to do it, but looking at how things went. She wouldn't have survived. I kept telling myself she would have. But that was bc I hadn't really accepted how far along she was.
