Everything has been going great until yesterday, when he got a stomach bug from either the food or the water. I'm completely fine despite us both eating and drinking the same thing.\n\nSince this morning, I've been running around the hotel speaking with the staff to try and find some medication and clean water, at his request. We're in a remote area, so it's not the easiest task, but I managed to get one of the staff members to retrieve some stuff at the nearest supermarket.\n\nDuring the whole process, I spoke to a lot of people, all of which asked me if I was sick too. Of course I answered that I wasn't and didn't think much of it.\n\nLater in the day, I brought the medication to my partner in our room. I noticed that he was typing a lot on his phone, so I asked what's up. He showed me a long angry message written to the hotel managers, telling them we were both extremely sick from eating their food and asking for some kind of discount or compensation.\nWhen I told him I already informed the staff that I wasn't sick, he got really annoyed at me, saying now they're going to deny it was their food's fault. I tried to defend myself, answering that I had no way of knowing his plan to ask for a discount in that way, and didn't know he expected me to lie. He answered it was so obvious he didn't think he had to say anything, now his plan is ruined because of me.\n\nI walked away angrily because I just spent all morning trying to help him and the best he could do is get angry and tell me I messed up anyways. We haven't spoken since because I decided to just do my own thing for the rest of the day and let him deal with his problem alone. That said, we have to talk eventually and I'm wondering if I was out of line for leaving him alone while sick, plus messing up his plans for compensation. I'm not expecting any special gratitude for helping him because that's what partners do, but at the very least not getting yelled at. It's not the first time he gets angry at me for not doing things his way. Now I just feel like I messed up again and I'm too stupid to do anything right, plus I'm an asshole for abandonning him.\n\nTLDR: My partner caught a stomach bug while on vacation. I wasn't sick despite eating the same hotel food. I asked the staff for help and mentioned that I wasn't sick. Then my boyfriend got angry because I was supposed to tell them I was sick too so we could get a discount. I got angry at him for getting angry at me.

Youre not a mind reader. Hes being a grumpy brat because hes sick, treated you like youre stupid for *his* lack of communication.

His expectation for you to know what hes up to like some precognitive wizard is completely unreasonable. Dude sounds like a red flag.

He got exactly what he deserves, and you shouldn\u2019t apologize to him whatsoever. \n\nBeing sick can make people act cranky, but that\u2019s an explanation and not an excuse. He should learn that he will need to ask nicely to get help from you and from the hotel staff, when he\u2019s in need of help.", "NTA but your question kinda seems out of of line with your explanation. It sounds like if u were to know his plans beforehand of getting the discount then u wouldn\u2019t have \u201crefused to lie\u201d to the staff. Anyways, u weren\u2019t aware of his plans so he really has no right to say u fucked up", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't sick and the staff could clearly see that. If he planned to use such an obvious lie, he should have told you before you left the room.", "NTA, and do you really want to stay with someone who lies to get a discount?  Like, really?", "Your bf is a huge AH, he is showing you who he is and you'd be smart to take this as the red flag that it is and drop his immature, lying ass.\n\nEveryone with a brain and an ounce of common sense knows that getting 'the bug' is a risk everyone takes when travelling to certain destinations. It's the water mainly, because it harbors a different type of bacteria other people's systems are not accustomed to, hence the poisoning. It's not the resort's fault, or the country's fault, it can happen even if the most drastic sanitization measures are taken. That's the reason such resorts usually have signs everywhere advising you to not drink the water, be careful eating fruit or vegetables that have been washed with tap water, and brush your teeth with bottled water, if possible. Some people take a certain medicine before such a vacation as well, to minimize the risk of getting the bug. So him trying to extort money from the resort is just ridiculous, pathetic and I bet he made the two of you the laughing stock of the resort. Thanks to him, you became those people nobody wants to deal with. He is the reason they put those \"do not use while sleeping\" sticker warnings on curling irons, ffs! I don't think you want to live like this, with him dragging you down with his little money grabbing schemes.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How disgustingly American, this is literally why everyone hates us. You should really tell him their food isn't dirty and it didn't make him sick. Travelers diarrhea is caused by having a shitty gut microbiome. He's a jerk, and instead of writing little emails about getting money off your bill, he could have been responsible and done research on how to avoid travelers diarrhea. You're not in a well off country, and he's trying to shake down the people with far less than him for money back on what was probably already an inexpensive trip for the service provided. Think about who you're with.", "NTA", "I mean, if he told me about his scheme, I would've been uncomfortable lying because it's so obvious I'm not sick.

Neither of us is American and we're staying at some shit hotel run by rich assholes. I don't blame him for being angry overall, just for taking it out on me", "Well, you're certainly acting like Americas. Rich people may own the hotel, but rich people do not work at the hotel. He should be angry at himself and his own failings.", "You might be that kind of American but it\u2019s really narrow-minded to have so much self hate. NTA op but your bf has a lot of red flags"]}
