I was emotional and crying because he got a brand I didn\u2019t like, and I called my mom upset about it. She called my dad and yelled at him and told him he needed to go back to the store and get the correct brand and type. We lived in the county, so not exactly a convenient trip for my father.

Take a photo of what you want next time so we have a visual aid.", "Yea, YTA. You should not have asked him buy those types of products for you.

That is the weirdest statement. It's not like he can say, \" Check out that girl over there. She would be so much hotter if she wasn't wearing a pad.\"  Seriously, I was like, what??", "Honestly, I scrolled to the comments before reading and after I saw this I had to go back. What????

He understands (from before we got together, probably from just being a good person) that it's MY body and I get to deal with it however I like.

There is nothing wrong with asking your partner to pick something up for you.

It's in the ground. No.", "Most guys would try. Mine came back with pads so huge, I could hardly walk in them. But at least he knew the dif between a pad and a tampon.

I would set your bar higher.", "It's reasonable for you to expect a grown man to know how to read.\n\nYou didn't say \"hey, I got my period, can you pick up stuff?\"  You asked for pads.\n\nThe beard line is also stupid AF.

You're not an AH like he is.", "Aside from the fact that I actually sorta do expect men to have a basic understanding of period products if they interact with women, he really didn\u2019t have to understand period products for this errand.
