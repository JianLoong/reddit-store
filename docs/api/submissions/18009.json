The only way we could afford it at the time was if both myself and my parents took out separate student loans (I know, it was a stupid amount of money and maybe I should have rethought that). \nMy parents didn\u2019t have any objections at the time and signed up for the loan.\n\nFast forward about 10 or so years in the future. I had been living at my parent\u2019s after college and was making payments on my personal student loan. I got married and moved in with my wife. At the end of 2020, my mom called me and explained to me that she and my father would no longer be able to make any payments on the ParentPlus loan and that they needed me to pay. At that point they had only been making the minimum interest payment without touching the principal. I started my payments on that loan. For context,the interest amount per month on the loans \nwas $500. My parents offered no financial assistance.\n\nFast forward 3 years and what was once a $65K debt (about half of it sheer interest), is now down to $20K in just principal. Things are a little different now as we have a small child and a mortgage. My wife also went part time due to childcare needs and our discretionary funds are tapped. I haven\u2019t been able to make payments and recently contacted my mom to let her know this.\n\nShe explained to me that even though the loans were in her name she considered it \u201cmy debt\u201d and something I needed to resolve.

Parent plus loans are loans that the *parents* take to pay for college. They are not the responsibility of the student. Parents could have said no - we don\u2019t want to, we can\u2019t afford it, whatever it is.\n\nBut no. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to pay for those loans.", "INFO Okay, just realizing something with the numbers. In the time that they were ostensibly paying back the loan, did they rack up more in interest charges than the original loan itself? So the loan was ballooning under their watch, and when you got it from them, you owed twice as much as they originally borrowed? So you've now paid back much more than the original amount that they borrowed?", "NTA, and apparently people don\u2019t know how parent plus loans work.\n\nYou were 17. Parent plus loans are loans PARENTS take out to help themselves pay for their children\u2019s college. Technically those are not your loans, they never were. You were a minor at the time and your parents did not make any agreement with you or deem it necessary to educate you on their expectations. They, as the adults, understood and agreed to take out loans in their names to help you. They should have thought this through at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s nice you are paying them, but legally it isn\u2019t your obligation. They aren\u2019t \u201cyour loans\u201d. Your parents took out loans to help their underage child and didn\u2019t even have the sense to write out an agreement about it. Now they are backtracking about it and have erroneously categorized these as \u201cyour debt\u201d in their minds. \n\nEspecially after being horrifically negligent paying them and letting the interest get so high!\n\nYou even said yourself:\n\u201cTerms were not discussed . My dad had an aversion to discussing family finances with his kids. He felt it was his responsibility to provide for his kids. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u201d", "NTA. I have zero patience for parents who lead their kids into debt and then play the victim. It's well intentioned but foolish and frankly it skirts close to loan fraud. Those loans are called Parent Plus Loans for a reason - they're for parents who want to help pay for college but don't have money saved. They aren't called Backdoor Fake Student Loans.\n\n1) Legally it's their debt. \n\n1.1) You were 17 and you weren't legally ABLE to enter into the loan.\n\n1.2) They signed the paperwork agreeing to take on the debt and  commiting to pay it back\n\n1.3) The bank wouldn't have extended that loan to you because you weren't credit worthy.\n\n\n2) Morally it's their debt. \n\n2.1) You were 17 and didn't know any better. \n\n2.2) They were adults and were much better positioned to understand the long term consequences of debt.\n\nAs adults and parents it's their job to coach you into a school you can afford, not take out debt a 17 year old would never be allowed to assume and then try to saddle you with it.", "NTA This is apparently am unpopular take, but it's your parents' responsibility to pay it back. You were 17 when this loan was taken out, and it was your parents' decision to do so. There is a reason student loans are capped: it's not reasonable to ask a student to repay more than that.\n\nOn top of this, your parents didn't discuss the potential ramifications of this with you before doing it. You say your dad didn't want to discuss finances with you when you were a kid because he thought it was his responsibility to provide for you, but it's okay that he saddled you with a financial burden of a loan that was designed to be his to pay back? This is on him.\n\nYes, it's great for you to pay it if you can, but you can't. You're paying loads in interest for their choice to take out a loan they couldn't pay back, even if it was for your benefit. All of you should have takes this through before the loan was taken out, but you at least need to talk it through now.", "INFO: Did your parents indicate at the time they took the loans out that they would pay them back? Or did they tell you ahead of time that the loans would be your responsibility?", "You were a kid then and it's understandable that you didn't think long-term about the decision to take all on all that student debt.  Your parents probably should have encouraged you to an alternate path for your education.\n\nBut 10 years have passed and in that time you elected to get married, have a kid, and take out a mortgage---knowing full well you already had all those loans to pay back.  That's no different than any adult over-extending themselves, and you can't claim youth for your bad judgment.\n\nYTA. But this is a good example of why no one should co-sign a loan in the first place.  Your parents will have to pick up the payments because they're on the hook, but this is going to affect not just your relationship with them but also your relationship with your siblings.", "INFO: When they took the parent plus loans out, did you promise you\u2019d pay them back for them? Did they say they were a gift? Or did they just take them out without a discussion?", "The Parent's Plus loan comes before the student loan as part of the FAFSA parents are assigned responsibility. True, your parents are the responsible party however the fact that their payment was $50. per month tells me they are not rich people and paying for the loan that provided your education that you get the benefit of is a hardship for them. Yup, you can abandon the loan and they will have to pay. They signed because they love you and believed that you would pay that money off.   Are you willing to say that your relationship with your parents is only worth 20K?", "NTA. If they took out the loans they need to pay them. It's not your debt legally. It's their job as parents to provide a future for their child. They don't get to back out from a previous arrangement now.", "If the agreement was you pay.... Then you need to pay.  You're parents are right that they would need to do the same for your siblings.", "YTA.\n\nThose loans were taken out for you. Before making a kid, you should have paid your damn debts.", "NAH.  Well there maybe but I can\u2019t tell.  First I would point out that if it is truly a PLUS loan, it is in your parents name.  Not yours.  If it is defaulted, creditors would go after your parents, not you. The legal expectation, at least, is that your parents will repay the loan - unless there is a written contract between them and you stating you will make the payments and assume the liability.\n\nSecond, while you certainly didn\u2019t iron out all the details that you should have when you were 17 and your parents took out the loan, you have an excuse.  You were a kid.  They were adults and one would assume that they would not have taken out the loan if they didn\u2019t understand they would be responsible for repaying it.\n\nOn the other hand, it sounds like your parents have done a great deal for you and your siblings, unless as adults while living with them you were all paying equitable rent and your fair share of all household expenses. And it probably is not uncommon for adults to informally assume their parents PLUS loan debts when they were financially able to do so.  And while you are now facing greater expenses after the birth of your child, they are also probably facing a much more uncertain financial future because their income earning days have ended or will shortly and no matter how much they saved for retirement, it will seem insufficient and the future will be scary.  You have income coming in and will continue to do do. Plus you have the possibility that your income will increase.  They do not.\n\nAs uncertain as financial security is right now and as our parents live into their late 80s and 90s, their retirement is often not secure and children have to step in and help financially support parents.  The best way to avoid your parents having an insecure future that may ultimately cost you, is to protect their retirement.  And that means absorbing the debt they incurred that benefitted you.  For many working adults with aging parents it really is a \u201cpay now or pay later\u201d problem.", "Yta \n\nIt's your debt. Your parents are not responsible for your change in circumstances. You decided to get a mortgage, you decided to have a kid. \n\nLike normally I'd be commenting family should help each other out and suggesting you and your parents go half because it'd help you and maybe not overburden them. But the sheer entitlement from you is why you don't deserve it. \n\nYour mom said no and then you undermined her by going to your dad. The sheer disrespect", "ESH. \n\nOP did nothing different that anyone. Else in that generation. We were all raised with \u201cyou have to go to college to make a good living.\u201d Right, wrong, or indifferent, that\u2019s what happened. \n\nColleges and student loan companies (including the feds) took advantage of kids in that age bracket (yes, KIDS) and essentially required you to mortgage your future. Most of the time, students aren\u2019t even told how much. They\u2019re borrowing or what the payments are. Someone at Financial Aid just says \u201csign here, or you have to drop out of school.\u201d And at that age, you have no idea that\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to work. \n\nThat being said, yeah\u2026OP has since grown up and made some adult moves (marriage, house, etc), and should have taken this debt into consideration\u2026maybe. It sounds like OP took their own loans into account. \n\nNow the parents. A Parent Plus loan is in their name. Always was, and they were the grown ups in the situation. THEY should have understood the loan terms at the time. They also should have discussed all of this with OP, particularly if they wanted OP to eventually assume the debt. \n\nBut let\u2019s be real. The real culprit is that tuition is that high to start with, and these loans exist in the first place. It\u2019s a systemic problem, not individuals taking on more than they can handle or borrowing irresponsibly.", "It really depends on what you guys agreed to when the loans were taken out. Did they agree to pay their portion? If so, then N T A.", "ESH. On one hand, it seems pretty irresponsible of your parents to never explicitly discuss this with you and just slap $50 on these for 10 years. They should\u2019ve spoken up and figured things out with you as soon as you were moving out and in a decent financial situation. \n\nOn the other hand, you mention them only being able to afford a spare $50 a month. Presumably you had some idea finances were tight for them? And you just\u2026left them with potentially thousands in debt for 10 years while you had a baby and got a mortgage? I genuinely can\u2019t imagine doing that to my mom. \n\nLegally, the loans aren\u2019t your responsibility; you could leave them with your parents and effectively force them to pay. But like, do you like your parents? Do you want them in your life? Would you feel bad if nonpayment on this debt ruins their financial future? Lack of communication got you all into this. If you care about each other at all, maybe talk to each other and hash out some sort of payment plan you can both afford.", "OP, NTA.\n\nThe entire financial system that forces people into debt slavery if they want to go to college is TA.\n\nKeep going with the PSLF stuff. It's a long process, but it works. If you are union, talk to your union rep about whether they have resources for you. I was able to get help with the process from a financial advisor who specialized in student loans that was recommended by my union rep. The hard part is getting everything submitted correctly.", "[deleted]", "Editing with additional information to NTA\n\nYour parents paid $50 the bare minimum and then stuck you with the payment 10 years later. At that time and I know it\u2019s hard, was the time to pushback on the payment. \n\nYou took it over and paid it down, it\u2019s their debt. \n\nAs I said, it\u2019s their debt with the lender. They choose to pay only interest for 10 years. \n This isn\u2019t an easy situation for you and good luck.\n\n\n****************************************\nPrior comment before edits:\n\nParent Loans are taken out by parents in their name, it is their debt. If the expectation was for you to pay all or part of that, it should have been discussed at the time of the loans were discussed. I've had friends that their parents took these loans with the agreement that the parents would pay it for x period of time and then the responsibility would put to the child to continue to pay.\n\nFrom the credit bureau standpoint, it's your parents' debt.\n\nWhen your mom told you it was now your time to pay, you guys should have had a discussion with this new arrangement.\n\nOnce you took over the payment, you then needed to budget for it before taking on new debt/cutting work hours. I understand life happens, but you took on the debt payments and your parents moved on from it.\n\nAlso, your parents only paying the interest for 10 years wasn't a smart decision, but maybe all they could afford.\n\nSince not paying would impact their credit and your relationship with them, maybe see if you guys can come to some sort of shared payment for a year or so to get you past this hump.\n\nYour parents paid $6000 a year for 10 years if I'm understanding your post. \n\n\nYour mom may be looking at it that she paid the debt for 10 years and that is a lot. Maybe they accured credit card debt during this time paying it. But they were the ones taking on the debt and should have been able to look at the long-term implications.\n\nFair doesn't need to be equal. Would it be fair for your folks to contribute now?
