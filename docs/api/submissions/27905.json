Sometimes he does bring it up to his nose, he likes to do both ocassionally. I forgot to mention that.\n\nMy (51 M) son (16 M) has a bad habit of smelling his food before he eats them. As in he would just bring it up to his nose, sniff at it before eating. We have asked him multiple times to not do that, and that it's really bad table manners. His excuse is that smelling the food just makes it better before eating.\n\nToday he did the same thing again. We were having dessert, and as expected, he bought it up to his nose to begin smelling it. I lost my temper as I have told him umpteem times before to not do that and asked him what he was doing.\n\nHe said nothing, that he was just inhaling the scent. I reminded him and asked whether he forgot what I had told him about it. He looked rather irritated and said it's none of my business of how he eats.\n\nI told him that it's my house and that if he wants to eat like a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* dog, he has to leave the dining table. He looked shocked and left without saying a word. My wife thinks I was out of order,  but I was just frustrated at how disgusting this habit is and how he doesn't seem to care despite us tellling him so many times before.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696015682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vkwd4/aita_for_asking_my_son_to_stop_eating_like_a_dog/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Many people sniff their food before they take the first bite because it smells good.  Why does it bother you that much that he likes the smell of food. you're the problem here not him.", "YTA. FYI most of the taste of the food comes from the smell.", "YTA I have no idea why this is getting under your skin so much, but maybe it's worth giving yourself a time-out and thinking about it. What you said to him was verbally abusive, and you should apologize.", "Yta for being so dramatic. What exactly is so disgusting about appreciating your food?", "Yta, sounds like he has sensory issues or something and you don\u2019t give AF or lack the basic knowledge on sensory issues and how strong the urges can be. Pretty obviously he does or else he wouldn\u2019t do this every single time he eats. Use your brain.", "YTA \n\nI'm 45yo and still sniff my food. I have a strong sense of smell and I love smelling something delicious as i eat it. \n\nLighten up, Francis.", "YTA. I don't really see what's so rude about smelling his own food. It's not like he's shoving it up his nose or eating with his face in the food like an actual dog. You sound like you have anger issues.", "YTA, wtf was that outburst about? Smelling your food is part of the experience and doesn't make you a dog. What is disgusting about that? Is it disgusting when people smell their wine too?", "YTA.\n\n\u201cThese damn teens today and their food smellin\u2019! Back in my day! You ate what was in front of you or else you\u2019d get punched in the jaw by your father! After he had a few too many!\u201d", "Yta. This is a weird thing to get all upset about! \n\nYou\u2019ve never smelled delicious food, smelled a drink before tasting it, or enjoyed the amazing aroma of cookies or brownies before eating them??? Do you breath in the smell of fresh coffee before taking that first warm sip? \n\nIt sounds like your son enjoys food, enjoys the smell of it, and is savoring eating it instead of just wolfing it down. There\u2019s nothing at all weird or disgusting about what he\u2019s doing, if anything, he sounds like a professional chef in the making. \n\nHis taste buds also might be affected & being able to smell The aroma of the food actually helps him taste it and digest. His olfactory glands might not be working that great from the inside.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with smelling food. God you sound fucking annoying. Leave him alone and work on your anger issues.", "YTA and you need to enroll in anger management classes ASAP. \n\nHow dare you abuse your child like this? How dare you break their spirit this way?

Don't be surprised when your children move out and never call or come for visits.", "YTA  \n\n\nyou are punishing your child for harmless behavior", "YTA.\n\nAs a parent, you need to manage your emotions and role model to your son how to speak calmly and kindly to others\u2014this is even more important than teaching him about table manners and you completely failed.  There was absolutely no need to lose your temper and yell at him like that.  You could easily have just explained to him that his behavior is distracting to others around him and that you would appreciate if he didn\u2019t do that in front of you.  Instead, you lashed out at him as if you were the child in the relationship.  You have a lot of growing up to do if you want your son to become a good person.", "YTA. You sound mean. My teens come into the kitchen and smell the pots I have food cooking in. What's the big idea, Sir??", "YTA\n\nEating like a dog? Dogs don't use cutlery, they lick it up. Your son is NOT EATING like a dog.  It is not the end of the world! I note that you say \"despite us telling him\" whereas your wife is telling you that you were out of order. She's right. You are wrong.", "YTA man - I\u2019m someone who personally smells their food. I still do and I\u2019m a fully-grown man. Its just a sensory need and personal preference thing that some people like to do. I\u2019ve had a few people mention it in my life but no one has ever been repulsed or angry at me for it. Sounds like its just a personal pet peeve of yours, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should take it out on your son. \n\nShow him what a solid male role model who knows how to make up for their mistakes looks like by saying SORRY.", "YTA, have you ever done a tasting? You smell what ever you\u2019re about to put on your tongue. It helps you understand the flavors. Your son is probably onto something smelling the food before eating it. It has no effect on you. Also my dog has never smelled anything before eating it.", "YTA.\n\nMost of the flavor we get from food is actually from our sense of smell. He\u2019s not eating with his fingers or shoving his face in the plate, he\u2019s enjoying the first / most important part of actually *eating*.", "YTA\nSee you at the nursing home.", "[removed]", "How is it disgusting to smell your food? That\u2019s completely normal. You are overreacting and being an ahole to your own son. YTA, big time.

That's a disproportionate reaction to such a simple habit. It's not ideal, but he is not hurting anyone or doing anything bad. What a control freak!", "YTA massively, so for my house, I'll tell you how i want you to eat, basically....wtaf you are a control freak, and you sound like you have slight anger issues. You want your kid to talk to you after he leaves home??? Best work on those now if you do!", "Can you write the part of the story that fits the title? I mean the part where he eats like a dog. I don't know anyone who doesn't smell their food.\n\nYTA.", "My dog and I say YTA. What\u2019s wrong with enjoying the scent of food? If anything it\u2019s a compliment to the cooking\n\nYou\u2019re making a mountain out of a speck of dust losing your temper over this", "I would say comparing your child to a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* animal is 10x worse than having someone smell their food. I don't know how he does it but if it's that offensive maybe you can find a compromise (such as a forkful up to his nose rather than the whole plate). If he's bringing the whole plate up to his nose then I can understand you asking him to modify how he does it.  But....nothing justifies talking to your kid that way.  It's abusive.  You're the adult.  Use your words properly.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - I've never heard of anyone saying that smelling the food before eating is bad table manners. Your outburst at something so trivial sounds like you might need to talk to someone about anger management.", "You're just mean, man.", "YTA\n\nyou have both anger and control issues.  you are alienating your family by behaving this way.  there's nothing rude or weird about smelling your food, you're just angry that he's not doing the thing that you're telling him to do.\n\nand for the record, dogs do not smell their food before they eat it.", "YTA. Have you never seen a single cooking show in your entire life? It's perfectly normal to smell your food.", "Yta, I\u2019m an adult and I also smell my food and drinks. It\u2019s my thing, have always done it and for no apparent reason. Let him be him, he\u2019s not harming anyone.", "YTA, lots of people sniff their food to appreciate it before they eat.", "YTA. If this was my child I would actually be concerned that there's an issue with how he can smell the food once it's in his mouth. The fact that smelling it before actually having it in his mouth makes it taste better sounds like there may be some sort of issue between his mouth and nose.", "YTA... It would be rude if shoved his entire face into the plate of food. Part of tasting food is smelling it. I consider it a very normal thing that a lot of people do. Calm down.", "YTA, I'm an adult and have always loved smelling everything, so I'm wondering how he does it exactly.  My parents' rules were: don't smell anybody else's food, or the serving plate, just your own food, don't lift the whole plate up to your face, don't put your whole face to the table; sit normally, put some on a fork, smell, eat, and no sniffing multiple times very fast like a dog, just breathe in though your nose and then breathe out a couple times, and, of course, no putting food in your nose (I was a weird kid). Hope that helps.", "YTA. How is sniffing his food \"bad manners\".", "YTA. A lot of people with sensory issues smell their food and it\u2019s way more than just one sniff. I sniff every single bite of food I take. I\u2019ve gotten older and more discreet so most people don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s being done, but it took me years to get to that. Him smelling his food is not him acting like a dog.", "YTA. And a control freak.  Half the pleasure in food and wine is the smell which enhances the taste. Ask a sommelier.  Your son might have a good future as one.", "Oh noes he smells the food? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRME> \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChefs do it all the time. \n\nThat's not eating like a dog LOL.\n\nYTA and a controlling one at that.", "YTA...Watch Food Network. All the fancy judges eat like this, it means he is enjoying his food.", "YTA. you\u2019re also the adult and should be setting a good example, not throwing temper tantrums and bullying your kid when he doesn\u2019t pay attention to your stupid rules.", "YTA I always smell several times it kept us from getting sick. Bad food smell increases when cooked.\nYTA", "YTA. How about you calm TF down. Olfactory sense is tied heavily to flavor. You're telling him he's enjoying his food wrong.", "YTA. Massively. How is smelling your food disgusting behaviour? Calm tf down.", "YTA. He\u2019s not hurting anyone at all.", "YTA - what are you going to do next? Put his plate on the floor next to the dog bowl?", "You do know, don't you, that most of the taste you get comes from the smell of the food. That's why you don't taste anything when you have a cold. \n\nYour son could have even less taste than normal and smelling the food gives him the taste of it. Or he discovered by himself that smell makes up most of the taste. If he is sniffing loudly then he should learn to be discreet, but there's nothing wrong with smelling your food. \n\nYTA. The only problem is that you find it annoying and you decided that he had no right to do it.", "YTA big time. I hope you take time to reflect on why this is something you even care about, much less something that drove you to treat another human that way. \n\nThe your house/your rules thing is tired. He is your son, you are responsible for putting a roof over his head. Sheltering him does not give you the right to control his every move. Please don't dim your kid's light.", "YTA. Man you need anger therapy. To be this triggered from something so innocuous, wow. Even calling it disgusting is a stretch. He isn't sticking it up his nose and he isn't faceplanting the plate. Smell is a component of taste. He is completely right. I might even try doing that.", "YTA. Go ask a chef if he'd like it if people took a moment before diving in to lift the plate or lower their face to the plate to get a good whiff. Most will say that's part of the experience. Your son might have a better olfactory sense and a shitty sense of taste, so smelling it enhances the taste for him. Your son isn't eating like a dog. He's eating like a person that likes the smell of things. WTF is wrong with you?", "YTA. It's not like he's smelling shit at the dining table. He's smelling food. You prepatred the food. Food is not gross. Food is nice. Its smell is nice. What's wrong with smelling nice things? You're basically just killing his joy for the sake of it. Just because you want to show him who is superior in this house. The whole \"it's my house\" argument is such a shitty thing to say to your child. Like what's more important to you, a house or a living person who has feelings? Are you aware that what you say has consequences? Don't be shocked if it turns out your son develops anxiety or other mental problem or if he wants nothing to do with once his able to live on his own.", "YTA, you should of taken your own advice and left the dining table too because screaming and swearing at someone (a child no less!!) is most definitely not good table manners \n\napologize to your teenage son and maybe you\u2019ll be put in a good nursing home", "YTA. Can't imagine comparing a kid to a \"fucking dog\" because he likes the smell of food.", "YTA. I was expecting him to put his face in his food and eat it without his utensils or hands, but just sniffing it? Let him do his thing.", "Yta, he wasn't shoving handfuls of food into his mouth, locking the plate, or anything actually gross.", "YTA- leave him the fuck alone Jesus Christ. The dude is just enjoying his meal in a way that literally doesn\u2019t impact anyone else. You need to chill and mind your business", "YTA\n\nNothing you described sounds rude or inappropriate at all. I was expecting a description somewhat akin to that scene in Matilda with Bruce Bogtrotter and the cake. \n\nAlso, I feel like you've never seen a dog eat, because my dog would never waste time sniffing food before eating it.", "YTA. He isn\u2019t harming anyone. Leave the table for enjoying food. Big boomer energy.", "YTA, what is your problem? The smell is part of a culinary delight. He is not doing anything bad.", "YTA. There's nothing weird in smelling is food. If a food has a appealing smell,  chances are it will be pleasant to eat. And the inverse is also true. So let your kid smell is food. And I garantee you, most dogs nibbles everything without even smelling it. Quite like you!", "YTA what??? Why is it rude??? You just fabricated this offense and then dropped the f bomb on your son. Maybe you should take a look at your own table manners. Pretty sure that was a lot more rude than your son sniffing his food. Seriously hypocritical and brash. Such an extreme overreaction. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Yeah, YTA. Your son is just being a kid, he will likely grow out of doing that. And even if he doesn't, this is at best an eccentricity, not a crime. What's your fear around him wanting to smell his food?  That it's not \"good manners\"? It's not like he's giving others a show of what's in his mouth by chewing with his mouth open.\n\n\nThe bigger issue is that you'd rather push your kid away rather than understand him, or better yet, even support him. You can explain to him that some people may find that weird, but at the end of the day, you're his parent and he's not commiting any crime. Have your kid's back. Be loyal to your little weirdo. That will mean more to your relationship with him, both in the short and the long term, than any issue over food smelling.", "YTA. Period", "Yta,  yikes,  this is the hill you want to kill the relationship with your son on??", "YTA but I'll accept that you're just a bit ignorant in this area.\nObserving/looking over, and inhaling the scent of the dish prior to consuming is actually considered very good manners in many cultures, as it shows consideration and appreciation for the food, and therefore, the people who prepared it. \nAlso, it's basic science. Smell & aroma contribute greatly to our taste perception.\nThere is nothing wrong with considering your food, as long as they're not shoving it up their nose, taking overly loud/exaggerated snorts, picking or poking at the food.", "YTA. He's sniffing his food. Who tf cares?", "INFO: What kind of sniffing are we talking about here? Is he puffing in and out through his nose rapidly, actually like a dog? Or is he just sniffing it once or twice, getting the aromas and savoring this food?", "If this is real YTA and you need to take a real look at your anger and control issues.\n\nMany people smell their food to determine whether they'd like it or not, it's not disgusting unless he is shoving it up his nose and snorting at it.", "YTA - would you rather he puts the plate on the floor while he sniffs it?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a sensory thing for him before he eats, maybe he is being an annoying teenager. Bringing the plate to his face seems more polite than bringing your face to table height to smell it. \n\nSome people burp and fart to show appreciation for the cooked food. Sniffing seems harmless in comparison.", "YTA I get paid at my job to smell food to check it's right for consumers. This is normal behaviour.", "You said it\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d\u2026 why do you think that? He isn\u2019t actually sticking his nose in it, right? So what\u2019s disgusting about it?", "YYA.

So not only are you wrong,  YTA", "YTA. regardless of whether or not you think it's appropriate to do at the table, there's no reason to embarrass him about it. if it really bothered you you could've had a private talk about it. or internally address why it bothers you so much and don't put that on a child", "YTA ffs.

However, that is a \u201cme\u201d problem. My boyfriend does this and especially so with certain foods but since he\u2019s not chomping with his mouth open and has been more mindful of the volume of it, I do my best to tune it out because he can\u2019t really help it.

No big deal, good food is supposed to smell good to get our appetite going.\n\nEnter your weird issue and complaints. Your kid now knows that it bothers you, and because he's a dorky teen, he's going to try to push your buttons (ie continue bothering you) by doing the very thing that bothers you as often as he can and in the most annoying way possible. In short, every time you complain, you're encouraging him to keep doing it just to annoy you.\n\nStop giving him a platform for his behavior, and ignore it instead. Once he knows he's not going to get a rise out of you he'll likely stop because that power he held over you will be gone.", "YTA - yikes.

My guess is that you are less concerned with his quirk than you are with thinking he is going to do this outside the home and other people are going to think he is weird or strange and THAT is what is causing your stress. You want to protect him from ridicule and the consequences of that etc. \n\nI am going through the same thing with my son. My husband, his father, died when he and his twin sister were 6 and I have major issues around that \n\nIt has caused my son to become withdrawn socially and he went from outgoing to socially awkward. He had a lot of behaviors, quirks and attitudes that really are off putting. I find myself reacting in anger because I worry so much and sometime I feel like if he would just not do these odd things then he could make friends. I have definitely snapped and said things I wish I could take back. \n\nBut guess what? Those are my issues not his. It's not for me to try to make him be someone he is not.

Not like \"oh I want them to be my friend\" to the point they don't respect you as a parent. I managed both. She talked to me about everything, sex, drugs, and everything in between. (She tried pot once with my knowlage, didn't drink until she was of age and still doesn't much care for it, hard no on other drugs and was 19 before she was ready for intimacy) I was always straight forward with her about these things (sex is awesome when you are with the right person for the right reasons and only you and no one else can make decisions what you do and don't do with your own body. Drugs might be fun but it's Russian roulette with your life, etc etc) \n\nDo some soul searching. Figure out why you are really mad and then go talk to your son. \n\nGood luck.

Your son appears to be developing a very sophisticated palate, he obviously wishes to savor and enjoy his food. You are fully in the wrong and might actually be exhibiting the eating 'style' you are attributing to your son.\n\nEating is a multi-sensory experience as explained by Kitchen Theory and every other culinary expert.\n\nEating offers us both sustenance for survival as well as hedonistic pleasure. It is an intensely sensory experience and most importantly it is one of the most multisensory activities we as humans engage in multiple times per day. Our expectations, judgements and enjoyment of food and flavour are all formulated in our minds based on sensory inputs (what we see, smell, taste, feel and hear). And while we mainly associate flavour with our sense of taste (salty, bitter, sour, sweet and umami) and our sense of smell, research shows that flavour is really a multisensory construct of all our senses coming together in a congruent manner.\n\nMany cultures have a phrase along the lines of \u201cyou eat with your eyes\u201d and most of us understand the importance of the visual presentation of food, but the other senses can get a little lost. Take sound for instance; the sizzle of a steak platter, crack of a cr\u00e8me brulee sugar crust or crunch of a tempura coated shrimp are all \u2018audio flavour\u2019 cues your brain picks up and makes judgments based upon. Texture (as well as associated mouthfeel and temperature) is one of the most determining factors in regard to how much we will enjoy an ingredient or dish, this is particularly true for children but applies to most adults too.\n\nFood should be a feast for all of our senses, something your son appears to instinctively know and appreciate. You, on the other hand, come across as rather boorish in your approach to dining and also family matters.\n\nYTA. Your wife is correct, you were, and are, out of order.
