My mum calls me and asks if she could wear an outfit of mine to some work party I think. I was like which one? She was describing this dress that I have only wore once and it\u2019s so pretty and one of my faves. I\u2019ve been wanting to wear it again but an occasion hasn\u2019t occurred. I say no you cannot wear it. She says please and that everyone will be wearing something really nice. I was firm on the no and told her if she wants to wear something nice then go buy something. She\u2019s like but I don\u2019t usually wear these outfits. I said that\u2019s not my problem and DO NOT wear it.\n\nAbout a week or two later, I come home for Christmas and at first I forgot about the whole thing. I open my cupboard and see my layout of clothes is a little different. Btw I have a thing about people touching and moving stuff around while I\u2019m not there. Like it feels like spiders are crawling all over my body or something idk how to explain it. Anyways, then I saw some glitter from my dress on my bed. I went down to confront her and she completely denied it. I asked 3 times and she still lied so I gave up and went to bed.\n\nNext day after she comes home from work I don\u2019t try to make any conversation. She asks what\u2019s wrong so I tell her \u201cyou wore my dress\u201d and just stare at her. She gives in and says my dad said she can wear it. I repeated that I said no and that she lied right to my face. She didn\u2019t exactly apologise, like she said sorry once in an insincere way. She keeps trying to talk to me normally and I ignore her. She then starts talking loudly to my dad in the other room \u201coh (dad\u2019s name) what am I going to do? What can I possibly do to fix this? I didn\u2019t commit some huge crime\u201d Then she asks are you not going to talk to me and I said up don\u2019t really feel like talking to you right now. Then she asks \u201coh so you\u2019re never going to talk to me in your life ever again?\u201d I sigh and leave the room. My parents keep talking like it\u2019s no big deal and get over it, and that my dad said she can wear it.

If your Mom felt she had the right to borrow your dress, then she shouldn't have asked permission and just worn it.  Not that it would have been right, but she would at least be owning the fact that she doesn't respect the dress as your property.  Saying your Dad gave her permission is just another way to dodge owning her behavior.  I think the mind game of pretending to respect something as belonging to you,  and then disregarding you not wanting her to wear it would annoy me more than the fact she wore the dress."]}
