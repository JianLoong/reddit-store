I do have friends with kid(s) that are around my daughter's age and I always ask her how she liked the visit and if she had fun playing with whoever we visited.

All the bruises and injuries I recieved at daycare were because I was \"clumsy\" and I \"was lying for attention\" when I said so and so hits me. My mother did nothing to protect me from all the bad things that happened to me at that daycare. It was so bad that I never put my child in daycare or let anyone other than family watch her because of my trauma. My mother didn't do anything until one of the girls told her parents that I had threatened to murder her. There was a big to do among the adults and my mom got pissed because she knew it was a lie. That was when she finally pulled me from that after school care and instead sent me to her friends house after school and changed my elementary school to be the same one her friends daughter attended. I was in 5th grade (edit: 11 years old, i attended that daycare from birth with the same group of girls) when she finally pulled me out of that abuse. This occurred all through the 90s.

This makes me so mad. \n\nAnddd your mom friend ended her friendship over her daughter\u2019s and your mom couldn\u2019t end it over the bullying?", "Wow, she dropped a 20 year friendship because her daughters, whom you haven't spoken to in years or you weren't even friends with, weren't invited. If it wasn't for this, it would have been something else down the line. NTA, console your mom as best you can and remember this is not your fault", "esh i dont understand wtf these acronyms are for lmao  \nthis sub is pretty awful trying to justify all the actions of the poster or bring divine judgment on it  \nlook at the facts. u made ur mom lose her lifelong friend. u were afraid to reach out to ur bully even though its been years.  \nthats all there is to it. what do u mean should u have invited them? if you mean the possible repercussions, she either apologizes to you or shes still a dick. u are 26 with a 29yr husband, u should be more than enough of an adult.  \nlike u repeatedly told ur moms friend u hate her guts (did u invite my daughter no why would i) cuz u were scared she would sabotage the wedding or smth. i think ur relationship with ur mom is really fragile if u thought she wouldnt be on ur side if something bad happened at ur wedding.  \nu should send your mom your exact post so she knows what happened, then she might feel less bad if she knows about how much u got bullied in the past. best solution since her friendship is over anyway but idk if u care for her much lmao.", "YTA ESH", "I find it odd how megan wants to be invited to the wedding too. Is the groom a high-status man or sth? I mean, if megan thinks she can find connections for her career advancement she might want to be there. I might be reaching here but it sounds weird that she wants that invite so strongly.", "NTA. Penelope needs a hobby to get this worked up over a wedding.", "NTA. Penelope is the AH for thinking people you've had no contact with since high school should be invited to your wedding,  AND for holding your mother accountable for it when it wasn't your mother's decision.\n\nMy BFF and I have grown children. We met when our older girls were in kindergarten together, and we were all fast friends until they were in junior high. Something changed and they just suddenly weren't friends anymore. I heard my daughter's side of it, and I'm sure she heard hers, but we sat down and agreed to let the girls deal with it. Be there for them, of course, but we agreed not to try to force them to be friends if they weren't feeling it, and not to let it interfere with our own friendship. Period.", "Penelope is in denial and you don\u2019t have to do anything!! NTA", "How on Earth does inviting someone who bullied you to one of the greatest days of your life make any logical sense whatsoever especially just to appease your mom? ABSOLUTELY NTA HERE", "NTA and Penelope had no right to pressure your mom in the way she did.  A friend would have respected the decision and understood that it was your choice, not your mom\u2019s. Why would you want to have these people at your wedding?  Why would your mom, knowing how bad the bullying had been, try to convince you to include them?", "NTA.  You don't owe anyone or their children an invitation to your exclusive event, let alone someone who hurt you.", "NTA \n\nBully\u2019s mom gives insight on bully.", "Nta. It's an easy answer. You aren't close to her girls so you didn't invite them.", "OP says her mother didn't know the extent of the bullying. That's normal, I think. When you go home,  you just want to forget about it all and feel safe.", "It doesn't seem like Megan is the one who wants the invite - it's just her mother who's been pushy. I would bet that Megan doesn't give a damn either way.", "NTA what the hell your mom was thinking op ? bullying could cause severe damage to anyone exposed to it. fuck friendships, you dont exist to suck it up for something that caused you harm.", "NTA. Sounds like Megan learned her bullying tactics from her mother.", "So why is it that Penelope doesn\u2019t know the true extent of the bullying? The first thing your mom should have done when she realized it was to tell Penelope what was going on. Because it just not about protecting you but letting your best friend to get a handle on her child before it\u2019s too late. \n\nNTA for inviting but I think your mom had a responsibility to handle this better.", "NTA. Nothing requires you to invite the children of your mother's friend when you haven't seen either of them for years and one was a massive bully.  You mother's friend had an invitation. Its totally her issue if she decides to cut off your mother as a friend, when in fact your mother had no part in the decision not to invite them.", "NTA\n\nThe apple didn't fall far from the tree then. Sounds like Penelope was just as awful as Megan...Still you can tell your mum this was a tiny taster of what you went through growing up.", "NTA. But your mom is for not stopping her friends kid from bullying you.", "This but also sorry, but why even invite Penelope? I get it she is Op's mum's friend but it's Op's wedding... I think it was already nice from op to do that. I did not invite my parents' friends to my wedding", "reach out? have you ever considered the fact that people don't want their bullies or abusers present in their happiest, most meaningful moment in their live?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni wouldnt have cared if they apologized, they aint coming to the wedding.", "NTA.  Now we know where Megan learned her bully tactics.", "Why did your mom\u2019s friend even think it was ok to ask for you to invite HER kids? An invite is an invite and she overstepped by insisting her brats get to come. Sounds like we know where her nasty kid gets her habits from.\n\nAlso why should you continue to pay for her mean kid? Nope. You are totally in the clear here!", "NTA I just don\u2019t understand how your mom was ok with being friends with the mother of a child who bullied you. I guess willful ignorance is a real thing.", "Nta, but your mom is. She personally  knew the mother of the girl that tormented you, and didn't stop it.  Also we see where the tormentor gets her attitude  from.", ">My mom said it\u2019s okay and isn\u2019t upset with me but I can tell she is still hurt by the loss of her lifelong friend.\n\nIf that is what it took to break the friendship, they weren't that close imo. I think she is reeling from the fact that her kids were SO bad to you that they didn't get an invite. She probably can't handle that it was that bad and is making you guys out as bullies. NTA", "NTA \n\nPenelope was  never that good of a friend if your mom couldn't tell her about the bullying in addition to the lack of invitations for her daughters.", "Also, I think we can see where Megan got her lovely personality.", "Seeing a definite pattern from the relatively small amount of info provided: It\u2019s important to op\u2019s mum that she be friends with Penelope, but Penelope doesn\u2019t care about what\u2019s important to op\u2019s mum *or* her family"]}
