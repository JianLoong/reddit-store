I (26F) recently married my husband (29M). My mom (50F) has been friends with Penelope (50F) for over 20 years and we also used to live in the same neighbourhood. Penelope has two daughters, Megan (28F) and Clara (22F).  \n\nAs kids, Megan was always terrible to me. And I don\u2019t just mean typical childhood drama. She would tell me how when she grew up she would move away and never talk to me again because I was stupid and she hated me, how I was such a loser and nobody liked me, and even pulled nasty pranks on me. I had a crush on a boy once and she wrote a fake confession letter from me to him making me out to be a creep and gave it to him and from that point on *nobody* in my grade talked to me for several years because they all thought I was a freak. She really wanted to be popular and found all of this amusing. At first when we were little my mom forced me to play with her thinking she\u2019d grow out of it but as preteens when things got worse she stopped forcing me over to Penelope\u2019s and Megan and I distanced.  \n\nIt was always Megan\u2019s dream to move to a big city and work for a famous magazine company, and she did just that.

I don\u2019t think her mom ever realised the extent of how terrible Megan made me feel growing up.  \n\nWhen I got engaged to my now husband of course my mom invited Penelope. Penelope kept asking if I had invited Megan and Clara but why would I? I hadn\u2019t heard from either of them in years. Penelope kept pushing it and at first my mom suggested just forwarding the invitation to them but I didn\u2019t want to.

My mom said it\u2019s okay and isn\u2019t upset with me but I can tell she is still hurt by the loss of her lifelong friend. Also, I definitely had the accommodations to invite Megan and Clara. Should I have just invited them anyway?  \n\nAlso, before anyone asks about Clara: we were never close since she was always a bit younger than me as kids, though I did babysit her sometimes.

I just didn\u2019t want her there since she treated me so rudely and has not bothered reaching out to me in years. And because I didn\u2019t invite her, her mom has gone no contact with my mom.

NTA.\n\nHow does your mother feel anyway? It's okay to grieve the loss of a relationship; just because she is grieving doesn't mean she believes you are in the wrong. She can be disappointed in her former friend and simultaneously be sad because something she enjoyed in her life no longer is.", "NTA. Penelope thinks her daughters never did anything wrong, because she's mad that you won't placate them. She's completely ignoring your feelings and being a bully herself.\n\nSo Penelope can shove it.", "NTA no you shouldn't have invited her and the problem with your Mom's and Penelope's relationship is between them. They'll fix it or not, but you aren't responsible or capable of fixing it.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Penelope was a terrible friend. She decided to drop your mom for this? She was never a good friend to begin with. If you want, you can try to connect with Penelope and explain why, but I wouldn't bother.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI am curious as to whether anyone actually told Penelope why her demon daughter wasn't invited.  From what you've written, it doesn't sound like it would do any good.  I feel for your mother but perhaps it's been a while coming.  Sounds like there are a lot of similar traits in that family.", "NTA if anything your mom is the AH for forcing you to interact with your bully for so long so she could have fun with her friend. She put her want for friendship above your safety and well-being for years and has no remorse.", "Penelope is punishing your mom for Penelope's unwillingness to parent her own child. very sad. NTA", "NTA. Her mom's attitude is the reason why her daughter grew up to be a bully. She's willing to drop years of friendship with your mom. You aren't close with her daughters at the very least and at most, her daughter was a nightmare towards you. There is no need to invite them. Hell, there was no need to invite her. It was your wedding.", "NTA. You had a choice to invite her and didn\u2019t. You weren\u2019t being rude or anything, just didn\u2019t want to see them after what they did to you.

Penelope was so upset that you didn't invite her daughters to your wedding that she didn't go and has stopped being friends with your mother.

You can see where Megan learned to be so horrible.\n\nAlso, why would your mom stay friends with a person whose child is tormenting you?  Why didn't she talk to Penelope about it and get it to stop.\n\nYou did nothing wrong here and hopefully, your mom will see she's better off without this person.", "NTA. And I cannot understand Penelope\u2019s view at all. None of these people are children. It\u2019s not like a birthday party in elementary school.", "Right? It was a power move.

Even if you had the room for extra people, you didnt owe invitations to people not in your life and to an old bully  Nta", "I\u2019m pretty sure your mom was being bullied and just thought that was how friendships were suppose to be.", "Seriously. OP is NTA. Penelope sounds like a nightmare. She was only invited due to being mom's friend and being around OP intermittently. If her kids weren't around for years, even if one hadn't been a bully OP was under no obligation to invite them. Weddings are expensive. Invites are not required for everyone you've ever met.", "My mom became friends with 3 other families when my siblings and I were in preschool. A bunch of us were in the same grades. 4 out of the 8 kids have gotten married. None of the kids were invited to any of the weddings, but all the parents were. No fighting, we all just drifted apart.", "Regardless, OP's mom is also an asshole because how could you tolerate someone treating your kid like that for so long? Sure, she wasn't mad at OP about it but simply asking to forward an invitation is way too much given how that person treated OP.", "Yeah that is what I was thinking. No way I would let it slide. I do have friends with kid(s) that are around my daughter's age and I always ask her how she liked the visit and if she had fun playing with whoever we visited. If she says no, I will ask why and gage from there. But so far, my friends are all decent people with kind hearted kids. Never had an issue so far. My daughter is 3 years old so I know it may happen later but I know she would tell me and I would nip it in the bud. I hope to always be able to be there for her.", "Agreed.", "Seriously, like the mom is an asshole for prioritizing this friendship over her kid", "NTA \n\nBut I do think that your mother is an AH.\n\nShe valued a friendship over protecting her own child, and IMO that makes her a horrible mother", "NTA. Your mom made a choice long time back to be friends with the mother of your bully. It is payback time !", "NTA even without the bullying, there wouldn't be anything wrong with inviting Penelope and not the daughters.

She may not have grown out of that stage.", "NTA", "NTA. Even if you take the bullying out of the equation, you haven't spoken to either Megan or Clara since school, neither made any effort to contact/congratulate you, and the only relationship from that period is the one between your mum and Penelope. \n\nYou had no reason to invite them to your wedding, and you invited Penelope as a courtesy because she was your mum's friend. I'm sorry that a former friend of your mother's has stopped speaking to her, but this wasn't your fault.", "NTA and worrying about what you could\u2019ve done different doesn\u2019t serve you any good. Your mom dodged a bullet here if her friend was dropping her over something like thjs", "NTA, Penelope is overreacting and very entitled.", "NTA. A wedding costs so much money and time to plan. Why would you invite people you don\u2019t care about, especially a former bully, to your special event?", "NTA \nBut Penelope,  Megan and (Sorry to say so) your mom are TAs.", "NTA.\n\nThis woman bullied you and has had no contact with you for years. Why would her mother feel entitled to try and invite her child to someone else's wedding, particularly in these circumstances? Frankly Penelope in TA.", "NTA. Penelope is trying to emotionally blackmail you into inviting her daughters to your wedding by hurting your mother. *She's just as much of a bully as Megan*. \n\nThe apple didn't fall far from the tree. Your mother is better off now. She will feel sad she has lost a friend, but it sounds like she knows it's not your fault.", "> So, here is where I think I might be TA.\n\n*literally nothing happens directly involving OP*\n\nNTA", "OP is definitely NTA and the Mom is. I\u2019m sorry OP but it sounds like your Mom has a long history of not validating your emotions or needs. \n\nIf I had gone through them, the experiences with this other girl would have been very traumatic. I\u2019m guessing they were for you too. When I was young just about the most important thing to me was how other kids felt about me, and I was super sensitive to rejection. I can\u2019t imagine having an entire grade full of classmates turn against me. \n\nYour Mom prioritized her friendship with this other woman over the needs of her daughter, and she\u2019s still doing the same thing. I don\u2019t know OP but I am sure there are a lot of other examples of this, and this is not an isolated incident. Speaking from experience because this sounds like something my Mom would pull. \n\nStick to your guns OP. Your feelings matter. It\u2019s you and your partners special day and nobody else\u2019s. I would never want somebody there who reminded me of shitty, potentially traumatic childhood experiences. That trumps any superficial friendship your Mom has.", "Or that perhaps she\u2019s a bully like her daughter and trying to make a power play. Either way, your mom is better off without her. Even an invite for Penelope (and not her daughter) was already very kind of you because she\u2019s not your close friend."]}
