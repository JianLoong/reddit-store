How much of your anxiety around dealing with phone notifications is tied to your mothers demand for attention from you? Do you feel the need to reply to every message right away?

I'm going to assume it was in defense of your fiance that you cussed at you mother.  But you were right to leave and draw the line.

That shot would have been devastating unchecked", "She would hate me. During the workday, only calls/texts from my office and coworkers go through. It\u2019s completely on DND at night and nothing will go through at all. The only exception was last summer when my neighbor had heart surgery, so his calls were on the list to go through 24 hours a day, and that has changed back since he\u2019s doing better.

I grew up long before cell phones and the internet and if you weren\u2019t physically present in the house with the landline you missed all the calls and we all did fine. Even before voicemail! No one is obligated to respond instantly or to every text/call/email. Period.", "NTA", "ESH. You and your mother are long overdue for an adult discussion about boundaries and expectations. You have reasons for leaving your phone on DND, which is fine in terms of meeting your needs, but it isn't meeting your mother's needs. \n\nI trained my (equally dramatic and boundary challenged) mom to have a regularly scheduled weekly phone call with me, where we chat for half an hour in real time. There might be an occasional E-mail or letter by snail mail. It's manageable. But I didn't achieve this by skipping out on calls, using DND, or telling her to F off. I did it by explaining my desire to balance her need for contact and undivided attention with my need for uninterrupted concentration and study time. Help yourself to this strategy if you wish.\n\nYour mother is really not handling herself in a mature way and should be old enough to know better. The snarky remark about your partner's abusive past was gauche and hurtful, yet it sounds to me like it's her fear talking. She is dealing with this fear in an immature way that may end up pushing you away and creating the exact thing she wants to prevent. Have the two of you had a deep, real conversation about what might change in your relationship over time? Are there some things you want to make sure you don't lose?", "ESH. Do you hear yourself?", "considering what her mom is like, I'm more than sure she was, in fact, not raised better than that."]}
