YTA because you\u2019ve shown your daughter you don\u2019t want her while you step in and raise someone else\u2019s kid. Of course she would want nothing to do with you or your new family. Leave your daughter alone and let her live her life. Not everyone needs to be invited to parties. Why don\u2019t you do stuff with your stepson next time your daughter throws a party? That way he gets to do something with you and your daughter is happy.", "YTA why would she want ANYTHING to do with him when you made it clear she wasn\u2019t wanted by you?", "OP - I'm not sure of all the circumstances surrounding your daughter other than you apparently didn't want her, and that was your choice. It seems to me that you have another choice in this mess that you seem to have created. Move to another town so your stepson cannot worry about the consequences of your choices.", "I don't know how the ice cream thing works. She wheeled in a bunch of tubs and went around to every single class with enough bowls and spoons for everyone to have ice cream first period before it melted?\n\nAnyway, YTA. I guess excluding people isn't nice, but I don't think not inviting someone to a party is even bullying. I assume since you don't talk to your daughter that you're stepson's report everyone but him was invited is possibly exaggerated. YTA for trying to make a child who doesn't talk to you (that you avoided adding why) do something for the kid you care about. She doesn't HAVE to include someone she doesn't like when she gives things or throws parties.", "YTA \n\nI was on your side kind of until the comments. You have not been a mother to this girl ever.  You didn\u2019t want her but now are happily raising another child who isn\u2019t your own - do you know what that tells your daughter? Your stepson is unfortunately being excluded from her life like you\u2019ve excluded her.  I\u2019m sorry but there is not a simple fix here and it is entirely your fault.", "OP, I\u2019m not sure you are going to get what you need from this forum.\n\nI\u2019m giving you the benefit of the doubt because I know too many people who have birth due to societal expectations and controlling partners. It\u2019s not as simple as many think to completely sever maternal rights, especially in countries (and states) with limited access to abortion and other women\u2019s rights.  It\u2019s also not unusual to have complex emotions about a child you wouldn\u2019t have chosen to have, nor is it unusual to get physically away from someone only to have them find other ways to mentally connect themselves to maintain power, often through shared children. It\u2019s easy to say what everyone should do in that situation from a place where every option is available and the person going through it isn\u2019t mentally broken and/or beaten down.\n\nAll that said, even if you are and have always actively chose to be a horrible parent to your daughter, she has no right to take those feelings out on your step son. While those feeling would be understandable they would be misdirected. \n\nNo matter the full story your stepson isn\u2019t the one responsible here.\n\nI have no idea if are an A in real life. It sounds like at the very least you didn\u2019t always make the best choice out of the bad options available. It also sounds like even if you made the best choice for yourself that choice came with hurting your daughter. You need to accept the consequences of that when it comes to her feelings towards you and your family.\n\nHowever, when it comes to what you are specifically asking,  which isn\u2019t about her feelings but about her actions, you are NTA.", "I don't think this is the right forum to be asking your question, OP. You're only going to face judgement for not being a perfect mother by internet strangers that are incapable of understanding nuance.\n\nBased on what you said in the comments, NTA. Your ex is, though. Forcing pregnancy on you when you were clear you didn't want it is abuse, pure and simple. Your daughter was of course not to blame for any of this, but it's understandable that you would have complicated feelings for her and feel unable to raise her with the unconditional love a kid deserves. I hope you've since gotten help and been able to heal from the trauma of what that awful man did. \n\nAs for the current situation, I'm not sure what can reasonably be done about this. Your daughter is angry at you for not being there for her and she's taking it out on your son, who she clearly considers her replacement. It's not right at all, but her feelings are understandable. If she lives with your ex full time then it's more than likely he's been doing what he can to poison her against you and it might takes years to reach through to her and help her understand the reality of who her dad is and what he did to you both. It might not ever be possible. Imo the best thing you can do right now is to be there for your son. Teach him that sometimes people will hurt you because they're hurting themselves, and it's not a reflection on your self worth. It might also be a good idea to talk to the teachers at school and see if anything can be done to separate the two. Maybe one of them can be moved to a different class?", "This is not bullying. Just he is not included. If you want this problem solved, move the stepson to a different school.YTA", "OK, I will go for NAH because I do understand you and your daughter but honestly it would not be absurd to say that you are both A... \n\nWhat you ex (the dad) did is sexual abuse in some countries and I do agree with theses countries. I strongly believe that becoming a parent should be a choice and you didn't have the opportunity to make that choice. The only choice you had left was to becoming a mother or giving up your daughter.  One was bad for you, the other was bad for your daughter, and I won't blame you for the choice you made. \n\nI also agree that what your daughter is doing could end up isolating your stepson for something he didn't do. \nBut I do also understand why your daughter is doing that.\n\nAnd honestly it does not look like you understand your daughter POV and you should try to understand her a bit more. She should also probably get some help from a professional to talk about how she feels. it could help her.\n\nBut unfortunately no matter what you do it's probably not going to change how she feels about you and how seeing your new family might hurt her... \nSadly it's the kind of situation where I don't see any ending where nobody get hurt...", "Anyone  else bored with all these fake stories?", "You exclude your daughter from your family so she excludes your replacement child. It\u2019s only fair.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\n1) You didn\u2019t want your daughter.\n\n2) She's not obligated to include YOUR stepson in her life when she doesn't even have a relationship with you.", "*I have a 15 yo bio daughter who lives full time with her dad.*\n\n*I feel like she is doing all of this on purpose and trying to hurt my stepson*\n\nI can't begin to wonder why she might be acting out s/", "YTA she isn\u2019t trying to hurt your step son she\u2019s trying to hurt you.", "YTA. Why would she want him to be involved in her life, parties and events? It's ok if you don't feel motherly love for her or whatever, I'm not judging you for that, but it sucks that you're not able to put yourself in her shoes. You're SO sure this is out of pettiness, but maybe it's just freaking uncomfortable to have the person your biological mother chose to raise instead of you in your circle. This is no bullying, but still, I can see why would your stepson feel this way. It is for the best interest of everyone involved that your son either changes classrooms or schools, since you and stepson so bothered about it.", "Talk to the school. Or switch your son\u2019s school. \n\nThe non-drama solution is to send him to a better school and never look back.", "There is not way to force this. At 15 the school will not get involved like in grade school.\n\nYou have no relationship with your daughter so\nI\u2019m sure she is taking it out on him. If this cannot be resolved between you and her/ the dad then hopefully your SS makes other friends or extreme change school.", "YTA.  You really aren't in any position to say anything about your biological daughter's behavior.  Bring it up with the school as if she were any other random classmate.", "YTA\n\nYou have made it perfectly clear you didn't want her, and lets face it, a 15-year-old with that type of info fuel is going to use it. I can guarantee your son is talking shit about her at school too to all his friends and anyone that will listen. I can probably also peg where he got that info too...Also, it's the little things that really grind a person to the bone, not the big ones. She's not pissed you got remarried like you keep saying you did, she's hurt and angry at the fact you got remarried to a man with a child the same age as her and play mother to him and you never did for her. Do you not see how awful that looks to her, how hurtful and painful that is? Here you are, sticking up for him and defending him, while she sits on the other side never once having been defended and stuck up for by her own mother. Where were you when she was being bullied? Why weren't you asking people to stop bullying her? Oh that's right, you were too busy playing mother to a child that wasn't her; that's how she's going to view this.\n\nLook, I get it, you never wanted her, you claim your ex tampered with the birth control and if that's true; that still gives you absolutely no right to treat her like she's a parasite. My parents never wanted me, I was a complete accident. my mother was on birth control and condoms were used, and I won't get into the graphic details here for modesty purposes as to HOW it happened, I beat the very small odds of it happening, but here I am. The difference, my parents NEVER once told me that I wasn't wanted or treated me like I had ruined their lives in some way. They knew from the start it wasn't my fault. Sure, when I was older I asked questions, and they were honest with me about it. but if I hadn't of been curious and asked about it, I would never have known. This is how it should have been with your daughter. You should never have treated her like this and you should have made every effort to hide how you truly felt about it while not being with your ex. \n\nThough, I can't help but feel there is more going on here. I don't buy this. The way you talk about it all makes me believe that you are lying. I can't shake the feeling that your ex may be just a little more innocent than you are making him seem to be. regardless, you are the asshole for this, both for the way you treat this girl and for thinking somehow this is still her fault. Your step-son didn't get ice cream from the girl he's absolutely tormenting? Too bad, tell him to go buy his own ice cream. Your step-son didn't get invited to the party of the girl he's more than likely spread rumors about? Too bad, so sad, maybe he'll think twice about doing those things. \n\nI know  I can't and won't ever truly know if that's what's going on, but considering your attitude towards this girl, I wouldn't be surprised if he's copying you in how you treat her: mom treats her like shit, so I will too. Also, can I just say to stop calling this girl your daughter when it's convenient for you? She's not your kid. You didn't want her, you gave up rights to her, you treat her like a bitter enemy, so you get no right to call her your daughter at all in the slightest. You are a stranger to her and you made it abundantly clear that you wanted nothing to do with her. You know the saying \"All it takes is a boy to make a child, but a man to be a father\"? Well in this case all it took was a girl to birth a child, it takes a woman to be a mother. That's all you are to this girl, the birth giver, someone who popped her out and nothing else. You have no right to call her your daughter, and you better start getting use to just calling her by name like you would with a co-worker, because that's all you're entitled to.", "YTA. If she doesn\u2019t see him as her friend or family she doesn\u2019t need to invite him. You only invite people you want.", "Everyone here sucks. I'm sorry for what has happened to you, but the way you are going about it with your daughter is awful. I think you should sit down with your daughter and explain to her that the way you feel and act towards your daughter has nothing to do with her but has everything to do with her father. I would also consider therapy for what has happened to you and how to get past it. Therapy for your daughter to help her get her feelings out and understand it's not her fault for how you treat her.", "ESH but you suck more \nif you didn\u2019t want her in the first place she has resentment towards you AND your son since your son essentially replaced her no matter what you think\nshe knows you didn\u2019t want her but for some reason you wanted him. it doesn\u2019t matter to her what her dad did. i know it matters to you but from her POV you abandoned her and raised another child, so it\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t want KIDS it\u2019s that you didn\u2019t want HER \nESH/YTA \n\nit\u2019s not right for her to bully another person but i can understand her resentment.", "Simply not inviting him isn't bullying him.   \n\n\nHow big is this school?

Looking through OPs comments she\u2019s from a country where she doesn\u2019t have full rights as in it wasn\u2019t a crime that he messed with her birth control to force her pregnant. She was also forced to endure a 9 month pregnancy. She\u2019s being called a dead beat for being traumatized from all the SA. A lot of other women would have put the child up for adoption but AGAIN OP is not from the United States so we don\u2019t know if she needed the fathers consent to get rid of the child in this fucked up country she\u2019s from. She\u2019s not being a deadbeat from not wanting to raise her trauma. Again OP specifically said she was forced to go through pregnancy we don\u2019t even know if abortion is allowed in that country. I feel for the kid I really do but the blame shouldn\u2019t be on OP it should be on the dad. Do any of you who are siding against her even know what that abuse she endured does mentally? SA victims give up their kids all the time in the states and get sympathy while doing it meanwhile this woman didn\u2019t even have that option. \nOP your not the AH. I hope your doing better and in therapy. Now as for the daughter I get she\u2019s hurting and lashing out at the stepson by purposely singling him out and she needs therapy as well it\u2019s a sad situation all around and absolutely no one is a winner here with any outcome.", "YTA - I read your comments, you have no relationship with your daughter right now. It\u2019s too bad your step-son has to suffer as a result of *your* behaviour but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s obligation to parent on your behave since you will not or cannot do it yourself.", "I feel like everyone is missing the big picture here because theyre too busy hating on OP.\nIf daughter is bullying the stepson out of some bitterness towards the mother, then what she needs isn't just to not bully stepson, but therapy. But because I feel there's too much info bias from OP, I'm withholding judgement all together.\nAlso, I don't think it's wrong for OP to have abandoned daughter if she was conceived through a tampered condom, that's basically rape. I also don't think its wrong for OP to be raising a step son, because people are allowed to change their minds about kids. That doesn't mean OP hasn't handled this situation very badly, especially if she made it known to daughter that she was so unwanted.", "15 yr olds are in high school.

You should also talk this through with your husband, if you haven\u2019t already - he\u2019s your partner, his support will make navigating this easier. Also, as it sounds like you have an amicable relationship with your stepson, and he\u2019s fifteen, it might be good to have a conversation with him about what he wants to do prior to speaking to the school - he might have other ideas about the situation. \n\nBut given what you\u2019ve said about your daughter\u2019s father and how she was conceived, I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend that you speak to him directly. This is someone who tried to baby trap you - where I live, what he did is considered marital rape. He sounds like a manipulative, violent and dangerous person. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t trust him to not be manipulative towards you or to have an appropriate conversation with your daughter about the bullying. \n\nWhile her actions are harmful and unacceptable, try to remember that your daughter is also a victim of her father\u2019s behaviour. She might feel angry, jealous, unloved and/or abandoned and although that doesn\u2019t mean she is innocent of bullying, she also didn\u2019t deserve to be born as the result of rape. The circumstances you have described would be difficult for anyone to navigate emotionally and socially, especially a fifteen-year-old. If she\u2019s aware of how she was conceived (and she might\u2019ve figured it out on her own even if no one told her), I can\u2019t really bear to think how hard that must be for her.

And while that would/could be considered assault here in the US, it's not where OP is and things like abortion and forfeiture of parental rights (as a female) aren't available where OP is either. \n\nI'm not saying that anyone is right or justified.

School systems could be different. \n\nI remember being in meetings where the entire staff beg the principal not to put students together, and the principal agrees, and is still undermined because jiggling all those kids is apparently pretty overwhelming. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen a multitude of parents demand that their kid\u2019s class is changed due to alleged bullying. It almost never happened in my experience.", "honestly  I feel like the adults should talk with the kids. The daughter is probably jealous and the son hasn't done anything wrong. Shes only 15 this doesn't sound like its the first time. No one told her its wrong, She is the age to know what's wrong and what's wright, but someone has to lead her", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumption about the nature of their relationship when you don\u2019t know the possible nuance in the circumstances.

These things aren\u2019t cut and dry like you think they are.", "I don\u2019t see where it\u2019s stated she\u2019s taken out anything on her daughter. She hasn\u2019t raised her and as a product of rape op has no obligation to do so.\n\nOr where it\u2019s mentioned her son is a bully.", "It literally says everyone in the class is invited to her parties except him, and she brought in ice cream for everyone except him.", "Wow, it's almost as if people don't want to discuss their severe, personal trauma with strangers on the internet.\n\nWe should just start doubting all reports of sexual assault since obviously if you don't want to talk about it, it didn't happen!!! /s", "I very much doubt she is. I'm not going to say with certainty but if it happened the way she said, I would assume she would sign her rights away rather than keep herself and the child in limbo. I think she cheated. I think she cheated with the man she's married to now and I think her ex saw no reason to hide that from their daughter. I very much doubt someone who doesn't want kids to that length is willing to marry a man with kids no qualms. So yeah I don't believe a word she says except that her step son probably is innocent in this.", "I'm not judging the circumstances. I'm judging the clear disdain for, yes a kid who didn't ask for this. Judging the very obvious \"she is the devil and he's a golden angel baby\". Circumstances don't matter here. That she acts like an actual adult in a complex situation regarding kids does. And she isnt.", "Oh yeah after reading her comments she is most definitely the AH. Sad that the boy is stuck in the middle because she absolutely made that bed.", "1st off she wasn't raped. She claims the condom was tampered with. 2 totally different things and 1 of the many reason real rapes aren't taken seriously. 2. She has to now stfu and deal with the fact that the child she didn't want does not want shit to do with the 1 she does want and she can't do shit about it. If she gave a fuck about him being included she would have made it her business to include her daughter in their lives.", "You know that she literally just described rape? Are we suddenly OK with shitting all over rape victims?", "Op was raped\n\nSabotaging condoms is a form of rape\n\nOp needs therapy, it's not the daughters fault but you shouldn't pretend like it's the same", "Well stuff happens, the mom should have to suffer?", "Would you make your stepson include her in things? Be honest. I doubt you would", "So you\u2019re an absent mother who doesn\u2019t take any sort of responsibility of emotional neglect towards your daughter. Get some therapy cause it\u2019s awful how you play mom to your step son but was completely absent from you daughters life. Of course she isn\u2019t going to like your step son cause it hurts her to see her mother be a good parent to him but not your own flesh and blood.", "Then you had plenty of time to ensure your kids weren\u2019t going to the same school. The solution here is easy. Move him to another school.", "Based on this timeline, I\u2019m guessing NTA.\n\nLeaving before before she was born and leaving her dad to raise her was honestly fine in your situation, since she was effectively the result of a sexual assault it is tragic that you had to give birth to her to begin with.\n\nHer dad could have raised her in any reality he wanted, and it sounds like instead of minimizing damage, he likely exacerbated it and trained her to resent you as much as he clearly does. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t think she\u2019s really at fault and I wouldn\u2019t try to force anything with her and her dad. By staying in the same community, you\u2019re exposing yourself to certain uncomfortable realities, and the resentment from your ex and his daughter are one of them. It sucks that your step son has to deal with it, but I would focus on trying to help him rather than punish her \u2014 can he not invite his friends to his own social gatherings? It\u2019s probably better to work around making sure he has plenty of good in his life so that her bullying isn\u2019t as effective.", "Okay, but maybe she doesn't want to invite your stepson to her parties and such because seeing him reminds her of the fact her mother effectively abandoned her? Sure, you pay child support, but kids don't care about that. They care about their parents being there.\n\nI know what her dad did was horrific, and I'm not saying to force a relationship with her, but you can't expect her to be kind and inclusive towards someone who may bring up bad feelings in her when you don't do the same for her.", "Okay, so maybe your daughter doesn't want to be around your stepson because he is a constant reminder of a mother that never wanted her?\n\nYou don't want anything to do with her. So she can also chose not to want to do anything with your stepson, and that includes any event she organises or gift she hands out.", "Perhaps every time she sees your stepson it reminds her of what her Mother is doing to her.  She\u2019s treating your stepson the way you treat her.  Why is it okay when you do it, but it\u2019s wrong when she does it?", "And when she see your stepson she is reminded of a mother who abandoned her. So don\u2019t blame her for something you do yourself!", "You literally said you didn\u2019t want her. You\u2019re just as responsible for BC as what the dad is. You could have terminated as well or fully given up a parental rights.\n\nYou\u2019re blaming your kid for someone else\u2019s actions and you\u2019re all upset because your stepson isn\u2019t friends with her? Oh boo hoo.", "That wasn't her fault! Why should she be punished for it? You can't just cop out and stop being a parent to her. And you certainly cannot demand she take it well when you abandon her to raise someone else.", "And every time your daughter sees your stepson, she is reminded of the fact that she has no mom. She is reminded of the fact that you did not want to be HER mom, because of actions out of her control, before she was even born, while giving all the love she needed from you, to a boy she has to see every day. A boy who reminds her every day, that her mom doesn't love her.", "Fair, and that still isn't her fault. That is something to be taken up with the authorities and to get support with a therapist. Not to tell your daughter that you never wanted her. Imagine if your parents said that to you? Even if you were the result of an assault, you are an entire individual who is not to blame. You not having a relationship with her has been made into her fault, when it was her father's. That needs to be processed and separated. That's not your daughter's burden to bear. That's yours to protect your daughter /from/.", "You could have had an abortion, but you decided to give birth to her and then abandon her. Where is your responsibility in all of this. \n\nGrow the F**k up and stop playing the victim. Your daughter is your victim. You care more about someone else\u2019s child than your own", "I\u2019m sorry I cld never look at my son and just think of what his father did. I didn\u2019t consent to my last pregnancy. It was forced on me after I lost a baby. I never had time to grieve. But when I look at my son I don\u2019t see any of that pain. I see my son who I love to death. Screw his father but my son is my son n I love him n his siblings with everything that I am. As a mother that is what u do. Ur child does NOT pay for the sins of the father", "You're being snarky about information that you didn't provide. Plenty of countries have something similar like giving up parental rights.", "I am not an American.\n\nIf not stated in the story, then how is the reader supposed to know the situation clearly?

There are VERY few countries where Halloween is celebrated at all\nLet alone as a big holiday. Your English suggests North American standard English.\n\nCanada the states and Mexico all allow for parental right termination, as do many\nCountries in South America, and all of the commonwealth countries.\n\nSo like say where you are from or stop mentioning \u201cnot everyone is American\u201d because people can only comment based on info given.", "Which Country are you in then?", "They're not incapable.

Excluding just one person all of the time is a very basic kind of bullying, and should be enough to have them placed in different classes.", "If you bring treats in for your friends you wouldn't be expected to give to anyone else. When you treat everyone but one person you're making a point. Deliberate and pointed exclusion is bullying. It seems that this was pretty well explained. Maybe the story was embellished but if this went down as described then it absolutely is bullying.", "No, but I know children who have done that and I remember form when I was in school.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually right to compartment the daughter\u2019s actions as an action of bullying, if the mother\u2019s giving up the daughter is considered an act of prioritizing own self mental health then the daughter\u2019s actions can be categorized the same .\n\nThe stepson represents her own mother\u2019s abandonment and it\u2019s unfair to be asked to deal with this on daily base. It\u2019s better for the two kids to not have to interact with each other.\n\nThe daughter\u2019s trauma is being trivialized by the mother as an act of jealousy, it\u2019s bigger than this . This is a child that was abandoned at birth by her own mother . It\u2019s understandable that the mother considers her daughter\u2019s existence as a traumatic event . It\u2019s better for all parties to stay separate .", "Oh thanks. I guess I didn\u2019t read very carefully.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m amazed the teacher would allow that.

Shame it often hurt the kids.", "Doubtful. HES the wanted one.", "The ex husband raped her. She was never involved in the child\u2019s life.

From comments OP may not be in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, you're NTA for asking, but the way you treat your daughter is ABSOLUTELY the reason she's lashing out. I wouldn't be surprised if stepson started it by telling her how unwanted she was by you or rubbing in that he gets you're love and time and she doesn't. Even if that didn't happen, of COURSE she's retaliating when you've probably made it very clear you don't want her. Instead of taking your trauma out on your innocent child, you should've gotten some mental help to deal with that trauma instead of passing it on to your daughter. YTA for trying to make this seem like petty teen stuff instead of recognizing your daughter is in pain and YOU CAUSED THAT PAIN.", "But she is not you. You are different people.  \n\nAlso, may be it is not nice of her to recent the rape baby, but it is quite common: mothers often struggle to form bonds with children born of sexual assault, the children much more often endure traumatic events leading to PTSD etc. so it't not something very rare.

I guess I don\u2019t believe it because the teacher would have to be blind and incompetent to allow this.", "lol, I\u2019ve heard some pretty misinformed rumours from schoolchildren. I wouldn\u2019t put stock in it.", ">I\u2019m amazed the teacher would allow that. Almost hard to believe.\n\nMy kid's primary school had to bring in rules to prevent the exclusion thing from happening.  Parents were asking teachers to hand out invitations to parties or give things out but kid's not in the clique, or maybe that should be kids whose parents weren't in the clique, weren't getting invites/gifts.  Then kid's and even some parents were being dicks by making it obvious certain people were being excluded.So they had to make a hard rule that things like party invitations or gifts that were being done in bulk can only be done in school if every kid in class is getting one.\n\nHow the fuck parents had the balls to ask a teacher to hand out party invites knowing that one or two kid's were being excluded I don't know!  \n\nIt wasn't just Birthday parties but people were organising things like end of year parties, last day of school parties and that sort of shit too.", "Yeah that gets me too. Like I\u2019ve never known a teacher to be like hey let\u2019s exclude this kid! Seems odd. Any functional teacher would call that out.", "I won't lie, unless someone can prove otherwise the terminology she's using implies that she very well could be in the USA. If she is, signing rights away is possible. I obviously have no clue where OP is however. But if she's in the USA she needs to sign her rights over.", "But she wants the rape baby to come through for her real kid that she chooses to love! The least the daughter can do for the burden of being born is to involve mommy's replacement kid in parties! \n\nOP claims the daughter is such an awful person but the biggest thing that big bad bully daughter has done is (check notes) not include him in her life or any events she throws. Can you believe that?! After being abandoned by her mother she doesn't want her mommy's kid that she actually loves being rubbed in her face. How awful!/s\n\nSeriously, that makes the daughter more justified", "Agreed but by not being involved in the daughter\u2019s life, it\u2019s a source of trauma for her and she shouldn\u2019t have to include (by extension) the source of her trauma to parties or events.", "Yup exactly this! I feel awful for op daughter that she had to put up with this", "A child who is the result of sexual assault is just not the burden of the victim of that assault. It\u2019s a bummer that her dad/the man who committed reproductive coercion against OP chose to raise his child with resentment towards the woman he victimized, but it sounds like OP gave up parental rights before the child was born and has no real responsibility to her.\n\nI hope the daughter comes to terms with this all someday since she\u2019s obviously struggling, but since OP surrendered full custody at birth and clearly relinquished her parental responsibilities here, I would not consider the girls upbringing to be her responsibility.", "You've made it clear that this girl is not your daughter.  You don't treat her as your daughter, nor do you view her as your daughter.  I'm not going to call you an AH for that, but you do need to stop calling her your daughter.  She's your ex's daughter, nothing more (even if you are paying child support), and you need to treat the situation as such.\n\nHowever, I'm guessing this girl is probably hurt by your rejection, while you being a parent to other children.  Which I can also understand.\n\nThe solution is with the school, not your ex.  You need to treat this girl as if she was just another classmate of your stepson, report the bullying, and see what options to school has to seperate them and address the issue.", "Didn\u2019t realize America was the only place you had to deal with the consequences of your own actions.", "Respectfully, why should the daughter have to endure family therapy with a woman she doesn't share a home with, does not have a parental role in her life, and does not need or deserve her forgiveness?\n\nOP is not entitled to reconciliation with the daughter she abandoned. Period.", "OP is an adult who blames her bio daughter who is a minor for what her dad did. Her daughter doesn\u2019t deserve such callous treatment from her own mom.

She definitely does need therapy though.", "I didn't say family therapy. I just said they both need to go to therapy, though eventually moving to family therapy too.\n\nIt's not about reconciliation. It's about them being able to cope with their trauma and potentially moving to a stage where at the least, op can be upfront and tell her daughter why it happened.\n\nIt's not about forgiveness. Why do you think therapy is just about forgiveness?", "I agree that her daughter is a victim of her mother's trauma, just as OP was a victim of her ex's sexual assault. But that's why I said she needed to get some mental help so that she didn't traumatize her daughter.", "She doesn't blame her, but seeing her reminds her of what he did. Which is a trauma response. She needs therapy", "Oh, I\u2019m certainly not suggesting bullying in schools isn\u2019t rampant.
