She has another daughter named Andy (4f) that she and her wife Ella (38f) had together shortly after they got married.\n\nI\u2019m not very close with my mom. My bio dad wasn\u2019t the best person, and I know that in her eyes, I was just a reminder of him. \nWhen I was 8, she sent me off to live with my grandmother, and really the only time I ever heard from her was when she\u2019d send money for me every few months.\n\nI spent a very large portion of my childhood wondering why she didn\u2019t want me, or why she never seemed to even like me. I would always create reasons as to why, convincing myself that I must have done something wrong. Before Andy was born, and my mother and I had sort of started to speak more than we had previously, my therapist suggested that I just sit my mom down and talk to her directly. Instead of wondering what the answers were, I could just hear them from the source.\n\nMy mom told me that she sent me to live with my grandmother because she couldn\u2019t stand being near me. Me being out of her sight made it easier for her to pretend I didn\u2019t exist, which then made it easier for her to go on with her life and heal.\nI don\u2019t blame her for feeling that way, like I said my bio dad isn\u2019t a good person, and I get why she couldn\u2019t handle being my mom. I don\u2019t necessarily forgive her because I was a kid and I deserved better but I also don\u2019t hold her totally responsible because I know she was going through a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much her wife Ella knows about our history, but she has been very clearly trying to get my mom and I to reconnect.\nI guess she wants me to know Andy. Maybe they both do, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nMy mom asked me to meet her for coffee to talk. While we were at the coffee place, she told me that she was sorry about how things played out between us, and that she hoped her apology was enough for me to forgive her. I said that it meant a lot to hear her say sorry, but that her saying it wasn\u2019t enough for me to just forgive and forget it all. I understand her and I empathize with her, but I can\u2019t forgive her.\n\nAfter I left, she ended up texting me and telling me how unfair I was being to tell her that her \u201csorry\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings.\nIn her last text she said that I didn\u2019t have to outright say I can\u2019t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself.\n\nI guess she\u2019s right.

It's a mystery to me how parents can cause actual trauma to their children and then get mad when they're hold accountable for it. It's good that she's trying to reconnect but that doesn't mean you own her anything, that doesn't cancel how much she has hurt you!", "NTA, I don't get these people who seem to think saying \"Sorry\" entitles you to blanket immunity no matter what kind of horrible stuff you did, and abandoning a child is way up there. I don't know what your dad did to your mom, but what she did to you is unforgivable.", "NTA\n\nWhy does your mom think that this is about her?", "NTA, saying sorry doesn't magically fix things. If you break a plate and then tell it you are sorry you broke it, does the plate magically become whole again? No.", "NTA  my father drank a lot for years,  he said he was sorry -  his excuse was he blacked out a lot and didn't remember what he did.  I told he was lucky, I wasn't able to blackout and was forced to suffer with horrible memories, so no, your sorry doesn't cut it. It's good she said it, but that doesn't automatically mean you need to accept it. A true apology takes work, it's not just a quick \"sorry I destroyed you\" and let's move on. My father and I have worked for a few years and no, we'll never have that perfect relationship but it's much better than it was.", "Nta. Her reaction tells you she hasn't changed. She still lacks any real empathy for you. If you care enough make her go to therapy with you and see what happens. If not flick her... But maybe ensure Andy doesn't think it's her fault.", "NTA. I mean, I understand your mother struggled to get to the point of saying she was sorry, however, she isn't thinking of you or your feelings all throughout these years. She doesn't understand how her rejection affected you and how all those years in which you had to fabricate, so to speak, reasons for her not reaching out to you made you suffer. She is thinking only on herself, her feelings, her struggles and what have you, but she is not giving you the slightest thought and all the things you went through during the years in which she pretended you did not exist. Perhaps you should cut contact again until she is able to understand all of this.", "NTA, just because she healed from her hurt doesn't mean you healed from yours. A parent is by default responsible for their children's well being, full stop. You don't owe her anything, you wouldn't owe her anything if she raised you, which she didn't, which was 100% her choice. You never had a choice. You just take all the time you need and never feel like you can't speak your truth. Some people will threaten to withhold something they think you want in order to get their way, kinda sounds like your mother is making demands in order to give you the relationship she thinks you want.", "NTA at all. Your assessment of her actions is profoundly empathetic and kind, considering she abandoned you. Her excuse is insufficient (I have two children by two husbands \\[16 years apart\\], both of whom strongly resemble their abusive dads, and I did not abandon them). From what you said, all you\u2019re asking for is for her to acknowledge the depth of what she did. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s still being selfish. I hope you find all the love and acceptance you deserve.", "NTA but your mom is. This is NOT your fault. None of it. Not her staying away from you before and not y\u2019all\u2019s difficulty reconnecting now. She needs a shit ton of therapy to deal with her past and to stop putting her issues on you. And to be honest she may never get there. Her being sorry doesn\u2019t erase what she did to you. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. Her apology isn't enough. She deeply traumatized you, regardless of the read (I read your explanation). If she was truly sorry, she would give you time to process and see how the relationship might proceed. An apology is supposed to be for the one hurt. Your mother has made it about herself, so the apology was not sincere (she might have been hurt by your father, but that was not your fault).", "NTA. Your mom is, but mostly for her recent actions. \n\nAs someone whose mom also left, I can empathize with how you felt growing up. However, I don't blame her so much for that- it was probably better than her keeping and neglecting/abusing you. \n\nBut to waltz back in now, decades later, demanding your forgiveness and doing NOTHING to earn it, all for the sake of her new happy little family is selfish as fuck. If she wants a relationship with you, it's up to her to put the work in and you have every right to reject her. You owe her nothing. You were actually very kind in your reply and imo she didn't even deserve that kindness.", "Oh boy\n\nNTA\n\n- one can ASK for forgiveness, one is NOT ENTITLED to forgiveness \n\n- saying \"I'm sorry\" is not permission to hurt you again\n\n- apologies are not a quick one and done magic cure all, that automatically erases all past actions.\n\n- you were honest, without being harsh. And you are on your own healing journey. Maybe one day you both will be at the same chapter of this saga. But that does not mean your mother gets to decide IF and When that happens.", "NTA \n\nYour feelings  are valid. Your mother  abandoned you as a child. You felt it. It profoundly hurt you. It shook you to your core. It has, and it will, affect you for life.\n\nI would say that your mom wasn't the asshole when she sent you to live with your grandparents. Obviously, she was unable to care for you. While I could judge her for that, it isn't my place. It's absolutely okay for you to judge her through.\n\nIt is possible that she thought that your grandparents could provide you with the love and care that she was unable to give you. That is something that I don't know.\n\nThat was what I was leaning towards, until you shared her text messages.\n\nAs I said, your feelings are legitimate.  Your feelings are valid. Your mother can offer an apology. You don't have to accept it. You aren't obligated to accept it.\n\nYour mother's texts were insensitive. They were selfish. They didn't acknowledge your pain. They didn't acknowledge your experience. They didn't acknowledge that you feel rejected by her, and neither did her \"apology\". Again, your mother invalidated and dismissed you. She dismissed your experience, she dismissed your pain, she dismissed abandoning you. \n\nHer apology wasn't enough.", "NTA, but she's lying, this has nothing to do with your dad and everything to her being lazy and just couldn't be bothered. I've never looked at my children and thought I don't want to raise these kids because they remind me of their Dad. Hell no these are my kids and he has nothing to do with it.", "*\"In her last text she said that I didn\u2019t have to outright say I can\u2019t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself\"*\n\nShe \"hoped her apology was enough to forgive her\".........it wasn\u2019t and you told her that.......WTF IS THE ISSUE?\n\nDon't ask questions you don't want answers too.\n\nIt's terrible that your bio dad traumatized your mom.\n\nBut **YOU ARE NOT HIM!!!!**\n\nYou got punished because he was your \"dad\".\n\nYour mom should feel extremely lucky that you're even willing to speak to her.\n\n*\"She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings\"*\n\nYeah.....tough shit, how do you think YOUR DAUGHTER felt when her mom abandoned her? Do you think that didn\u2019t \"hurt her feelings\"?.....PATHETIC!!!\n\nInstead of crying about it, She should ask you how YOU want to try and (re)build a relationship.\n\nNTA at all and you wouldn\u2019t be one if you never spoke to her again either.", "NAH.

Could Stepmom Ella be a better mom for OP?\n\nThat said.... Yeah, they're definitely looking for a babysitter.", "I think that's a very easy shoulda woulda coulda thing to say. Yes the trauma was done and that's awful, but it's probably really difficult to reconcile looking at your child who was a product of rape, constantly being retraumatized by their mere existence, while also still trying to in SOME capacity not be the world's shittiest parent.

You're not always going to make the lost salient and beneficial decisions.", "NTA. \n\nshe didn't think twice about freely telling her child she couldn't stand to be around them and preferred to pretend they didn't exist... but when that same child respects themselves enough to know \"good enough\" isn't good enough, that's the hill she dies on?\nyou've been through a lot and I don't know if I'd be nearly as emotional mature knowing what you do about your conception. take this at your own speed and please *never* worry about how your words might affect this relationship. it really sounds like you're going about this with grace.", "NTA\n\nI didn't hear your mom really say anything other than her own feelings. Did she even acknowledge how messed up it was to put all that on a child? It happened to you, too and you said what you felt and it was fair. She isn't entitled to an absolvement just like you aren't obligated to forgive.", "NTA - you didn't have to be upfront about it sure...but then again...she didn't have to leave you behind only to give a crap once she got remarried and she wanted to give her wife a happy Instagram family \ud83d\udc4c\n\nClearly her apology was not sincere because if it were she would not be attempting to manipulate you by gaslighting you into believing that you HAVE to at least PRETEND to forgive her...she literally did not care if she actually HAD your forgiveness...what she wanted to do was tell her wife that you had forgiven her \ud83d\udc4c\n\nThe audacity of her to put her trauma on you like that and then pile trauma of your own on top of it! What a sh*t sundae your parents made for you \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc94\n\nIt literally sickens me that people bring other people into the world and then just abandon them! My own bio-mom abandoned my older brother and I when I was an infant...thankfully we were adopted by wonderful people but even at 30 I am still bitter towards my bio-mom...she had me from an affair so her husband left and she also couldn't stand to look at me...why? Because we remind them that they made a mistake...but how is that on us? We didn't CHOOSE to be brought into this world! Other people's choices brought us here!\n\nShe brought you into this world...she owed you a parent...and she didn't deliver \ud83d\udc4c\n\n1000x NTA", "NTA - Apparently, she doesn\u2019t want any \u201creminders\u201d about her abandonment of you either.  Your mother is still demonstrating that only her feelings and wants matter. She claims to want forgiveness\u2026.but only if it\u2019s on her terms. In fact, even if you don\u2019t forgive her, you mother doesn\u2019t want to you to share this information with her (i.e., she doesn\u2019t want to know how you feel). This is not how it works when you\u2019ve wronged someone and want forgiveness. Especially when what was done to you by your mother is so significant. Your mother is a piece of work. Please be careful. She\u2019s not ready for a reconciliation and I think you could get hurt.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s mom\u2019s actions and the passage of time that will allow you to forgive your mom (***IF*** you even want to), not some pretty words. Honestly it was kind of manipulative of her to basically ask for forgiveness without *technically* asking, and then being butthurt when you told the truth. I imagine she was probably being truthful when she said it took her a lot of work to own up to her mistakes, and that\u2019s good for her to acknowledge. But just because she has put that work in doesn\u2019t mean you are obligated to forgive her. The work is still worthwhile though.", "NTA and you handled yourself with grace and empathy. If she's expecting you to immediately forgive her then she's apologizing for the wrong reasons. She should say sorry because she genuinely recognized the hurt she caused you, not so she can feel better herself. Forgiveness is something you do for yourself to be at peace, not for the person who wronged you. It's on your time and you're NTA for standing your ground and letting your mom know where you're at in terms of your healing. You're doing great.", "I was in a similar situation, I was the catalyst and was put in foster care. My bio mom couldn't stand me because every time she looked at me it brought everything back", "\"Your lifelong trauma isn't fixed with one phrase on my part? How unfair!\"\n\nObviously NTA.", ">She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings.\n\nExcept that's not what you said. You said you appreciated the apology but it isn't enough. It's not going to magically erase all the hurt she caused you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHow sorry can she really be if her reaction to you not feeling okay forgiving her got turned into a spiel about herself?  She says it was hard for her to apologize?  BS.  She said she was sorry for how \"things played out\" as if it were a person she was in a relationship with that she broke up with you rather than her being a mother who cruelly abandoned her child and never made an effort to reconnect until her new partner pushed for it and she wants brownie points with them.\n\nHer main priority, judging from her reaction, is still herself.  If she had truly wanted to atone she wouldn't expect a basic apology to erase everything.  An apology is just sticking a bandaid on a shattered window if it doesn't come with any other effort to fix the damage.  She would know it would require time and effort to show that she cared about you if she really was sorry.  Her demands and upset are entirely centered around her own convenience.\n\nYou weren't wrong to say it.  You were being honest.  She was the one in the wrong for demanding you not express feelings that she doesn't want to hear.  She's not the victim.  She doesn't get to set the terms.", "Nta-i'm not sure how to put into words-she failed you and apologies don't mend everything one does. it is up to you what fixes the issues and how much effort she needs to pu in to be part of your life. It is your choice to except her not the other way round.", "NTA (close to N A H). It's worth noting OP has said she is a product of her mother being raped by her friend when she came out to him.\n\nI still say NTA because apologies don't guarantee forgiveness or relationships (though it may have been accurate to say you do forgive it but you aren't ready to be close - I'm not entirely sure from my reading). Ultimately, she wasn't wrong to give you up, and you weren't wrong to be really affected by it. She is wrong to expect you to deal with her feelings like this.\n\nI'm sorry you had to grow up with that hurt, no one deserves that.", "You do not owe her anything. She abandoned you and feels guilty\u2026.or others have convinced her she should feel guilty. Narcissists like her really don\u2019t feel guilt like most people. I suggest counseling for you and keeping her at arms length.", "She probably wants to reconnect so you would babysit your younger sister. I mean it took *14 years* for her to get over your biodad? And she  *blamed*  a child!?!\n\nI wouldn't accept her apology either. Better to just go low or no contact with her. BTW, does your biodad know she's a lesbian? Could've been part of the problem with their marriage.", "She is is still an asshole. I speak from experience. I would never do that to my child what she did to Op.", "Her mother knew that the child would be a concrete reminder and she chose to give birth to her and keep the child anyway. She could have chosen to terminate the pregnancy or give the child up for adoption, but she didn't. I do have sympathy for her situation, but I also think that if she chose to have and keep the child knowing the circumstances, she had to take responsibility for the child, too (unless she was somehow forced to carry the pregnancy to term and not give the child up for adoption).", "This situation reminds me of the \u2018missing missing reasons\u2019. Parents who frame narratives so that it\u2019s all about them - the reasons why their kids are hurting somehow doesn\u2019t exist.

Good for you to know your feelings and speaking them. Wishing you all the best", "NTA. She is selfish and astonishingly self-centered and oblivious to your feelings. She is ignoring the power dynamic between mother and child and acting like you are an equal who had equal responsibility for the failed relationship when in fact 100% of the fault and responsibility is hers and hers alone.", "NTA. Clearly your mum only wanted to apologise to clear her own conscious rather than make any amends.", "Oh mom can f off. Abandoning your child and not even being able to hear the child does not forgive. Your mom should have raised you full stop. Doesn't matter if you remind her of her ex. She sounds immature and if I were you i would be careful in what I would emotionally invest in her. Hugs and love how brave and emphatic you are.", "said this in another thread and will say it here, forgiveness first and foremost has be for you, not for the party forgiven. \n\nyou are not obliged to forgive anything just because someone said sorry, and if she was truly sorry than accepting this would be on your mother. \n\nBeing sorry means trying to make amends, blaming you for \"not forgiving\" isn't making amends, it's complaining that you didn't reward her for paying lip service.", "NTA\n\nForgive me for connecting this to my own life, but what you experienced reminds me of my (non-existent) relationship with my bio-dad.\n\nHe abandoned me as a child (and would later justify it as feeling he wasn\u2019t good enough for my family and was sure I was in good hands), then popped up via Facebook when I was in my mid-twenties. It was shocking, disruptive, almost scary. I had nightmares as a child about this man with a familiar face that I didn\u2019t know.\n\nAfter exchanging some messages via Facebook over some years long after he first reached out with a rambling message, we met in person for the first time (with his current wife and my partner in attendance) summer 2021. We had a stilted lunch where my partner was charming, his wife was nice but covering for his weirdness, and he seemed pretty disinterested in my life. I went into that meal feeling like he was a big boogeyman I\u2019d had my whole life, and left feeling like he was just a small man.\n\nWe texted and messaged maybe another month. I wanted to make a relationship with this guy (because deep down, I thought I wanted one), but for me that required some honesty about what he did by abandoning me, without excuses and fake blame cast on my maternal family. He wanted absolution. It was clear he wanted to be forgiven\u2026 I guess for peace in the little niggling part of his mind that may have felt bad about this one kid he let go? His wife (who reached out on Facebook before him, with whom I had no relationship)? His other two kids, whom he sort of sees, but who knew about me before I knew about them? Idk. But he wanted to be forgiven and for me not to question the shitty non-contribution he made to my life. \n\nI blocked him.\n\nHow selfish of your mom, to cast you aside, and then to blame you for her apology not being good enough. I\u2019m sorry.", "Well, diddums! How dare she prioritise her hurty feelz over how she treated you! So angry on your behalf! NTA", "NTA? Unfair? You showed a lot of maturity in your answer. I hate these people who show how much of a vindictive person I am, LOL! In your place, I would at least sl____ the shit out of her...\n\nEdit: The consensual sex thing, rape, should never be of the main post by. She still NTA, but in a way lower level.", "NTA. And, you never have to forgive her. Your father might have been truly awful, but you aren't your father, and blaming you for his faults is cruel.", "NTA, apologies and forgiveness should always be for the person wronged, it isn't about the person who has screwed up. Your mum was clearly apologising for herself because if she was doing it for you and to rebuild a relationship then she would be allowing you to lead and heal, not making herself a victim.", "An apology isn\u2019t sincere if you feel entitled to it being accepted. That is just window dressing. NTA OP. You deserve so much better than she has given you.", "NTA. You didn't say it was nothing, you said it wasn't enough. The sufficiency of an apology is determined by the receiver, not the giver.", "This is the right answer.\n\nI feel like the clearest part where the mom was an AH is that she felt entitled to forgiveness. Her actions, given the context, are actually extremely sympathetic and yet OP still ended up feeling hurt and abandoned. We don't necessarily have to assign 'fault' per say, there are just situations where someone being hurt is unavoidable, but forgiveness or acceptance or whatever you want to call it is a process, and she needs to get that if she wants to make this work.", "You did nothing wrong. And you should be very cautious about this \"reconnecting.\" She clearly does not have the self-awareness to have a healthy relationship with you. She may hurt you all over again.", "OPs father raped her mother. That's how she was conceived. \n\nThis is not just a relationship gone wrong that's literal trauma ontop of trauma.", "Not really, though. Instead of allowing her to be adopted into a family that would love her and have genuine care for her, she emotionally neglected her and then sent her off at some point in her early childhood to grandma. She left her wondering what she did wrong and why she was unloved. It would have been kinder to allow her to be adopted."]}
