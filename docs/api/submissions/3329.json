She has another daughter named Andy (4f) that she and her wife Ella (38f) had together shortly after they got married.\n\nI\u2019m not very close with my mom. My bio dad wasn\u2019t the best person, and I know that in her eyes, I was just a reminder of him. \nWhen I was 8, she sent me off to live with my grandmother, and really the only time I ever heard from her was when she\u2019d send money for me every few months.\n\nI spent a very large portion of my childhood wondering why she didn\u2019t want me, or why she never seemed to even like me. I would always create reasons as to why, convincing myself that I must have done something wrong. Before Andy was born, and my mother and I had sort of started to speak more than we had previously, my therapist suggested that I just sit my mom down and talk to her directly. Instead of wondering what the answers were, I could just hear them from the source.\n\nMy mom told me that she sent me to live with my grandmother because she couldn\u2019t stand being near me. Me being out of her sight made it easier for her to pretend I didn\u2019t exist, which then made it easier for her to go on with her life and heal.\nI don\u2019t blame her for feeling that way, like I said my bio dad isn\u2019t a good person, and I get why she couldn\u2019t handle being my mom. I don\u2019t necessarily forgive her because I was a kid and I deserved better but I also don\u2019t hold her totally responsible because I know she was going through a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much her wife Ella knows about our history, but she has been very clearly trying to get my mom and I to reconnect.\nI guess she wants me to know Andy. Maybe they both do, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nMy mom asked me to meet her for coffee to talk. While we were at the coffee place, she told me that she was sorry about how things played out between us, and that she hoped her apology was enough for me to forgive her. I said that it meant a lot to hear her say sorry, but that her saying it wasn\u2019t enough for me to just forgive and forget it all. I understand her and I empathize with her, but I can\u2019t forgive her.\n\nAfter I left, she ended up texting me and telling me how unfair I was being to tell her that her \u201csorry\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings.\nIn her last text she said that I didn\u2019t have to outright say I can\u2019t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself.\n\nI guess she\u2019s right. I definitely didn\u2019t have to say it, but I did.\n\nEdit:\n\nPlease read my comments for further context (sorry I didn\u2019t include it here) but my mother isn\u2019t a narcissist and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad person. I think we\u2019re both unfortunately products of our situations and I\u2019m not mad at her. Not really. I don\u2019t like that it happened, and I wish that I could change it, but I obviously can\u2019t. I recognize that she was hurt but I also recognize that I was a child, and while her hurt explains why my childhood was the way it was, I know it doesn\u2019t entirely excuse it.", "created_utc": 1669516312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5p66c/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_her_apology_isnt/", "score": 1106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a mystery to me how parents can cause actual trauma to their children and then get mad when they're hold accountable for it. It's good that she's trying to reconnect but that doesn't mean you own her anything, that doesn't cancel how much she has hurt you!", "NTA, I don't get these people who seem to think saying \"Sorry\" entitles you to blanket immunity no matter what kind of horrible stuff you did, and abandoning a child is way up there. I don't know what your dad did to your mom, but what she did to you is unforgivable.", "NTA\n\nWhy does your mom think that this is about her?", "NTA, saying sorry doesn't magically fix things. If you break a plate and then tell it you are sorry you broke it, does the plate magically become whole again? No.", "NTA  my father drank a lot for years,  he said he was sorry -  his excuse was he blacked out a lot and didn't remember what he did.  I told he was lucky, I wasn't able to blackout and was forced to suffer with horrible memories, so no, your sorry doesn't cut it. It's good she said it, but that doesn't automatically mean you need to accept it. A true apology takes work, it's not just a quick \"sorry I destroyed you\" and let's move on. My father and I have worked for a few years and no, we'll never have that perfect relationship but it's much better than it was.", "Nta. Her reaction tells you she hasn't changed. She still lacks any real empathy for you. If you care enough make her go to therapy with you and see what happens. If not flick her... But maybe ensure Andy doesn't think it's her fault.", "NTA. I mean, I understand your mother struggled to get to the point of saying she was sorry, however, she isn't thinking of you or your feelings all throughout these years. She doesn't understand how her rejection affected you and how all those years in which you had to fabricate, so to speak, reasons for her not reaching out to you made you suffer. She is thinking only on herself, her feelings, her struggles and what have you, but she is not giving you the slightest thought and all the things you went through during the years in which she pretended you did not exist. Perhaps you should cut contact again until she is able to understand all of this.", "NTA, just because she healed from her hurt doesn't mean you healed from yours. A parent is by default responsible for their children's well being, full stop. You don't owe her anything, you wouldn't owe her anything if she raised you, which she didn't, which was 100% her choice. You never had a choice. You just take all the time you need and never feel like you can't speak your truth. Some people will threaten to withhold something they think you want in order to get their way, kinda sounds like your mother is making demands in order to give you the relationship she thinks you want.", "NTA at all. Your assessment of her actions is profoundly empathetic and kind, considering she abandoned you. Her excuse is insufficient (I have two children by two husbands \\[16 years apart\\], both of whom strongly resemble their abusive dads, and I did not abandon them). From what you said, all you\u2019re asking for is for her to acknowledge the depth of what she did. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s still being selfish. I hope you find all the love and acceptance you deserve.", "NTA but your mom is. This is NOT your fault. None of it. Not her staying away from you before and not y\u2019all\u2019s difficulty reconnecting now. She needs a shit ton of therapy to deal with her past and to stop putting her issues on you. And to be honest she may never get there. Her being sorry doesn\u2019t erase what she did to you. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. Her apology isn't enough. She deeply traumatized you, regardless of the read (I read your explanation). If she was truly sorry, she would give you time to process and see how the relationship might proceed. An apology is supposed to be for the one hurt. Your mother has made it about herself, so the apology was not sincere (she might have been hurt by your father, but that was not your fault).", "NTA. Your mom is, but mostly for her recent actions. \n\nAs someone whose mom also left, I can empathize with how you felt growing up. However, I don't blame her so much for that- it was probably better than her keeping and neglecting/abusing you. \n\nBut to waltz back in now, decades later, demanding your forgiveness and doing NOTHING to earn it, all for the sake of her new happy little family is selfish as fuck. If she wants a relationship with you, it's up to her to put the work in and you have every right to reject her. You owe her nothing. You were actually very kind in your reply and imo she didn't even deserve that kindness.", "Oh boy\n\nNTA\n\n- one can ASK for forgiveness, one is NOT ENTITLED to forgiveness \n\n- saying \"I'm sorry\" is not permission to hurt you again\n\n- apologies are not a quick one and done magic cure all, that automatically erases all past actions.\n\n- you were honest, without being harsh. And you are on your own healing journey. Maybe one day you both will be at the same chapter of this saga. But that does not mean your mother gets to decide IF and When that happens.", "NTA \n\nYour feelings  are valid. Your mother  abandoned you as a child. You felt it. It profoundly hurt you. It shook you to your core. It has, and it will, affect you for life.\n\nI would say that your mom wasn't the asshole when she sent you to live with your grandparents. Obviously, she was unable to care for you. While I could judge her for that, it isn't my place. It's absolutely okay for you to judge her through.\n\nIt is possible that she thought that your grandparents could provide you with the love and care that she was unable to give you. That is something that I don't know.\n\nThat was what I was leaning towards, until you shared her text messages.\n\nAs I said, your feelings are legitimate.  Your feelings are valid. Your mother can offer an apology. You don't have to accept it. You aren't obligated to accept it.\n\nYour mother's texts were insensitive. They were selfish. They didn't acknowledge your pain. They didn't acknowledge your experience. They didn't acknowledge that you feel rejected by her, and neither did her \"apology\". Again, your mother invalidated and dismissed you. She dismissed your experience, she dismissed your pain, she dismissed abandoning you. \n\nHer apology wasn't enough.", "NTA, but she's lying, this has nothing to do with your dad and everything to her being lazy and just couldn't be bothered.

She doesn't get to say \"You can't tell me my apology is meaningless\". I understand the difficulties in owning up to what she did,but she can't say \"Well,since I struggled,you need to accept my apology\". That's not how apologies work.

Years later, when confronted  she told you it was because she couldn\u2019t stand the sight of you. And this after years of blaming yourself. Now her new wife is pushing some kind of reconciliation. Your mothers response was a \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. \nNope. \nNot today Satan. Today is NOT that day.\n1. You are an inspiration. The grace and strength you have shown is quite frankly astounding.\n2. You\u2019ve obviously done a ton of therapy and self reflection.\n3.

They don't get to hastily repair the messy reality at your expense though.\n\nYou can let her know that you appreciate the apology and that it's not nothing. It's a start. It took her time to process everything that happened to her, it will also take you time to process it.\n\nI see how she could really worked up about the apology. If she thought this was finally going to be the moment where she could REALLY put everything behind her. But YOU need time and process for your own feelings.

It is fair to ask that she show you some empathy as well. It's generational trauma.", "Nta.\n\nHeres the rub: people dont have to accept apologies.\n\nSorry is nowhere near enough for the trauma she put you through, whether you blame her for it entirely or not. In fact, there may never be anything that can make you forgive her.\n\nIf you smash a plate on the floor and tell it youre sorry it doesn't magically come back together. It takes a lot of dedicated, detailed, extensive work to put it back together and it will never, ever be the same.\n\nSorry is the beginning. She is still on the hook for the rest and the fact that she answers your well thought out explanation as unfair and gets pissy is not a great sign. People who are genuinely contrite and accept their faults and misdeeds dont generally get pissy about rejected apologies.", "NTA. Apologizing doesn't magically make all the pain you've gone through go away. You were honest with her which is what you needed to do and she needed to hear. It's not what she wanted to hear because she has to live with taking her pain out on an innocent child whom she neglected. \n\nYour pain is valid and she needs to know the truth if any sort of healing on both sides can truly begin. If you had lied about accepting her apology your relationship could never progress forward. \n\nThere's going to be a few steps back and some hurt feelings and painful reality before you can move forward again. \n\nYou have to remind her that this isn't about her.

Remorse for her actions and show empathy for the hurt she caused.\n3. Restitution, she needs to make things right by demonstrating her unconditional love and support. \n\nYour mother did none of these things so it wasn't a real apology.

Her child was still harmed by her actions considering she waited until they were eight years old and then vanished.  That would cause a lot of emotional damage for any kid.  Though I can understand, the OP is allowed to still feel hurt and abandoned and have complicated feelings.  They are still a human being.  When I say the mom wasn't the victim, I mean in this instance.  If you hurt someone, you don't get to decide how the person harmed feels about it when you apologize.  She doesn't get to dictate to OP about how they need to feel about her and then make them feel bad when they don't get the exact answer they wanted.", "&#x200B;\n\nedit because formatting is hard.\n\nAgree 100%. OP is NTA.  If your bio-mother comes at you again to berate you for not being willing to forgive her after a rehearsed, generic, non-apology, point that she has not even stated the things she needs to have forgiven. She chose to keep you and then treated you like the criminal, and made you feel like it was something you did wrong- which kids always think.\n\nIf she still doesn\u2019t get it, ask her what her response would be it the real criminal who violated your bio-mother came to her and said he was \u201c was sorry about how things played out between us, and he hope his apology was enough for her to forgive him.\u201d Then ask if his excuses as to why it wasn\u2019t his fault because of how seeing her upset him would fly (they wouldn\u2019t.)\n\nYes, it is a false, hyperbolic comparison, but you and your mother were without blame for the abuse you both suffered. What happened to her was horrific, but it doesn\u2019t excuse her lifelong mistreatment of you.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your mom\u2019s fault her AH, criminal supposed friend attacked her, and it was NEVER your fault that your mother blamed you. Your mother chose to give you a life of a million cuts over decades and that ate at your self confidence and self worth, and left you struggling to figure out what you did wrong and how to fix it. You did nothing wrong.\n\nLive your life and surround yourself with people who treat you with love and respect, who see you, and who help lift you up when you start down the slope of self doubt. Spare no room in your world for people who drag you down, and who only give a BS non-apology because they want you to make them feel better about the abuse they perpetuated on you. Also, odds are the new partner is pushing the reconciliation.\n\nI wish you the best, and hope you find happiness with a found family of kind friends.", "I do, I blame her. My oldest son is the result of rape. He doesn't know and never will. I love him even though he looks like his sperm donor.

Trauma can fuck people up long term and make them unfit make logical decisions.\n\nIt's easy to say things like that when you're on the outside looking in. Things aren't so cut and dry in real life.\n\nThe mother have done better by her daughter, yes. Should she have gotten help and gone through the proper channels, yes. But again exceedingly traumatic events can screw up a person's brain so badly that logic is hard to come by.

I've seen it happen unfortunately.", "I wonder if OP should speak to the partner directly. Who know what kind of tales dear mother spins at home. Her partner deserves to know who she is raising a child with.", "I didn't know OP's mom was raped. I just read OP's comments. This is why I'm pro-choice. I probably would have given OP up for adoption in Op's mom's place.", "I absolutely have compassion for the mother. However, in 8 years of being a mother, I do expect even a traumatised person to get some sort of grasp on reality. I'm very much familiar with the effects trauma can have on the psyche, but when another life that depends on you is involved, that excuse just doesn't cut it.\nAnd even after 18 years she told her child she couldn't stand to see her. She learned nothing, even after giving up her child. She's done nothing to deserve forgiveness from OP. All she did was run away from her issues and unload them on an innocent child.", "Wow reading your story, you show pretty amazing empathy for your mother, which is good.\n\nI hope you had a reasonably good life with your grandmother.\n\nYour mother could use some therapy/more therapy because she needs to understand that you can hear the apology, but you need time to live it.  And that sometimes the hurt(intentional or not) is too much to forgive.  \n\nYou should be able to develop a relationship, if she stops trying to demand it be on her terms.  Which is what she's been doing all her life.  \n\nHow you came into existence doesn't negate that she chose to bear you, not put you up for adoption and then raise you(but passing you off to Gmother).  By doing that she \"signed\" up for certain obligations as a parent.  And you have a right to feel that she abrogated them.\n\nSo tell her you want to give her the chance to have a relationship with you.

Just as you were honest with her and told her you couldn\u2019t quite forgive her with her apology.

So that does make a difference here although I do think she is still making it all about her and does not realize that you also had trauma from her abandonment.
