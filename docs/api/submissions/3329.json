She has another daughter named Andy (4f) that she and her wife Ella (38f) had together shortly after they got married.\n\nI\u2019m not very close with my mom. My bio dad wasn\u2019t the best person, and I know that in her eyes, I was just a reminder of him. \nWhen I was 8, she sent me off to live with my grandmother, and really the only time I ever heard from her was when she\u2019d send money for me every few months.\n\nI spent a very large portion of my childhood wondering why she didn\u2019t want me, or why she never seemed to even like me. I would always create reasons as to why, convincing myself that I must have done something wrong. Before Andy was born, and my mother and I had sort of started to speak more than we had previously, my therapist suggested that I just sit my mom down and talk to her directly. Instead of wondering what the answers were, I could just hear them from the source.\n\nMy mom told me that she sent me to live with my grandmother because she couldn\u2019t stand being near me. Me being out of her sight made it easier for her to pretend I didn\u2019t exist, which then made it easier for her to go on with her life and heal.\nI don\u2019t blame her for feeling that way, like I said my bio dad isn\u2019t a good person, and I get why she couldn\u2019t handle being my mom. I don\u2019t necessarily forgive her because I was a kid and I deserved better but I also don\u2019t hold her totally responsible because I know she was going through a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much her wife Ella knows about our history, but she has been very clearly trying to get my mom and I to reconnect.\nI guess she wants me to know Andy. Maybe they both do, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nMy mom asked me to meet her for coffee to talk. While we were at the coffee place, she told me that she was sorry about how things played out between us, and that she hoped her apology was enough for me to forgive her. I said that it meant a lot to hear her say sorry, but that her saying it wasn\u2019t enough for me to just forgive and forget it all. I understand her and I empathize with her, but I can\u2019t forgive her.\n\nAfter I left, she ended up texting me and telling me how unfair I was being to tell her that her \u201csorry\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings.\nIn her last text she said that I didn\u2019t have to outright say I can\u2019t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself.\n\nI guess she\u2019s right. I definitely didn\u2019t have to say it, but I did.", "created_utc": 1669516312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5p66c/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_her_apology_isnt/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a mystery to me how parents can cause actual trauma to their children and then get mad when they're hold accountable for it. It's good that she's trying to reconnect but that doesn't mean you own her anything, that doesn't cancel how much she has hurt you!", "NTA, I don't get these people who seem to think saying \"Sorry\" entitles you to blanket immunity no matter what kind of horrible stuff you did, and abandoning a child is way up there. I don't know what your dad did to your mom, but what she did to you is unforgivable.", "NTA\n\nWhy does your mom think that this is about her?", "NTA, saying sorry doesn't magically fix things. If you break a plate and then tell it you are sorry you broke it, does the plate magically become whole again? No.", "NTA  my father drank a lot for years,  he said he was sorry -  his excuse was he blacked out a lot and didn't remember what he did.  I told he was lucky, I wasn't able to blackout and was forced to suffer with horrible memories, so no, your sorry doesn't cut it. It's good she said it, but that doesn't automatically mean you need to accept it. A true apology takes work, it's not just a quick \"sorry I destroyed you\" and let's move on. My father and I have worked for a few years and no, we'll never have that perfect relationship but it's much better than it was.", "Nta. Her reaction tells you she hasn't changed. She still lacks any real empathy for you. If you care enough make her go to therapy with you and see what happens. If not flick her... But maybe ensure Andy doesn't think it's her fault.", "NTA. I mean, I understand your mother struggled to get to the point of saying she was sorry, however, she isn't thinking of you or your feelings all throughout these years. She doesn't understand how her rejection affected you and how all those years in which you had to fabricate, so to speak, reasons for her not reaching out to you made you suffer. She is thinking only on herself, her feelings, her struggles and what have you, but she is not giving you the slightest thought and all the things you went through during the years in which she pretended you did not exist. Perhaps you should cut contact again until she is able to understand all of this.", "NTA, just because she healed from her hurt doesn't mean you healed from yours. A parent is by default responsible for their children's well being, full stop. You don't owe her anything, you wouldn't owe her anything if she raised you, which she didn't, which was 100% her choice. You never had a choice. You just take all the time you need and never feel like you can't speak your truth. Some people will threaten to withhold something they think you want in order to get their way, kinda sounds like your mother is making demands in order to give you the relationship she thinks you want.", "NTA at all. Your assessment of her actions is profoundly empathetic and kind, considering she abandoned you. Her excuse is insufficient (I have two children by two husbands \\[16 years apart\\], both of whom strongly resemble their abusive dads, and I did not abandon them). From what you said, all you\u2019re asking for is for her to acknowledge the depth of what she did. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s still being selfish. I hope you find all the love and acceptance you deserve.", "NTA but your mom is. This is NOT your fault. None of it. Not her staying away from you before and not y\u2019all\u2019s difficulty reconnecting now. She needs a shit ton of therapy to deal with her past and to stop putting her issues on you. And to be honest she may never get there. Her being sorry doesn\u2019t erase what she did to you. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. Her apology isn't enough. She deeply traumatized you, regardless of the read (I read your explanation). If she was truly sorry, she would give you time to process and see how the relationship might proceed. An apology is supposed to be for the one hurt. Your mother has made it about herself, so the apology was not sincere (she might have been hurt by your father, but that was not your fault).", "NTA. Your mom is, but mostly for her recent actions. \n\nAs someone whose mom also left, I can empathize with how you felt growing up. However, I don't blame her so much for that- it was probably better than her keeping and neglecting/abusing you. \n\nBut to waltz back in now, decades later, demanding your forgiveness and doing NOTHING to earn it, all for the sake of her new happy little family is selfish as fuck. If she wants a relationship with you, it's up to her to put the work in and you have every right to reject her. You owe her nothing. You were actually very kind in your reply and imo she didn't even deserve that kindness.", "Oh boy\n\nNTA\n\n- one can ASK for forgiveness, one is NOT ENTITLED to forgiveness \n\n- saying \"I'm sorry\" is not permission to hurt you again\n\n- apologies are not a quick one and done magic cure all, that automatically erases all past actions.\n\n- you were honest, without being harsh. And you are on your own healing journey. Maybe one day you both will be at the same chapter of this saga. But that does not mean your mother gets to decide IF and When that happens.", "NTA \n\nYour feelings  are valid. Your mother  abandoned you as a child. You felt it. It profoundly hurt you. It shook you to your core. It has, and it will, affect you for life.\n\nI would say that your mom wasn't the asshole when she sent you to live with your grandparents. Obviously, she was unable to care for you. While I could judge her for that, it isn't my place. It's absolutely okay for you to judge her through.\n\nIt is possible that she thought that your grandparents could provide you with the love and care that she was unable to give you. That is something that I don't know.\n\nThat was what I was leaning towards, until you shared her text messages.\n\nAs I said, your feelings are legitimate.  Your feelings are valid. Your mother can offer an apology. You don't have to accept it. You aren't obligated to accept it.\n\nYour mother's texts were insensitive. They were selfish. They didn't acknowledge your pain. They didn't acknowledge your experience. They didn't acknowledge that you feel rejected by her, and neither did her \"apology\". Again, your mother dismissed you. She dismissed your experience, she dismissed your pain, she dismissed abandoning you. \n\nHer apology wasn't enough.", "NTA, but she's lying, this has nothing to do with your dad and everything to her being lazy and just couldn't be bothered. I've never looked at my children and thought I don't want to raise these kids because they remind me of their Dad. Hell no these are my kids and he has nothing to do with it.", "*\"In her last text she said that I didn\u2019t have to outright say I can\u2019t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself\"*\n\nShe \"hoped her apology was enough to forgive her\".........it wasn\u2019t and you told her that.......WTF IS THE ISSUE?\n\nDon't ask questions you don't want answers too.\n\nIt's terrible that your bio dad traumatized your mom.\n\nBut **YOU ARE NOT HIM!!!!**\n\nYou got punished because he was your \"dad\".\n\nYour mom should feel extremely lucky that you're even willing to speak to her.\n\n*\"She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings\"*\n\nYeah.....tough shit, how do you think YOUR DAUGHTER felt when her mom abandoned her? Do you think that didn\u2019t \"hurt her feelings\"?.....PATHETIC!!!\n\nInstead of crying about it, She should ask you how YOU want to try and (re)build a relationship.\n\nNTA at all and you wouldn\u2019t be one if you never spoke to her again either.", "NAH.

There is only rebuilding the trust she destroyed. It will take time, and it will take her deciding to be there.

You don't owe your mother a thing; it is her who owes you, not just an apology, but actually owning up to the fact that she abandoned you and she pretended you did not exist. Does she realize the enormity of this? She doesn't. She had her issues, however, those issues affected and traumatized you. She had her issues, but there was no reason for you to pay for them. The fact that she is still making you feel that you screwed up means she hasn't acknowledged that her issues, in which you had no part whatsoever, affected you big time.
