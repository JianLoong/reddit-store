For me, yes, this is a deal breaker, ESPECIALLY refusing to wash his hands before 'playtime'.   You're not expecting him to wear gloves or even shower.  You're just asking that he wash his hands before sex and cooking and not wear his outside clothes into your bed (which is a HUGE deal for anyone with allergies to pollen/etc that floats around in the air).  Those are reasonable limits.", "nah thats gross me personally thats a big red flag that he keeps trying to gaslight you into thinking that your personal hygiene is not worth his time.", "NTA. For me that\u2019s a dealbreaker.", "NTA. He\u2019s a dirty person.", "NTA. That dude has got some horrific hygiene habits.. plus the gaslighting.. end it. He sounds like the worst.", "NTA! He's disgusting. He can spread multiple diseases or give you UTIs, BV, etc by not washing his hands.", "Some of those would be a bit much for me, but I'd break up with asap as soon as I learned a man doesn't even watch his hands after using the bathroom! So gross!", "NTA!  You should not be begging someone to wash their hands!  You deserve way more!  If he even had an ounce of sympathy for you, he'd wash his hands a little more often just to make you feel better.  And I don't want to hear anyone say \"well he doesn't HAVE to wash his hands.\"  No, he doesn't HAVE to, but it's basic courtesy.  Is having clean hands before sex too much to ask?", "NTA. He wants to use his hands to touch your body, you get to insist that they have to be clean hands.", "He\u2019s the asshole, not you. Absolutely disgusting. Some things are dirtier than others, eww.", "nope, he\u2019s being really dumb here. You are NTA", "Omg, ditch him. That's just plain nasty. NTA. You deserve a lot better and a whole lot cleaner, lol", "I'm on the fence because I don't know *how infrequently* he washes his hands or specifically when he doesn't wash. I'm going to be assume that he's washing very little, and not washing in the situations where he criticizes you for washing (e.g. after the toilet).\n\nBased on those assumptions, NTA. Personal hygiene is a thing for a reason, and when he manages to make himself sick by failing to wash his hands, there are very good chances that you'll catch it. I think this no-handwashing business would be a deal-breaker for me, too.\n\nAlso ... this wasn't your question, but I just can't let it go by. *Do the do*? What the what? You know, you can say \"have sex\" in here. We've heard it before; we can handle it. If you can't, you might want to have a think about your readiness for a sexual relationship.", "NTA. Please tell me this guy doesn\u2019t work in food service of any kind. That would violate all sorts of health codes, dear god. \nAlso he could give you a horrible infection - please take care of yourself and end things with this guy if he refuses to perform basic hygiene before touching you intimately. His BS in the face of your very reasonable request is troubling, to say the least.", "NTA, this is absolutely a deal breaker! He's nasty, how many UTIs are you going to suffer through? OH! If he doesn't wash his hands, does he wash his bits?!", "NTA I love that my partner is a nurse. His hands are very clean always. He even works on cars and yard work with gloves.", "NTA and neither is he. You both need to move on and find people you\u2019re compatible with.\nI am, however, really tempted to call everyone an ass hole that uses the made up term \u201csituationship\u201d.", "You're a clean person. A very clean person. Probably just a touch on the excessive side (imo) BUTTTTTTT that's completely your choice and honestly more people should take a little (or a lot!!!!) more consideration for our hygiene. This is a red flag to me and clearly I don't think you two are compatible in any sort of long term thing. You might be compatible for fuckin' of course but I know you can't stop thinking about how unclean he is lol NTA", "Is he a hippie? This guy must be a hippie, surely\n\nNTA", "people have different standards of cleanliness and view the world differently.\n\nit's not an AH/NAH thing. It's just a compatibility thing. Maybe you're not compatible due to cleanliness differences. \n\nJust because your relationship ends doesn't mean someone was an AH. Relationships just end due to lack of compatibility sometimes.  He just needs to date someone who is also disgusting.", "Ehhh NAH washing your hands before sexy time and after using the bathroom, absolutely. Washing your hands every time  you get home is a bit excessive imo", "NAH. i dont see it as a reason to break up with someone. you sound like you are just a germaphobe, which is not a bad thing. Though if it drives you that crazy then break up with him.  i don't think you being an AH by telling him to wash his hands before he cooks for you. However before he touches you is a little much, especially if he's not dirty. I am sure your phone and your keyboard you typed this with are a million times dirtier than his hands", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
