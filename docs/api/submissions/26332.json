You look like you're getting fat.\" \n\nI get this all the time. He will not stop. \n\nOnce, we were at a party and he kept pestering me to tell him how much I weighed in a room full of people. \"You look like you've gained weight. How much do you weigh?\" Over and over when I didn't answer. Finally, I said, for the first time, \"I don't like it when you make comments on my body and weight. I don't do that to you or anyone else. There's no reason for you to do that to me.\"\n\nHe got offended and said he wasn't making comments on my body, but then he let it drop. I thought I finally got through to him, until this time.\n\nI am a few months post-partum. I'm working on getting rid of the mommy pouch, but even so, I've only gained five pounds from my normal pre-pregnancy weight. The entire family met up (parents, grandparents, aunt, cousins) and in front of all of them he says out of nowhere, \"you've gotten really fat.\"\n\nIt was embarrassing and irritating. I said \"why won't you stop saying stuff like that to me? I told you I don't like comments on my body.\"\n\nHe replied all innocent saying that he didn't mean any harm. That he's my father and he says it because he \"worries\" about me, and it's his job to check up on my health. No one in the room spoke up to defend me, because they never have and never will. Everyone else laughs it off when does it to them. They don't care what he says, and ultimately, I don't care either because I'm comfortable in my body no matter what he says.\n\nI know in his way, this is how he shows care.

Because he is going to do the same thing to your child.", "This is how he shows care..?\nI am baffled, NTA, is this really fine for you as a love language??", "NTA\n\nLoudly say, \u201cit\u2019s weird when a relative keeps looking at my body non-stop and commenting on how he\u2019d prefer it to look. That\u2019s really creepy. Especially because you\u2019re my father. Quit being gross.\u201d", "NTA. your father is emotionally abusive. this is not how he shows he cares.", "You are NOT too sensitive. Your father is just TA.\nHe has bullied, demeaned and shamed you your entire life. The only weight you need to lose is whatever your so-called father is.\n\nThe real question is, what will you do if he does it to your child? Do you want your baby to be bullied from infancy? Time for no contact.", "The next time he does it, ask him straight up without batting an eye if the reason he bullies you is because his mom or dad bullied him and it's all he knows? Then tell him because that's the only reason that makes sense and that \"he can break the cycle\".  Say it with the utmost concern and loud enough for others to hear.  A bully always backs down when confronted amf and embarrassed.  He needs to learn this.", "NTA. Is your dad physically flawless like some kind of god- aquiline nose, killer cheekbones chiseled jaw, rock hard abs, bulging biceps, muscular thighs, etc? I doubt it. Even if he was, he still has no right to speak negatively on your body, especially when you've never even been overweight! You could comment on how wrinkled, old, gray, balding, or paunchy he looks, and suggest he dye his hair, get a toupee, \"Botox it Up\" or have plastic surgery if he's so fixated on looks. Say you could start a Go Fund Me page for his much needed makeover. See how he reacts.  Or keep mimicking his questions or comments \"How much do YOU weigh? You look like you're getting fat\".Or just keep stating how you don't want his unwanted criticism on your perfectly normal appearance and just walk away..", "Nope. Don't you do that. Don't you give him an out, make an excuse and soft landing for his terrible behavior. That is not him showing he cares--he does not believe \"you've gotten fat\" is a caring comment. And in a crowded room.\n\nHe's a bully and a narcissistic one at that, and keeps doing it bc everyone let's him. He likes that it bothers you. \n\nYou need to decide how you want to protect your peace and handle this going forward. You know he'll behave this way to your child(ren) too, right? \n\n Personally I'm the type to return energy, so I'd start asking the same type of questions with fake concern. Loudly. In crowded rooms full of people he knows.\" Are you loosing your hair? It looks like you're losing your hair. Have you akwqys had that bald spot? Babe, doesn't it look like Dad's going bald?  What? No, I'm just worried about you.  Don't be silly, that didn't hurt your feelings. It's just like when you tell me I'm fat. Its love\". Pick the pain point of your choice. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThat's just me tho, and probably not the healthiest approach.  But OP, please don't write this off as love and don't just keep taking it.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit:I loathe autocorrect \n\nOther edit: words", "Could you try flipping the script on him?  When he makes comments like that  \"remind\" him that you've talked to him about his bad manners MANY times-- then turn to the others in the room and in a \"stage whisper\" sigh and say \"He keeps forgetting more and more.  We really need to contact his doctor about a screening for Alzheimer's.", "NTA tell him your mother said he has a small wiener.", "You know you're NTA.. this should be in /r/relationship_advice", "This is not the way your father shows care; it's the way he hurts you, insults you, and tries to undermine your sense of self-confidence.\n\nYou have already told your father to stop and why; he refuses.  \n\nI assure you that any adult man on the planet is aware that telling a woman she looks fat is a horrible thing to say to her.  Not a way of showing love.\n\nI would suggest that you go NC.  You don't need to be around someone who keeps criticizing and hurting you.  (Nor does your child.  If this is a girl child, can you even imagine what he's going to say to her and the impact it's going to have?)\n\nNTA", "Worry: Pulls you aside in private and says he wants to make sure everything is fine and that he's there if you're not.  Like actually showing honest concern.\n\nNot worry: abusing you verbally privately and in public about something.    And ignoring your repeated requests to stop.  That's not parental concern.\n\nNTA", "Nta. He seems weirdly fixated on weight. Is he neurodivergent? That kind of behavior is not normal. The only person I know who worries that much about other people's weight has aspergers", "NTA; your dad needs to shut the fuck up. I, a tiny 5-foot-tall twink, am heavier than you. I mean, not by much, but STILL!\nMake sure he knows you will not tolerate any bullshit, especially if he moves on to your kid.\n\nThis behavior is unacceptable, and I guarantee the others are just laughing because they\u2019re too uncomfortable to protest.", "NYA, and if this is how he shows he cares, you should reciprocate to show your love.

NTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve asked him to stop. You\u2019ve told him to stop. He knows you hate it. You\u2019re not being too sensitive, he\u2019s being an asshole. \n\nEvery time he says something like that you leave. Hang up the phone. Temp block his number. He gets put on time out. You don\u2019t even have to tell him what you\u2019re doing, just grab your kid and your bag and be elsewhere. You can start small, like go into another room, but gathering the baby and heading home also works. Do it Every Time.  If he cares and wants you at the family gatherings, he will figure out how to handle his own mouth. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have anyone that will kick his ass out of your house, he doesn\u2019t get to come over anymore. This you can be upfront about \u201cDad, you can come over as long as you do not mention my weight or body size at all. Can you do that or should you stay home?\u201d If (when) he slips up, \u201cDad, it\u2019s time for you to leave.\u201d Then go into another room with the baby.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to say that shit to you. He can say it to the air, but you\u2019re not there for it.

My Dad used to do this too he would comment on my weight before even saying hello. I decided if he could do it so could I. He'd make a comment on my body so we d return with gosh looks like you've lost more hair, or has your beer gut gotten bigger? Not surprisingly he replied how hurtful my comments were. I said yeah not a good look to comment on people's bodies huh? I'll stop if you do.", "NTA\n\nDon't know if it would work for you but one time when my dad mentioned me being fat, I told him that he was bald...", "NTA. Good job speaking up for yourself.  Next time, consider walking out (or making him leave) after calling him out for being mean and hurtful.  Might also try turning the tables, I\u2019m sure dad is showing his age.  \u201cBaldy\u201d as a nickname, or \u201c\u2018my doctor says my weight is fine, what does your doctor say about your spare tire\u201d.

It is not concern if he asks EVERY TIME he sees you. That is not concern, that is bullying. Not that this should matter but I highly doubt that OP's weight fluctuates so much in between seeing her dad that he truly needs to comment on it.
