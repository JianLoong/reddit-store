Next time get the plate tho and call the non-emergency line to report this guy, this was harassment and you deserve better than this and so does everyone is in the neighborhood.", "NTA, guy was an asshole for the way he was interacting with you - even the catholic church is starting to change their position on the gays", "NTA. Christians won't stop shoving their religion down everyone's throats, they need to be able to take the same. You tried to be polite and keep your religion to yourself, but he wasn't having it. He deserved worse, and good for you.", "Nta", "NTA a grown-ass man mistreating a minor is pretty on brand for some faiths.He can GTFO with his hateful fandom. Driving around in van trying to get a teen to do something he wants \u2014 gross.", "Random holy men driving around in a van, pulling over and accosting you, (dubious behavior, I\u2019m sorry, can we say serial killer vibes?), and questioning your belief system- deserve to be spoken to quite frankly.\n\nSucks for them if they don\u2019t like what you had to say. You didn\u2019t pull over and bother *them* as they were going about their daily business. NTA\n\nAnd as I like to say, \u201cYea, I\u2019m going to hell.

My Dad's a priest. Folks like this guy DO give the rest of Christianity a bad name, and you were completely right to tell him that.", "NTA-  Unless God told him in that moment that you are going to Hell I\u2019d say he\u2019s an unreliable source.  I think you said exactly the right thing when you pointed out that people like him give the religion a bad name.  Besides. What is his goal?  Because if it is recruitment and he just ran you off I\u2019d bet he\u2019s closer to Hell than you are.    Maybe next time point out that you were seriously considering Christianity until he got out of the van to lose his ever loving mind.  Now it\u2019s no thanks and not a chance!", "NTA. Not at all.

As I said in another comment, he had a southern accent so he was maybe a traveling preacher. And he decided to randomly harass a minor bc what else is new?", "Don't I wish", "Of course! I\u2019m queer as well, it\u2019s an uphill battle but this guy was definitely crazy. I\u2019m proud of you!", "He\u2019s an actual threat to safety. Harassing kids for no good reason.", "Thanks", "Seriously. It\u2019d be one thing to do that to an adult. But to a kid? Highly inappropriate."]}
