{"id": 14694, "submission_id": "12kh9v9", "title": "AITA for ignoring my cousin after not being invited to the wedding?", "selftext": "Sorry this is a long post but some quick context: prior to about a year ago, my cousin (30M) and I (25F) had a distant relationship. My dad\u2019s extended family are very traditional and had certain views on non-white people and how a woman should behave. My mum (being not white) was not very welcome at gatherings so we spent limited time with them. When I was 18, my grandparents found out I had a girlfriend and that was the nail in the coffin for our relationship with them and the rest of the family. My parents went almost entirely no-contact.\n\nAbout a year ago, my cousin reached out to chat. He was planning on introducing his fianc\u00e9 (31F) to the family prior to the wedding but wanted to ask me to help prep her on the expectations and etiquette she would need when she met them. She was also not-white so he was hoping I could provide some advice on how to navigate that with family members. \n\nI said yes and we set up bi-weekly chats for us to meet so I could help prep her and provide advice. We started meeting outside of those sessions as well just to chat and grab lunch. I didn\u2019t have any female cousins and was never close to my male ones so it was really lovely to have a family connection. \n\nAfter about 6 months of prepping, he introduced her to the family and it seemed to go okay (according to my cousin: some minor comments about her \u201cupbringing\u201d). The three of us continued to spend time together pretty frequently for another 5-6 months. At this point, it was only 4 months prior to the wedding. They hadn\u2019t really mentioned it to me in a while so I asked if it was still happening on that day. They said they were still getting married then but wouldn\u2019t be able to invite me to the wedding because my presence would make the family \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and the family did not want them to have continued contact with me. My cousin and his fianc\u00e9 told me that we could still meet from time to time, they just can\u2019t really let the family know. I was hurt so I left the restaurant pretty quickly after and haven\u2019t reached out to them in a few weeks.\n\nHowever, I think I may have overreacted. I have only had a good relationship with my cousin for a year, so it\u2019s a lot to expect him to put at risk relationships with the rest of our family for me. But at the same time, I still feel really hurt and angry.

Wait wait wait. Hold the phone. Your cousin uses you to instruct his wife on how to deal with your family. Since you're a lesbian they won't invite you to your wedding? Oh excuse me? Like what?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for how they treated you. But think about this... Do you really want to keep contact with people that is ashamed of you? Because that's basically what's happening. They're ashamed about the family knowing they're talking to you.\n\nTell them to go to hell.", "NTA  \nHe gets to invite who he likes, but he deliberately snubbed you to stay on his family's good side, after you did all that for him.\n\nIf you still want a relationship after this, that's your prerogative, but if you don't, that's completely right. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA\n\nThe nerve of them to reach out for advice on how to navigate the family that shunned you, then shun you in turn. The. Absolute. Nerve.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d say you underreacted. They used you, plain and simple.", "So he used you to teach his non-white fiance to be properly subservient, then went back to shunning you like the rest of the family?\n\nFuck that.  I'd never speak to him again.  You're NTA.", "Doesn't sound like you're mad because you're not invited to the wedding, but rather because of the reason why you're not invited to the wedding. \n\nThey want a relationship with you, but only if it's kept in secret. That's high up there on the AH spectrum. \n\nNTA.", "Bless OP and the fiancee's heart. \n\nAs two women of color, they really sat down and discussed how to to make the fiancee passable and conform to the racist standards of a bunch of racists..... and laid out ettiquette for how a POC can make racists comfortable with their mere existence as a non-white person....\n\nI may be blunt, but the fiancee needs to get some self respect and YTA to yourself OP for even wanting to subject yourself to attend a wedding filled with people who hate you because you aren't white nor straight... I mean, the groom asked you to help him stuff his fiancee into a white pleasing box and you happily went along with it. That's just sad. F the groom and F that family... He sounds no better than the lot of them.", "So you\u2019re cousin basically just used you and dumped you once you served your purpose to them wow\nNTA", "NTA - this sucks so badly - your cousin must have known all along that he wasn\u2019t going to invite you but didn\u2019t even talk to you about it. Was he just never going to say anything? If the family is uncomfortable then that\u2019s their problem and not a good enough reason not to invite you so yeah I don\u2019t blame you for being angry. Also had your cousin tried to contact you since? If not you have your answer.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing that 'very traditional' is a polite way of saying 'f#cking bigots and c#nts'\n\nYou are better without any of them in your life, or anyone who thinks their opinion is worth more than their own.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin and his wife are garbage. You're better off without them. Maintain radio silence indefinitely.\n\nThey'll come around sooner or later crying about how mean the rest of the family is. Something will happen, it will shock them for some unknown reason, and they'll turn to you for support... again. That's when you have to choose which path to take. Not now. They're not even sorry, so there's nothing more to say now. It's when they need another lifeline that you'll have to choose. \n\nIf it were me, I'd give them the loudest silence I could manage. If they text, read it, don't reply, but don't block either. If they call, send it to voice mail every time.  If they send a letter, mark it return to sender and write a big question mark on it. If they show up at your door, blank expression, and maintain eye contact while slooooowly shutting the door in their face.", "NTA. Your cousin is TA for asking you to help his fiancee with expectations knowing he wasn't going to invite you to their wedding. He and fiancee are users.", "Nta.  They used you and it's ok to feel bad about it.  Going forward use their behavior towards you as a guide. So no wedding invite? Great.  You will have time form them when you have time for them.  In like 5 years.  If ever.", "NTA-- They totally used you.  Used you to gain insight on the family, and dumped you when they had what they wanted.\n\nThink of a person at school who is popular, but it would only be your friend at home when there's no students around from school to see.\n\nThat's what they did.  Juvenile and mean what they did was.", "INFO Wait your family is so racist that your cousin thought his fianc\u00e9 needed \"classes\" to prep with dealing with them? Something your cousin didn't handle him self by shutting down the family. The family makes racist comments and he doesn't invite you and she still wants to marry him?", "I learned a phrase on here that\u2019s apparently pretty common. \u201cIf 10 people are sitting at a table and 9 are racist, there\u2019s 10 racists sitting at the table \u201c. I believe that statement to be true. He doesn\u2019t like the fact that you\u2019re lesbian. My mother didn\u2019t approve of being gay or lesbian for religious reasons. Her one cousin was gay. Because of his age we called him uncle. We saw him more than anyone else in the family including her parents and siblings (she had 12 siblings and I don\u2019t know how many cousins). He was always invited to my parents\u2019 parties. He always came along with his boyfriend and sometimes some of his gay friends. My mother was always very friendly to them. My stepdad doesn\u2019t care what a person\u2019s sexual orientation is so he had no problems with them being there. He provided Canadian Windsor as the alcohol. If you wanted something different you had to bring your own. He also drank his drinks very strong. Anyone who liked them that way he made them for those guests. I never once saw our uncle and his friends ever make their own drinks. They were happy people. What I took from this (as anyone should) is you don\u2019t have to agree or like someone\u2019s choices to be good to them. My mother also never spoke against gays or lesbians unless someone else specifically brought it up to get her opinion. If you can\u2019t be at the wedding because of your lifestyle, then you\u2019re not being accepted for who you are by your cousin!", "\u2026 No, just no. Your cousin was using you to prep his fianc\u00e9, now that you have done so he could give 2 fucks about you. \n\nYour family sucks and you can do way better without them. \n\nNTA", "NTA for your feelings. \n\nYou get admiration points for making some effort to re-establish a relationship with some extended family members. There are always hard-to-predict potential benefits to extending your network of friends and relatives. Contacts like that can pay off in many possible ways in the future. \n\nIt is unpleasant when someone we are developing a relationship with shows us we do not mean quite as much to them as we thought we did. Your positive relationship of a year did not pay off in your cousin deciding to strain some of his family relationships by inviting you nor did it make some of his relatives non-racist. I am sure you are not surprised at the latter. But you are hurt that your efforts did not achieve the former.\n\nSo you have hurt feelings and you can do one of two things: cut off relations with your cousin or continue the distant relationship you have based on hoping it will strengthen over time, and still yield some future benefits. Plenty of redditors will tell you to cut 'em off!, but i would suggest there may still be value to you in continuing to see him. Over time, he may actually influence the expressions of racism in some of his other relatives, though you may or may not see this. Good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
