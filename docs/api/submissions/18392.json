What does she want you to do while you\u2019re both trying to sleep? \n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s very caring to leave people alone when their body is revolting against them. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nTell her she has it tough, but you need comfortable sleep as well. If she can't understand that, tough luck buddy.", "I'm surprised she would even want you in bed! When I'm sick with ANYTHING, I just want to be alone in bed where I can be my miserable self without bothering anyone else. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI prefer to be left alone when sick.  That's just me.\n\nI had food poisoning.  I slept in the bathroom. It was a hell of a lot easier than literally crawling there for the next 48 hours.", "Eww.  NTA.  Buy her a bottle of Pepto Bismol.", "NTA.  You need to be able to sleep.  It's not that you don't care.  It's that you also need sleep.", "NTA.  Sometimes you have to sleep alone.", "NTA, it's not sanitary to be around someone who is sick. If you're too close to someone with food poisoning you could wake up with vomit on you or get it as well.", "NTA.", "If she doesn't need your presence and hasn't asked for your support than you are NTA, you are entitled to your comfortable sleep and if your feelings for her are being questions because of this there is probably a degree of frailty to your relationship if that's all it takes to question its validity. \n\nHowever, if she did ask those things then it's up to you if you can meet her expectations. Whether or not you are an asshole for not wanting to support her while she is sick really depends on your relationship and your interpersonal expectations of eachother.", "NTA- needing to sleep restfully when there is literally no way to be helpful is not uncaring.\n\nIf I am that sick,  I take the couch because I want some privacy &  don't want to disturb my husband or risk an \"incident\" in our bed (our sofa has easily cleaned slipcovers) and it's more convenient for me, being closer to both the kitchen & a bathroom.", "NTA - Stay on the couch. You being in bed doesn't mean you care more. Just like being on the couch doesn't mean you care less. Plus, why would she want to subject you to that?\n\nGet her some meds and take care of her.", "NTA. I bet she\u2019s the type that says if you love me you will smell the fetid odor my orifices produces!  Horrible!", "NTA. What does she mean you don't care? She wants you to lay there and suffer and lose sleep for what? She can't handle spending a couple nights in a bed alone being sick? If anything, when I'm sick like that, I appreciate the space and bed to myself.", "Your gf is not angry; if you are living together, you are likely serious, and now she is wondering if this person she lives with is long-term or marriage material.\n\nLife is messy.  A long term relationship is going to have to put up with a lot worse than two days of puke or rancid farts.  There is a reason the traditional vows include \u201c**in sickness** or in health\u201d.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, necessarily, because without the context of the seriousness of the relationship it is hard to tell if either of you is being unreasonable.  It\u2019s possible you are, but it\u2019s also possible in some combinations that she should have offered you to move to spare you the discomfort, asking you just to be on call if something got particularly bad.\n\nSo no judgement for the bot; just keep in mind that as relationships move past the initial phrase, these are the sorts of things non-asshole couples have to figure out, if their relationship is going to last.", "NAH.", "NAH but I do see an incompatibility issue with how you handle closeness during illness that will likely pop up again.", "NTA food poisoning is also contagious so beware.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or in a hotel. Or on mars. I don't blame you for not wanting to sleep with Mount Vesuvius, for fear of eruption, but she's sick so she's probably be a bit more emotional than usual (puking your brains out will do that). She probably already feels pretty gross so having you want to sleep on the couch is probably driving that point home for her.

I felt like I had the flu. I wouldn\u2019t want to sleep in a bed with someone that had that either. It\u2019s also contagious since it\u2019s a type of harmful bacteria. I am pretty sure I got it from touching something and then touching my eyes/nose/mouth.", "I mean, if there is genuinely a smell and she doesn't even brush teeth after vomiting, you're fine to sleep on your own.\n\nWith that being said, my husband cared for me when I was sick to my stomach multiple times which never lasted for more than 24 hours. Several days is a stretch here. Does she need to go to the hospital?! Because that sounds like way worse than even my worse food poisoning.", "Sheesh... Okay, clearly different strokes for different folks - I can't stand the smell/taste of vomit on my own breath and HAVE to brush my teeth afterwards otherwise it's just going to make me start gagging again. The farting thing... Can't be helped.\n\nNTA. And tell your GF toothpaste works wonders for bat-breath.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is feeling miserable and you can\u2019t get past a little disgust in order to comfort her?

I went from 100% fine to violently vomiting and doubled over in pain in less than 10 minutes.\n\nMy husband stripped the blanket, got me a bucket to throw up in.  Then he got the blanket in the washer, got me into an uber and to the hospital. \n\nHe got me a emesis bag from the nurse and held it for me.  He stayed with me through the morphine and the vomiting.  And the extra vomiting caused by the morphine before the Zofran kicked in. He went home to sleep finally at 4 AM.\n\nThat, my friend, is love and care. \n\nYou aren't even doing the bare minimum.", "This. \n\nWhen I'm sick, I request my husband to get away.

The term is kind of a catch-all for anything you eat that makes you sick (excluding allergies ofc.)\n\nC diff is contagious, for example, and you can catch it from food contaminated by someone else with an active infection.
