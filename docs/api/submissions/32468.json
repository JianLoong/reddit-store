{"id": 32468, "submission_id": "18c1h3i", "title": "AITA for saying no to dogs at Christmas?", "selftext": "TLDR: I said no dogs in the house at Christmas, so half the family aren't coming.\n\nSo, there's been a long running tension in our family around my Mum's dogs for many years. They're always badly behaved, some have been aggressive and there's an expectation that we should just tolerate them when we visit. \n\nAfter I had children, I was no longer comfortable doing this. We didn't see her often, as she lived 2 hours away, but when my kid was small, one of the big dogs started jumping up and nipping me on the shoulder, so then I refused to be in the same room, or to let my kid near them (he was about 18 months at the time). \n\nMy kid is now 5 and I have an 8 month old. My Mum recently moved back into the area and she has tried to have the dogs in the same area as the kids when we visited my Grandma, by keeping them on a lead, but they were barking at my eldest and he was scared of them, so I ask for them to be put in another room.\n\nI usually host Christmas at mine, as my Grandma and Great-Aunt are almost 90 and can't really do a lot of cooking and organising now. Now that my Mum has moved nearby, she's invited too. She agreed a couple of months ago that it would be ok for the dogs to come and stay in the car (a really large range rover) and we would take them for a walk after Christmas dinner.\n\nNow she's challenged this, saying that the dogs would be cold, so I considered that they could come into the porch, but not be in the house (my house is really small btw, we just have a porch, a living room and kitchen downstairs). I feel like it's going to be stressful enough having two small kids and doing Christmas dinner. \n\nIn addition to this, my Husband dislikes the dogs and my MIL says she's was so scared of them last time they were around, she almost called the police...so my hands are pretty tied anyway.\n\nI told her that my rule still stands and she accused me of cruelty, said that I look down on her, that I don't care about her feelings, that I don't know what it's like to be her (she's currently living in a caravan on her friend's land). I do feel bad for her, but I'm not sure what else I can do and feel like I'm always in the position of having to bend my own boundaries and make everyone else uncomfortable to suit her needs.\n\nNow my Great-Aunt and Grandma have said that if my Mum decides not to come, they'll not come either, as they don't think she should be alone at Christmas. I'm really disappointed because I like making them a nice Christmas dinner and having them there with the kids, having a bit of fun and spending time together. I see that every Christmas might be the last for the older ones and try to make it nice for them.\n\nI'm so sad that Christmas has been ruined for half the people in the family because the other half doesn't want those dogs in the house. \n\nBtw, I would be fine if the dogs were more placid and not scary.\n\nAm I the asshole for putting my foot down on this issue and ruining Christmas?", "created_utc": 1701860132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c1h3i/aita_for_saying_no_to_dogs_at_christmas/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My other dog (small too) LOVES kids and likes the action of them being rambunctious. I still don't allow her to be out of reach when interacting with kids because shit happens.

Either way though that's your call though, I just dislike that overall mindset but I get it, I was there too.

Especially with her bringing up her current struggles, I might be reading too much into it but you don't sound close at all? Not that it's your responsibility, a relationship goes both ways, (and tbh it's 80%-90% on the parent's shoulders if you ask me).  \n\n\nBut if you don't have that solid of a relationship with your mum, you can just, not have her over anyway, save some drama you know? It just felt like you 2 are on such different wave lengths. But again I'm going off of limited info, but this feels like a deeper issue than just the dogs if you get what I mean? I think this dog situation probably just brought a lot of things to the surface.   \n\n\nMaybe I'm reading too much into it.", "YTA. dogs are better behaved than children, and far cuter. have fun at your sad lonely party", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
