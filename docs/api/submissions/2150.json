We would get a certain amount for various tasks. We were told when we turned 16, the accounts would be used to buy cars. My brother always put any money he got from birthdays and holidays in as well. Two years ago, my brother turned 16 and got his car.\n\nMy sixteenth birthday was three days ago. I thought I would have less money than my brother, because I wasn't as good as he was about putting gift money in. But I had more, a lot more. My brother asked how on earth I had that much. My mom said the money came from our old neighbor. She used to live with her daughter, who is still our neighbor, but she died.\n\nI don't remember her very well, but I used to go over to their yard and sit and talk to her or read to her. I used to be really into fairies and magic as a little kid, and I made up stories about fairies that lived in the trees in our yard and the neighbor's yard. She was the only one that ever wanted to hear them, because, well, they were pretty silly and stupid stories. Apparently she left a little money for me when she died, and her daughter wrote a check to me and gave it my parents. They put it in my account.\n\nNeither my brother nor I could believe it. First of all, our neighbor died eight years ago, so that money has been sitting and collecting interest that whole time. There was no way my brother would ever have been able to keep up, no matter how many chores he did. He exploded about how unfair it was. Our parents said we needed to honor our neighbor's wish, so that was that.\n\nMy brother asked me to share with him, saying how unfair it was that I got more money than him for doing something I wanted to do and liked to do, when he did a lot of hard work, like mowing lawns, cleaning gutters and all. I said no, because he already has his car and doesn't need a new one. Besides, like our parents said, our neighbor wanted me to have the money. He called me a greedy B and said I don't deserve to have a nicer car than him, and he hopes I crash it.\n\nI do know that technically it's unfair, but she wanted me to have it.

Frankly your parents are the real AHs here for not dealing with this situation much better rather than just letting it come as a complete surprise to everyone.  Given you were only 8 or younger during the time you spent with the neighbour it really isn't the same as the money for chores and it's not 'earned' (although I'm not diminishing the impact you obviously had on your neighbour to have been moved to leave it to you - you obviously had a lovely relationship and you made her happy).  If I had been the parents I would have managed that money differently.  \n\nBut now, given its a complete windfall for you, it really would be kind to share it with your brother.  And YWBTA to say that you *can't* because you need to honour your neighbour's wishes - that's complete crap.

It\u2019s OP\u2019s money, they should do whatever THEY want with it. \n\nAlso why should OP share with someone that called her a greedy B and wishes she would crash her new car just because he didn\u2019t get any money? \n\nGiving in to him with only hinder his view of the world, he will believe that everything in life needs to be fair when, majority of the time, it isn\u2019t.", "You want her to spend her money and time on someone who calls her a greedy bitch and hopes she crashes her car?", "NTA and please stop believing that it's unfair. It's not. You got that money because someone found you kind and funny and enjoyed their time with you. It's an inheritance, basically. Not everyone gets one, not everyone in the same family gets one. That doesn't mean you're under any obligation to share it.\n\nWhen people leave money to others, they do so for their own reasons and aren't obligated to spread it around. It was your neighbor's choice and you're honoring it.\n\nNow you're brother is learning a good lesson in capitalism: just because you do more labor doesn't mean you get more money. And also that labor isn't the only way to do something worthy in the world. You spent that time with the neighbor because you wanted to, with no expectation of financial return. She clearly appreciated your company! For that alone you should keep every cent!", "NTA. Fairness or unfairness is completely irrelevant to this situation.  That money was left to you for what you did for that lady. Your brother has nothing to do with that and has absolutely no claim to your money.  Does he think that if you got a well-paid job that he'd be entitled to a cut of your salary too?  Ridiculous", "It is not \"technically unfair\".  It is totally fair.

He made choices that resulting in him earning the money he should have. And you made different choices that resulted in you getting money for different reasons.

Maybe it wasn\u2019t how this was planned to happen but life hardly ever goes as planned. Why would you share the money? Did he spend time with that lady?

As some other Redditors have said, don\u2019t blow all of it on a car. Consider getting something of equal value to your brothers car. Maybe I\u2019m on Reddit too much, but your brother might vandalize a nicer car out of anger/jealousy.

Reading to her, telling her stories she made up all by herself, about faeries in the garden, no less! My cheeks hurt from smiling just imagining it! OP, you made that woman's life a little brighter, you brought whimsy and fantasy to life for her again, don't ever think for one instant that that was anything less than pure magic, she knew it, and she wanted to make sure she reminded you just how special that time was for her.  You earned every cent of that gift just by being you. They say \"be the change you want to see in the world\", well, I want to see more of your kind of change in the world, where people who very much need each other, find each other, through caring, kindness, and beautiful faery stories.

He doesn't have the empathy, awareness, or life experience,  needed to really understand why you deserve that windfall, but hopefully he grows up to learn it. Maybe let him read some of these comments.", "I mean we don't know how much money it is, but don't blow it on a brand new shiny car.

There\u2019s a lesson for her brother - that being kind to others pays off as well. Intead of being competitive and jelaous at others, he should start practicing kindness. Calling someone greedy b and wishing their car to crash should not be rewarded!!!", "Agreed. All this teaches the brother is that if he makes enough noise and threats, his sister and parents will capitulate to his demands.\n\nI would\u2019ve gone N A H because the brother is entitled to his feelings, but then he had to wish death and injuries on his sister, so OP is NTA.", "I wouldn't have kept it a secret and I wouldn't have it in the account that apparently had nothing other than chore and birthday money in it.  It's the secrecy/surprise that has made this difficult for everyone to navigate.  Obviously neither kid seemed to know the balance of their accounts until they turned 16.  That's a bit weird tbh - it's great to teach kids to save but a bit weird to do it without them seeing their savings grow and isn't really teaching them how to handle money.    OP hasn't said how much it is so I don't know exactly what I would have done.   But given the kids were 8 and 10 when the neighbour died just dumping it in the chore account without telling anyone was just asking for grief and was a bit of a cop out on the parents part.", "Good on you for not saying you'd split it between the kids. \n\nI think the parents probably didn't really think about it. Both kids had accounts and it probably seemed the right thing to do was to put it in the youngers account since it was something that is already established. \n\nAt some point the fact of the money is going to come out and the brother is going to feel left out no matter what and is going to demand a share. The money is rightfully the youngers money no matter when it was disclosed. THe brother is always going to feel it's unfair and feel left out."]}
