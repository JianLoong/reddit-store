We would get a certain amount for various tasks. We were told when we turned 16, the accounts would be used to buy cars. My brother always put any money he got from birthdays and holidays in as well. Two years ago, my brother turned 16 and got his car.\n\nMy sixteenth birthday was three days ago. I thought I would have less money than my brother, because I wasn't as good as he was about putting gift money in. But I had more, a lot more. My brother asked how on earth I had that much. My mom said the money came from our old neighbor. She used to live with her daughter, who is still our neighbor, but she died.\n\nI don't remember her very well, but I used to go over to their yard and sit and talk to her or read to her. I used to be really into fairies and magic as a little kid, and I made up stories about fairies that lived in the trees in our yard and the neighbor's yard. She was the only one that ever wanted to hear them, because, well, they were pretty silly and stupid stories. Apparently she left a little money for me when she died, and her daughter wrote a check to me and gave it my parents. They put it in my account.\n\nNeither my brother nor I could believe it. First of all, our neighbor died eight years ago, so that money has been sitting and collecting interest that whole time. There was no way my brother would ever have been able to keep up, no matter how many chores he did. He exploded about how unfair it was. Our parents said we needed to honor our neighbor's wish, so that was that.\n\nMy brother asked me to share with him, saying how unfair it was that I got more money than him for doing something I wanted to do and liked to do, when he did a lot of hard work, like mowing lawns, cleaning gutters and all. I said no, because he already has his car and doesn't need a new one. Besides, like our parents said, our neighbor wanted me to have the money. He called me a greedy B and said I don't deserve to have a nicer car than him, and he hopes I crash it.\n\nI do know that technically it's unfair, but she wanted me to have it.

Frankly your parents are the real AHs here for not dealing with this situation much better rather than just letting it come as a complete surprise to everyone.  Given you were only 8 or younger during the time you spent with the neighbour it really isn't the same as the money for chores and it's not 'earned' (although I'm not diminishing the impact you obviously had on your neighbour to have been moved to leave it to you - you obviously had a lovely relationship and you made her happy).  If I had been the parents I would have managed that money differently.  \n\nBut now, given its a complete windfall for you, it really would be kind to share it with your brother.  And YWBTA to say that you *can't* because you need to honour your neighbour's wishes - that's complete crap.
