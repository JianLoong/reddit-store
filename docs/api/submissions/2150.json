I used to be really into fairies and magic as a little kid, and I made up stories about fairies that lived in the trees in our yard and the neighbor's yard. She was the only one that ever wanted to hear them, because, well, they were pretty silly and stupid stories. Apparently she left a little money for me when she died, and her daughter wrote a check to me and gave it my parents. They put it in my account.\n\nNeither my brother nor I could believe it. First of all, our neighbor died eight years ago, so that money has been sitting and collecting interest that whole time. There was no way my brother would ever have been able to keep up, no matter how many chores he did. He exploded about how unfair it was. Our parents said we needed to honor our neighbor's wish, so that was that.\n\nMy brother asked me to share with him, saying how unfair it was that I got more money than him for doing something I wanted to do and liked to do, when he did a lot of hard work, like mowing lawns, cleaning gutters and all. I said no, because he already has his car and doesn't need a new one. Besides, like our parents said, our neighbor wanted me to have the money.

She clearly appreciated your company! For that alone you should keep every cent!", "NTA. Fairness or unfairness is completely irrelevant to this situation.

You were a friend to that old lady and she obviously valued your company. She wanted you to have that money. Your brother on the other hand did not have that relationship with her. His comments are just nasty. He should be proud of what he has achieved with his own car. But there's always someone else with better and part of being happy is accepting that fact. NTA.", ">I do know that technically it's unfair\n\nNo it isn't.\n\nSomeone gave you a gift, that doesn't mean they have to give the same gift to everybody else to keep it \"fair\".\n\nIt's not unfair at all.\n\nNTA.", "If your brother were to win the lottery tomorrow, do you think he\u2019d split it with you? I don\u2019t.\n\nAnd in this case, you spent time and energy enough with a lonely old lady that she felt she wanted to leave you something.\n\nYour brother worked and was responsible, but life isn\u2019t fair sometimes. He certainly doesn\u2019t have any claim to that money, even if it isn\u2019t fair that he has less.\n\nAnd now he\u2019s being an AH in his response to your good fortune. Selfishness, meanness, and pettiness are not characteristics of a good person. Hopefully he\u2019ll learn that and become a better one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou and your brother just learned a shitty reality of the world. You can work as hard as you want, but other people will come out ahead of you based on other factors, like who they connect with.\n\nHard work matters. He saved a lot of money up because of it. Don't take this as me saying you shouldn't work hard. But life isn't fair, and you will both experience times when you feel like you were more deserving of a reward that went to someone else.\n\nLearning how to be resilient against the unfair nature of the world is a big part of growing up.", "I disagree with you so much! It is extremely fair, and let me explain why: his doing work he hated was for him to \u201cearn the car\u201d and was completely him trading his time and effort directly for cash. You, on the other hand, made a genuine human connection with another, spent your time doing something that you loved that brought value and happiness to someone else\u2019s life, and, to top it off, you didn\u2019t do it to be paid or for a car, you did it because you cared. All of that is valuable and important and you got paid for bringing value to that woman\u2019s life. Honestly, one could argue that you gave greater value than your brother did with his work. His real argument is, he suffered more. He suffered with intent, that that suffering would ultimately be rewarded, and now he feels misled because you were rewarded for doing something beautiful and kind rather than just enduring suffering.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a great learning moment for all involved. There is supposed to be greater value and importance put on compassion and kindness then suffering. NTA, and I hope you enjoy your car, and your life lesson!", "Nta. The entitlement is strong in this one", "NTA NOT IN A MILLION YEARS", "NTA - although you didn't expect to get 'paid' by your neighbor, your neighbor appreciated your interest and you keeping her company.  Her intent was for you to have the money, not for you to split it with your brother.  \n\nYour brother should be happy for your good fortune and not be asking for you to share.  \n\nI've always said that if I ever came into a lot of money (won the lottery), I would share it but only with people who did not ask for some.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think it is unfair that you got this gift, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m calling it, because that\u2019s what it is a gift. For something selfless that you did, without even expecting anything in return. \n\nIt is completely deserved and you do not owe your brother anything, not even an explanation as to why you are keeping, what is rightfully given it to you. The only thing I want you to do is to remember this great deed that you did for someone who just needed it, and treasure that. Yes your brother worked hard by doing chores and jobs but something he\u2019s lacking; is compassion, and selfishness he could stand to learn a thing or two from you.", "NTA - You were a gift to your neighbor. This was her gift to YOU, not your brother.", "NTA\n\nThe jealous/greedy one here is the brother. Sometimes it\u2019s the \u201cchores\u201d that people see as a waste of time that are the ones that bring unexpected benefits. To OP it wasn\u2019t even a chore spending time talking to an old neighbor who very obviously enjoyed the interaction. OP\u2019s brother probably thought that was a waste of time. \n\nWhen he found out about the money he wasn\u2019t happy for OP he was just pissed off for himself and demanded money that he did nothing to deserve. The icing on the AH cake was the wishing that OP would crash the car. The brother is a raging AH spewing sriracha sauce. \n\nOP don\u2019t give your brother anything. After basically wishing very possible death and injury on you over this he deserves nothing.", ">He exploded about how unfair it was\n\nWhat a spoiled brat.\n\nYou got the money because of the deeds you did. Beside being good deeds and something you enjoyed - it turned out to be **very** good business.\n\nBeside, it is the wish of a deceased, which is to be respected almost every time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother asked me to share with him\n\nWhich he has every right to do. Like you have every right to deny that request - especially, when he use the argumentation that it \"isn't fair\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>how unfair it was that I got more money than him for doing something I wanted to do and liked to do, when he did a lot of hard work\n\nSo, if you end up getting a way better payed job in a few years, doing something you want to do and like to do, then you should also share with him, according to his logic?\n\nI bet, he would never do the same the other way if it was him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I do know that technically it's unfair\n\nNo it is not. You have earned those money, fair and square. Keep them. Invest them wisely to make a better life for you and those you love.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a similar situation as your neighbor did, then please do the right karma-thing and give to someone who is in the same situation as you were back then. It would be a beautiful thing to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... and NTA at all! \u2764", "NTA but your brother seems to be", "It is not \"technically unfair.\" You did someone a kindness with no thought of reward. That kindness was returned to you.  Your brother has just as much of a chance that some unknown kindness he does might one day come back to him unexpectedly. Life is funny like that.  \n\nI hope someone think s to Reminds your brother that what goes around tends to come around - You were kind and he has reacted to your good fortune with demands, name-calling and ill-wishing.  Does he really think he deserves something for that?", "NTA. It\u2019s shitty for your brother overall not your or his fault though", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s behavior is mean-spirited, jealous, and greedy. Not good attributes. He\u2019s got a lot of misery in his future if he believes he\u2019s OWED! \n\nStand your ground, he has no right to the money.", "NTA at all. I'm sure the time you spent with your neighbor was worth so much more to her than the money she left you. That was very sweet of her and she meant it for you. Your bro can be upset but he absolutely should not be demanding your money, or calling you names, or giving you a hard time about this. Tell your parents they need to get him to back off and behave.", "Yes, OP may have done it inadvertently, but she was providing a kind of service (and a kind one too) to the neighbor that was at least just as valuable as household chores.  Some \"work\" can be a joy.", "I don't know about that, her brother sounds like a whiney jerk i.e.: \"I hope you crash your car\". I wouldn't want to have that wretch around me if I was old, or young for that matter.", "THIS RIGHT HERE is an excellent point. Bro needs to learn that life isn't always fair.  NTA", "He's greedy and sexist, considering he called her a B.", "Same happened in my family! My mother, the youngest of a passel, wrote letters to her aunt abroad and kept it up for years until the aunt died she also got a remembrance in the will. It wasn't huge funds, but it made her feel loved back. Aunt died with no children, as she got married to her \"true love\" in her 50s - my mother used her as an example that folks are never too old for romance <3", "You said this so beautifully. There are so many elderly people who are forgotten about.", "You expressed so perfectly what OP meant to neighbor. This just warmed my heart!", "And don't forget what pleasure this woman took in setting aside some money for OP. When I did my will I had so much fun thinking about the people I wanted to send something to. As generous as it was for the woman to make the gift, there's generosity involved in accepting the gift and remembering the relationship that preceeded it.", "Also I really think it needs to be pointed out to the people saying she should spend money on him... By telling her he hopes she crashes her car, he's also wishing physical harm on her, and potentially death."]}
