Two years ago, my brother turned 16 and got his car.\n\nMy sixteenth birthday was three days ago. I thought I would have less money than my brother, because I wasn't as good as he was about putting gift money in. But I had more, a lot more. My brother asked how on earth I had that much. My mom said the money came from our old neighbor. She used to live with her daughter, who is still our neighbor, but she died.\n\nI don't remember her very well, but I used to go over to their yard and sit and talk to her or read to her. I used to be really into fairies and magic as a little kid, and I made up stories about fairies that lived in the trees in our yard and the neighbor's yard. She was the only one that ever wanted to hear them, because, well, they were pretty silly and stupid stories. Apparently she left a little money for me when she died, and her daughter wrote a check to me and gave it my parents. They put it in my account.\n\nNeither my brother nor I could believe it. First of all, our neighbor died eight years ago, so that money has been sitting and collecting interest that whole time. There was no way my brother would ever have been able to keep up, no matter how many chores he did. He exploded about how unfair it was. Our parents said we needed to honor our neighbor's wish, so that was that.\n\nMy brother asked me to share with him, saying how unfair it was that I got more money than him for doing something I wanted to do and liked to do, when he did a lot of hard work, like mowing lawns, cleaning gutters and all. I said no, because he already has his car and doesn't need a new one. Besides, like our parents said, our neighbor wanted me to have the money. He called me a greedy B and said I don't deserve to have a nicer car than him, and he hopes I crash it.\n\nI do know that technically it's unfair, but she wanted me to have it.

She clearly appreciated your company! For that alone you should keep every cent!", "NTA. Fairness or unfairness is completely irrelevant to this situation.

Reading to her, telling her stories she made up all by herself, about faeries in the garden, no less! My cheeks hurt from smiling just imagining it!

It's the secrecy/surprise that has made this difficult for everyone to navigate.  Obviously neither kid seemed to know the balance of their accounts until they turned 16.  That's a bit weird tbh - it's great to teach kids to save but a bit weird to do it without them seeing their savings grow and isn't really teaching them how to handle money.    OP hasn't said how much it is so I don't know exactly what I would have done.

Both kids had accounts and it probably seemed the right thing to do was to put it in the youngers account since it was something that is already established. \n\nAt some point the fact of the money is going to come out and the brother is going to feel left out no matter what and is going to demand a share. The money is rightfully the youngers money no matter when it was disclosed.
