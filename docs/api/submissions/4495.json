We have just started having a decent relationship over the past 6 years or so. A lot of her animosity lies with my wife (Jen) (52f) and her family. I married Jen when Sara was 9 and Sara has always complained that she felt left out and harbors a lot of resentment. \n\nSara has it in her head that Jen doesn\u2019t like her. Sara doesn\u2019t bother to get to know Jen, but to be fair, Jen doesn\u2019t speak to Sara. When Sara was younger, she\u2019d make up lies saying that Jen told her if she didn\u2019t finish her breakfast that she\u2019d get me to spank her. To this day, Sara still won\u2019t own up to this lie. Jen\u2019s oldest daughter, Meg, was addicted to drugs for some time and Sara would send her care packages and words of encouragement during her recovery and Jen thought that was nice. However, one day, Sara called me saying Meg was asking for a substantial amount of money for very specific items that Sara wouldn\u2019t know anything about. Jen thought Sara was just making up stories again to throw Meg under the bus but I felt like Sara was being honest.\n\nOver the years, building a relationship with Sara has been challenging. Jen and I are currently raising Meg\u2019s daughter (9f). She and Sara get along well, but Sara has a chip on her shoulder because Jen posts photos of me going to my granddaughters sporting events, we took her to Disney, people refer to me as her dad, etc. My granddaughter recently found out that Sara was my actual daughter because I felt she was old enough to know. Sara expressed that she feels hurt when people call my granddaughter my daughter but a lot of people don\u2019t know Sara is my biological daughter. \n\nTo the issue - I want Sara to come around more. She says she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in my house because there are no (and never have been) any photos of Sara (just Jen\u2019s daughters, their husbands and kids) and Jen has ornaments with our names on them but not Sara and her husband. She says it makes her feel like an outsider. Sara also doesn\u2019t share the same views as us and she is just overall very different than all of us. I told Sara she needs to stop being childish and get over it and if she wanted to be included, she shouldn\u2019t have moved away and it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t live near us. Sara told me she was still my daughter regardless of where she lives. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670795079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjaicc/aita_for_what_i_told_my_daughter_she_was_being/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If this path goes on you will lose your daughter forever. She stills love you for some reasons but it will not go better with time. If you dont pile on your ego and try to make her part of your family, you will lose a daughter (maybe grandchildren) and it will be too late and you will regret it I guarantee it.", "YTA and honestly I'm a bit taken aback at your total lack of responsibility and self awareness in all of this.

If I was Sara I would've gone no contact with you ages ago. What kind of dad doesn't actively try to make their daughter feel loved, included, and cherished?

We were never believed because we were children and Dad assumed that she was being truthful because she was an adult.  They've been divorced since I was 25 but I'm now 52 and have just over the past several years told my dad about how devious and awful his second wife was.  He has sincerely apologized and said he was blinded, but of course the hurt is still there, even at the age I'm at now.

We have just started having a decent relationship over the past 6 years or so. A lot of her animosity lies with my wife (Jen) (52f) and her family. I married Jen when Sara was 9 and Sara has always complained that she felt left out and harbors a lot of resentment. \n\nSara has it in her head that Jen doesn\u2019t like her. Sara doesn\u2019t bother to get to know Jen, but to be fair, Jen doesn\u2019t speak to Sara. When Sara was younger, she\u2019d make up lies saying that Jen told her if she didn\u2019t finish her breakfast that she\u2019d get me to spank her. To this day, Sara still won\u2019t own up to this lie. Jen\u2019s oldest daughter, Meg, was addicted to drugs for some time and Sara would send her care packages and words of encouragement during her recovery and Jen thought that was nice. However, one day, Sara called me saying Meg was asking for a substantial amount of money for very specific items that Sara wouldn\u2019t know anything about. Jen thought Sara was just making up stories again to throw Meg under the bus but I felt like Sara was being honest.\n\nOver the years, building a relationship with Sara has been challenging. Jen and I are currently raising Meg\u2019s daughter (9f). She and Sara get along well, but Sara has a chip on her shoulder because Jen posts photos of me going to my granddaughters sporting events, we took her to Disney, people refer to me as her dad, etc. My granddaughter recently found out that Sara was my actual daughter because I felt she was old enough to know. Sara expressed that she feels hurt when people call my granddaughter my daughter but a lot of people don\u2019t know Sara is my biological daughter. \n\nTo the issue - I want Sara to come around more. She says she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in my house because there are no (and never have been) any photos of Sara (just Jen\u2019s daughters, their husbands and kids) and Jen has ornaments with our names on them but not Sara and her husband. She says it makes her feel like an outsider. Sara also doesn\u2019t share the same views as us and she is just overall very different than all of us. I told Sara she needs to stop being childish and get over it and if she wanted to be included, she shouldn\u2019t have moved away and it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t live near us. Sara told me she was still my daughter regardless of where she lives. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Either figure out why she needed to lie or get the abusive wife out of her life.  \n\nYour wife doesn't like your child.  Is it really that hard to believe it would have created a toxic environment for your daughter?  Your wife doesn't like your daughter, is it really hard to believe that she would accuse her of lying to protect herself and her daughter?\n\nSara shouldn't have to grow up or be more mature.  YOU need to actually start acting like her parent. \n\nAs for her having different views then you, maybe stop being so judgmental and listen to her. Maybe you will learn something.  At very least you could learn to appreciate your daughters perspective", "Yta for so many reasons. \n\nYou started off, with strong notes of asshole, with your choice of word with resentment. Chikdren don't just magically resent their parents. You intentionally favoured your problematic step daughter's poor choices instead of focusing on the now decades worth of damage you've done by neglecting your daughter.\n\nAnd you want a relationship with her? Had my dad not listened to me when I told him, that he has caused me so much damage and grief up until I stood up to him trying to shut me down over something he had no idea about, I wouldnt be talking to him today. I went NC with him for a solid 5 years to see if life was better without him in it before this happened.\n\nIt was multitudes better.\n\nYta and it's honestly so painful, as a child of divorce, to see that it's taken you to have grandchildren to even **consider** you *might* be an asshole.\n\nSurprise. YTA, have I said that yet?", "YTA. You allowed an adult to push you to alienate your kid. Of course she feels like an outsider, and you further perpetuated her being an outsider by not having a shred of her existence in your home despite her being YOUR KID. \n\nEven if she did lie as a kid, how does an adult hold a grudge against a nine year old until she\u2019s in her thirties? AH behavior all around.", "YTA. Reading this tells me that you consistently choose your wife and her children over Sara her whole life and you are still doing it. You let your wife ostracize your child from your family. \n\nYou can claim Jen does the decorating all you want but a real father would want a picture of their child in their home. A real father would tell his friends/family that he had a child, you don\u2019t just leave something like that out. \n\nWhy would Sara want to live near you or your wife? So she can once again be reminded she\u2019s not part of your family and never will be? \n\nYou need grow up and start acting like the adult and stop putting all the blame on your daughter when you are the one that failed her.", "I'm baffled by your view on this whole situation. \n\nYTA. How do people not know you have a daughter?????? But you think your daughter is childish for feeling excluded? Honestly, do you hear yourself??? Please reread what you wrote and actually think about it without getting defensive. Think about how maybe your daughter wasn't lying in the first place.", "I don't understand, she is your daughter, why don't you go visit her?   Why must she make all the effort?   Why must she spend money to go to a house clearly where she isn't welcome?  How much more cruel can you be?  Your wife doesn't speak to your daughter at all, is very much a hostile environment.  \n\n   Seek therapy & your daughter's forgiveness.", "YTA for choosing your wife and do-over family over your only daughter.", "YTA\nit sounds like you've continued to allow your wife to mistreat your daughter, and then wonder why she doesn't come around?", "YTA, how can you write this and now see how you've failed your daughter??", "YTA. But I also would love for you to try to explain how you know for certain that your daughter was lying. Please. Because most kids wouldn\u2019t lie about stuff like that if they haven\u2019t had a history of it prior.\n\nAlso you say your wife doesn\u2019t hate her, yet..she 100% acts like she hates her?? You don\u2019t tell anyone you have a daughter. You didn\u2019t even tell your GRANDCHILD you have a daughter. Like how dense are you?? No wonder your bio kid comes around. You\u2019ve spent her whole life acting like she didn\u2019t exist and was just a lying, useless child.", "You: I don\u2019t care about you and you aren\u2019t part of my family enough. People don\u2019t even know you\u2019re my child. \nSara: I don\u2019t feel like family and you make me feel like an outsider.\nYou: Stop being childish!\n\nYTA. You\u2019ve been the asshole for Sara\u2019s whole life. How can you be so blind?", "I don't comment a lot, but this is different. I have read all of your comments, and, from the bottom of my heart, YTA.\n\nYou chose your new wife over Sara. You knew that her mother was abusive, therefore her actions/feelings were being influenced by that abuse. You knew that and you *still chose* to believe Jen when Sara acted up. Acting up is something normal for teens/children, and if they are being abused (as you knew she was!) this growing phase of life is even worse, and you did not care about her. You chose Jen over and over and over, and Sara obviously grew distant from you and bonded with her ex-stepfather, who was probably the only person who ever took care of her right.\n\nNow, onto what you say on one of your comments - you *never went* to one of her tourneys? Or any kind show? From someone whose parents didn't show up for some of my violin auditions, I can tell you that this hurts, and *a lot.* I can even say that I am 100% sure that she resents you for this, as well as for not having photos of her up. And Gods, saying that you 'don't have photos because she lives far away' is one of the worst excuses I have ever heard. You simply *do not care.*\n\nGrow up and be a better father while you still can. I suspect that Sara will go NC with you if you keep up like this.\n\nYTA.", "Better title:\n\n\"I treated my daughter like an outsider and now I don't know why she feels like an outsider, boo hoo I'm an awful parent. Boo hoo someone feel bad for me\"\n\nIn case it isn't clear, YTA", "Wow. YTA. Gross", "YTA. If I was Sara I would have cut you off. Your full of bad energy and other words I can\u2019t say without getting banned. You failed her as a father", "YTA \nSara is right. You do seem to be guilty of everything she is accusing you of. \n\nYou are hiding her from your grandchildren. Don\u2019t use not \u201cconfusing\u201d them as an excuse. Children are more competent than that.\n\nYou have no pictures of her in your house? None? No wonder she feels sad, left out, and rejected.\n\nYou continually chose to believe her stepmother over her as a child. You put Jen and her family before Sara. That was the choice you made, and now you pay the consequences.\n\nThis will be a good post to point people to to say \u201cthis is your future if you don\u2019t shape up\u201d.", "I'm going to be blunt. You were thinking with your dick instead of your heart. You let her turn you against your daughter instead of packing her off and keeping your daughter.\n\nEverything you have said doesn't help your case. No photos of your own daughter in your own house? Nothing with her name on? Not taking her to places?\n\nYTA and god I would love to meet you in person.", "YTA. Some people don't deserve to be a father.", "YTA. She is your biological and no one knows. Why did you have to wait for your granddaughter to be old enough for you to tell her that your daughter is your daughter?  You have no pictures of your daughter or her family in your house ever. Your wife refuses to speak to her. But she is the one being difficult? \n\nShe doesn't exist in your house and you barely acknowledge her existence. So congrats on allowing your wife push her out of the family. Honestly I am surprised she still speaks to you.", "YTA.\n\n You have pictures of your step kids and their families up but none of your daughter?!

YTA\n\nAnd that's just the beginning.....", "Y are absolutely TA\n\nMy ex screwed up his relationship with our daughter in a very similar way, and it took ages to get them back to a good relationship. She will probably never fully trust him again though even if they are back to being fairly close.\n\nYou've done pretty much everything you could to alienate her, but SHE'S being childish?You're the parent, you have the primary responsibility in keeping your relationship good, you failed at that years ago why exactly is she supposed to trust you now?", "Reading your post, its all about you and Jen and her kids and whatever on her side. You have left your own daughter out since she was 9. Not believing what she said and thoroughly claiming them as lies. Never once you did try to investigate. How cruel you and Jen can be.\n\nJen seemed an awful and a wicked step mother. She lied to you. Not even a picture of her in your home is a very telling sign of how you conduct your family. That is, Sara was never and is still not wanted nor included.\n\nI hope Sara goes NC with your the rest of her life. After all everything she says to you, you take it as lies. Crap father you are.\n\nBig YTA", "I really hope Meg or her daughter have the room for  when both you and Jen are older otherwise, guess who's going to the damn retirement home.\n\nYou've erased your daughter from your life and are wondering now why she doesn't want to spend time with you? You absolute drop-kick \n\nYTA", "YTA. This is 100% your fault. You made Sara feel like she was less than nothing. You're her father and you failed her repeatedly.

Why shouldn't she? Why don't you read over the words that you wrote above?\n\nIt does not matter where your child lives. She could live right next door to you or 5,000 miles away. \n\nShe will always be your child. \n\nRepeat that.\n\nMaybe you might start with putting some ornaments on the tree like the others in your family, hanging her pictures around the house with her family included, and start treating her as if she is part of your family.\n\nMake her presence known so that everybody who comes to your house knows that she is your child and very much loved and needed in your family dynamic.\n\nShe is and will always be your child.\n\nYou need to explain this to your wife. \n\nIf all she does is complain about your daughter and continuously tries to keep you separate? Then that should give you a hint where she stands in regards to any type of relationship you want to have with your daughter. \n\nShe does not approve. She will never approve.\n\nAnd why do you believe every single thing your wife says about your biological child? \n\nDid you ever try to see your child's perspective? She is an adult with choldren now. If you have questions about things that happened in the past? Why don't you speak to your daughter?\n\nYour current wife seems to not want to say or do anything to help the relationship you have with your child.\n\nThis means she wants the status quo to remain as it is.
