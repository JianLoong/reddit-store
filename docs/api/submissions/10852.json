I never really cared either way but she mentioned moving forward in our relationship multiple times so I obliged. \n\nAt first things were ok as we were getting used to it then I noticed our condoms would break. A lot. At first I thought it was me so I did my part researching brands and proper usage and such but they kept breaking. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it until I realized it happened way too often. I could see if it was once in a while but it started happening like 3-4 times a month. \n\nLast week Gia was over and she initiated some fun time but excused herself to the bathroom first. I didn\u2019t notice she went into the downstairs one and walked in on her holding some condoms and the part of one of her earrings with the needle on it (the part that sticks in the ear). \n\nI didn\u2019t see her actually poking them but that paired with Gia being raised by a single mom that had her young (idr what age but I know it was young) and her always commenting on babies we see in public or bringing up baby names randomly when we talk (I thought that was just a girl thing tbh) I put 2 and 2 together. We started arguing and I told her to get out and I needed time and space to think. \n\nI\u2019ve been kinda avoiding her but I care about her so I didn\u2019t wanna just break up. But when I saw her at school the other day she started whining in class about how I\u2019m being unfair giving her the cold shoulder I just got angry and I shouted\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re some baby obsessed psycho\u201d in front of everyone. \n\nGia stopped talking and teared up and walked out of class and didn\u2019t come back. One of her friends saw me later in the day and said I really embarrassed her and people are gossiping. \n\nI do feel bad for yelling and maybe I should have waited to have the conversation in private but I was so mad.

Anyway, massive red flag. You can't trust her and you have different life goals.", "The Y T A and E S H comments are really surprising. She's trying to baby-trap him. How is it at all acceptable? What if the genders were reversed and it was a man exposing his gf to an unwanted pregnancy and STDs by stealthing? Would you be insisting on his right to privacy? OP *could* have chosen to resolve this differently but he's very much NTA.", "NTA\n\n\nWhile probably not the best choice of words, you\u2019re young and make mistakes what she did was messed up and you had a normal response in the heat of the moment. It sucks that there\u2019s gossip, but she brought it up first in a public setting probably in hopes to manipulate you (she may not even realize that). That\u2019s also assault. Use your own condoms from now on. But I don\u2019t recommend having any sort of romantic relationship with her. It\u2019s so messed up to try and baby trap someone, especially a teenager. Maybe you should tell a teacher you\u2019re concerned about her, or next year you\u2019ll be testifying for a fellow classmate in family court over child support.", "NTA - she has been abusing you. Reproductive coercion is abuse. It is abuse.\n\nPlease dump her. It is better to be alone than with someone who abuses you. You deserve to be treated with care and consideration. Not have someone assault you and try to force you to father a child you don\u2019t want.", "Yeah\u2026you need to break up with her. This is really bad.", "NTA-She brought it into public first. Your choice of words may have been less than tactful but you weren\u2019t incorrect.", "NTA \n\nHonestly I would be letting your parents, her parents and maybe the police know. \n\nGetting someone pregnant by slipping off a condom during sex is considered sexual assault. \n\nActually the slipping off the condom without consent during sex is considered assault. \n\nI\u2019m sure that police would think poking holes in condoms is assault also.", "NTA you\u2019re totally right. Run away, she is not to be trusted.", "NTA. Get out, *now*.", "NTA. That's sexual assault.", "NTA\n\nBreak up. Now. *Do not have sex with her again*. She's trying to baby trap you and my dude, you don't want that. Not at 18. I promise you there will be other women to sleep with who don't sabotage your birth control--which is *fucking psycho* shit. And I say this as an adult who is currently pregnant by choice. If anyone messes with birth control or tries to make a pregnancy happen against the other person's wishes, that's fucking nuts and that's not someone you should continue to have sex with, period.", "Wow, that's messed up. You're highschoolers. What's she's doing is in the area of sexual assault. I'm not sure if the term for this is stealthing exactly, but it's the same thing.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIf she's actually doing that, it's a form of r@pe. It's literal sexual assault. \n\nAll these people \"oh you shouldn't do that in public\". Why not? She's SA'd OP. She should be called out for it and in public too so she stops.

If a guy was pulling off the condom mid sex and not telling his girlfriend, and she called him out on it in public. Would you still feel like she should\u2019ve talked to him in private?", "NTA- Why is nobody talking about the fact that every time she poked holes in condoms (that we think she did) isn\u2019t consensual. It\u2019s not at all consensual. Also she started the conversation in public. Raising your voice wasn\u2019t the right thing to do at the time, but I can understand the difficulty of someone risking your future, and not being truthful enough to where you could properly give consent.", "NTA but my dude\u2026 Run. \n\nShe Will find a way to trap you if you don\u2019t keep your willy far far away from her.", "NTA. OMG she is really behaving like a psycho. she needs help not a baby. please stay away from her.", "NTA. Let it be a warning for other guys.", "If what you suspect her of is true, NTA. But what you said is kind of dumb. \n\nIf she\u2019s legit trying to have a baby without your consent, that\u2019s a fucked up, life-changing action. \n\nHowever, you could have probably said something better, like \u201cyou poked holes in our condoms to try to get yourself pregnant.\u201d What you said makes it seem like you are just mad that she wants to be pregnant, which probably makes you *look* like an AH to anyone without all the deets.", "NTA. Whining about being unfair? she's actively trying to make you a father without your consent. Shit is borderline rape, when a man or a woman does it.", "NTA\nWhat she did was terrible. I don\u2018t think you have to feel sorry for what you said and that people heard it. She came to you in public to blame you. It\u2019s all on her, honestly", "You say you care about her so you don\u2019t want to break up. Are you prepared to have a baby with this woman? If not, exit the relationship, and soon, before she falls pregnant. \n\nNTA. She sexually assaulted you. Your reaction at school wasn\u2019t ideal, but I can absolutely understand your anger.", "Sure you could have handled it better and not said that in public but you need to run while you can, what she did is literally sexual assault and if you stay if this relationship it will just be the start of the ways she will manipulate you", "NTA Ignore anyone saying your response to sexual assault was inappropriate.  That's misandry talking.  They would NEVER say that to a female.  Why would any victim consider the feelings of their assailant?\nStay far away from her, unless you want to pay child support for 18 years.  She is a very dishonest, manipulative person.  Do not allow yourself to be alone with her again. Next come the false accusations to completely ruin your life.  \nGood luck, and stay strong. I'm proud of you for speaking up for yourself.", "NTA.

That girl wants her fingers in your financials via child support for the next 18 years.  Flee!", "NTA\n\nCould it have been better to not yell in public? Sure.\n\nBut she lost any ounce of respect the moment she began to tamper with your condoms. I usually don\u2019t advocate for splitting on these posts, but this is one of those situations.\n\nAnytime you use a condom, you now have to think, \u201cdid she tamper with it?\u201d Or only use condoms that are in your sight 24/7, but you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship that requires that much worry", "NTA. Break up and get as far away from her as you can. Gia is a psycho. This is serious criminal behaviour.", "Nta what she is doing is called stealthing and it is absolutely not ok.", "Dude, at this point she is going to have a baby, with you or w/o you. What she did was so malicous, i'm pretty sure nothing is gonna stop her from having this baby. If you aren't willing to knock her up, someone else will be. \n\nStaying with her and not have a baby is not an option anymore. So you need to decide if you want to be a dad in about 9-12 months or not. But keep in mind how far your gf is willing to go to get what she wants. If this was me i would stay far far away from her. A child is a lifelong comittment (and a very expensive one) and someone who is willing to make this decision against their partners will is very selfish.", "NTA. Run. Fast.", "NTA.\nY\u2019all, stop calling this girl psycho. She\u2019s not psychotic. Psychotic people are people having delusions and such. She clearly knew what she was doing. She made her decision for months. She\u2019s got issues, but don\u2019t blame it on psychosis. Blame it on manipulation and some type of personality disorder.", "Nta", "You can't trust her.

She is not a stable partner.", "NTA.... Sweet summer child, I feel for you, men aren't educated about what sexual assault/abuse is. Unfortunately, you will likely run into similar situations for the next decade or so. The best thing you can do to protect yourself is a vasectomy. The second best thing you can do is buy and apply your own condoms. Yes vasectomies are expensive, but not as expensive as a child or therapy for PTSD from an abusive partner.", "ESH.  You should not have done that in public.  But holy shit, what she did was a kind of sexual assault.
