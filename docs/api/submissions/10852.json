A lot. At first I thought it was me so I did my part researching brands and proper usage and such but they kept breaking. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it until I realized it happened way too often. I could see if it was once in a while but it started happening like 3-4 times a month. \n\nLast week Gia was over and she initiated some fun time but excused herself to the bathroom first. I didn\u2019t notice she went into the downstairs one and walked in on her holding some condoms and the part of one of her earrings with the needle on it (the part that sticks in the ear). \n\nI didn\u2019t see her actually poking them but that paired with Gia being raised by a single mom that had her young (idr what age but I know it was young) and her always commenting on babies we see in public or bringing up baby names randomly when we talk (I thought that was just a girl thing tbh) I put 2 and 2 together. We started arguing and I told her to get out and I needed time and space to think. \n\nI\u2019ve been kinda avoiding her but I care about her so I didn\u2019t wanna just break up. But when I saw her at school the other day she started whining in class about how I\u2019m being unfair giving her the cold shoulder I just got angry and I shouted\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re some baby obsessed psycho\u201d in front of everyone. \n\nGia stopped talking and teared up and walked out of class and didn\u2019t come back. One of her friends saw me later in the day and said I really embarrassed her and people are gossiping. \n\nI do feel bad for yelling and maybe I should have waited to have the conversation in private but I was so mad.
