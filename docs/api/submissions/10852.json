Maybe when you're with a woman you want to spend life with, and you agree you don't want any more children. And even then I heard there can be complications and pain, though I never researched that so maybe I'm wrong. In any way it's not worth losing the chance of having a family later just for the 18yo psycho.\n\nI would steer clear of her though, also I would be very wary of getting drunk and/or drugged with her anywhere around you, there's a non-zero chance she'll try to get advantage of you when you're not at your senses. My wife's friend had this happened to him by their fellow student.", ">What you said makes it seem like you are just mad that she wants to be pregnant, which probably makes you _look_ like an AH to anyone without all the deets.\n\nThey're in high school. I doubt that being mad at his girlfriend for wanting to make him a father would make him look like an AH.", "Laws are catching up to men who slip off condoms to charge them with sexual assault. \n\nSurely laws are catching up to women (well school\nChildren in this case) who attempt to baby trap someone by poking holes in condoms", "you never get anything unless you ask for it. if you go to the cops, maybe they'll do something maybe they wont\n\nif you dont go to the cops, they definitely wont\n\nwhy would you not?", "Having a police report on file might be handy in a child support case.", "It's also a form of sexual assault.

So in the UK a woman could just rape someone and it wouldnt be considered rape?", "Dude. She tried to baby trap you. \n\nThe relationship is past repair. Trust me, cuz you can't trust her anymore. If you stay with her, can you trust that she won't do this ever again? No.", "my guy. run. run fast. run far. run like forest. fucking. RUN.", "It's reproductive coercion. And if you care about her at all, tell everyone who is close to her. Her parents, her best friends. She needs help and the only thing you can do is notify the actual people who can help her. Do not sleep with her again unless you're ok with being a father. Honestly you shouldn't really be sleeping with anyone just using condoms as your only form of BC imo it's still very risky even when used correctly. There's additional things like spermicide foam/gel that can be used in addition to condoms so you're not relying on the woman to use potentially invasive or hormonal BC methods.", "If this OP's girlfriend were posting this story I wager she would frame it that the condom broke; she would deliberately leave out the part where she helped it break.

If a transgender woman with a penis rapes someone this law still applies.\"\n\nThere's a whole Wikipedia page about it.

Also true of some other countries like India.", "A lot of places look at it like that sadly.", "Yep, LGBT groups have been arguing that the law needs to change for years but nothing happens.", "I loved the response. \"It's not clear what you want us to do about this.\" LIKE FOOKIN CHANGE IT LAD, DID YA FAIL YER GCSE", "Jesus on a pogo stick, what the actual donkey????!!!", "This is just definitions,  rape is with a penis. Sexual assault is anything else. What the previous commenters didn\u2019t mention is that they have degrees of SA and nonconsensual penetration with an object is very high up there.

But it\u2019s not like they are being treated the same as a dude who grabbed a butt \nthat didn\u2019t belong to him.\n\nEdit thinking about it I don\u2019t know what the difference in punishment is exactly it is possible that those types of SA might not carry as severe of punishments as I believe  but I am unsure of the specifics.", "Have you tested her for autism?
