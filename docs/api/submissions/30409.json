If the kerbside area isn't available, the fire trucks just stop in the street blocking traffic, or on the front lawn, or wherever they can.\n\nI'm not saying fire lanes are a bad idea, and neither is towing people who park in them.   OP is certainly NTA.   But I just thought the comment was a bit over-dramatic.\n\nHave you seen the photo of the firefighters who broke the windows of the car parked in front of the fire hydrant, in order to run their hose through?

I wasn't even paying attention to that part. Good point.", "The tow company wouldn't know who called the police. She's probably just assuming you did it. If they keep bothering you, call the police again to report their harassment.", "NTA.  What if a cop just happened to drive by and notice her parking, same result.  You just made it happen faster.  They can be as mad as they want, but they were in the wrong.", "I agree with this, however I was just commenting on the dramatic wording in the original comment (\"potential consequences ...  are just too horrible to tolerate\").", "eh, i can kinda see their point. people who park in fire lanes/in front of fire hydrants are almost always repeat offenders. having their car seized and destroyed (after multiple offenses, not just a one time happening) would be a very expensive lesson to deter it from happening in the future.", "NTA but also... The way you've worded your post sounds like the whole egg was just sitting there unbroken in your yard.\n\nIs that right?

Letting her make everyone ELSE's life difficult because her life is difficult is saying she is more important than everyone else. She is not. Nor is anyone else more important than she is. Her following the rules of \"no blocking a fire lane\" are there for everyone else's safety. If you felt comfortable, you could have said something. if not, you and all your neighbors should have been calling the parking enforcement on them immediately. \n\nShe and her bf are mad because they've done it for so long, they feel entitled. You gotta stop this stuff before it makes this kind of situation\n\nYou are NTA, you will rarely be NTA if you think of not just \"it makes my life difficult but I'm used to letting people do that\" but also \"this person is making everyone else's life more difficult, so I am speaking up for them, not just me.\"", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t a can you move over thing.

Good, they may have thrown the book at her", "NTA Aside from blocking the alley with the trash dumpster, she is consistently using a FIRE LANE as her own personal parking space.
