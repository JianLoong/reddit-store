If the kerbside area isn't available, the fire trucks just stop in the street blocking traffic, or on the front lawn, or wherever they can.\n\nI'm not saying fire lanes are a bad idea, and neither is towing people who park in them.   OP is certainly NTA.   But I just thought the comment was a bit over-dramatic.\n\nHave you seen the photo of the firefighters who broke the windows of the car parked in front of the fire hydrant, in order to run their hose through?   The firefighters give no fucks and will figure out a way to do their job.", "\"All\" she was doing was parking in a ***FIRE LANE.***", "I here by grant you the courage to get them towed. \n\nOnward and forth!", "My guess is she sees me struggling to maneuver to get in my garage.

All you\u2019re doing is setting yourself up for frustration.", "I have that", "Having fire lands in your country or not, the fire fighters shouldn\u2019t have to find a way around obstacles (in this case a person\u2019s car) when there are designated spots for them to do their job in the event of an emergency. the time wasted having to bust windows open to feed the hose through a car to get to the pump could be the difference between life and death if someone was trapped in a burning building. \n\nAs someone that has lived in nyc with a car, parking can be a bitch and ive occasionally went nearly 30 minutes trying to find parking that wasn\u2019t in a tow away zone or blocking a fire hydrant. not being able to find a spot close to home doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to a fire zone.", "my dead end street only allows parking on one side bc it's too narrow for emergency vehicles to get in if people park on both sides. the year I bought my house, everyone was lazy about parking on both sides of the street, due to there being a lot of duplexes and houses with separately rented back houses, and not enough driveway parking... a house burned to the ground and nearly burned the entire block bc the fire truck couldn't get through. yes, they ripped out/towed the cars parked illegally, but in the time it took to do that, the house burned down and neighboring houses were singed. parking in a fire lane is a terrible idea.", "Oh man. I wasn't even paying attention to that part. Good point.", "The tow company wouldn't know who called the police. She's probably just assuming you did it. If they keep bothering you, call the police again to report their harassment.", "NTA.  What if a cop just happened to drive by and notice her parking, same result.  You just made it happen faster.  They can be as mad as they want, but they were in the wrong.", "I agree with this, however I was just commenting on the dramatic wording in the original comment (\"potential consequences ...  are just too horrible to tolerate\").", "eh, i can kinda see their point. people who park in fire lanes/in front of fire hydrants are almost always repeat offenders. having their car seized and destroyed (after multiple offenses, not just a one time happening) would be a very expensive lesson to deter it from happening in the future."]}
