If he goes a whole week- Monday through Friday- without a note home from his teacher in his folder, I would take him to McDonalds and get him a happy meal or to Dairy Queen for a blizzard. He has cashed in on this twice this past school year. \n\nThe first week of school this year kinda sucked. He got two notes in one week and I reminded him of our deal this past weekend. He texted me every day from his mama\u2019s phone that he had no notes Monday through Thursday. His mother asked me to pick him up from school (I am an approved grown up on the pickup list). I figured he would have had a good day today as well, so when I picked him up I asked if he wanted to go to DQ or McDonalds? \n\nHe starts sobbing in the backseat saying he got a note 5 minutes before the final bell. My heart broke and I pulled over, and helped him calm down. I told him it didn\u2019t count. He was confused. I told him again that it didn\u2019t count and asked him again where he wanted to go. He said McDonalds and I drove us there, got him a happy meal, and I took him home. \n\nHe was happy and his mom was happy too when she saw the treat. Cut to about 15 minutes after I dropped him off, and his mom calls me on the phone. She starts cussing me out about her son not learning the consequences of his actions and that she threw out his happy meal and that he is grounded for lying to me. \n\nI argued back that he got the note 5 minutes before the final bell and that the day was basically over, so it didn\u2019t count. I told her he didn\u2019t lie to me- he told me right when he got in the car. He worked hard the whole week for his happy meal, so I got him one. I told her that she was being a ridiculous, irrational witch for throwing his food away. \n\nShe called me an idiot and said that I was going to be taken off the approved pickup list if I ever did that again. \n\nLittle dude called me about 10 minutes later to apologize to me for fibbing. I told him he didn\u2019t fib to me and that we will move treat day to Saturdays to make sure there were no notes. I told him he did a good job this week and that he would do a good job this next week. \n\nSo, AITA for buying a kid a happy meal?", "created_utc": 1694215375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dpps7/aita_for_buying_a_kid_a_happy_meal/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are trying the same thing but with a softer hand. Ultimately, this one is mom\u2019s call. If he doesn\u2019t hit the milestone required for a happy meal, he can\u2019t have one. \n\nIf you ever plan to deviate from the normal agreement again, frame it as a reward for something else he\u2019s done. This instance, you could have said he was honest with you and showed remorse so he earned a little treat for honesty. Maybe, instead of a full Happy Meal he could have an ice cream cone or a small French fry. Then you\u2019re rewarding good behavior but not dropping the rules for the real prize and teaching him he can\u2019t pull heartstrings and still get a prize.

I'd have gotten cussed out too. \nGood part on you for moving days as to not get the weekly (potential) treat taken away.", "NTA.  As the mom of a (now adult) kiddo like that, I can tell you that they don't have enough people in their lives telling them that they are \"good\" and treating them like a regular kid.

But it does undermine the incentive process for a ADHD child to get the incentive even when they did not meet the goal, regardless of how close they were. As it was explained to us by our child\u2019s psychologist, children with ADHD will remember the time they got what they wanted without following the rules and therefore keep thinking they can get it again without following the rules. It can take months for him to relearn.\n\nI\u2019ll also note our psychologist made clear many times that, at this age, incentive rewards need to be as immediate as possible.

And did you know what he did before saying it was null? I think if it was something very minor like talking to someone about getting McDonalds after school then yeah NTA, but if he did something legit like hit a kid then I would say you were the asshole.", "NTA, people who throw out good food are almost always the assholes, while she may not want to be as lenient as you, there were surely less abusive ways of handling the situation.", "NTA. I would understand if it was a little earlier in the day, but five minutes before dismissal? That kid was probably just excited to leave the prison that is school sometimes. You did the right thing that mother is overreacting. That kid worked hard for that.", "NTA. Him knowing that you are by his side to offer him encouragement to do better AND to forgive him when he messes up and confesses is priceless.

Any classroom management issues you have at the beginning of the year will only get worse, so teachers will try to let families know right away if there's something a kid needs to work on. I had some students last year that I probably should have called home about early on, but instead I just kept giving them reminders, and they quickly realized those reminders weren't backed up by any consequence and stopped taking them seriously. And the result was a really hard-to-teach class and kids who didn't learn as much as they should have.", "No, I'm sure the kid is fine. But I was a bad kid once too.

Yeah, you did nothing wrong.", "that teacher shouldn\u2019t be teaching.", "Because they let his mom know he needs to work on lining up with the other kids? What's wrong with that? The teacher is just doing their job of teaching classroom safety routines and communicating with parents when kids are struggling with them. Putting a note in a folder is not abuse."]}
