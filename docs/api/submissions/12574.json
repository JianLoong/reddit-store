If she badgers you into watching the dogs just don't treat it like a serious commitment. The day before, tell her \"oh, I got my schedule wrong, I'm actually out of town for the next week, sorry!\".", "This is where you trying to be nice and not saying no outright has backfired unfortunately. Frankly, framing it to her in terms of your two different styles of planning isn\u2019t helping you. She thinks you want to watch her dogs, and it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t commit.", "She regularly uses language like this. \"My calendar is already full. Next time you want to do something you need to book with me in advance\"", "Agreed - I understand why she needs to plan in advance, but she doesn't first approach kennel or pet sitting services. It's always me first, and then the guilt trip begins with how expensive the other option is, how her dog isn't good with other dogs...", "You need to stop being friends with this person. You\u2019re like me. I\u2019m a people pleaser and someone who truly loves my friends. I had friends like this who always took advantage of my desire to please them. She doesn\u2019t care about you or she wouldn\u2019t treat you like this.", "> she'll never take no for an answer and she'll try to negotiate to turn my \"no\" into a \"yes\" and she'll basically try to guilt trip me\n\nSo end the conversation. \u201cI said no and it\u2019s not up for negotiation\u201d. Don\u2019t JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain).", "Please do. Apart from being under her beck and call, you can be free to live your life your way!", "Agreed. I think I just want to be there for people and support them, but i want to do it on my terms. In this case, me saying no because I might have something else going on at that time has her saying things along the lines of \"you don't have anything going on, and you're not a good friend because you won't do me this favor\"\n\nAnd go be clear, when I commit I never back out", "If she can't afford to pay fair market rate for a kennel or a petsitter in her home or theirs, *she can't afford the vacation she's planning*.\n\nHer wanting to cut an expense isn't your problem or your responsibility. You didn't have any part of getting two dogs. They aren't your problem.\n\n I'm going to tweak a favorite phrase and remind you \"not your circus, not your puppies\".", "Obviously you should be thrilled to have the opportunity for the excitement of dogs in your very obviously not-much-going-on life. Because there is no way that come September, you\u2019ll have anything better to do :)", "Is your mush team at the mechanics or something?", "Exactly this! She could always take a one week trip and use the money save from her second planned week to pay for the kennel.", ">that leaves her plenty of time to find a kennel for her dog and save up the money to pay for it!\n\nAmen!!!!!", "I think the person to whom you're replying is talking more about \"What's it like to raise children?\" and less, you know, \"How is babby formed?\""]}
