There is nothing wrong with the friend\u2019s urge to nail down arrangements well in advance. I am also a planner. One of my current projects is planning a big family vacation for spring 2024. There is nothing wrong with the friend preferring a dog sitter to a kennel, as I understand dogs can get sick in kennels. There is nothing wrong with the friend asking OP if they\u2019d be willing to dog sit months in advance.\n\nHowever, there is also nothing wrong with OP not wanting to commit to something many months in advance, especially to a favor that might end up being something they regret promising. The OP could even be happy to dog sit if it\u2019s convenient, but just doesn\u2019t know now.\n\nBut this from the friend is obnoxious, manipulative and presumptuous.\n\n>She said, \"seems like you don't have much going on, so it sounds like you have the capacity to take this on\"\n\nIt fails to respect the OP\u2019s preference for spontaneity and lack of interest in committing this far ahead. It also assumes the friend is entitled to the OP\u2019s time, that the only acceptable reason for the OP saying no is that she has a prior commitment. I have met people who do this sort of thing in attempting to get someone to do a favor. They know exactly what they\u2019re doing.\n\nIf the friend wants a dog sitter booked months in advance, there are presumably professional dog sitters who would be happy to book a job for September.   \n\n\nOP, this would be a perfectly reasonable response to a reasonable and considerate person.\n\n>She recently reached out saying that she'd like me to dogsit for 2 weeks September, and I told her I don't know what i have going on at that time and don't want to commit as yet, and that I can tell her closer to the date, but in the meantime she should seek alternatives for dogsitting. \n\nBut that\u2019s not who you\u2019re dealing with.

Instead of \"I'm busy the second night, can't do it\" being my out, she went \"Oh great! You can do this night, and other friend who is busy that night is only available the next! That works out!\". She asked me months in advance to look after her pet another time. I told her it was too far ahead for me to know, and instead of asking someone else in the meantime as I had suggested, she waited to ask me closer to the date. But in between then my dad got really sick, went on hospice, and died. She still asked me again like a month or two after he passed. I wasn't mentally feeling well at all, and not up for doing favors for someone who was kind of insensitive during my difficult time. I was kind of flabbergasted that she still asked.  So instead of leaving an opening this time, I said \"Sorry, that doesn't work for me. Good luck!\". I've found with people like that, you can't give them space to squeeze in.
