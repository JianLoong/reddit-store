I love dogs, but I'm not willing to take them on for myself right now because I don't want to be tied down. I've even mentioned this and she still doesn't get it. She honestly doesn't see what the big deal is.", "Ikr", "I'm learning \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0", "This is \ud83d\udcaf how she operates", "\ud83d\ude4f", "No is a complete sentence <-- this is part of my DNA now", "\ud83d\ude4f", " \ud83d\ude4f", "Bless \ud83d\ude4f", "Amen", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Saving that as my response if I'm in a nice mood next time she brings this up ;)", "Oh damn... yes the language is similar and doesn't feel appropriate for family and friends! Hoping your boundaries don't feel disrespected :)", "I think this thread has really put this into perspective. She has badgered me long enough:/", "Mental is a good description!\ud83e\udd23", "Agreed. Just need to be firm in the future and not leave any openings. I don't need to be put down because I get to be flexible with my schedule. In her mind it's \"I'm asking for 14 days, you have over 351 days to do with what you want, why can't you give me these 14.\" Sigh.", "Nothing wrong with planning ahead at all! I make travel plans in advance as well, but nowhere in that process do i hijack people's schedules and treat them as my resources ya know", "Definitely feels like boss/employee vibes", "Asking myself this very frequently lately", "Yes! I've been in a couple of scenarios over the years where I've had to cancel plans because I've been sick, and immediately it's eye-rolling and saying how her schedule is already full, how will we ever make this up and barraging me with times to reschedule. Just sucks the fun out of everything", "WTF? \u2018Not a reliable friend\u2019 would be if they DID promise and then flaked. Your friends do not owe you chore-type favors scheduled an inordinate amount of time in advance. If they do agree to such, it is an EXTREME KINDNESS that you should consider yourself very thankful and possibly somewhat indebted for, not something you should be mad about if they don\u2019t say yes.", "She is 100% this personality type.

Frankly, there are LOTS of things that are better than watching her dogs and you\u2019re well within your rights to put the decision off until you know what you\u2019re facing.", "I think I've got to that point", ">she'll never take no for an answer and she'll try to negotiate to turn my \"no\" into a \"yes\"\n\nThe fact that she tries to negotiate is exactly why you should NOT explain your reasons to her. Because it implies there's a specific problem and if she can find a solution then you'll do what she wants.\nJust stick to:  \n\n\"No\" or   \n\n\"That doesn't work for me.\"\n\nIf she persists either repeat the exact same thing or say \"Asked and answered\" and change the subject.  If she keeps asking, end the conversation - even if that means hanging up on her.\n\nShe's a pusher, so you need firm boundaries.", "Money is a huge factor when having a pet. Your so called friend doesn't want to spend money on a pet sitter or resort which is why she's pressuring you.", "That part burnt my bacon \ud83e\udd2c", "Time to fire her as a client then, because she's not acting like a friend.", "No dogo, so no problemo. Lol", "Is she actually a friend (someone you enjoy spending time with, someone who offers you support as well as asking for it), or is she just someone you've known a long time and don't hate?\n\nWould you be sad if you two just never got around to getting coffee ever again?\n\nIf she is a friend, setting a kind, firm boundary of \"I am no longer willing to watch your dogs\" is likely to annoy her in the short term but she'll move past it.\n\nIf she's not a friend, setting that boundary might mean the end of the acquaintenceship.\n\nEither way, I think it's worth setting that boundary now. If you want to be kind, you can check the reviews of local boarding/pet-sitting services and suggest a couple for her, but you're not obligated.", "This I can identify with! I have multiple calendars (phone, paper one in purse, one on fridge for the house to be aware of what\u2019s coming up\u2026) especially when you have kids (even for folks that don\u2019t), some months there is something going on every single weekend and multiple week nights, and when a friend asks if I want to grab dinner or drinks I feel bad because I have to say \u201cmy next free weekend is end of April\u201d. I feel like a bad friend because this person wants to see me but I can\u2019t typically rearrange things to make stuff work without some notice. Then of course some days I AM free they aren\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t see this as talking to someone like they\u2019re an employee\u2026 but  expecting you to be free for her whenever she needs because you don\u2019t have things scheduled out like she does?! That\u2019s nutty behavior. Just tell her you don\u2019t schedule things that far in advance because if you have to cancel, that\u2019s going to leave her in a worse position. She\u2019s super type A and probably has a ton of anxiety about getting this task crossed off her list.

She didn\u2019t even bother sending an emoji back in all those months. Nor texted to wish me a happy birthday the month before. But boy, was it easy for her to pick up that phone when she wanted me to look after a dog so her family could attend a wedding! She tried to counter every reason I gave and eventually I ended the conversation.\n\nIf she hadn\u2019t ghosted me previously, I\u2019m not sure I would have reflected too hard on that request or the bulldozing of my boundaries. As I reflected on our relationship, I realized that in many ways she\u2019d treated me as a second class friend since we were kids and was continuing the trend as an adult. Even though we were \u2018besties\u2019.
