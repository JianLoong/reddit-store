Seriously consider whether you want to keep those friends.", "NTA - Dogs should not have beer (or any other form of alcohol). When you bring an animal into your home you are accepting responsibility for it. Dogs deciding not to drink the beer because they don't like the taste is not the same thing as a human making the decision to drink alcohol or not depending on their personal feelings about the risks/benefits of doing so. Dogs trust and rely on their humans to make good decisions for them. \n\nWill one beer cause lasting harm to a reasonably sized dog? No, probably not. But there is absolutely no reason for them to give the dog beer accept their own selfish, immature, and abusive hope that the dog would drink it and act intoxicated in a way that would be amusing for them. \n\nGiving the dog a beer was a stupid and AH move that demonstrates a lack of maturity. His refusing to take responsibility and admit that they were wrong to do so is even worse. And I don't care if his friend is the one who actually poured the beer. Your partner should have told him not to or dumped it out. Saying \"oh, it wasn't me that did it, it was F\" is just another sign that your partner is immature.", "Question...so you used a computer to write this, but didn't use one to look up how alcohol effects dogs so that you could have a better argument than it is stupid?", "YTA if you let this person back in your house.

They're dogs not humans so they're different species from us; what works for us doesn't work for them and vice-versa. From all you and they know, this could have killed your dog(!!) so your partner is the AH for allowing the friend to give your dog beer without even caring to check it out first if dogs can drink alcohol, and even more so the AH for not seeing what the problem is for doing something that he didn't even know nor checked if it was gonna be dangerous for your dog and trying to shift the situation to a problem of how you reacted to it.", "NTA. their ignorance that dogs can't process alcohol like humans can is no excuse to give them anything they don't know for sure is safe, and they should never give them anything without asking you first.", "A real reason?

Repeatedly putting it in situations like this is YOUR fault.", "NTA, and I\u2019m going to help you out with how to explain how bad this was to your partner. \n\nAs you said, you can make the choice as to whether you drink alcohol or not; a dog knows they drink from a bowl you\u2019ve placed out for them, and would absentmindedly drink if they got thirsty. Whether a small amount, or a full can, dogs don\u2019t metabolize alcohol like humans do and it can be lethal- that\u2019ll depend on how much they drink and how big the dogs is among other individual factors. Some dogs may leave alcohol alone because of the smell, others may be too curious and drink it because it\u2019s in something you\u2019ve given them free reign to have when the want. \n\nThey did it meaning no harm, but intention doesn\u2019t matter when the impact is markedly negative. A simple Google search shows that you shouldn\u2019t give dogs any amount of alcohol. \n\nPeople make mistakes out of ignorance all the time, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reason to leave your partner as others have said. However, how they respond to hurting you and/or your dog is a marker for what you can look forward to in that relationship. \n\nThe point to drive with them here is not that they gave your dog alcohol- the damage is done and hopefully your dog is fine- it\u2019s the understanding that what they did was unquestionably harmful and it\u2019s not ok to give pets/babies/people something that will cause them to be intoxicated without them/their caretakers knowing.", "NTA\n\nIt's animal abuse.  There is absolutely no reason to give animals intoxicating substances.", "NTA.  That is animal abuse.  While it might be some fairly  \"light\" animal abuse.. it's still not great.. and you have every right to be upset about it.  On another note.. your partner is OK with animal abuse and will even take a position against you to defend animal abuse when their friend is the one doing it.  Good luck when you run into a more serious version of this story...  where it's not just a lil beer in a dog bowl under question.", "NTA. Dump him.  I never come here with that advice but this is quite literally animal abuse. Alcohol is extremely toxic to dogs and can cause liver and kidney failure, not to mention other issues that can come froms animals ingesting alcohol. The fact he's minimizing this and actually gave the okay - I would 100% leave him. If you don't, I would never allow these people alone around my dog ever again.", "NTA -  next time tell them the dog prefers Bollinger", "NTA your boyfriend and friend are though", "NTA.
