Whereas I (47f) am more nurturing and guiding to our two kids. This has been a huge source of conflict in our marriage since he thinks I make him play the \"bad cop\" while I think he needs to RELAX.\n\nMy older daughter (20f) is in college 2 hours away and she drove here this weekend for Mother's Day. She and my husband argued all weekend. Constantly griping at each other, being sarcastic, etc.\n\nAt brunch today things got out of control. It was started by my daughter who made a remark that my husband is an incompetent cook (he and my daughters cooked home-made brunch) because he never does the cooking for the family. My husband took offense to that and they started arguing. Somehow that conversation turned to her academics and how she failed to get an internship this summer. My husband thinks she half-assed the process and didn't put enough effort in because she was busy partying with her friends.\n\nMy daughter is sensitive about this issue and got very upset. My husband at one point brought up that we are paying her college tuition, so she is accountable to us. My daughter got mad and said some hurtful things to him. He spoke harshly to her and said that she's not welcome here if she is speaking to him like this. This made her get up and leave and drive back to school.\n\nSo brunch was completely ruined. My younger daughter (17f) got upset by the conflict and was mad at my husband. I was completely pissed at him.\n\nAround dinner time he wanted to take me and my younger daughter out to a nice restaurant as a make-up Mother's day meal but I didn't see the point. I was upset and spoke harshly to him, which did escalate into yelling out of frustration. I spoke what was on my mind, that he had ruined this whole weekend by being a complete ass with our kids and and that this was the worst Mother's day of my life because of him. He started crying and I immediately felt bad for being so harsh but I am still so angry about how he couldn't just let things go with my daughter this weekend so we could all have a nice time.\n\nAITA for blaming him for the conflict this weekend and alienating our daughter into leaving early and ruining Mother's Day for everyone?", "created_utc": 1684128142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hymj3/aita_for_blaming_my_husband_for_arguing_with_our/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was just telling his daughter the truth that she didn't get her internship because she didn't work hard enough. \n\nI'm getting the feeling you have a strong dislike of men. Especially when having any sort of conflict with a woman because men should be kind to women at all times, even when being antagonized. \n\nIt feels like you're just intentionally being disingenuous at this point, and now you're intentionally insulting me by implying I'm a bad parent for not being willing to allow blatant disrespect.", "LOL so how is it making it up to OP? She has two children one that he got into a fight with and now left but now he wants to make it up to her by continuing to exclude her from this make up dinner. \n\nim not cherry picking im. just finding the make up dinner kinda weird", "Op is the wife. Not the daughter. It was Mother\u2019s Day. He wanted to make up MOTHERS DAY by taking the MOTHER, his WIFE, to dinner. To make it up to the MOTHER for the fight that ruined MOTHERS DAY. God damn the ignorance here.", "Again she has two daughters and he was only bringing the one who was at ahome if he wanted to make it up to her he would have also reached out to the older one who he was fighting with to squash it and have dinner. \n\nOP is the mother who wants to have a nice mothers day with her family the oldest is still family. \n\nI honestly dont know what your not understanding about my comment and getting so worked up over."]}
