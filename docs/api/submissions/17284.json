Whereas I (47f) am more nurturing and guiding to our two kids. This has been a huge source of conflict in our marriage since he thinks I make him play the \"bad cop\" while I think he needs to RELAX.\n\nMy older daughter (20f) is in college 2 hours away and she drove here this weekend for Mother's Day. She and my husband argued all weekend. Constantly griping at each other, being sarcastic, etc.\n\nAt brunch today things got out of control. It was started by my daughter who made a remark that my husband is an incompetent cook (he and my daughters cooked home-made brunch) because he never does the cooking for the family. My husband took offense to that and they started arguing. Somehow that conversation turned to her academics and how she failed to get an internship this summer. My husband thinks she half-assed the process and didn't put enough effort in because she was busy partying with her friends.\n\nMy daughter is sensitive about this issue and got very upset. My husband at one point brought up that we are paying her college tuition, so she is accountable to us. My daughter got mad and said some hurtful things to him. He spoke harshly to her and said that she's not welcome here if she is speaking to him like this. This made her get up and leave and drive back to school.\n\nSo brunch was completely ruined. My younger daughter (17f) got upset by the conflict and was mad at my husband. I was completely pissed at him.\n\nAround dinner time he wanted to take me and my younger daughter out to a nice restaurant as a make-up Mother's day meal but I didn't see the point. I was upset and spoke harshly to him, which did escalate into yelling out of frustration. I spoke what was on my mind, that he had ruined this whole weekend by being a complete ass with our kids and and that this was the worst Mother's day of my life because of him. He started crying and I immediately felt bad for being so harsh but I am still so angry about how he couldn't just let things go with my daughter this weekend so we could all have a nice time.\n\nAITA for blaming him for the conflict this weekend and alienating our daughter into leaving early and ruining Mother's Day for everyone?", "created_utc": 1684128142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hymj3/aita_for_blaming_my_husband_for_arguing_with_our/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You guys have to find better ways to communicate and have your needs met. Yelling, name calling, being passive and or petty, and storming out are not good choices.", "ESH. You're daughter wasn't innocent here, they both suck for spending Mother's Day weekend (or any weekend, really) arguing constantly, and you suck for solely blaming your husband. \n\n>It was started by my daughter", "ESH you all sound mean, except the younger one. They're probably so tired of all the bickering you three get up to.", "YTA. So you just disregarded that your daughter was the one who started it? Eh ok. I would be so upset if I were your husband. All 3 of you ganging up on him. He tried to make up for it, but your daughter just left. All 3 of you owe him a big apology.", "Sorry, but YTA. Majorly, IMO. \n\nDad's deserve respect, too. She's sensitive, but she gets to pick her father apart? If she can't talk to him with respect, I see no reason he should be expected to treat her with kid gloves. She's 20, not 10. \n\nShe needs to buck up and you need to not blame your husband for demanding respect from what sounds like a spoiled daughter.\n\nETA- You say you wanted him to let things go \"so we could all have a nice time,\" but I bet if you asked him, having a disrespectful  daughter sniping at him wouldn't feel like a nice time to HIM. You say he needs to relax, but maybe you need to stop relaxing and start backing your husband up on his boundaries. \n\nKids grow up and move away. Make sure you still have a marriage when they're gone.", "YTA no one here can make a full judgement because we don\u2019t see the day to day experiences or relationship of both but in this one scenario the daughter brought it up so it was her fault. That being said it is both of your jobs as parents to diffuse the situation. He should have done a better job at that but your daughter is also an adult she may still be young but what sense does it make to potentially start something on one of the few days where the focus goes on the mom. You could have also called out your husband in a way that was less aggressive while still conveying the frustration and hurt that the arguing has caused you especially when both kids are already blaming him. Everyone except the youngest could have at some point contributed to a better outcome with deescalation so no one deserves full blame.", "YTA.   \n\n\"Nurturing \"  feels like code for \"don't hurt their feelings.\"\n\nIf anything, you may be the one to blame for all of this in the first place.    \n\nMy partner has trouble with discipline too, but she's working on it.    What the end result is that the kids are well behaved for adults... unless she's around.    Mine are only 4 though, I can't imagine what 20 years   of that would do.", "So you don't blame your daughter at all?\n\n> It was started by my daughter who made a remark.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Why on earth is the blame soley on him? Your daughter is an adult and chose to not behave like one! The whole situation would not have happened if she hadnt been a snarky little madam to start off with and thrown shade at his cooking! That was totally and utterly unneccessary. And then on top of that shes mean to him and you berate him? Is this how it works in your family? Your daughters are asses to their dad, he has enough and lashes out and you tell him off? No wonder he emotionally broke down if thats the case! Pull your damm daughter into line and tell her to put her big girl pants on and apologise", "YTA for blaming and yelling at your husband for a conflict which was caused by, and further continued by, your daughter, whom you did not blame at all. You should've backed up your husband and defended him.  Instead,  you let your kid act like a huge brat and AH. Your husband defended himself alone, and his comments back to your daughter were warranted.  And your husband is correct - you do make him play the bad cop, and you don't seem to give your children consequences. No wonder he was crying - everyone in his family, including you,  made him feel like shit for a situation that he didn't start and was defending himself alone in. Also,  the fact that you said \"My husband took offense to that\" in response to your daughter telling him he's an incompetent cook is quite telling about how you view and treat your husband compared to your children. In what world would anyone not be offended to be told that?  YTA so many times over.", "ESH.\n\nY'all need some counseling on communication.", "ESH. Your daughter has no manners, your husband can\u2019t deal with conflict without escalating, and you\u2019re too self-absorbed to do anything at all.", "Yeah YTA, it might be mothers day but that doesn't give you an asshole pass. Why can't you see that your daughter is the one causing issues?", "YTA. She was the one who was rude first I\u2019m 20 also and I would never be that rude to my parents especially unprovoked. The poor dad deserves respect in that family too YTA", "Kinda YTA, You went full on don't rock the boat, only works out for the person who rocks it. People need to be held accountable for their actions, your daughter started it and while he could have paused and taken a step down so could your daughter. In your story it doesn't look like she got yelled at or offered like your husband did to try to salvage things. Then you shoved all the blame on him.  I'm sure it's hard on all of you that she is grown up making more of her own choices and being so far from you all.", "a lot of unaired laundry here. go washing. all 3 adults. ESH", "I feel badly for your younger daughter.\n\nESH. It sounds like your husband is being forced to be the bad guy, but it's hard to tell. You also blamed him for the fight, but told us your older daughter started it? Is he always to blame, or is he always BLAMED?\n\nCouples therapy?", "ESH\u2014this seems like it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s gone on way too long. It\u2019s a bit unrealistic to assume that the kind of conflict your family is going through can just be tabled for Mother\u2019s Day\u2014yeah it would be nice, but these things really don\u2019t work that way. None of y\u2019all should be this bad at communicating effectively and harboring this resentment towards each other. Besides, even though a parent should be more mature your daughter *is* the one who started it, and your lack of standards to hold her to in this scenario makes you just as responsible for this as anybody else", "YTA\n\nLet's recap.... Your daughter disrespected her father. He then called her out for having bad grades (he's paying for college) She again disrespects him, he tells her she isn't welcome in the house if she's going to be disrespectful.... You and your other daughter then blame HIM for this whole situation.... When it all could have been avoided by your older daughter NOT (twice) disrespecting him in his own home. \n\nHe didn't ruin the day, your daughter did. Not once in the entire post did you point out that your daughter was out of line. In fact, you went out of your way to imply what she did and said wasn't really all that bad....\"made a remark that my husband is an incompetent cook\".   \"Said some harsh things\"..... \" \n\nYou then doubled down and said HE needs to \"just let things go\".... Screw that shit, that's his house and he doesn't need to let his children disrespect him in his house. What he needs, is for his wife to not just sit there, say nothing, and then completely side with the disrespectful daughter.", "INFO - so your daughter picked a fight and you're blaming your husband?", "YTA.

It sounds like the husband does not hold back his opinions about the daughters short commings, at why should the daughter? Expecting the 20 year old to be patient and mature but letting the 51 go blameless is wrong in my opinion. \n\n\nThere was no reason to bring her academics into it.

Your husband should be able to lead your daughters not constantly snipe at them. He is the adult, not them. (Brain doesn\u2019t fully mature till early 20\u2019s). He is behaving like a frustrated kid. There is little incentive for your eldest to come home if he continues like this. How can she be honest (now and in the future) with you if he reacts like this when life happens? Even if she did mess up her application/s it is she who suffers the consequences, not him. She will learn. She is accountable to herself, not you! Your job is now to provide a guiding hand: not to interfere. It\u2019s her time to learn to adult: and accept that mess ups do have consequences. Her sister is watching, she won\u2019t make the effort to come home and be honest if it only causes extra trouble, if she comes home from school either. \n\nI think it\u2019s time for some serious talking to your husband.

He seems to have no problem \"calling out\" daughters short commings. \n\n\nWhy is it his money paying for the daughters college and not shared/ops money? \n\n\nIt is werid to me that saying husband is a bad cook (with seems to be true as neither husband nor op denied that) is disrespectful, but deflecting and be like \"but your grades are bad\" is a mature calling out? If I told my father he is a bad cook (he is) he would either laugh about it (okay, they don't have that kind pf relationship) or tell me directly that I'm rude and to act appropiatly.

The notion that a 51 year old man, isn\u2019t able to communicate in any other way than deflecting and defending has me flabbergasted.\nEveryone in this story really is too old to be lacking this level of basic communication skills", "... berating? Making a snide comment is hardly berating. They both were sarcastic and judgemental according to op. Like two teenagers bickering.", "i think you misunderstood the whole dynamic of what happen.  they were laying on to one another and the father decided that his ego shouldn\u2019t have been bruise so he lashed out and pick on things that were not the subject matters (like internship).  without a doubt he was wrong.  that was what cause the fights.  wife later berating him was the direct result of this."]}
