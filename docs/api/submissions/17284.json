Whereas I (47f) am more nurturing and guiding to our two kids. This has been a huge source of conflict in our marriage since he thinks I make him play the \"bad cop\" while I think he needs to RELAX.\n\nMy older daughter (20f) is in college 2 hours away and she drove here this weekend for Mother's Day. She and my husband argued all weekend. Constantly griping at each other, being sarcastic, etc.\n\nAt brunch today things got out of control. It was started by my daughter who made a remark that my husband is an incompetent cook (he and my daughters cooked home-made brunch) because he never does the cooking for the family. My husband took offense to that and they started arguing. Somehow that conversation turned to her academics and how she failed to get an internship this summer. My husband thinks she half-assed the process and didn't put enough effort in because she was busy partying with her friends.\n\nMy daughter is sensitive about this issue and got very upset. My husband at one point brought up that we are paying her college tuition, so she is accountable to us. My daughter got mad and said some hurtful things to him. He spoke harshly to her and said that she's not welcome here if she is speaking to him like this. This made her get up and leave and drive back to school.\n\nSo brunch was completely ruined. My younger daughter (17f) got upset by the conflict and was mad at my husband. I was completely pissed at him.\n\nAround dinner time he wanted to take me and my younger daughter out to a nice restaurant as a make-up Mother's day meal but I didn't see the point. I was upset and spoke harshly to him, which did escalate into yelling out of frustration. I spoke what was on my mind, that he had ruined this whole weekend by being a complete ass with our kids and and that this was the worst Mother's day of my life because of him. He started crying and I immediately felt bad for being so harsh but I am still so angry about how he couldn't just let things go with my daughter this weekend so we could all have a nice time.\n\nAITA for blaming him for the conflict this weekend and alienating our daughter into leaving early and ruining Mother's Day for everyone?", "created_utc": 1684128142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hymj3/aita_for_blaming_my_husband_for_arguing_with_our/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both she sounds like the only one who doesn't, she is pissed at the father therefore father is as complicit in ruining mothers day.", "A 50 year old should be more mature than sniping at his kid and deflecting though. Seems like she took after her father from what I can tell.\n\n\"You're bad at cooking because you never make food\" \"Well, what about your grades?\" How can any adult think this is a mature way to respond?", "It's what started the entire fight - they all made brunch for mom, daughter said he was useless in the kitchen. Where I work, we've gotten 1700 applicants (and counting) from graduating class of '22, but people aren't getting employed from their last internships, so they take another. I don't know one field where college degree applicants are not being bounced from internship to internship.", "I also like how making up to her involves not bringing the older daughter that he fought with to the dinner", "finally a comment that makes sense. I feel like the people here are just happy to rip a woman apart for fun", "YTA. Support your husband when he's being blatantly disrespected by your daughter. \n\nIt seems like you're so concerned with your kids liking you that you can't comprehend being harsh with them. You say he needs to relax, but how about you be more firm and demand respect. \n\nAll of this could've been avoided if you had spoken up from the beginning and told your daughter, \"Don't speak to your father that way. He and your sister worked hard on this meal.\" \n\nBut you can't do that, can you? That would require you to stand up to your children. \n\nYou need to apologize to your husband, and then *ASK* him if he's willing to apologize to your eldest.", "ESH except the youngest. It feels like there's more to this story. Everybody's right. You guys need counseling. My family could only communicate by fighting, and I left the country to get away from them.", "Your daughter started the fight, but you seem to give her a pass on causing an argument.  My impression is that you like to attack/blame your husband and your daughter has learned to attack/blame him, too.  It seems like your lack of discipline has resulted in a rude and disrespectful daughter.    \n\n\nOverall, YTA.  You created these dynamics by failing to teach your daughter to behave with basic respect and attacking your husband when he tries to correct her bad behavior.  Good parenting involves both love and discipline.  He seems to be the only one who understands that.", "ESH. \n\nIt should tell you something if your normally stoic 51yo husband started crying. I don\u2019t know many men that would do that in front of *anybody*. The man got eviscerated by his daughter in his own home and I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t the first time because he\u2019s the \u201cbad cop.\u201d I don\u2019t blame him for lashing back out even if it was on your special day. The man has probably earned that clap back. I\u2019m sure he does other things like HELP PAY for your extremely bratty daughter\u2019s school. She was old enough to know better than to start something (making digs) she couldn\u2019t finish (hearing about her lackluster performance).", "We don\u2019t have enough info, based on the snippet you gave it does sound like your husband escalated the situation (because not being able to cook is something some people can make jokes about. Not having the academic success you wanted isn\u2019t and bringing up that you pay her tuition sounds like a threat to take it away), but we have no idea who instigated what and who started what for all the other arguments they had during the week.", "NTA. There seem to be a lot of fragile men commenting on this post that can\u2019t conceive of the idea of letting things go for one day. Was OP\u2019s daughter being disrespectful: yes. But as the adult he could have chosen not to engage or escalate. Heck, he could have told daughter to cut it out and think of her mom. Instead, he launched into his own barrage of petty insults and sniping.", "NTA. It seems like your husband has been upset with your daughter for not getting the internship without thinking about how hard it must be for your daughter. Did he start the fighting this weekend? Because based off of how you described him, he probably did. Your daughter finding a way to hurt him makes sense if that is the case, but you all need help. This is a very toxic situation and it\u2019s probably constantly like this? You guys need family therapy", "Late to the party, but I don't get all the Y T A judgements. The daughter is only 20, and the dad, the \"mature\" one chose to escalate it - on Mother's Day! He knew he screwed up, and tried to have a \"make-up\" dinner. He cried because he knew he screwed up. You will be NTA if you can forgive him (he seems contrite) and move on.", "YTA - it does sound like you\u2019ve painted him as the \u201cbad cop\u201d when all he\u2019s doing is parenting.", "YTA", "NTA he is the adult and should have realized that brunch was not the place to bring up serious life stuff\n\nYour daughter should be talked to, but it seems her and your husband have the same way of reacting\u2026wonder where she learned it", "ESH, why are you two still married if you both constantly fight?", "She isn't a teen.

I\u2019m a woman and *I\u2019m* an incompetent cook because my husband is an excellent cook, enjoys cooking, and that\u2019s that.

Why is that cause for World War 3?", "There are two parents here. \n\nHe says she makes him the bad guy, so this isn't a one time issue. The poor guy sounds hen pecked. Did he handle it immaturely? Sure. But the rest of the family played a huge part and the mom had ZERO reason for throwing a total tantrum about it when the fault was clearly laid equally at her daughter's feet. I stand by my vote. \n\nThe dad laid down boundaries after a weekend of not getting along- respect me or leave. It is his house. He is entitled to feel safe and not attacked there. It was mom who flipped out and claimed that he should be a punching bag so she could enjoy her brunch. Not cool.", "Or maybe its the mom? \n\n\u2705No boundaries for kids\n\n\u2705Hurtful ad-hominem attacks\n\n\u2705Yelling and screaming\n\n\u2705Resistance to de-escalation\n\nReading the back half of the post, she really sucks", "She had already left that's irrelevant dude.", "She was literally a teen less than a year ago.

And the little had nothing to do with her age, good day to you", "Well you sound pleasant to be around. \n\nIts not disrespectful to point out that someone doesn't do something. It is however, disrespectful to lay into someone for not having the skills when they tried to do something they typically don't do. \n\nHe made an attempt at something he clearly doesn't know very well, to do something for his wife on Mother's Day. It takes zero effort to recognize that. Instead, the daughter decided to make him feel awful about his lack of skill.", "Yes, it sounds like he didn\u2019t help much with the brunch or things didn\u2019t come out right, because of him, and she was pointing that out (in a relatively teasing way, but to address the fact that he\u2019s never cooked for the family). That sounds like a relevant and fair point, especially if he\u2019s consistently quick to criticize (as is depicted) and constantly judge the daughter. She was on edge all weekend because of his behavior per the mom and the mom and sister were mad at the dad\u2014sounds like he can consistently dish out criticism to his daughter under the guise of \u201cparenting\u201d but not take it, which is some hierarchical BS. It didn\u2019t sound like the daughter said anything untrue or took a different, worse tone from his typical established one (hers seems softer than his actually) so he\u2019s being hypocritical. If he wants support for his shortcomings, he should model that, but he seems to have done radically the opposite and seek things to criticize at every turn, even perhaps some things outside of daughter\u2019s control (maybe she wanted a particular internship and did work hard but that wouldn\u2019t be enough to get it\u2014we know from OP that if husband isn\u2019t much of a cook, seems like that\u2019s true at least, but we don\u2019t really know if she worked hard at that or not, or if she didn\u2019t get an internship for some other reason etc).", "Yeah this is the thing. We don\u2019t all have to be good at everything. I\u2019m an incompetent cook (I can do a few meals) and I\u2019m happy to admit it, but I\u2019m not some AH who likes to criticize others like the Dad and ignore my own shortcomings. This conversation was started by the daughter but the general conflict seems mostly on the Dad\u2019s attitude to me.", "Okaaay... that escalated quickly. I actually agreed with most of your post but yeah, I do think 20 is a grown adult because... it is. She can be held legally accountable, so she's an adult. We don't know anything about their sizes, so I assumed \"little\" was in reference to the age because you wrote it right before the age. My mistake.", "Maybe he should instead practice his skill of not being an asshole to his daughter \ud83e\udd37", "I mean, yeah.

Insulting your parent in his own home.\n2. Assuming your snotty attitude takes precedence over a holiday.\n3. Having college paid for and partying instead of working hard. \n\nLet's be real here, we all partied in college, but the dad has a point. If he's paying for it, she needs to do the work AND be respectful. It's pretty simple, really. Most people would love to have their parents pay for their college.", "Nah. I didn't misunderstand. Mom points out that she is the laid back parent and he gets frustrated that he's always the bad guy. \n\nOur family has no \"bad guy\" parent. Know why? We present a united front. Even when we disagree, we tell the kids \"I would have chosen differently, but he's your dad, so you need to treat him with respect.\"  If it's a big deal, I pull him aside and we speak about it privately. \n\nI would never expect anyone in my family to be attacked in their home by a grown adult and then flip out on them for not tolerating it. I'm not saying dad is innocent here- He needs to grow a backbone and be firm without being catty- but for mom to let it get this out of hand without any correction to her daughter and THEN pretend like it's all dad's fault that her mother's day was ruined is just ridiculous.  \n\nYou don't scream at your spouse until they cry. That is abusive. Period.", "It says that it was going on the entire weekend. \n\nCalling someone incompetent when they are in the middle of trying to do something nice is berating.\n\nYes, the dad reacted poorly, but it sounds like this happens a lot and he is fed up with the pass she gets for acting spoiled.", "Its very telling that you don't hold the daughter accountable at all. Either that or you didn't read the entire post. \n\nThe daughter instigated the fight by insulting her father's cooking skills. \n\nAt 20 years old, the kid gloves are off. If you can insult your parent blatantly for zero reason. Then they have a right to give it back to you.", "We don't know the tone that was used for the insult. She may have been trying to make light hearted banter that he took the wrong way.\n\nWho's snotty attitude? \n\nDad assumes she is partying instead of working hard simply because she didn't get an internship. We don't know if this is true or now, just that he assumes it is.  Also, college kids shouldn't be working hard all the time or they'll be burned out on life before they even finish school. Just because he is paying for it doesn't mean he's allowed to control her life still. The only thing he should be concerned about is if she passes or fail. And if she is in the running for internships at all, she must be passing, so he needs to back off."]}
