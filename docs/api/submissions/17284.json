Whereas I (47f) am more nurturing and guiding to our two kids. This has been a huge source of conflict in our marriage since he thinks I make him play the \"bad cop\" while I think he needs to RELAX.\n\nMy older daughter (20f) is in college 2 hours away and she drove here this weekend for Mother's Day. She and my husband argued all weekend. Constantly griping at each other, being sarcastic, etc.\n\nAt brunch today things got out of control. It was started by my daughter who made a remark that my husband is an incompetent cook (he and my daughters cooked home-made brunch) because he never does the cooking for the family. My husband took offense to that and they started arguing. Somehow that conversation turned to her academics and how she failed to get an internship this summer. My husband thinks she half-assed the process and didn't put enough effort in because she was busy partying with her friends.\n\nMy daughter is sensitive about this issue and got very upset. My husband at one point brought up that we are paying her college tuition, so she is accountable to us. My daughter got mad and said some hurtful things to him. He spoke harshly to her and said that she's not welcome here if she is speaking to him like this. This made her get up and leave and drive back to school.\n\nSo brunch was completely ruined. My younger daughter (17f) got upset by the conflict and was mad at my husband. I was completely pissed at him.\n\nAround dinner time he wanted to take me and my younger daughter out to a nice restaurant as a make-up Mother's day meal but I didn't see the point. I was upset and spoke harshly to him, which did escalate into yelling out of frustration. I spoke what was on my mind, that he had ruined this whole weekend by being a complete ass with our kids and and that this was the worst Mother's day of my life because of him. He started crying and I immediately felt bad for being so harsh but I am still so angry about how he couldn't just let things go with my daughter this weekend so we could all have a nice time.\n\nAITA for blaming him for the conflict this weekend and alienating our daughter into leaving early and ruining Mother's Day for everyone?", "created_utc": 1684128142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hymj3/aita_for_blaming_my_husband_for_arguing_with_our/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
