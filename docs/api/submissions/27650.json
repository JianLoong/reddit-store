(I have three, 2 bio, so I\u2019m not anti-natal). \n\nHave people generally helped? Yes. Is this a responsibility owed by those who don\u2019t want it? No.\n\nOur village may include some family, but it\u2019s also friends and teachers and community members.\n\nI\u2019d never leave my child with someone who doesn\u2019t embrace the chance to spend time with them. Unfair to both.", "Did you miss the part where they said to go NC?", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be THAAT nihilistic", "Tbf this is precisely why no one gets single authority launch codes!", "That\u2019s so misogynistic and bigoted! Immediate red flags, block him and go NC!!!", "Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to other people\u2019s help, resources, or time. They not the parents so they\u2019re not their responsibility", "Interact with them, like say hello sure. But not \"help raise them\". Op's sister has some problems that would make it difficult for her to raise the kids. Why should op do it for her and not... idk, the kids's dad??", "No, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s entirely possible not to have a lot of contact with kids in a typical adult life if you don\u2019t have kids yourself. Even if you don\u2019t make a point of avoiding it.", "Wildly inaccurate. I *rarely* interact with children. I have 2 nieces and 2 nephews on my side of the family, but they live 1000 miles away. I only have a couple friends who have children, who I've only interacted with a handful of times. Now, once my wife's brother has kids, we will probably see them more often then other children, but that will be mine and my wife's choice if we do, as we are very close with her brother. And we will still have *plenty* of boundaries. We aren't free babysitters. And we never will be. No one has to \"get over\" shit, because no owes shit to anyone else's kids.", "Not necessarily. Some grandparents have a wonderful relationship with their grandkids, without actually looking after them. They see the children in their parents' presence. They play with them, give them gifts, take an interest in them, do activities, go on vacation... You can take an interest in them and love them without having to change diapers or deal with their daily tantrums.\n\nIf someone is \"allergic\" to children and can't even bear to play with them, that's another story and it's extreme because they're first and foremost members of your family. They're not just children.", "You're literally arguing that people are obligated to provide childcare for kids that aren't theirs. You're not going to win there.", "Being required to babysit someone's kids isn't what family means. It's nice if they want to, but no they don't have to.", "My favourite aunt, the one I\u2019m by far the closest too, has never ever watched us.", ">if you don\u2019t like my kids don\u2019t expect to be welcome at family functions\n\nLol awesome. I'd love that, actually.", "What's terrible about not liking kids? It's normal. And this isn't about an emergency. Op said her sister deals with issues that would make it difficult to raise the kids. What she is asking op is to basically be a co parent. Why should op sacrifice her life to coparent kids she never asked for and aren't hers??", "It's not terrible to not like kids.", "Also, even if they hadn't said NC, it's still pretty rediculous.", "I would like to believe that as well, but stupid runs deep in our species unfortunately.", "Marinara! Yogurt! Art. Room!!!", "Well I sure hope they don\u2019t need help in the future\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f because anyone that\u2019s ever helped someone has given up their time", "Then how tf did you get close to someone who you never saw \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Lmao... it's sad that I know what  you're  referring to\ud83d\ude01", "What an intentionally dense, dumb response. You can have a fantastic relationship with someone who does not babysit you. My closest grandmother never babysat us. We absolutely loved her. But my parents never foisted us off on her for free childcare either. She was mostly a wonderful grandmother, and we saw her plenty, but were never expected to be cared for by her - because, y'know, that's what parents are for. You've got some really brain-dead takes on this one, dude."]}
