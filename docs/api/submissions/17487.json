The correct way to do dishes is to scrape off chunks of food and place the unrinsed dishes in the dishwasher.", "But they don\u2019t clean them like you can put them back in the cabinet, they do a brief rinse", "There\u2019s a lot of things, like sitting on the floor even when it\u2019s the floor in my own room, having to put away stuff I\u2019m working with immediately even if I\u2019ll come back to it and it\u2019s in my room or the cat loft (old ledge in the barn), I have to know when I\u2019m being talked to even if I can\u2019t hear I\u2019m being talked to or can\u2019t understand it because she\u2019s speaking to me with her back turned (when I ask her to face me she gets upset), if I spend too much time in my room I get in trouble too, if I look at my phone while watching movies and such there\u2019s a lot of things like that", "What?\n\nYou absolutely should lol, even if it's a quick rinse under the tap. \n\nGetting rid of food scraps and especially oils will serve the machine a lot better in the long run and make sure things are actually properly clean when they come out.", "Why even have a dishwasher if you only put clean dishes in it? Obviously you should scrape off the food chunks, but completely cleaning the dishes twice is just silly.", "He properly cleaned them", "He did properly clean them though. He fully hand washed them and she still had an issue with it. She just sounds controlling.", "Tough food scraps can sometimes stick to the dishes, even after the dishwasher has run. This is why most people rise dishes first, with hot water. If she\u2019s only expecting you to scrub off the major debris before they go in the dishwasher, then that sounds pretty normal. If she\u2019s expecting them to be completely devoid of even a tiny bit of food, that sounds excessive.\n\n**However, this approach to the problem will get you nowhere.** It\u2019s stepmom\u2019s house, and you\u2019re not going to achieve anything by arguing over something this small. If this is really the biggest point of contention, I would let it go. You said she has other rules you find confusing \u2014 are those also cleanliness based? If so, maybe she has high standards or some form of OCD or germ phobia. Maybe you two just have different preferences. Either way, it\u2019s easier to jive with someone\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d rules when you have a thorough understanding of WHY they want things done that way. It may be beneficial to have a calm discussion where you ask her to clarify any rules that are frustrating you.\n\nAnyway, leaning a very soft YTA.", "That is because hand washing with soap doesn't get the dishes as truly clean and sanitized as a dishwasher does.  You scrape the food off because solid food waste clogs up the filer in the dishwasher.  This can create mold and cause the dshwasher to smell and not actually clean things.  Your step mom asked you to do a simple task of rinsing off the dishes and instead of doing it, you then decided you are just going to do your own thing.  Not intentional but YTA", "It\u2019s possible OP misses spots when they clean it by hand and SM notices it and tells them it\u2019s dirty, when OP thinks it\u2019s clean. I clean my dishes before the dishwasher too. Just to get grime off with soap but not to a degree I would consider it clean. We have a friend that insists on cleaning them by hand when she\u2019s over and didn\u2019t used to put her stuff in the dishwasher. Issue was the dishes she washed by hand were always still dirty and the dishwasher needed more dishes to fill it up to run it any way. OP just follow the dishwasher rule it does make sense that being said it seems like some of her other rules are a bit much. Do you think she may have some OCD?", "My dishwasher specifically says not to pre-rinse dishes before loading them into the dishwasher. The dishwasher is 4 years old.", "Agree 100%", "If I put non-\"clean\" dishes into my consumer dishwasher, they come out with food residue still on them. I use a sponge or brush to get all the food matter off plates, then put them in the dishwasher. I don't use soap for this, only if I'm hand washing the item rather than putting it in the dishwasher.\n\nMy husband is less diligent about this than I am. Every time I unload the dishwasher after he has loaded it, I find a handful of items that I need to scrub and run through again, because they are obviously not clean.\n\nNot all consumer dishwashers are the same, not all soaps are as effective, not all homes have the same water quality. If I didn't get the food off my dishes before putting them in the washer, I'd be getting Last Monday's Soup 2.0 with my dinner tonight.", "I think you are talking about a sterilizer. Many places have them and they are not dishwashers. Dishwashers don\u2019t need dishes to be throughly cleaned, but food does need to be removed first.", "She sounds lovely. /s She also sounds like my mother, a tyrant about HER HOUSE, and she wonders why she's divorced, and all of her kids tolerate her, in very small doses at best. \n\nWhat is your dad's roll in all of this? How is your relationship with him, do you 2 weeks with mom and 2 with dad, how long are you there?", "There's a difference between a \"quick rinse\" and scrubbing the dishes, which you would know if you even read the first paragraph of the article linked above. :)", "They\u2019re not really cleanliness based they\u2019re based on what\u2019s proper, discipline, respect etc\nLike if I spend too much time in my room I\u2019m disrespectful, but if I then sit in the living room doing the stuff I was doing in my room (drawing, looking at my phone, reading) then I\u2019m also rude because I\u2019m not paying attention  and idk I just don\u2019t understand them and when I ask why I\u2019m always told because I said so/it\u2019s the proper way to behave/anything else is disrespectful", "I do scrape off the food before putting dishes in the dishwasher normally, but I don\u2019t use water for it", "Also, completely washing by hand with soap and rinsing with freah water uses both more water and more electricity to heat the water than lightly rinsing with water and the brush and washing with the dishwasher.\n\nThe step mom is correct.", "Fun fact, but running a half full dishwasher still saves way more water than washing by hand.", "I spend every second weekend there, my dad sometimes tells her to stop sometimes, but most of the time he\u2019s just silent. He\u2019s nice but generally anxious to upset anyone, so if he says it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m sitting on the floor she\u2019ll get upset and slam with doors and stuff, so I guess that\u2019s why he\u2019s silent most of the time", "\"Because I said so\" is a useless reason, it generally means 1 of a few things.  \n1 - You aren't worth the time to explain it to.  \n2 - I don't think you are smart/old enough to understand.  \n3 - I don't have  a reason, I'm just making rules.  \n\n\nIt sounds like your dad tried to stand up for you, but got shut down.  \nShe has a point with the dishes, but everything else sounds like she's a control freak. My step gran-parents were like this, nothing I did was correct, even when following the rules.  \nI'm going to go with NTA, she wants respect, but it's a 2 way street.", "I think you're picking the wrong hill to die on here. If you can comply with her *reasonable* asks, then she has a lot less footing for her *unreasonable* asks.\n\nI can't imagine a reason why it would be disrespectful for you to spend time in your room. If you were a guest visiting and you spent the time away from the family you're supposedly visiting, then yeah sure, that would be rude. But if you're doing the dishes, I'm guessing you live there, and you *aren't* just a guest. There's nothing wrong choosing to spend time to yourself instead of giving her (or her kids) all your attention.\n\nHave you talked to your dad about this? It sounds like he sometimes holds her accountable, but maybe not enough. And it would be much easier for him to have those conversations if you're following the *reasonable* things she asks you to do, like rinsing food off of plates before putting them in the dishwasher.", "You need to put this context in the post not just the comments.", "Okay I tried doing that"]}
