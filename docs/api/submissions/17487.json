My generation grew up with parents who insisted on stuff being scrubbed prior to it going on the dishwasher. But back then, you HAD to. Dishwashers generally weren't cool enough to fully get rid of hard, dry, stuck-on stuff.\n\nBut, in the last few decades, dishwashers and dishwasher detergent have changed. Modern dishwasher detergent works because they have enzymes that literally eat away at the residue that's on dishes. If you scrub the stuff clean prior to putting everything in the dishwasher, there's not much left for those enzymes to eat. So they find something else.\n\nLike the dishes or even the dishwasher itself.\n\nSo, by washing everything prior to putting things into the dishwasher, you're actually taking the chance of harming/reducing the lifespan of your dishes and dishwasher.

I have been no contact with him for 5 years now. It's just easier that way.", "Yikes..... seems like NTA", "So on the dishes thing... it really depends on both your washer and the sewer lines. Some dishwashers do a champion's job at breaking down detritus from the dishes. They just shred that shit. Then it passes through a filter and eventually goes down the drain. However, some residue remains in the filter and that needs to be periodically cleaned out.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause modern dishwashers often keep water inside the dishwater at the bottom. They don't drain fully on design, so that it makes it easier and cheaper to wash later. This left over water is usually clean (it's from the last rinse cycle), but if there's enough crud in the filter it can smell. You could just run it on rinse cycle once or twice just to clear it out, but that's water wasteful.\n\nNow, this is fixed by both pre-rinsing your dishes (that is wiping off the worst gunk) and having a good dishwasher in good working order. The older the dishwasher, the generally less well it works at getting all the gunk off. And by rinse, I really mean just use the sink or a brush to wipe off the big chunks and food bits. A little bit of sauce or mashed potatoes isn't going to ruin it. Big caked on grime and whole chinks of food will get stuck in the filter and make everything stink.\n\nI mentioned sewer pipes, because that detritus that goes past the filter can, especially if it is grease, get clogged in the pipes and cause issues. A lot of dishwashers will actually drain into the pipes under your sink (often around or under the disposal) and the pipes for that are actually rather small can be prone to clog. Unclogging them is as simple as unscrewing some pvc pipe and pushing the gunk out, but brother, let me tell how much that stinks. It smells like Satan shit in your pipes and then crammed a dead weasel in there for good measure.\n\nSo it's probably for the best to actually rinse off plates, pots, and pans before they go in. It helps you from having to empty the dishwasher filter (which should be done at least monthly) from clogging, it helps keep the pipes from clogging, and it helps keep the rinse water from needing to be drained all over again.\n\nHowever, there's also ways to care and maintain ALL of that, from running hot water through systems, to doing a empty cycle for cleaning, to emptying filters, and the like (and the issue is much less the newer the Dish washer), so that above advice is a bit of \"take with a grain of salt.\" It ight not apply to your specific situation (the narrow pipes sure does cover mine, but my washer is brand new and eats food detritus like a god of garbage, I only deal with the filter when my roommates tosses a plate or pan with fishy bits on it in there, and that lasts for one rinse cycle).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHowever the big issue is that your Step-Mother has some very unreasonable demands and what would be best is if all three of you sat down and discussed each issue. You point out the rules you don't like and let her explain why she wants or needs them. You'll need to concede on some issues (sorry but you will) and she will need to do the same. I can't say what rules are her hill to die on, or what yours are, but if neither of you is willing to work together you'll both end up hating each other. Dad should also have a say, since it sounds like he agrees with you on some rules.\n\nNTA - But you should make an effort to try and settle the issues and find compromises and concessions on some things.

OP can send it to stepmom, but she sounds like she's just never dealt with kids before with her silly little rules and I doubt it would change her mind.", "I pre-rinse mine because hand washing tends to leave greasy residue 1/2 the time and i don't have a food grinder in my dishwasher because i have an old af septic and im paranoid about it. i get the particulate off then let the dishwasher sanitize it. \n\nBut honestly id be glad if my stepkid put things in the dishwasher OR washed them and put them away.", "I'd start eating off of paper plates & cups, but I'm sure she'd get made about that too.", "I'm not sure if you've seen it but just this morning on reddit was a study where they tested bacteria (staph) levels on handwashed versus dishwashed dishes, and there was way more left on the handwashed dishes as the water isn't hot enough to kill them.

That way you remove both food bits and bacteria. Tbf to OP though, some of those other rules sound unreasonable and if stepmom hasn't explained why the rinsing is necessary it's not much of a surprise that OP hasn't bothered to listen.", "Not really.  Washing dishes by hand using a scrubber that isn't brand new is just rubbing bacteria all over the dishes.  The water in the dishwasher is much hotter than what comes out of the tap, that combined with the soap is strong enough to destroy the bacteria.\n\nAnd if you don't at least rinse the solids off your dishes, then those solids get stuck in the trap, which reduces the lifespan of your dishwasher and makes it less effective.", "It\u2019s because older dishwashers you had to wash the dishes to get the food off and the dishwasher was basically to sanitize the dishes. It was still way quicker to do a quick wash and put them in the dishwasher to sanitize them compared to really scrubbing and properly cleaning the dishes.

New one have to get all the stuff off so they look visibly clean, then use the dishwasher basically just to sanitize. If you have any grease/junk it will come out just like that. So this is very much dishwasher dependant. If she says to prerinse them, then prerinse them.

I was so proud of myself, and was just waiting in my room for my Mom to come home and be happy the dishes were done. \n\nInstead, she came home to a kitchen full of suds.", ">Also, you think someone is on chemo here?\n\nYeah, Chemo is an out patient thing in the states. I know of three people personally who live at home, and my mom and grandmother when they were alive were never in the hospital during the course, only during the hour(s) of actual treatment. Most people go home after the drugs are administered.\n\nDo you think everyone on chemo gets put into a secure room with seals, people in clean suits, and sterilized air pumped in? Chemo is delivered in an IV and you go home (usually) afterwards. The end cases get those cleans rooms, and sad to say they don't stay long (before they die).\n\n>lol they should be in a hospital with a clean room then because the germs on your phone is a lot worst than whatever germs are on a hand washed plate.\n\nMost people with compromised immune systems actually d take care to keep their phones clean, along with their hands, food utensils, and the like. But the key here is most people don't try to eat their phones. Might be different in your house, I can't say, but if you have immunodeficiency for any number of reasons (cancer, HIV, AIDS, organ transplants, malnutrition, certain drugs, issues with the thymus gland or bone marrow...) you really do have to take very careful care of infection. \n\nIt's things like always washing your hands when you touch things, eat off sterilized plates and flatware, not sharing drinks, making sure guests wash their hands, have clean wipes for wiping phones, and generally being a lot more clean and aware of possible sources of bacteria.\n\nMy mom had terrible issues with this when she was in liver and kidney failure. We had to live very cleanly, I had to shower at least once a day, and twice if I wanted to be close to her (like sit in the same bed and watch TV or give her hugs). We had to sterilize all our dishes and wash our hands before we touched anything we gave to her that she was going to eat.\n\nSure, it wasn't a big deal if I handed her a book or something, but if I was going to make her breakfast it was a whole process of washing hands, sterilizing cooking utensils, making sure food was cooked right, clean dishes, and if I tasted anything I had to put the tasting spoon into the dishwasher just in case I cross contaminated.\n\nIt's not a joke, people do live like this and a lot more than you'd think.", "Yup. You definitely think that", "Stepmom\u2019s behavior would be over the top for any kid, not just someone with a disability.  She is making him feel bad and undermining his confidence.  She may have a behavior disorder herself (OCD?) and will not change without an intervention.  OP needs to stop staying at her house and go low or no contact with her.", ">a magician when it came to stacking\n\nmy son says I play tetris in the dishwasher", "I guarantee that my dishwasher doesn't do any of that, but I'll definitely keep it in mind when using a modern one!", "I love his videos. It takes someone special for me to watch a like...hour long video on dishwashers, of all things.", "So there's a reason they use commercial dishwashers with water that exceeds certain temperatures in professional kitchens.\n\nThere is a risk with almost all household hand dishwashing. The risk is minimal enough that it's unlikely to ever have an effect... and if it ever does have an effect, the chicken or fish for dinner itself will be the more likely recipient of blame.\n\nYou can go your whole life hand washing dishes and never get sick. You can also end up spreading some salmonella over the dishes and tossing them in a cupboard and contaminating all the \"clean\" dishes. We take risks everyday. hand washing dishes is a small risk and most people end up fine.", "My wife and I think we are doing well to remember to do it around spring ahead, fall back time, when we also don't remember to change the batteries in the smoke detectors.", "For sure, but I had friends with similarly strict rules from their parents, obviously they hated it as teenagers but I\u2019m not sure how uncommon it really is. So that\u2019s why I could go either way, I don\u2019t know that OP would really be justified in just saying \u201cno\u201d to them while she\u2019s over there. She\u2019d be well within her rights simply not to go over there over it though", "I'd suggest just telling your dad you'd rather not visit since all you're getting is this treatment, so you'll just stay at your moms.

I'm just so damn confused by your assumption..", "I have a Miele, and it's great. Get one with the cutlery tray rather than a basket, it's far easier to load and unload and saves space.      \nWith plates I just scrape off any solid bits of meat or vegetables and throw it in there and they come out spotless. Check and clean the filter every few weeks and, unique to Miele AFAIK, if a bit of food or something gets past the filter and stuck in the pump with a Miele you can reach in and unclip the main valve and clear the pump blades by hand. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcRTDo3wZi8", "He's allowing you to be upset. Why isn't he caring about that? As I said above, I'd suggest just telling him that you're not going to visit his place any more because of his wife's behaviour. No one can force you to go. Even a court who ordered a schedule will listen to a seventeen year old and respect their choice.", "Would it help if you wrote down what you want to say (so it's all there on paper, when you're calm and away from them, so you won't panic or \"chicken out\" because they're breathing down your neck)?\n\nAnd then only bring it up with your dad. He needs to step up and support you, even if his wife gets mad.\n\n(I said in another comment that the things your stepmom is getting mad at you about sound like symptoms of neurodivergence, and I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who saw it! \ud83d\ude1c I'm also autistic+ADHD, and like your mom, I was diagnosed at 40...)\n\nDo your dad and stepmom know your diagnosis? \n\nDo they know anything about autism and ADHD?\n\nYour dad needs to have your back, especially now that y'all know the reason why you do the things your stepmom forbids is *because* that's how neurodivergent brains work.\n\nThe floor is more comfortable than chairs.\n\nWe hyperfocus, which means 1) we often don't realize how much time has gone by and 2) if someone tries to talk to us we may not even hear them at all, because brain is focused on something else.\n\nWe can pay attention to lots of things at the same time, so even if you're on your phone or doing something else, you are still listening to the conversation and \"participating\" -- sometimes, if they want us to pay attention to the conversation, the neat thing is to *let us fidget* and do something with our hands while we listen (give brain 2 things to focus on and it won't be looking for another thing to focus on... of brain only has one thing to focus on, it will keep looking around for something else to also focus on).\n\nWe often have trouble hearing or understanding people (sensory processing disorder).\n\nYour stepmom is expecting you to conform to behaviors that are unnatural to you -- both your stepmom and your dad need to realize this, and your stepmom needs to knock it off.\n\nI'm sorry your dad is not supporting you the way he should. \n\nAre things okay at your mom's? You don't have to answer here, but if things are better at your mom's, then maybe tell dad that you don't feel like going over to his place because of the way stepmom treats you.\n\n[hugs offered]", "OP, have your mom talk to your dad.  Better yet, if you have a family counselor or mediator, bring it through them.  At 17, you should have a say in what you will tolerate and where you will live.  Any judge in family court would ask you what you want.", "Or she's just neurotic and controlling.", "Literally just in that short lost of rules I identified several that my stepmom put on me & she definitely hates me and didn't want me around, hard agree with you here.", "Exactly. Seems like she's purposefully being a witch.", "I\u2019m so damn confused why you think it\u2019s acceptable to not properly clean dishes", "The hospital I was diagnosed at offered like a crash course in autism and adhd, not specialised to my needs but like a general what is it and what does it mean\n\nThings at my moms place is also hectic because of like my younger sister is very mentally ill, and doctors have been telling my mom nothing is wrong for a long time, so it took my sister throwing vases and stuff at us and biting my mom and then running away for them to take her seriously, so my sister is now institutionalised and they think she has a personality disorder but won\u2019t diagnose her or treat her before she\u2019s 18 (which is incredibly stupid), so my mom is constantly stressed running from court meetings to meetings with doctors so everything has been very hectic the few past years", "Mine has a sanitizing cycle.", "Wow... I'm so sorry, OP. That sounds really rough, for all three of you.\n\nIt could be that your sister is also autistic but has higher support needs than you or your mom do, and because she's not getting the support she needs, her meltdowns can become violent. (I also was diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder, and I've read a few things about how BPD, especially in girls/women/people socialized as girls, can be a result of trauma from growing up autistic undiagnosed... I have zero business diagnosing anyone, and especially not third-hand on Reddit, but... that's a lot of coincidences for your sister...\ud83d\ude1e)\n\nThere is a lot of misinformation out there about autism (STEER CLEAR of anything related to Autism Speaks and anyone who describes herself as an \"Autism Mom\"), so I recommend you do your own research and find other #ActuallyAutistic adults sharing their own experiences.\n\nGood luck \u2764\ufe0f I hope things get better for you, your mom, and your sister.", "Yeah she could be autistic too, they first thought I was schizophrenic but it was just trauma, however her dad is a very abusive man (we have different dads) like manipulative, splitting, amd emotionally and my sister seems to mimic his behaviour, which I guess is why the doctors first choice is a personality disorder, however she\u2019s diagnosed with adhd too and considering autism is genetic there\u2019s a chance and well idk im upset the doctors are being bitches and not helping her, because she doesn\u2019t deserve to be thrown around from institution to institution\n\nThank you very much!", "The comment I responded to literally said that, probably why it was deleted.", "Ugh, your stepmom sucks.  I'm going to try and give her the benefit of the doubt here still and say maybe she's just ignorant and doesn't realize these things are related to ADHD and Autism.  So maybe try showing her and your dad videos that you find relate to you to better help them understand.  And if things don't get better, I wouldn't stay there anymore.  And explain to your dad why so he doesn't think you hate him.

My dad is very anxious, he always thinks what he does is wrong and never good enough, so sometimes if I ask have you done (blank) differently? He\u2019ll kinda get all panicky asking if it\u2019s wrong and I then have to explain I was just curious and I\u2019ve tried telling him he doesn\u2019t need to be so anxious, I\u2019ve also talked with my mom and therapist about it, idk if my mom has talked with him about it tho\n\nMy dad sometimes Googles around a bit himself, however he prefers to just email the hospital questions because he considers it a more reliable source, so I think he has a general idea of how I function, and he tries his best to make structure and such"]}
