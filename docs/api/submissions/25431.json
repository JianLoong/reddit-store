My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well... I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said \"Well, thats pretty fucking gay.\"\n\nNow, I thought it was peak comedy, since it is infact gay.

I won\u2019t lie, as someone who has been out and proud for years that joke made me laugh my ass off. But your son needed support more than humor. In the grand scheme of things though I was expecting much worse from the title, so I think if you just apologize and explain that you meant it in a humorous way and that you fully accept him and his partner, you and your son will be fine.", "YTA but I see what you were trying to do. I'm glad that from the sounds of it, your son has a very supportive parent in you. A lot of us don't, so for real, props to you. But your son only had one chance at coming out to you. It's a big moment for him, and your response was to make a joke. I know you were trying to indicate that this wasn't a big deal to you in a bad sense, but I get why it was hurtful for your son and his boyfriend. Maybe apologizing and asking if you can have a second chance at acknowledging this moment for him would help turn it around.", "You're the funny asshole here.\n\nTrust me, in a very short space of time,  you and your son will look back on the moment and laugh about it.\n\nJust give him time to simmer down, apologise and explain you knew and thought it was very obvious it was just an unspoken understanding and no big deal made about it and again, say sorry for not realising he wasn't yet at the place mentally about the situation that you were and obviously thought he was.", "jokes like that are only really acceptable AFTER you are 100% sure that they understrand you support  them you should have aknowledged his feelings first, then asked to make a tasteless joke", "You made a mistake. I don't think that makes you an asshole. You made a joke that flopped. Now you just have to apologize sincerely and give him an opportunity to have a conversation on the topic that leaves the jokes aside.\n\nYou're doing your best. I say dumb things to my trans son on occasion, and I'm usually forgiven.", "Definitely YTA.  They came to you for support and you tried to be funny about it, without knowing the boyfriends sense of humor.  \n\nI would apologize asap and make sure your son and his bf know you accept and support them", "I\u2019m definitely going to be in the minority here, but nobody on Reddit knows your personal dynamic and this is exactly the type of joke I\u2019d want my father to tell me to lighten the seriousness of it all, but what your son wanted was something more genuine in that moment. You misread the situation but I don\u2019t think that makes you an asshole. NAH, and I\u2019m glad you support your son.", "This is fucking hilarious but absolutely not the right time or place", "I'm clearly outnumbered, but I think NAH. Just somebody that made a joke at an inappropriate time. Who hasn't? You live and learn. You clearly don't judge your kid for his sexuality and I assume you just wanted to show acceptance by breaking the tension with an attempt at humor. Just apologize for joking during a moment that was clearly important to him and ask how you can best support him moving forward.", "I'm glad you're supportive of him, but YTA here, my guy. Learn how to read the room.", "YTA - but it was funny. But Time and place.\n\nYou need to apologise, and also inform him that you've known about his preferences for over a year, and you didn't raise it with him because you wanted him to be comfortable.

So even though this was in the lane of the humour you and your son share, given the timing of it, his sensitivity to the situation meant that it wouldn\u2019t be received well.\nNAH, I just think you need a follow up conversation to let him know you don\u2019t really gaf.\nPeople be gay\u2026", "YTA - that\u2019s funny as hell hahahaha", "YTA. This was a very hard thing for him to do. The coming out story and how you, as the parent, take it is what can set the tone of your relationship with him going forward. Set your son down and tell him you're sorry. Tell him you've always known and you have and always will love him. Tell him you were trying to be funny but realize it was the wrong way and the wrong time to do so. As to him, not knowing you know... well, that's just kids being scared. I always taught my son that there was nothing wrong with loving who you wanted to love no matter the gender. He still feared I was going to throw him out of the house if he told me. It's just them being scared. Just let him know you love and respect him.", "I\u2019m going to say Soft YTA.  You obviously thought he\u2019d catch on the the humor, but he didn\u2019t.  And his boyfriend may not share that sense of humor.\n\nIn time though you\u2019re both going have a good story from this.", "LMFAOOOOOOO. YTA.", "You're gonna get rinsed, but I'll give my gay perspective. Its fine in the end, as long as you talk to him. He's told you something big, despite you already knowing. He'll be wanting some tiny bit of obvious support and a little bit of shock. We fight really hard as teens to hide our true selves, to realise it didn't work hurts a bit.\n\nTalk though, I suspect you're a good dad really.", "YTA for your wording. \n\nIt no doubt hurt your son and his BF. You have no idea as to how his BFs family is when it comes to their relationship so you could have been a 'safe space' for them both to share their feelings and relationship.", "Evidently they're down-lows.\n\nAnd, YTA.", "Yeah YTA, but damn that was fucking funny. Thanks for the laughs!! Now go make it up to your kid!", "YTA, but you just need to make it extremely clear to your son that you completely support him going forward.  Tell him you made a joke because you had already realized it before him telling you.", "NAH. Was it the proper thing to do? No. Is your son going to be upset forever? No. \n\nLet him calm down.

YTA but props to you for being self aware enough to recognize where you messed up", "Soft YTA, but goodness that was hilarious XD", "Yep soft YTA.  You may be easy going and have a wonderful relationship with your Son but that moment for him was one of the biggest of his life.  You had sooooooo much time to prepare a thoughtful, caring and accepting response.  Prepare your apology and heart to heart - how much it means to you that he trusted you with that etc.  think about what made you react that way and tell him.  Maybe you just wanted a joke to let him know that his sexual orientation doesn\u2019t change the relationship\u2026I don\u2019t know that\u2019s your story but what you do next is the memory of unconditional love that he will want to know to his core.

Just take him out for a burger and tell him how you feel.", "NAH\n\nSeems you wanted to convey to them that it was no big deal by cracking a (probably inappropriate) joke. It just wasn't the right context for this. I feel that once this blows over and it's all out in the open, maybe you will be able to crack these kinds of jokes to each other. You're just not there yet and you misjudged. I think you should give him some space, let him know you put your foot in your mouth and it understand it wasn't the right thing to say at the time and apologize. And let him know when he feels ready, you are ready to talk about anything he wants in a respectful way.", "NTA! This is exactly the type of humor we practice in our home.

Even you just said you already knew after the joke would've made it better. \n\nYour son really wants a hug and to be told I love you. The bf doesn't matter his parents can do the same for him. \n\n\nI don't think you're an asshole but don't crack jokes to them until January.", "YTA but this seems like an easy fix.

I LOLed but the timing was horrible!", "Eh, NTA. You guys are going to talk about this and get past it and he's going to realize how lucky he is to have the dad he has. You knew what was coming, he didn't realize you knew and was probably really anxious about telling you, and your attempt at making it feel like NBD didn't land. I can promise you, many parents have reacted far, far worse, and they did so from a place of malice.

You weren't trying to be mean, and you don't seem like you have any problem with your son's sexuality. It was just wrong place, wrong time. Regardless of whether or not your son suspected you knew, coming out officially would still be a big deal to him and you making light of it didn't help.\n\nYou're not a bad person. Just apologize for the joke, maybe tell him that you pretty much already knew (I don't actually know if this is always advisable, maybe someone else can weigh in), tell him you love him and support him, and you only care that he's happy.", "NAH, you just made a mistake because you were taken by surprise. it was not a big deal to you because you have known for a long while and you thought he knew you knew. so your mind was still in a normal estate, like a son just giving you an update on his current dating life. and your relationship with him being edgy banter it just came out before your brain could make the connection \"why is he teeling me this?\" > \"he thinks i dont know\" > \"he is coming out, so it's a big deal for him, not the place to make a joke. definetly not the place to make that kind of jokes\"\n\nif you apologized when you finally connected the dots, i bet your son's reaction really helped too. then i wouldnt call you an A. also the reaction of your son is normal. he will calm down and most likely will forgive you by the mistake.", "Lmao A+ for the joke, made me laugh pretty  hard lol but probably not the most appropriate for that scenario! Although, I totally understand the whole mounth moving before brain can process deal, and it's gotten me in trouble before! I'd say just talk to them and smooth it over and explain that you've known all along and are okay with it, you just were thrown off guard and your mouth went for it lol NAH", "Of course YTA. It was a serious, heartfelt coming-out moment that you ruined with a joke. One that really only made sense under the context that you already knew, which they clearly didn't know.\n\nObviously, all you can do now is keep trying to apologize and explain to them you've known for a while, and it's doesn't matter because you love him.", "YTA, apologize and move on", "YTA. Poor job reading the room.", "That was not the time for a joke. Yta", "ngl i laughed at the joke but what FSUfan35 said just about nails what needs to be done.", "YTA as you know.

This would have been a great ice breaker.\n\nBut not every situation is like mine nor is everyone's personality like mine.", "NTA", "NTA, you made a bad joke. It happens. I make lots of them. And given the range of truly horrible reactions there are to coming out, this was mild at worst and an overreaction on their part at best. \n\nYou admitted your mistake. You apologized. It's clear you don't judge their homosexuality, and you love your son. What else do they want? Let them ask their gay friends in the Bible belt how bad your reaction is.\n\nI know this will be an unpopular post, but come on. Mistakes, esp slips of the tongue, happen frequently. Some people take things way too seriously.", "A gentle YTA. It seems you genuinely support your son, which is good. And I get what you were going for, you were trying to use humor to put him at ease. You also felt taken aback by his not knowing that you knew and were trying to use humor to buy time. However, that was not the place for that. As it goes, a person\u2019s coming out isn\u2019t about you. Your son was being *extremely* vulnerable with you and was looking for gentle support. In addition, he was introducing his boyfriend to you and was likely unsure how you would react to the boyfriend as a person even outside of being a boy. The boyfriend may also not have that style of humor and was likely quite nervous about this. \n\nThis was a time to be gentle and say \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel comfortable telling me this and it\u2019s nice to meet your boyfriend.\u201d You could even throw a \u201cit\u2019s about time\u201d in *afterwards*. But instead you make a joke of it. You readily admit that your mouth moved faster than your brain, so it\u2019s good you recognize that. At this point, I think you need to sit your son down when he gets home and apologize. Be frank and serious about it, but be honest and open. Don\u2019t judge him for how he reacted here. I also suggest you let him come back home on his own terms. Send a text that says something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry for trying to joke like that. I support you and your boyfriend. When you come home, I\u2019d like to make it right.\u201d (Or something like that, I\u2019m not good with phrasing) And then let him be until he returns home.", "YTA.  Read the room, dad.  Your boy needed support and love in that moment, not questionable humour.", "YTA, but as someone who likewise struggles with reading the room, I can totally see that accidentally slipping out based on your description of how you two normally talk to each other. Definitely apologize, definitely try to make up for it, but likely something you'll end up laughing about with him years from now.", "Definitely not the correct time to make that kind of joke but I would have died laughing if my mom had said that to me lol", "Gentle YTA, as if it had been any other point after coming out it sounds like your son would have laughed. But obviously NOT the way to react to your child coming out. I hope things get smoothed out and you and your son can laugh about this later OP", "Nah, that was funny to me but I'm not much younger then you so maybe it's a generation thing. Yeah, it wasnt the greatest timing as his emotions were probably heightened. Next time you see him sit down and explain and apologize. \n\nPersonally if I were in that situation I'd have say gaaaayyyy! like in community. Maybe I'm not the best one to give advice.", "Gentle YTA\nImo you should make sure you tell him that you love him so of course you're aware of his boyfriend. \nApologize for making the joke but say you've known for so long it turned into a comfy fact. Comfy facts people make jokes about. But for him its obviously not comfy fact territory so you're sorry and here for him when he is uncomfortable.", "See this is something I find hilarious being gay, but yeah I can see how if you're 17 and have been really worried about coming out to your dad that might throw you off. Give him space for a bit and when he comes home (I'm assuming he lives with you or did he move out?) reassure him you love him exactly as he is and you just thought you were being funny because you already suspected and probably apologise for throwing him off at a moment that he's clearly been really anxious about. So I guess YTA from your sons perspective.", "Yeah, YTA, but this is something I totally would do\u2014 make a joke about it because it\u2019s all good. Sometimes things just sound funnier in my head (it was funny what you said) but don\u2019t fit the situation. Apologize to your son and his bf for being a dumbass and move on.", "YTA. That was not the time for a joke, especially one that could easily be interpreted as homophobic", "YTA. but you know this already. when someone is being vulnerable is not the time for a joke at their expense. \nMaybe try baking a cake with rainbow frosting and writing \"sorry i fucked up\" on it? would be funny and heartfelt and cover that you love and accept him.", "YTA but that's funny as hell.\ud83e\udd23 Hug your son I'm sure it's gonna be fine.", "You\u2019re not the AH but you\u2019re the AH \n\nNot the Ah because you\u2019re very accepting of him and who he is dating. You\u2019re the AH because you knew you said something that shouldn\u2019t had been said .", "The way I cackled doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that YTA in this scenario. A well-intended joke at the wrong time. You sound like a very loving and supporting father, however, so I\u2019m sure in due time (and after an apology) you\u2019ll all laugh about the situation together.", "YTA, you should apologize.", "Yes, YTA. Apologize in person.", "Aww soft YTA. Could've worded it better but I can tell you're a good dad. Just apologise and explain to him you didn't mean to hurt him", "YTA", "Apologize. Learn to pause before you speak. Test the waters. In the future, tell him the remark was made in the usual spirit of how the two of you joke (\u201cedgy\u201d) and that since it didn\u2019t go over well, you felt bad after the fact.", "NTA, you treated your son, like your son. To me, at least, that\u2019s the most affirmative thing you could do. Shows him that you don\u2019t care about these choices he makes, you feel no different about him, he doesn\u2019t have to worry", "You are a giant immature asshole.", "At this point, your response was poor and ill-timed.  \n\nCorrect this with something over-the-top to show that your feelings are positive and humor is a part of your relationship in the family.  \n\nCookout, party night, something that is family and talk-oriented.  Sharing and talking will make this post a non-question going forward.", "Yes, YTA. He was probably trying to have a moment with you and you definitely didn\u2019t read the room. \n\nHowever, as someone who jokes around ironically with this term with her gay best friend\u2026I laughed out loud when I read this.", "NTA and i'll get hate for it. but we have to normalize not coming out being a big deal. you like boys cool. you like women cool. only way to normalize is to respond from a place of love. sounds like you did. good for you. \n\nmost people don't realize that making a huge deal out of it is what puts the stress on the situation. take the stress out and it's acceptable for all.", "YTA but it's unintentional so just call your son and apologize but just make sure you don't pull the \"it was a joke\" card because this was a very important moment to your son he probably isn't in the mood for jokes", "YTA but it\u2019ll be fine. Tell him you are sorry for making jokes during a sincere moment and that you love him with all your heart and are happy and proud that he decided to come out to you.", "YTA, it\u2019s funny but not for one of the most awkward/tense moments of his life. I get that you thought it was an open fact but he felt he was telling you a secret. That joke is more for like\u2026 several years after he comes out.", "Yta but just talk to him and tell him you love and support him. Tell him you had suspicions and wondered if he was bi and that was the reason for the joke. He's reactionary by nature because he's still a kid but he's also old enough that he should understand where you were coming from.", "YTA.  Jesus man.  You could of smiled and said *I know* and just given them a hug.  \n\nThere is no undoing this.  That being said, you could invite them over/out, make/buy everyone a meal, and while you eat talk to them about how you knew, when you knew, and listen to the things they have to say in response.  Food makes things less formal and it's something to bond over.....fills up all the awkward moments.", "NTA, that truly was peak comedy, and if you guys have the laxed relationship you portrayed, then I don't see why he would've taken it that way. As a bi myself, I didn't feel the need to come out to anyone in my family.", "NTA. I just think you made a mistake which can be corrected through properly communicating with your son. He wanted support and you made a joke. Honestly I was expecting something wayy worse than this but it's still fine and fixable. Just apologize and talk to him and tell him you accept and support him and tell him you're proud of him and I think things should be fine. Everybody makes mistakes but if you learn from them and rectify it then it's alright.", "NTA, it\u2019s funny lol", "Ok, that\u2019s undeniably funny in any other context given the relationship you describe with your son, but you should\u2019ve read the room better in this scenario so technically YTA! I think you can rectify it by choosing your next words with your son and his boyfriend very carefully, essentially say; I realise my reaction was in terrible taste, but because I\u2019ve always known the two of you are together and have absolutely no problem with it, I didn\u2019t grasp the gravitas and importance of you coming out to me. I understand how difficult it must seem, but please know you never have to explain yourselves to me because I one thousand percent love and support who you are.", "YTA for choosing this moment to degrade and minimize your child during a core memory moment. I hope that joke was the funniest thing ever and was worth the life lesson your son just learned, i.e., his close family does not and will not respect him in private and likely not in public. I'm sure you'll be outing him for laughs at public events and calling him derogatory terms affectionately before moving on to other damaging behaviors. Good work, you're on your way to having your kid eventually go NC with you and your hilarious bigotry", "In that moment YTA. \n\nBut in life it sounds like you\u2019re a good parent and have quite a nice relationship with your son. \n\nGive him some time to be angry. Then sit him down and tell him just how much you love him and support who he is. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all laugh about this in time.", "Once he understands that you were already well aware of the situation he might get over it.  From his perspective, that was your very first gut reaction.", "YTA but only gently, damage control will be easy and part of me is here going \u201cdaaaaaaaad\u201d lol", "Soft AH because you blurted it out. I mean do shit like that myself but this was him coming out you with his bf and that already hard as it is right now, especially in this climate. Let him cool down, then apologize to both of them.

Are you?\" \n\nHe first just said no but I knew he was lying so I then said \"well if you are, you know I won't care.

I get it, you were not being malicious and thought it would be funny.  Apologize to both of them and make sure they know that you support them.", "Against the grain, but NAH. You made a joke that was in normal humor for you and your son that didn\u2019t land. You weren\u2019t being an asshole, that\u2019s like peak dad humor. But your son wasn\u2019t looking for humor he was looking for support in that moment. That doesn\u2019t make you NOR him an asshole. How you handle it from here is what makes or breaks your asshole status. Apologize, and make sure he knows he and his boyfriend have your undivided support.", "yta. making gay jokes is for gay people because we have dealt with years of having our identities be an insult. not for you. \n\napologize to your son and affirm that you love and support him, and id apologize to the boyfriend as well. it was an asshole move, for sure, but you can salvage this. if not, its gonna be something your son remembers with pain. \n\nmy dad loves me. i still think he loves me less after i came out because he doesnt know how to interact with me as a man, and the jokes he's made still hurt. it tears me up inside. dont let this happen to your kid.", "Soft YTA. He basically came out of a closet with a wide open door that he didn't know was open. And you made a joke that he didn't get since he didn't know you already figured out he was gay. \n\nApologize, sit down and talk to him. Remind him you love him no matter what and you realize what you said was inappropriate and won't happen again.", "What were you thinking AH", "NAH. You made a dumb dad joke you gotta apologize for, doesn\u2019t make you an asshole imo", "It probably wasn't the right way to respond, but I don't think you're an asshole for it", "I think this is fucking hilarious but also, YTA. Probably a great joke for a few months down the track, but not as the first thing you way when he comes out.", "YTA for the wording, yeah.

I think that\u2019s a good edgy dad joke! I don\u2019t see why the whole thing had to be so serious and emotional if he had been openly LGBT+ this whole time. Honestly, at this point I don\u2019t see why \u201ccoming out\u201d needs to be such a big deal anymore. It\u2019s completely normal, and the few left in society that are so against it are simply irrelevant and you don\u2019t have to associate with them (even if they are family).", "NTA, just really bad with your comedic sense of timing, unless of course you were serious. That'd be an AH move.", "Ehh. \n\nIt mightve come off assholy, but we know that wasnt your attention.\n\nJust have a convo with him- and express you knew he was gay for quite awhile and you thought he knew you knew.\n\nA simple apology and discussion should suffice.", "You are such a dumb ass and you know it. \n\nNow, though, you have a good reason to go all out, pun intended. \n\nThis will be something he roasts you over for the rest of his life and that, in itself, might be a great gift.", "I may be the only one who thinks YNTA, it was a joke, if not said in a mean way and if you both have edgy humour then all good.\nLesb talking here, sounds more like the kids were trying to make a big deal about it, like 'parent poorly reacting to coming out' while you had been aware of it for ages. Don't beat yourself up with it.", "Jokes fall flat sometimes, causing hurt feelings. My brother-in-law (in a same-sex marriage since 2004 when Massachusetts legalized them) makes that sort of \"that's so gay\" joke often. So it could easily have popped out of my mouth too!\n\nI think you're handling it well. It was just a failed joke. Apologize, and hopefully move on. Best of luck!\n\nedit: Oh, and NTA. Not an asshole, just a human making a regrettable but very human mistake.", "YTA, but a hilarious one. Just talk to him, tell him\nYou were a dick, and meant nothing by it. Hopefully it\u2019s something you can both laugh about in a month.", "YTA. It seems you've acknowledged this and are going to try to set it right, which is good! but I want to add something else here.\n\nAre you also LGBT? There is a BIG difference between a gay person making a \"that's so gay\" joke to another gay person, and a straight person doing the same thing. In-community humor is ours to use, when it comes from somebody else it can be very demeaning, rude, and inappropriate.\n\n(That said, even if you yourself are gay/bi/whatever, this would still not be the time and place for a joke).\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if you thought your son knew you knew. You'd never had an actual official talk about it, and this was his chance to make that very scary leap.\n\nHopefully you're able to make amends.", "YTA. You blew it on two counts. Yes, you've met his boyfriend before but this wasn't just your son coming out. It was him telling you that he was in a relationship. Meeting the parents as part of a couple is scary as a teenager. He told you that this person is special to him and you laughed at them. That would hurt regardless of the genders involved.", "as a fellow queer... i laughed my fucking ass off. but yeah, maybe the wording could have been better, this time. write him a letter, explain that youve known a while, that you are fine with it, and you were trying to joke about it. And ask for a re-do, have the BF over for dinner.", "Just text him letting him know it was meant as a joke because you thought that he knew, that you already knew.", "YTA but I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so funny, at least to me. My dad said something similar when I came out as non-binary and he responded with \u201cI thought you were a lesbian\u201d like, fine with it but had no idea about the vine so I burst out laughing much to his confusion. \n\nI\u2019m sure your son will come around, just apologize and tell him what you told us here and that you\u2019re supportive of him, and I\u2019m sure you guys will be joking about it in a few years.", "Funny YTA. I'm sure your son will look back on this moment and laugh.. eventually.. just apologize for sure.", "Listen, man, it was a dick move. Your son worked up the courage to come out to you and that was your response - it's obvious to see how that might hurt. \n\nThat said, you clearly love and accept your son and I'm sure you'll be able to move past this. \n\nSo, yeah, YTA but I don't think you're an asshole on a regular basis. It sounds like you just fucked up here.", "My best friend came out to me and my parents. My mom told him she was proud of him and happy for him.

He looked at my friend and went \u201cyou want a Footlong Italian?\u201d Completely deadpan for about 5 seconds, then beet red in the face howling with laughter. It was a great memory of a great man.

It probably could have been said down the line once he got the \u201cwhew\u201d feeling out of the way but for the first words of acknowledgment proooobably not the best. A high five and a \u201cyeah, I figured\u201d probably would have gone over a bit better you know? I\u2019d maybe sit him down, apologize, say you were just trying to be funny because you already knew he was gay and dating the young man. Also say you were just trying to show that your relationship hasn\u2019t changed and even though the timing was off, you meant it purely to be funny and try and make him laugh in a stressful situation. I\u2019m sure after he processes and you show him your relationship hasn\u2019t changed and you\u2019re cool with it he will settle and get back to normal.", "NTA\n\nThat was actually funny as hell. \n\nI have known some gay people who are super obviously gay, but want everyone to react stunned and commend their bravery when they come out. I've also know non obvious gay guys be annoyed that people didn't know they were gay. \n\nIf your son didn't know you knew, I could see him being annoyed. But if it's obvious, he shouldn't be surprised if people already know.", "I mean,,,great humor, wrong moment.\n\nI alarmist inhaled my chicken.\n\nI would say NTA because it was not meant maliciously.", "Lmfao", "Yeah, the wording was regrettable. Ask them to meet and tell them you've understood his preferences and that you were shocked that he didn't know you knew. Ask for another chance for a completely open and honest relationship. \n\nThey wanted to feel accepted and your comment probably made them feel like you were offended by them.

At a time where he wanted acceptance and love you put humour first. It won\u2019t be loved on this thread, but know how unforgivable that will feel to your son. Everything is magnified in such an intense moment, and your gut reaction was your own satisfaction. For shame.\n\nETA: You literally suspected your son was gay. Not planning how to respond to his coming out is your own ignorance, and I\u2019ll hear nothing else.", "NTA. If the joke had worked, it would\u2019ve been immortal. Apologize and patch things up.", "NAH. I do feel for your son, when I came our years ago I was expecting the worst and in my experience most people prepare for the worst.

It\u2019s a rite of passage and while I\u2019m sure you guys\u2019 sense of humor is on the same page (as a fellow gay, I also loled) the moment was way deeper and called for a different exchange. It minimizes and invalidates the feelings of stress to not uphold the sort of human exchange that happens in these rites of passage.\n\nIf you acknowledge the rite of passage that he\u2019s trying to accomplish, instead of focusing on how little of a deal it is, focus on how proud you are of him for showing bravery and integrity to himself and celebrate it just a lil!

Remember, you are not entitled to forgiveness. If he accepts your apology and forgives, great. If he accepts, but doesn't forgive, that's okay, either forgiveness will come later or never at all, which is also okay. If he doesn't accept, but forgives, okay.

You are in the PERFECT time to tell him \"hey I'm sorry I said what I said, I didn't mean to hurt either of you, and I not only accept both of you and your relationship but already knew about it\". I bet it will be nice and warm for him to be not only heard and supported but also to feel the love you have for him. It can be a little weird, but knowing someone knew who you love before you tell them, says a lot about how they love you back and care about you.\n\nTL;DR: YTA, but don't worry.

Coming out can be a very intense experience and it's probably still raw for him. Like, imagine if you'd just run a marathon, or given birth, or had a near-death experience, and then someone who had deeply hurt you ran up to you and started babbling explanations at you, trying to get you to forgive them on the spot. You'd be like \"NOT RIGHT NOW, DUDE, let me at least catch my breath and shower first.\" (To be clear, I'm not saying it was wrong for you to text him apologies.

The protective instinct kicks in.\n\nYou know your son's sense of humor, and I trust you that he normally would find a joke like that funny. I'm confident that ten years from now, he's going to think it was hilarious. \n\nBut my final ruling is NAH, no assholes here. Your joke was *definitely* tactless, and you should absolutely apologize to your son and ask if he would like you to apologize to his boyfriend.

I think it's funny as fuck, but you gotta understand that even if it's obvious or you know they'll react well, coming out is a scary fucking proposition.

As someone not gay and in a position of power over him *it is just bullying*.\n\nYTA and I am stunned that you\u2019re asking if you aren\u2019t. That suggests to me that you don\u2019t understand the depth of problem reflected in him not answering your texts. You may have genuinely and seriously harmed your relationship with him. You need to understand you really, really fucked up here and that you\u2019re going to have to work to regain his trust. This is not just a joke that landed badly, it\u2019s a serious parenting fuck up. You owe him a sincere, major apology - and don\u2019t you dare make it \u201csorry you didn\u2019t get the joke, sorry you were offended\u201d. The one you\u2019re looking for is \u201csorry that I said something thoughtless, ignorant and cruel, and made you feel unsafe with me.\u201d", "Have you explained everything you said here to him? Since he had no idea you knew, it makes sense that they were both very upset.", "I'd just backtrack, apologize, give him congratulations for finding himself, that you love him and are proud of him, and can't wait to have a dinner with his boyfriend now that they're officially out. And then I'd ask where they stand on edgey jokes like that. My teenager loves them, but also loves to have the deadpan face to make people uncomfortable when they use them, before they crack up laughing.", "Oh it will come back to haunt him, but not in a bad way, rather a \"remember back when...\" - way.", "Two of the most important factors in being funny are knowing your audience and being able to the room.", "You should apologize, but NTA. You didn't mean bad, you made a mistake. Ppl that make mistakes aren't assholes, the ones that choose to hurt others are", "At least you didn't say \"does your other boyfriend know?\"", "Yup. Keep it simple, tell them you love them and you\u2019re sorry, that the joke was in poor taste", "Definitely apologize and if you explain, let him know it\u2019s not an excuse, just an explanation. You could say something like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how I reacted when you told me about your relationship and came out to me. I tried to use humor when I should have just given you support. Thank you for opening up and trusting me enough to share this. I\u2019m happy for you and proud of your bravery\u201d or something. You can also ask him how you can best support him. I wouldn\u2019t mention that you already knew, at least not now and maybe only if he asks if you had suspicions or until he has been out for a while.\n\nYou aren\u2019t really TA in the typical sense, but you are in a lighter way since he likely just needed to be told it\u2019s cool and that you support him. Maybe ask how you can show him support and if you\u2019re okay with it, let him know his bf can come to you for support as well if his parents aren\u2019t open. Personally I thought your response was hilarious, but it wasn\u2019t what he needed in that moment. It would be a funny scene in some coming of age/LGBTQA+ coming out comedy though lol", "You didn\u2019t fuck up on a human being level here.\n\nWhat you did was so supportive and loving and caring, you went over the line for someone that was either scared by societal expectations or wanted validation because of the former.\n\nYou\u2019re like someone who was so 110% supportive of a buddy while you\u2019re hanging out drinking, you didn\u2019t realize your normal genuine humor and back and forth didn\u2019t match how genuinely 100% this fear had been eating at them for years. \n\nIt\u2019s that sober moment of realizing they needed to hear a little genuine love, when you were giving that in a less direct way. They needed to hear \u201cI love and support you\u201d not, \u201cwhy are you even worried about how much I care about you, you dumbass?\u201d \n\nSpoken from 2-3 very brief moments of whiskey fueled honesty with my own father as an adult.", "Maybe invite them both out to dinner as an apology and so you can show interest in getting to know your son\u2019s partner as his boyfriend now that they\u2019re out and offer the support they need. Don\u2019t assume anything, ask and respond. Be interested and respectful the same way you would if your son was with a lady and you were meeting her as his gf for the first time.", "We need an update when that happens!", "I disagree, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, but you should sit down with him and be genuine and forthcoming about your support, just to put any worries he might have at ease", "Yeah, I get that too. I just assume a proper AH in this scenario wouldn't really be open to the idea that they were wrong, where OP seems to get that he could've made a better choice and isn't defending it.", "Apparently only the top comment matters, FYI. They don\u2019t tally up all the votes.", "Ooooh. My mistake. Fixing. Thanks for letting me know!", "Ah, shit. Sorry, first post here. I'll fix again. I totally should have read the sidebar before posting.", "I haven't looked in a couple of hours, but almost every post when I made my original comment was \"YTA.\"", "Just so you don't feel so bad... here's a quick story.\n\nOne of my roommates in my earl 20s, about 15 yrs ago so a different time, came up to me while we were having a pretty big party everyone real drunk.  I didn't know he was gay at (didn't care either) also didn't know he had come out to my other roommates while I was at a house close by.  \n\nCut to him coming up to me saying he had to tell me something,  first thing that came out of my mouth was \"as long as you're not coming out to me cool\".  This was a complete joke ND as I said I had no idea he was gay. We also always had a very morbid and dark sense of humor together.\n\nThe second I said that his face dropped and I knew I hurt his feelings without meaning to at all.  I apologized profusely and we were laughing about by the end of the night.  Just wrong time for a joke.  \n\nYou support your son and that's all that matters. Yall will laugh about it one day.   Also... really good joke if I'm being honest!", "I get it-- I'm the same way a lot of the time, so is most of my family. Just apologize for joking about something that was a big moment for him, and let him know that you had already kind of pieced it together, which is why you reacted like you did (seems like this is an accurate read, yeah?)", "A good joke is hard to resist. \ud83e\udd2d", "Yep, I have inherited my mom's horrible inability to read the room and go for the laugh first. It has bitten me in the butt several times, but I am learning.  You obviously knew about your son's leanings and were accepting of them before your Hindenburg of a joke took to the air.", "Yeah I got both from my parents and it actually helped. I'd been so nervous that a little bit of gentle encouragement helped alot, then the 4 hour chat we had about it, including the times they'd suspected, was really calming (and funny).", "It's been 20 years and I still feel bad for my reaction when my best friend came out. I said \"Yeah, duh.\" And then that was it. \n\nYears later he told me how hard that was for him, because he had been so nervous and scared and coming out was a huge moment for him. I felt like the \"Yeah, duh\" was my way of expressing \"of course you're gay, I've always thought so, so of course this changes nothing between us, I've always known this to be a part of you, and our friendship remains unchanged, I will always love you and support you!\" but.. it turns out \"yeah, duh\" did NONE of that heavy lifting.", "See me being me I prob would've reacted in complete shock but like an over the top shock (as a joke) cause I think how I would've taken the moment was ...\n\nI've known he's gay. Its been pretty obvious and since this other person has been in his life now for quite some time, again makes it more obvious...but holy shit, he's telling me he's gay. So...did he think I didn't know? Has he thought this whole time that I had no clue?\ud83e\udd14 well shit, I gotta act shocked then! \n\nStart acting shocked, like really shocked for a few seconds+ then calm down immediately and say yeah, no I figured. Totally cool \n\nNot really sure what the point of this was so i guess i just rambled on....anyways, your comment makes sense tho", "Yeah, this was what I was gonna say as well. \n\nMy brother is super gay, like he has two boyfriends gay. But honestly most of my family is queer of some sort so we\u2019ve never cared or made a big deal about it and we all joke with each other. However EVERY single guy my brother with is estranged from 1 or both parents because of their sexuality. All his boyfriends have been utterly shocked by how close my brother is with his family because that\u2019s not the norm they grew up. \n\nAll it takes is an I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019d love to take you both out to dinner to get to know you better. \n\nGood luck! You sound like a fun supportive dad and with a little effort you can easily make this better.", "Hahaha yeah this one made me chuckle for sure. Sometimes it just slips out before you have any time to think and you're like \"fuck, of all things to say, why that??\"", "If you're going to troll maybe get a less obvious username", "https://youtu.be/AcaUZ9R0y2c?si=7BBMbuCVbf1ciwSi", "Makes sense. Give him some space during the week and chat to him when he's home.", "Yeah exactly that it was just an actually pretty great joke at the wrong time\n\nThe parent not being an asshole in general is pretty refreshing for this kind of post", "I'm pretty sure we all feared a worst case scenario upon clicking. OP misstepped, but I can see why his brain went into a joking mode. I hope once they've patched things up, this becomes a moment to laughingly reminisce over, especially since it sounds like joking around is a part of their normal relationship.", "Yes the timing was off. 6 months from now: \"remember when you came out to me but I had already known for a year? That was gay\" \nYour joke was 6 months too early", "I'd follow up my apology with \"I was pretty fucking stupid\" \n\nHoping that the joke lands again \ud83e\udd23", "If your mistakes hurt ppl then it does make you an asshole but being an asshole isn't permanent", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "Would be an NAH, no?", "People who make mistakes aren't assholes, I like that.. but the ones who can't admit they made a mistake while hurting another.. total assholes.", "Imma bounce of this comment a bit, but voting NAH. OP, this person is right. You're not an ahole for making a mistake, but it was one, and that sucks but im sure apologizing is going to go a long way for you. However your son and his boyfriend are also not a holes for being hurt by your comment. We're in a more accepting era overall but when you think your parents aren't, that shit stings.", "He IS a dad after all, dad jokes are practically instinctual. Agree NTA, but only YTA only that a clarification wasn't immediately made.", "I think that probably would have landed better than the joke he made", "Ah, never mind. Now I see. :)", "Are you sure? I thought that you put it in your top level comment, as in, don\u2019t put it in a reply, and then the bot tallies those.", "That totally makes sense. To be clear I don\u2019t think light joking is a bad thing in these convos and can also help the person coming out feel less anxious, I just hope OP has the chance to have one of those long convos with his son after apologizing for his initial remark", "I think most of us who come out and get that reaction know that it\u2019s because our friends and fam are trying to tell us exactly what you just expressed, it\u2019s just hard because it\u2019s the last thing we\u2019re usually picturing when we picture coming out! lol\n\n\nI\u2019m happy you were able to have that conversation later in life though, and the fact that they felt comfortable expressing it to you years later shows how valuable and special your friendship is!", "I read them to my husband and I laugh so hard that sometimes he can't understand what I'm saying cause truly, that shit is freaking funny to me \ud83d\ude02", "While I do love the occasional troll, this is a truthful view and people need to toughen up.  If you enjoy dark humor about others (as does OP and their son) then you can take a few punches yourself", ">Yeah exactly that it was just an actually pretty great joke at the wrong time\n\nIsn\u2019t that what dad\u2019s do? /s", "they'll call it dad's raging hetero moment watch... :)\n\nalso Dad you should probably explain he's pretty and his bf is gay and you knew they were fucking lol \"pretty fucking gay\"\n\ncome on this shit writes itself", "I bet when the healing time is over they will laugh a lot about the misunderstanding and they will laugh even harder about the \"humorous reflex\" of OP. I really hope he shows them this post because the \"Now, I thought it was peak comedy, since it is infact gay.\" part is priceless.", "i think intention has a lot to do with it. tho ignorance isn\u2019t an excuse either", "Yeah and what kind of an adult man involuntarily blurts out \u201cthat\u2019s fucking gay\u201d to his son as he comes out? I don\u2019t believe that OP said that by accident. He thought it would be funny, and he didn\u2019t consider the feelings of the son and boyfriend who were clearly seeking support. He didn\u2019t misspeak, he just failed miserably to read the room. Which I think makes him an asshole in this situation, despite the fact that he seems like he means well overall.", "Mistakes that hurt someone are mistakes and don\u2019t make a person an asshole. Intent makes someone an asshole. If I accidentally bumped into your car, then I\u2019d made a mistake.

OP is an adult and most people would not read this situation as a time to make a joke, if you can even call it that. Even then, he can just apologize to his son and his partner for making an ill timed attempt at humor. Whether his son accepts it or not is his decision. My vote is still YTA.", "Well your intention really doesn't matter its the results of your behavior that do. \"I didn't intend for this to happen\" Doesn't constitute an apology nor does it undo what was done. Owning up to it and showing you understand how your actions effected someone is the best way to go", "Yeah, I heard the same shit when my ex bf left me for a other woman, lied to me about it and I had later to find out on my own and he said \"I lied with the intention of not hurting you\".", "His intention was to be hilarious and edgy when his intention should have been to make his son and son\u2019s bf feel comfortable about sharing their  identity.", "Yeah, I replied again to say that I saw it in the rules when I dug deeper. The first page confused me talking about top level comments.", ">Well your intention really doesn't matter \n\nIntentions matter; they just don't override impact.\n\nIf person A trips and, in flailing to regain balance, accidentally smacks me in the stomach; and person B intentionally smacks me in the stomach; in both cases my stomach hurts, and in both cases an apology is warranted, but I'll be a lot angrier at B because the harm was intended.\n\n\"I didn't intend it\" absolutely doesn't cut it as a response, but deliberate harm is worse than accidental harm.", "Intention very much matters. It\u2019s the difference between murder and manslaughter. Both carry responsibility for the impact, but the intention is a major factor in the severity of consequences. \n\nI\u2019d say in the context of this sub, OP is \u201cthe asshole\u201d but IRL he\u2019s not an asshole, he just messed up. He deserves some consequence (son is pissed, he needs to apologize), but not in the same way that he would if he had actively intended to hurt his son.\n\nI realize that many people use \u201cwell I didn\u2019t mean to\u201d as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for the harm that they cause, but the fact that impact is an important consideration doesn\u2019t negate the need for it to be balanced by intention. It\u2019s not one or the other, it\u2019s both.", "Agreed!"]}
