They already have 6 kids total, the last one born 5 months ago. \n\nYesterday, my sister had announced that she's 3 months pregnant with twins and while everyone was congratulating her, I said out loud \"oh my god, again?? Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" I didn't mean to say it out loud, but it slipped out and my sister looked at me angrily and literally dragged me into another room and asked \"Why tf did you say that?\"\n\nI told her that she and her husband have been pregnant every year for the last 8 years and that she needs to take a break. I was worried about her having so many babies in such a short time and I didn't want anything bad happening to her. \n\nShe then said \"How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit? This is MY life, so f*ck off\". My mother told me that I should apologize for being rude but I told her that I won't apologize for showing concern.\n\nBut now I just can't help thinking that maybe I was being an asshole and sticking my nose into other people's business. I was just worried but maybe I was being a jerk.\n \nAITA?\n\nEdit). Yes, I do babysit my sister's kids sometimes, and all 6 of them at the same time whenever they need me to and if I'm available. They pay me $30-$50/hour, but their kids are pretty destructive and they don't respect other adults like they're supposed to, so it's a full chore watching after them. \n\nI'm aware that the \"stupid husband\" comment was inappropriate, but I have almost no filter and my stupid mouth says shit before my brain can stop it.\n\nAnd ummm.... I've seen some comments talk about the ages and assuming my sister is 21? I'M 21f, my sister is 32f, and her husband is 33m.", "created_utc": 1691087875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hc489/aita_for_saying_again_after_my_sister_announced/", "score": 3877, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said this out loud, and still think you may not be the asshole?

I mean, you probably blurted out loud what a lot of people would be thinking.... \n\nBut yes OP, YTA and your mother and sister are right, it's really not your business and it was a rude thing to say. You are still very young and I'm sure they will forgive you. You might want to also explain that you were NOT ill-wishing these new babies and that you will welcome them with love!", "YTA. Look, I don't fault you for thinking that. All of my SILs are *prolific* Mormon housewives. I have so many nieces and nephews it's obscene. I and my wife make jokes about the eighth kid rappeling down the umbilical cord or falling out *when we're alone together*. In front of the rest of the family? We offer our congratulations. She could be perfectly healthy. Sure, maybe not, but she is right, that is none of your concern. If she's not having massive issues with the pregnancies and her husband has never given you abusive vibes, their incessant breeding is really none of your business.\n\nJust apologize and explain that you were initially concerned, but now realize that it's none of your business. Maybe throw in that you were being biased because you could never have so many children unless something hinky was going on, but you realize that your sister isn't you, and that you just happy to know that she's happy and healthy and really feel bad about embarrassing her and yourself in front of the family.", "YTA, and you know it:\n\n>I said out loud \"oh my god, again?? Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" I **didn't mean to say it out loud**, but it slipped out \n\nIf you weren't TA, why wouldn't you have just said it out loud?\n\nYou're not concerned, that's an excuse you invented after the fact to try and cover you inadvertent slip-up.\n\n>Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\"\n\nInsulting her husband alone is a TA, but trying to police her body is just gross.\n\n>I was just worried but maybe I was being a jerk.\n\nYes.

You are the asshole", "I mean, yeah, you know YTA.\n\nBut as Marge Simpson said once: \"Well, yes, it's true, but she still shouldn't say it.\"", "NTA. We as a society need to move away from this idea that parents are above reproach. That's too many children to adequately care for in today's society. You could have been more tactful, but someone needs to think about the wellbeing of her kids here.", "In my opinion NTA. Thats too many kids to give adequate care to and being pregnant consecutively for that long probably is REALLY hard on someone's body and mental health whether they wanna admit it or not.", "NTA. I feel you girl. 6 kids + 2 coming....omg. Sounds like hell to me.   \nYeah, roast me, Reddit, I don't care", "\" I won't apologize for showing concern.\"\n\nYou only did that AFTER the judgy comment (with bonus husband-insult) slipped out.  YTA.", "NTA what is your sister trying to achieve here... She will probably make the oldest take care of the youngest.  It's really shitty to have so many children there's no way you give them equal time, love etc...", "I mean, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re incorrect, but you are a jerk for actually saying something. She\u2019s an adult, if she wants to have that many kids and she can take care of them, fine. It\u2019s dickish to interfere with other people\u2019s private lives. \n\nI also think it\u2019s ridiculous to put the entire burden of reproductive consequences on the husband. Your sister is obviously a willing participant, don\u2019t act like she didn\u2019t have a say. \n\nI would roast the shit out of these people in private, with my husband, who I know shares my views, but I would never DREAM of actually saying something like this out loud to a person, ESPECIALLY if they are clearly happy about the pregnancy. I\u2019d smear a smile across my face and choke out a \u201ccongrats, you must be so happy.\u201d\n\nJudging by your writing, you seem like a limited family size, pro choice kind of person. Pro choice means that each woman has the right to decide what to do with her body, and while most people think of a woman\u2019s right to choose not to have kids, pro-choice includes women who want lots of babies. If you want her to stay out of your business, stay out of hers. \n\nI agree with your sentiments, but you should have kept your mouth shut. \n\nYTA", "NTA. Someone needed to say it", "YTA\n\n\nBut a very funny one", "I can totally see myself saying \"again??\" jokingly \ud83d\ude01 but to double down and find arguments why they shouldn't have any more kids is a supremely shitty thing to do \n\nYTA", "YTA. Of course you are. If the mom is happily announcing a pregnancy, the only possible polite response is \u201ccongratulations.\u201d", "YTA. Unless there is a legitimate concern based on either their ability to care for so many kids or previous health challenges while pregnant, it's no one's business but theirs. You tried to cover an opinion outburst with sudden concern and got caught.", "YTA, it really wasn't the place for time to make comments. But I'm also wondering what type of bus they'll drive.", "YTA - It was an inappropriate thing to say.", "YTA. The frequency of her pregnancy and number of kids isn't your concern\n\nIf she was continually dumping them on you to babysit then you'd have something to say.

Eight.  You can't raise 8 children without relying on everyone else around you for their time and money.\n\nSomeone needed to say it, I'm sure everyone else is just thinking it and talking behind her back.", "YTA...You definitely have control of what you say out loud, and you knew what you were doing. Your comments are dripping with judgement.  Take your sister's advice.", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry but I'm not one of those people that would hide my concerns if I don't think the pregnancy is good for them. Maybe your delivery was harsh but it sounds like it was unintentional and it really did just slip out. \n\nI didn't exactly have that reaction but I had a relative get pregnant recently and I'll be honest, I thought it was a bad idea for it to be so soon with where they currently were in life. I didn't exactly go negative but I just didn't respond to the news at all for what felt like an eternity (this was probably 10 or 20 seconds in reality). \n\nPoint being people may not like it but I think you're allowed to have concerns about it. But you might have to distance yourself from them if you won't drop it", "NTA, that's way too many kids for a set of parents to give enough individual time and attention to. Not to mention finances and you can bet the older kids will be made to help with the younger ones (not their job) etc. And the fact the planet it overpopulated etc. I wish more people had your thinking.", "People who have this many kids are selfish for so many reasons. So while I agree with you, and think it\u2019s kind of funny, a very, ever so slight, YTA for saying the quiet part out loud.", "Imo it\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it.  Just let it go.  Just half way apologize.  Sorry if i made you feel like i wasn\u2019t happy about you being pregnant, i am and i love your growing family.  I\u2019m just concerned about what having so many babies in so little time might do for your health.", "Sorry, she\u2019s pregnant AGAIN, with twins no less, only five months after giving birth.  Holy fuck NTA, does your sister just not care about her health?  She\u2019s about to have a very rough delivery", "YTA. Terrible thing to say. \n\nAlso, that\u2019s too many friggin kids. But not your place (or mine) to say to her.", "YTA. That said, an asshole can be right.", "NTA. As a kid from a big family, somebody had to say something. You were the only one courageous enough to. \n\nOf course we were raised by our older siblings. My parents are in denial and thought they were great, but I remember it! No one should have more than four kids, even if they have help, because that\u2019s never good for the kids. Especially in such short sequence.", "NTA! Even if the OP\u2019s sister is a multimillionaire with live in Nannie\u2019s, that does not automatically mean that having so many children is healthy or safe in such a short amount of time. And as others have pointed out, you can only give so much attention to each child. \nOf course a healthy family should ideally have unconditional love, but that doesn\u2019t mean we just have to accept every choice our loved ones make. \n\nYes, the way the OP expressed their concerns was not done politely, but maybe this will lead to a much needed family discussion.", "Nta- I\u2019d \u201clet slip\u201d the same thing!!", "YTA. You said exactly what came to mind as I read the details of her pregnancy history but you shouldn't have said that and she is entitled to have more kids if  that's what she wants\n\nAs far as concern for her health, leave that to her doctors. If a pregnancy or future pregnancies would be unsafe for her that's  something her ObGyn will tell her", "YTA. As long as they are taking care of business without your help or the family's help then if they want to have another 4 kids afterwards it's really none of your business.", "YTA.\n\n1. you were SO rude\n2. you overstepped\n3. you have an incredibly immature view on things you seem keen to want to vocalize.", "Is she making you babysit, asking for $$ or complaining to you?

Personally, I don't get people who have so many babies back to back, it wouldn't be for me.

You didn't mean to say it, but you can't take it back. I do believe you're genuinely concerned about her physical health; there's only so much the human body can withstand.

I was worried about her having so many babies in such a short time and I didn't want anything bad happening to her. \n\nShe then said \"How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit? This is MY life, so f*ck off\". My mother told me that I should apologize for being rude but I told her that I won't apologize for showing concern.\n\nBut now I just can't help thinking that maybe I was being an asshole and sticking my nose into other people's business.

OP is an AH for blurting it outloud in the moment, but privately I 100% agree.", "Yes the torn vagina, sleepless nights, shitty diapers, and newborn exhaustion from fking twins wont make her think, but OP's shitty comment is what will work.

I'm oldest of 4. Both my parents worked full-time. My siblings all called me \"mom\" multiple times. Why? Because I was given the responsibility of the role.

Yes, I do babysit my sister's kids sometimes, and all 6 of them at the same time whenever they need me to and if I'm available. They pay me $30-$50/hour, but their kids are pretty destructive and they don't respect other adults like they're supposed to, so it's a full chore watching after them. \n\nI'd argue that if they're already having trouble raising their kids to be decent people (kind, responsible, respectful, etc.) then they shouldn't be having more, because that'll make it even more difficult for them to get a handle on the situation (if they're even trying to do so, because as we know, many parents don't try to raise decent people.

But that was a team effort (she was a stay-at-home mom. He was an architect who worked mostly from home and was insanely good at being able to switch in and out of work-mode. Definitely not someone who locked himself up for hours) and it probably helped that all the kids were well-behaved.

From a person who came from a family of 13 kids, there is always 1 or 2 who disassociate themselves from the group because Mom and Dad did not pay them enough attention or mom and dad gave more attention to their favorite child.\n\nBTW, I married a person who came from a family of 12 children, (religiously belief) BUT we only have 2 children.  Do not have the urge to carry on tradition", "No, it isn't her decision. But it's also telling that the kids already around won't listen to adults. You think that will magically get better with two more kids? It's amazing that people are saying the parents are somehow more equipped because they have more experience when they clearly can't even control the kids they have and are adding more.", "Lol- you think the family was pissed at her *before*? If she taps out before the eldest child can take over, you think they will support her?", "One wonders what her ob/gyn has said to her about this.", "I find it concerning too. She may have waited to have sex until she was allowed to post birth, but they definitely aren\u2019t sticking to minimum recommended spacing between kids (18 months to 2 years\u2026I\u2019ve heard both) in order to let mom heal.

I'm not going to say it's impossible to be an attentive parent when you have 6+ kids, but I think it would take an extraordinary person to be a fully present, engaged parent to 8 kids who are under 8. And that goes double if it's a working parent. \n\nIt's pretty well documented that in huge families like this, the oldest kids basically become pseudo-parents to the younger ones. That's going to be problematic here. A 10 y.o. can't really care for a toddler in any meaningful way.", "This! \nI would argue they aren\u2019t extremely wealthy if they won\u2019t even pay the sister $10/ head for what sounds like a challenging babysitting gig. I would think that number of children of similar age would need extra hands on a daily basis, especially if either or both parents work.\nLike you said, it isn\u2019t just providing the cost-related things like food, shelter, clothing, medical care (!), etc.\nThose kids will be shortchanged emotionally, as well as materially, but I guess for some quantity is more important.\nSadly, her cervix and/or uterus may not hold up under such prolonged stress. Heaven help them if they live in a state where a dangerous pregnancy can become a death sentence.", "Very well said!", "I agree with your sentiment, but including cars is confusing.  That's not a need", "Absolutely. I have 4 kids each a year apart with the youngest now 5. I can afford my kids just fine but spending enough 1on1 time with each child and meeting their emotional needs is really hard. Thats not to mention self-care and spending time with your spouse.

I got them up for school and made them breakfast and getting them on their bus, which included me being late to school and missing my first two classes. My school stayed an hour earlier than theirs and I had to walk to school since I missed the bus. I had to pick them up at the bus stop and get their homework done and get them dinner. It was horrible :( and it ruined the relationship between my siblings and myself as our family dynamic wasn't one of peers.and siblings, but as me as the parent and disciplinarian.
