They already have 6 kids total, the last one born 5 months ago. \n\nYesterday, my sister had announced that she's 3 months pregnant with twins and while everyone was congratulating her, I said out loud \"oh my god, again?? Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" I didn't mean to say it out loud, but it slipped out and my sister looked at me angrily and literally dragged me into another room and asked \"Why tf did you say that?\"\n\nI told her that she and her husband have been pregnant every year for the last 8 years and that she needs to take a break. I was worried about her having so many babies in such a short time and I didn't want anything bad happening to her. \n\nShe then said \"How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit? This is MY life, so f*ck off\". My mother told me that I should apologize for being rude but I told her that I won't apologize for showing concern.\n\nBut now I just can't help thinking that maybe I was being an asshole and sticking my nose into other people's business. I was just worried but maybe I was being a jerk.\n \nAITA?\n\nEdit). Yes, I do babysit my sister's kids sometimes, and all 6 of them at the same time whenever they need me to and if I'm available. They pay me $30-$50/hour, but their kids are pretty destructive and they don't respect other adults like they're supposed to, so it's a full chore watching after them. \n\nI'm aware that the \"stupid husband\" comment was inappropriate, but I have almost no filter and my stupid mouth says shit before my brain can stop it.\n\nAnd ummm.... I've seen some comments talk about the ages and assuming my sister is 21? I'M 21f, my sister is 32f, and her husband is 33m.", "created_utc": 1691087875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hc489/aita_for_saying_again_after_my_sister_announced/", "score": 674, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With 6 kids already including a newborn how do they even find the time or energy to have sex?", "YTA. \n\n>I said out loud \"oh my god, again?? \n\nRude and Asshole behavior, but somewhat understandable. \n\n\n>Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" \n\nWhat is wrong with you? You said this out loud, and still think you may not be the asshole? Get out of here with that nonsense.", "YTA\n\nBut it needed to be said. \n\nYou are a good AH.", "Wait\u2026EVERY year for 8 YEARS??? are y\u2019all mormon or sum", "Ok, I admit it, I laughed when I read OP's post. I mean, you probably blurted out loud what a lot of people would be thinking.... \n\nBut yes OP, YTA and your mother and sister are right, it's really not your business and it was a rude thing to say. You are still very young and I'm sure they will forgive you. You might want to also explain that you were NOT ill-wishing these new babies and that you will welcome them with love!", "YTA. Look, I don't fault you for thinking that. All of my SILs are *prolific* Mormon housewives. I have so many nieces and nephews it's obscene. I and my wife make jokes about the eighth kid rappeling down the umbilical cord or falling out *when we're alone together*. In front of the rest of the family? We offer our congratulations. She could be perfectly healthy. Sure, maybe not, but she is right, that is none of your concern. If she's not having massive issues with the pregnancies and her husband has never given you abusive vibes, their incessant breeding is really none of your business.\n\nJust apologize and explain that you were initially concerned, but now realize that it's none of your business. Maybe throw in that you were being biased because you could never have so many children unless something hinky was going on, but you realize that your sister isn't you, and that you just happy to know that she's happy and healthy and really feel bad about embarrassing her and yourself in front of the family.", "YTA, and you know it:\n\n>I said out loud \"oh my god, again?? Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" I **didn't mean to say it out loud**, but it slipped out \n\nIf you weren't TA, why wouldn't you have just said it out loud?\n\nYou're not concerned, that's an excuse you invented after the fact to try and cover you inadvertent slip-up.\n\n>Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\"\n\nInsulting her husband alone is a TA, but trying to police her body is just gross.\n\n>I was just worried but maybe I was being a jerk.\n\nYes.

You are the asshole", "I mean, yeah, you know YTA.\n\nBut as Marge Simpson said once: \"Well, yes, it's true, but she still shouldn't say it.\"", "NTA. We as a society need to move away from this idea that parents are above reproach. That's too many children to adequately care for in today's society. You could have been more tactful, but someone needs to think about the wellbeing of her kids here.", "In my opinion NTA. Thats too many kids to give adequate care to and being pregnant consecutively for that long probably is REALLY hard on someone's body and mental health whether they wanna admit it or not.", "NTA. I feel you girl. 6 kids + 2 coming....omg. Sounds like hell to me.   \nYeah, roast me, Reddit, I don't care", "\" I won't apologize for showing concern.\"\n\nYou only did that AFTER the judgy comment (with bonus husband-insult) slipped out.  YTA.", "NTA what is your sister trying to achieve here... She will probably make the oldest take care of the youngest.  It's really shitty to have so many children there's no way you give them equal time, love etc...", "I mean, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re incorrect, but you are a jerk for actually saying something. She\u2019s an adult, if she wants to have that many kids and she can take care of them, fine. It\u2019s dickish to interfere with other people\u2019s private lives. \n\nI also think it\u2019s ridiculous to put the entire burden of reproductive consequences on the husband. Your sister is obviously a willing participant, don\u2019t act like she didn\u2019t have a say. \n\nI would roast the shit out of these people in private, with my husband, who I know shares my views, but I would never DREAM of actually saying something like this out loud to a person, ESPECIALLY if they are clearly happy about the pregnancy. I\u2019d smear a smile across my face and choke out a \u201ccongrats, you must be so happy.\u201d\n\nJudging by your writing, you seem like a limited family size, pro choice kind of person. Pro choice means that each woman has the right to decide what to do with her body, and while most people think of a woman\u2019s right to choose not to have kids, pro-choice includes women who want lots of babies. If you want her to stay out of your business, stay out of hers. \n\nI agree with your sentiments, but you should have kept your mouth shut. \n\nYTA", "NTA. Someone needed to say it", "YTA\n\n\nBut a very funny one", "I can totally see myself saying \"again??\" jokingly \ud83d\ude01 but to double down and find arguments why they shouldn't have any more kids is a supremely shitty thing to do \n\nYTA", "YTA. Of course you are. If the mom is happily announcing a pregnancy, the only possible polite response is \u201ccongratulations.\u201d", "YTA. Unless there is a legitimate concern based on either their ability to care for so many kids or previous health challenges while pregnant, it's no one's business but theirs. You tried to cover an opinion outburst with sudden concern and got caught.", "YTA, it really wasn't the place for time to make comments. But I'm also wondering what type of bus they'll drive.", "YTA - It was an inappropriate thing to say.", "YTA. The frequency of her pregnancy and number of kids isn't your concern\n\nIf she was continually dumping them on you to babysit then you'd have something to say. I don't for a minute believe you didn't intend to say it; you think you're superior to her for making different choices or you'd have kept your pie hole shut.", "NTA. She\u2019s a big breeder", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile it was an asshole thing to say... they will have 8 children.  8.  Eight.  You can't raise 8 children without relying on everyone else around you for their time and money.\n\nSomeone needed to say it, I'm sure everyone else is just thinking it and talking behind her back.", "YTA...You definitely have control of what you say out loud, and you knew what you were doing. Your comments are dripping with judgement.  Take your sister's advice.", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry but I'm not one of those people that would hide my concerns if I don't think the pregnancy is good for them. Maybe your delivery was harsh but it sounds like it was unintentional and it really did just slip out. \n\nI didn't exactly have that reaction but I had a relative get pregnant recently and I'll be honest, I thought it was a bad idea for it to be so soon with where they currently were in life. I didn't exactly go negative but I just didn't respond to the news at all for what felt like an eternity (this was probably 10 or 20 seconds in reality). \n\nPoint being people may not like it but I think you're allowed to have concerns about it. But you might have to distance yourself from them if you won't drop it", "NTA, that's way too many kids for a set of parents to give enough individual time and attention to. Not to mention finances and you can bet the older kids will be made to help with the younger ones (not their job) etc. And the fact the planet it overpopulated etc. I wish more people had your thinking.", "People who have this many kids are selfish for so many reasons. So while I agree with you, and think it\u2019s kind of funny, a very, ever so slight, YTA for saying the quiet part out loud.", "Imo it\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it.  Just let it go.  Just half way apologize.  Sorry if i made you feel like i wasn\u2019t happy about you being pregnant, i am and i love your growing family.  I\u2019m just concerned about what having so many babies in so little time might do for your health.", "Sorry, she\u2019s pregnant AGAIN, with twins no less, only five months after giving birth.  Holy fuck NTA, does your sister just not care about her health?  She\u2019s about to have a very rough delivery", "YTA. Terrible thing to say. \n\nAlso, that\u2019s too many friggin kids. But not your place (or mine) to say to her.", "YTA. That said, an asshole can be right.", "NTA. As a kid from a big family, somebody had to say something. You were the only one courageous enough to. \n\nOf course we were raised by our older siblings. My parents are in denial and thought they were great, but I remember it! No one should have more than four kids, even if they have help, because that\u2019s never good for the kids. Especially in such short sequence.", "NTA! Even if the OP\u2019s sister is a multimillionaire with live in Nannie\u2019s, that does not automatically mean that having so many children is healthy or safe in such a short amount of time. And as others have pointed out, you can only give so much attention to each child. \nOf course a healthy family should ideally have unconditional love, but that doesn\u2019t mean we just have to accept every choice our loved ones make. \n\nYes, the way the OP expressed their concerns was not done politely, but maybe this will lead to a much needed family discussion.", "Nta- I\u2019d \u201clet slip\u201d the same thing!!", "YTA. You said exactly what came to mind as I read the details of her pregnancy history but you shouldn't have said that and she is entitled to have more kids if  that's what she wants\n\nAs far as concern for her health, leave that to her doctors. If a pregnancy or future pregnancies would be unsafe for her that's  something her ObGyn will tell her", "YTA. As long as they are taking care of business without your help or the family's help then if they want to have another 4 kids afterwards it's really none of your business.", "YTA.\n\n1. you were SO rude\n2. you overstepped\n3. you have an incredibly immature view on things you seem keen to want to vocalize.", "Is she making you babysit, asking for $$ or complaining to you? Then otherwise congratulate her, STFU and say that in private.", "INFO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre they well off enough to provide financially for all these kids?

Anyway, bottom line, can they actually afford all those kids?", "YTA", "YTA. Maybe come up with a better way to show concern than this.

You were just rude.", "YTA for the comments made and the back track of \u201cI\u2019m concerned for your health\u201d. \n\nSome people want lots of kids and if they have the means to do so, a network that *wants* to be involved and they are making these family planning decisions as a couple, it really doesn\u2019t concern anyone else.", "YTA.

OMG. YTA by the way. But I can understand that you didn't mean to say it out loud, I do this stuff all the time. It just happens. You're a good sister to worry about her, but it's her body her choice. I still can't stop laughing at this because I can't imagine the look on your BIL face or the rest of the family for that matter.

Personally, I don't get people who have so many babies back to back, it wouldn't be for me. That said, it also isn't my business how many babies someone has as long as I'm not the one having to provide for or take care of them.", "YTA - it's fine to be concerned, but there are more tactful ways to show that.

You're entitled to your own thoughts & opinions, but there's a time & a place for everything. If you had spoken to her privately, maybe she would be less salty (hard to tell in this case; it's a predicament). I don't blame you for blurting it out. You didn't mean to say it, but you can't take it back. I do believe you're genuinely concerned about her physical health; there's only so much the human body can withstand.

As long as your sister and her husband are happy, it doesn't matter what you think. Asking what her doctor thinks and if she will be okay, that would be genuine concern.

Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" I didn't mean to say it out loud, but it slipped out and my sister looked at me angrily and literally dragged me into another room and asked \"Why tf did you say that?\"\n\nI told her that she and her husband have been pregnant every year for the last 8 years and that she needs to take a break. I was worried about her having so many babies in such a short time and I didn't want anything bad happening to her. \n\nShe then said \"How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit? This is MY life, so f*ck off\". My mother told me that I should apologize for being rude but I told her that I won't apologize for showing concern.\n\nBut now I just can't help thinking that maybe I was being an asshole and sticking my nose into other people's business.

I\u2019m pretty sure mankind has been rearing families with 8+ kids since the dawn of time.", "Patently false. Plus when you have so many they kinda start taking care of themselves.", "The reason why they did it is immaterial.

Basically older siblings have to step up and everyone had a role in cleaning the house.", "Yep, grew up in a family with 6 kids and I find it very sad when there is large families because I know what it\u2019s like to be lost in that. \nBut my two littlest sisters want large families because they thought it was the greatest ever. Yeah because they had mom and dad to themselves for 8 years and also \u201caround\u201d a helluva lot more before that! Plus they had multiple older siblings to help them instead of being the older sibling who helped.", "Thank you for bringing up this point that I feel like too few people consider.

It was judgement on her behalf, pure and simple.", "That's nobody's business; there's no indication they can't afford it, are bad parents or dump the kids on OP to babysit.", "It\u2019s not like they\u2019re doing it by mistake lol, nobody has to say anything.", "So? It's their choice, people are allowed to grow their families as they choose.", "Sure thats fair but what she actually said does not indicate any kind of concern.", "That wasn't the time or the place for it.

Her body has dealt with the stress of carrying life nearly non-stop for the past 8 years. I'm sure that isn't healthy in the long term, and with 8 children, the older ones will definitely be expected to pick up the slack in childcare, regardless of the parent's financial situation.\n\nQuick edit: forgot these ones are twins and had a brain fart.

Hand me downs! Shared rooms! The horror!! That's life for a huge chunk of people all over the world, and it's a perfectly fine life. Acting like those things are a form of neglect or something is so gross.", "But that's not why she was supposedly concerned - guaranteed that would have been in the post. That's why I say it doesn't really count in this context", "In this context, it does not. Affordability was not listed as a concern. We're judging OP on whether or not she was an AH, not whether we think OPs sis can afford all her babies. And regardless, how is it you know this family and their financial situation? \n\nOP was rude and nasty - questioning her sister's \"stupid husband\" and his libido in front of everyone and then feigning concern about sister's body.

People also had massive families because of child mortality rates.", "I hope this is a joke, because you\u2019re proving my point. Parenting should not be treated like a pyramid scheme.", "Yeah it can be done successfully if half of them die and half of them are forced into dangerous child labour to support the family.

Kids under 3 grow out of clothes faster than can clock it. It\u2019s ridiculous. Buying new for every kid is a waste.", "You were right the first time. Looks like she conceived the twins when she was only 2 months post-partum. Her body never even had a chance to go back to normal.", "Yeah, health-wise I\u2019m giving the side eye. I\u2019d never have 8 kids personally, but, her body her choice. Some people want big families and that\u2019s ok. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terrible thing for kids to have to keep an eye on their younger siblings occasionally. I\u2019m not an old person, but I don\u2019t know when hanging out at the house with your siblings occasionally and maybe getting a snack together became such a repellent idea. Same goes for sharing a bedroom or using hand-me-downs. \n\nReminds me of the whole \u201cwhat\u2019s classy if you\u2019re rich and trashy if you\u2019re poor\u201d idea.

If the kids are clean, have beds, have clean clothes, and can eat, what\u2019s the problem? When people say things like this, I really wonder what they mean. How do you define \u201cafford to have kids\u201d? Because here\u2019s the deal\u2014the vast majority of kids don\u2019t get a new car when they turn 16. The vast majority of kids take out some kind of loan or get a scholarship to pay for college. Before the 90s when suddenly every middle-class family had a huge house, kids shared bedrooms. A lot of them still do. In families where both parents work (most of them), it\u2019s totally normal for an older sibling to hang out with the younger after school before the parents come home, or for siblings to maybe share an old family car and drive someone to soccer practice or whatever. That isn\u2019t parentification, and it isn\u2019t neglect.", "How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit?
