I understand the sentiment of Thanksgiving but it\u2019s not special to me. Before we were married, I spent Christmas with my family and he either works (healthcare job) or spends it with his family. Most of the time he ends up working on Christmas in order to get Thanksgiving off. When he has to work on Thanksgiving, his family celebrates it on a different weekend instead. Without fail, we drive 6 hours to his parents\u2019 house every year and spend a long weekend with them.\n\nWe got married a couple of years ago and now have a little one. I told him I want to celebrate all Christmases with my family since his family gets all Thanksgivings. He thinks this is unreasonable since I don\u2019t celebrate Thanksgiving. He wants to alternate Christmas celebrations between my family and his. I told him that\u2019s not fair because his family has guaranteed holiday time with us every year, whereas my family only would get every other Christmas. He said he would even do every 2 Christmases with his family instead.\n\nChristmas is my favorite holiday and the main reason I want to spend it with my family is that my brother has three kids so it\u2019s more fun. I also just really like to see my family on my favorite holiday. I think it\u2019s fair because husband likes Thanksgiving more anyway. Since he doesn\u2019t want to go to my parents every single Christmas, I asked if I can then opt out of some Thanksgivings and not go to his parents\u2019 house all the time. (I really like his family and I overall have a good time with them but I just don\u2019t enjoy the food or the 6 hour drive.) He doesn\u2019t want that either. His mom is aware that I like to spend Christmas with my family but she has also commented that it would be nice if we make it at their house around Christmas time. Our families live in different states so we can\u2019t really spend each holiday with both sides. My parents\u2019 house is 4 hrs away, his parents\u2019 is 6 hrs away, and it would add an extra 4 hour drive to stop by their house if we were to also see them during the Christmas holiday.\n\nWe both think the other is being selfish in our stances. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I and dear husband are reading all the comments. Sorry if I can\u2019t reply to everyone as I\u2019ll just be repeating myself! I see now that I am being selfish since Thanksgiving is meaningless to me. We decided we will probably \n1- start hosting holidays\n2- spend Thanksgiving with his family and another weekend, or maybe new year\u2019s or Easter with mine\n3- likely stay at home on Christmas and start our own family tradition with our little one \n\nTHANK YOU for the feedback!", "created_utc": 1686193820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143xlln/aita_for_asking_to_spend_every_christmas_with_my/", "score": 847, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From my POV, there are two ways of looking at it:\n\nYour POV: We see your family every year, so let\u2019s make sure we see mine every year too. \n\nHis POV: We see my family on Thanksgiving because you don\u2019t care for Thanksgiving. I want to see my family on Christmas, as most people do, so let\u2019s alternate on the holidays we both actually care about. \n\nNeither of you are wrong or selfish for wanting those things, IMO. You just need to compromise. I get why you view it the way you do, wanting to see family every year around the holidays. I also get why he doesn\u2019t want to just give away Christmas forever - it\u2019s not his fault your family doesn\u2019t do anything/you don\u2019t care for Thanksgiving.\n\nTbh, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to alternate Christmases, or even do the 2-for-1. I think giving up Christmas indefinitely is a big ask. That said, I think he should do something as well to make sure you see family around the holidays too. It may not be feasible with work/finances/will to travel, but that\u2019d probably be a decent place to start.", "When I had kids, my husband and I declared Christmas Day a \u2018No Travel Day\u2019. Our Priest said there were 12 days of Christmas\u2026.use them all. We didn\u2019t like that they would open Santa gifts then have to leave right away. So, no travel. Anyone was welcome to come by our place. Always plenty of food but we would be in our pajamas all day and it\u2019s a lazy day. We celebrated other days with family.", "ESH - you have a little one now, so you may start wanting to do Christmas Day in your own home. The weekend before go to one family, the weekend after/new years go visit the other. Not to be grim, but you never know if some family members will not be around next year.\n\nAs for Thanksgiving, I would continue to just keep that with his family. Perhaps you can make Easter be a holiday you spend with yours. \n\nIf you make visiting family just a box you are checking off each year then you are missing the point. I wish I had another Christmas (or week before Christmas) with my parents.", "Nah.  Every body has to figure this stuff out themselves as a family.  Can you celebrate Christmas with his family at New Years every other year?  Your position is a little unfair in my mind but you know families just need to negotiate this stuff as best they can.  Maybe you host Xmas one year and invite both sides.  Just an idea.", "A fair solution for a common problem. Switching every year is another. Your husband and in-laws cannot reasonably deny it isn't fair to monopolize holidays.", "No one is the ahole you all love your families and want to spend time with them. ComPromise is always the key in relationships. But also do what\u2019s best for your little family u it first. \nCan  his family come spend Christmas at your families or drive to your place instead of having to go there? Maybe one thanksgiving at his families and they come to Christmas at yours \nEtc. That way each family get to see their grandchildren because that\u2019s what they are really wanting to do and no one is left out.  I understand as Christmas is huge for me and my family, and my husband and I had to make choices - we mostly had Christmas with my family and sometimes spent them with his family, but still would have a get together with mine the week after etc. but now we have it here so if people want to see us, they come when we say. The night before / for breakfast or dinner only  or the day after. That way we choose when and we choose what our family needs \nBest of luck!", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH since this is an issue that arises with every relationship, however I think you have more to gain here with your proposition than he does. You guys just have to find a middle ground and I think him offering every 2 Christmas is a good compromise, or just hosting it yourself like others have mentioned.", "My wife\u2019s family has always had a big thanksgiving, whereas my family has not.  So for the past 25 years, we\u2019ve always done her family thanksgiving.  However. We alternate Christmas since my siblings alternate Christmas with their spouses family, so it\u2019s the only time we can all get together.  That\u2019s now the case as well with my wife\u2019s family and her younger siblings who are all married and rotating between her parents and their in-laws.\n\nIn our case, each of our siblings live near our respective parents, so we\u2019ve always sucked up the burden of jumping on an airplane with the kids to visit either family.\n\nDoes your brother and his wife always do Christmas at your parents house?\n\nPersonally, since your family doesn\u2019t celebrate thanksgiving but his does, I think your punishing your husband by insisting Christmas is always at your family\u2019s house because, for you, thanksgiving is just a long weekend at his parents house.\n\nHow many other times a year do you visit each others parents home?", "ESH", "What do you do for Easter ?\n\nYou could host some Christmases at your house for both sides.", "INFO: Can you invite everyone to your house for Christmas?", "Eh.

Kids eventually figure out who\u2019s around and who is not.  My parents only spend Christmas with my brother and his kids (their choice) and my kids (now in college) definitely notice the lack of my family at Christmas.

OP family can get Easter or other holiday.", "NTA I think its fair that you want to spend Christmas with your family and not his, and him saying to alternate between your and his family is not selfish, but kinda unfair. You have a guaranteed time holiday with his family but not with yours. \n\nThanksgiving with his, Christmas with yours.", "NTA Thanksgiving is not equitable with Christmas really.... but this is about time.  \n\nMost people alternate christmases between their families - it doesn't seem unreasonable.  There is only one compromise here - you go to his family's thanksgiving on alternate years same as christmas.  When you have thanksgiving with them, christmas is at your family.  The inbetween years you can start a new tradition with the three of you to do something as a team.  Or just visit your family anyway - even you don't do 'thanksgiving'.........\n\nHe can't have every year at his family for Thanksgiving, and you can't have every year at your family for christmas.", "I think you\u2019re being kind of selfish. Not exactly an asshole though. He offered to compromise. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to alternate Christmas every 1-2 years. You saying Christmas should be with your family every year because y\u2019all go to his family for every Thanksgiving isn\u2019t a good excuse because you\u2019ve said it yourself that you don\u2019t celebrate or care about thanksgiving. I\u2019m sure he wants your child to spend Christmas with his parents sometimes.", "NTA. He has 2 holidays with his family and you only one every other year.", "So u go to ur husbands family on THANKSGIVING which u dont care, which it dosnt matter in this case because your husband like it and he is happy with the arrangement.\n\nBut he should be thinking abt his wife (OP) happiness/fav holiday too which is xmas and he want to do it alternate not each year at your family house.\n\nSo he thinks you are selfish because u dont care abt thanksgiving, but you does sto with him its not like he goes alone to his parents house and its not abt you care or not, its abt he is getting what he wants every year, but he is not willing to give you wat you want every year.\n\nMarrage life is abt compromises but frm both side not only one side, then it is not valued.\n\nMake both holidays alternate to both of parents houses. U compromise a bit and let him compromise bit. This way u get ur holidays and he get his they you both want and it dosnt matter who care abt thanksgiving or not.\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nChristmas is the most important holiday for many families. Your husband offered a nice compromise -- he still won't see his family as often at Christmas.\n\nAnd why should your child only associate the wonders of Christmas with your family? Christmas is the holiday kids tend to remember. They deserve memories of Christmas at both grandparents.", "NTA.  He needs to mature.  Alternate which of the two of you controls the Christmas and Thanksgiving Plans.  One year he controls the thanksgiving plan while you control Christmas.  He can decide to drive to Thanksgiving at his parents, to host a nuclear family Thanksgiving at his house (he cooks), or something else.  Likewise, in that year, you would choose Christmas - away with your family, host your family at the house, just a small Christmas at your house.  All fair as to both holidays.", "NTA. You both need to compromise. Either all of T-day at his and all of Xmas at yours, or some Christmases at theirs but then you get to skip some turkeys.", "See, you want to spend the holiday you don\u2019t value with his family, and the holiday you value - with yours.

It is not as if this is the \\*only\\* time you get to spend together?\n\nYTA", "Yes, YTA for not wanting to share some Christmas time with your husband's family.  It is apparently important to him and his family so your blowing them off completely makes you selfish and inconsiderate. And your excuse that they get Thanksgiving since you don't do that holiday is lame.  I get where you want to continue your traditional Christmases but has it occurred to you he has the same desire to have some Christmases with his family?  You need to work something out that will allow both sides to enjoy some Christmas time with you.  There can be many different remedies for this and I know you can work something out once you are not so rigid about it.", "YTA.  You are using a holiday that means nothing to do but a lot to your husband as a weapon to coerce him into giving up ever spending a different meaningful holiday with his family.  That is deeply selfish.", "NTA. It\u2019s a reasonable a argument that you make. It\u2019s not so much the specific holiday as balancing the time between families. As you get older you may want to opt out of both for Christmas since Christmas morning at home is a big deal for kids.", "Your husband: loves grapes and oranges\n\nYou: love oranges, do not care about grapes\n\nStatus quo: your husband eats all grapes only because you don't really want them, and he eats all oranges as well.\n\nWhat you want: all oranges, despite your husband loving it as much as you do.\n\nWhat you offer, or rather, what you think you are offering: grapes which you don't want.\n\nVerdict: YTA. You seem to think you are already making a huge compromise by giving your husband all grapes, but in reality it's just something you don't want in the first place\n\nSolution:\n1. Split the oranges in a fair manner.\n\n2. Try to love grapes so that you can have a leverage on sharing the fruits i.e. start a Thanksgiving tradition with your own family.\n2a. If your husband is not willing to equally share the fruits then he is the AH and you aren't.", "ESH. It's not fair you only want to spend Christmas with your family. Christmas and Thanksgiving are different holidays. It's not fair that he wants you to spend every Thanksgiving with his family. \n\nWhy don't you start spending Thanksgiving with your family as well not necessarily the holiday but just spending time together. IMO alternate Thanksgiving and Christmas would be better. Thanksgiving with one family, Christmas with the other and then switch every year.", "YTA\n\nOne way to decide if an arrangement is fair is to ask if you'd be happy if it was reversed. What if you spent every Thanksgiving with your family and every Christmas with his? You wouldn't like that because you don't care about Thanksgiving at all, and you do care about Christmas. His family likes both holidays, but they might value Christmas more, or at least want some of both. It's not fair that your family gets the \"better\" holiday every time, even if you get the same quantity.\n\nA fair arrangement would be if you each got every other Thanksgiving and Christmas. But since you and your family don't care about Thanksgiving, you could skip your years and spend it at home if you choose. Maybe see your family some other time of year.", "NTA. Thanksgiving is a holiday that you're spending with his family whether you're sentimental about it or not.

You seem like a very nice person and your husband is lucky to have you", "NTA\n\nGrowing up my family always celebrated a big Thanksgiving with all the family that lived local, and everyone traveled for Christmas.

It's on you that every Thanksgiving is spent with his family. But you can't force him to give up Christmas. I think he did the best compromise with every 2 years. Your parents are only 4 hours away. You could still visit them in the middle of the year.", "YTA\n\nYour parents only live four hours away, you could easily spend every Easter or Fourth of July or whatever with them. Then everyone has at least one visit per year. \n\nThe other solution would be if your husband works every other Christmas, as a good majority of healthcare workers do, spend the years he works with your family and the years he\u2019s off with his. \n\nHonestly, he has already offered a very fair compromise with spending every second Christmas with his family.", "NTA\n\nthe fact that you personally don't particularly care for Thanksgiving in no way changes the fact that your entire family still travels for 6 hours and spends and entire long weekend with his parents every single year\n\nif he gets an entire holiday, then you get an entire holiday too\n\nthe only thing you could offer to be completely equitable is to rotate Thanksgivings and Christmases.

Good luck to you and your families.", "NTA \n\nHe works Christmas so he can have the holiday of his choice with his family, fully aware you don't celebrate it nor enjoy it.\n\nNow he's pissed cos you want the holiday he works and doesn't celebrate with your family. \n\nHe's TA", "NTA.

You suggested compromises but he's doubling down and insisting on it only being done the way he wants. He's being an asshole and unfair to you.", "NAH, nothing about this situation makes anyone an asshole.\n\nBut I do side with your husband. You giving up a holiday you have no connection to is not the same as him giving up a holiday he does care about, even if he cares less about Christmas than thanksgiving, he still cares about Christmas.\n\nA fair exchange would be to do Christmas with your family one year and thanksgiving with his, but then swapping the next year. That\u2019s understandably not a good option either, but asking a person to NEVER see their family at Christmas is a really big ask", "NAH. It is a bit selfish to equate the holidays if you\u2019re giving up the one you don\u2019t care about. I also understand that Christmas is often a time to see family members that live far away from you. Create a rotation and start hosting a few holidays in that rotation. You\u2019re fortunate your MIL understands and is asking for you to be around some Christmases. That is not unreasonable. I spent my twenties driving all over the state of IN from Chicago to make sure both families got to see us each holiday. It was ridiculous and my fault for doing it frankly. I started hosting Thanksgiving years ago and we have a mix of family and friends each year. We also mix up where we go for other holidays. And on very rare occasions we have chosen to not travel on Christmas; those weren\u2019t our favorites but were necessary and we made the best of it. All this to say, be flexible and don\u2019t keep score. The holidays will be more enjoyable for everyone.", "YTA\n\nI could see doing two out of three Christmases with your family.

Sounds like your brother wants his kids to have happy memories of Christmas at home. That doesn't mean literally in the house, it means with the household -- kids and parents experiencing Christmas together in places that make them happy, whether at home or at the beach or wherever.

You could have a dedicated 2nd week in June to visit your family.\n\nHonestly,  as the kid get older, *stay home*.   Kid deserves a relaxed day to stay in pjs, open his toys and play with them.

Simple you go to your family he goes to his. Your child can pick where they want to go when there older. Holidays are NOT a hostage situation.

Your married you guys see each other a lot anyway you do not need to spend holidays together.

It was so stressful and not fun.  We were driving all over the state and half the day was in the car so we never really got to enjoy any one place.  When our son was born I told him I was done - my parents were willing to come to our house and his parents were welcome (I knew full well his parents would not make the drive) but i wasn't dragging a baby around the state and when the kid was older we weren't going to make him spend the whole day driving.", "I celebrate both holidays but if I had to pick only one it would definitely be Christmas.", "Exactly. \n\nOp is celebrating Thanksgiving every year whether she likes it/enjoys it or not.

OP is not being selfish to insist that Thanksgiving be alternated too. IMO, they should alternate both holidays every year. Also, since they have children now, it's not unreasonable to not travel at all. Maybe start hosting one of those holidays every other year?

Gross. \n\nI see your edit that you\u2019re home to start your own traditions/stay home, which is a fine compromise but your husband should apologize for the years of unfairly prioritizing his family and traditions over yours.

Call me a nerd, but this is easily solved with a value optimization formula.\n\n\nThe advice that you should split Thanksgivings (I.E. just spend the time with your family even though there is no celebration) is horrible advice.  It's only justification is to be equal, which is incredibly simplistic.  Equal doesn't mean every last little thing doesn't have to be exactly 50-50.  You get more value from doing all Thanksgivings with his family because it's a tradition.\n\nThanksgiving with his.  Christmas split 1/3 - his family, your family, hosted at your house. Each year your family gets another holiday special to them or one they see as a tradition.  If they don't have one then make one.  Your family unit will be overall more happy if everyone gets the items they place more importance on, it's an overall net positive.", "NAH. \n\nYou could always host. Or celebrate on different days. Or start your own traditions.\n\nIt\u2019s both reasonable to want to spend one holiday per family and to want to spend Christmas with both families. But clearly neither option will work. Honestly, holidays are hard, especially when your families are so spread out.", "NAH. I would suggest a compromise where your family claims a different holiday, if they celebrate any. Christmas has a lot of baggage as \"the family holiday\" so it's understandable that your husband is reluctant. You could also just alternate thanksgiving anyway, even if you didn't celebrate as a child. Never too late to start a tradition.", "My family has a no travel rule for Christmas.
