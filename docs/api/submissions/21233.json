She's been coming to our apartment for roughly 3 months, once a week for 5 hours. She does her work, we pay her, and she leaves. Very few discussions. She likes to listen to her music whilst working, and my girlfriend and I work from home, so we are on calls or busy in general the whole day.\n\nLast week, 20 minutes before she was meant to arrive at ours, she sent me a text message saying her sitter cancelled at the last minute, and that she would be coming with her son. She didn't ask if she could, she just said 'Coming with him'.\n\nOur apartment isn't very large, it's open plan, with only 1 office space. I usually work from the living room, and my girlfriend from the office area, switching around depending on where the cleaner is currently cleaning.\n\nSo, I replied to her, mentioning that we had a lot of calls that day, that there was not any way her son could come with her (on such short notice), and that I understood her situation.\n\nHer son finished school last week (not sure if primary school or just a certain grade) but she was happy about it the week prior and told that she's looking to spend more time together with her son over the summer; so I responded to her saying I am more than happy for her to take these 5 hours and spend them with her son and that I would obviously still pay her for her time; that it's a treat for her son to celebrate finishing school (I was going to give her some extra cash for her son at the end of her shift anyways)\n\nShe replied saying she didn't want our money, and that she went to another house to clean as it's otherwise a waste of her time... I tried to ask her if we are still on for the same time next week and that from the following week I could organise the home a bit better so that if she ever needed to bring her son again, he could come with no issues (I could move my calls to another day so I could work from the bed, or find some other ways of arranging our work space)\n\nShe didn't respond for a few days, and then when I went to message her just now to confirm if she can come, she responded saying that she's sorry but she can't/won't return to work for us.\n\nSo, I'm looking for any way in which I could have come across as an Asshole which would explain her not wanting to return to work for us.\n\nSome thoughts I had were:\n\n1. She felt like a charity case because I wanted to pay her without letting her work\n2. She didn't like being told no to\n3. She misunderstood something I said completely\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nMy verdict so far is that it was a misunderstanding. That either I didn't make myself clear enough that I can make it work from the following week or she misunderstood when I said that and decided it wasn't worth the uncertainty long term.", "created_utc": 1688397168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14plry2/aita_for_telling_my_cleaner_she_cant_bring_her/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a parent, I get it but I also get that just because I am responsible for my child doesn\u2019t mean I get to impose that upon others. This is her work, not summer camp.", "NTA, you basically gave her a paid day off because her childcare fell through. You WFH and have a lot of calls and do not know this child. He might be quiet and would happily follow his mom around and read a book. Or he could be the spawn of satan who screams and breaks things. You just don't know. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA Normally I would say let a great cleaner bring her kid once in an emergency (well, unexpected lack of babysitting) but given that you work from home, I can see how this would not work for you. Your offer to pay her anyway was reasonable and generous, NTA.", "NTA!! At all!! She made a demand, not a request, and you said it wasn\u2019t possible. Then you offered her FREE MONEY and time with her son instead. How you react the way she did, I have no idea. \n\nMy only guess is that she was pissed that you said no to her. Simple as that. \n\nSo good riddance, you don\u2019t need a cleaner with such a bad attitude, and I\u2019m sure you can find another good cleaner easily who has a much better attitude.", "NTA. Whatever the miscommunication, you didn't make it and just like you were willing to extend grace to her she should've extended grace to you if she did feel some kind of way about how you responded. That said, you responded beyond appropriately. Even if you just said, \"no can't lets just pick another day\" would've been appropriate.", "NTA; however, did you say this to her:. ; \n\n(So I responded to her saying)\n\n     \"I am more than happy for her to take these 5 hours and spend them with her son and that I would obviously still pay her for her time; that it's a treat for her son to celebrate finishing school\" \n\n?", "NTA. You offered to give her money for no work and she declined it?! I might be a little offended that you assume the mere presence of my child will render your home unable to get work done in, but any annoyance I felt would be evaporated once you offered to still pay me. and it is YOUR home and work so you get to make that call. She got her feelings hurt a little and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees", "Nta. Your home is not a daycare. It's ridiculous for someone you are paying to come work for you in your home to just assume she could bring a child. You weren't upset with her and even offered to pay her without her working - which was very generous. I have no idea why she reacted like she did, but you are not at fault.", "NAH. She has a kid and has unexpected times come up, and it's likely your alternatives don't work with her, or that she wants clients who are more flexible. Your ask was reasonable, but it's also reasonable for her to decide you don't work as a client longterm.", "~~Soft YTA here sorry.~~ UPDATE: NTA - but you have to accept the decision they made.\n\nI've been at work where someone has had to bring their kid as their sitter cancelled. If the employer allows it (you in this story) its fine. Yes you have a decision but by saying no you are taking away her ability to earn money potentially. Yes they found another job to do and yes you offered to pay them back. But your lack of flexibility is something they picked up on and don't agree with. They are entitled to refuse to clean for you again.\n\nAlso from my experience kids who attend their parents work are almost always on their best behaviour. Had they acted out you could have asked them to leave politely which they would have understood more.\n\nThey informed you 20 minutes before but you gave them 20 minutes to find a new job that will pay her bills for the day.\n\nEDIT: Was wrong in thinking they had replied offering to pay for the day it was done all at once. Its a nice gesture to ensure you keep your standing appointment with them. They didn't take it well.", "NTA\n\nI think it was a simple misunderstanding. Maybe her response was meant as I didn't need the money as I just worked in a different location, so I was not out of pocket?", "My cleaner comes in a spray bottle.", "I'm gonna go with a soft YTA here. I'm assuming based on your post that she's never brought the son over before, so you really have no idea how it would have gone and you just assumed that it would be impossible for you to do your work while her son was there. I imagine that he simply would have gone where his mom goes, therefore the arrangement that you and your gf have to take your calls would not have been any different. \n\nI understand that it was an unknown variable and you never know how it could have gone -- but it sounds like you have a wonderful, professional cleaner that you had a great relationship with, who asked for a little bit of flexibility and empathy for one day, and you didn't grant her that.", "While you certainly did not need to agree to it and she should have asked instead of told you:\n\nI\u2019m curious as to why you weren\u2019t more curious before determining it would get in the way of you making calls. You don\u2019t know the son\u2019s age or temperament or anything, so what made you immediately sure it would be impossible? Maybe he\u2019s older and was going to be assisting her. Or maybe he could have just been playing on a tablet (with headphones on) in the kitchen or whichever room is not where you are. \n\nYou seemed to automatically assume he would be loud and disruptive, which may be true but also may not be true at all.\n\nAnd again, you are under no obligation to agree to it, but you claim she\u2019s the best cleaner YOU\u2019VE EVER HAD. That would be a situation, where I would be willing to at least consider accommodations by asking, follow-up questions, even if I were annoyed at the way, she brought it up initially.

The first time my cleaner didn't even ask me, she just showed up with her 2yo daughter who I ended up having to babysit so she could finish cleaning since the child wouldn't let her to do her job, she came in 1pm and left 8pm and I was furious. \n\nAnd then it happened a second time where she let me know when she was on her way, didn't ask too, just let me know and this time I refused to babysit the child, same thing, came in 1pm left at 8pm and the child was sobbing and screaming for the last 3 hours it's not even a joke, the situation was simply horrible and when she left I was feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nEven if all of this did not happen, I work from home, it is still my house and I get to pick who comes in. I am allowed (and so are you) to not want any kids here no matter what my motives are besides me working from home, and it is still her job and she needs to be professional about it, specially when her kid knows no boundaries and was screaming, grabbing, touching everything I own including annoying my cats.\n\nWhen I comunicated to her that she were not to let this happen again she seemed to feel a bit defensive, which I understand that she might have took it personally since it is her kid but there's nothing I can do about it, I'm setting a boundary and if you don't like it/agree with it there's nothing I can do. Since I understood there would be times where she wouldn't have anyone to look after her child I told her to let me know in advance so we could reschedule. She came in like maybe 3 times after that but I guess things were never the same after that.\n\nYou don't have to worry if you're the asshole or not, it's your house, your life, you make the rules and people don't have to like it. Don't feel bad about setting a boundary. Sometimes people will misunderstand us no matter how clearly we comunicate because they can't help it but take it personally.", "Is English her 1st language?

She may have had another job already lined up for that day that paid more or was more convenient or that already told her she could bring her son every week.

I guess next time just don't say the treat part ...

I mean usually you talk a bit I, so whenever they mention kids, I would probably be excited and say something positive. And then at some point especially if they are younger kids I would just mention it. Like, oh that's great that you have two kids, that's a great age what are their names? Whenever you need to pick them up or they are sick. And I mean kids are getting fast sick, just let us know etc.. I would just have a positive, relaxed conversation about it.", "I don't need a days notice always, but she never discussed this as a possibility with us in the past.

Good cleaners are precious, they getting passed between families and phones kept secret, lol. You were brave, I would not say no to my cleaner.\n\nNext cleaner figure out situation ahead of time, in order to keep best ones you need to be accepting certain emergencies like \u201c I will come cleaning with my sister today and will be done faster \u201c or \u201c have to bring child \u201c. Same with you- if your employer never allowed to go have dental appointment during the day, would you stay? Nope.", "NAH. Good housekeepers are hard to come by and she knows it too.

She had an emergency and is a great cleaner by your own admission.  Why couldn't you just let her come with child in tow and see how it went?  By the way, most kids play on their freaking phone for hours when they need to be occupied.   If the kid really DID disrupt you, you could address it then.  I seriously doubt there would have been any issues.   PS.  You don't even know how old the kid is???   \n\nI wouldn't work for you again either.   Who needs the hassle of someone who can't accommodate you when necessary?  PS.  Your \"she felt like a charity case\" idea is just wrong.

If she\u2019s responsible and has been a good reliable housekeeper I don\u2019t think she\u2019s lying to you about not getting childcare. 20 minutes notice means she probably just found out.

People don\u2019t love being treated like a charity case. She works and tried to make it work with her kid. You didn\u2019t want that and she doesn\u2019t want to accept money for nothing. Don\u2019t treat people any less than you would like to be treated.", "Well, half a day off more likely.  And then what?", "Some people just have a preference not to have kids in their home, or other people in their home... Especially when you have video calls scheduled during the whole time the cleaner is meant to be there. It's not a huge house. It's a 110m2 apartment...", "Definitely.  Maybe not every week but more than once on purpose.  During the school year she doesn't have to worry about child care.  She may have a family member helping her who can't do it every day so those days she's going to play the child care card.  A professional baby sitter cuts into her income too much. \n\nShe needs a client who is ok with her needing to bring her child every time she wants.", "How is a child sitting quietly different than having cleaners in your house during your calls?  I have video calls too.  All day long too.  I just figure it out.  That is why she is upset.  OP did not attempt to create a solution.   He wanted to squash her needs and is now upset because she recognizes her worth in his world.  Why was OP so hip on having his house cleaned on this particular day if he was so worried about these critical phone calls.   It plays really thin to these ears but perhaps I am missing something.", "Having 3 people in 110m2 vs 4 people in 110m2 makes a big difference. Especially when 70m2 of that is 1 open plan living room and kitchen. \nI told her basically straight away that I'd cover her costs for that day and then from the following week organize myself better to accommodate her...", "NTA. I played out a bunch of ways you could have been the asshole in this but you proved each one wrong in your explanation. You wouldn\u2019t have been rude if you had politely said no, that won\u2019t ever work because we work from home and can\u2019t have background noise like that during the day, but you went above and beyond to make up the fact that you couldn\u2019t help out with what she asked for. \n\nSucks that you lost the cleaner though, hopefully you can speak with her and figure out what happened.", "NTA.  She doesn't get to just show up with a kid in your house without permission.", "NAH--she's allowed to quit and you're allowed to make conditions.  You weren't at all unreasonable.  I get that it stinks not having answers, but (especially in an ESOL situation) that happens.", "I worked in a factory type setting, full of hot and sharp things, and power equipment running all over the place. There was a woman there that was in charge of one of the sections who brought her son every single time there was no school. It wasn\u2019t a safe environment for an adult, let alone a kid. He was supervised though. By her daughter. Who was supposed to be working her own job. So basically the company was paying the daughter to babysit while her job wasn\u2019t getting done.", "I\u2019m sorry but it doesn\u2019t sound like you read the whole thing. OP said they told her it would only not work for this one time (which was super short notice) AND said they would even reorganize the house to make sure he could come if it was needed in the future. I get that the cleaner needs to make money, but consideration of children is something that should be worked out ahead of time with plenty of warning. You can\u2019t take one instance where there\u2019s a logical reason for it not to work out for them and decide it\u2019s going to make them inflexible forever, especially when they seem to have made every effort they could to accommodate the child even though it\u2019s technically no obligation of theirs. \n\nChildcare considerations from your employer are a benefit, not a right. If someone says no politely they should be allowed to without being called an asshole or having to provide any explanation tbh.", "It is not uptight to not want someone's child in your house...without permission... especially when that house is also your place of work.", "Some people might find that kind of patronizing. Logically speaking it\u2019s obviously an extremely generous offer, but it\u2019s easy to take things like that the wrong way. Overall you\u2019re still in the right though because she didn\u2019t ask for permission and you tried to be accommodating going forward. Not sure why she decided to pull the plug on a paying customer over this.", "Maybe she wants flexibility, not charity", "A hassle to get paid for the day though? And for him to arrange for it to be possible in the future? She got mad someone told her no.", "Op doesn't need to 'figure it out'.", "Well. Since you have it all figured out and you are right, why are you wasting our time pretending as if you really care whether you were rude or not?   I wish you the best. Maybe she will work with you again.  Maybe she won't.", "NTA. She should have canceled or asked if it was possible for her to bring her son or if not then she\u2019d need to reschedule.\n\nShe was Deeply unprofessional from the start and only ramped it up by throwing a fit and ignoring you when you didn\u2019t give in to her demands.", "YTA.  Unless your calls are protected by confidentiality laws (medical, legal, banking), then there was no reason to not try it once.  We have a cleaner that brings kid when needs and the child is quiet and respectful.  You didn\u2019t even try it.  You don\u2019t have to allow it, but she can stop cleaning for you because if it.", "I work from home.  I don't see a person bringing their child as a big deal, especially for someone I think does a great job.  Sure.  Everyone is free to turn down anyone.  But, don't expect them to come back.  I have no problem with that.  No-one is wrong here.  OP can say no.  Housecleaner can opt not to return.  What's the problem?", "Exactly.    So, he should not be bothering everyone with this problem.  He told the lady no.  He made a choice.  There were consequences.  Live with them.", "NAH\nEvery worker gets to decide if the job is worth it, and self employed people doubly so. You get to decide who you allow in your home.  That said... A great cleaner is worth some effort to keep them and hard to find.", "More like she was setting it up to have her child with her at work all summer.  There are a lot of issues with this child being in your home.  First both of you are working.  Will the child disturb you?  What child will sit quietly for 5 hours in a strange house while mom works?  The biggest is the liability.  What if the child gets injured in your home.  She needs to find a backup for her daycare and bring her child to work.", "If childcare falls though people don\u2019t just bring their children to the office.  This is no different. He offered her PAID time off.  \n\nPeople working office jobs would have to use PTO.  It\u2019s the same thing.", "I would make sure the child is covered under her or her employer's insurance and not your homeowner's insurance.", "NTA - My meemaw\u2019s cleaning lady used to bring her kid over all the time and he wouldn\u2019t stop screaming, so I get it.", "NTA. I think it's very likely that her plan was to bring her son for every other cleaning appointment during the summer. So when you said no, she knew that you would not be okay with this plan. That would align with why she dumped you as a client right away and was so mad. You spoiled her plan to spend time with her son.\n\nI don't think this was a miscommunication.", "We don't know what her thought process was. But giving someone an asshole verdict for offering an employee a paid day off is ridiculous.\n\nAnd telling an employee she can bring her son in the future is granting her flexibility."]}
