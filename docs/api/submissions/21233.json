She's been coming to our apartment for roughly 3 months, once a week for 5 hours. She does her work, we pay her, and she leaves. Very few discussions. She likes to listen to her music whilst working, and my girlfriend and I work from home, so we are on calls or busy in general the whole day.\n\nLast week, 20 minutes before she was meant to arrive at ours, she sent me a text message saying her sitter cancelled at the last minute, and that she would be coming with her son. She didn't ask if she could, she just said 'Coming with him'.\n\nOur apartment isn't very large, it's open plan, with only 1 office space. I usually work from the living room, and my girlfriend from the office area, switching around depending on where the cleaner is currently cleaning.\n\nSo, I replied to her, mentioning that we had a lot of calls that day, that there was not any way her son could come with her (on such short notice), and that I understood her situation.\n\nHer son finished school last week (not sure if primary school or just a certain grade) but she was happy about it the week prior and told that she's looking to spend more time together with her son over the summer; so I responded to her saying I am more than happy for her to take these 5 hours and spend them with her son and that I would obviously still pay her for her time; that it's a treat for her son to celebrate finishing school (I was going to give her some extra cash for her son at the end of her shift anyways)\n\nShe replied saying she didn't want our money, and that she went to another house to clean as it's otherwise a waste of her time... I tried to ask her if we are still on for the same time next week and that from the following week I could organise the home a bit better so that if she ever needed to bring her son again, he could come with no issues (I could move my calls to another day so I could work from the bed, or find some other ways of arranging our work space)\n\nShe didn't respond for a few days, and then when I went to message her just now to confirm if she can come, she responded saying that she's sorry but she can't/won't return to work for us.\n\nSo, I'm looking for any way in which I could have come across as an Asshole which would explain her not wanting to return to work for us.\n\nSome thoughts I had were:\n\n1. She felt like a charity case because I wanted to pay her without letting her work\n2. She didn't like being told no to\n3. She misunderstood something I said completely\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nMy verdict so far is that it was a misunderstanding. That either I didn't make myself clear enough that I can make it work from the following week or she misunderstood when I said that and decided it wasn't worth the uncertainty long term.", "created_utc": 1688397168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14plry2/aita_for_telling_my_cleaner_she_cant_bring_her/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a parent, I get it but I also get that just because I am responsible for my child doesn\u2019t mean I get to impose that upon others. This is her work, not summer camp.", "NTA, you basically gave her a paid day off because her childcare fell through. You WFH and have a lot of calls and do not know this child. He might be quiet and would happily follow his mom around and read a book. Or he could be the spawn of satan who screams and breaks things. You just don't know. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA Normally I would say let a great cleaner bring her kid once in an emergency (well, unexpected lack of babysitting) but given that you work from home, I can see how this would not work for you. Your offer to pay her anyway was reasonable and generous, NTA.", "NTA!! At all!! She made a demand, not a request, and you said it wasn\u2019t possible. Then you offered her FREE MONEY and time with her son instead. How you react the way she did, I have no idea. \n\nMy only guess is that she was pissed that you said no to her. Simple as that. \n\nSo good riddance, you don\u2019t need a cleaner with such a bad attitude, and I\u2019m sure you can find another good cleaner easily who has a much better attitude.", "NTA. Whatever the miscommunication, you didn't make it and just like you were willing to extend grace to her she should've extended grace to you if she did feel some kind of way about how you responded. That said, you responded beyond appropriately. Even if you just said, \"no can't lets just pick another day\" would've been appropriate.", "NTA; however, did you say this to her:. ; \n\n(So I responded to her saying)\n\n     \"I am more than happy for her to take these 5 hours and spend them with her son and that I would obviously still pay her for her time; that it's a treat for her son to celebrate finishing school\" \n\n?", "NTA. You offered to give her money for no work and she declined it?! I might be a little offended that you assume the mere presence of my child will render your home unable to get work done in, but any annoyance I felt would be evaporated once you offered to still pay me. and it is YOUR home and work so you get to make that call. She got her feelings hurt a little and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees", "Nta. Your home is not a daycare. It's ridiculous for someone you are paying to come work for you in your home to just assume she could bring a child. You weren't upset with her and even offered to pay her without her working - which was very generous. I have no idea why she reacted like she did, but you are not at fault.", "NAH. She has a kid and has unexpected times come up, and it's likely your alternatives don't work with her, or that she wants clients who are more flexible. Your ask was reasonable, but it's also reasonable for her to decide you don't work as a client longterm.", "~~Soft YTA here sorry.~~ UPDATE: NTA - but you have to accept the decision they made.\n\nI've been at work where someone has had to bring their kid as their sitter cancelled. If the employer allows it (you in this story) its fine. Yes you have a decision but by saying no you are taking away her ability to earn money potentially. Yes they found another job to do and yes you offered to pay them back. But your lack of flexibility is something they picked up on and don't agree with. They are entitled to refuse to clean for you again.\n\nAlso from my experience kids who attend their parents work are almost always on their best behaviour. Had they acted out you could have asked them to leave politely which they would have understood more.\n\nThey informed you 20 minutes before but you gave them 20 minutes to find a new job that will pay her bills for the day.\n\nEDIT: Was wrong in thinking they had replied offering to pay for the day it was done all at once. Its a nice gesture to ensure you keep your standing appointment with them. They didn't take it well.", "NTA\n\nI think it was a simple misunderstanding. Maybe her response was meant as I didn't need the money as I just worked in a different location, so I was not out of pocket?", "My cleaner comes in a spray bottle.", "I'm gonna go with a soft YTA here. I'm assuming based on your post that she's never brought the son over before, so you really have no idea how it would have gone and you just assumed that it would be impossible for you to do your work while her son was there. I imagine that he simply would have gone where his mom goes, therefore the arrangement that you and your gf have to take your calls would not have been any different. \n\nI understand that it was an unknown variable and you never know how it could have gone -- but it sounds like you have a wonderful, professional cleaner that you had a great relationship with, who asked for a little bit of flexibility and empathy for one day, and you didn't grant her that.", "While you certainly did not need to agree to it and she should have asked instead of told you:\n\nI\u2019m curious as to why you weren\u2019t more curious before determining it would get in the way of you making calls. You don\u2019t know the son\u2019s age or temperament or anything, so what made you immediately sure it would be impossible? Maybe he\u2019s older and was going to be assisting her. Or maybe he could have just been playing on a tablet (with headphones on) in the kitchen or whichever room is not where you are. \n\nYou seemed to automatically assume he would be loud and disruptive, which may be true but also may not be true at all.\n\nAnd again, you are under no obligation to agree to it, but you claim she\u2019s the best cleaner YOU\u2019VE EVER HAD. That would be a situation, where I would be willing to at least consider accommodations by asking, follow-up questions, even if I were annoyed at the way, she brought it up initially. A good cleaner is hard to find, let alone a great one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The first time my cleaner didn't even ask me, she just showed up with her 2yo daughter who I ended up having to babysit so she could finish cleaning since the child wouldn't let her to do her job, she came in 1pm and left 8pm and I was furious. \n\nAnd then it happened a second time where she let me know when she was on her way, didn't ask too, just let me know and this time I refused to babysit the child, same thing, came in 1pm left at 8pm and the child was sobbing and screaming for the last 3 hours it's not even a joke, the situation was simply horrible and when she left I was feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nEven if all of this did not happen, I work from home, it is still my house and I get to pick who comes in. I am allowed (and so are you) to not want any kids here no matter what my motives are besides me working from home, and it is still her job and she needs to be professional about it, specially when her kid knows no boundaries and was screaming, grabbing, touching everything I own including annoying my cats.\n\nWhen I comunicated to her that she were not to let this happen again she seemed to feel a bit defensive, which I understand that she might have took it personally since it is her kid but there's nothing I can do about it, I'm setting a boundary and if you don't like it/agree with it there's nothing I can do. Since I understood there would be times where she wouldn't have anyone to look after her child I told her to let me know in advance so we could reschedule. She came in like maybe 3 times after that but I guess things were never the same after that.\n\nYou don't have to worry if you're the asshole or not, it's your house, your life, you make the rules and people don't have to like it. Don't feel bad about setting a boundary. Sometimes people will misunderstand us no matter how clearly we comunicate because they can't help it but take it personally.", "Is English her 1st language? I ask because candidly, the BEST cleaners I\u2019ve had don\u2019t speak great English and just know enough of the basics to do the job.

You unknowingly shut that down.", "thanks", "I think it's just the fact I said no, she gave no explanation either, or anything which is the most frustrating.", "Yes, i said that in pretty much those exact words.

It sucks to be disappointed in people, but maybe you dodged a bullet.", "So, I don't think you are the A, you are NtA. However, I can see how saying it like that which as a tear might not come across so well.

She may have had another job already lined up for that day that paid more or was more convenient or that already told her she could bring her son every week. You probably won\u2019t find out the reason, and there\u2019s probably nothing you could have done differently.

I think I may have been confused on this part. My apologise if I am.", "She only cleans 1 house/flat per day, and I offered to pay her for her time and to take that time and spend it with her son...", "yeh I get that, I also had this as one reason as it could come across to some people as the 'rich asshole' kind of thing to say (I'm not rich by any means, I just make slightly above average and gf makes average)", "Thats what i told her though, that from next week, I will organize my days better to be flexible in case she needs to bring him; either she can work on a different day on which I don't have calls, or if that doesn't work, I can shuffle things around (from the next week)... can't really reschedule 6 hours worth of calls the morning of the calls", "It was technically 3 separate messages, but on whatsapp, so i always break my messages into shorter texts.", "She may have this whole pride or work ethic thing getting in the way, that a privileged person wouldn\u2019t understand.", "the thing is, it's a long term issue. she's gonna have to bring her son occasionally now that school is out, and it seems like that's not something you'd be able to work with, and it's not like you'll pay her every time to not work. she realized the issue", "Yeah, I get that and again, I would be excited to get extra money; however, everyone takes it differently. I guess next time just don't say the treat part ... And/or if you hire someone with kids or other responsibilities (elderly relative etc.) I would just talk to them in a case like that, if they let you know for example xy hours in advance it's not a problem or otherwise you can reschedule etc.", "This is just my point, you weren't flexible enough for her to bring her son, and she picked up on that.  Her other employers will also have restrictions on which day she can work for them.  You didn't do anything wrong, but she hasn't either.", "As long as they were sent reasonably close together (within a minute or so) I'd say you are more in the clear but honestly consider that they do need to make a living. They probably saw the first, accepted another job instead of waiting for the 2nd and 3rd. It sounds like they may have had another job waiting. If shes just had her sitter cancelled likely going through a bit of stress making sure they have a way to keep easily entertained while they take them to work.", "Yeh,I can see this is as a potential reason. Difficult to navigate, how would you approach this situation if you wanted to just give someone a paid day off, or a xmas/easter/whatever bonus? Now I'm worried about offending people by being somewhat generous :/", "Not really long term issue, I messaged her that we can change her day to another when I don't have calls, or keep the same day and I'll move my calls (i'm fairly flexible but need more than 1 days notice).

This woman had a babysitter cancel last minute and tried to do what any parent would have to do, while earning a living for the day.", "You should have remembered that she is a business woman and treated your offer as a business transaction. You should have said something like: \u201cWe will have to cancel services for today as I was not prepared to have more than one additional person in the apartment. Since I am the one that\u2019s canceling at the last minute, I will compensate you for your time by paying your usual fee.\u201d You presented the offer like she was a damsel in distress instead of a professional cleaner.", "she's not always gonna be able to give you one days notice. ultimately, she's a mom, she needs clients that give her some flexibility around her son, and she realized you wouldn't be able to give her the flexibility she needs. it's a work incompatibility thing, and that's about it. so I'd go NAH, except for the fact that you seem to think she owes you?", "I mean, I personally wouldn't bring it up right away, in this situation, I would probably anyways test/try the person for two weeks (if you can work together essentially and if they clean good etc.) and usually you then learn some information about them or if it comes up even in the beginning. I mean usually you talk a bit I, so whenever they mention kids, I would probably be excited and say something positive. And then at some point especially if they are younger kids I would just mention it. Like, oh that's great that you have two kids, that's a great age what are their names? Whenever you need to pick them up or they are sick. And I mean kids are getting fast sick, just let us know etc.. I would just have a positive, relaxed conversation about it.", "I don't need a days notice always, but she never discussed this as a possibility with us in the past.

Good cleaners are precious, they getting passed between families and phones kept secret, lol. You were brave, I would not say no to my cleaner.\n\nNext cleaner figure out situation ahead of time, in order to keep best ones you need to be accepting certain emergencies like \u201c I will come cleaning with my sister today and will be done faster \u201c or \u201c have to bring child \u201c. Same with you- if your employer never allowed to go have dental appointment during the day, would you stay? Nope.", "NAH. Good housekeepers are hard to come by and she knows it too. Probably has a good waitlist or other clients she\u2019s willing to dump you for.  \n\nYou have a right to say no to her bringing her son.

Yes, housekeepers do fire their clients.", "NTA\n\nI feel like great employees can still be shitty parents. So you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting. You have no idea how well behaved the kid would be. \n\nYou have them a paid day off. That was literally the most generous solution. If it offended her, too bad. Your house, your rules. No sane person could object to getting paid for not working!!!", "NTA  you gave her a paid day off.  And she quit?", "Dude, I can\u2019t see a single thing you did wrong - you were even willing to let her bring her kid in the future.  What happened was entirely on her, coming from someplace you don\u2019t know about.\n\nSometimes crap happens and it\u2019s just out of our control.  How she reacted isn\u2019t something you could have anticipated, and most people would have been happy to have the time off.  Or worked for half pay the next 2 times, if it felt like charity.  Try not to be too hard on yourself.", "I agree and I think \u201cher sitter canceled\u201d means she really planned to bring him with her every time all summer.  NTA.", "she obviously doesn't need your business, you said she's really great so she probably has a wait list for clients an decided this was to much hassle", "So she seen \u201c no\u201d and moved house she cleans after you in schedule and they were happy to accept. \nIf you want to have the best cleaner you got to be flexible"]}
