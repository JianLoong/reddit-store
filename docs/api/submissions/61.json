However, my wife's mother passed this past Tuesday, and although we knew that cancer was making her very ill and that this say would soon come, my MIL death still shook my wife's world.

They did the usual \"awh, we wish you could both be here.\" But assured me that they understood and wished my wife healing.

That is a bizarre reaction from your mother. Has she acted like this on the past?", "NTA - I do wonder why the sudden switch up though. Maybe someone got in their heads. It seems like an extreme reaction to missing out on a party/dinner, even if it is their golden year.", "NTA. Since you say she has done this before, it\u2019s time for a teaching moment. Give her what she asked for (you and your family no part of her life) for a year. After she misses all of her grandkids\u2019 firsts (steps, words, etc.) maybe she will learn something.", "Ditch your wife and come celebrate the longevity of our marriage! The irony...\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all. Was your mom super drunk or something when she called? This story doesn\u2019t make sense. Or your mom gaslights you or something.", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nYour mom is seriously lacking in the compassion department if she thinks her anniversary dinner trumps your grieving wife, who is also nursing twins.\n\nYou made the right call.\n\nYour mom needs a swift attitude adjustment.", "NTA, I'm sorry for your loss. Your parents/mother's reaction doesn't really make sense to me and I'm wondering what happened on their end to explain such a change of reaction. Obviously a death in the family takes precedence over anything else and your duty to your wife is extremely important, so it seems weird to me that your parents would choose to add to your grief by treating you like this.\n\nIt strikes me as emotionally manipulative and straight up abusive. Have they done other things like this in the past? If so, you need to be careful...", "NTA\n\nFirstly my condolences to you and your wife. Losing a parent is so tough and she has a long road ahead of her. That on top of being a new mother? She must feel so overwhelmed. She's lucky to have a loving and supportive wife by her side as she grieves.\n\nYour mother is not only in the wrong, she is acting narcissistic, self absorbed and hurtful. Hurtful not just to her daughter in law, to you and to your wife's recently deceased mother. Does she have no respect or manners? That poor lady just passed away a few days ago and your mother is throwing a fit over a stupid dinner? It's so insensitive. When you experience the sudden death of a loved one it usually changes your perspective and make you realise that you shouldn't care about trivial matters. Neither you or your wife should have to deal with this right now. \n\nDon't let her get away with this behaviour. She deserves to have some manners put on her. If I were you I would distance myself from her. She doesn't seem to care at all about you or your wife's feelings. Even worse I think her behaviour is incredibly insulting to your deceased mother in law.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your wife has had a major loss at a time when she is likely still dealing with some level of hormonal baby blues - PPD and exhausted from caring for twins. She needs you by her side. Your mom was being selfish with her calls. You should probably let the emotions sit. Give some space, and then write to your mom informing her that while you love both she and your wife and children, this is not a competition of love. Your wife was in an extremely fragile state, and you had a responsibility toward her to make sure she was not alone and had the safety and support of you by her side.", "Your wife needed you on so many levels, not only do you have new born twin\u2019s which has made a major change to your life and routine she is recovering from birth on top.\n\nAdd to that her mother passed away less then a week ago, and she sounds like she was the constant for your wife and hoped her mother could be around to meet her grandchildren more.\n\nAt this time, she truly needed your support, as it not just about the emotional impact, but all legal and arrangements which need to be done that make grieving even harder.\n\nI get the reason why your parents might upset and wanted the whole family there, but wife needed to know that you are putting her first and she doesn\u2019t have hide or push through her feelings towards make others happy.\n\n\nThere will another opportunity to celebrate with your parents, they reaction feels slight selfish to me. You are no longer a kid, you have your adult life with its own responsibilities and priorities which are important to you.", "NTA. Your wife was devastated. You correctly prioritized in this situation. \n\nYour mom is being incredibly self-absorbed here.", "NTA. Your mom is being completely  ridiculous, she's lacking empathy, and her behavior is disgusting. You have a new family that takes priority. Your wife just gave birth to twins and lost her mother. Either life change alone could be overwhelming but she's dealing with both at the same time. Leaving your wife deep in grief to care for newborns alone would have been more egregious.", "NTA - you have your priorities straight... Wife & kids come first. They need your more than your parents do\n\n(Do you think your Mom was drinking?)", "NTA.\n\nYour wife and kids are your priority now as they are now your immediate family.  Everyone else comes after them.  You made the correct choice.\n\nYour mom is very misguided if she thinks that in the line of priority, she should be ahead of your wife.  And given that this was THEIR anniversary (albeit a nice dinner to celebrate it with everyone) it does not trump your wife having given birth and the loss of her mother days before the dinner.", "You did the right thing. I'm as confused as you are as to the change of heart on your mother's part.  It's a WEDDING anniversary, so really the celebration is between the two of your parent's and don't they want you to be a good spouse so you can celebrate your marriage 25 years down the road?  My condolences to your wife on her loss and Congratulations for your twins.  I would go NC with them for a while and focus on your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nOf course your wife comes first. It was all over your wedding vows.", "NTA your wife has gone through trauma.  It's one thing to have a parent die but slowly with cancer? Your mom is being highly insensitive.  In addition to brand new twins.", "NTA. Your priorities are aligned correctly imo. Partners and kids come first. Your mom can be bummed that you didn't make it but she is acting ridiculous.", "NTA, your wife just gave birth *to twins* and she also lost her mother. No one in the world would feel celebratory in that situation. Kudos to you for standing by your wife, the mother of your babies, the nucleus of your new family; as she grieves the loss of her mother while also learning how to be a mother herself. Stand firm against your mother\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty. Best of luck to you as you and your wife get through those first years with babies, parenting is hard but so rewarding. I\u2019m so sorry for your family\u2019s loss too.", "Nta- you did the right thing. Your wife needed you. Your parents, although will have missed you and wanted you there, did not NEED you in the same way. Please don\u2019t feel guilty, you 100% did the morally right thing here.", "NTA. Your wife should come first in this situation. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "Nta, im sorry for your guys loss. I wish your family well.\n\nYour mom reaction is completely weird and terrible. I don\u2019t understand how she could think her anniversary was more important than being there for your wife after dealing with her mom dying. Plus not only being that upset but to not want to be apart of not only your life but your children.", "NTA. If you mother expected you to leave your postpartum WITH TWINS grieving wife to go out to dinner, she\u2019s insane. You did the right thing. Let her stew in her own juice and don\u2019t give in to her manipulation.", "They're looking for attention. Tell them you love them but can't believe how little empathy they have for your wife. Let them know you're open to their apology but this is not acceptable and it's a good idea to see a family mediator asap. Don't let this to continue impacting the joy of your new babies and your wife's peace while she grieves.", "Oh I am so sorry, OP. This was awful behavior from your parents.You are definitely NTA. You did exactly what a good partner and parent does: you kept your wife and children safe and cherished when they needed you.\n\nIf this is unusual behavior for your parents, it's very strange. I hope that they will come to see how weird and destructive they're being. \n\nTill then, cuddle those babies, hold your wife. It's where you are meant to be.", "NTA I'm baffled that your parents think that their behavior is remotely ok.\nThis is truly a case of getting older rather than getting wiser. They are completely lacking empathy to think that you should be at their party instead of being with your grieving wife. Losing your mom so soon after giving birth must be horrific. So many feelings and regrets about the future that will never come to pass. \n\nI spent months in a tailspin, mourning my mother. I have a 2 month old who will never know her and some days, it crushes me.\n\n Your parents must live a charmed life to not be able to muster a tiny amount of empathy. If your mother truly cuts you both and your newborns, then she can regret her decision at her leisure.", "Out of curiosity when your parents heard that your wife lost her mother, what was their response? Were they supportive, did they call, bring over a meal, watch the babies, did they even bother to send a card, flowers?", "INFO:  Does your mom have meddling siblings and/or friends?  It seems to me that somebody got into her head at the party about you not being there.\n\nNTA", "NTA!! You have twin infants and your wife is grieving her mother who died a few DAYS ago. \n\nAlso, 25 years is only silver and not gold, that\u2019d be 50 years of marriage. They have so many more anniversaries ahead of them but your wife lost her only parent. If they can\u2019t show empathy in a situation like that and instead want to make you choose, they don\u2019t deserve to be part of your life. \n\nDoes your dad actually agree with your mom?", "NTA\n\nYour wife lost her mother and you just had twins. You are absolutely not the asshole for caring for your wife.", "Holy moly NTA. I cannot believe your folks seriously thought you and your wife could/would come after such a week. Y\u2019all can get dinner later. Thank you for taking care of your boo and your babies.", "You have said it very plainly; your wife is your priority, your children needed you. If parents want to suddenly start acting all hard done by (because of your brother or because they lack empathy or whatever) so be it. Step back, don\u2019t initiate contact, allow their tantrum to blow over or the realisation that you are quite content with your immediate family to hit them.\n\nNTA", "NTA and I'm sorry not only for your loss but this unnecessary drama on top of it", "NTA, your mom is a real selfish piece of work! Her DIL's mother just DIED! She doesn't think that's more important than a stupid party? \n\n(Also: 25 is silver, not gold. Just had mine but would skip it instantly if something like this happened!!)", "NTA: You so did the right thing. Your parents have each other and all the other guests - your wife and kids only have you. And this was just a dinner verses your wife losing her mother and your kids losing their grandmother - and you losing your MIL. How could your parents be so callous to all of you?\n\nBut if they're this quick to go NC with you, maybe you should.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for you and your wife\u2019s loss. Losing a mom is hard anytime, but so hard right after birth. You were of course going to be there for her and your babies. Honestly, you mom is acting absolutely horrible. She\u2019s lacking basic care and empathy and acting super spoiled and self-centered. I\u2019ll never understand people expecting others to come to an anniversary dinner. Anniversaries are for the couple celebrating, they aren\u2019t for other people, that\u2019s just super weird. And for those that wonder, I\u2019ll be celebrating my 25th anniversary in a couple of years and would never even invite my kids to our anniversary dinner, let alone expect them to show up after a tragedy (although one of my children will still be an actual child on my 25th anniversary, still won\u2019t be invited).", "NTA, your wife and kids are top billing. You\u2019re mom is upset because they had a major life event and wanted you there, but again, *your own wife and your own children* are your top priority in life, regardless of other dinner plans", "NTA and I seriously don\u2019t understand parents like this. The way I was raised, if I picked my parents over my chosen spouse, my parents would be absolutely pissed at me and would think they didn\u2019t do their job as a parent correctly. \n\nAlso, your wife is going through a lot right now. And frankly, OP, from your post your parents seem pretty distant and not really interested in a relationship with your wife or children in the first place. I know you love your parents, but if you don\u2019t start setting some boundaries now then this will only lead to more hurt in the future.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is a jerk.\n\nShe and your father will continue to be married. Your wife's mother is dead. Ended. No more. She just had twins. She has to nurse two babies. That by itself is hard, stressful. Your wife can so easily experience some sort of mental incident owing to her post-delivery condition and the extreme stress and grief she's feeling right now. \n\nYour mother is ridiculous if she is still being manipulated by your brother. She doesn't want to be in your or the kids' life? GOOD. Can't have some sympathy and compassion for your wife and mother of your kids? Then maybe she doesn't deserve to be in your family's life. \n\nKeep supporting your wife. Hope she heals well, mentally and physically.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA. Your wife and kids *should* be your priorities, that's just what happens once we grow up and create new families of our own. That doesn't mean that you don't care about your parents any more, but of course their party is going to come second to making sure your family is taken care of.", "You made absolutely the right call. Your mom is the AH for saying those things. \nShe is your wife and in addition to being a new mom which is super hard she just lost one of the most important people in her life. Shame on your mom.", "Could people please re-read the post and not refer to OP as \"he\"?", "NTA,  good on you for staying with your wife and children that's how you will make it to 25 years, priorities are your nuclear family from now on, extending family are down the list,  especially a party when your having a hell of a week with life. \nHubby and 1 22 years in, we spend our anniversary with each other, never got the idea of parting with other to celebrate our love. Enjoy your new family and big hugs on the lose of your MIL.", "Your wife just gave birth to twins and then her mom died and your mom is upset you missed a dinner?\n\nI'm sorry but unless she was drunk and immediately apologizes then I'm horrified at her complete callousness \n\nNTA you did the absolute right thing", "NTA. What you did was appropriate to the situation that you found yourself in. How were they expecting you to join for dinner is baffling.", "NTA. An immediate family members passing takes precedence over an anniversary dinner. Every. Time. Your mother can fuck right off with her insensitive temper tantrum. She should be glad she\u2019s alive to celebrate an anniversary, I\u2019m sure your wife would trade anything to have one more dinner with her mother.", "NTA Your priorities are perfectly aligned- your wife, her grief, and your infants are the most important things right now.

I wonder what changed\u2026", "NTA and yes, your wife and children will take precedent over your parents. You made vows to your wife which include to forsake all others. Those are part of the same vows your own parents took 25 years ago. I understand why your parents are upset but what your mom said was out of line. Your is still adjusting from giving birth and being a mother. On top of that emotional rollercoaster now she has to bury her mother. Condolences for your loss.", "NTA. Your mother sounds like a piece of work. Your wife will always come first, as will your children.

And you had the best reasons not to go. Why the fuck are they being nasty to you and your family instead of enjoying their event with those who can attend? It's such selfish, self-absorbed behavior. I would be livid at them for making a difficult time *more difficult*. What did they hope to accomplish? What exactly is their goal? Certainly not to have you and your family in contact with them, because they're just burning shit down for nothing.", "NTA. If my husband lost one of his parents, not only would my parents not expect me at their anniversary dinner, there\u2019s a huge chance they would cancel/reschedule it so they could support him.

When my dad died suddenly in 2020 I was absolutely devastated. I have in laws like your parents who complained my partner was spending too much time with me and putting all his eggs in one basket.

It it quite literally double of everything. Double the feeding, double the nappies etc. But more difficult is the logistics of twins, moving two newborn babies with no head control around the house is a challenge and leaving the house is even harder. Having to choose which crying newborn to tend to first is heart breaking and goes against all instincts. Having to learn how to feed two babies, with different latches or needs is challenging. Not being able to give your sole focus to one baby is guilt inducing. (It is also double the love, double the hugs, double the joy and amazingly wonderful) \n\nWhen my twins were 3 months old my sister was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, the added stress of a terminally ill family member just compounds all those overwhelming feelings. To then lose that loved one during that time I can't fathom. To have to grieve and  organise a funeral while caring for two newborns is so much for your wife to deal with. \n\nYou have done the right thing, your parents need to adjust their self focus, and realise that while it is sad that you both couldn't be there, what's sadder is their DIL losing her mother and their grandchildren losing their grandmother. \n\nPlease shield your wife from your mother during this time so that she can grieve and heal without the added unnecessary stress of your mother being ridiculously selfish. \n\nThanks for being a great partner for prioritising your family.

Oh you don't want to be in our lives? DONE.\n\nOh no wait...", "My grandpa was, when he had Alzheimers. Him having Alzheimers was hard but seeing my aunt manipulate him was *devastating.*", "I know people that are absolutely that impressionable. Sometimes it's also just the other person constantly saying something about it and it's like an ear worm.", "Over 20 years ago my aunt gave birth to her daughter (my cousin) and the next day went to her father's (my grandad) funeral. I cannot imagine the mixture of emotions she was going through at that time.", "I agree. 100%", "Thank you. I will fix that.", "Thank you very much for your kind words!  \n\nLol she and my FIL live close by now so we are often swapping dinners, and take turns hosting.  She is extremely loving and sees her other DIL & I as her daughters.  We are very lucky to have her and my FIL in our lives.", ">Based on your description of your brother, I'm guessing he's the Golden Child and you were always the Scapegoat/Peacekeeper?\n\nThis is my conclusion as well.", "Can't it be a middle ground depending on the situation? Now it's clear that the mom is in the wrong but it's also common to see a number of times were it's the spouse who is the AH and the saying would give place them in their corner.", "I mean. You plan your anniversary dinner/party around when your anniversary is. It's not their fault that's two months after their DIL gave birth. Sometimes timing is just unfortunate and you accept that it's not possible for everyone to attend.", "I agree with you 100% but just want to point out that OP is a woman.", "... it's an anniversary", "I thought this too, but went back and reread the story and she says she dropped their present off before the dinner, and they were fine. Why would she be dropping the present off if she was going to the dinner?", "Drunk was my first thought too", "I think that if OP\u2019s parents really valued her presence, they could have rescheduled. My best friend\u2019s mother in law just passed away. Her father\u2019s 60th birthday party was supposed to be that weekend and instead, they moved the event so that they both could be there for my friend and her husband. It\u2019s a little shocking to me that someone with such an unreasonable reaction could stay married for long. I think she was influenced by someone, and likely alcohol, as well.", "Op is a woman", "The wine talking was my first thought too, but why carry on the next day and the next odd", "My immediate thought, too. Had a cousin who talked his mother out of both his siblings' inheritances and got literally all her money and property. Tried to do the same with another relative. He died rich but extremely unmourned.", "Exactly,  that ALONE.", "Some people are just natural manipulators.", "It\u2019s been happening in my family since my older sibling was a small child. They tell our mom to do exactly what they want including giving them all their money", "My dad still won\u2019t use a microwave today because 20 years ago some asshole kid convinced him they make food carcinogenic. It\u2019s me, I\u2019m the kid.", "I have a feeling there's a good chance the kid is being used as an echo chamber and subsequent straw man in those situations.", "I'm glad she's in therapy and I'm assuming because she's seeking such out that you have already recognized the need to establish boundaries. My mother has a personality disorder so I was her bestie as long as we were doing things she liked and things were on her terms. Come to find out it was codependent lol", "That's good and congrats!", "Did he simply let it happen? None of it held your father's influence?", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re saying blind loyalty to a spouse. You should call out your spouse when they\u2019re the one being the jerk. But you\u2019re an adult and marriage comes before relationships with your parents. If your spouse is that terrible then you chose your spouse poorly. It doesn\u2019t give you freedom to be terrible and always expect back up.", "I agree. There is no way the spouse will always come first. What about if your dad dies, and you were meant to go on holiday for the weekend, I would have picked seeing and helping my mother over holidaying with my spouse.", "It can be, but can also be flexible. My parent's 25th is coming up, and they're doing a vow renewal. But I'm pregnant and my sister is getting married, so they're celebrating a bit early to accommodate that, because us being there and able to celebrate matters more to them than the specific date.", "Now that I checked that, it makes me wonder if not being biologically related is how they could write of being in their grandchildren's life. which sucks a lot.", "They might have said they'd be proud of their son because they have a son.", "Just wanted to remind that OP\u2019s female :)", "Because they didn't want to clutter up the restaurant with extra packages?\n\nOr there were other people around so they were putting on \"the good face\" in front of company?", "Yes I was just thinking my parents love my husband very much and they would absolutely not even want a party if he was fresh in grief. I\u2019m sure my ILs would be the same for me. It\u2019s shocking that they want an anniversary dinner to be bigger than a parent\u2019s death.", "\"Some people are just natural manipulators.\"\n\nI see you've met my sister.", "Are you saying that the mom learned the manipulation tactics from her teenage son?", "Unfortunately her reason why was because she\u2019s tired of the same issue with her own parents! She had a huge meltdown this summer because I no longer have the time to see her every day for 4+ hours and said I made her depressed and she couldn\u2019t stand how I was treating her. She wanted me to go back to being her therapist and didn\u2019t like when I said I couldn\u2019t.\n\nI actually didn\u2019t even realize how strange our relationship was until I talked to my own therapist a few years ago. But this year caused a few things that made me not talk to her daily during all of my free time and it\u2019s been very eye opening. I\u2019m sorry, it really sucks to realize that. I hope you\u2019re doing okay", "Thank you. This is exactly right. I don\u2019t know why that was interpreted as \u201clet your spouse be an asshole.\u201d", "Hopefully you can exercise nuance in decision making. But in the situation posed by OP, the needs of the grieving & newly postpartum spouse take precedence over any and every party.", "Priorities to our loved ones change with different situations. It\u2019s ridiculous to dictate priority to a spouse above all else simply because you got married.", "An entire vow renewal is very different than an anniversary dinner party.", "They *might* be blood-related.

And I am about 10 years past the first stage of realization and probably about 6 years past realizing that I had to grieve the mother she had always pretended to be so I am in great shape nowadays. I did end up moving a thousand miles away from her and am very very low contact but when you realize that the friendship is so conditional and step away you make room for friendships that don't come with those conditions and it is such a fulfilling change of pace. I really would have told you that I had a good life before but it was holding me back in so many ways. I hope you are as well, it sounds like you are still early in the journey and it is a rough one.", "I'm glad to hear you went to therapy. Seems like you went through parentification and needed to reparent yourself... because you were more of a parent than your mother was to you.", "Thank you, I\u2019d expect my partner or spouse to be the first one to call me out, even if I\u2019m being terrible to the partner or spouse. \n\nThere\u2019s nuance involved, but health of your spouse and minor children will take precedence over everything else. I\u2019m also not saying as an adult I won\u2019t ever have responsibilities to my parents or grandparents, and that would affect a relationship, but hopefully you chose your spouse well and they help you help your relatives.", "It can be (though this one isn't, it's literally just our immediate family) but the point is that if you want family to be at your event, you work with them as much as is reasonable.  Pushing a dinner back by a month so your DIL and daughter can be better adjusted after the recent birth of their twins seems pretty reasonable to me, if it is very important to you that they are able to come.", "Maybe.  Its not stated.  I just cant imagine someone being so easy to lose grand children because their daughter, who did everything else she could, missed the actual dinner for their anniversary.", "You said OP is a woman but the person you replied to didn't necessarily suggest otherwise.", "And the vile woman whom I have the great displeasure of acknowledging as the woman who birthed me", "Scapegoats unite!! High Five! (Erm, High Cloven Hoof??)", "Sarcasm on my part.

Parents could be 80% parents (realistically, no parent is 100%, as much as people would like), and manipulative children will still find a way. I\u2019ve seen it happen in my own family.", "Yes. I'm thoroughly convinced that personality disorders are what happens when you learn to use maladaptive methods to fulfill your needs or protect your peace successfully. Add in time and the practice of those maladaptive coping strategies digs one deeper and deeper into a misunderstanding about how to affect a healthy relationship. Lots of people think it's genetic, but I've seen it happen just as often with adopted children and bio (I've been in support groups for children of NPD parents for about 12 years now)", "No, they said \"I would be proud of MY son\", so while it's possible they missed the fact that the OP is a woman, it's also possible the person who wrote that has a son and no daughter, so they were relating it to their own personal circumstances.", "kinda weirded out by the concept of 'npd parents' and not 'abusive parents that also have npd' bc whew that sure makes it look like everyone w npd is an abuser.... when again its a trauma disorder"]}
