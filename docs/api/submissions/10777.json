She's trying to argue about getting their college paid for but is blowing their college funds. Wait she was pregnant at 19, 21, and 23. What pageants paid for her college? Most child pageants winners get $500 to $1,000. Was she doing adult ones in-between pregnancies? While in college? \n\nYou let your wife handle all your money and never check anything? What are you doing? Anyway, pull them out of these things and stop letting your wife blow insane amounts of money on them. Start education/life funds for your kids.\n\nYou're waiting for a six year old to approach you about this. Stop that. You are a parent. You need to proactively stop this before it harms your kids, if it hasn't already, and before it bankrupts you.", "ESH aside from the children. You are right but bloody hell you have let this get ridiculously out of hand already. Personally I think it's really fucking weird that these things exist - I'm from the UK and as far as I know such things do not exist here. But even aside from that, the money spent -I mean $100k?! I assume you must be enormously wealthy that you've already set aside college money for each, live in an amazing house with no mortgage, etc.", "Nta therapy asap", "NTA - set aside the bribing, living vicariously and spending a shit ton without telling you, one of the big issues here is that your daughters are not being given any choice. They are having an interest/hobby forced on them with no agency. Maybe one of them wants to do karate or ballet or skateboarding?   \n\n\nIf they choose to keep doing pageants then great but paying your kid to do keep doing something you want to do when they want to stop is coercive and removes your daughter's ability to willingly consent. Some people may think i am reaching here but there is a lot of research that shows if you let kids practice consent in all areas of life as they grow then they have a better understanding of boundaries and how to assert themselves when needed. Obviously this doesn't apply to all situations, kids need guidance and boundaries from parents/care givers, but this is a situation where it would be massively beneficial for your daughters to feel empowered to make their own decisions.   \n\n\nI'd put a fair chunk of money on at least one of your daughters becoming extremely resentful of your wife, and then probably your wife resenting them for not being grateful for all the \"support\" she has given them. I think it will do long term damage and probably cost you a fortune in therapy. Most mother daughter relationships struggle at times especially when the teenage years hit, your wife is setting herself up for a miserable time and you will also be miserable having to play peace keeper all the time.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

TBH, for $100 as a 6yo, I would do prettier much anything too. That is big money at that age! You may also want to talk to your wife about balance. Independence. Pageant life is about independence and scholarship to your wife? Let her know that the best way to raise strong and independent women is not with bribes and over coaching on speeches but enhancing their natural beauty and spirit so while you\u2019re happy to continue supporting the girls as long as they\u2019re happy in the pageants you will never really know if they\u2019re happy to do pageants or just want the money and togs and are afraid mom won\u2019t love them if they speak up?  \n\nAnd speaking frankly the scholarship aspect has always bugged me a bit because as someone in loads of loan debt despite having a 3.86 hr gpa and a 4.0 university gpa\u2026 the families that can spend $100k+ per year on pageantry don\u2019t need that money as much as kids who will never get it because they can\u2019t afford what it takes to win. \n\nI entered one pageant in my teens because of the scholarship promise and the moms were so cruel to me backstage for being the poor girl in simple makeup and a plain black dress that by the time I got on stage I was almost in tears. Pageants are tricky beasts that can strengthen your girls or turn them into bullies or turn them into puddles of self doubt who think very little of themselves and don\u2019t know how to think for themselves outside of the coached answers to questions\u2026 and if they\u2019re losing and sad about it then they\u2019re not the ones who will see the scholarship money anyway. \n\nIf you have that kind of money for pageants then you will probably be able to afford their tuition when the time comes - specially if you put that $100k/yr into a high yield savings account or college savings account instead\u2026.", "So would she do it without getting an American doll afterwards?", "Take them to a therapist  .

I was stating that she was barely an adult (if that) when she first got pregnant and has since been either pregnant or dealing with an infant or multiple infants. As such, she has never had the chance to be her own independent self, and that might (almost certainly does) have an impact on her behavior.\n\nAlso, with this further backstory we can now assume that you didn't know much about her family life or values before you became a couple? What is normal to her isn't normal to you? You may not have compatible values? That seems pretty relevant to the story.\n\nI personally don't like child beauty pageants.

I\u2019m not very familiar with the pageant world butI would suggest some couples therapy. I bet your wife is hanging into one thing she had before having kids sooo young and honestly barely got to grew up herself.

Plus she\u2019s been missing out on a crucial part of adult like and learning how to be independent.\n\nIt\u2019s not healthy and it\u2019s not teaching people to be humble at all.

My jaw dropped when I read that...each of your girls could have had a $25k college etc fund instead now.\n\nAll that said, this is obviously very important to your wife and confronting her about might not be the right approach.
