We live in a LCOL area but pretty much of all of us are minimum wage earners so we can\u2019t live by ourselves. My roommate \u201cTrent\u201d told us he was autistic when he moved in. We asked him if there was anything we should know about his condition to make sure he was okay, and he said pretty much not to engage with him unless he initiates it. He likes wearing his air pods a lot, and when he is at home he is glued to his phone or his pad with his buds in.   If we have to talk with him about anything we normally have to wait until he gets off his tech, so we normally just leave a note on the kitchen bench.  Once we interrupted when we were ordering Uber Eats and he seemed okay once he realised it was about take out.\n\nHe pays the rent on time and cleans up after himself so it\u2019s no big deal.  We all do our own thing. Anyways, he was walking slowly towards the door one day and was glued to his phone and had his air pods in and just stopped in the middle of the doorway. I was wanting to get by him because I needed to head to work and waited about 30 seconds with no sign he was moving. I put my hand on his forearm and said Hey, sorry I need to get by.\n\nHe turned around and looked at me and just blew up and went on like a minute about how dare I touch him, a lot of comments about me being overweight and that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t get past him and how I made him dirty by touching him. I just blinked and said \u2018look, just get out of the doorway I have to go to work.\u2019  Anyway, I was really surprised about how angry he was, but a lot of his comments seemed to be about my being a big woman and someone like me shouldn\u2019t be touching someone like him. He moved and I got by and just got on with my day.\n\nSo it seems he complained to my other roomies about it. One is saying AITA, I should have just waved my hand in front of the phone so he knew I was there. It didn\u2019t occur for me to do this tbh, but I don\u2019t think I am an AH for not thinking of this. The other is saying Trent is being a bit precious about it all, and probably wouldn\u2019t have been so snotty about it if I had been a VS model. Lol. It\u2019s no big deal for me emotionally, it\u2019s going to blow over, but AITA for touching him to get him to move?", "created_utc": 1668334317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytxioy/aita_for_touching_my_autistic_roommate_to_get_him/", "score": 563, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trent blew it way out of proportion; he could have just mentioned that you could have tried to get his attention it a better way while moving, that would have been fine. He became the asshole when he blew up and started insulting you like that.

He has to learn not to do it autism or not.", "Nta. I can see Trent's reaction, unfortunately autism is a big thing and a lot of people with autism have an issue with cleanliness and unfortunately aren't good at regulating emotions.\n\nHowever, he was blocking a door way and was being inconsiderate of others. You already apologised id leave it at that. \n\nNext time probably wave at in his face but he'll probably be upset with that because it's still an invasion of personal space.\n\nI guess it'd be a case of compromising that he needs to be more aware of his surroundings and ask what would be the best way to get his attention in the future in this situation.\n\nIf it's a common doorway, maybe have that discussion that if he doesn't want you touching him, then he needs to not stand in a doorway blocking other people from using it.\n\nAs said, ask him what he would find appropriate action to get his attention. If he's okay with you moving your hand in front of him, then is upset if you do that, you can be like well you said you were ok with that if I needed to get your attention. \n\nIt's definitely not okay how he spoke to you and I would set the boundary that he cannot talk to you in that way, personally for me that would be grounds for eviction and I would tell him the consequence if it happens again.\n\nAutism as many people had said is not a get out of jail for free card and that he cannot talk to people that way consequence free.\n\nI would discuss that with the other 2 room mates, as far as I am concerned how he spoke to you is worse then you touching him and he needs to learn if it happens again it'll be grounds for eviction but you need to have that conversation with the other 2 room mates to agree with a consequence if he talks to people like that.", "My autistic sister read this and she says he's a massive fucking asshole.

Being autistic gives you difficulty with social cues and sensory issues. It does not make you insult people. It does not make you intentionally hurtful in your language.\n\nTrent was upset because you crossed a previously set boundary regarding his sensory issues. But he absolutely did not have to react the way he did. So ESH.", "NTA. Being autistic is not a license to be a huge asshole.", "NTA bud.", "NTA. Maybe you shouldn't have touched him but that doesn't give him the right to say horrible things to him. I get that maybe he had a meltdown but that doesn't have to involve bring cruel.", "NTA and it's really crappy that you've normalised being disrespected in such a dehumanising manner. Autism or not, he doesn't get free reign to demean people. Imagine if you had returned fire and spoke about his condition. Honestly, only one of your roommates is decent and you should make it clear to them as well that it was offensive, the reasoning behind it and that you expect an apology.", "Nta\n\nMy eldest (18m) is autistic. He cannot handle being touched  he would blow up too. The difference is he tells people and you did ask your room mate if there was anything they should be aware of and theu didn't mention it. My son always says having a LD doesn't give you the right to be an arse", "NTA. He is though.  He needs to apologize.  He insulted you and I wonder if he has an issue with women.", "NTA for the same reasons everyone has already said. Autism isn't an excuse for sexism and fatphobia. But since he's always on his phone maybe you could text him if you need to get his attention?

It\u2019s not a get out of jail free card. It\u2019s a \u201cthe world affects me differently so sometimes I have different needs from a neurotypical person\u201d card. He doesn\u2019t have the right to lash out at you about your weight or anything else that doesn\u2019t have to do with the fact that you\u2019re touching him when he doesn\u2019t want to be touched (for a fairly good reason tho).", "[deleted]", "NTA.

It's quite common with ASD to have issues with touching others and personal space. If he hasn't mentioned this then it's understandable you didn't know. \n\nI would personally say I would have maybe tried stomping behind him so he could maybe feel the vibration and check his surroundings, or maybe clap or wave a hand around to get his attention without touching him.\n\nThat being said, he appears sufficient and aware enough based on what else you've mentioned to know that standing in the middle of a doorway with headphones in, when you live with others isn't the greatest choice.\n\nWhile I understand his reaction and that he is upset, it was inappropriate to react like that. While living independently, I would hope he is still receiving some kind of assistance to help him with his behaviours and to learn appropriate vs inappropriate responses and implementing techniques to adapt.\n\nIf he calls you all kinds of horrible names and offends you so personally for one minor incident, he doesn't sound ready to live with others, I worry about how he acts in other situations.\n\nHe sounds like he doesn't cope well with triggering factors, and definitely needs help with that, since if he will blow up from that type of interaction, you can imagine how badly things could go in worse situations. \n\nIn your circumstances, I can imagine living with him would be very stressful, since you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells around him and worried about another episode.", "NTA it\u2019s sweet of you to care so much about his feelings, but you need to care about your own as well. I know you say that insults like that roll right off you, but you still don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to you like that in your home or on the way to work, or anywhere. People with autism appreciate directness, is what I\u2019ve read from this website. If I were you, I would write him a note and say that standing in the doorway so other people can\u2019t get through is rude and unacceptable. Write that the words that he said to you are hateful, cruel, completely unwarranted, and you are angry that he blocked the doorway and then yelled at you in that way. Write that you deserve an apology for his bullying behavior. Autistic or not, he is the one that caused this situation. You don\u2019t need to be tap dancing around his feelings here, he needs to be made aware that he behaved unacceptably in more than one way.", "I wasn't going to apologize as things are pretty much back to normal.  He just needs not to stop in the middle of doorways.  I was a bit surprised at the fire in him but he's gone back to not really making eye contact with anyone or talking unless he wants something.  I was surprised he had spoken to the other two roomies about it.", "I've heard a lot worse than what Trent said, pretty much on a daily basis as I walk to public transport.   Water off a duck's back.  Tbf he's a pretty awesome roomie - cleans up after himself, doesn't stiff you on the rent and no drugs or loud music.", "[removed]", "This right here.", "The other roomies are cool.  One said I was the AH for not doing the hand waving, but it just didn't occur to me.  Trent also doesn't like that but calms down pretty much immediately when the others have interrupted him in the past.  I was just surprised about how angry he was with me as opposed to the guys.  His comments were pretty nasty about if I wasn't such a fat pig I could have gotten past, now he has to wash himself where I touched him with my dirty greasy hands etc.   He just seems back to his normal self again tho.  Still waters run deep.", "Yeah, it just didn't occur to me.  I just gently touched his forearm.", "I didn't actually apologize to him, just told him to move after he paused in yelling at me.  The problem is that you can't actually interrupt him to have a conversation without him getting snippy.   I suppose I could leave a note on the counter asking him how to communicate if he is in the doorway again, but it seems like this isn't an issue any more.   I'm not worried about him yelling at me for being overweight, I get that pretty much every day from strangers on the street and it's water off a duck's back.", "Lol.  Thanks Moonydog55 sister.", "thanks.", "Yeah, there's no answer for that.", "Yep, I'll try the hand waving in future if anything comes up again.   \n He really doesn't like any interruptions.  The other guys have interrupted him but this is probably the first time I have.", "We're all good.  I've heard worse before.  Next time (hopefully there won't be one) I'll just wave my hands, but I am hoping he will stay out of doorways in future lol.", "Lol, no.  Hopefully he'll pick better places to zone out in future.", "Yeah, it didn't occur me to do this, so I'll own that.  Having said that, he doesn't like any interruptions.  Like that time we got take out and the other roomie sorta snapped his fingers close to Trent's face and said 'hey, take out time what do you want'.  Trent was a bit snippy at first but calmed down pretty much straight away when he realised it was about food.   I don't do finger snapping in people's faces tho.", "Thanks isitpurple son.  Trent never actually told us what to do if something is urgent.  We never asked him to be fair.  He doesn't like to talk too much.  The other guys have interrupted him before and he's not liked it but gotten over it quickly.  It's just my situation where he went nuclear.", "I don't know if he has an issue with women.  Every now and then you'll notice what he's looking at on his pad and I think he likes looking at pretty girls like most young men.", "Hey yeah.  This is a good idea.   I don't think any of us have tried that.  He might still not like it as he just wants to do his thing without any interruption at all, but at least he wouldn't get startled.", "The intensity of reaction may be to do with the autism, where sometimes people have a very full-on aversion to touch, especially unexpected. (So maybe being a vs model would have made no difference to that part)\n\nHowever the *content* of the reaction - the wildly out of line insults, the blaming you, whatever's going on with the weight bs - well there's no excuse at all for that.\n\nAnd if Trent has sensory sensitivities that are going to trigger ragey reactions, he should warn you about those and how to avoid them, so no, you're NTA for not thinking to find a different workaround for this.", "He\u2019s a great roommate except for the sexist verbal abuse", "Yeah, there's no answer to that.  Even if I had just waved my hand it would have been interacting/interrupting him.", "Maybe they are cool otherwise, but calling you an AH for not waving your hand is kind of AH-ey, particularly when you weren't even touching him in a rude way; they're basically saying it's your own fault that Trent insulted you so badly. And Trent's comments weren't just pretty nasty, they were *incredibly* nasty and outright disrespectful. He needs to apologise for how he handled things.", "I would have shoved him if he spoke in such a disgusting way.  You don\u2019t deserve that from anyone", "Well it is a learning process next time you may put your hand infront of him instead of touching him but he also has to make sure nobody is behind him when he just stops and blocks a way . if he is outside and he blocks a way he will also be touched , if he can't stand being touched he has to make sure ppl can pass by without touching him. Imporvements can be make but it is not your fault since you didn't grow up around him and had no time to know everything and how to handle every single situation .", "So he has an issue with bigger women? Why bring it up if he doesn't? Why not snap at the male roommates?", "I really hope it helps. Also ask him if there's any other ways to get his attention that he would be comfortable with (or at least feels better equipped to tolerate than unexpected physical touch) if he's on a tablet or something rather than his phone.\n\nI also hope he apologizes for his comments, I'm autistic myself and have meltdowns like that, but that's never compelled me to be cruel and degrade someone for an unexpected trigger. That sounds like something that can become an issue again in the future.", "Yeah, like we have had to interrupt him once or twice before.  He doesn't like it, but I've never seen such a reaction - he probably said more to me in that minute or so than all the time we have rented together.    It's probably the first time I have had to get his attention.  The other times it's been the other guys asking him if he want to order some take out or  something else I can't recall.  He gets irritated but seems to calm down in a few seconds", "Yep, this exactly.\n\nAutism can make someone kind of melt down when unexpected or unwanted physical contact happens,   but it doesn't make someone start spewing utter nastiness and hateful words at you. \n\nHe spewed what he was thinking -  and the stuff he thinks is due to his specific personality..  not the autism.\n\nI'm autistic and although i can be uncomfortable with unexpected touch - i'd never even think any of that stuff,  let alone actually say it.\n\nAt worst i'd be a bit moody,  move away and tell you not to touch me.   Then later on i'd feel bad for saying that in the way i did and apologise to you.\n\nThe lack of remorse and apology from him is concerning.", "Haha yeah.  That sounds bad but you get sick of roomies stealing your food and trashing the kitchen and not cleaning up after themselves and always being late or trying to stiff you on rent.  Trent is pretty clean, he's quiet, he pays his rent and his share of the utilities without arguing.    He doesn't steal your food and he doesn't try and steal things out your room.  I get a lot of hate being a big woman.  Like I said earlier, I walk to public transport and I get yelled at / abused pretty much daily, and I work front facing customer service so  I've pretty much heard it all before.   He's entitled to his opinion and apart from this incident he keeps it to himself.", "It's not really their problem though.  For all I know they think the same way about me. As long as they keep their opinions to themselves we are all good.   We've finally got a good living situation where we don't have to worry about thieving or having to work extra shifts to cover the rent cos someone has dipped out.   I'm not rocking the boat or cutting my nose off to spite my face just cos someone thinks I'm a fat pig.  Join the queue.", "Probably because they are not big women?   Apart from this incident he's basically never really interacted with me in any meaningful way.  We are pretty much back to where we were before this.  Trent can hate on big women as much as he likes - if he continues to keep it to himself then we are all good.  I get what you're saying.", "I\u2019m very confused why you\u2019re defending them so hard when they aren\u2019t doing the same for you? Your roomies can be perfectly livable roommates and still be assholes in this instance", "I'm sorry that happened though.  Sounds like you are taking it like a trooper.  I would have lost my mind on him.", "I know being autistic isn't an excuse for being an asshole, but on the side of the autistic person here, I just wanted to say sometimes things can happen that are extremely upsetting and cause bad reactions like what your roommate did. \n\nIt sucks so bad, I really hope he can figure out better ways to manage the overwhelm and distress from situations like this. \n\nYou sound like you're being really kind and thoughtful about this whole thing. NTA at all!", "I can't say you're an AH but you do need to approach an autistic person very carefully. He seems to be on the lower end of the spectrum but he may be the type that is sensitive to touch or physical contact in general. Autistic individuals can be full functioning adults but it doesn't mean their disability is any less severe. Perhaps just keep in mind there are plenty of non physical n ways to get his attention. You could have texted him or called him too.\n\nNot an AH. Just be more mindful", "I really hate being unexpectedly touched, but it makes me shriek and hyperventilate, not *checks notes* start with the personal verbal abuse. That's not a neurodivergent thing, that's a Trent Is An Asshole thing.", "NTA.\n\nWow, what a shock. Another person using their identity to be a dick without a care for how much harder it makes life for people experiencing genuine difficulty.", "Nta, he's blocking because he's inconsiderate. Unreasonable to expect you to just wait untill he deigns to sod off.\n\nAnd his comments were wildly hyucked up.", "NTA\n\nTrent is the problem roommate, not you. \n\nYes, you touched him when there were other options. (Personally, I would have got as uncomfortably close as possible and yelled).\n\nBut he was blocking your access to the building and you NEEDED him to move. \n\nHe then started spouting some absolutely toxic, sexist, discriminatory bullshit.", "NTA, Trent is gross. I hate him.", "soft YBTA. \n\nI'm autistic and he likely blew up because the sensation of you touching him when he didn't expect it overwhelmed him. Touching autistics when we don't want to be touched, especially unexpectedly, will almost always result in an intense reaction that we cannot control. \n\nI do think he's an asshole for mentioning your weight, though, because that isn't relevant to sensory overload or you touching him. He also should have apologized for that after he calmed down.", "Absolutely NTA, \n\nAlthough it can certainly be startling and uncomfortable to be touched with autism when you aren\u2019t expecting it. The insulting language he used was unacceptable, you don\u2019t want to walking on eggshells around him. \n\nHe also needs to apologise afterwards which autistic people can find hard how to initiate or scared of your response. It might be easier if you told him next time. \u201cI\u2019m aware I startled you and I apologise for making you uncomfortable but I needed to get to work. I didn\u2019t appreciate ___, I\u2019d really appreciate an apology when you\u2019re ready.\u201d", "I work with many complex disabilities including autism, I have worked with many people with autism who display behaviours when someone touches them unexpectedly. Sometimes it can just be a reaction to being touched because they don't like it, the same way some people with autism don't like eye contact, sometimes it can be down to sensory sensitivities just like some people with autism hate certain fabrics on their skin. \n\nThat being said, just because he is autistic does not give him any right to insult, blame and make nasty comments especially as he has mental capacity and may understand what he has said. \nTo me, this needs to be addressed and have boundaries set for everyone. You need to sit with everyone and discuss what you all need to do if he is in the way, you need to talk to him and explain it is not okay to stand in a doorway and why - I normally say 'it is not acceptable to stand in the doorway as it is a exit route incase of an emergency' and make it clear that his behaviour was not okay.", "NTA. He is being precious? No lol. Just because you're autistic does not entitle you to insult someone like he did. He stopped in the middle of the hallway and then blew up on you without even taking in the fact he was holding everybody up.\n\nHonestly I'd be questioning living with an ass like that.when you're autistic you know you have these ticks, it's not something you aren't unaware of, so his comments did NOT simply come from that. It came from somewhere else and it's disgusting and sounds heavily mysoginistic.", "NTA being autistic doesn't mean he can be inconsiderate and obstruct door ways.", "I'm Autistic, neither of you are the asshole. He responded how his mental state responds to things he dislikes, he could also have trauma responses. I was abused physically and other ways as a child, when someone puts their hands on me without my consent I jump up, or I smack. I'm not saying my Autism is a \"get out of jail free card\" but definitely try to respect someone's wishes as much as possible. From now on try waving your hand in front of his face, that's how people get my attention if I'm preoccupied and I laugh it off and move or do what is asked of me.", "ESH, you more than him.\n\nPersonally, I think if you decide to touch someone without their consent, you don't get to say anything about their reaction. Frankly I'm impressed his only reaction was verbal and he didnt slap you or shove you across the room. \n\nHe's a bit of an asshole for the things he said, but its also clearly a reaction, not a response. When he's in control of himself he's never said those things. You made the choice to assault him, he reacted. Now you're upset bc you don't like the consequences of your actions.", "NTA he makes a better wall than a door", "He needs to be accountable for some of his own adjustments too. If he needs to not be interrupted and have his air pods in so he can't hear people, then he also needs to make sure he's not standing in the way of people trying to go to work.\n\nHe absolutely owes you an apology for what he said - just coz he's autistic doesn't mean he's not also a sexist AH. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nI have a friend who has high-functioning autism and can sometimes be sensitive about being touched, but he be such an AH over something so small and normal. Being bothered is understandable, freaking out on the person is not. If you are mature enough to move out of your parents\u2019 house and live with roommates, you are mature enough to handle this.", "NTA and autism(or any mental disorders for that matter) is no excuse to be an asshole. He could be a bit shocked and twitch a bit but not insult you like how he did.", "Nta being autistic isn't an excuse to.treat other ppl like crap", "NTA", "NTA. His comments are completely out of bounds. \nI do think, in the interest of keeping the peace in the future, it's worth asking him how he would like to be notified in the future when he's standing in the way like a piece of furniture.", "Nope NTA your roommate needs to learn that him bring austic doesng mean he is allowed to be a AH. \nAnd who blocks doorways anyways?", "NTA. He would have to find somewhere else to live after talking to me like that.", "If he can\u2019t hear he should be out in communal spaces where he might need to be engaged if he also can\u2019t be touched. And he shouldn\u2019t be snapping on anyone. If he can\u2019t act like a civilized person he\u2019s an issue and needs to go. He 100% owes you an apology and a reminder that autism doesn\u2019t = asshole and if he continues to treat you badly it\u2019ll be an issue.", "NTA he's ta", "NTA", "NTA & you're better than I am bc Autistic or not I would have knocked him clean out. Period. Extreme reactions not being the issue, but hurling such insults? No way dude. He needs to figure out how to deal with that whether it be have a strict no touch rule clarified beforehand, live alone or with people who agree to tolerate that abuse, idk but that is so not okay.", "Next time donkey kick his autistic ass out the doorway. NTA", "NTA. Autistic people are not assholes to others\u2026your roommate is", "NTA. But why are you on here defending him? Like what? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he is in the wrong. Just because he\u2019s autistic doesn\u2019t mean he can be an AH. \nDon\u2019t have much to say since I\u2019ve seen you repeatedly defended his words/action towards you by saying he\u2019s a wonderful roommate, clean and pays rent on time. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong but god damn, you\u2019re letting him get away with being a AH. I don\u2019t get it but keep on defending him. I\u2019m a bigger woman myself and I couldn\u2019t imagine letting A ROOMMATE talking to me like that, don\u2019t let people treat you less.", "NTA at all. Autism can not be used as a crutch to be nasty and hateful to people. I totally get having sensory issues and hating being touched or bothered but what he did there was straight up use Autism as his excuse to be mean. He owes you the apology \n\nMy nephew,my cousin, and best friend are autistic. So I've experienced alot of different behaviors with this.And none would I ever tolerate them being rude to me ever.", "NTA.\n\nI have an autistic spouse and sibling, and lemme tell ya, that's not autism. That's just pure assholery. You've been wonderful and have bent over backwards for this guy, and he screams at you for needing to go to work? Also, there's a giant difference between \"you touched me, I'm uncomfortable\" and \"you touched me, so I'm going to scream and insult you for a good long while\". \n\nThis roommate needs walking papers if he's going to do that to you.", "NTA. Sounds like your roommate is using his diagnoses as a way to be an ass", "NTA If possible, kick this a-hole out of the house. He verbally attacked you and me personally would not feel safe living around a person like that. His behaviour is not okay!! His words are not okay!! Don't even think about you are the a-hole, you are a normal human being who needed to pass. Autism or not, this is unacceptable.", "NTA. Being autistic isn't a licence to be an abusive asshole.", "NTA.  Trent needs a reality check.  Just because you're autistic doesn't mean you can be an AH without consequences.  Sorry, but unless he gives you a heartfelt apology for his outburst, his 'needs' would no longer be a priority.  If he can't be respectful and understanding to you, why should you be required to do that for him.  Make yourself VERY CLEAR when you see him next time that his outburst was mean and unappreciated and unless he follows through with a genuine apology, you will no longer be able to accommodate his wishes.  His choice.", "NTA and if anything he should be apologizing to you for the content of what he said. Having a disability of any kind, autism included does not entitle someone to be an ass", "NTA id call him out and tell him his autism isnt an axcuse", "Coming from someone with Autism, it is not a free pass to be a jerk and make such comments. Not to get too much into it but, the way he reacted reminded me of my friend who has severe OCD. She can only have certain people touch her and if someone she deems as \"unclean\" touches a thing of hers, she flips out. Im not trying to slap on another diagnosis but it's something to possibly consider. NTA", "NTA. Trent is. Autistic or not, he doesn\u2019t get to clog thruways in the house.", "As an autistic person myself I can confirm this.", "I bet on the flipside, if Chris-Chan was the autistic roommate, he would've revelled in that touch", "Thanks.  I don't really care about his feelings towards me as long as he keeps them to himself.", "Also Trent needs to give you a way to catch his attention. \"Don't touch me; wave a hand in my field of vision\". He can't just expect never to be bothered no matter how much space he's taking up or where.", "Thanks.  He's a good roomie overall and it's taken ages to find someone who isn't an addict/thief/liar.", "I'm not sure.   Tbh there's a lot of people who feel the same way about big women.", "Wack him with a broom stick upside his head since he\u2019s literal trash is the only actual answer here. Nothing he did to her was ok.", "It's not stressful tbh.  I've dealt with much, much worse.  He holds down full time work, and on the whole has been a good roomie.  I don't think he has any support workers or assistance.   I'm not moving out over one incident.", "You really think he was entitled to slap or shove me for gently touching his forearm?  Lol maybe I should have called the police as he was holding me hostage by blocking the door.  It's a long bow to draw. \n I'm not upset at what he said, I've heard it all before.  No worries, thanks for the feedback.", "What a bizarre and slightly concerning response.", "Thanks.", "Trent does, lol !", "But you shouldn\u2019t be getting that from someone you live with it\u2019s not okay. Even if it happens to you all the time it\u2019s still not okay. You don\u2019t deserve to be called those names. \n\nAnd you should definitely write a note to him or something saying that he can\u2019t speak to you like that. This isn\u2019t causing more issues it\u2019s fixing a problem that he started", "This guy is dangerously indoctrinated, as so many autistic men are, by misogynistic extremists. He calms down quickly and does ok with your roommates because they are men. I would be VERY wary and cautious with him. I get that he doesn't do some of the really annoying roommate stuff, but it is very clear he's into the spaces that encourage justifying violence against women. It's a really massive pervasive problem in the autistic community. We avoid these guys, too. Just watch your back.", "Idk man, doesn't sound like a bad idea. Get like a big walking stick or something, you can call it the Trent stick. Give him a little poke, or just tap it a few times front of him to get his attention when he doesn't have headphones In.", "Pretty women are objects he's attracted to, that have use to him. They are objects he wants to use, but still objects. You are an object he does not desire. To him, you're literal trash. Desiring other objects and being attracted to women is a LONG way from not having an issue with women. Autistic people are very prone to indoctrination, and for autistic men, this most often leads to extreme misogyny. Being autistic is very hard in this world - so autistics who have an axis of privilege often lean HARD into that, white autistic men are the worst, and extremely likely to be racist misogynistic hate fiends, essentially trying to hate other people more than the world hates them, clinging to the ways they are privileged to escape the ways they are marginalized. Honestly far too common in all kinds of marginalized men to conpensate by hating women, but much more so with the nature of autism creating vulnerability to indoctrination, with the rise of MGTOW. Just... be on guard with him. The kinds of indoctrination that leads to the things he lashed out with advocates for much worse things than name calling, and Wil actively tell him that having to share space with an abject he does not desire is the worst, most horrific thing, an attack on his person, and that it is justifiable to remove such trash from existence. Seriously, this guy could be one online echo chamber away from much, much worse the next time you look at him wrong.", "I understand, but now you see that he feels free to not keep them to himself. And, if you want to be compassionate and helpful towards him, which it sounds like you do, teaching him that blowing up at someone like this is unacceptable before he does it to the wrong stranger in public and gets himself in big trouble.", "He can't be a roommate, and stand in people's doorways, and not be bothered. That's just not possible. I believe he is not too stupid to realize the problem here- if he was, he wouldn't be living on his own dime and his own care.", "Yeah that's true.  I'd like to have everything on my own terms but that not how life works.", "Even if you want to keep him as a roommate, you need to stand up for yourself. Yeah sure, you won't feel SAD about it, but you absolutely should respect yourself too much to think that's OK behavior. Let him know he's wrong. He's not a good human, and that matters. That should matter.", "\u201cIt\u2019s taken ages to find someone who isn\u2019t an addict/thief/liar.\u201d\n\nThis is painfully relatable, in a perfect world living with other people would always be pleasant I guess. You have a good outlook so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be ok but damn, I\u2019m sorry you had to have someone insult you. You didn\u2019t deserve that.", "Are you accusing him of fatphobia for standing in the door? No.\n\nShould he be trotting out his identity to defend his right to be rude? No.\n\nSimple. Be normal.", "Don't get me wrong, not suggesting you move out over it. When you say you've dealt with far worse, do you mean from him? Or just in general?", "NTA, and that person's response is bizarre, concerning, and completely over the top.  They characterized you touching your roommate as \"assault\". It's nowhere near assault or battery from either a dictionary or legal perspective.", "I don't like people like that. I had a person like I used to work with. Pulled that stunt all the time", "What did he say that was sexist?", "Where the accountability for him learning how to live with humans and treat them with respect?", "I don't expect an apology and I'm not apologizing either.  It'll be water under the bridge soon.  This was hopefully a one off and I'd be surprised if he stood in the doorway again.", "Trent or me?", "Not from Trent, just daily abuse when walking to PT and sometimes at work.  I have more detail in some of my other responses.", "Straight up, I would tell him that if he doesn\u2019t have a solution to getting his attention in situations like these, then ur just gonna be carrying a loud ass air horn around with u, for whenever u need his attention", "He actually isn\u2019t entitled to an opinion about your body in any way shape or form. And just because you\u2019re used to abuse doesn\u2019t mean some abusive asshole should be in your home continuing the cycle.", "Seriously? Calling a woman a fat disgusting cow is very clearly misogynistic bullshit. The entire rant, all the points relayed to us, are clearly dripping with misogyny and the idea that women only have value in terms of a man's attraction to them. He doesn't even seem to see her as a person, merely an object hexs not attracted to (as opposed to other women, who are objects he is attracted to). The fact that he expressed issue with someone disgusting like her making him unclean, rather than tactile defensiveness to touch, is very telling (as an autistic, trust me, this is not a normal sensory defensiveness). This is unfortunately VERY common with autistic men, as the juxtaposition of autistic vulnerability to indoctrination with male privilege leads SO many of them to be absolutely rabid red pill/MGTOW/incels.", "OP. Just, no. I have to wonder the same as pvpercrown. Why are you so bent on defending them when they're being wrong. They might be decent roommates and people (which doesn't sound like it's at least completely the case, judging by the misogyny), but even decent people can do bad things or behave like assholes. They might not be thieves that bail on bills but in this matter they are simply wrong.", "Him, but given the nature of this conflict, you and everyone you know could stand to hear it more.", "He is entitled to an opinion on anything in the universe, including other people's bodies, because we can't, and shouldn't, police the content of one's mind. What he isn't entitled to is expressing those opinions without consequences.", "Icl When I used to be fat I was called a fat disgusting pig many times, I had women look at me with disgust or opt to stand on a train if I sat next to them, even when I wasn\u2019t touching them at all. Fat phobia and disdain for fat people isn\u2019t unique to women, in fact modern media is much more accepting of fat women than fat men.", "Because she\u2019s used to thinking badly about herself because everyone excuses it. Like how Trent isn\u2019t being put out on his ass for being the worst human being. So she\u2019s accepting of it and let\u2019s them treat her like this.", "I'd lose my mind every time I step out the door lol.  I get abused pretty much every day mooing noises, fat pig, oink oink, dudes screaming out the window of their cars.  Whatever, world.", "No", "I actually do know that I was hoping by framing it like \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re just fine with this\u201d it\u2019ll make OP ask herself some hard questions about how she lets people treat her. \u201cWater off a ducks back\u201d can turn in to \u201cI accept verbal abuse\u201d real quick", "Makes me sad to hear this. You deserve better. Don't allow people in your everyday life get away with that shit. Randoms in your life you can't control, but people in your own home need to treat you with respect or they'd better GTFO.", "That sounds awful.  I'm sorry to hear that. I don't know where you are but that is unacceptable.", "Good luck forcing people to stop having thoughts", "I don't let people yell abuse at me on the street. I can't control their actions so I am not 'letting' them do it.  What do you expect me to do?  Yell back?  Shake my fist?  That won't stop them.  They laugh harder and film u on their cell phones.  I can control my reaction, which is what I do.", "Lmao"]}
