{"id": 2195, "submission_id": "ytxioy", "title": "AITA for touching my autistic roommate to get him to move out of a doorway?", "selftext": "EDIT:  Hey a lot of people have made comments about fatphobia and misogyny, and that I shouldn't allow people to treat me this way.  I really can't control other peoples' thoughts or actions, only my own reaction.  When I am walking to the bus and a carload of douches lean out the window and say \"Hey Fat xxx\" there is nothing I can do in that moment to stop them treating me that way.  I can't stick duct tape over their mouths, I can't stop them laughing and driving away.  Sure, I can flip them off and yell back but in my experience this eggs them on more and gets the reaction they wanted (much laughter oh so funny...).  Some of them are filming me as they do this, so I'm not giving them any material for their dumb tik tok videos.\n\nTo say that I am 'allowing' something is implying that I actually have control over other peoples' actions or behaviours.  I don't.  When I am at work and someone says \"Hey girl, what's good to eat on the menu.   I bet you've tried it all...this morning!  Lol so funny\" I can't say anything back without risking my job.  \n\nYou can say that it's a workers' market all you want, I ain't risking my job for a 'teachable' moment' that I can pretty much guarantee you won't work on a jackass who gets off insulting a big woman just trying to earn a living.   I'm not internalizing any hatred, I don't think less of myself and I don't judge myself by other peoples' standards.  I accept what I cannot change, and I don't let it get me down.    **Accepting what I cannot change is not agreeing with it.**   I can't run out onto the streets and shout for the world to treat me better - it won't get me anywhere.     \n\nIf there was some way we could make others treat everyone decently this world wouldn't be in the shape it's in, let alone the shape I'm in lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live with three other people, we all split the rent evenly on the four bedroom house. We live in a LCOL area but pretty much of all of us are minimum wage earners so we can\u2019t live by ourselves. My roommate \u201cTrent\u201d told us he was autistic when he moved in. We asked him if there was anything we should know about his condition to make sure he was okay, and he said pretty much not to engage with him unless he initiates it. He likes wearing his air pods a lot, and when he is at home he is glued to his phone or his pad with his buds in.   If we have to talk with him about anything we normally have to wait until he gets off his tech, so we normally just leave a note on the kitchen bench.  Once we interrupted when we were ordering Uber Eats and he seemed okay once he realised it was about take out.\n\nHe pays the rent on time and cleans up after himself so it\u2019s no big deal.  We all do our own thing. Anyways, he was walking slowly towards the door one day and was glued to his phone and had his air pods in and just stopped in the middle of the doorway. I was wanting to get by him because I needed to head to work and waited about 30 seconds with no sign he was moving. I put my hand on his forearm and said Hey, sorry I need to get by.\n\nHe turned around and looked at me and just blew up and went on like a minute about how dare I touch him, a lot of comments about me being overweight and that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t get past him and how I made him dirty by touching him. I just blinked and said \u2018look, just get out of the doorway I have to go to work.\u2019  Anyway, I was really surprised about how angry he was, but a lot of his comments seemed to be about my being a big woman and someone like me shouldn\u2019t be touching someone like him. He moved and I got by and just got on with my day.\n\nSo it seems he complained to my other roomies about it. One is saying AITA, I should have just waved my hand in front of the phone so he knew I was there. It didn\u2019t occur for me to do this tbh, but I don\u2019t think I am an AH for not thinking of this. The other is saying Trent is being a bit precious about it all, and probably wouldn\u2019t have been so snotty about it if I had been a VS model. Lol. It\u2019s no big deal for me emotionally, it\u2019s going to blow over, but AITA for touching him to get him to move?", "created_utc": 1668334317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytxioy/aita_for_touching_my_autistic_roommate_to_get_him/", "score": 4455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's quite common with ASD to have issues with touching others and personal space. If he hasn't mentioned this then it's understandable you didn't know. \n\nI would personally say I would have maybe tried stomping behind him so he could maybe feel the vibration and check his surroundings, or maybe clap or wave a hand around to get his attention without touching him.\n\nThat being said, he appears sufficient and aware enough based on what else you've mentioned to know that standing in the middle of a doorway with headphones in, when you live with others isn't the greatest choice.\n\nWhile I understand his reaction and that he is upset, it was inappropriate to react like that. While living independently, I would hope he is still receiving some kind of assistance to help him with his behaviours and to learn appropriate vs inappropriate responses and implementing techniques to adapt.\n\nIf he calls you all kinds of horrible names and offends you so personally for one minor incident, he doesn't sound ready to live with others, I worry about how he acts in other situations.\n\nHe sounds like he doesn't cope well with triggering factors, and definitely needs help with that, since if he will blow up from that type of interaction, you can imagine how badly things could go in worse situations. \n\nIn your circumstances, I can imagine living with him would be very stressful, since you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells around him and worried about another episode.", "NTA it\u2019s sweet of you to care so much about his feelings, but you need to care about your own as well. I know you say that insults like that roll right off you, but you still don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to you like that in your home or on the way to work, or anywhere. People with autism appreciate directness, is what I\u2019ve read from this website. If I were you, I would write him a note and say that standing in the doorway so other people can\u2019t get through is rude and unacceptable. Write that the words that he said to you are hateful, cruel, completely unwarranted, and you are angry that he blocked the doorway and then yelled at you in that way. Write that you deserve an apology for his bullying behavior. Autistic or not, he is the one that caused this situation.

Trent also doesn't like that but calms down pretty much immediately when the others have interrupted him in the past.  I was just surprised about how angry he was with me as opposed to the guys.  His comments were pretty nasty about if I wasn't such a fat pig I could have gotten past, now he has to wash himself where I touched him with my dirty greasy hands etc.   He just seems back to his normal self again tho.  Still waters run deep.", "Yeah, it just didn't occur to me.  I just gently touched his forearm.", "I didn't actually apologize to him, just told him to move after he paused in yelling at me.  The problem is that you can't actually interrupt him to have a conversation without him getting snippy.   I suppose I could leave a note on the counter asking him how to communicate if he is in the doorway again, but it seems like this isn't an issue any more.   I'm not worried about him yelling at me for being overweight, I get that pretty much every day from strangers on the street and it's water off a duck's back.", "Lol.  Thanks Moonydog55 sister.", "thanks.", "Yeah, there's no answer for that.", "Yep, I'll try the hand waving in future if anything comes up again.   \n He really doesn't like any interruptions.

Hopefully he'll pick better places to zone out in future.", "Yeah, it didn't occur me to do this, so I'll own that.  Having said that, he doesn't like any interruptions.  Like that time we got take out and the other roomie sorta snapped his fingers close to Trent's face and said 'hey, take out time what do you want'.

Trent never actually told us what to do if something is urgent.  We never asked him to be fair.  He doesn't like to talk too much.  The other guys have interrupted him before and he's not liked it but gotten over it quickly.  It's just my situation where he went nuclear.", "I don't know if he has an issue with women.  Every now and then you'll notice what he's looking at on his pad and I think he likes looking at pretty girls like most young men.", "Hey yeah.  This is a good idea.   I don't think any of us have tried that.  He might still not like it as he just wants to do his thing without any interruption at all, but at least he wouldn't get startled.", "The intensity of reaction may be to do with the autism, where sometimes people have a very full-on aversion to touch, especially unexpected. (So maybe being a vs model would have made no difference to that part)\n\nHowever the *content* of the reaction - the wildly out of line insults, the blaming you, whatever's going on with the weight bs - well there's no excuse at all for that.\n\nAnd if Trent has sensory sensitivities that are going to trigger ragey reactions, he should warn you about those and how to avoid them, so no, you're NTA for not thinking to find a different workaround for this.", "He\u2019s a great roommate except for the sexist verbal abuse", "Yeah, there's no answer to that.  Even if I had just waved my hand it would have been interacting/interrupting him.", "Maybe they are cool otherwise, but calling you an AH for not waving your hand is kind of AH-ey, particularly when you weren't even touching him in a rude way; they're basically saying it's your own fault that Trent insulted you so badly. And Trent's comments weren't just pretty nasty, they were *incredibly* nasty and outright disrespectful. He needs to apologise for how he handled things.", "I would have shoved him if he spoke in such a disgusting way.  You don\u2019t deserve that from anyone", "Well it is a learning process next time you may put your hand infront of him instead of touching him but he also has to make sure nobody is behind him when he just stops and blocks a way . if he is outside and he blocks a way he will also be touched , if he can't stand being touched he has to make sure ppl can pass by without touching him. Imporvements can be make but it is not your fault since you didn't grow up around him and had no time to know everything and how to handle every single situation .", "So he has an issue with bigger women? Why bring it up if he doesn't? Why not snap at the male roommates?", "I really hope it helps. Also ask him if there's any other ways to get his attention that he would be comfortable with (or at least feels better equipped to tolerate than unexpected physical touch) if he's on a tablet or something rather than his phone.\n\nI also hope he apologizes for his comments, I'm autistic myself and have meltdowns like that, but that's never compelled me to be cruel and degrade someone for an unexpected trigger. That sounds like something that can become an issue again in the future.", "Yeah, like we have had to interrupt him once or twice before.  He doesn't like it, but I've never seen such a reaction - he probably said more to me in that minute or so than all the time we have rented together.    It's probably the first time I have had to get his attention.  The other times it's been the other guys asking him if he want to order some take out or  something else I can't recall.  He gets irritated but seems to calm down in a few seconds", "Yep, this exactly.\n\nAutism can make someone kind of melt down when unexpected or unwanted physical contact happens,   but it doesn't make someone start spewing utter nastiness and hateful words at you. \n\nHe spewed what he was thinking -  and the stuff he thinks is due to his specific personality..  not the autism.\n\nI'm autistic and although i can be uncomfortable with unexpected touch - i'd never even think any of that stuff,  let alone actually say it.\n\nAt worst i'd be a bit moody,  move away and tell you not to touch me.   Then later on i'd feel bad for saying that in the way i did and apologise to you.\n\nThe lack of remorse and apology from him is concerning.", "Haha yeah.  That sounds bad but you get sick of roomies stealing your food and trashing the kitchen and not cleaning up after themselves and always being late or trying to stiff you on rent.  Trent is pretty clean, he's quiet, he pays his rent and his share of the utilities without arguing.    He doesn't steal your food and he doesn't try and steal things out your room.  I get a lot of hate being a big woman.  Like I said earlier, I walk to public transport and I get yelled at / abused pretty much daily, and I work front facing customer service so  I've pretty much heard it all before.   He's entitled to his opinion and apart from this incident he keeps it to himself.", "It's not really their problem though.  For all I know they think the same way about me. As long as they keep their opinions to themselves we are all good.   We've finally got a good living situation where we don't have to worry about thieving or having to work extra shifts to cover the rent cos someone has dipped out.   I'm not rocking the boat or cutting my nose off to spite my face just cos someone thinks I'm a fat pig.  Join the queue.", "Probably because they are not big women?   Apart from this incident he's basically never really interacted with me in any meaningful way.  We are pretty much back to where we were before this.  Trent can hate on big women as much as he likes - if he continues to keep it to himself then we are all good.  I get what you're saying.", "I\u2019m very confused why you\u2019re defending them so hard when they aren\u2019t doing the same for you? Your roomies can be perfectly livable roommates and still be assholes in this instance", "I'm sorry that happened though.  Sounds like you are taking it like a trooper.  I would have lost my mind on him.", "I know being autistic isn't an excuse for being an asshole, but on the side of the autistic person here, I just wanted to say sometimes things can happen that are extremely upsetting and cause bad reactions like what your roommate did. \n\nIt sucks so bad, I really hope he can figure out better ways to manage the overwhelm and distress from situations like this. \n\nYou sound like you're being really kind and thoughtful about this whole thing. NTA at all!", "I can't say you're an AH but you do need to approach an autistic person very carefully. He seems to be on the lower end of the spectrum but he may be the type that is sensitive to touch or physical contact in general. Autistic individuals can be full functioning adults but it doesn't mean their disability is any less severe. Perhaps just keep in mind there are plenty of non physical n ways to get his attention. You could have texted him or called him too.\n\nNot an AH. Just be more mindful", "I really hate being unexpectedly touched, but it makes me shriek and hyperventilate, not *checks notes* start with the personal verbal abuse. That's not a neurodivergent thing, that's a Trent Is An Asshole thing.", "NTA.\n\nWow, what a shock. Another person using their identity to be a dick without a care for how much harder it makes life for people experiencing genuine difficulty.", "Nta, he's blocking because he's inconsiderate. Unreasonable to expect you to just wait untill he deigns to sod off.\n\nAnd his comments were wildly hyucked up.", "NTA\n\nTrent is the problem roommate, not you. \n\nYes, you touched him when there were other options. (Personally, I would have got as uncomfortably close as possible and yelled).\n\nBut he was blocking your access to the building and you NEEDED him to move. \n\nHe then started spouting some absolutely toxic, sexist, discriminatory bullshit.", "NTA, Trent is gross. I hate him.", "soft YBTA. \n\nI'm autistic and he likely blew up because the sensation of you touching him when he didn't expect it overwhelmed him. Touching autistics when we don't want to be touched, especially unexpectedly, will almost always result in an intense reaction that we cannot control. \n\nI do think he's an asshole for mentioning your weight, though, because that isn't relevant to sensory overload or you touching him. He also should have apologized for that after he calmed down.", "Absolutely NTA, \n\nAlthough it can certainly be startling and uncomfortable to be touched with autism when you aren\u2019t expecting it. The insulting language he used was unacceptable, you don\u2019t want to walking on eggshells around him. \n\nHe also needs to apologise afterwards which autistic people can find hard how to initiate or scared of your response.

The fact that he expressed issue with someone disgusting like her making him unclean, rather than tactile defensiveness to touch, is very telling (as an autistic, trust me, this is not a normal sensory defensiveness).

Being autistic does not excuse him from saying hurtful things and being an ass to anyone. It only explains his sensory needs. He needs to think about how he makes others feel, instead of just how others make him feel. \n\nLastly, if he has an issue with your weight and has a legit mental health condition where he thinks overweight people are somehow dirty, dude needs some serious therapy. That mindset is seriously wrong. This also should have been something discussed upon moving in with you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm autistic, have sensory issues.

What would happen if there is an emergency?\n\nDo you have regular conversations during the week where you touch base with each other about how your week is going. Guarantee when we live in a group setting none of us are perfect and due to how your flatmate behaves some of his behaviour can be annoying. Stopping in a doorway is something we all do and this should be spoken about.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of these discussions happen in passing and so mabe booking time to sit down and catch up with everyone could be the way to go.\n\nAlso even though he is on ASD it doesn't mean this can excuse ALL his behaviour.

If he\u2019s going to live in his own world with his earbuds in and his eyes on his phone 24/7, then he needs to at least be mindful of his surroundings and not block doorways, the fridge, etc. It\u2019s ok that his autism necessitates certain accommodations, but he doesn\u2019t get to just do whatever the hell he wants and inconvenience his roommates. You all deserve a certain amount of respect and consideration in your own home, too. \n\nAs for the vile things he said to you\u2026 that is NOT ok. Autism is no excuse for him to think he can speak to you like that. I would definitely call that behavior out. Since he doesn\u2019t appear to respond well to verbal communication, maybe text it or leave it in a note. Honestly maybe a group text would be best, so everyone is on the same page as far as you making it clear that will not be tolerated again, and no one can say you said something you didn\u2019t actually say.", "NTA.  I have OCD and being touched unexpectedly can ruin my whole day.  I cannot IMAGINE being this breathtakingly rude to someone in a situation like this.  First of all, he's a million miles out of line for insulting your appearance and bringing your weight into things, he has no excuse for that and is 110% an AH.  \n\nSecond, you can ask for reasonable accommodation, but you don't get to live with other people and just expect everyone else in the house to center their schedules and behaviors around you.  If it were me, I would've preferred someone knocked on the wall/doorframe or waved to get my attention rather than touch me, but ultimately, I would also have to acknowledge that I WAS the one just standing dead center in the middle of a common use doorway with earpods in.  And again - he had absolutely no business insulting you, screw that.", "NTA the dude seems kinda unhinged", "If you have restrictions or rules for how people interact with you, you have to provide solutions. He says you can\u2019t touch him, but sometimes that\u2019s the only way to get someone\u2019s attention. If he\u2019s standing in a doorway you need to get through and you stand there for 30 seconds and he is totally unaware of your presence, you HAVE to interrupt him in someway to get his attention. A gentle touch is a normal response, even if the person has touch aversion. In this situation, it is HIS responsibility to provide a solution. \n\n\nI had a deaf professor in college who did this. She knew that not being able to hear anyone in the classroom meant she had to find workarounds. She knew this was her responsibility to figure out and told us what to do on the very first day. If she\u2019s looking at the left side of the room and someone on the right side has their hand up and she can\u2019t see it, that person says \u201chey can you point her over here?\u201d And a student she can see will point to the person who needs help. She even taught us the ASL sign for \u201ctoilet\u201d on the first day so we could just shake the letter T at her so she knows we\u2019re leaving to go pee. \n\n\nShe said if she\u2019s facing the board or something and we need her, she knows it\u2019s hard for us to get her attention. If we can\u2019t wait and need her urgently or have waited too long already and need her to turn around, crumple a ball of paper and throw it at her back. She made jokes saying this is the one class where you can throw things at your teacher. She also specified that NOT all deaf people are okay with this and don\u2019t do it to deaf folks you don\u2019t know, but we had her permission to do this with her. We rarely ever needed to exercise that option, but she was never upset when we did. \n\n\nFor one of our first tests in her class, she brought her son in. We were still learning how to interact with our deaf professor, so her (obviously fluent ASL) son sat next to her at the front of the room. When she was reading and had her eyes on the paper, she couldn\u2019t see us trying to flag her and tell her she was going too fast. People would say \u201cwoah woah woah way too fast can you slow her down\u201d and her son would hear us and tap her to look at him. He\u2019d sign to her to go slower, or sometimes point her to a student who had a question, and she would oblige. She did get a little frustrated with how many times we told her to slow down, but never with us for making her son interrupt her reading instructions and questions for the test. The only time she gave him a look for interrupting her was because he was vaping, which was honestly hilarious. \n\n\nMy point is: if someone says \u201cyou can\u2019t get my attention by conventional means,\u201d it is THEIR responsibility to offer a solution for when you need them!!

They tend to be coddled by their parents, and learn that they have an easy out for all their behavior because they are autistic - even behavior that is not necessarily a result of being autistic. They are not usually made to learn to cope with their autism to help them interact with people around them. And while to a certain degree I envy that, and I don\u2019t believe that autistic people should be forced to mask and blend and suppress their autistic tendencies - still, we live in a society that is strictly neurotypical, and being able to interact with basic decency is important. being autistic is not an excuse to be nasty - and what he said was nasty, and to me it sounds on purpose (being upset about being unclean is one thing, being overwhelmed by being touched and it coming out as frustration is on thing - but attacking your weight and saying someone like shouldn\u2019t be touched by someone like you, that\u2019s just nasty). \n\nKindness is not something autistic people are incapable of. \nLearning basic rules of interacting people is not something autistic people are incapable of.\nAccountability still applies to autistic people, that\u2019s not unreasonable.", "I've been reading through your comments and they make me incredibly sad, your own internalised fatphobia has led you to allowing someone to speak so horrendously to you and instead of being outraged you justify the comments, you allow both Trent and your other roommates treat like you you're less valid than them because you think that you're not worthy of being treated with respect.

Yeah, I thought his reaction to me was markedly different to the other roomies but if he doesn't like big people then that may have made him more upset.  A lot of people have suggested we sit down and talk it through but all of us are working f/t and we aren't going to have an intervention or anything.   No-one really cares, me  included.  Trent has had his outburst and a whine about how offended he was, and now appears to have settled down again.", "I believe he controlled his outbursts previously because they probably came from the male housemates", "Amen.", "Autism isn't a mental illness but I agree with the tenor of your remarks otherwise.\n\nHe needs to offer solutions not expect everyone waits for him to engage with the world in his own sweet time.", "Nah. I've worked with special needs and they can be bitches and assholes just like anybody else.", "Pay attention for any other different treatment. Just make sure this doesn't blow up out of proportion. Also can't believe one of your roommates called you the AH, makes me think Trent might have said something that wasn't true.", "It stands for \u201cmen going their own way\u201d. It\u2019s a sub that is *supposed* to be for men who have decided they would rather live their lives without female companionship, which is fine (I\u2019m all for embracing single life and sidestepping the headache/heartache that often accompanies dating and relationships if that\u2019s your choice, no matter what gender you are). \n\nHowever, that is rarely the kind of attitude you actually see on that sub. Every once in a while, you\u2019ll see a guy post something relatively wholesome like \u201cjust bought an RV, can\u2019t wait to take a solo trip across the US this summer, lots of camping and fishing and just really getting to enjoy spending time alone\u201d. \n\nBut mostly it\u2019s guys hating on women, talking hella shit about their ex wives \u201cruining\u201d them financially by expecting them to pay child support for the kids they helped create, while simultaneously berating them for having primary custody of the kids and \u201ckeeping me from my children\u201d. (The irony of claiming to love your kids so much you want to be with them 24/7, while also complaining if you have to contribute a single cent to making sure those kids are having their basic needs met. \ud83d\ude44) They push the idea that women are somehow privileged and get all the special treatment from the courts in divorce and childcare matters, etc. \n\nAs there is a lot of misogyny and woman bashing, it attracts a lot of incels. I think they get off on seeing men who actually were successful in getting laid \u201copen their eyes\u201d to the evils of women. They believe the more men there are openly hating on women, the better. They think if all men hate women, women will stop getting \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d and will no longer be able to exercise choice in what men they are going to sleep with. That they will have to sleep with any man wiling to take care of them just to survive (because they think the only way women keep themselves housed and fed is by trading sexual favors).", "I too am \"neurospicy\" and don't like to be surprised or touched, but I would never personally attack someone for simply touching me to get me to move. I love neurospicy! \n\nOP, NTA. But might I suggest you working on a different roomie situ? I wouldn't be comfortable as a woman in the same spaces as this guy after what he said. Hugs.", "I laughed out loud about this. I cant believe how ridiculous this guy is.", "Unfortunately there\u2019s a bit of an issue with coddled and entitled AH on and off the spectrum. \n\nMy daughter and I are both autistic so I had joined an adult support group in my community to see if it was appropriate for her, and what I found was that the young men in the group had learned that loud objections in various forms got them what they wanted, had developed really strong opinions about women, and were making no effort to learn more appropriate behaviours. Most importantly, they weren't taking no for an answer. They would badger women over and over for dates, and would explain why the women they wanted to date needed to change their minds and do what they wanted. \n\nThey basically made the support group intolerable and downright unsafe for single women on the spectrum, and when I made that point, it was met with loud and angry resistance from the culprits. My daughter has absolutely no interest in dating anyone, so she won\u2019t be joining.", "According to my psychologist, recent studies have been showing that BPD can be treated to the point of almost foing back to normal. I have my doubts but there you go.", "You can absolutely recover from personality disorders - that's a weird and harmful thing to state as fact. Also, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "yeah i have bpd so im going through tons of treatment right now that\u2019s super helpful. but i too am doubtful that i\u2019ll be able to fully be \u201ccured\u201d in the sense that it doesn\u2019t affect me again.", "Exactly! As an introvert {I'm also neurodivergent} who dosen't like to interact with people {unless im really close with em!} I wouldn't be living with roommates if it was as sever as trench's dislike for communication! If I went to have a sleepover at a friends or went abroad to visit em and they had roommates, I would go for the soul purpose to visit em, but I would still interact with the roommates or atleast say hi and have small talks!", "Forearm.  The bit between the elbow and wrist.", "I don't think its for you to say whether it was an autistic meltdown or not. he is definitely the asshole but let's not say how he was feeling", "If he gets this bad during meltdowns, he should be in treatment.", "I'm confused at how you know he isn't? and yes, that's not the question here. you claimed it wasn't a melt down, I said we cannot presume that, irs extremely inappropriate. Iike I said he is the asshole", "Water gun. It works with cats.", "I'm just wondering why did he want to move in with people if he dosen't want to interact with them. Wouldn't it make more sense if he move out on his own?", "Fair. I won\u2019t argue with you.", "The vibe I get from Trent is that he wants pretty much everything on his own terms.  It's not particularly realistic and I don't know how he handles work because I am pretty sure he's not the boss.", "He's on minimum wage like most of us.  We looked at his stubs before letting him move in.  I don't know about his family or whatever - most of us live here as it's LCOL.  The house we are in is pretty nice for the money and close to buses and PT.", "Lol yeah probably.  Trent's not dumb.  At least one of roomies could bend Trent in two without breaking a sweat.", "Yeah that's a good point.  I will talk to the other roomies - we have smoke alarms and CO2 alarm but we need to work out how to get Trent out as he may possible sleep with the damn air pods in for all I know.", "Same! And if people are too much for me to the point I wouldn't want any interaction then to begin with, I wouldn't move in with other people in the 1st place! If I went to visit a friend or my future boyfriend/girlfriend and they live with people theb yeah my soul purpose is to visit my friend/partner but I will still chat and socialize with their roommates!", "Lol yeah, I have had a few people tell me I shouldn't have touched or interrupted him under pretty much any circs.  Another person asked whether I could have gone out the window.  I don't think they meant any harm by that, but when it gets to the stage where I risk injury climbing out of a window because Trent is standing in the doorway....", "I think it's more to do with Trent being autistic.  They were saying I should have been smarter and waved my hands or snapped my fingers or something.   I don't think they agree with Trent's views, they just don't want to deal with trying to sort out problems for other people.  I get that.  I don't want problems either.  It just didn;t occur to me at the time and I was going to be late for the bus if I kept waiting much longer.  I have things timed so I arrive at the stop about 2-3 mins before the bus, I don't like hanging around at the stop for too long.", "As an adult autistic? That's his problem. I would have suggested putting your hand between his phone and face vs touch but his reaction was inappropriate and there's a time and place to get hyperfocused. Walking isn't one. Doorways aren't one. He was out of line insulting you for this. I wasn't given any coddling etc so sometimes find the things other autists do bewildering because I learned fast to not get beaten but there's a whole other extreme where people enable everything. Autism does mean challenges but that's no excuse to be abusive.\n\nYou should consider challenging his bullshit. You signed on for a roommate not to babysit and put up with abusive behavior. He pays rent but that doesn't mean you need to figure out fire alarms for him. If he needs special ones that's on him to figure out. Just as his needs do not preclude others using walkways.\n\nI don't do well with roommates for sensory reasons and I admittedly live alone. Been married. Also got divorced. Not over this but it was a factor. If he cannot share the space without entitlement he should get his own individual place. There's trade offs financially but I assume he has a job? How does he do his job without learning basic interpersonal skills?\n\nBefore someone gets mad I suggest this adult learns basic interpersonal skills? Autism doesn't mean we cannot learn them it means we need guidance to learn them. Some things vary individual to individual but that's not a reason to not try. For example someone had to tell me the same joke isn't funny twice. I would rather be told vs not understand why someone's angry at me. Admittedly I also wouldn't be as chill as OP about a verbally abusive tyrade since nothing makes that acceptable. I might be more functional than this individual but internet hides a lot. I am non verbal for example and I benefit from a caregiver. The carer isn't because of my autism but my traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injury. If everyone does everything for this adult they're going to be trapped by their inexperience. Who will take over as their people age or get driven off by the abusive tyrades? It's a disservice to not try.\n\nAlso NTA", "Fwiw- I sleep with AirPods in, they\u2019re good but they aren\u2019t magic. I\u2019d probably wake up with them in before my sister with no headphones at all, and she really has slept through smoke alarms before (thankfully just low battery and occasionally them getting set off by storms, not actual fire). That said, it doesn\u2019t sound like this guy wants your help or involvement, so personally the most I would do is drop a word to the people he at least treats like, well, people. Neurodivergent or no, the second he went from \u201c(please) don\u2019t touch me\u201d to personal attacks he was the one in the wrong in interacting with you.", "personality disorders cannot be cured. another commentator said some studies for bpd show the possibility but as a person with bpd im also doubtful. they can absolutely be treated and it\u2019s not the end of the world but they cannot be cured. and as someone with adhd im well aware of that but it\u2019s also a mental illness by definition.", "NTA.  You weren't being malicious, you waited, and frankly who the hell walks around their shared home with their airpods up so loud no one can talk to them?  What if you were trying to tell him about a fire or a flood?  Would he shout if you tried to tell him about an emergency this way?  I am completely empathetic about this, as I have touch issues, but if you're going to literally hang out in the path of everyone else's egress, you can't be surprised by this.  What if you had tried to just slide by him and accidentally brushed up against him?  Would he have lectured you?  \n\n\nAnd the comments about your weight are absolutely uncalled for, and while I'm aware from my Autistic friends that directness of speech can be a trait, they also manage to be kind while doing it.  He can make an effort, too.", "NTA. Seriously how does he get by in life if nobody is allowed to speak to him first and if you need to talk to them you must leave a note telling them to come to you so you can talk?", "I don't know about his family.  I don't think he could afford to rent by himself.", ">He just needs not to stop in the middle of doorways.\n\nNo. He needs not to be a complete asshole. He needs to apologize about the weight comments if he wants to stay. You do NOT deserve to be attacked like that. Your weight is absolutely not his to comment on. What a total prick. \n\nAnd, he attacked you for being a woman. That's a protected class just like his ND is. He said he wouldn't have attacked a man, the issue was a bigger **woman** touching him.  Someone needs to tell him that the next time he attacks a woman for being a woman (size is irrelevant) he's getting evicted. So a convo with your landlord isn't a bad idea, just to get this noted and get a warning given.\n\nBTW, your post reads with a lot of apology for his autism and you daring to be in his space. I really, truly hope you aren't going through life apologizing for being a woman of a certain size. Don't do that to yourself. Please \u2764\ufe0f", "Exact my my thought! I wondering why dosen't he just live by himself if he dosen't want to interract with other people? He shouldn't move in with people if he can't handle them! He did that to himself!", "Took my kid to a trampoline park yesterday. OMFG noise overload, three birthday parties it was insane. I keep my loops on my keys, thank the universe for that. \nOnly way I was able to stay amidst the utter chaos (she's six, so still kinda have to hover as she works on her communication skills)", "I recently bought them to deal with loud places.

I've not been diagnosed, but I suspect I am on the spectrum.", "I commented that a few minutes ago, knowing what kind of backlash probably would come. \n\nI'm sticking to my guns on this one. It does not compute for me. \n\nIt's a crying ass shame that people would say they are autistic when really they are just anti-social and don't like overweight people.", "oh well that's easy. he's a classic spoiled brat. You know how you see those kids who act like monsters at home but then are completely in-line at school? That's Trent. he's been shown he can do whatever he wants at home and get away with it, but he has consequences at work, so *gasp*, he can behave like a respectful human. \n\ndon't let him get away with this shit. Do you have the means to threaten to move out yourself or talk to the landlord about him? bc I'd say you should let him know that if he *ever* insults you like that again you'll be moving out/speaking to the landlord. \n\nshow your roommates this post if they're not understanding how out of line Trent's behaviour is. \n\nNTA and I could never live w room-mates bc I wouldve decked him \ud83d\ude24", "At some point Trent is going to have to grow up and find out (probably the hard way) that the real world isn't going to cater to his every need. You're NTA, and my advice is to kick his entitled ass out if he treats you like that again.", "Eh, he would have to figure that out on his own. After all an overweight person shouldn\u2019t talk or touch him. The other roommate that agreed with would have to be concerned with that", "You should not have to crawl out your window because your one roomie cannot stand to give his attention like royalty providing an audience and wants to literally stand in exit pathways.  This is absurd.", "Thank you for this. I encountered an autistic guy that was nice at first and then the badgering started. He wanted me to send nudes (but I didn\u2019t need to include my face). No wasn\u2019t an answer for him so I threatened him with legal action that could have resulted in a 10 year jail sentence. I got the biggest verbal barrage.
