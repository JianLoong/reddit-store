We live in a LCOL area but pretty much of all of us are minimum wage earners so we can\u2019t live by ourselves. My roommate \u201cTrent\u201d told us he was autistic when he moved in. We asked him if there was anything we should know about his condition to make sure he was okay, and he said pretty much not to engage with him unless he initiates it. He likes wearing his air pods a lot, and when he is at home he is glued to his phone or his pad with his buds in.   If we have to talk with him about anything we normally have to wait until he gets off his tech, so we normally just leave a note on the kitchen bench.  Once we interrupted when we were ordering Uber Eats and he seemed okay once he realised it was about take out.\n\nHe pays the rent on time and cleans up after himself so it\u2019s no big deal.  We all do our own thing. Anyways, he was walking slowly towards the door one day and was glued to his phone and had his air pods in and just stopped in the middle of the doorway. I was wanting to get by him because I needed to head to work and waited about 30 seconds with no sign he was moving. I put my hand on his forearm and said Hey, sorry I need to get by.\n\nHe turned around and looked at me and just blew up and went on like a minute about how dare I touch him, a lot of comments about me being overweight and that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t get past him and how I made him dirty by touching him. I just blinked and said \u2018look, just get out of the doorway I have to go to work.\u2019  Anyway, I was really surprised about how angry he was, but a lot of his comments seemed to be about my being a big woman and someone like me shouldn\u2019t be touching someone like him. He moved and I got by and just got on with my day.\n\nSo it seems he complained to my other roomies about it. One is saying AITA, I should have just waved my hand in front of the phone so he knew I was there. It didn\u2019t occur for me to do this tbh, but I don\u2019t think I am an AH for not thinking of this. The other is saying Trent is being a bit precious about it all, and probably wouldn\u2019t have been so snotty about it if I had been a VS model. Lol. It\u2019s no big deal for me emotionally, it\u2019s going to blow over, but AITA for touching him to get him to move?", "created_utc": 1668334317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytxioy/aita_for_touching_my_autistic_roommate_to_get_him/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have an autistic child and no he doesn't like being touched and yes he keeps his headphones on almost 24/7.... but that doesn't mean he gets to be verbally abusive.

Trent blew it way out of proportion; he could have just mentioned that you could have tried to get his attention it a better way while moving, that would have been fine. He became the asshole when he blew up and started insulting you like that. Your roommates are also being asshiles about how they're saying it was your fault and with the VS model comment.", "I am Autistic and don't like to be touched. But he was blocking the way . If I was blocking the way for someone to pass I would rather feel sorry for the inconvinance I caused .\n\nPpl shall respect boundries and you shouldn't touch him out of nowhere but he doesn't get pass when he is blocking the way. He has to learn not to do it autism or not.", "Nta. I can see Trent's reaction, unfortunately autism is a big thing and a lot of people with autism have an issue with cleanliness and unfortunately aren't good at regulating emotions.\n\nHowever, he was blocking a door way and was being inconsiderate of others. You already apologised id leave it at that. \n\nNext time probably wave at in his face but he'll probably be upset with that because it's still an invasion of personal space.\n\nI guess it'd be a case of compromising that he needs to be more aware of his surroundings and ask what would be the best way to get his attention in the future in this situation.\n\nIf it's a common doorway, maybe have that discussion that if he doesn't want you touching him, then he needs to not stand in a doorway blocking other people from using it.\n\nAs said, ask him what he would find appropriate action to get his attention. If he's okay with you moving your hand in front of him, then is upset if you do that, you can be like well you said you were ok with that if I needed to get your attention. \n\nIt's definitely not okay how he spoke to you and I would set the boundary that he cannot talk to you in that way, personally for me that would be grounds for eviction and I would tell him the consequence if it happens again.\n\nAutism as many people had said is not a get out of jail for free card and that he cannot talk to people that way consequence free.\n\nI would discuss that with the other 2 room mates, as far as I am concerned how he spoke to you is worse then you touching him and he needs to learn if it happens again it'll be grounds for eviction but you need to have that conversation with the other 2 room mates to agree with a consequence if he talks to people like that.", "My autistic sister read this and she says he's a massive fucking asshole.

Being autistic gives you difficulty with social cues and sensory issues. It does not make you insult people. It does not make you intentionally hurtful in your language.\n\nTrent was upset because you crossed a previously set boundary regarding his sensory issues. But he absolutely did not have to react the way he did. So ESH.", "NTA. Being autistic is not a license to be a huge asshole.", "NTA bud.", "NTA. Maybe you shouldn't have touched him but that doesn't give him the right to say horrible things to him. I get that maybe he had a meltdown but that doesn't have to involve bring cruel.", "NTA and it's really crappy that you've normalised being disrespected in such a dehumanising manner. Autism or not, he doesn't get free reign to demean people. Imagine if you had returned fire and spoke about his condition. Honestly, only one of your roommates is decent and you should make it clear to them as well that it was offensive, the reasoning behind it and that you expect an apology.", "Nta\n\nMy eldest (18m) is autistic. He cannot handle being touched  he would blow up too. The difference is he tells people and you did ask your room mate if there was anything they should be aware of and theu didn't mention it. My son always says having a LD doesn't give you the right to be an arse", "NTA. He is though.  He needs to apologize.  He insulted you and I wonder if he has an issue with women.", "NTA for the same reasons everyone has already said. Autism isn't an excuse for sexism and fatphobia. But since he's always on his phone maybe you could text him if you need to get his attention? Unless you've tried that already and he also considers that engaging with him without him initiating it.", "NTA. Autism is not an excuse for fatphobia or any other type of bigotry. It\u2019s not a get out of jail free card. It\u2019s a \u201cthe world affects me differently so sometimes I have different needs from a neurotypical person\u201d card. He doesn\u2019t have the right to lash out at you about your weight or anything else that doesn\u2019t have to do with the fact that you\u2019re touching him when he doesn\u2019t want to be touched (for a fairly good reason tho).", "NTA. Tell him from now.on, if he won't move you'll move him. Next time he makes fun of your weight make fun of his autism. You can lose weight....\n\nAnd no YWNBTA, he deserves to know what a punk he's being.", "NTA. You\u2019re a stronger person than I am, I\u2019d have spent the rest of my day finding somewhere else to live.", "Coming from someone who has worked in disability, including autism and other disorders on the spectrum.\n\nI'm going to say NTA, but it would be good to know if he has previously mentioned an issue regarding touch. It's quite common with ASD to have issues with touching others and personal space. If he hasn't mentioned this then it's understandable you didn't know. \n\nI would personally say I would have maybe tried stomping behind him so he could maybe feel the vibration and check his surroundings, or maybe clap or wave a hand around to get his attention without touching him.\n\nThat being said, he appears sufficient and aware enough based on what else you've mentioned to know that standing in the middle of a doorway with headphones in, when you live with others isn't the greatest choice.\n\nWhile I understand his reaction and that he is upset, it was inappropriate to react like that. While living independently, I would hope he is still receiving some kind of assistance to help him with his behaviours and to learn appropriate vs inappropriate responses and implementing techniques to adapt.\n\nIf he calls you all kinds of horrible names and offends you so personally for one minor incident, he doesn't sound ready to live with others, I worry about how he acts in other situations.\n\nHe sounds like he doesn't cope well with triggering factors, and definitely needs help with that, since if he will blow up from that type of interaction, you can imagine how badly things could go in worse situations. \n\nIn your circumstances, I can imagine living with him would be very stressful, since you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells around him and worried about another episode.", "NTA it\u2019s sweet of you to care so much about his feelings, but you need to care about your own as well. I know you say that insults like that roll right off you, but you still don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to you like that in your home or on the way to work, or anywhere. People with autism appreciate directness, is what I\u2019ve read from this website. If I were you, I would write him a note and say that standing in the doorway so other people can\u2019t get through is rude and unacceptable. Write that the words that he said to you are hateful, cruel, completely unwarranted, and you are angry, that he blocked the doorway and then yelled at you in that way. Autistic or not, he is the one that caused this situation. You don\u2019t need to be tap dancing around his feelings here, he needs to be made aware that he behaved unacceptably in more than one way.", "I wasn't going to apologize as things are pretty much back to normal.  He just needs not to stop in the middle of doorways.  I was a bit surprised at the fire in him but he's gone back to not really making eye contact with anyone or talking unless he wants something.  I was surprised he had spoken to the other two roomies about it.", "I've heard a lot worse than what Trent said, pretty much on a daily basis as I walk to public transport.   Water off a duck's back.  Tbf he's a pretty awesome roomie - cleans up after himself, doesn't stiff you on the rent and no drugs or loud music.", "[removed]", "This right here.", "The other roomies are cool.  One said I was the AH for not doing the hand waving, but it just didn't occur to me.  Trent also doesn't like that but calms down pretty much immediately when the others have interrupted him in the past.  I was just surprised about how angry he was with me as opposed to the guys.  His comments were pretty nasty about if I wasn't such a fat pig I could have gotten past, now he has to wash himself where I touched him with my dirty greasy hands etc.   He just seems back to his normal self again tho.  Still waters run deep.", "Yeah, it just didn't occur to me.  I just gently touched his forearm.", "I didn't actually apologize to him, just told him to move after he paused in yelling at me.  The problem is that you can't actually interrupt him to have a conversation without him getting snippy.   I suppose I could leave a note on the counter asking him how to communicate if he is in the doorway again, but it seems like this isn't an issue any more.   I'm not worried about him yelling at me for being overweight, I get that pretty much every day from strangers on the street and it's water off a duck's back.", "Lol.  Thanks Moonydog55 sister.", "thanks.", "Yeah, there's no answer for that.", "Yep, I'll try the hand waving in future if anything comes up again.   \n He really doesn't like any interruptions.  The other guys have interrupted him but this is probably the first time I have.", "We're all good.  I've heard worse before.  Next time (hopefully there won't be one) I'll just wave my hands, but I am hoping he will stay out of doorways in future lol.", "Lol, no.  Hopefully he'll pick better places to zone out in future.", "Yeah, it didn't occur me to do this, so I'll own that.  Having said that, he doesn't like any interruptions.  Like that time we got take out and the other roomie sorta snapped his fingers close to Trent's face and said 'hey, take out time what do you want'.  Trent was a bit snippy at first but calmed down pretty much straight away when he realised it was about food.   I don't do finger snapping in people's faces tho.", "Thanks isitpurple son.  Trent never actually told us what to do if something is urgent.  We never asked him to be fair.  He doesn't like to talk too much.  The other guys have interrupted him before and he's not liked it but gotten over it quickly.  It's just my situation where he went nuclear.", "I don't know if he has an issue with women.  Every now and then you'll notice what he's looking at on his pad and I think he likes looking at pretty girls like most young men.", "Hey yeah.  This is a good idea.   I don't think any of us have tried that.  He might still not like it as he just wants to do his thing without any interruption at all, but at least he wouldn't get startled.", "The intensity of reaction may be to do with the autism, where sometimes people have a very full-on aversion to touch, especially unexpected. (So maybe being a vs model would have made no difference to that part)\n\nHowever the *content* of the reaction - the wildly out of line insults, the blaming you, whatever's going on with the weight bs - well there's no excuse at all for that.\n\nAnd if Trent has sensory sensitivities that are going to trigger ragey reactions, he should warn you about those and how to avoid them, so no, you're NTA for not thinking to find a different workaround for this.", "He\u2019s a great roommate except for the sexist verbal abuse", "Yeah, there's no answer to that.  Even if I had just waved my hand it would have been interacting/interrupting him.", "Maybe they are cool otherwise, but calling you an AH for not waving your hand is kind of AH-ey, particularly when you weren't even touching him in a rude way; they're basically saying it's your own fault that Trent insulted you so badly. And Trent's comments weren't just pretty nasty, they were *incredibly* nasty and outright disrespectful. He needs to apologise for how he handled things.", "I would have shoved him if he spoke in such a disgusting way.  You don\u2019t deserve that from anyone", "Well it is a learning process next time you may put your hand infront of him instead of touching him but he also has to make sure nobody is behind him when he just stops and blocks a way . if he is outside and he blocks a way he will also be touched , if he can't stand being touched he has to make sure ppl can pass by without touching him. Imporvements can be make but it is not your fault since you didn't grow up around him and had no time to know everything and how to handle every single situation .", "So he has an issue with bigger women? Why bring it up if he doesn't? Why not snap at the male roommates?", "I really hope it helps. Also ask him if there's any other ways to get his attention that he would be comfortable with (or at least feels better equipped to tolerate than unexpected physical touch) if he's on a tablet or something rather than his phone.\n\nI also hope he apologizes for his comments, I'm autistic myself and have meltdowns like that, but that's never compelled me to be cruel and degrade someone for an unexpected trigger. That sounds like something that can become an issue again in the future.", "Yeah, like we have had to interrupt him once or twice before.  He doesn't like it, but I've never seen such a reaction - he probably said more to me in that minute or so than all the time we have rented together.    It's probably the first time I have had to get his attention.  The other times it's been the other guys asking him if he want to order some take out or  something else I can't recall.  He gets irritated but seems to calm down in a few seconds", "Yep, this exactly.\n\nAutism can make someone kind of melt down when unexpected or unwanted physical contact happens,   but it doesn't make someone start spewing utter nastiness and hateful words at you. \n\nHe spewed what he was thinking -  and the stuff he thinks is due to his specific personality..  not the autism.\n\nI'm autistic and although i can be uncomfortable with unexpected touch - i'd never even think any of that stuff,  let alone actually say it.\n\nAt worst i'd be a bit moody,  move away and tell you not to touch me.   Then later on i'd feel bad for saying that in the way i did and apologise to you.\n\nThe lack of remorse and apology from him is concerning.", "Haha yeah.  That sounds bad but you get sick of roomies stealing your food and trashing the kitchen and not cleaning up after themselves and always being late or trying to stiff you on rent.  Trent is pretty clean, he's quiet, he pays his rent and his share of the utilities without arguing.    He doesn't steal your food and he doesn't try and steal things out your room.  I get a lot of hate being a big woman.  Like I said earlier, I walk to public transport and I get yelled at / abused pretty much daily, and I work front facing customer service so  I've pretty much heard it all before.   He's entitled to his opinion and apart from this incident he keeps it to himself.", "It's not really their problem though.  For all I know they think the same way about me. As long as they keep their opinions to themselves we are all good.   We've finally got a good living situation where we don't have to worry about thieving or having to work extra shifts to cover the rent cos someone has dipped out.   I'm not rocking the boat or cutting my nose off to spite my face just cos someone thinks I'm a fat pig.  Join the queue.", "Probably because they are not big women?   Apart from this incident he's basically never really interacted with me in any meaningful way.  We are pretty much back to where we were before this.  Trent can hate on big women as much as he likes - if he continues to keep it to himself then we are all good.  I get what you're saying.", "I\u2019m very confused why you\u2019re defending them so hard when they aren\u2019t doing the same for you? Your roomies can be perfectly livable roommates and still be assholes in this instance", "I'm sorry that happened though.  Sounds like you are taking it like a trooper.  I would have lost my mind on him."]}
