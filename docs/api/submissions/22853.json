They pushed and got steward.  \nI said no,  I am claustrophobic ( I am)  and can only handle the aisle. And it's a sardine can plane anyway.

F what others say.    \nWhen I fly, I plan ahead, I by a refundable ticket and I pick my seat when I book.  I'm not giving up a seat I planned on for some shitty last minute, back of the plane seat.  If someone has the same seat as me, but a row or two off and just wants to swap, sure.  Otherwise, I feel no guilt.   I think you should get what you paid hard-earned money to buy.", "NTA, it\u2019s your seat you paid for. The kid has at least one parent by them, so they can live for 5 hours. The only time I would feel tempted to switch is if the kid were young and on their own with family elsewhere on the plane.

Ever notice that the people who ask always want to trade a middle seat for an aisle or window?", "The family asking you to switch seats are not being assholes. You saying \"no\" does not make you an AH, either.\n\nYour attributing their problem to poor planning, however, doesn't make you an AH. You should read up on \"fundamental attribution error.\" When we ourselves have trouble, we usually attribute it to circumstances. When other people have trouble, we usually attribute it to bad character. And that's what you appear to be doing.\n\nMore likely, they missed a connection, perhaps because an earlier flight was delayed, and the airline squeezed them into whatever non-adjacent seats were available on a later flight. If it happened to you and a traveling companion, you would blame the airline, not yourself.\n\nYou're accusing them of poor planning. You could have asked what caused them to have non-adjacent seats rather than making assumptions.\n\nWorst case scenario, maybe you're right. Perhaps they didn't decide to travel until the day before, and they themselves booked non-adjacent seats. Even then, the only thing you need to say is a simple \"no\" and leave it at that without passing judgment.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nPeople often get bumped to different flights after cancellations, where they find they no longer sit together.

Whether their situation was due to their own poor planning or because they got bumped from another flight, it's not OP's responsibility to seat them together.
