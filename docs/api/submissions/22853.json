They pushed and got steward.  \nI said no,  I am claustrophobic ( I am)  and can only handle the aisle. And it's a sardine can plane anyway.

F what others say.    \nWhen I fly, I plan ahead, I by a refundable ticket and I pick my seat when I book.  I'm not giving up a seat I planned on for some shitty last minute, back of the plane seat.

I think you should get what you paid hard-earned money to buy.", "NTA, it\u2019s your seat you paid for. The kid has at least one parent by them, so they can live for 5 hours.

Ever notice that the people who ask always want to trade a middle seat for an aisle or window?", "The family asking you to switch seats are not being assholes. You saying \"no\" does not make you an AH, either.\n\nYour attributing their problem to poor planning, however, doesn't make you an AH. You should read up on \"fundamental attribution error.\" When we ourselves have trouble, we usually attribute it to circumstances. When other people have trouble, we usually attribute it to bad character. And that's what you appear to be doing.\n\nMore likely, they missed a connection, perhaps because an earlier flight was delayed, and the airline squeezed them into whatever non-adjacent seats were available on a later flight. If it happened to you and a traveling companion, you would blame the airline, not yourself.\n\nYou're accusing them of poor planning. You could have asked what caused them to have non-adjacent seats rather than making assumptions.\n\nWorst case scenario, maybe you're right. Perhaps they didn't decide to travel until the day before, and they themselves booked non-adjacent seats. Even then, the only thing you need to say is a simple \"no\" and leave it at that without passing judgment.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nPeople often get bumped to different flights after cancellations, where they find they no longer sit together.

I was separated from my 5 year old due to a plane change and United\u2019s solution was for me to ask people to switch. What a joke.  IMO, if it\u2019s a like seat or an upgrade, I would move for someone. If it\u2019s a downgrade\u2026. Depends on how many drinks the airline wants to comp.", "NTA.  Whether their situation was due to their own poor planning or because they got bumped from another flight, it's not OP's responsibility to seat them together.  If it's *that* important that they sit together they should have re-booked on a flight with three adjacent seats instead of making a fuss during boarding.", "NTA, and that's it. We are a family of 4 who frequently fly and ALWAYS make sure we pick up the seats when booking flights.", "Info: I\u2019m sorry, is this something that actually happened to you, or a hypothetical? Because based on how you told the \u201cstory\u201d, it sounds more hypothetical to me, and not like something that actually happened to you.", "NTA. This is a scheme that a lot of entitled families like to run so they can avoid paying for extra seats. If they wanted to sit together, they should have planned ahead. It's not your problem.", "R", "If you're only \"gracious\" when it's fair for you (not a middle seat), then you're doing exactly what you said makes OP an A H.", "\"something that is not negatively impacting you\" is a bold assumption.", "It\u2019s a question, not an assumption. \n\nOP didn\u2019t state any negative impacts. You wouldn\u2019t trade if you\u2019re going to inconvenience yourself, but OP doesn\u2019t mention any negatives.", "I am going away in 2 weeks and we paid the \u00a330 to have our seats together, I don't get why parents assume people will switch, it must be stressful for everyone involved. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Isn't this why planes offer you to pay for a seat rather than random assigning?\n\nThey can ask and you can say no. End of it I say. No point feeling guilty", "NTA - however, personally I would do it in a heartbeat. If there was no difference in seat rather than location on plane then why would it bother me? To know that a family got to sit together and the stress of the flight was just on one parent? For sure. I just think it\u2019s the kind thing to do.", "We used to get our trips planed by the company (we lived abroad and the costs to visit family was paid by them) they obviously paid the cheapest one and most of the time we would get our sits just before the flight. So everything was out of our control, not \"poor planning\" \n\n\nBy the check-in, I would ask to give us seats together, most of the time it would work there. But when the flight was packed, I would just ask the crew if they could find someone willing to change as soon as I entered the plain. I never asked someone directly. And they always did. It was always very stressful, but the people near us would be glad to not sit near a child for 13 hours. (He would sleep the whole flight, btw)\n\nEdit to add: NTA for refusing to change. If someone asks, you can say no, that is fine, but an AH for being so judgmental", "NTA. \n\n\\- Some people have either never heard of the option of reserving seats, or\n\n\\- They are trying to save the money by guiltripping someone into switching seats, or\n\n\\- The airline messed up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of these reasons make the you the asshole for not swapping.", "NTA, but ..\n\nYou're not the AH for saying no. If more people learned to say no, the world would be a happier place. \n\nThere are, however, situations where it is possible to do the \"right\" thing without negatively impacting yourself. This was one. If you changed seats, it would have made mo difference to when you got there or how comfortable you were. In exchange, the family could have sat together. It would have made it easier for whichever parent was sitting next to the kid.\n\nI look at it as being a nice person when there is no reason that you shouldn't be. Also, you assumed that their planning was bad. How do you know? It could have been a \"no choice\" situation. \n\nThat's my view. But each to their own.", "Why did they not get seats together?

I don\u2019t see any reason to give up your comfort for a regular family", "I think we should all swap to prevent kids being alone on planes.  There is no way I would let a five year old sit next to a stranger without me.  But if a parent is with them?  They can work it out.", "NTA but it could be easier for you to do it, if you can avoid sitting next to a crying/annoying kid.\nOf course, I would never give up an aisle seat for a middle seat, no way ever", "NAH. It sounds like they asked you, you said no and then nothing else happened? \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with them asking. Some people would be happy to switch, while others aren\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you saying no.\n\nI don\u2019t see any reason to judge them as A H is they accepted your *no* and moved on.", "That's my issue too. I select and pay for an aisle seat. If someone wants me to swap for a different aisle seat I'll probably do it.  If some one wants my aisle seat and the only open one is not an aisle, I'm not moving. I would be genuinely physically miserable the whole trip and I don't owe that to anyone.", "It sounds made up.", "At the same time, I don't get the big deal of families sitting apart. I flew probably 50 times with my kids when they were little and often my husband would sit in the back and I would sit with the kids (sometimes we switched and I enjoyed the time alone). No big deal. Now my kids are a little older (teenagers) were often separated by a row or two. It's a 3-hour flight, we don't have to be within 3 feet of each other.\n\nI wouldn't want 2 young kids to sit apart, but for 2 hour trips, a kid around 5 or older is usually glued to an i-pad. Stick them in a middle seat, it's not like they're going anywhere.", "I once swapped and never again. I gave up my aisle seat for a middle seat, so family could be together.\nNever again, I\u2019m 185cm and there is reason I go aisle seat.
