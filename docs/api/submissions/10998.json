I worry what will happen if one becomes ill, and he can't afford to see a vet. Since he's not had them spayed/neutered, I assume they aren't vaccinated either, which is irresponsible of a pet owner. Regardless, he should at least have the one female spayed to prevent puppies.", "NTA - what is he feeding those dogs? Spay/neuter isn\u2019t very expensive compared to other vet care. Aside from pregnancy what\u2019s his plan if they injure each other?", "Try calling your counties humane society. Many places have one free spay or neuter a year for residents. If he can get the female spayed for free it'll at least prevent pregnancy. You are NTA. I've been volunteering at various cat rescues for over 15 years to help with the feral and stray cat population. We do low income clinics all the time...

If he can\u2019t do it on the spot and there\u2019s no organization that offers it for free, he needs to start saving up for the procedure.

I'm not saying you need to find a person with money, but this person doesn't know how to take care of himself when he has little, which is a really bad sign.

That argument of his will hold water only up until the day one of those dogs has a real medical emergency (needs surgery for hip dysplasia, cancer, heartworms, pregnancy issues, or about a billion other problems).  Never mind how much yearly vaccines cost, deworming, flea and tick treatments, special food (if one gets a bad stomach or an allergy), grooming, a yard and home large enough for the inevitable dozens of dogs he'll have, etc.  Pets are expensive.  The shelters where he has to bring those puppies will eventually demand that he hand over the parents, too, just so that they don't have to keep taking more and more puppies from him - amd they can get the law involved in many places.  Never mind that an unneutered male dog can father puppies with other dogs - and their owners might demand compensation.  I don't think he thought this through.

Some shelters will give you a voucher for your vet. Please pass the info to boyfriend places like anti-cruelty on Chicago does this. Ugh, that is an unsafe situation for everyone involved.

Even without any worst case scenarios emerging.\n\nNeutering/spaying is becoming to be viewed as less than ethical though, with being heavily discouraged if not outright illegal in certain countries - some very interesting points of a reason that are worth looking into if you value pet health over convenience.

In those nations spay/neuter is the base standard of care because we are combatting an overwhelming overpopulation crisis that can only be addressed by utilizing large scale spay/neutering programs. I dearly wish that we also can come to a place where those actions are no longer a necessity", "but you're just saying that it won't help, that doesn't make it true. You have no idea if it actually got the bf thinking and even if it didn't it was worth trying. Not speaking the truth because it's hurtful is hurtful in the long run", "I will add though that yeah, some of these places have a social level of morality that a lot of us can only aspire to. like, people leaving their babies to sleep IN THE STREET and only having 1 documented case of kidnapping?? Which turned out to just be a mentally ill barren woman who returned the baby shortly afterwards??", "Yeah spay/neuter was popularised by the SPCA and PETA in their dodgy years (not that peta ever left those let\u2019s be honest). These other countries have a much higher social responsibility for animal care hence why ferals aren\u2019t an issue.\n\nWhen I think about in the context of where I live, we\u2019re provided GPS tags for dogs upon registration, some regions don\u2019t but they\u2019re only $20. Dogs aren\u2019t allowed to be off leash outside of their home (nationally) unless it\u2019s a designated dog walking area, so there\u2019s no reasonable excuse for them to run off and become strays in the first place unless they\u2019re dumped. Even with all that we\u2019ve put extensive effort into threshold training and he won\u2019t cross the gate if left open accidentally (even if other dogs are being walked past or the neighbour kids stand on the street to throw sticks for him down our driveway)\n\nYes, dogs can reproduce through a freaking fence. But we know that. And we know when a female is in heat. There\u2019s no reasonable excuse for this access to happen unless you as the owner didn\u2019t take precautions. My intact male is frequently with an intact female (purpose bred working dog initially left intact for the purpose of breeding but never have) residing together for about a year. Under no circumstances were they allowed to be unsupervised when there was even a hint of heat approaching.\n\nFrom my understanding the reason it\u2019s spoken of akin to mutilation like docking and ear cutting is because it\u2019s just more convenient to get them fixed than do any of the above. Which is true, all that stuff can be annoying as hell. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less of just \u201ceasier for us\u201d when there isn\u2019t any benefit to the dogs health in the procedure and a plethora of risks and side effects (bar medical need outliers ofcourse)"]}
