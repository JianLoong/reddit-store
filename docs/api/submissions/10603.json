According to popular real estate sites, our home's value has increased by over $300,000. My husband thinks that we should sell NOW and buy a home in another state. I think that we should wait three years for our kids to finish school and move out. When I said that, he got angry and told me I was holding us back financially. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur older son (23m) will be done with school and working in the next few months, but he will need to save money to be able to move into his own place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur daughter (21f) will be done with school in June. She has type 1 diabetes and needs specialty appointments every three months. Some of the places my husband is considering are far from hospitals. She would be moving with us, due to an intellectual disability. I have also spent many hours getting her benefits where we live now and would have to redo much of what I recently completed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur youngest (19m) is in his first year of college. He is working toward a degree in computer sciences. His coursework is already heavy with advanced math and computer classes. He needs a quiet place to study and would do best if his schooling was not interrupted by a cross-country move. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband has a plan about where we would live in between places: we could all stay in our RV. He is convinced that it would be good enough, despite the lack of quiet places for our son's homework and the lack of privacy for all. Alternatively, he thinks we could rent a space in a trailer park, and leave our sons there while we spend even more money that we don't have living in hotels while we look for a new house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, am I selfish because I would rather risk a housing market correction and possibly cause us to lose a few thousand dollars on the potential value of our house than risk our kids' well-being?", "created_utc": 1677041857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118ped2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sell_our_house_and_move/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every single reason you listed is a good enough reason to stay by itself. All the kids will be screwed over if you move now.", "NTA\n\n\nYour husbands plan is a disaster. And that he gets angry about you wanting to start this dumbster fire is confising to me.", "NTA your husband's \"plan\" doesn't sound like a plan at all but a guy who sees some $$ signs and can't see past it. What will yall do for income when you move? Your daughter's medical, he's just going to pick random places to live? 300,000 profit isn't that much for uprooting your entire lives (friends, family, health, professional, school) and starting over. Especially at your ages (not a slam but yall are more established than say a 20 year old would usually be) when there is no actual good reason.", "NTA for recognizing that your husband is willing to mess over your daughter's health supports AND derail your youngest son's first year of college...for a hypothetical $300K. \n\nWelp. Now you know how much fatherhood is actually worth to him. \n\nIf he had said *\"Could we start planning to move this summer?\"* that might be a more reasonable plan. Particularly if he said *\"Let's get the house professionally appraised so we have time to get any small repairs or renos done before we put it on the market, so that we really do get top dollar.\"*\n\nBut if he's insisting on RIGHT NOW, this month...that sounds more like acting on an emotional impulse (or mid-life crisis) than actually wanting to make a good plan for the family as a whole.\n\nHold your ground, OP. Good luck!", "NTA. His plans would be terrible for your diabetic daughter, and not great for the rest of you.", "You have to focus on why your husband wants to do this since he is motivated purely by the dollar amount he thinks you will get from sell. Living in an RV or a extended stay hotel until you find a home??? WTF?. I think your husband may be getting ready to leave you and wants this money to start a new life. Nothing else makes sense considering what you have stated. Your children haven't left home yet, so downsizing can't be his motive. You have a lot to think about.", "NTA. Tell your husband his kids come first.", "NTA\u2026 I would be a little worried his plan seems hasty. Why is he in such a rush? Sure the value has increased but move across country?", "Does he understand your daughter\u2019s situation?  Her health is a key issue.  Getting her the right doctors and treatment was very difficult.  Not all doctors and hospitals are the same quality!  He need to understand this!  What access to doctors will she have traveling and living in a RV?! Also, your son needs stability to succeed in college.  I know you already know all this but does your husband? Is he being near sighted or is there something else motivating him to move? He can\u2019t ignore his kids\u2019 situations.", "NTA\n\nwaiting a few years for such an elaborate plan is a good thing. \n\nOverall, the market may stay stable and slowly increase. It is rare for a huge drop.\n\nMoving into an RV is my version of hell.\n\nTell him you can work towards it...start with a major declutter, realistically, you will need to 1/4 your belongings. So start with that...it will take years lol", "...isn't the point of having money so that you can buy a house? If anything, you should sell your current house and just buy a nicer one close by.\n\nLook, I've lived in an RV. For years. It sucks balls. Houses are way better.\n\nIf he wants to live his vanlife fantasy, he can go do it himself. Single men seem to like it. No one else does.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou sound logical. \n\nHe sounds lunical (is that a word?) lol\n\nSpending more money living in an RV with 2-3 kids who are at university!!!!! Wwwhhhaaatttttt????? \n\nTell him he needs waaaaayyyy more research and a better plan including timelines, dates, full costings as in lost wages, fuel, purchasing, moving costs, coming back and forth between states, housing kids, moving kids, changing kids schools, new scholarships, new jobs, wage changes, insurance changes (if you\u2019re USA), fuel for medical appointments, rated risk index for being so far from hospital / uni. \n\nTell him you want the absolute works in costings. Pros and cons. \n\nBet he will find he chewed through that $300k profit pretty fast.", "NTA why does it need to be to another state? What is he looking for there? Also, the smart thing to do, would be take the RV and go on a vacation to check out areas of interest. My parents spent nearly 10 years in an RV traveling and hanging out longer term in areas they were considering moving and realized the places they liked most in theory were not where they wanted to stay long term and ended up living in the one place they swore they would never move to.\n\nNot to mention what is the point of the extra money if it's just spent on looking for a new place or used up taking your daughter to her doctors?", "NTA. Your husband is making his decision with only his best interest in mind. You are taking your stand for everyone else's well being.", "Mid life crisis. That's what is going on. Say no. NTA. Five people in an RV is a nightmare.

His desire to sell is solely based on having even more money. We are not rich, but we are not hurting financially either (though he may disagree with that part since we don't have a lot in savings, and at this moment, we can not afford a vacation). We will have other options to improve our situation.

He is also collecting about $2000  a month for military retirement. Thanks to his service, we have good health insurance, (but finding a doctor outside of a military treatment facility that takes it can take some work.)", "Little bit of clarity: he wants to get the process started and move us into the RV ASAP.

Houses in other states in the interior of the country cost less. He fears that the market is going to collapse and drop our home's value to less than it was in 2012. Never mind that 2012 was the year that the market bottomed out due to so many foreclosures or that most of the value gained was actually pre-pandemic. He is also ignoring that we live in Tacoma, a city that people want to live in because it's still a lot cheaper than Seattle, and it's close to a large military base that always has new people looking for a place.", "Most compassionate American parent", "My career has been in mortgage finance. People need to stop looking at their house as income and see it as your house.  I get the concern, we aren\u2019t rich but are ok with a tiny savings, and the reality is we are living in what is going to be a big chunk of our retirement plan, but you guys have time and you can sit out any fluctuations that may or may not happen. No need to cause utter chaos for what will end up being a huge expenditure (nomad life ain\u2019t cheap when you have specific needs like access to medical care). \n\nYour bank or credit union is likely to have a financial counselor that is free to consult who can help you guys have a better plan going forward - like a timeline and savings goal. \n\nGood luck. Hang in there.", "Moving into the RV absolutely hoops your younger son for THIS college year (good luck studying!) and does no favours for the other two either. \n\nPlus, unless you've got Shania Twain's old travel coach for an RV ;-) there is NO WAY to cram five adults into an RV for months at a time without winding up at each other's throats.
