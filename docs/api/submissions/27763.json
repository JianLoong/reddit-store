We booked a nice open barn upstate and planned a ceremony which he and I were both paying for. Unfortunately he lost his job and is in the process of finding a new one. I told him I honestly didn't care for a fancy wedding and we could have a small ceremony (only family) in our living room or at the park and I'd be equally happy. Both of us agreed to it and informed the family.\r  \n\r  \nHis mother threw a super emotional tantrum and after an entire week of drama I agreed to pay for the entire wedding with my savings (if my fianc\u00e9 is unable to find a job by then) but told them to reduce the guest list to 75-100 people. His parents strongly disagreed and said we have waited for this day all their lives and need everyone to be present. Originally they planned to call 100 people and cannot uninvite now. I offered them an alternative and said why don't you cover for the balance half of the wedding to which they said it is utter crap and it is our wedding and not theirs.\r  \n\r  \nI mean why invite a 100 people to our wedding we've hardly spoken to and expect us to pay for it. But anyway, I told them I cannot do it and they will have to uninvite people. His father in all his ego said I will throw a separate reception for all my guests and that he didn't need my money to throw a party. I told him instead lets have a small wedding and throw a reception together where he and I could do it together. He said my guests are not invited in the reception he is paying for, not even my parents. I told him that is total BS and if my guests are not allowed at the reception he is throwing, his guests are not allowed at the one I am throwing. He said I dare not do it, I did it anyway! :)\r  \n\r  \nHis parents are really furious at us and my husband has asked me to uninvite his parents from the wedding and told his father they can have a reception without a bride and groom.

If you want a small intimate or a large wedding then do that. Your wedding. Your in laws can decline an invite, but they do not get to dictate who gets invited or have a reception on their terms.  You compromised and your finance has your back. Your FIL is ridiculous.. Yes , I would uninvite them too, its not about them.", "It sounds like you and your husband are in agreement and that's what counts, so NTA and best of luck to you both and your family (but not his).", "NTA -  This situation is really strange.  It's your wedding.  You and your partner should be the ones making the final decision on everything.  \n\nIt's clear your fiance's father is on a power trip.  He's not willing to spend money to support his son, but he's willing to spend money to make some sort of point?   This is some bs.  \n\nInvite the people who you want to be there.   Anyone else, don't invite them.  If someone's being unpleasant and you don't wish to see them, don't invite them.  I wouldn't be going through your future FIL's guest list and excluding everyone on it.  Let him have his little party and simply ignore it.   It's not a wedding reception.  It's just him trying to take the attention from you and put it on himself.  None of this is worth your attention.  The less you engage, the better.", "NTA\n\nYour finances have  changed, and so your ability to have a type of wedding has changed as well.\n\nThis is your event, not theirs, and you two get to decide who comes. Not them.\n\nThey are offering no financial support, and get no say. If they wanted to pay their son's half to continue to have the big event, they could offer to do so, but they've refused. They get no say.\n\nBecause of the drama, I definitely support you uninviting all of them and keeping it to your family and your friends that actually want to celebrate you for you and not for the \"checkbox hallmark moment\" they think they deserve.", "Screw the drama and elope.", "NTA\n\nRed Flag:  **my husband has asked me to uninvite his parents from the wedding**\n\nIf he's mature enough to get married, he's old enough to set his parent's straight.  It's his family and not your job.\n\nGo with your initial plan for a smaller wedding that you don't have to raid your savings for.  If future hub's family want a big affair, tell them to write you a check.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA. Like, at all. I don't even think we need to enumerate the reasons why you're in the right here - they're pretty self-evident.", "NTA. I'll never understand why weddings turn some people into tantrum factories.", "NTA. But. Your husband needs to tell his family instead of making you the bad guy. It\u2019s your wedding. This is nuts. When we got married, our rule was if we hadn\u2019t met the person in the 3 years we had been together (except family that lived far away) then they weren\u2019t invited. My mother had casually said to a couple of people that they would be invited. She had to tell them they weren\u2019t.", "NTA - they said it themselves when they said \u201cit is your wedding, not theirs\u201d. So you do it however they want, and if they\u2019re so worried about impressing their friends, they can have fun on their own. Congrats and have a lovely wedding YOUR WAY!", "Stop being a doormat. Why on earth would you spend your entire savings to pay for a wedding that you do not want? Especially since your fianc\u00e9 has no income! What will you all do for money after you get married. You will have no fallback money. Nothing in savings. No cushion in case something breaks and needs to be repaired or somebody gets sick and needs to go to the hospital.\n\nDon\u2019t just uninvite the in-laws. Cancel the entire thing. Do some thing in the park. Invite your closest friends. Have a freaking potluck picnic. Keep your money in the damn bank.", "NTA. But I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not the first time your fianc\u00e9s parents have been", "NTA. Don't give in to any of their blackmail. Have the wedding you want. Your wedding is not their social currency to spend.", "NTA but wow, what an entrance to joining the family.\n\nHave your boundaries and absolutely stand up for yourself. Expect your spouse to do the same.  But everybody involved gets to live with the consequences of those choices. All those people will get to choose, too.\n\nIf you're burning bridges with your inlaws before you're even married, remember that they are your husband's family. They're the ones he was born with and the only one he gets. Since you'll be married you are bringing them along as your extended family too.\n\nI'm troubled with a few lines, like \"my husband has asked me to uninvite his parents\", that probably ought to be his responsibility because they are his parents and he is their son.  There are cues here that both you and he have a lot of growing up to do. I'd recommend some couples counselling now, even before the wedding, because there are some big issues that need sorting out.", ">*to which they said it is utter crap and it is our wedding and not theirs.*\n\nExactly. It\u2019s *your* wedding. NTA", "NTA. And I love your husband. He's already standing up to them. Have a small ceremony in the living room or at City Hall and then have the kind of reception we always had in my family, which was cake and punch at the house.\n\nAnd all the best wishes too! And keep your savings.", "NTA. But you need to establish whose wedding this is. If you let them walk all over you now they\u2019ll be doing it until it finally causes so many problems that either 1) he distances himself from his family, or 2) it drives too much of a wedge between you to recover. \n\nPlus, where is your fianc\u00e9 in all of this? You shouldn\u2019t be fighting his family alone. That\u2019s a major red flag.", "NTA- your soon to be in-laws are bullies. I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 had your back. They sound extremely problematic.", "NTA - Your future in-laws sound toxic as hell. Fingers crossed you\u2019ll be able to move away from them", "NTA. Keep your distance from them, they\u2019re toxic.", "NTA. His parents sound like they\u2019re a nightmare. \n\nI always laugh when people that aren\u2019t the bride & groom (ESP when not paying for everything) think they have a say in weddings \ud83e\udd23 \n\nthey\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t tell them to also go f themselves", "NTA.  These people are seriously entitled.  Don't waste your savings on this - use it for something more important and long term like i don't know, a home?  How dare these people spend your money so they can show off to their friends - and your family isn't invited?  What the hell is this?\n\nAt this point, I would just elope and let them know after.  I already feel sorry for you if you have kids - these people are going to be a nightmare to deal with.", "NTA - they want a party with their friends paid by you. Glad your husband has your back and I\u2019m sorry he won\u2019t be supported by his family, but it is their choice to draw the line in the sand.", "Wow, those people. Have the small wedding. Throw a party if you want. Do what you want to do and please please please don't wipe out your savings for a wedding you don't really want. If inviting them fits what you want to do do. If not, don't. Do what you and your fiance want to do. NTA", "NTA but the first mistake was allowing them to force you into something you didn't want. Go back to the small wedding, save the money and use it for something you actually want and need. His social climbing parents can impress their friends on their own dime. Good luck with your future.", "NTA have that small wedding. Save your money.", "You're NTA. In your shoes, I'd get hitched at the courthouse and spend the money on a nice honeymoon.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents-in-law think this is their wedding when it's not. As it your husband and your's wedding, you decide how it is celebrated it and who will be atending. \n\nI don't get why they want so many people you don't know. Trying to exclude your guests, and even family, was an absolutely rude decision. I mean, it your family. Who does he think he is?\n\nIf even your husband doesn't want them to be in your wedding, don't feel bad. And I think you might want to cut your relationship with your in-laws off because they look toxic.", "NTA.  The wedding is about you.  Your fiance's family cross many boundaries.  Just have a small wedding your way.", "NTA.  It is your wedding and not anyone else\u2019s.  It is purely for who you and your partner want to attend.  It is not up to anyone else to invite guests outside of ones you and your partner have agreed to.  Considering your future in-laws behaviour they fully earn the right to be completely excluded from your wedding.  In fact it\u2019s probably time to also go non contact with their great entitled asses.", "Sounds like two less guests to worry about. Honestly do what make you happy. It\u2019s about you two at the end of the day. \n\nMy husband and I got married at the courthouse and plan on doing a vow renewal when we have more financial stability/ flexibility.", "Elope and don't use your saving as you will need it. Have a party with your friends and ignore everyone else. NTA unless you use your savings", "NTA you are paying for it and they are being ridiculous", "NTA.\nFirst, congratulations!!!!\nSounds like you got a good dude. Your in-laws suck.", "Your wedding is in December but it isn\u2019t planned, mostly paid for had real invitations when it was set to be a fairly big wedding?  December of this year?  You don\u2019t have a finalized guest list now?  Did you just get engaged and have only been trying to plan this for a few weeks?    \n\n\nNTA I guess.  Good luck to you both and I hope the drama dies downs", "Lol. No. NTA", "Go ahead and get married in a micro ceremony. Let them know they can throw the celebration dinner.", "That did not turn out the way I expected.\n\nNTA.\n\nGood luck with future holidays/birthdays is all I've got for you.", "NTA \n\nSo it\u2019s your wedding not there\u2019s like they said. May i suggest you use those exact words against them. And then let them know you\u2019re going to elope and are gonna spurge on the honeymoon. Gotta be cheaper then what they want. Also; just want to say spending that much money on a wedding just to please your in laws is ridiculous especially knowing that your SO is out of work. Even if he finds a job before the wedding it\u2019s not wise just to throw away money because he\u2019s parents want to parade you guys like some sort of trophy! Look at what I did type of thing. Narcissistic crap!", "NTA how about instead of uninviting them and blowing your savings why don\u2019t you leave the invite open to your small living room wedding. Guest list of your choice", "NTA\n\nI'm so glad you two are together on this! I LOVE what you did!! BRAVO!!", "NTA. If it\u2019s not their wedding to pay for, then it\u2019s not their wedding to hand out invites to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
