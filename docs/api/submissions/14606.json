He has a history of poor financial management, constantly borrowing money from family members and failing to pay it back. He has also made questionable life choices, such as dropping out of college multiple times and constantly changing jobs.\n\nThe Conflict:\n\nRecently, my brother approached me and asked for a significant amount of money to invest in a business venture. Despite his assurances that he would pay me back, I was hesitant to lend him the money due to his past track record of not repaying debts. I also felt uncomfortable with the idea of financially enabling his reckless behavior.\n\nI politely declined his request and explained my concerns. My brother was furious and accused me of not supporting him when he needed it the most. He even went to our parents and other siblings to complain about me, causing a divide within our family.\n\nNow, our family is split between those who agree with my decision and those who feel I should have helped my brother. My parents are urging me to reconsider and lend him the money to keep the peace, but I am firm in my decision not to.\n\nSome family members are saying that I'm being too harsh and that I should have supported my brother despite his past mistakes. Others are supportive of my decision and agree that my brother needs to learn to be responsible with his finances.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to lend money to my brother due to his history of financial irresponsibility?", "created_utc": 1681310333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jo9iq/aita_for_refusing_to_lend_money_to_my_brother/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
