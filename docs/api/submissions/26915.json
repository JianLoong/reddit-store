If you\u2019re okay with the shit she\u2019ll talk, at least she\u2019ll leave you alone. Been there done that. I see my mom and MIL once a year for the kids. Other than that; byeeeeee", "My response would be a continuation of your perfection - no.\n\nShe impacted FIL's and hubby's time.  She also impacted you and hubby and the entire household.", "Here's my \"apology\"; \"I'm sorry that you seem to have an over-developed sense of entitlement to the personal and private spaces that rightfully you aren't entitled to. I'm sorry you seem to see yourself the victim here, rather than the cause of the issue due to the aforementioned entitlement. But most of all I'm genuinely sorry that my husband's own mother is so insecure that she's ruining her relationship with her child due to some irrational competition she feels with his chosen spouse, when we should be working towards the same goals of loving and supporting your son, that's what really makes me sad in this situation.\"", "If she freaked out about \"adult\" stuff, tell her the tub is for pissplay only. That is why you got it.", "nta and you are so lucky to have a supportive husband\n\nmy in laws ( bil and sil)are amazing and we stayed with them 2 months while house hunting in Atlanta.  they have the most amazing tub in their room... I never once even thought of asking to use it because who does that?!", "She likely wanted to snoop again.", "Next time invite Dad only. Hell, have him make up a damn fishing trip or something.", "Did she say what was so special about your tub?", "She wanted to pee on your territory", "Yeah I thought she was kind of dominant too. She\u2019s trying, not winning though. I don\u2019t understand what makes someone act so pushy. No shame and no self reflection.", "Not only a control thing. But also trying to guilt you and probably also wanting another chance to snoop for more stuff to freak about about. Life isn\u2019t \u201cfun\u201d without some drama, so gotta stir the pot you know. Gives her something really good to go home and complain to all her friends about.", "Yes. Like a cat marking it\u2019s territory.", "And go through your medicine cabinet.", "She was telling you that it might be your house but I will do whatever I damn well please in it.", "Is your apology to her going to be along the lines of: I'm sorry you felt unwelcome everywhere, the only places you are unwelcome is our room and bathroom.\n\nNTA", "Don\u2019t feel guilty. She\u2019s pushing boundaries including your hubby. Sounds like he has had enough as well.", "I mean, you might be.  But you're also correct here \ud83d\ude01", "IF you allow her back I would have a deadbolt on bedroom door that needs a key to get in", "Tell her, \"Sure. Don\u2019t mind the hidden cameras, you\u2019ll never notice them.\"", "If yours is like mine, she wanted the fight more than the tub. She intentionally sauntered past you with a towel. Did she really think there were no towels in your bathroom?", "Bruh the AITA post aside, I'm jealous!  That sounds like the honeymoon resort my husband and I stayed at \ud83d\ude0d\nI feel like you got the answer that you're NTA so I won't say much more about it lol", "That\u2019s so thoughtful of you!", "Nice! Maybe when we remodel we'll do that! That way he has his and I have mine!", "~hug~", "Glad to hear it!", "There is always that person\u2026 this post made me realize she\u2019s in the wrong and I wasn\u2019t a dick.", "For what little it's worth, you have my sympathy.", "Right. And if you're going to ask someone for something..\"Can I use your bathtub?\" Be able to handle the response if it's \"no\" and keep your mouth shut. You asked, you got an answer, it wasn't the one you wanted, be mature and get over it.", "You know about r/justnomil don\u2019t you?", "Seeing their child\u2019s (usually sons) chosen partner as competition. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "It for sure was about snooping again!", "I would have kept the bedroom door locked during their stay, with the man and wife having the only keys.", "It is a script! They all do the same crap!", "it seems like his health is no longer an issue seeing that they hoofed it out of your place really fast.", "Has to be a way to let father and son have time and not her. Maybe he makes a weekend away plan without her or FIL pretends to be visiting some other relative MIl doesn\u2019t like", "My in laws did the whole \"no sleeping in the same room before marriage\" thing and our solution was to just not stay at their house \ud83e\udd37 they only got single-day visits until we were married.", "I don't know if this is a feasible option, or whether he'd even want it, but has the idea of FIL moving in with you two been brought up? You may not want that, HE may not want that, but idk the idea just occurred to me... He gets to get away from her, you all go NC with MIL, seems like a win-win (I obviously don't know the extent of his health conditions though)", "This is where you state the problem to FIL, and let him come up with solutions. In the end, he is the one with agency over his own life and how he manages participation in yours.", "Invite just him to stay with you.", "next time, put her in a cab to the airport where she can pout and wait by herself", "They don\u2019t get to have enjoyment without her getting to assert her dominance over you. If you accepted her using your tub at her insistence then she\u2019d have allowed the golfing", "Doubt yourself? Not for a minute! You\u2019re showing great strength and MIL feels threatened by you. **Do not back down.**", "When I didn\u2019t have a nice tub at home and I was visiting someone with a nice tub I would ask to take a soak and dint feel weird (I love baths!) - but ask is the key here - if a host would have told me no for whatever reason I wouldn\u2019t make a big deal out of it so I\u2019m going with NTA.", "I think she may be related to my MIL! \ud83d\ude05 She is also *that person* who posts other people\u2019s personal struggles and such for sympathy on Facebook. She loves the attention it\u2019s gross.", "In fact, we are dying since the day we are born, we just don't know how long it will take ;-)", "Fishing trip", "Maybe we can all get our MIL's together and permanently send them to an island somewhere. It can be like Survivor for MIL's, but they never get to come back. Unfortunately that might mean I'd have to talk to mine to arrange it.", "My MIL passed away 7/8/23. I had not spoken to her since my eldest daughter's wedding in 2014. She is very negative and I had tried very hard for a very long time to be a good daughter-in-law. DH ended up having a difficult relationship with her because of her treatment of our daughters. He was the baby of 3 boys, the favorite (with good reason) and I finally figured out she could not stand me for taking her baby boy away from her. We have been married 45 years.", "Lol I hosted my friend because her parents tried to pull that card so last minute she was like \"can we stay with you?\" Absolutely you can, lmao! We had so much fun together too so it was a bonus. We were almost 30 ffs!!", "oh nooooo not the facebook sympathy seeker!!!!", "I once heard life defined as \"a sexually transmitted disease with a 100% mortality rate\".", "You say I only hear what I want to\n\n(Please tell me I'm not the oldest person on this thread)", "I was a bit nervous that was what put him in a worrisome state, but since you painted him as an all right fella and it's not an uncommon joke, I figured you were being playful. Good on him for having a sense of humor.", "Don't they just make you wish you could upload people into a Sims game? Build them a little house? Take away their doors?", "Only if I can send my MIL first!!", "Humans act like a virus on this planet", "\ud83e\udd23", "He had a TIA or mini stroke. But he\u2019s totally recovered now. My husband is a surgeon so she played on the \u201cwe need you so your dad doesn\u2019t die\u201d when it happened. She also told him we are neglecting them being up north and away from them. \ud83d\ude44", "Roaches", "Viruses with shoes. \nh/t to the late, great Bill Hicks.", "My mom, who im very low contact with, will call me to tell me she fell. I don't like to call her on the phone because she doesn't respect my boundaries.  Texting works much better. \n\nThe last time, I waited 2 hours to call her back.  She answered the phone, laughing and having a good time because she was at a restaurant with her friends.  When she got home, she called me and left a message telling me how much pain she was in.  Drama queen.", "Ehhhh learning about TIA, well, I was worried for a time I had a stroke. Guess now I know what to call it.\n\nEdit: I never told anyone that I had a stroke. I was confused and concerned:\nI was drinking heavily with a neurological disorder. One night my fingers couldn't separate during some sort of weird attack and I never told anyone. That was years ago...7? I wish I'd known more."]}
