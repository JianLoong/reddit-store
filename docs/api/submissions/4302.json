I've lived here for years now and there has never been even the slightest strand of communal living, which is fine by me.  It might be because I moved in during the pandemic, but I don't even know my neighbors' names or even which units have people living in them at any given time.\n\nThat brings us to Monday evening when I got off work.  There were flyers on everyone's doors.  Apparently, the guy three doors down from me had an incident where his dog jumped up and knocked his TV off the wall, completely breaking it.  He has some friends that live in the complex and they started a collection to help him afford a new one in these \"tough financial times we're all facing as a country\" with a few paragraphs describing what a great guy he is, how he volunteers at a local charity, loves his nieces, etc.\n\nToday as I was making my dinner there was a knock at my door.  Four of his friends prepared a donations box and wanted to know how much I was contributing.  At first I was just confused.  I forgot about the flyer and it's been a lot of long days at work.  They seemed offended I had to ask what the contributions were for and explained the whole TV situation again but I told them I don't know him and these \"tough financial times we're all facing as a country\" are a big reason why I can't afford to pay for someone else to purchase a new TV.  That doesn't strike me as any kind of emergency or a cause that needs people going door to door soliciting money.\n\nThe one woman called me an asshole and another told me that \"it's people like you \\[me\\] that are preventing this place from having any neighborly bonds\" which after some thinking, made me want to post here.\n\nAITA for not helping him?", "created_utc": 1670560803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgn1u5/aita_for_not_helping_my_neighbor/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
