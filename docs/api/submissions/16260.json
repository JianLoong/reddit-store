You have 2 masters and are still not trying to get into the job market. Why on earth do you have a 25k loan for a car? If you don\u2019t have serious income you need to get a used car. My car was 6k and it runs great. 10k in credit card dept is also quite a lot. I have no clue how you even have a limit that high considering you must not have much income.", "Honestly, I don't think your fiance's reaction comes from a place of jealousy or insecurity about not having a PhD himself. If there's a part of you that believes that then break up immediately because he is not worth it. What I think however, is that he wants to harvest the fruits of labor, while you're thinking about an expansion of the fruit fields.\n\nCommunication is key; he's your fiance and if he truly loves you he'll be willing to at least find a middle ground. Don't make any decisions without his approval, but be prepared to make decisions if he doesn't approve of anything.  Also question how certain you are about making more sacrifices before earning an income.

At this point, they seem to be diametrically opposed.\n\nYou want to prioritize your education, knowing that there's a financial payoff in the future. But to play devil's advocate...is the payoff for the PhD that much greater than the payoff for the two masters? Is there a way to do your PhD part time while working? Because you are piling on the debt, and that will limit your life choices moving forward. It will affect when you can buy a house and what kind of house you can buy, because there is a maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have. Right now, you'd be relying on your  fiance's minimal/no debt to offset your massive debt.\n\nYour fiance has made some massive sacrifices to pay down his debts fast. He wants to pay cash for a wedding, and he's not interested in subsidizing your loans. Even if he's not paying them directly, I'm assuming he's paying for more of your joint lifestyle than you are. That will continue for years until you pay down your debts. But, he also won't give you a date for a wedding, which can be interpreted as a sign that he's not ready for that final commitment. Which, if he's not, he shouldn't be leading you on and should break up so you both can move on and find more suitable partners.\n\nI would highly advise you two to sit down and talk about where each of you sees your life in five years.

Counselling would probably help. Also, it will help to do some financial projections for your PhD-- I don't imagine you'd get further in debt, just be unable to pay down your current debt?

You should be able to live your life and have fun as you want to, because as you said you'll eventually get a really good paying job in order to pay things off. There's no problem in him getting a jump start on paying off his loans, but he shouldn't expect the same timeline from you. As you mentioned, you said you both agreed to paying them off, so I think this is something you'd do anyways. Just cause it's not on his time doesn't mean you won't do it, and doesn't mean you shouldn't do other things because of it. Honestly, if he ended up making a million dollars a year he could still feel financially unstable in certain ways. I don't think there's ever a \"perfect time\" to feel financially stable enough to be like okay \\*now\\* is wedding time.

Let's just say it never got to that point, because I just kept waiting and waiting. Overall, I say do what makes you happy- go out with friends, have fun, and PURSUE THAT CAREER.

My cousin was in a situation with a partner like this.\n\nYou've pledged to marry someone who has a totally different idea about resources and money.\n\nTo be honest, I hope the guy is planning to sign a prenup with you and assert strong boundaries about finances.\n\nYour continual financial choices could put his ability to pay for your future household in strong jeopardy, if you two even make to a wedding and marriage.\n\nSo, anyway, you're sitting here telling us:\n\n1. You keep 10k in credit card debt. Did you pay for your living expenses this way while doing your 2 graduate degrees? Or are you dropping 5k each year on trips to Spain with your girlfriends?\n2. You've amassed 125k in student loans. If your behavior has not been to seek out financial aid, fellowships, and cheaper education alternatives, your husband is probably panicking that you will continue the lap around the Monopoly board onto another financially ruinous square...like agreeing to do an unfunded PhD.\n3. You took out a 25k loan for a car. You mentioned that your dad will foot the bill for a wedding. Given your likely credit profile, did your Dad also co-sign for this? Did you make a substantial down payment? Or, did you buy a 30-40k car because you're the type of person who is not OK with driving a used Toyota Corolla? Is your fiance supposed to foot the repair bills on the car that you can't afford?\n4. You've spent years in school studying, instead of bringing in income. Will you expect your husband to provide for all of your seemingly upper middle-class material wants, as you continue to bring in zero or insignificant income for the next 5-10 years?\n5. You're planning to spend more years in a PhD program and haven't once mentioned assistantships, tuition waivers, or fellowships. Have you not thought about the financial side of this? Also, is your husband OK if you're spending 40-60 hours a week reading, working, and researching, along with all of the stress? I just finished a PhD. I have less hair, and some of it is now gray. Oh, and I read so much that I lost visual acuity.\n6. You want to spend more money on trips, adventures, and fun times with friends in your 30s. So, you've been doing this throughout your 20s, too? Were your parents financing this? Do you now expect your fiance to finance your lifestyle? Or will this be dad loans, on top of your high interest credit card debts?\n7. You're hoping that student loan forgiveness in 10+ years will wipe the slate clean, after paying interest on a 125k+ principal that's likely accruing unsubsidized interest. Student loan forgiveness has been changed, gutted, and backtracked so many times over the past few years. Nearly all of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness-eligible jobs will not be paying you 200k immediately after graduation. In fact, the federal government's salary schedule only goes that high for the most experienced executives with decades of experience. Going to loan forgiveness route will mean that you accept a job with mediocre pay for 10+ years making income-based repayment on your federal loans, while your private loans are still due. Unless the 125k is all federal loans, your fiance or your dad are also going to be roped into paying this for you.\n8. Your future husband will be bringing in around 100k to support the household, while your 3-7+ PhD years will bring in 30-40k annually, at best. If he's directly telling you that he's not OK with this, then you may consider other options. For example, working full-time in a job that will pay for you to complete a PhD part-time.\n9. Your fiancee has made clear his financial priorities. If you're going to do this with him in the picture and expect him to legally entangle himself with you and your six-figure liabilities in a marriage, then may God help your fiancee.\n10. Your fiancee sounds like he owns the majority of assets and will probably continue to be the primary breadwinner as you do a PhD. Thus, when one adds the lifestyle mismatch and PhD strain onto the financial disagreements, divorce is a possible outcome. If this does happen, he will likely be on the hook for alimony and giving you half of his stuff. You've spent your 20s spending yourself deep into the red and earning much less than you could have. You will continue this trend into your 30s. You're setting up your future husband for a potentially ruinous family court outcome, but that might not matter to you anyway.\n11. You're projecting a 200k salary after finishing your PhD. I just finished a PhD in a field with a favorable labor market. I can tell you with certainty that almost nobody, not even the MD-PhDs who go into assistant professorships at R1s in high cost of living cities, makes that much money. Some people with niche skills in biotech, fancy math, or computer science can make or exceed that.  Also, see point 7. If you're angling for a clean slate with loan forgiveness, you're not going to make 200k in those jobs.\n\nI'm bursting your bubble here in support of your fiancee, primarily. If you're going to do the PhD and expect him to foot the bills for your lifestyle, then consider the extent to which you actually value your partnership and love him. It sounds like he has already been pretty generous towards you.", "YTA based on the info so far, if having a phd and 2 masters is so lucrative in your field an employer would already be trying to poach you and offering to pay.

Something like \"you're not the asshole but you might be fucking up and your partner might be as well.\"\n\nWhere to begin.\n\nOkay, first, in wondering how you broached the PhD program?  The usual take on that sort of thing is if you're dating and it's something you find really important to do, you do it.  If you're married and made that commitment, well, you can still just do it but it's usually the better thing to discuss and plan that together.  You're in a very long engagement though, so for me that becomes a bit of a grey area.  If you genuinely intend to go through with getting married, among other things, it feels like that's something that should be talked through together.\n\nPersonal opinion, but Dave Ramsey kind of borders on the psychotic for me.  He's one of those people that has a quasi moral stance on debt and repayment, and that's fucking stupid.  Borrowing and repaying money is a business deal, it's not a moral contract and we would all do much better to get away from that perception.  Also, depending on the rates on the existing (or formerly existing) debt, given the current and expected future interest rate climate, it turns out that aggressively paying down that debt was maybe kinda stupid.\n\nYou, however, on on the complete opposite end of this financial prudence continuum.  I cannot recommend you follow his path, nor do I condone the way he's apparently treating you for it, but since nobody has told you I think you probably need to carefully evaluate your plans here.  I don't know what you're getting a PhD in, but I have heard the \"I expect to make $X\" when I graduate and frankly I've seen a lot of people get humbled pretty hard on those expectations.  You're already carrying a pretty significant debt load, presumably taking out more to get a higher degree, your ability to make payments will be impacted over the next couple years, you're also talking about getting married and is it possible a home of some sort may come up in the not distant future assuming you get married?\n\nYou are talking about wanting to enjoy your life, but while I don't have all the facts and information here I think you may be creeping closer to a place where that's going to become pretty difficult financially.  I've certainly seen worse, but I'd also recommend you give all of this a serious rethink.\n\nWhen it comes to your relationship though, it does sound like you've got some compatibility issues in general, and I don't get the impression he's tending to treat you with much respect, so it's not just your finances I would suggest you reevaluate.", "I'm leaning towards NAH if you break up, YTA if you stay.

Don\u2019t let the interest pile up until you can start tackling your debt down. \n\nFocus on the now, for your own sake.", "NTA but you would be one if you didn't take a step back and looked at the relationship with new eyes, being debt free is good but healthy obsession is not and he sure got one and might need therapy. His reaction is not healthy and you both need to communicate better, couples therapy maybe? If he doesn't go haywire over spending time and a little money on it that is.", "He sounds like he doesnt want you to bring home more money than him\u2026he sounds upset hes working 2 jobs and making half of what you would make.", "So:\nYou two have an incredible amount of debt. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 has sacrificed literally everything he could, including all his time and possessions to close the debt and has been doing an amazing job. \n\nYou haven\u2019t. Not only that, but you want to bring even more debt to the table. \n\nAre you even working or is he the only one? \n\nOf course YTA. \nEven without going to the program you are, due to the lack of support you bring to the trouble you both are in already.", "ESH Imo, he is smaller one. And he is being very rational if he does not want to take on all of your debt after sacrificing so much to pay for his own.\n\nI eventually put in esh, because for him due to insults. And for you for completely ignoring the agreement about going off debt. Your debt is not just student loans, but also rather large car debt and pretty big credit cards debt. Moreover, trips and events are not compatible with studying PhD. \n\nAll this tells me that you ignore the agreement and do not care about impact of your financial decisions on him. All the while pressing for marriage. It amounts to wanting him to pay for your debt on top of his own while being unwilling to sacrifice literally anything.", "She's banking on a job she doesn't have AND on student loan forgiveness.", "I personally don't think OP wanting more education is an AH thing to do. It was an AH move of her to agree to this goal with her fiance of being debt free, but then going back on it later while the fiance is busting his ass trying to reach that goal with her.", "I couldn't agree more and in reality she would be probably in her 40s or 50s before she pays off all her debt. She wouldn't have her PHd until she's 36-37 and then she has to find a job. Already has 125K in student loans so add another fairly large amount to that. Her salary expectations seem way to unrealistic too.", "Maybe they\u2019re not Americans?", "Idk why you\u2019re getting downvoted. Dave Ramsey is helpful for prioritizing debt payoff. His methods helped me pay off my car loan two years early, and prioritize my credit card debt. I wouldn\u2019t take the rest of his methods to heart, but his debt payoff priorities helped me a lot. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t necessarily think OP is an asshole, I just think OP may be a little na\u00efve about the ramifications of such a huge debt. And I don\u2019t blame her fiance for not wanting her to take on even more debt. OP says they can make $200k but is that actually realistic? I thought I\u2019d make twice the amount I took out in student loans and after 10 years, I still don\u2019t. I make slightly more than what I took out.", "I think the student loans without missed payments (in school deferment) will actually give her a baller credit score.", "haha yeah, i was one of the few who had a car when I did phd, and it was one I had previously and cost me \u00a31800. i still have the damn thing now and it's nearly 20. why spend so much on a car loan when you're a bloody student?!", "She has 25k debt in a car NOW. Who knows how much this car was beforehand!", "PhDs are different in the UK/EU than they are in the US. In the US, you have an integrated Masters/PhD program that takes 5-7 years (or longer). In the UK/EU, you go into most PhD programs with the Master's already, and you get three years - maybe four if you end up teaching or need a long time for fieldwork, but there's no hanging on indefinitely ABD. Dunno if that's the situation with the OP, but it's not impossible.", "In Australia a PhD is a three year program. Four max.", "Just to clarify NTA means you are saying the fianc\u00e9 is an asshole", "Yeah, but her debt goes well beyond schooling debt. She agreed to \"get rid of debt\" and  unwilling to do nothing to minimize it and simultaneously is pushing for marriage - which would joined their finances.", "oh i would so love to be a perpetual student but with money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni have a phd now and went into industry for the sweet pharma bucks so no ones gonna pay me to go back but i can dream lol", "All while adding more and more debt, and if they\u2019re not paying off the debts they\u2019ll have more credit card debt because they\u2019ll be living off of those more as well, not to mention the car. If it was just the student debt alone, that\u2019s one thing. All of it together along with taking the plunge back into school again does not bode well for that. \n\nEspecially since credit card apr can be quite high. What kind of loans will they be able to get with that much current debt?", "Yes I didn't wanted to judge too harshly cause I'm also just not that into cars. But I have a good job and could buy a better one but ultimately my 500\u20ac (was a different time before corona lol) car drives and has everything I need. \n\nSo even if I'd be a huge car person, if I'm already heavy into debt and a student with no income to speak of, WHY such an expensive car? What does it give you a cheaper one cant? I mean this is even more expensive than simply wanting a good reliable car which will work for a long time. I can only think its cause she's irresponsible with money and living above her means. *And* she even plans to continue so with all her events and \"enjoying\" life. Im all for always enjoying life but this has a certain taste", "Having so many degrees and a PhD in CS could limit someone in a lot of jobs. There are jobs for an individual with that many degrees, but for most that could label someone as over-qualified/more interested in the research side of things rather than the \"work\"/doing stuff side of things.  \n\nA PhD in a different field would help someone more lol. I know someone who got a PhD in something art related lol.", "yeah it's nearly always 3-4 years here, but we also don't have 125k of student loans, even in the UK sooo probably not european lol", "Phd programs are almost always fully funded. She won\u2019t necessarily accumulate more debt other than the interest on unsubsidized loans.", "The US is so car centric that I dont think a trustworthy car is a bad investment. It's like a good bed, you spend so much time in it it's a good idea to pick quality right at the beginning", "I mean, people can move countries, but it's also possible she's planning to go direct into the PhD, which you can do in the US. If you do that and actually get your ass in gear, you can do it in three years.", "That might depend on where she studied, and if maintenance loans are factored in. A good University is about \u00a330k for a Master's, maintenance loan could be as high as \u00a340k. That's \u00a370k, and if she did her Master's one after the other, \u00a3125k in student loans is possible in the UK. On the extreme side, but possible.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get student loans for a second masters, and you only get about \u00a310k flat for a masters here anyway.", "I did a quick search and \u00a310k is the low end. \u00a330k would be a very high end place. I think average debt is around \u00a325k. I've heard of people not wanting to leave education and getting loans for more than one degree, but I'm by no means an expert. \u00a3125k would be highly unusual, but not completely impossible.\n\nI've been looking into all this recently. I have a very smart daughter and a sudden influx of cash, so I'm trying to judge how much to save. We're thinking \u00a330k, so just above the average."]}
