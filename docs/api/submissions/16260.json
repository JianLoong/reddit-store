You have 2 masters and are still not trying to get into the job market. Why on earth do you have a 25k loan for a car? If you don\u2019t have serious income you need to get a used car. My car was 6k and it runs great. 10k in credit card dept is also quite a lot. I have no clue how you even have a limit that high considering you must not have much income.", "Honestly, I don't think your fiance's reaction comes from a place of jealousy or insecurity about not having a PhD himself. If there's a part of you that believes that then break up immediately because he is not worth it. What I think however, is that he wants to harvest the fruits of labor, while you're thinking about an expansion of the fruit fields.\n\nCommunication is key; he's your fiance and if he truly loves you he'll be willing to at least find a middle ground. Don't make any decisions without his approval, but be prepared to make decisions if he doesn't approve of anything.  Also question how certain you are about making more sacrifices before earning an income.

At this point, they seem to be diametrically opposed.\n\nYou want to prioritize your education, knowing that there's a financial payoff in the future. But to play devil's advocate...is the payoff for the PhD that much greater than the payoff for the two masters? Is there a way to do your PhD part time while working? Because you are piling on the debt, and that will limit your life choices moving forward. It will affect when you can buy a house and what kind of house you can buy, because there is a maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have. Right now, you'd be relying on your  fiance's minimal/no debt to offset your massive debt.\n\nYour fiance has made some massive sacrifices to pay down his debts fast. He wants to pay cash for a wedding, and he's not interested in subsidizing your loans. Even if he's not paying them directly, I'm assuming he's paying for more of your joint lifestyle than you are. That will continue for years until you pay down your debts. But, he also won't give you a date for a wedding, which can be interpreted as a sign that he's not ready for that final commitment. Which, if he's not, he shouldn't be leading you on and should break up so you both can move on and find more suitable partners.\n\nI would highly advise you two to sit down and talk about where each of you sees your life in five years.

Counselling would probably help. Also, it will help to do some financial projections for your PhD-- I don't imagine you'd get further in debt, just be unable to pay down your current debt?

You should be able to live your life and have fun as you want to, because as you said you'll eventually get a really good paying job in order to pay things off. There's no problem in him getting a jump start on paying off his loans, but he shouldn't expect the same timeline from you. As you mentioned, you said you both agreed to paying them off, so I think this is something you'd do anyways. Just cause it's not on his time doesn't mean you won't do it, and doesn't mean you shouldn't do other things because of it. Honestly, if he ended up making a million dollars a year he could still feel financially unstable in certain ways. I don't think there's ever a \"perfect time\" to feel financially stable enough to be like okay \\*now\\* is wedding time.

Let's just say it never got to that point, because I just kept waiting and waiting. Overall, I say do what makes you happy- go out with friends, have fun, and PURSUE THAT CAREER.

My cousin was in a situation with a partner like this.\n\nYou've pledged to marry someone who has a totally different idea about resources and money.\n\nTo be honest, I hope the guy is planning to sign a prenup with you and assert strong boundaries about finances.\n\nYour continual financial choices could put his ability to pay for your future household in strong jeopardy, if you two even make to a wedding and marriage.\n\nSo, anyway, you're sitting here telling us:\n\n1. You keep 10k in credit card debt. Did you pay for your living expenses this way while doing your 2 graduate degrees? Or are you dropping 5k each year on trips to Spain with your girlfriends?\n2. You've amassed 125k in student loans. If your behavior has not been to seek out financial aid, fellowships, and cheaper education alternatives, your husband is probably panicking that you will continue the lap around the Monopoly board onto another financially ruinous square...like agreeing to do an unfunded PhD.\n3. You took out a 25k loan for a car. You mentioned that your dad will foot the bill for a wedding. Given your likely credit profile, did your Dad also co-sign for this? Did you make a substantial down payment? Or, did you buy a 30-40k car because you're the type of person who is not OK with driving a used Toyota Corolla? Is your fiance supposed to foot the repair bills on the car that you can't afford?\n4. You've spent years in school studying, instead of bringing in income. Will you expect your husband to provide for all of your seemingly upper middle-class material wants, as you continue to bring in zero or insignificant income for the next 5-10 years?\n5. You're planning to spend more years in a PhD program and haven't once mentioned assistantships, tuition waivers, or fellowships. Have you not thought about the financial side of this? Also, is your husband OK if you're spending 40-60 hours a week reading, working, and researching, along with all of the stress? I just finished a PhD. I have less hair, and some of it is now gray. Oh, and I read so much that I lost visual acuity.\n6. You want to spend more money on trips, adventures, and fun times with friends in your 30s. So, you've been doing this throughout your 20s, too? Were your parents financing this? Do you now expect your fiance to finance your lifestyle? Or will this be dad loans, on top of your high interest credit card debts?\n7. You're hoping that student loan forgiveness in 10+ years will wipe the slate clean, after paying interest on a 125k+ principal that's likely accruing unsubsidized interest. Student loan forgiveness has been changed, gutted, and backtracked so many times over the past few years. Nearly all of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness-eligible jobs will not be paying you 200k immediately after graduation. In fact, the federal government's salary schedule only goes that high for the most experienced executives with decades of experience. Going to loan forgiveness route will mean that you accept a job with mediocre pay for 10+ years making income-based repayment on your federal loans, while your private loans are still due. Unless the 125k is all federal loans, your fiance or your dad are also going to be roped into paying this for you.\n8. Your future husband will be bringing in around 100k to support the household, while your 3-7+ PhD years will bring in 30-40k annually, at best. If he's directly telling you that he's not OK with this, then you may consider other options. For example, working full-time in a job that will pay for you to complete a PhD part-time.\n9. Your fiancee has made clear his financial priorities. If you're going to do this with him in the picture and expect him to legally entangle himself with you and your six-figure liabilities in a marriage, then may God help your fiancee.\n10. Your fiancee sounds like he owns the majority of assets and will probably continue to be the primary breadwinner as you do a PhD. Thus, when one adds the lifestyle mismatch and PhD strain onto the financial disagreements, divorce is a possible outcome. If this does happen, he will likely be on the hook for alimony and giving you half of his stuff. You've spent your 20s spending yourself deep into the red and earning much less than you could have. You will continue this trend into your 30s. You're setting up your future husband for a potentially ruinous family court outcome, but that might not matter to you anyway.\n11. You're projecting a 200k salary after finishing your PhD. I just finished a PhD in a field with a favorable labor market. I can tell you with certainty that almost nobody, not even the MD-PhDs who go into assistant professorships at R1s in high cost of living cities, makes that much money. Some people with niche skills in biotech, fancy math, or computer science can make or exceed that.  Also, see point 7. If you're angling for a clean slate with loan forgiveness, you're not going to make 200k in those jobs.\n\nI'm bursting your bubble here in support of your fiancee, primarily. If you're going to do the PhD and expect him to foot the bills for your lifestyle, then consider the extent to which you actually value your partnership and love him. It sounds like he has already been pretty generous towards you.", "YTA based on the info so far, if having a phd and 2 masters is so lucrative in your field an employer would already be trying to poach you and offering to pay.

Something like \"you're not the asshole but you might be fucking up and your partner might be as well.\"\n\nWhere to begin.\n\nOkay, first, in wondering how you broached the PhD program?  The usual take on that sort of thing is if you're dating and it's something you find really important to do, you do it.  If you're married and made that commitment, well, you can still just do it but it's usually the better thing to discuss and plan that together.  You're in a very long engagement though, so for me that becomes a bit of a grey area.  If you genuinely intend to go through with getting married, among other things, it feels like that's something that should be talked through together.\n\nPersonal opinion, but Dave Ramsey kind of borders on the psychotic for me.  He's one of those people that has a quasi moral stance on debt and repayment, and that's fucking stupid.  Borrowing and repaying money is a business deal, it's not a moral contract and we would all do much better to get away from that perception.  Also, depending on the rates on the existing (or formerly existing) debt, given the current and expected future interest rate climate, it turns out that aggressively paying down that debt was maybe kinda stupid.\n\nYou, however, on on the complete opposite end of this financial prudence continuum.  I cannot recommend you follow his path, nor do I condone the way he's apparently treating you for it, but since nobody has told you I think you probably need to carefully evaluate your plans here.  I don't know what you're getting a PhD in, but I have heard the \"I expect to make $X\" when I graduate and frankly I've seen a lot of people get humbled pretty hard on those expectations.  You're already carrying a pretty significant debt load, presumably taking out more to get a higher degree, your ability to make payments will be impacted over the next couple years, you're also talking about getting married and is it possible a home of some sort may come up in the not distant future assuming you get married?\n\nYou are talking about wanting to enjoy your life, but while I don't have all the facts and information here I think you may be creeping closer to a place where that's going to become pretty difficult financially.  I've certainly seen worse, but I'd also recommend you give all of this a serious rethink.\n\nWhen it comes to your relationship though, it does sound like you've got some compatibility issues in general, and I don't get the impression he's tending to treat you with much respect, so it's not just your finances I would suggest you reevaluate.", "I'm leaning towards NAH if you break up, YTA if you stay.

Also, it should be noted that any grad school worth its salt will offer its students funding and tuition remission, OP even considering programs that could put her even more in debt is probably and indication that even with a PhD from these programs she won't be making anything, because that doctorate won't be worth anything.", "That's what I want to know", "Could be mean that over the 20-25 years he'll be paying more in the long run and with the tax bill it ultimately costs more? I'm not sure how to do the math on that without knowing payment minimums.", "Hasn\u2019t the political talk about student debt forgiveness been going on for ages with nothing happening? Not sure if that is necessarily political differences, could just be a lack of faith in politicians", "I don't know. Student loan debt is one thing, but having ballooning cc debt is another. I could see myself getting really mad about it too.", "Is \u201cyou\u2019re dumb for waiting for student loan forgiveness\u201d even politically biased?

It ***IS*** dumb to have $125k+ in student loans and take on more and think \"ah this will all be forgiven away\".  \n\nIt didn't say it was dumb to think student loan forgiveness will take some of it.  He said it's dumb to plan on it when she's got so much debt.", "It is dumb to take on a PhD program assuming that you will get student debt forgiveness.", "Someone crying for student loan forgiveness but also wanting to take on more student loans for a PhD *is* dumb.\n\n\u201cMaking my problem worse will solve the problem!\u201d", "It\u2019s not a political difference though.

You stem guys are getting scammed like a Mofo. I only have a 2 year degree and make more than you. I haven\u2019t been doing it for very long either.", "With that amount of school debt and car debt, 100% the OP are Americans", "This for sure! The amount of people that apply for roles with 2-3 professional degrees and no work experience is wild. Those applications don\u2019t even go in the \u201cmaybe\u201d pile since, quite frankly, I don\u2019t want to teach people how to navigate a workplace on top of the actual job. Professional student syndrome is real. \n\nMy advice is take a break from academia and actually work unless your field of work absolutely requires you to have a PhD (but those are so few and far between).", "It\u2019s almost never a living wage. Why do you think grad students are striking? AT BEST you make $25k a year as a TA/RA or instructor while in school. Most people can\u2019t make ends meet on that and take out loans to survive. OP\u2019s fancy lifestyle wouldn\u2019t be possible unless her fianc\u00e9 subsidized her living expenses, which it sounds like he (rightly) does not want to do", "That\u2019s a fair assessment. \n\nYou\u2019re also right. The three friends I have with ONE higher education beyond a bachelors specifically targeted those programs and finished them ASAP to get the job they want. I feel like OP is going to do that, but as you said, with two masters programs under her belt, it\u2019s weird that she hasn\u2019t yet done that.", "\"The wheels of justice and government turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine.\"\n\nThere's been action slowly happening. It would have happened already, but the GOP has taken it to court, so now it's up to the judiciary (fortunately the fastest wheel, but still slow).", "Calling your partner names is still not a valid way to solve the problem, *or* a healthy way to deal with anger.

Your motives can be understandable and you can still be TA in that situation.", "a) Don't call your romantic partner \"dumb\" no matter how frustrated you are.\n\nb) He called her dumb because of her political position re: student loan debt, nothing to do with the cc debt.", "There is no way she just sat there and said that she wants a PHD out of nowhere - sounds like she had been planning this stuff out for a while and the guy thought she was bluffing or didn't realize how expensive it was.", "Yes but if you are so mad that you're calling your partner an idiot because they believe in student loan forgiveness, then you are not a good partner, nor a decent person imo. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37 Because normal people don't call their partners idiots for something like that. At least not if they actually care about them.", "You know what? My bad. I read it as \"You're dumb for *wanting* student loan forgiveness.\" Never read Reddit before second coffee.\n\nThat said, yeah, I think calling your partner \"dumb\" is a problem and I would be out the door if my partner treated me like that.", "Nowhere in the post does it say she is planning to fund her PhD with loans and outside of the humanities, PhDs are rarely funded with loans.", "That's not the conversation she described.", "Almost all of the PhD programs I looked at involved teaching undergrads to offset the actual cost of the doctoral program... If anything the doctoral students ended up breaking even or slightly better between teaching and prospective loans.", "You have made a leap: that she supports student loan forgiveness for personal rather than political reasons. What's been discussed so far is forgiving 8% of her student debt (and less than 7% of her overall debt) so the likelihood that the prospect of loan forgiveness is driving her planning seems very low.\n\nETA: It's the rare PhD program, at least outside the humanities, that is funded with loans. Grants are far more typical.

In my country, you are basically considered married once you have lived with a partner for two years.

If not/if she\u2019s not yet in her final year, it may be worth looking for an integrated masters course in her field, as these use undergraduate student finance. So she\u2019d get the course fees completely covered, and still get her maintenance loan for living costs.\n\nIn general, in the UK you should follow the opposite advice to the US and get all of the loan amounts you\u2019re eligible for, since it acts as a graduate tax for 30 years and then is wiped anyway."]}
