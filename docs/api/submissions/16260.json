At this point, they seem to be diametrically opposed.\n\nYou want to prioritize your education, knowing that there's a financial payoff in the future.

Because you are piling on the debt, and that will limit your life choices moving forward. It will affect when you can buy a house and what kind of house you can buy, because there is a maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have. Right now, you'd be relying on your  fiance's minimal/no debt to offset your massive debt.\n\nYour fiance has made some massive sacrifices to pay down his debts fast. He wants to pay cash for a wedding, and he's not interested in subsidizing your loans. Even if he's not paying them directly, I'm assuming he's paying for more of your joint lifestyle than you are. That will continue for years until you pay down your debts. But, he also won't give you a date for a wedding, which can be interpreted as a sign that he's not ready for that final commitment. Which, if he's not, he shouldn't be leading you on and should break up so you both can move on and find more suitable partners.\n\nI would highly advise you two to sit down and talk about where each of you sees your life in five years.

You should be able to live your life and have fun as you want to, because as you said you'll eventually get a really good paying job in order to pay things off. There's no problem in him getting a jump start on paying off his loans, but he shouldn't expect the same timeline from you. As you mentioned, you said you both agreed to paying them off, so I think this is something you'd do anyways. Just cause it's not on his time doesn't mean you won't do it, and doesn't mean you shouldn't do other things because of it. Honestly, if he ended up making a million dollars a year he could still feel financially unstable in certain ways. I don't think there's ever a \"perfect time\" to feel financially stable enough to be like okay \\*now\\* is wedding time.

If your behavior has not been to seek out financial aid, fellowships, and cheaper education alternatives, your husband is probably panicking that you will continue the lap around the Monopoly board onto another financially ruinous square...like agreeing to do an unfunded PhD.\n3. You took out a 25k loan for a car. You mentioned that your dad will foot the bill for a wedding. Given your likely credit profile, did your Dad also co-sign for this? Did you make a substantial down payment? Or, did you buy a 30-40k car because you're the type of person who is not OK with driving a used Toyota Corolla? Is your fiance supposed to foot the repair bills on the car that you can't afford?\n4. You've spent years in school studying, instead of bringing in income. Will you expect your husband to provide for all of your seemingly upper middle-class material wants, as you continue to bring in zero or insignificant income for the next 5-10 years?\n5. You're planning to spend more years in a PhD program and haven't once mentioned assistantships, tuition waivers, or fellowships. Have you not thought about the financial side of this? Also, is your husband OK if you're spending 40-60 hours a week reading, working, and researching, along with all of the stress? I just finished a PhD. I have less hair, and some of it is now gray. Oh, and I read so much that I lost visual acuity.\n6. You want to spend more money on trips, adventures, and fun times with friends in your 30s. So, you've been doing this throughout your 20s, too? Were your parents financing this? Do you now expect your fiance to finance your lifestyle? Or will this be dad loans, on top of your high interest credit card debts?\n7. You're hoping that student loan forgiveness in 10+ years will wipe the slate clean, after paying interest on a 125k+ principal that's likely accruing unsubsidized interest. Student loan forgiveness has been changed, gutted, and backtracked so many times over the past few years. Nearly all of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness-eligible jobs will not be paying you 200k immediately after graduation. In fact, the federal government's salary schedule only goes that high for the most experienced executives with decades of experience. Going to loan forgiveness route will mean that you accept a job with mediocre pay for 10+ years making income-based repayment on your federal loans, while your private loans are still due. Unless the 125k is all federal loans, your fiance or your dad are also going to be roped into paying this for you.\n8. Your future husband will be bringing in around 100k to support the household, while your 3-7+ PhD years will bring in 30-40k annually, at best. If he's directly telling you that he's not OK with this, then you may consider other options. For example, working full-time in a job that will pay for you to complete a PhD part-time.\n9. Your fiancee has made clear his financial priorities. If you're going to do this with him in the picture and expect him to legally entangle himself with you and your six-figure liabilities in a marriage, then may God help your fiancee.\n10. Your fiancee sounds like he owns the majority of assets and will probably continue to be the primary breadwinner as you do a PhD. Thus, when one adds the lifestyle mismatch and PhD strain onto the financial disagreements, divorce is a possible outcome. If this does happen, he will likely be on the hook for alimony and giving you half of his stuff. You've spent your 20s spending yourself deep into the red and earning much less than you could have. You will continue this trend into your 30s. You're setting up your future husband for a potentially ruinous family court outcome, but that might not matter to you anyway.\n11. You're projecting a 200k salary after finishing your PhD. I just finished a PhD in a field with a favorable labor market. I can tell you with certainty that almost nobody, not even the MD-PhDs who go into assistant professorships at R1s in high cost of living cities, makes that much money. Some people with niche skills in biotech, fancy math, or computer science can make or exceed that.  Also, see point 7. If you're angling for a clean slate with loan forgiveness, you're not going to make 200k in those jobs.\n\nI'm bursting your bubble here in support of your fiancee, primarily. If you're going to do the PhD and expect him to foot the bills for your lifestyle, then consider the extent to which you actually value your partnership and love him. It sounds like he has already been pretty generous towards you.", "YTA based on the info so far, if having a phd and 2 masters is so lucrative in your field an employer would already be trying to poach you and offering to pay.

Something like \"you're not the asshole but you might be fucking up and your partner might be as well.\"\n\nWhere to begin.\n\nOkay, first, in wondering how you broached the PhD program?  The usual take on that sort of thing is if you're dating and it's something you find really important to do, you do it.  If you're married and made that commitment, well, you can still just do it but it's usually the better thing to discuss and plan that together.  You're in a very long engagement though, so for me that becomes a bit of a grey area.  If you genuinely intend to go through with getting married, among other things, it feels like that's something that should be talked through together.\n\nPersonal opinion, but Dave Ramsey kind of borders on the psychotic for me.  He's one of those people that has a quasi moral stance on debt and repayment, and that's fucking stupid.  Borrowing and repaying money is a business deal, it's not a moral contract and we would all do much better to get away from that perception.  Also, depending on the rates on the existing (or formerly existing) debt, given the current and expected future interest rate climate, it turns out that aggressively paying down that debt was maybe kinda stupid.\n\nYou, however, on on the complete opposite end of this financial prudence continuum.  I cannot recommend you follow his path, nor do I condone the way he's apparently treating you for it, but since nobody has told you I think you probably need to carefully evaluate your plans here.  I don't know what you're getting a PhD in, but I have heard the \"I expect to make $X\" when I graduate and frankly I've seen a lot of people get humbled pretty hard on those expectations.  You're already carrying a pretty significant debt load, presumably taking out more to get a higher degree, your ability to make payments will be impacted over the next couple years, you're also talking about getting married and is it possible a home of some sort may come up in the not distant future assuming you get married?\n\nYou are talking about wanting to enjoy your life, but while I don't have all the facts and information here I think you may be creeping closer to a place where that's going to become pretty difficult financially.  I've certainly seen worse, but I'd also recommend you give all of this a serious rethink.\n\nWhen it comes to your relationship though, it does sound like you've got some compatibility issues in general, and I don't get the impression he's tending to treat you with much respect, so it's not just your finances I would suggest you reevaluate.", "I'm leaning towards NAH if you break up, YTA if you stay.

I also think it\u2019s acceptable to have debt out of school if you plan to actually do something with your degree and pay off the debt.

My friend group has, weirdly, a lot of PhD\u2019s in a wide variety of fields. \n\n\nEx 1: PhD in Art History, specialty in a very specific time and place for that culture\u2019s architecture. Virtually no private sector jobs, straight into academia, bounced around institutions for several years until they got into a tenure track position (and is now doing quite well). Right after PhD salary was *maybe* $75k. Same for another friend with a PhD in Media Law, on all fronts.\n\n\nEx 2: PhD in psychology. Few offers in private industry (that they were interested in), went to work for the federal government. Starting salary $85k, going up to $95k after 4 years. Similar for a friend who had a really obscure PhD track that required a lot of research, taught community college / adjunct professor (less than $50k) until they were recruited by the federal government for a job that required a ton of in-house research; same pay rate as psychologist.  \n\n\nEx 3: PhD in Biochemistry. Depends a lot of the exact r\u00f4le, but starting at $125k - $150k isn\u2019t unusual. \n\n\nEx 4: PhD in Computer Science / Software Engineering. Depends on the company, whether it\u2019s a startup or an older, established company. In a startup, less salary but lots of stock options, so starting salary *maybe* $125k - $150k; in larger, more established companies, higher salary but fewer stock options, starting salary $150k - $175k. \n\n\nHonestly, of all the people I know with PhD\u2019s, in their fields, they have to have some years of experience under their belt (5+, preferably 10) in a lucrative field (usually STEM, especially pharma, software engineering, electrical or chemical engineering) before they crack $200k.  The only weird exception is a friend who got a PhD in biochem, and while working as a postdoc decided to go to Med School and became a highly-paid physician, and never really used their PhD (except as an adjunct to their work as a MD). \n\n\nSo, looking at OP\u2019s timeline, they\u2019ll be \u2018maintenance\u2019 wages for the next 3 - 4 years, which sounds like minimum payments on debt, so the student loan won\u2019t get smaller and will likely get larger, the car debt will decrease, and the CC I\u2019d expect to grow based on their statements on their fiscal conservatism. So coming out of the PhD still $175k in debt. \n\n\nThen they\u2019d be entering the job market at 37 with what sounds like no real-world experience (those 2 Masters probably took most of their time between ages 21 and 33). Which means that a) they\u2019re pretty unlikely to get their dream job, and b) their starting salary will be at the bottom of the range for whatever job they get. \n\n\nGiven they\u2019ve racked up $125k in student loan debt, and most colleges don\u2019t make you pay for graduate tuition in lucrative fields, they have you teach and pay a stipend, that says to me a) that college debt is already 10+ years old, and b) those Masters aren\u2019t in a lucrative field, so the PhD likely isn\u2019t either, or if it is, it\u2019s a high-paying one with *very* few positions. \n\n\nIf they\u2019re lucky, that\u2019s maybe $125k - $150k for the first 3 - 4 years, $200k sounds really pie-in-the-sky to me.", "I don\u2019t know who that is.", "It\u2019s not the boundary-setting that make him one.

Sadly, I am correct.\n\nYour assumptions either (a) don't make sense or (b) aren't on the scale of what I'm  talking about (and a few are both).\n\nIt sounds like your not familiar with these type of loan repayment programs. Just think of them as a fancy, government sponsored version of a payday loan bc that's essentially what they are:\n\n* \"Currently, student loan forgiveness is not taxable until 2025\" as I said, I'm \\~10 years into a 25 repayment plan so obviously I will not hit forgiveness in the next 2 years.\n* As I said, I currently have \\~$300k in student loan debt (PhD in clinical psychology). Original loan amount was \\~$175k but if you are familiar with the concept of \"interest,\" you'll know that it accrues over time. If you are on an income-based repayment plan (which you basically have to be since clinical psychology requires at least one of an internship after graduation and most pay at or just above the poverty line) you can't afford to start repaying until a while after graduation. (Fun Fact: At the hospital I did my 45+hours/week internship at, I was classified as a volunteer because they paid us so little, $800/month in a HCOL California city, that they couldn't call it wages, it had to be a \"stipend.\") So between graduation and my first \"real\" job (to work in my area of psychology you can't get a job without that internship plus a 2 year fellowship after that), my loan was almost at $200k. Some psychologists make crazy amounts of money ($200k/year) but most of us are in the $90k-$130k range. Currently, I would need to be paying $900+/month to simply prevent the \\*interest\\* from increasing (forget paying anything to principal) so it will continue to increase over then next 15 years between now and when it's forgiven.\n* Getting to the forgiveness calculation. Let's say I'm paying $12,000/year to keep the loan and interest from increasing further (I have a \\~7% interest rate and can't refinance because that means leaving the loan forgiveness program and I would basically have a mortgage on an invisible house), then in 15 years (or $180,000 later for me, 15\\*$12,000/year = $180,000), the forgiven amount of my student loans will be \\~$300,000 so my \"income\" for that year will be $300k + my actual income (you left that off in your assumption from before where you said that my tax bill would be based on $100k for the year so $22k bill. Lol. Dare to dream. That's my regular tax without any loan forgiveness stuff factored in.). My current income is around $110k but let's say in 15 years I'm at $160k then my tax rate would be based on $460k, the tax bill would be about $190k (federal plus state).\n* So I have already paid about $60k towards my loans, if I pay \\~$900/month between now and my forgiveness point to keep them from growing further, that's another $180k (now we're at $240k paid) plus the end tax bill of $190k, that's me paying $430k on a $170k loan.\n* I am not aware of/the tax people/financial planners that I've consulted with weren't aware of any deductions that significantly impact the tax debt I would be incurring. I believe the tax bill could be spread out but that's not helpful. In my early 50's I would then get to start paying down a \\*new\\* $190k debt??? One that is more than the starting point on the one I had just spent the last 25 years paying on??? How is that helpful? Think that thru a little bit.\n\nDo you honestly think that I haven't spent endless hours thinking about this and researching this? Do you think this doesn't keep me up at night?\n\nAs mentioned, I have asked multiple tax/financial planning professionals and there aren't any work arounds. This is how these programs \"work\" (obviously they don't work but this is exactly how it was designed).\n\nPreviously, I was trying to paying them off but after realizing that I can't, I shifted strategies and for the past two years, I'm only paying the minimum and I'm saving as much as I can so that in 15 years, I have $250k in cash to pay off a massive tax bill. If I go that route, I will \"only\" pay the $60k that I've paid so far + \\~$50k more in interest payments + the tax bill $250k (at least since, with my super fun 7% interest rate, the loan amount will likely be close to $450k by then) or so I will \"only\" pay about $300k.\n\nMaybe instead of telling someone \"you're wrong!\" and offering simplistic calculations not based on any of the actual information provided, you could say, \"I'm not sure if that's right, by my understanding, I think it's like this...\" I promise that I have put a lot more time and research into the specifics of my specific financial situation than you have.", "Reeeeeaally, but she is being so \"dumb\" about finances.\n\nAnd she sounds like she wants to have him support her dreams but not support his dreams of being debt-free.\n\nShe is \"dumb\" and the AH here", "No making decisions based on a hope student loans will be forgiven is really dumb.", "She already has 2 masters (or nearly), now the PhD.

Good people can do bad things and I would ask; if you recognize your own behavior in this dude (and not saying that\u2019s definitely the case here) then why do you feel the need to justify his behavior instead of coming to a reckoning with your own?

It doesn't make you TA, but financially you are definitely in the wrong here by a mile.\n\nThat you have TWO MASTERS' DEGREES and want to take out MORE STUDENT LOANS when you're already $125k deep is just wild. If you are able to earn what you anticipate, which is a gigantic IF, then that $200k is going to be in the low $100s post-tax, and you will spend a high percentage of it on non discretionary spending.\n\nThat you owe $10k in credit card debt and want to \"enjoy your early 30s,\" belies a concerning lack of financial literacy on your part. You are already not in control of your finances, having not yet gone on these trips you speak of. That you owe $25k on your car means you are driving a nicer vehicle than you need to be, since you could exchange that car for an old beater sedan and come pretty close to eliminating this line of debt today. To-day. You are spending a couple grand a year on avoidable auto debt interest, and a couple grand a year MORE on credit card debt *interest.* That's just what you're already paying creditors for your own money, and that's not even talking about the several thousand a year you are paying in student loan interest. Aside from the student loans, these numbers are probably really bad for your credit score, and this will increase the cost of homeownership for  your fledgling marriage if you don't do something about it.\n\nIf the job you anticipate getting after school doesn't contain the word \"professor,\" then you do not need that PhD for any reason besides wanting more letters after your name. You should take your two masters' degrees out into those streets and start making some money. If you can earn anything close to what you say you will, and restrain yourself from all of this overspending it sounds like you've been doing, then paying off your auto and credit card debt should be achievable for you in a year. Even your student loans should go down in another year if your partner works together with you, which it sounds like he would. If you can't get your debts under control, then you won't be financially solvent and then you really aren't going to get to do any of that travelling you think is going to happen.\n\nBy contrast, if you pay off these other debts then going for that PhD in a couple or few years wouldn't be a totally reckless and immature thing to do. If I were you, and wanted to make this relationship work, I would try to make a deal with your partner where if you work hard together to retire all *other* debts, you can then take out loans for your doctorate. It's not reasonable for him to say you can *never* go, and paying or a PhD in cash is a ridiculous suggestion. Then again, most people don't rack of six figures of debt and two Master's degrees BEFORE going for a doctorate. Nobody's trying to hold you back from your dreams, but you already owe a ton of money and are still talking about all the things you want to spend on.\n\nDave Ramsey is a pretty sophomoric financial advisor, but there are worse things to be than a believer in living without debt. I would not get married without sorting out these differences in priorities, but if it were one absolute or the other, you partner is making better decisions than you are, even if he is dealing in extremes and absolutes. He shouldn't ever call you \"dumb,\" but in my capacity as a stranger on the internet, going for your PhD at this time would be dumb. \n\nMy recommendation is that you make a grand bargain with him, where you take a few years to work hard together and pay off all of your debts, but you DO get to go for your PhD once the finish line is either reached or within sight. That means all CCs paid off, cars paid off, other degrees close to paid off. Get a firm commitment from him that you can take out loans to go back for this degree, in time and when you are ready, and then you can slow down your career for a few years and switch to a job that is compatible with you doctoral studies.\n\nAs for all that travelling you wanted to do, it does not sound compatible with your academic goals. If you forget about the PhD, you could pay off your debts in the next few years even if you do some travelling.

This also assumes the PHD is totally free and you're only calculating the opportunity cost.", "First, do not get into any debt you cannot afford on the assumption it will be forgiven at some future date. You have absolutely no idea if that would happen.\n\nWhether or not you get a PhD is entirely up to you. You said you will make $200,000. Is this based on evidence of the current job market of people with this degree? The only reason I ask is that there are degrees out there that have no market value, yet are incredibly expensive. As long as this degree will increase your future earning potential, then it is a benefit.\n\nSince I\u2019ve been married awhile, I\u2019m going to give you this advice. It\u2019s good to have your own separate interests as a married couple. However, it is very difficult for a marriage to survive unless both partners agree, from the start, about:\n1. Whether or not to have kids\n2. Religion (each can\u2019t have different religions but strong opinions that the kids need to follow their own faith, or one strongly religious and one atheist, etc)\n3. Politics (this is becoming a really contentious issue. If you\u2019re not on the same page, are you guys going to fight every presidential election and every time laws pass you disagree with?)\n4. Money (if you\u2019re not on the same page about financial goals, budgets, and spending, you are going to fight a lot)\n\nTake, for example, having kids. If neither of you want kids, then this isn\u2019t an issue. If one of you does, however, please understand that an OB will label any pregnant woman 35 or older as \u201cgeriatric.\u201d That\u2019s when they begin to order additional tests and ultra sounds.I thought it was 40 and older, and I was shocked to be labeled a geriatric pregnancy. I was also shocked that genetic problems begin to arise at 35 and up, not 40 like I thought. Luckily everything was okay, but I did wish I\u2019d started sooner. You\u2019re 33. If having kids is one of your goals, then there is a price in delaying marriage, and having more trips before you begin even trying to have children. However, if you don\u2019t want kids, then that biological time constraint is not a concern. What you will find, however, is that if this relationship doesn\u2019t work out, most good men your age who want to get married, have gotten married. What\u2019s left are those who are mostly divorced or never committed. It gets harder to find a life partner, whether you get married or not. This also comes into play if you decide he is not right for you. Spending time with the wrong person means you are wasting time when the right person is out there. I am not advocating you end the relationship. Just that time is fleeting, and precious, and we all think we have all the time in the world, until we don\u2019t. \n\nNow, on to the budgeting. One of the first millionaire couples I knew were in their 60s, both retired teachers. They lived frugally while they both worked and raised a family. Then they retired early, had no mortgage, were debt free, and they travelled the world, carefree, while many their age worried over never being able to afford retirement. I went on a sailing trip in the French Caribbean, with a group of people, them included, and had a fantastic time. Being debt free at any age removes significant stress. There needs to be a balance between enjoying your life, and staying out of crushing debt.\n\nDo you expect your fianc\u00e9 to help make your student loan payments after you are married? Will he pay all your bills while you are getting that PhD and not working? You are in debt equivalent to a mortgage, possibly doubling that debt with a PhD. I hope you\u2019re right about your future earning potential. If you expect another person to help,pay your bills, then you need to do all you can to contribute, and minimize adding to that debt. If the PhD is critical to your future career,then you can help by not incurring additional debt from unnecessary travel, and get a second job before your PhD program starts. Right now, one of you has a plan for removing debt, while the other has a plan to add as much debt as possible as fast as possible, and is resentful about paying that down. This isn\u2019t going to work unless something changes.\n\nPlease also keep in mind that debt forgiveness isn\u2019t free. There\u2019s no magic money tree that paid for it. More money wasn\u2019t printed. Taxpayers paid for it. Tradespeople will pay for your degree. Small business owners with a tiny profit margin will pay for it. People without degrees paid for your degree, but won\u2019t benefit from it. Personally, I feel that people who can afford it need to invest in themselves, rather than spend as much as possible because someone else will pay for it, perhaps struggling to do so. White collar workers need to pay for their own white collar degrees, instead of dumping that responsibility on others, and then profiting off that degree. If the government pays for a professional degree, then working at a low paying government job for enough years to pay that back should be required. If someone gets a taxpayer funded MD, for example, then they should have to work at least 5 years at reduced pay in a hospital in a poor, underfunded area.", "YTA  You can\u2019t afford to be a student anymore.  The numbers don\u2019t lie.", "*I (33F) and my fiance 35m have been engaged for about 2 years.  Recently, I have been pushing him about a date and he has been insistent that we should get our finances in order first- to him meaning debt free, including the wedding. (Of course he is willing to talk as much money as my Dad will give for it)   Meanwhile, I've been finishing my 2nd masters' and have been accepted into PhD program.  I also want to enjoy my early 30's by attending events and going on trips with our friends. Currently between student loans (125k), my car (25k) and credit cards (about 10k), I am in some pretty high debt but anticipate my salary to be around 200k in 3 years or double what he is currently bringing home.* \n\n*I feel like he is trying to hold me back from my dreams, WIBTA for not following his advice?* \n\nLet's talk about your debt. Debt can be a good thing for the right reasons, such as education or housing.\n\nYou currently have 125k in student loans. Have you looked at your loan agreements lately? When do you have to start paying them, what's the interest on them? You owe another 25k on a car note, not to mention 10k in credit cards. How much interest are you paying on each?\n\nYou think that your salary will be about 200k after you graduate-what if it's not? People have been advising others that tech and STEM and law are the way to go to guarantee high salaries after college and look at what is happening now- tech and STEM people are being laid off. The legal field had a glut of lawyers so there are not as many firms offering the big bucks or firms have to defer offering lawyers jobs. What happens if you don't make that salary? What happens if you make less or can't find a job? You will be adding more debt to your life so that means more/higher monthly payments. How much of your 'big' salary will be eaten up by you paying back your loans?\n\nDo not count on debt forgiveness or having a large salary to repay your loans. You might not get forgiveness or find a job that makes that much. Your repayment plan might eat up half or more than half of your salary. It's not just the loans but the interest as well which can be a real doozy. Can you afford to do most activities and go on trips with your friends? Do you currently have a job and have you begun to make payments on at least your car note and credit cards?  Do you have savings? You'll be 36 in three years- are you saving for retirement, do you have health insurance? Do you want kids, a house, the American Dream?\n\nYOU CURRENTLY CAN NOT AFFORD YOUR CURRENT LIFESTYLE. You need to start paying down the car note and credit cards so that you can tackle the loan payments when they come due. Your fianc\u00e9 is right to want to start your married life with as little debt as possible. You should both sit down with a financial advisor to get a more realistic picture of your debt, how much you will be adding to it by going to school and how you will be paying it off. You can't deal in what might happen (I'll be earning 200k in 3 years), you have to deal with todays reality. If you never make that much, how are you going to pay off these loans?", "YTA for the reasons that the top comments have already listed first and foremost.\n\nBut also\u2014that line at the end about thinking he\u2019s just intimidated by you having a PhD\u2026 get over yourself.

Him stringing you along because of debt isn't a sign of a healthy relationship. As long as you're both on board with a plan, and you stick to it, marriage shouldn't be off the table. \n\nYTA for minimizing his hard work and discipline to set you up as a couple.

If he did all of this out of love, only to learn that the reinforcements aren't coming until you're finished with your 4th degree, that would be incredibly disappointing. Put yourself in his shoes, what he did was not fun. \n\nIf you compromise and say that you want to finish your PhD, but you've laid out your projected income and a plan to aggressively attack your debt together, I'm sure he'd be fine with that.
