You have 2 masters and are still not trying to get into the job market. Why on earth do you have a 25k loan for a car? If you don\u2019t have serious income you need to get a used car. My car was 6k and it runs great. 10k in credit card dept is also quite a lot. I have no clue how you even have a limit that high considering you must not have much income.", "Honestly, I don't think your fiance's reaction comes from a place of jealousy or insecurity about not having a PhD himself. If there's a part of you that believes that then break up immediately because he is not worth it. What I think however, is that he wants to harvest the fruits of labor, while you're thinking about an expansion of the fruit fields.\n\nCommunication is key; he's your fiance and if he truly loves you he'll be willing to at least find a middle ground. Don't make any decisions without his approval, but be prepared to make decisions if he doesn't approve of anything.  Also question how certain you are about making more sacrifices before earning an income.

At this point, they seem to be diametrically opposed.\n\nYou want to prioritize your education, knowing that there's a financial payoff in the future. But to play devil's advocate...is the payoff for the PhD that much greater than the payoff for the two masters? Is there a way to do your PhD part time while working? Because you are piling on the debt, and that will limit your life choices moving forward. It will affect when you can buy a house and what kind of house you can buy, because there is a maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have. Right now, you'd be relying on your  fiance's minimal/no debt to offset your massive debt.\n\nYour fiance has made some massive sacrifices to pay down his debts fast. He wants to pay cash for a wedding, and he's not interested in subsidizing your loans. Even if he's not paying them directly, I'm assuming he's paying for more of your joint lifestyle than you are. That will continue for years until you pay down your debts. But, he also won't give you a date for a wedding, which can be interpreted as a sign that he's not ready for that final commitment. Which, if he's not, he shouldn't be leading you on and should break up so you both can move on and find more suitable partners.\n\nI would highly advise you two to sit down and talk about where each of you sees your life in five years.

Counselling would probably help. Also, it will help to do some financial projections for your PhD-- I don't imagine you'd get further in debt, just be unable to pay down your current debt?

You should be able to live your life and have fun as you want to, because as you said you'll eventually get a really good paying job in order to pay things off. There's no problem in him getting a jump start on paying off his loans, but he shouldn't expect the same timeline from you. As you mentioned, you said you both agreed to paying them off, so I think this is something you'd do anyways. Just cause it's not on his time doesn't mean you won't do it, and doesn't mean you shouldn't do other things because of it. Honestly, if he ended up making a million dollars a year he could still feel financially unstable in certain ways. I don't think there's ever a \"perfect time\" to feel financially stable enough to be like okay \\*now\\* is wedding time.

Let's just say it never got to that point, because I just kept waiting and waiting. Overall, I say do what makes you happy- go out with friends, have fun, and PURSUE THAT CAREER.

My cousin was in a situation with a partner like this.\n\nYou've pledged to marry someone who has a totally different idea about resources and money.\n\nTo be honest, I hope the guy is planning to sign a prenup with you and assert strong boundaries about finances.\n\nYour continual financial choices could put his ability to pay for your future household in strong jeopardy, if you two even make to a wedding and marriage.\n\nSo, anyway, you're sitting here telling us:\n\n1. You keep 10k in credit card debt. Did you pay for your living expenses this way while doing your 2 graduate degrees? Or are you dropping 5k each year on trips to Spain with your girlfriends?\n2. You've amassed 125k in student loans. If your behavior has not been to seek out financial aid, fellowships, and cheaper education alternatives, your husband is probably panicking that you will continue the lap around the Monopoly board onto another financially ruinous square...like agreeing to do an unfunded PhD.\n3. You took out a 25k loan for a car. You mentioned that your dad will foot the bill for a wedding. Given your likely credit profile, did your Dad also co-sign for this? Did you make a substantial down payment? Or, did you buy a 30-40k car because you're the type of person who is not OK with driving a used Toyota Corolla? Is your fiance supposed to foot the repair bills on the car that you can't afford?\n4. You've spent years in school studying, instead of bringing in income. Will you expect your husband to provide for all of your seemingly upper middle-class material wants, as you continue to bring in zero or insignificant income for the next 5-10 years?\n5. You're planning to spend more years in a PhD program and haven't once mentioned assistantships, tuition waivers, or fellowships. Have you not thought about the financial side of this? Also, is your husband OK if you're spending 40-60 hours a week reading, working, and researching, along with all of the stress? I just finished a PhD. I have less hair, and some of it is now gray. Oh, and I read so much that I lost visual acuity.\n6. You want to spend more money on trips, adventures, and fun times with friends in your 30s. So, you've been doing this throughout your 20s, too? Were your parents financing this? Do you now expect your fiance to finance your lifestyle? Or will this be dad loans, on top of your high interest credit card debts?\n7. You're hoping that student loan forgiveness in 10+ years will wipe the slate clean, after paying interest on a 125k+ principal that's likely accruing unsubsidized interest. Student loan forgiveness has been changed, gutted, and backtracked so many times over the past few years. Nearly all of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness-eligible jobs will not be paying you 200k immediately after graduation. In fact, the federal government's salary schedule only goes that high for the most experienced executives with decades of experience. Going to loan forgiveness route will mean that you accept a job with mediocre pay for 10+ years making income-based repayment on your federal loans, while your private loans are still due. Unless the 125k is all federal loans, your fiance or your dad are also going to be roped into paying this for you.\n8. Your future husband will be bringing in around 100k to support the household, while your 3-7+ PhD years will bring in 30-40k annually, at best. If he's directly telling you that he's not OK with this, then you may consider other options. For example, working full-time in a job that will pay for you to complete a PhD part-time.\n9. Your fiancee has made clear his financial priorities. If you're going to do this with him in the picture and expect him to legally entangle himself with you and your six-figure liabilities in a marriage, then may God help your fiancee.\n10. Your fiancee sounds like he owns the majority of assets and will probably continue to be the primary breadwinner as you do a PhD. Thus, when one adds the lifestyle mismatch and PhD strain onto the financial disagreements, divorce is a possible outcome. If this does happen, he will likely be on the hook for alimony and giving you half of his stuff. You've spent your 20s spending yourself deep into the red and earning much less than you could have. You will continue this trend into your 30s. You're setting up your future husband for a potentially ruinous family court outcome, but that might not matter to you anyway.\n11. You're projecting a 200k salary after finishing your PhD. I just finished a PhD in a field with a favorable labor market. I can tell you with certainty that almost nobody, not even the MD-PhDs who go into assistant professorships at R1s in high cost of living cities, makes that much money. Some people with niche skills in biotech, fancy math, or computer science can make or exceed that.  Also, see point 7. If you're angling for a clean slate with loan forgiveness, you're not going to make 200k in those jobs.\n\nI'm bursting your bubble here in support of your fiancee, primarily. If you're going to do the PhD and expect him to foot the bills for your lifestyle, then consider the extent to which you actually value your partnership and love him. It sounds like he has already been pretty generous towards you.", "YTA based on the info so far, if having a phd and 2 masters is so lucrative in your field an employer would already be trying to poach you and offering to pay. You are also practically middle aged already and if you haven\u2019t started a pension pot by 35 it is going to be so hard to get set up for retirement even if you become a high earner.\nWithout experience in an actual workplace as an employee you may struggle to even get a job outside academia.\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds like he is a bad fit for you and has gone down an internet rabbit hole with his extreme frugality, I wouldn\u2019t stay with him myself. \nGet a job with a company who will fund your PHD or do it part time.", "This. There\u2019s a huge difference in risk tolerances. If OP stays engaged, it would probably be prudent to postpone the marriage until after Phd graduation.\n\nI will say that Phd program intensity tends to be incompatible with the enjoyment of attending events and cool trips with friends.\n\nI have to doubt the Fianc\u00e9 is jealous OP would have a Phd while he has a master\u2019s. Fianc\u00e9 is probably crushed his debt free dual income power couple dream is getting smothered by the prospect of still more years of mostly one income supporting a largely dependent and indebted partner.\n\nThey are charting incompatible paths.I hope the Fianc\u00e9 has the backbone to escape if OP commits to yet more (probably full time) education and debt. This relationship could survive as an engagement, but marriage should be off the table if they are this far apart.", "Also, how is she going to complete a phd in 3 years? Most people I know struggle to even complete one in 5 years", "Ditto. YTA. Just wracking up debt that\u2019ll never be paid off. Even paying it off in the late 30s is beyond hopeful. She\u2019ll be 36/37 before completing her phd, and the debt could balloon to who knows how much. I also don\u2019t get the feeling she\u2019ll commit much to paying off the debt, and instead travel and stuff.", "Ditto, in my profession at Masters degree didn't equate to more money.  Instead, I spent two years is school on loans when I could have been earning money.", "I disagree with you overall and think OP is NTA because she should be able to do as much school as she wants. \n\nI DO agree with you that the 200k thing is crazy unrealistic. I\u2019m starting a PhD this year and I don\u2019t anticipate making more than almost starvation wages from my teaching stipend for the next 5-6 years. \n\nIf she wants to do more school, she can do more school, but she needs to be way more honest with her fianc\u00e9 about what a third advanced degree is going to look like financially.", "Question:  has OP actually worked in her field?  Or, just been a perpetual student?  I ask because a PhD oftentimes makes it more difficult to get a job (unless it\u2019s in academia (which doesn\u2019t pay much initially)).", "it's a LOT of debt!  I cannot fathom spending freely on events and friend trips with that kind of debt amassing, every purchase would be something I have to convince myself to do \n\nYWBTA for expecting anyone to burden themselves with your truly outstanding debt in legal matrimony.  either marriage or the phd have to wait.", "Easy to generalize.", "I get his view in a way, 2 masters and agreeing to do a PhD program while he's working to be comfortable, and secure. They may just not be compatible.", "You think she must be beholden to a fanatic BOYFRIEND's devotion to Dave Ramsay? \n\nYou've lost it.", "OP\u2019s finishing a second master\u2019s. Some jobs do require doctoral level education, but a PhD\u2026 really? There are good jobs that require PhDs, but the markets for those fields tend to be volatile or allow for entry with a master\u2019s.\n\nSmells like a career student planning to be dependent on their spouses for at least the next 3 to 8 years. Few PhD students complete their degree including dissertation defense within the advertised timeline in the course catalog and marketing material\u2026 \ud83d\udea9", "She has 2 masters degrees and 125k alone in student debt lmao she has gone to school and then some.", "She wants to get married which makes her debt into his debt.", "I would have believed her timeline if she said DPhil. I suppose it\u2019s possible OP is just really confident that she can pass her quals without taking any coursework (seeing as most doctoral students in the US come straight from undergrad, whereas OP has two masters) and has a good idea for a fast/easy dissertation. I only personally know one person who finished their PhD in four years - everyone else took 5-7. Three years is just such a wildly fast expectation.", "I guess she is hoping that two masters gives her a little advantage.\n\nPeople coming from undergrad often have a very slow year 1 to a PhD while people coming in from masters are much better at hitting the ground running usually.", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the program where she finished her masters and they are counting the masters as the first two years of the PhD", "I had the same question. Possible exceptions for CS, math, or some other hard sciences (not all for sure!) - but those jobs are still very competitive. Also, a Masters would be sufficient for plenty of those (engineering, data science, etc).", "Yes I agree but they could still make it work if they communicate about it properly and if OP is sure about the job that she'll eventually get. Compatibility consists of more areas than one. Some PhD programs can be done while partially working and earning some sort in come. They'll have to find a middle ground or at least perspective on something or else this will not work out for them.", "I don\u2019t care about Dave Ramsey. At what point is it fair to say hey you\u2019re 33 with 2 Masters and a lot of debt - this may not be a good idea?", "Some people use a master's degree as a bridge to their PhD due to competativeness or to ensure they get into the best program.\n\nYou smell career student. Odd, as I'm smelling a woman entering a male-dominated career field and wanting the best leg up she can get because she's gonna need it.", "Not necessarily, that's a choice that they will make. I get where you are coming from but some choose to keep the loans they come into marriage with separated and some don't. I mean take buying cars for example, If you and your s/o get a car at the same time, chances are you'll be paying for your own cars. But at the end of the day it is a choice. And like i said their debt is their own responsibility, if they choose to share it they can.", "Being that sure about a job she might get after completing PhD is a lot of risk for even more debt.\n\nBut more  info is needed, what type of career is being looked at. How much work experience does she have. \n\nWhat\u2019s the job placement rate of these programs and how likely is she to finish.\n\nSeems pretty irresponsible to me to take on even more debt with the mindset that you are guaranteed an income in 3 years. When that\u2019s not at all how it works.", "If you are getting your PhD in machine learning or data science you say hello to mid 6 figures in tech. \n\nWhich sounds like a great idea to me.  I would love to make 400k a year in comp/bonus/rsus.", "Is pretty presumptive to assume negative context about OP. Do you even know her field of study? Do you know HER personal goals? Maybe she has something specific she is looking to achieve personally. It's not up to you to pick that for her. \n\nThis relationship is bad for both of them because the answers to those questions for the two of them are badly incompatible. Neither of them is inherently an asshole for wanting something different.", "Those kinds of jobs\u2026 accessible with two master\u2019s and some research publications\u2026 A PhD is not an automatic golden ticket", "From what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s around 200 max with the caveat the want a few years experience. I\u2019d be surprised if op has much experience based on her post.", "Except for very niche positions, those jobs are open to individuals without a PHD (heck, depending on experience and employer might not even need a Masters).\n\nFor the niche fields, where a PHD is absolutely required, it\u2019s competitive and OP should not be counting on that salary as a guarantee.", "I agree and would love to know their field of study.", "That would be for base. Add stock on top and you are easily in mid 6s. But agree, not for entry level and PhD would not be required in the majority of cases (publishing would help a lot though, some patents, etc)", "This exactly.  Every tech company I have worked for in the last 10 years has at least 2 of these roles and a standing directive to hire anyone else with those qualifications because they are unicorns.\n\nSilicon valley startups love phds."]}
