We\u2019re both pretty average in weight but she wants to become a model & apparently has a weight requirement she has to meet before they can hire her. \n\nShe has been begging me to start eating super clean & working out almost daily with her.  I told her i can go to the gym with her more frequently but I already eat clean besides desserts and don\u2019t really feel like changing it. \n\nShe went on about how I\u2019m not a supportive friend and forcing her to do this on her own would jeopardize her career as a model. After what feels like forever of begging I decided I\u2019d do it with her for a week and that\u2019s all I promised. She\u2019s trying to do it for at least 2 months straight without \u201ccheat days\u201d \n\n\nIt\u2019s been a week! Thank goodness I thought lol, I bought myself a beautiful delicious piece of chocolate cake.. I specifically got a piece because I didn\u2019t want to tempt her.  I was hoping to finish it before she came home but she walked in on me eating it & freaked out on me. \n\nTold me I was a massive AH, that I was the worst friend and how I\u2019m jealous of her career and want to take such great opportunity from her. She stormed off & stayed with her boyfriends last night...  I got a text from him and a few of our friends saying how unsupportive that was. Not sure what she told them but i think they are all ridiculous for calling me unsupportive over a damn cake. \n\nI literally worked out with her everyday & stopped eating dessert for her lol not to mention her tossing out anything \u201csweet\u201d from our kitchen without asking me\u2026 things I bought \n\nAnywho, petty old me decided to go shopping today and bought all my favorite deserts.  She freaked out even more when she came home and said I was awful for getting deserts rather than apologizing.  She left\u2026 again.

You worked out with her, that's supportive enough.  She's the AH for throwing out your food without you knowing.", "NTA. You were clear about your limits up front. She is the type of friend who will blame you either way. Dammed if you don\u2019t. Dammed if you do, but without chocolate.", "NTA. You roommate needs a reality check.", "NTA. If she has no self control, she may be getting into the wrong industry. It\u2019s ridiculous to blame you for her own weaknesses and shortcomings.", "NTA\n\nOh how do I applaud your pettiness!!!!\n\nYeah you were a good friend going to the gym with her and if she asked that you avoid eating the good stuff around her then sure that\u2019s fair. But to ask you to stop completely and throw away your food at the same time? Nahhhhhh. \n\nYou go OP.", "NTA. \n\nSo in order to support her you can't eat differently?! That makes no sense. You can still support her desires and eat your cake.", "NTA New Year, New You, New Roommate!", "NTA \n\nHer body and diet and her dedication to it are all on her. It\u2019s her choice and it\u2019s her responsibility. Expecting everyone else around her to conform to her lifestyle choices because she lacks the willpower to stick to it on her own when temptations lurk is inappropriate and irresponsible, and extremely unfair and ridiculous. \n\nShe is the only one responsible for what she puts in her mouth and does to her body. No one else is accountable for that.  You can be a support system in many ways without having to do the extreme diet and exercise plan she wants to do for her body and her career path. It\u2019s extremely self centered and entitled of her to expect you to be all In or be the AH for anything less. Not to mention her guilt trip and forcing her will is manipulation, which is a form of emotional abuse. She\u2019s an abuser. \nShe\u2019s the AH here. Not you. \n\nMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky and she\u2019ll stay at her bf\u2019s.", "NTA Well at least she's getting extra exercise with all the flouncing. And fretting.\nMost diet and exercise regimes have cheat days in them because if you do backslide, then not all is lost and hyper fixation on clean living can be mentally unhealthy. Two months is a long time for total denial.\nYou made an effort not to expose her to the naughty stuff. She needs to rely on herself more.", "NTA. She shouldn't be relying on anyone to go on her weight loss journey with her. To say you're not being supportive because you didn't want to do it is absolutely wrong and irrational. That was clearly her way of manipulating you into it. \n\nEat/work out how you want. If that's a problem for her, then she can deal with it solo. You don't need to be part of this drama. Either her friends are just as delusional as she is, or she has painted a very different story from reality.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is using you like a motivational crutch? \n\nWhy doesn't her BF go workout with her everyday?", "NTA. Have your cake and eat it in front of her!", "NTA.  Just because you don't want to starve yourself to meet an arbitrary standard, and she has no will to resist the siren song of dessert.", "NTA. She asked you to do it and you agreed to work out, but you\u2019re happy with your eating habits. She harassed you into submitting to what she wanted. She didn\u2019t respect your wants or needs at all. How you eat and exercise literally can not physically effect her. All this says is she doesn\u2019t have self control or will power to say no or stick to her guns. That is not your fault.", "NTA. \n\nSlash, lol, seriously? She needs to grow up and learn to be her own person.", "NTA. She needs therapy.", "NTA. Not even close. Are all her friends texting you changing their diets and working out with her? I doubt it. \n\nYou\u2019ve already been very supportive and clearly defined your boundaries. I would strongly urge you not to apologize. When someone makes you feel like an asshole for having boundaries and repeatedly tries to violate those boundaries, apologizing just gives them the fuel to keep taking advantage.", "My boss is always on some diet or another. She\u2019ll see me eating something and complain that I\u2019m tempting her. She\u2019s not really serious. I have a huge issue with diets. Moderation is key. If any diet makes you hate anyone around you that isn\u2019t also doing exactly the same as you, it\u2019s massively unhealthy. I\u2019m happy with my body. Took ages to be able to say that. I\u2019m not going to avoid the things I love because someone else isn\u2019t. She needs to grow up. If her desire to be a model means she has to be this miserable, perhaps it\u2019s not the career for her. \n\nNTA\nHave some extra cake for me!", "You know she\u2019s a fucking nut, right? If your roommate can\u2019t be a model without YOU starving yourself and you\u2019re questioning whether you\u2019re TA, it\u2019s past time to be done with this person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But seriously... as much as I hate to be unsupportive of the roommate's Rah-Rah/Gi-Go, \"new me\"  attitude, anyone who's experienced the phenomenon knows that that initial phase generally doesn't last forever\n\nI agree that OP is being reasonably supportive with her willingness to work out with the roommate. Likewise, she cannot be expected to delve into this obsessive new behavior just because the roommate is. But maybe, just for a month or so\u2014just until the glow wears off\u2014maybe OP could enjoy her treats somewhere out of sight", "NTA.

Probably not, just putting it all on you to suffer while they get to live as they want.

Let\u2019s put this into real dietary needs and not diet whims. My partner is T1 diabetic. Can eat anything but shooting up insulin for that extra bit of cake In between meals is something he\u2019s said he doesn\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s also not the greatest way to manage BG. That won\u2019t stop me buying a cake if we call into a coffee shop mid afternoon. He\u2019ll take a coffee and have sweetener so he doesn\u2019t need insulin and I\u2019ll have tea and cake. Does he accuse me of not being supportive to his health needs? Absolutely not. I give him support in other practical ways as you did with your friend by going to the gym with her. He sees that we aren\u2019t all the same and if I want to eat that cake (cake is life) than that\u2019s my choice and it shouldn\u2019t impact him. \n\nEnjoy your desserts.", "\"I'm sorry we're not fucking each other nearly enough to share this much of our lives.\"", "NTS.

Tell her you can live your life anyway you want and in the style that suits your needs and wants!  Also, please block her annoying flying monkeys!!

You can be supportive while still eating chocolate yourself.

Isn't that like a decade late already?", "This. I was ready to say \u2018but OP is not eating cake AT her roommate\u2019 when I read on and found that now, she does - but if this girl wants to live in a world without carbs, she needs to move to a place of her own and give away her TV. \n\nAlso, I worry that someone is exploiting roommate\u2019s dreams. It maaay be possible for a college student to break into modelling, but it\u2019s not likely, and far less common than someone trying to a) get her to pay for the \u2018necessary portfolio\u2019 or b) trying to get her to do nudes.", "NTA, and most modeling agencies look at a 23 year old woman trying to break into the industry as too old. Not all, but most. Good luck to her, though, I guess", "NTA her diet, her food. Your diet, your food. She has no right to ask you not to eat dessert. That said purposely eating dessert in front of her would be a duck move. Don\u2019t taunt her with it.", "Your roommate is abusive and entitled.  She can have cake and anything else.  Tell her to get some education on nutrition and coping mechanisms.\n\nFor example.  After 3 bites of something sweet (cake) your mind adapts and you are eating mindlessly.  Think about a donut\u2026the first bite is amazing\u2026but after that are you really enjoying or going after the sugar high.\n\nAlso college age is not the time to begin modeling.\nMore like 14-16. Sound strange-hopefully not a nude or scam agency who is promising her the moon", "oh man if a roommate threw out my food they would be looking for a new roommate and I would let EVERY mutual acquaintance know why they couldn't be trusted to share a living space. NTA, you went above and beyond.", "NTA. \n\nForcing her to do something she is choosing?\n\nExpecting others to exercise her own control for her that she cannot (will not) exercise herself?\n\nThrowing your food out? During a cost of living crisis? That shit costs money!\n\nAccusing you of being jealous of her career? What career??? Typical egotistical person who applauds themselves before they've achieved anything. \n\nDo you see how ridiculous these things are? You are NTA. \n\nShe's lucky you've been as supportive and tolerant as you have been. Why don't her boyfriend and other friends go to the gym with her? \n\nShe is literally doing transference and projection here. Making you responsible for her because she knows she cannot do it herself and then accusing you of her own lack of support for herself.

Christmas and keto are not a match made in heaven. Nor is living by the beach with the smell of burgers and onions wafting and hot cinnamon sugared doughnuts!

You don\u2019t have to do anything to help her. You were thoughtful and got one piece of cake and tried to finish it before she got home. So she wants your help to become a model, how much of her modeling salary would you get for helping her?", "Lol good luck making it as a model when you can\u2019t even maintain your own workout schedule and diet on your own. Weak minded folks blame others for their shortcomings.", "NTA you are not responsible for her diet or health x", "NTA no one can control your diet.\n\nIt\u2019s shocking how many people think being a roommate is being a life partner. \nAnd even a life partner shouldn\u2019t be controlling your diet", "NTA. Also she will never, ever be a model. 23 is waaaaaaay late to start. She might book a random minor gig or two but her shot at modeling being her main job that pays all the bills is long gone. Throwing out your food is bad enough, even worse that she threw it out over a sad delusion.", "The cake is a lie. Nta", "NTA.\n\nThis was almost exactly my behavior when I had an active ED, ana/orthorexia. Not saying she does, but I am saying that Jesus Christ, it is toxic behavior that can lead to a bad place FAST. Food is VERY emotional for people. It is not on you to manage her emotions around food. It's on her not to try to drag you into her \"journey\" and then be a dick about it."]}
