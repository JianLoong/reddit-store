I heard him pick up a video chat from his mum, who soon asked what that noise was. He told her that his flatmate (me) was just in the kitchen washing dishes. She very loudly and very excitedly asked if she could meet me, and Jack sent sorry/pleading eyes over my way. Reluctantly, I came over and said a quick hello - she was very lovely to be fair, and she was pleased to know that I also am here from overseas so can give Jack advice on visas etc. \n\nThe following Saturday, I got a WhatsApp message from an unknown number with an unknown country code asking if I know where Jack is as he's late for a call. Quickly put it together that it was his mum and went to go knock on his door. He opened, clearly just awoken, and I asked him why his mum has my number. He said sorry, his mum just wanted an emergency contact for him while he's overseas, and he hasn't made many friends nor found a job yet so didn't know who else to give. I said it was fine, my mum asked for the same when I moved away, but he should have asked first. OK, done deal. \n\nWell, mama bear wanted more of a penpal than an emergency contact.

I don't have, nor care to have, a relationship with him nor his mum. My partner, who lives with me, says it's completely harmless to entertain and I'd be hurting her feelings when she's \"clearly lonely\".

But something about this whole situation is making my Spidey senses tingle, and feels like mama bear is shopping for a girlfriend for her lonely son Jack who doesn't have many friends or a job, but does have a nice female roommate. \n\nJust something to think about... And if that *is* the case, there absolutely is harm in \"indulging\" her texts. \n\nEither way, I would send her back a polite but firm message. \n\n\"Jack let me know that you asked for my number for emergency purposes, and while I am fine with you having it for those situations, I'm not comfortable with the level of communication you're currently using it for.

If there's ever an emergency and OP needs to contact her, OP can un-block her.\n\nSubtlety isn't going to work here. She's not going to \"get\" hints or reduced/lengthened response time. Jack isn't going to be able to \"make her stop\". Even the statement I quoted above isn't going to get her to stop. Blocking is the only thing that will work.\n\nOP has a limited amount of mental and emotional bandwidth -- which should be allocated to things which are priorities for OP, not to an emotional vampire who is not part of OP's life and who has no concept of boundaries.", "Everyone you spoke to said youre a TA?  Stop telling ppl about this.

YOu want to keep an emergency line like a reasonable person, but if you answer back once ( please don't) she's got you.\n\ni'm Sure other comments have already jumped on this point, but give mama bear a new #, your partner's.

I\u2019d be like \u201cWhy is your mom messaging me about the weather and things we should do together? I thought I was just an emergency contact\u201d and sort of let him know a) his mom is messaging you unnecessarily and b) it bothers you. And like others, I\u2019d maybe mention having a partner, like saying yes, you went to that beach/whatever with your s/o last date night and see how that goes down. If the messaging continued I\u2019d def hit mute and wash your hands of it.", "NTA. They didnt even agree to be an emergency contact.  the flatmate gave the number to their mother without asking first.", "I have a theory that's a bit less forgiving to Jack... \n\nI strongly suspect he's closeted. He not-so-secretly invites men over at all sorts of weird hours and they go straight to his room, not knowing that my partner and I are very light sleepers and our walls are very thin. I haven't heard anything that necessarily confirms this, but enough to be suspicious. I've broached it before, to the effect of \"hey, did you have someone over last night? All good if so, just wasn't sure if I heard another voice while half asleep and thought I was going mad\". He'll say \"oh yeah, just a friend\". Which could be true, I guess. \n\nSo, if Jack is closeted, it wouldn't surprise me if he's heavily emphasizing any female \"prospects\" in his life, especially if he's worried his mum is on his tail.", "Bro I totally was wondering if she was shipping op and jack or maybe she thinks they are secretly dating", "I am a little sympathetic because my mum was like that too when I first moved away - anything to still feel connected. It took a long time and a lot of emotional leg work to cut that cord while still being responsible with her feelings. If this were like, literally any other situation I wouldn't hesitate. But I see my own mum in her :( \n\nAnd also, I feel like Jack needs to do the work with his mum that I did with mine, which is a big part of my frustration.", "NTA. Damn that\u2019s intrusive. Just because she\u2019s lonely does not give her the right to bother you. And your roommate never should\u2019ve given out your number."]}
