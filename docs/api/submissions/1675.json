You said you were paying the extra cost. 12 dollars isn't flaunting wealth by the way. If she doesn't have the money to allocate, she shouldn't be going to a restaurant.", "NTA. Paying the extra cost of your meal should have been the end of it. You're not an asshole for an occasional splurge, especially a signature dish at a trendy restaurant.", "Oh look at op here, he has an extra TWELVE dollars in his wallet! I bet he has subscriptions to Netflix AND disney+! No doubt when he goes to mcdonalds, he gets the LARGE fries! whats it like swimming in that money bin of yours, Scrooge McDuck? \n\nlol NTA", "NTA what the hell?? You wanted to try a dish and were willing to pay for the cost difference and that's somehow showing off? A whole TWELVE dollars? Good God, get new friends", "NTA. What a weird thing to make an issue out of.", "Nta order what you want. As long as you're not making everyone else pay, you do you. \n\nUnless it's like you got the tasting menu and they all had soup. Then maybe.

You did the right thing by addressing you would be ordering something more expensive and would make sure to cover for that.", "You're showing off your wealth with 12 dollars? She is a joke. Honestly splitting the bill can lead to issues I've always found. Easier to just all pay your own tickets and people can adjust as they need to so they can cover their own. She was being petty and rude. You handled it the correct way. It would have been bad if you'd just added to the cost and not said anything I think but you didn't. NTA.", "NTA Especially As they know you aren\u2019t able to get out much.And you paid for the difference!", "NTA. I think she is just sour about not making as much money as you.", "NTA \n\n$12 is petty \n\nThere must be better reasons why they're being mean girls to you. They sound like lousy friends, tbh", "NTA.  Eessh, I would not be calling this person a friend.  \"Throwing around\" $12.00 is hardly showing off.", "NTA if you were clear it was a dish you were really interested in and willing to pay the extra cost. It\u2019s not like you were bragging about having extra money or all the money in the world. Every person\u2019s financial situation is different and your friends sound immature for not realizing that", "NTA This can\u2019t go on forever.  Time to end this silly tradition or get separate checks.", "Someone who thinks paying an extra $12 is flaunting wealth just makes me sad. NTA. You were considerate of others.", "NTA and what a rubbish friend.  Splitting the bill is generally done when people order similar stuff it doesn't mean everyone has to order the same thing and if some skip desert then people pay for what they ordered.\n\nThe fact that your friend took issue with you ordering something \"fancy\" AND paying for it... says more about them than anything else.  What a wet blanket of a person to be around.", "NTA. This friend is making assumptions and clearly acting on her own insecurity and jealousy.  For all she knows, you specifically saved up *an extra 12 dollars* to splurge because it's a new restaurant with a well known signature dish. Also, it's not like you spent tons more than everyone else; we're talking 12 dollars. That's not exactly enough to warrant such a reaction. If you spent a hundred dollars more, maybe I would think \"eh, maybe they *are* flaunting their money\", but not 12 fucking dollars. This seems like a ridiculous overreaction on your friend's part.", "Nta. Far from it. You went out of your way to make sure you weren't sticking your friends with the extra cost of what you ordered.  And $12.00? That is her idea of flaunting wealth?", "NTA but maybe it\u2019s time to switch to paying your own bills", "NTA but why doesn't everyone just pay for their own food/drinks going forward? Seems like then it's less of an issue.", "NTA.  I thought you were  going  to say you always  just split evenly and this time you ordered something  expensive  and stuck the others with a bigger bill.\n\nYou pay for your stuff, NTA.  Friend has issues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
