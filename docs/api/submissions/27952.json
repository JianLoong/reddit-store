Realizing they were too small to fend for themselves, I decided to take them to a nearby wildlife rescue center.\n\nUpon arrival, I explained the situation to the staff member, who confirmed the species and informed me of a 20 euro charge for surrendering the birds. I was taken aback by this fee, as I hadn't heard of such a practice before. I questioned it, mentioning that their online page didn't mention a surrender fee. I then asked if they received state funding or were a private organization. The staff member clarified that it wasn't a surrender fee but a donation to cover the birds' food and care, and while they did receive state funding, donations were crucial due to the high number of animals they care for. They said they will not take the birds without me paying the fee.\n\nI declined to pay and said that they should write about the fee on their web page. As I started to leave with the birds, the staff member got kind of defensive. She expressed the importance of financial support, and asked me what I was going to do with the birds (but in a very condescending tone). She suggested these birds were now my responsibility and warned me that since I touched them, I could potentially be liable for wildlife disturbance charges. That made me mad since I felt like I didn't deserve this after trying to do a good thing. I told her to mind her own damn business and that I will find some other home for these birds. She told me to not come back to this place since apparently me telling her that ment I had an attitude. I left, called around and eventually found a local pet store willing to take in the birds.\n\nI feel quite unsettled about the entire situation. I recognize that the people working there are likely volunteers and facing financial challenges. However, I believe that I shouldn't be unexpectedly burdened with hidden fees while simply trying to do a good deed. It also seemed like the staff member's response was overly harsh.", "created_utc": 1696094469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wcfyh/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_this_fee_for/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
