One that i got in my senior year of high school and another after that. Not by any fault of my own of course. Let me explain. \n\nMy first car was given to me by an uncle as it was his old car. Specifically a 2005 mustang gt. He gave it to me as I had gotten my license a bit back and he knew how much I liked the car (also he got himself a newer car). Well I ended up only being able to drive the car a handful of times because my older sisters and mom would always use it themselves. \n\nNow I\u2019m in no way blaming my mom or sister, they both had unfortunate incidents in their cars (one spontaneously caught on fire and the other was t-boned by a drunk driver). I can\u2019t blame them for using the car to get to work and such. But however I CAN blame them for how they treated the car and me. \n\nThe car was in no way theirs except that they paid for gas yet they treated it as if they paid the bills for it. Despite me only driving a handful of times, I ended up paying for all the maintenance. New brake pads cause they ride the brakes, oil change, new air filter, I even almost bought new tires cause one would always go down during the week. Those all came out of my pockets even though I barely drove and they had more than enough money to afford it. This leads to the main problem, which was that they had no respect for the car. \n\nI was the only one cleaning, washing, and overall taking care of the car. It got to the point where my uncle had to take it back cause my sister was refusing to let me drive my own car, even to work and school. Because of this my uncle ended up buying me another car, this time a very old acura. \n\nNow this acura had a few issues, mainly terrible gas mileage. I of course still used it because free car. Up until my sisters ended up buying it out from under me by telling said uncle that I was fine with it being sold. Atp, I didn\u2019t care anymore because I was in college and didn\u2019t really need a car. Well now I\u2019m coming to the end of my college year and am in the market for another cash car. \n\nI don\u2019t want a repeat of the last 2 times so i plan on not allowing anybody minus myself and that uncle to drive my car anywhere. I\u2019ll ofc be paying for it (that uncle and my grandma pay for insurance but thats because they insisted) and want to make it a rule that nobody can drive, even if its just down the street because they smoke, leave trash, and more. That and i need the car to go see friends, go to work, and travel. But i know my sisters are probably gonna make it a big deal that I \u2018won\u2019t let them borrow the car for 5 minutes\u2019 and that I won\u2019t be allowing their children to ride either. \n\nSo reddit wibta for not letting my family (except a select few) drive my new car?", "created_utc": 1678012612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iu18o/wibta_for_not_letting_my_family_use_my_new_car/", "score": 794, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you a bot?", "/u/Longjuwertg is a bot that stole part of this comment /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iu18o/wibta_for_not_letting_my_family_use_my_new_car/jb0ezvy/", "Agreed but hey, if you got *any* car nerds in your friend groups it's like 30 minutes worth of work and 50$ worth in parts. Less if you're willing to rig it using parts from a scrap yard.", "NTA - not 'select' nobody !! don't be making grades of family members.  They can use the bus\n\nYou are 18 , use your words 'NO' , practice it and use it 'NO' SAY IT OUT LOUD 'NO'\n\nStop apologising for standing up for yourself - your sister and mother can say NO when you ask them to pay for upkeep of the car\n\nTry it again NO NONO NONONONONO", "NTA. Most people do not just grant access to their car because people are related. I don't even use my sons pickup to go to haul stuff across the yard without asking. It was my husband's and my pickup that we bought new and passed down. So our name is still on the title. But it is HIS truck. So I wouldn't use it without asking. Set your boundaries and know their behavior is why you set them", "NTA - I suggest you read the classic \"Tobacco Road\" and take note of what happens to the car.", "NTA\n\nJust be ready for the fall out.", "NTA. Maybe invest in a tracker for your car. Maybe a kill switch so they can't even start it. It's your car, not theirs.", "NTA. Most cars today use key fobs. A lot of used cars have them also. Some have the bonus feature of being able to use an app from the car makers that can be used to unlock, start or turn off your car. They offer other features as well. \n\nSince you have a concern about your sisters/mother using your car, looking at cars with feature may be a reasonable option for you. Without your phone, key fob, or passwords they unlock, start or driver your car. Some will even allow an alarm to be set if someone trys to start the car without the proper fob/phone.", "Twice, even. This would be a 3rd time", "You have to really trust those car nerds, because the worst that can happen with cutting the battery cable and splicing in a solenoid (heavy duty relay) is you could burn the car up with a bad installation.", "INFO \n\nIf you live at home and you're 18, how are you going to stop you family from using it?  Do you pay rent?  Does your family pay for the groceries?  Doesn't your family contribute to your life in other ways like cooking you dinner and paying the other bills?\n\nNTA, but I don't know how you're going to stand up against them unless you are a completely independent adult living somewhere else.  I mean, that's why I moved out at 17, to get away from the precedents families set and the power dynamics within them.", "NTA. You have very good reasons for not allowing any of them to drive your car. Do not let them. My husband used to have one of those steering wheel lock things that needed a key to open it, and the car couldn\u2019t be driven without it. Get one of those and keep the hey around your neck. And lock your door when you sleep so they can\u2019t come in and take it. If any of them take your car, report it as theft.", "NTA. Can\u2019t you buy a bar you put in the steering wheel so even if they have the keys they can\u2019t drive it?", "Take the keys with you, don't hide them.

Along with this relative generally just living out of the way so they can\u2019t just pull up whenever they so please so I know my car will be safe there", "My cousin was in a very abusive marriage years ago. Her dupe-controlling husband bought himself a manual transmission car so when he wanted her to be stranded, he would take her car and leave his. She didn\u2019t know how to drive a stick, and besides, he didn\u2019t leave the key.", "Glad you have a plan!", "NTA at all, I hope you can put your foot down and break this cycle of abuse on your cars by other people.", "Where I am, unless the insurance specifically states that a family member is a listed driver, no one at the same address can drive your car, or any accident or incident isn't covered.\n\nLaws vary though. Talk to the automobile insurer first, and then approach your family with that knowledge.\n\nAlso, being a non-smoker, it's really gross have smokers use your car.", "NTA.  Hide your keys.  But the mom and sister are going to pester you to death to drive it until they just wear you down.  So, maybe live with uncle or grandparents.", "Nta. No one is entitled to your car.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even let your uncle drive it, tbh. Personally, I would let your uncle know, if he gets upset about not being allowed to use your car (although he doesn\u2019t sound like he would, I don\u2019t know) that he perhaps bail your sisters up about their behaviour. I know it seems kind of elementary, but they, I\u2019m sorry op, don\u2019t seem to respect you at all. Maybe hearing how shitty their behaviour from someone else who\u2019s had to deal with the consequences of it, as they very clearly haven\u2019t, might help them pull their fucking heads in", "Yeah, that generally works, but my daughter took her manual to college in LA, where there is a lot of mandatory valet parking. Every single male valet will insist in front of a female driver that they know how to drive a stick. (They don\u2019t.) She even tested this a few times by having her boyfriend drive, and the valets just told him they couldn\u2019t drive stick and they\u2019d find the guy who could. So crazy. We had to replace the clutch on that car\u2014and I\u2019m not saying it was entirely due to the valets, but they were a contributing factor.", "Well, your sister deceived your uncle into selling your other car by saying you were ok with it. \n\nWhat keeps her from telling your uncle you said it was ok for him to lend her your spare key for the new one?"]}
