One that i got in my senior year of high school and another after that. Not by any fault of my own of course. Let me explain. \n\nMy first car was given to me by an uncle as it was his old car. Specifically a 2005 mustang gt. He gave it to me as I had gotten my license a bit back and he knew how much I liked the car (also he got himself a newer car). Well I ended up only being able to drive the car a handful of times because my older sisters and mom would always use it themselves. \n\nNow I\u2019m in no way blaming my mom or sister, they both had unfortunate incidents in their cars (one spontaneously caught on fire and the other was t-boned by a drunk driver). I can\u2019t blame them for using the car to get to work and such. But however I CAN blame them for how they treated the car and me. \n\nThe car was in no way theirs except that they paid for gas yet they treated it as if they paid the bills for it. Despite me only driving a handful of times, I ended up paying for all the maintenance. New brake pads cause they ride the brakes, oil change, new air filter, I even almost bought new tires cause one would always go down during the week. Those all came out of my pockets even though I barely drove and they had more than enough money to afford it. This leads to the main problem, which was that they had no respect for the car. \n\nI was the only one cleaning, washing, and overall taking care of the car. It got to the point where my uncle had to take it back cause my sister was refusing to let me drive my own car, even to work and school. Because of this my uncle ended up buying me another car, this time a very old acura. \n\nNow this acura had a few issues, mainly terrible gas mileage. I of course still used it because free car. Up until my sisters ended up buying it out from under me by telling said uncle that I was fine with it being sold. Atp, I didn\u2019t care anymore because I was in college and didn\u2019t really need a car. Well now I\u2019m coming to the end of my college year and am in the market for another cash car. \n\nI don\u2019t want a repeat of the last 2 times so i plan on not allowing anybody minus myself and that uncle to drive my car anywhere. I\u2019ll ofc be paying for it (that uncle and my grandma pay for insurance but thats because they insisted) and want to make it a rule that nobody can drive, even if its just down the street because they smoke, leave trash, and more. That and i need the car to go see friends, go to work, and travel. But i know my sisters are probably gonna make it a big deal that I \u2018won\u2019t let them borrow the car for 5 minutes\u2019 and that I won\u2019t be allowing their children to ride either. \n\nSo reddit wibta for not letting my family (except a select few) drive my new car?", "created_utc": 1678012612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iu18o/wibta_for_not_letting_my_family_use_my_new_car/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
