So am I the asshole for using my dinner plates to feed my cats and those dinner pates most likely being used by people after they've been cleaned and put away?\n\nEdit: Some responses to the comments\n\n1. To the people saying my friends reaction was a bit much. It was a bit unexpected, she's not really a germaphobe we used to live together before we moved to different areas. I do know she's from a family (and culture?) were pets aren't really a thing and if they are they don't belong inside. She is under stress than usual having moved to a new city for grad school I'm chalking that to maybe contributing to everything. This happened last night so rn I'm cool with her still being angry enough to not want to talk but yeah our group of friends that have told me what she told them are also thinking the whole thing is getting a bit blown out of proportion. \n\n2. To people suggesting I make some of the dinner plates cat exclusive you are most likely correct, I moved here a year ago got the cats 10 months ago and this was the first person to visit me so I've gotten very used to being the sole person. At this rate I'll wait for the college sales to start so I can grab those cheap plastic plates and my cats will stick with the nice plates lol since at this point I assume all 4 of my plates have been used by a cat.\n\n3. To the people saying I am lazy or cheap for not buying pet bowls, if you read the post I mentioned whisker safe dishes, I'll elaborate if there is any hint of a rim the cats will not eat, combine that with the fact that they need a raised whisker safe bowl as I stated originally, a plate is far cheaper for someone like me who's currently in grad school and operating on a tight budget.

Like there is no reason to share tableware with animals but you choose to. I don't even buy used dishes because I don't know what people did to them - see hoarder homes and homes filled with mold. If there was a worldwide dish shortage maybe, but you're doing it for no reason.", "NTA if you were feeding a Komodo Dragon off the same plates, I'd side eye you.

We refer to dogs as the pre-wash for most dishes. \n\nDishwashers are designed to disinfect dishes.

I mean, i get why someone who has an allergy would be concerned, but then i have friends with deadly food allergies that are fine as long as the dishes are washed in the dishwasher. \n\nSo this isn't an actual health concern, but more the concern of someone who probably doesn't have pets.

I'll even occasionally smell the plates, just to make sure - never a hint of cat food. You're good.", "YTA.  One more reason not to eat food from people with pets.  That is disgusting.  Pet food does not have the same cleanliness standards as human food.  Haven\u2019t you ever removed dishes from the dishwasher and later discovered food still stuck to them?  When cat food dries on a dish, it\u2019s like cement.  The dishwasher isn\u2019t getting all of that residue off.  \n\nYour friend is exactly right.  That is disgusting beyond words.  Barf!", "NTA.
