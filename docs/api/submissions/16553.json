They eat off regular appetizer plates that are exclusively for them raised up on little platforms. Does the same job as some of those fancy whisker safe bowls for a whole lot cheaper.\n\nOccasionally I will use regular dinner plates instead of the appetize plates for certain foods that the cats will push around and onto the floor if not on a larger plate. I will rinse off the plates and put them in the dishwasher. I always do a sanitary cycle and heat dry. After they're cleaned they go back into cabinet where I keep my plates. This means I or a guest could have used a plate that a cat ate off of at one point.\n\nI had a friend over for dinner and after we ate she did a quick apartment walk through and saw that the plates the cats were eating off of were from the same set as the ones we ate dinner from. She asked about it and I said the same as above, she called me disgusting and left. She won't talk to me and has told my other friends that I'm a health hazard and gross person.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with it, but who knows maybe this is crazy cat lady behavior. So am I the asshole for using my dinner plates to feed my cats and those dinner pates most likely being used by people after they've been cleaned and put away?\n\nEdit: Some responses to the comments\n\n1. To the people saying my friends reaction was a bit much. It was a bit unexpected, she's not really a germaphobe we used to live together before we moved to different areas. I do know she's from a family (and culture?) were pets aren't really a thing and if they are they don't belong inside. She is under stress than usual having moved to a new city for grad school I'm chalking that to maybe contributing to everything. This happened last night so rn I'm cool with her still being angry enough to not want to talk but yeah our group of friends that have told me what she told them are also thinking the whole thing is getting a bit blown out of proportion.\n2. To people suggesting I make some of the dinner plates cat exclusive you are most likely correct, I moved here a year ago got the cats 10 months ago and this was the first person to visit me so I've gotten very used to being the sole person. At this rate I'll wait for the college sales to start so I can grab those cheap plastic plates and my cats will stick with the nice plates lol since at this point I assume all 4 of my plates have been used by a cat.\n3. To the people saying I am lazy or cheap for not buying pet bowls, if you read the post I mentioned whisker safe dishes, I'll elaborate if there is any hint of a rim the cats will not eat, combine that with the fact that they need a raised whisker safe bowl as I stated originally, a plate is far cheaper for someone like me who's currently in grad school and operating on a tight budget.\n\nEdit 2: For people saying if I'm gonna use dinner plates for the cats regularly I should just but them... did you not see the word **occasionally**? To give you a number, looking at my budget tracker I have fed them off regular plates **10 times** which in the grand scheme of feeding them twice a day is pretty infrequent in my mind. However their cat only appetizer plates are going in the dishwasher too so I guess every cup, utensil, and bowl is no longer fit for humans to use according to some people in the comments.", "created_utc": 1683392418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139vkim/aita_for_feeding_my_cats_off_regular_plates_that/", "score": 756, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pet food does not have the same cleanliness standards as human food.  Haven\u2019t you ever removed dishes from the dishwasher and later discovered food still stuck to them?

She doesn\u2019t want to eat at your house cause she\u2019s not down with pets, that\u2019s on her. But some of us believe that soap and hot water actually do their job of removing germs so calling you unhygienic is really out of line.", "How very aristocats of you!", "Exactly. I just wouldn't eat at your home again and keep it to myself.", "Same I feed my dog food and then use the same fork to keep eating. Doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ll also let my dog lick my ice cream cone and continue eating it. He licks my face I love him. He\u2019s my family. If I didn\u2019t let him do these things it wouldn\u2019t feel right to me.", "Had to scroll way to far to find this.  So gross.", "Why would you side eye with a komodo dragon?", "This is an insane response.  A cat eating off a plate is not in any way analogous to eating something someone has shit on. Grow up.\n\nOP, NTA.", "Was it a gift from her MIL? I almost imagine her satisfaction every time her MIL visited her... \ud83d\ude00 \"My beloved dog should use the best dish i have! Thank you, MIL!\"", "Actually my moms MIL is one of the few people that my mom has never had anything bad to say about on that side of the family. According to my mom, she was the most kind person she ever knew\u2026 my mom took care of her both times she had breast cancer and still tells me about how she adored me because I was the first girl (she had 2 sons, 12 yrs apart with too many miscarriages in between), and how kind she was! The gift was from a coworker of my moms dad- Nortel- she loved to host dinner parties and such, so she was trying to be thoughtful but didn\u2019t realize that was never my mom, lol.", "I see people have actually already answered this, but yes, he got a bad case of feline acne on his chin which was not very comfortable for him.  It cleared up when we switched away from the plastic bowls at the recommendation from the vet.", "One 4th of July, family's at our parents' house, and I'm letting their dog lick some plates before I put them in the dishwasher, and my sister goes off on me, you know, disgusting! gross! etc, etc. She finally calms down and grabs a bowl that's sitting on the counter, pours out the water, and puts the potato salad in it, and huffs out.\nMom turns to me and says, \"should I have told her that was the dog's water bowl?\"", "My understanding about this was that it's not an allergy, it's that plastic dishes allow bacteria to grow more easily, and perhaps it's harder to kill them off or wash them off. I don't know that I got this from a reliable source though, so take it for what it's worth. Whatever the underlying cause, I had the same experience with my cats: plastic dishes = chin acne.\n\nAnd I ate off the same dishes as my cats all the time. I got small Corelle dishes - basically glass - and washed them in the dishwasher. Didn't bother keeping separate ones for cats.", "This is the only Correct Response in this thread", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense. If you can\u2019t trust a dishwasher to remove bacteria then you should never reuse any plates, bowls, cups. \n\nIf you think cats have special bacteria that can\u2019t be washed off like human bacteria they would still be the asshole since the actual cats dishes are washed sure with everything else according to OP. \n\nBut then if OP hand washed them separately they would still be an asshole as there\u2019s no way a sponge and tap water would clean off bacteria if a dishwasher couldn\u2019t and the sink and surrounding countertops would be contaminated.\n\nAre you posting from 2006? Where in the world is kmart still around?", "Most dishwashers at home are not very clean. Maybe 40-64\u00b0C. \n\nLetting your pet eat from dinner plates people uses is disgusting. \n\nYTA OP. \n\nYes it is crazy cat behavior. And I have a cat myself.", "Still the thought of it. If you shit on a plate and clean it with a bottle of bleach with a 1000 degree dishwasher, I still have a hard time eating off the plate. It not about the actually germs it just the idea is a turn off when eating.", "I wonder if that's it! In my culture we don't allow pets inside, I can't even imagine sharing a plate with pets. My kitty has her own old dented mixing bowl and soup mug for water. We don't have a dishwasher so it dries with all the our dishes. Also wouldn't think YTA- but i'd think its common curtesy  to use party plates and glasses for visitors in general.", "Yea it\u2019s wild to me ppl saying, well ppl put xyz in their mouths\u2026yes they chose to, OP made the decision.", "I wanted to upvote you but your comment is at 69 so I can\u2019t it\u2019s just too perfect.", "Actually I do. But I'm aware it's weird of me. I usually keep a plastic fork that I wash until it falls apart. But I do have a stainless one that I'm rarely likely to use myself that I also use for the cat. And dog. Even weirder is I would totally use normal dishes for them if needed and just wash them extra afterwards. Now if I could convince my cat to stop licking my nose...", "Yeah.. cant like nor dislike this.. I wished my cat was as attentive. Sauron's eye is almost always a bit crusty...", "A somewhat related note, but also not...I wash my dishes and cat dishes in the dishwasher together, high heat, etc (not because cat but just to get clean), and But all my undies I wash separately in one load apart from other clothes.....just me?!???", "And the asexual and the celibate women like nuns.", "And the women who have never had a sexual partner. Don't forget the aces.", "You could just go to a thrift store and buy a special fork instead of using the plastic one.  \n\nOP could also get some separate dishes from the thrift store for her cats... If she's running them through the dishwasher, from a germophobic, it's going to be okay.  OP's probably used those plates while she's had the flu, scratched her nose when taking them out of the dishwasher, and a zillion other germy things I might be more concerned about than cat tongue that's been cleaned and sanitized.", "Perhaps we should also count some bisexuals, straight women (perhaps those that have only been with men that were amab), and asexuals. Also, I am pretty sure that oral isn\u2019t something everyone would be into, even if they like aubergines", "Ummm I'd wash up without being asked that's just common courtesy and I'd expect the same from anyone I'm going down on", "Why? Do you imagine *all* of OP\u2019s friends are as dim as this one who doesn\u2019t seem to know that dishes can and should be washed between uses?\n\nLmao! It\u2019s not like the plates are being licked clean by the cat instead of being washed. What a ridiculous scenario to fault anyone over.", "No, she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s HER house. She doesn\u2019t need to set aside plates.", "Agreed. All the statistics and facts people are commenting, though make sense, no one really thinks about or they have the ability to fix before doing/using. My mom always asks for a cup of hot water to soak utensils in when we eat out. Or you have the option of asking for plastic ware. This was more out of pocket since you didn't tell your friend before she ate on the plates. If given the choice I would not have eaten off them either. Maybe give people the option instead of assuming they'd be ok with it.\n\nAdding that YTA because I forgot that part. But not a big one.", "This is so stupid. Cat food is not cum.", "You mean ouch\u00e9 lol", "I have cat plates and a cat fork \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut only because my cat is a special boi who can't eat properly, so when I found a plate that he can eat out of and not get food everywhere I bought a heap. He still sometimes drags pieces out of the bowl to 'kill' them, but it's less cleanup than before \ud83d\ude02", "lots of men are disgusting."]}
