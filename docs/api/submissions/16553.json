They eat off regular appetizer plates that are exclusively for them raised up on little platforms.

This means I or a guest could have used a plate that a cat ate off of at one point.\n\nI had a friend over for dinner and after we ate she did a quick apartment walk through and saw that the plates the cats were eating off of were from the same set as the ones we ate dinner from. She asked about it and I said the same as above, she called me disgusting and left. She won't talk to me and has told my other friends that I'm a health hazard and gross person.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with it, but who knows maybe this is crazy cat lady behavior. So am I the asshole for using my dinner plates to feed my cats and those dinner pates most likely being used by people after they've been cleaned and put away?\n\nEdit: Some responses to the comments\n\n1. To the people saying my friends reaction was a bit much. It was a bit unexpected, she's not really a germaphobe we used to live together before we moved to different areas. I do know she's from a family (and culture?) were pets aren't really a thing and if they are they don't belong inside. She is under stress than usual having moved to a new city for grad school I'm chalking that to maybe contributing to everything. This happened last night so rn I'm cool with her still being angry enough to not want to talk but yeah our group of friends that have told me what she told them are also thinking the whole thing is getting a bit blown out of proportion. \n\n2. To people suggesting I make some of the dinner plates cat exclusive you are most likely correct, I moved here a year ago got the cats 10 months ago and this was the first person to visit me so I've gotten very used to being the sole person. At this rate I'll wait for the college sales to start so I can grab those cheap plastic plates and my cats will stick with the nice plates lol since at this point I assume all 4 of my plates have been used by a cat.\n\n3. To the people saying I am lazy or cheap for not buying pet bowls, if you read the post I mentioned whisker safe dishes, I'll elaborate if there is any hint of a rim the cats will not eat, combine that with the fact that they need a raised whisker safe bowl as I stated originally, a plate is far cheaper for someone like me who's currently in grad school and operating on a tight budget.

She didn't have to be so weird to everybody about it.\n\nDoes she also freak out because you don't have a special set of knives that you use only for cutting up raw meat and never for anything else?  Or because every spoon in your house has been in A HUMAN MOUTH for MULTIPLE TIMES?  (/sarcasm)", "NTA, sounds like your friend might be a germaphobe because wow that does not seem like an appropriate reaction. She Won\u2019t talk to you??? Weird.", "The dishwasher will do no less a good job cleaning the plates whether a human or a cat last used them.\n\nNTA", "NTA. As long as the plates are cleaned after, what\u2019s the big deal? I\u2019ve fed my dog out of a mixing bowl, cleaned it, then made cookies with the same bowl a few days later. Can\u2019t tell the dog ate out of it. By her logic you should only be using disposable forks because someone had that fork in their mouths once. Mouths are gross, that\u2019s common knowledge. Doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s it is. If you can clean a fork and someone else uses it later, you can clean a plate an animal are off of.", "NTA - if you're cleaning the plates after use, it doesn't matter. \nI get that some people still might feel icky about it even knowing it's clean, but this is *your* place and *your* dishes. They are still cleaned, and someone feeling weird about it doesn't make you a health hazard.", "NTA, it's your house and your dinnerware.\n\nHowever: it's hardly difficult to set aside a couple of plates for cat use only. If you eventually have a roommate or even friends who dine with you often, then you probably should make that simple change.", "NTA\n\nYour kitchen sponge probably has more dangerous bacteria growing on it than whatever your cats just ate off of. A cat eating off of a plate isn't going to contaminate it in any way that washing it won't take care of.", "NTA. But some people do get the ick at that. I get it. \n\nBut your friend calling you a health hazard to others and avoiding you is uncalled for. Hopefully one of your other friends sets her straight.", "I think you may get mixed answers from cat people and non cat people lol. I'm going to say NTA because I have 4 furbabies and I'd be ok with using a plate they've used if it has been properly cleaned, like yours was. However, I personally wouldn't give those plates to guests because they may not be okay with it. But your friends reaction was a bit harsh!", "NTA - if the plate is washed afterwards, who the hell cares who eats off of it? A cat, a dog, your uncle Bob. Doesn't matter in the slightest.", "NTA, and many people do the same.   But UGH.  I'm not at all germ phobic and I have cats as well--they eat from their own dishes ONLY.", "I do the exact same thing. Your friend is a germaphobe, not your problem. NTA", "NTA. I have dogs and let my dogs eat off plates when I make them eggs or give them carrots or something. \n\nThe dishwasher cleanses it. Not a big deal.", "NTA.  I admit to being a \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d myself but it\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to be upset over this, especially if you\u2019re putting them in the dishwasher!\n\nI had a friend disgusted with me once because I let my cat lick some ice cream off my spoon.\n\nI just shrugged and told them it\u2019s none of their fucking business and if they no longer want to eat at my house, that\u2019s fine with me.", "NTA.

The plates are sanitary once they have been washed.", "NTA, that's a major overreaction. I mean does she realise that when she eats at a restaurant, that fork was probably in someone else's mouth maybe even just a few minutes ago? We clean things, they're clean.\n\nThat said, maybe it would be a good idea to just have separate plates for the cats. Maybe even swap the plates for something like a chopping board or some other large flat surface.\n\nObviously not a chopping board you use for chopping food. One just for them.", "NTA.  For all she knows the dinner plates she bought were packed in the box by a person that wipes their ass with their hand.  That is what proper cleaning and sanitizing is for.", "NTA but tbh this is really gross. I have a pet dog and do not allow her to share plates with me.", "YTA I am horrified pet owners would do this \ud83d\ude33", "What\u2019s the difference between raw meat and cat food on a plate?  Raw fish with skin still on? Raw chicken livers? Heck, my friends kid vomited on a plate and we scraped it of and ran it through the dishwasher.  Utensils have been in other peoples mouths.\n\nAnd to the poster that commented about stuck on food, I soak the plate and few ash it.  I don\u2019t want to use a dirty plate whether it\u2019s dried on filet mignon or cat food.", "NTA - It's your stuff, and if you want to use it that way you can.\n\nHowever, I do see where she is coming from. Even though I know there aren't actually any germs, the idea of eating of a plate a cat has eaten off makes me a little uncomfortable, and I would prefer not to eat off one. **But** her calling you 'a health hazard and gross' is not ok, it's unnecessary and rude.", "Personally, I would be grossed out by this in which it\u2019s just kinna icky to me (even though I know everything is clean) but I wouldn\u2019t say your a health hazard nor a gross person.  She went to far in telling other people that.", "YTA and a crazy cat lady as you stated.  Don\u2019t @ me, cat fans; OP posted on an AITA and is not looking for an echo chamber.", "YTA this is disgusting", "NTA.  I bought human plates for my cats that don't touch my cats' whiskers at all.", "She knows when she goes to restaurants that thousands of strangers previously drank from the same glass, right?", "Hmmmm, does she expect people to get new forks and spoons after someone else ate with them? \n\nNTA", "I would say NTA, however\u2026 just get some bowls for your cats. It\u2019s not an ass-hole thing to let your cats use the plates but you can\u2019t expect others to NOT find it weird. So why not just buy two bowls and be done with it. It\u2019s not that expensive.", "NTA. The plates are clean. That\u2019s all that matters. Who cares who (people) or what (cats) eats off the plates as long as they\u2019re clean and sanitary??", "NTA. We let our dogs lick the plates, then we run them through the dishwasher. They are cleaned and sanitized.", "NTA. I have a bunch of little china bowls I bought at a charity shop, perfect as cat bowls. Also perfect as ice-cream dishes. The cats don't mind that I sometimes use their bowls for ice-cream, as long as they are allowed to lick them clean before they go in the dishwasher.", "NTA but I would have specific plates for the cats to use", "human mouths can have ickier bacteria than cats (or dogs) in terms of infection - just clean the plates NTA", "I feed my dog off plates and bowls that people use.   Once they\u2019re run through the dishwasher, what difference does it make?", "ESH- And I am a pet owner, but I find it terribly gross. I would never let my dog use a piece of dinnerware or cutlery that humans do, disinfected or not. I wash his food/water bowls with his own sponge, in an empty sink. I love cats too, but I still hate seeing them on people\u2019s countertops, and I don\u2019t eat their food again if I witness it. \n\nThis comment section is being disingenuous af too. A human and a cat eating off a plate are 2 different things. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID, Friend is also an AH for calling you a health hazard and spreading the word in the town square. Simply saying \u201cI find that unforgivably gross\u201d in the moment and leaving would\u2019ve been plenty.\nEDIT - forgot ESH was an available ruling", "I'm not sure what everybody else is smoking but just because you are ok with something doesn't mean everybody else is. Speak to literally anybody outside of the internet and they will say it's gross to do what you do. Personally I wouldn't care all that much but I would think you were odd. I wouldn't invite a guest into my home and expect them to feel the same way. Just use a pet bowl like a normal person and stop being so lazy.", "YTA - It's gross. Like there is no reason to share tableware with animals but you choose to. I don't even buy used dishes because I don't know what people did to them - see hoarder homes and homes filled with mold. If there was a worldwide dish shortage maybe, but you're doing it for no reason.", "NTA if you were feeding a Komodo Dragon off the same plates, I'd side eye you.  The dishwasher will take care of any bacteria left from the cats just like it did after the friend transferred their bacteria to the plate they used.", "We've had pets my whole life. We refer to dogs as the pre-wash for most dishes. \n\nDishwashers are designed to disinfect dishes. And if you think human germs and dogs germs are different, or that dog saliva is some sort of contaminant, wow. I mean, i get why someone who has an allergy would be concerned, but then i have friends with deadly food allergies that are fine as long as the dishes are washed in the dishwasher. \n\nSo this isn't an actual health concern, but more the concern of someone who probably doesn't have pets. Or dishwasher. \n\nUmmm...NTA", "NTA. We have cats, and though we do have some cat-specific bowls, all the salad/side plates and shallow sauce dishes are human/cat interchangeable. We leave the dishwasher on \"pots and pans\" all the time and if anyone has been grossed out, they've never said anything. I'll even occasionally smell the plates, just to make sure - never a hint of cat food. You're good.", "YTA.  One more reason not to eat food from people with pets.  That is disgusting.  Pet food does not have the same cleanliness standards as human food.  Haven\u2019t you ever removed dishes from the dishwasher and later discovered food still stuck to them?  When cat food dries on a dish, it\u2019s like cement.  The dishwasher isn\u2019t getting all of that residue off.  \n\nYour friend is exactly right.  That is disgusting beyond words.  Barf!", "NTA.
