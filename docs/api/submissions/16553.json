She won't talk to me and has told my other friends that I'm a health hazard and gross person.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with it, but who knows maybe this is crazy cat lady behavior. So am I the asshole for using my dinner plates to feed my cats and those dinner pates most likely being used by people after they've been cleaned and put away?\n\nEdit: Some responses to the comments\n\n1. To the people saying my friends reaction was a bit much. It was a bit unexpected, she's not really a germaphobe we used to live together before we moved to different areas. I do know she's from a family (and culture?) were pets aren't really a thing and if they are they don't belong inside. She is under stress than usual having moved to a new city for grad school I'm chalking that to maybe contributing to everything. This happened last night so rn I'm cool with her still being angry enough to not want to talk but yeah our group of friends that have told me what she told them are also thinking the whole thing is getting a bit blown out of proportion. \n\n2. To people suggesting I make some of the dinner plates cat exclusive you are most likely correct, I moved here a year ago got the cats 10 months ago and this was the first person to visit me so I've gotten very used to being the sole person. At this rate I'll wait for the college sales to start so I can grab those cheap plastic plates and my cats will stick with the nice plates lol since at this point I assume all 4 of my plates have been used by a cat.\n\n3. To the people saying I am lazy or cheap for not buying pet bowls, if you read the post I mentioned whisker safe dishes, I'll elaborate if there is any hint of a rim the cats will not eat, combine that with the fact that they need a raised whisker safe bowl as I stated originally, a plate is far cheaper for someone like me who's currently in grad school and operating on a tight budget.

Like there is no reason to share tableware with animals but you choose to. I don't even buy used dishes because I don't know what people did to them - see hoarder homes and homes filled with mold. If there was a worldwide dish shortage maybe, but you're doing it for no reason.", "NTA if you were feeding a Komodo Dragon off the same plates, I'd side eye you.

We refer to dogs as the pre-wash for most dishes. \n\nDishwashers are designed to disinfect dishes.

I mean, i get why someone who has an allergy would be concerned, but then i have friends with deadly food allergies that are fine as long as the dishes are washed in the dishwasher. \n\nSo this isn't an actual health concern, but more the concern of someone who probably doesn't have pets.

I'll even occasionally smell the plates, just to make sure - never a hint of cat food. You're good.", "YTA.  One more reason not to eat food from people with pets.  That is disgusting.  Pet food does not have the same cleanliness standards as human food.  Haven\u2019t you ever removed dishes from the dishwasher and later discovered food still stuck to them?  When cat food dries on a dish, it\u2019s like cement.  The dishwasher isn\u2019t getting all of that residue off.  \n\nYour friend is exactly right.  That is disgusting beyond words.  Barf!", "NTA.

That is your cat's home. Her mouth on your forks is probably grosser than your cats mouths.", "Nta. I understand a bit of visceral disgust reaction, but their response is waaaayy overblown.", "NTA. I let my dog lick our plates before putting them in a dishwasher, which washes dishes and makes them clean. As long as they're clean, who cares who used them before.", "I literally do the same thing so imo nta", "NTA\n\nI use our small plates for the cats. They like them best and don't get whisker fatigue like they do from every cat dish I've ever gotten. \n\nThey're super convenient size tho. So we use them too. Obviously they get sanitized and clean...but my kitties are part of the family. Idgaf.\n\n...I mean people kiss their dogs on the mouth after they lick their balls, this is a bazillion times cleaner than that crap.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re going through a dishwasher, it\u2019s fine. I think some people just get the ick about stuff like this even though it\u2019s not really logical. She is an AH for talking shit to your friends about it.", "NTA", "This. How about eating at a restaurant, where you don't even know whose mouth the spoon's been in. \ud83d\ude40\n\n\nIt's washed, calm the eff down.\nNTA", "Yes. Plenty of my plates and bowls have had raw chicken and other raw meats in them at various times. That would definitely not be safe to eat on without a thorough washing, but I doubt anyone would think twice about it if they saw that in my kitchen. We\u2019ve also all had germy bathroom hands. Does that mean we can never touch food with our hands again? Soap is a thing. This is just silly.", "I have many utensils that have ended up on the floor at times too. Everything is washable!", "Love that. Now I need some gold trimmed saucers for mine \ud83d\ude02", "This is where I fall... ESH \n\nI have pets,  but strongly believe in keeping plates/spoons and slobber toys separate from the rest of the families stuff. It's gross to me mixing all that up\n\nBUT, the friend didn't need to kinda go nuclear informing other friends and being super judgmental. I probably just wouldn't eat there anymore \ud83e\udd37", "Just to be safe don\u2019t eat off of anything at someone\u2019s else house if they have pets. The cats, dogs, and people here use the same dishes and everything goes into the dishwasher and I know many people who do the same thing.", "Scotland and I do it sometimes if there's anything left after a meal that is dog friendly to eat. I rinse all dishes so there will be nothing on them, then shoved in the dishwasher which sanitizes.", "If you truly feel like that, I hope you only eat at home. There's many dog owners who will let their dogs lick their plates after they eat.", "Absolutely this!!!", "Right? That\u2019s more gross to me. Who knows where THOSE mouths have been \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s the eco-pre-rinse cycle, isn\u2019t it?", "I once came into the kitchen and caught my mini dachshund standing on the open door of the dishwasher licking all the plates he could reach.", "Exactly. My dog is the pre-rinse. I'm technically saving water that way too instead of rinsing them into the sink", "Yes, it IS!"]}
