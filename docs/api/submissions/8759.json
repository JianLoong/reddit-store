My gut feeling (based on different truck owners I know) was this, but I was unsure if there were special cases.\n\nMy quick and dirty Google search also pulled up $90k tops for a truck; $150k was the average for a semi-truck.", "You have the same thing in England and in Canada in older houses. Bath and toilet with sink in separate rooms but next to each other to share the plumbing. Makes it easier for people to use different functions at once, but I think it was designed because pooping and bathing in the same room seemed icky.", "Old Dutch bathrooms are kind of like that too\u2026 the whole floor is granite and is graded toward a drain by the shower. Our bathtub was portable.", "My Dad has a similar timeline for indoor plumbing in rural Kentucky.", "When I was a little kid my aunt still had an outhouse- while they did have indoor plumbing as far as a tub and kitchen sink, I don\u2019t think they actually had a bathroom built in the house until around 2000. Western MD", "OP could be building his 9th bathroom, still NTA", "NTA at all. No matter the situation OP should put their own immediate family ahead of their extended family.  In this case this isn't even an emergency or something where unexpected expenses from a medical issue or car breaking down or roof leaking can't be anticipated.  This situation is 100% of OP's brother's own making.  OP is not being asked to help family out of a tough situation, he's being asked to subsidize his brother's over the top lifestyle because brother is too irresponsible to be an adult and cares more about image than actual security for his family.  Maybe if he had saved instead of throwing his money away he wouldn't be in this situation but giving him money only ensures that the problem will continue and brother will become no more responsible.  \"No\" here is not only the best answer for OP but in the long term it's the best answer for OPs brother and his family as well.  If OPs mother cares so much about showing off brother's stupid choices she should be the one subsidizing the idiocy.", "Exactly. It's HIS money.

We are about to move into a 2bed/2bath just for us and the cats.", "Don't get involved with your brother's finances in any way.  If you gave him a loan with the truck as collateral, or bought it, he'd hound you forever and so would  your mom, guilting you with \"we're family...\"   Stay away from financial entanglements with irresponsible and self serving family members.  Your brother is his problem, not yours.", "This - you give him money now and I guarantee he'll be back asking for money again at some point in the future.\n\nSounds like he has a *spending* problem, not a money problem... Loans won't fix that - the fix is a lifestyle change.", "Mother is a massive enabler. Not hard to figure out the favorite child here. \n\nNTA, op. Get that second bathroom. Your brother selling an expensive truck isn\u2019t a hardship.", "I promise if you go the extra mile and scale down your bathroom plans in any way to give him money - it will be as wasted as setting it on fire.\n\nI can see someone like that actually gambling it away - bc they were sure they could double it - & he will give no f#cks, he will ask for more and you will not get a penny back.\n\nYour family needs the bathroom.  That's it.\n\nBathroom YES\n\nBrother - has other options\n\nYour Mom - just nod as if you agree w her and KNOW she's entirely wrong.", "I'm sure the truck's financed and he's behind on payments. That's what mommy meant when she said he's \"about to lose\" it.", "Yep, I had friends, a married couple/no kids , who spent their money as fast as it came in. The were always \"saving for house\" and bemoaning the fact that they couldn't save up a down payment.
