You're an adult and allowed to wear your hair in whatever color you want. If you are in the bridal party then I can somewhat see her point but she would have needed to discuss her preferences with you well ahead of time. You've stated you dye your hair off and on so it's not like this is something new.  If it were me I'd work on finding a cute updo that you can put some contrasting country flowers in or similar that makes it look pretty together and more \"country chic\". Take some photos and show that it doesn't necessarily look \"bad\".", "NTA.  I'm petty, so I would buy a $10 rainbow afro clown wig.  And keep my neon orange hair, too.", "NTA, OP gave 3 option.\nOP goes with current orange hair\nSomeone gets OP a wig that bride approves off but not on OPs dime\nOP doesn't attend.\n\nIts up to the bride to pick which of the 3 she wants.   2 have OP going so is it more important hair fits the barn or OP attends?", "NTA.\n\nuse a bright orange crayon \ud83d\udd8d  and check  decline", "Unpopular opinion, I\u2019d say NTA. However, I\u2019d kind of be ticked if someone came to my wedding with bright orange hair, but I\u2019m torn on that because come as you are.!", "ESH. Both of you think hair is more important than your relationship. So be it.", "NTA\n\nIf you invite someone to your wedding, or other party, you invite their whole person. Hair isn't entirely permanent, but it's a long-term thing that you can't just cut or color for the day. People who insist on you disguising who you are to attend their party are AHs.", "NTA. What is with people being willing to destroy their relationships with friends and family over fitting into a subjective \u201caesthetic\u201d for one day?", "I don't think your stepsister has the right to require you to change your hair colour.  But I do have a little bit of sympathy for her not wanting neon orange hair drawing all eyes... so could you wear a hat or scarf that co-ordinates with your wedding outfit?\n\nNTA", "Info - are you a bridesmaid? Did she ask you not to before you dyed it?", "NTA\n\nAnyone expecting to control someone else\u2019s appearance is just wild to me. If she\u2019d rather not have you there at all than have your neon orange mane in the crowd, seems you\u2019re not that close and missing the day won\u2019t be a big deal.", "NTA I have bright pink hair though I also change it rather frequently. She can't ask guests body's to fit her theme what if you lost your hair? Would she still expect you to wear a wig?", "NTA. I don't understand people's obsession with these themes and then treating their family and friends like dress up dolls and forcing them to alter their appearance. I agree with you and I also would choose not to attend", "NTA who the fuck had the energy to care about someone\u2019s freaking hair?", "Nta, dying/bleaching your hair is hard work and damages your hair. You shouldn\u2019t have to change it for a one day event.", "NTA. It\u2019s your hair, your choice.", "NTA. She doesnt get to demand you change your appearance to match her theme.", "NTA - This reminds me of a post in here of a bridezilla who photoshopped out her step-daughter\u2019s tattoos for the wedding photos without telling anyone until they went out (including the husband/step-daughter).\n\nHer justification? Her \u201cAESTHETIC\u201d (she capitalized it when she tried defending herself in the comments lol)\n\nMy advice: skip the wedding. She\u2019s clearly setting you up so she can twist the narrative into you \u201ccausing a scene\u201d when *she* inevitably throws a tantrum over something to do with you. She\u2019s the bride, so most people will implicitly take her side. You can\u2019t win, so best way to not lose is to not play.", "YTA I\u2019d typically bash a bride for this type of controlling behavior, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that your stepsister\u2019s wedding didn\u2019t occur to you as you dyed your hair neon orange. Too, you did it far enough ahead of time that you could pretend that it didn\u2019t even cross your mind that your hair would be what everyone looked at in every picture from your sister\u2019s wedding. In fact, her telling you to do something else with your hair makes HER the unreasonable bad guy. Well played.\n\nYou can buy a decent one-wear wig on Amazon for $25 -$35. Wear one of those or just don\u2019t go. You obviously don\u2019t like her much anyway.", "NTA but if she doesn't like it then you don't need to go to the wedding.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI've been dying my hair unnatural colors for over 15 years. At this point it's weirder for people to see me with my natural brunette. My best friend got married and asked me to dye my hair purple to match my bridesmaid dress. *That's* how you deal with fashion colored dye jobs. Lean into it, don't try to swerve by demanding wigs or dyed hair.", "NTA. I totally understand someone having even the most strict dress code for their wedding, but I feel like your hair color is part of who you are.", "I mean NTA, it's your hair. but come on, do you care about your step sister? Ofc no one wants NEON ORANGE in their wedding photos. Would it really be the end of the world for you to get a cute wig?", "Info:  Can you use a temporary dye on your hair to tone down the orange and wash it out after the wedding?", "NTA\n\nI swear when I get married there will be no dress code. Wear pj\u2019s if you want.", "YTA", "Are you in the bridal party? Even so this is bridezilla behavior but I can somewhat understand. If you\u2019re just a guest than she has no say over how you look. My advice- by the most ridiculous styles wig you can find but in a normal hair color (think like Marie Antoinette wig). Technically it\u2019s following her rules", "NTA. Expecting to have control over your whole family's hair color on your wedding day is ridiculous and obnoxious. \n\nI would be tempted to maliciously comply by showing up looking like this just to match the 'farmhouse theme':\n\n https://images.app.goo.gl/g9tQ4DBnhsnL2M169", "What about the tractor at the farm? It could be orange. Why are people supposed to be props for wedding themes anyways?", "NTA. The people calling you an ah can pay for a wig.", "NTA because it\u2019s your hair and I understand not wanting to damage it for one day. HOWEVER, I\u2019m wondering if maybe a compromise could be an up-do? That way it\u2019s maybe a little more subdued?", "I don't get that or this \"biggest day of my life\".\nI had a wonderful wedding and most things were exactly how we planned it. But in 20 years of marriage, it's just a small thing compared to having children and experience life.\n\nIf I had to choose one day as the biggest, the wedding day wouldn't even make top 5 and the absolute best would be the day my daughters doctor told us that she would make a full recovery from the injuries she got in an accident. \n\nThe wedding day is joy and love and hope, but the biggest days are yet to come. (If not, I kind of feel sorry for her)", "My blue/purple hair has faded into a nice periwinkle in most spots (issues that were covered when the dye was fresh). So, yeah, unless OP purposely chooses to reapply the dye close to the wedding, chances are it'll fade out to a more natural looking orange in two months.", "If not, OP can make sure it is bright and shiny orange by recolloring it. And she shouild, to make sure she looks her best for the wedding.", "Wedding photos are very easy to Photoshop if another person's body is so disturbing to you. \n\nAnd it is shallow. And it's her hair, who else is her hair supposed to be about?", "Yeah, I agree. Technically NTA because it\u2019s her hair and it sounds like she is just a guest, but she\u2019s also being petty. It\u2019s a little overbearing for the bride to be dictating hair color of guests. However, as a family member, she will likely be in some of the photos and yeah, those photos are forever. Her hair will likely fade a ton in two months so the neon orange it is now will be super muted. I would imagine she is going to get it touched up at some point in the next two months, so doing the neon orange again would be a deliberate move. Hair color is such a temporary thing though and this is still a family member. \n\nAt the end of the day, OP, you need to ask yourself if this is the hill to die on, and how you would feel if the situation were reversed. I have purple hair and it took 7 hours to get my hair bleached to be able to hold the purple and keep it vibrant, so I get it. It\u2019s time and it\u2019s expensive. Again though, there are compromises to be made. It just depends how important your step sister is to you and if this is really worth missing her wedding because of something as trivial and temporary as hair color.", "I would hate to have a bridezilla as a sister.\nNo one cares about wedding photos. They go in a draw and no one sees them again. Hell even if they are hanging up on a wall most people don\u2019t notice. I would rather have my sibling be there in all her orange hair glory. I wouldn\u2019t ask my sibling to change for a second. The experience is worth more than a 1000 perfect photos.\n\nNTA", "Wedding photos are impressions of the events of one day. If one of the guests has orange hair, who cares? If someone is looking at those photos every day for the rest of their life, stressing over the fact somebody dared to have orange hair, they've got some serious issues.", "Right! Someday she will look at her wedding album and regret not having her family there all because she objected to her sister's hair color. Of all the meaningless reasons to exclude someone you love from your wedding!\n What a soul-sucking way to live. So focused on esthetics that you destroy your relationship with your sibling.", "This \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc love this \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Except this isn\u2019t what happened.

I was kinda surprised when the purple faded to a teal-ish color lol", "Yep. I go through all sorts of shades and neon just doesn\u2019t last. By that wedding it could easily be very close to natural ginger or a truly hideous blonde with bits of orange", "Yea OP planned on keeping the orange hair and touching it up after getting it to a colour she loves ..as you said shes not in the wedding party and is a guest, so what's the problem, even if she was part of the bridal party, it still shouldn't matter ..what is the sister going to do, do a guest inspection on the way into the venue  ...madness \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Literally. \u201cAw damn, my SS is getting married, now I can\u2019t dye my hair\u201d lmao fuck that. It\u2019s hair. Get over yourself", "Your hair\u2019s hardly a life decision & this is a pretty easy way to get under your sister\u2019s skin if you\u2019re so inclined.", "Nope. I do, however, know how sisters can be, particularly when they don\u2019t much like one another as is clearly the case here.", "My favorite color my hair has been was an entirely unintentional gorgeous teal-y color from faded purple.", "How you look for months is absolutely a life decision. No one is thinking about your wedding even 5% as much as you.", "Oddly enough, only my face framing hair went teal. The rest of the purple stayed as is. Lol I didn't mind though, I thought it looked good.", "Not my wedding. Her sister\u2019s wedding.", "Now I wanna dye my hair purple with teal frames. Thank you.", "Doooo iiittttt!!! \n\nI have 3 colors, purple, bright blue, and a midnight blue (it shimmers, almost!). So the teal just fit right in."]}
