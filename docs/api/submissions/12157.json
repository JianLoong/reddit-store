It\u2019s a little overbearing for the bride to be dictating hair color of guests. However, as a family member, she will likely be in some of the photos and yeah, those photos are forever. Her hair will likely fade a ton in two months so the neon orange it is now will be super muted. I would imagine she is going to get it touched up at some point in the next two months, so doing the neon orange again would be a deliberate move. Hair color is such a temporary thing though and this is still a family member. \n\nAt the end of the day, OP, you need to ask yourself if this is the hill to die on, and how you would feel if the situation were reversed. I have purple hair and it took 7 hours to get my hair bleached to be able to hold the purple and keep it vibrant, so I get it. It\u2019s time and it\u2019s expensive.

You took a lot of time to bleach it to the point you could enjoy a vivid color. That's not a process that takes a couple weeks, that takes MONTHS. And a hefty bit of money.

I was angry. I was annoyed. And i told him such. However, if that had been her hair for a few months I wouldnt have blinked an eye. (FYI, i did not ban her from the wedding or any pictures or anything. I told him i was upset for them using my wedding as a trial run for her hair choices and that if she hated it she would be imortalized in our wedding photos. Then i never brought it up again, day of wedding or since) people are allowed to be upset but if they want you to change something they should be paying for it.

The super easy gone in one wash kind rely on a powder to coat the hair and honestly itch like crazy. The semi and demi permanent variety will leave stains behind. I learned the 2nd one the hard way after trying to put semipermanent brown over my raspberry red at the time. My red never looked right again til it was bleached and fully redone. And that bleaching and recoloring process is very costly. So for her to have gotten it to a vivid orange likely cost her quite a bit. And to have to redo it all would cost more, as well as further damage the hair by having to re bleach the whole thing so soon.", "Unfortunately a lot of people only get married nowadays to have their \u201cinstagram wedding\u201d and couldn\u2019t care less about the person they marry or their supposed family and loved ones. These are always the same people getting divorced within a year", "Right? My wedding wouldn\u2019t crack the top five either. Telling my husband I was pregnant for the first time. Giving birth to my children. Similar to you, the day I watched my extremely premature daughter die in front of me, and then the miracle moment when they got her back. The day she came home and met her older siblings. The day my husband had a really unexpected leap forward in his career, I\u2019ll never forget the excited happy look on his face when he told me. \n\nAll that to say, a wedding is just a wedding. Life is what makes your biggest days. People who have a wedding as their all in most important, I feel sorry for them. They are missing the point entirely.", "Exactly. I had a really big day a couple years ago. Several of them in fact, none good either. I'm still having big days, these are good things this time. None of those days involved a wedding either. \n\nEdit, completing my thoughts", "I have taken to telling first time expectant moms that they haven\u2019t yet experienced the best day of their life, no matter how amazing their wedding was.", "I agree, it is silly and the bride is being overbearing. At the end of the day, it\u2019s still a family member so she needs to figure out for herself if she is ready for the consequences of either keeping the color, or not going. The fact that she has people telling her she is being an AH means that there are people who agree with the sister, so there will be some repercussions. Will it blow over eventually, sure, but she\u2019s 19 and this is still a family member. So again, is this the hill to die on? Only OP can decide that for herself. \n\nAs an aside, when I got married, I hired someone to come and do the hair and makeup of my bridal party as well as a couple close family members (moms, aunts and a cousin). It was part of my thank you to them. It was not cheap. If the bride plans to cover the cost of doing hair for some people, she can put that money towards a decent wig for OP. They also have temporary hair dyes that OP could use without ruining her orange. Like i said, there are always compromises, it\u2019s just a matter of how important her step sister is to her. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I mean, that equally applies to the stepsister.

Not controlling every minutia and making it all about a bridezilla. Be true to yourself. You're perfect.\n\nMy wife and I have been together 18 years and known each other over 20, so our relationship predates legal same-gender marriage in the US. We got married once bc we loved each other and again to make it legal. Neither time was (or could be) traditional and all we cared about was our love and our loved ones. Ask anyone in the Rainbow crowd: diversity beats homogeny hands down every time.\n\nWe've had a lot of incredible days (and a lot of difficult ones) but our wedding days stand out among the best 3 or 5 not because we looked like a bunch of models on social media -- but because people we cared about showed up. My mom was going through treatment for brain cancer and didn't have hair on her right side bc of radiation. We lost her 13 months later, but I cherish the memory of my mom being there to support us -- I always have laughter through tears when I remember her joking at the wedding \"I wish I could get the hair to stop growing out of my chin and get it to come out of my head instead!\" My neice got the BEST photo of all of us CRYING with laughter when mom said that. So no, I didn't care about my mom's hair or lack thereof. I cared that she was there.\n\nSorry, bc this is too much of my story, but you get to express who you are however you want and you get to feel good about yourself.

My daughter had purple hair and was a bridesmaid in my nieces wedding.   My niece asked my daughter to change it back to her natural shade because her hair was going to be a distraction and clash with the bridal colors.  I said that\u2019s ridiculous.  It would cost a lot of money and potentially further damage her hair.  I told her to say no way.  But my daughter said she\u2019d do it cuz she wanted to be in the wedding and make her cousin happy.  She understood the request.  My kid is a creative artistic type and agreed her hair wasn\u2019t going to work in the pictures.  She changed her hair back to purple right after the wedding.  My daughter taught me a lot that day.  She made a sacrifice for her family.  And was very mature and calm about it.   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the OP for not changing her hair.  It\u2019s a big deal.  And definitely not what I\u2019d do either.

Our wedding doesn\u2019t even come close to our biggest day!   My own kid\u2019s wedding 5 years ago was bigger for me, than my own, and certainly a lot more fun!   There is something about being mother of the bride\u2026at a beach party wedding.  My kid had the best wedding imaginable.  And my kid knew it wasn\u2019t her biggest day, ever, sensible child.
