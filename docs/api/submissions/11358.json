I babysit for a lot of families but I have one main family who I\u2019ve been babysitting for a while now. \n(17F)\n\nThe kids used to be tame and very well behaved , but then, their parents divorced and the children\u2019s behavior has gotten worse and worse. The mom had to start working 2 jobs to support the children so she gets home really late now and the kids aren\u2019t used to that. I sometimes leave  a few 50 or 20 dollar bills randomly around the house to help her out.\n\nYesterday, I got to their house at the usual time. There\u2019s 3 children, 8M, 6F, and 1F.\n\nKids come up to me and greet me, the usual. I usually bottle feed the one year old first thing when I get there since their mother doesn\u2019t have time to. As I\u2019m preparing her bottle, I suddenly hear a loud thud and see 6 year old has fallen off the couch. She burst into tears and I figured out that 8 year old had pushed her off. I tried to get him to apologize but he took it as a joke and ran off. I comforted 6 year old and then finished making the youngest\u2019s bottle.\n\nI sat on the couch and fed her for a while and gave the oldest some coloring materials so they wouldn\u2019t be bored. I then hear a loud crash and look and see they had somehow gotten on top of the counter and broke a glass. I was annoyed and cleaned it up, they took it as a joke again and ran to their rooms.\n\nIt was quiet for some time and it was time for the youngest\u2019s nap. I put her to bed and checked on the two oldest, they were surprisingly quietly playing in their room.\n\nI began to make some lunch, but about 5 minutes in, I heard 1 year old crying. I went upstairs and saw the two oldest by her door. They had been banging on the door and playing with the light switches to scare her. I was extremely mad and told them they were going in time out. Big mistake. They threw a huge fit and started running around the house when I tried to catch them. They then locked themselves in the bathroom and refused to open it.\n\nAt this point, 1 year old was crying hysterically and I was on the verge of it. I walked out of the house with 1 yr old in hands and sat on the porch for about 30 minutes crying just trying to collect myself. \n\nWhen I finally came back in, they were out of the bathroom and they said they were really scared to be alone in the house and thought I abandoned them. I reassured them and told them that I just needed a little break. The rest of the day went by pretty smoothly.\n\nWell, when I got home this evening, turns out one of them told the mom and now she has texted me and said she doesn\u2019t know if she can trust me anymore for what I did. I tried to explain to her that I was just trying to calm down but she said she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. I am pretty upset with this and wondering if what I did was wrong? My mom said I did the right thing and I think so to.

It would have been better to find a quiet place to be alone in the house, but the behaviour you're dealing with from them is way outside of what a 17-year-old part-time babysitter should have to manage.

I have worked as a pediatric nurse and sometimes we get the horrendous situation where a nanny/caregiver abuses a child because of stress/etc. you did what we would recommend. To step away and recollect yourself. Just like others said, it\u2019s nearly the same as if you were downstairs and kids were upstairs . Sure probably would\u2019ve been a good idea to tell them you were taking 1F outside to take a break so that they knew you didn\u2019t abandon them. If I were the mom I would be thankful that you stepped away to recollect and calm baby. It\u2019s too bad she isn\u2019t listening to your side.

Make it clear that, no matter how the children *felt*, they were never left alone and their fears and tantrums to no supersede the reality of their behaviour. \n\nFinally, as much as I hate them, it's ultimatum time. She needs you far more than you need her, you have power to make constructive change here. The children's behaviour is partially their age, and probably exacerbated by their mother's increasing absence. *She* needs to lay out the ground rules of behaviour when you are caring for them. *She* needs to decide what tactics you can use on her children when they misbehave. *She* needs to enforce behaviours and punishments for their behaviour, even when you aren't there. And, most importantly, she needs to find a way to stop them locking themselves in the bathroom. *That is extremely dangerous behaviour*. If she can't do these things then, for your own *safety and security*, you must not babysit her children anymore.", "NTA make sure she understands that you were on the porch with the little one.

By Giving them money you are essentially working for free. This is time that could be spent working elsewhere, preparing for college or studying for school.\n\nYou seem like a lovely person.

Of course they were scared. \n\nClearly, you should never babysit those kids again, but they were still your responsibility at the time.", "Soft yta because you should have called the parents. You know these kids have impulse issues and have already hurt each other. They can't be left alone for 30 minutes (unless you are in earshot). And you weren't. It's not your kid to sit on the porch with. I had something like this happen when I was sitting, I called my grandma and she came over. You can't leave kids unattended when you are on the job.", "Soft YTA.\n\nAgree with a lot of other commentators, calling another person for assistance would\u2019ve been the best thing to do besides leaving them in a house alone for 30 minutes. They most likely already have abandonment issues due to the divorce.\n\nIt sounds like the 2 oldest need to start seeing a therapist. It sounds like they have some pent up anger from this divorce and don\u2019t know how to take it out so they\u2019re acting up instead. Divorce can be a traumatic event at such a young age.\n\nWith that being said, I think you should stop babysitting this family for good. The kids are obviously too much for you to handle. It is sweet for you to leave her money around the house, though.", "Soft YTA. There\u2019s no shame in admitting that you can\u2019t handle babysitting these kids. There IS shame in leaving two of them unattended for half an hour when you know they\u2019re not mature enough to be safe and stable on their own.

You're lucky they didn't get hurt. That's called child neglect.", "Very gentle and reluctant YTA. \n\nI was with you until you said that you were out on the porch for half an hour. By all means take a couple of minutes to collect yourself, but I would say that the max for that is, like, 10. 30 seems like a stretch, especially because the kids didn\u2019t know where you were for that time. If something had happened, you wouldn\u2019t have known about or had any ability to respond to it.\n\nTo be clear, you seem like a great and responsible person in general. I\u2019m not trying to kick you when you\u2019re down. I\u2019m just saying, that feels like a bit much to me and I can see why mom was uncomfortable with it.", "I understand how you were feeling OP.  But being a child caregiver is learning how to emotionally regulate yourself even without breaks and even when under very high stress. It sounds like a superhuman thing to do, to just not break down in front of those kids, but it would have been better to break down in front of the kids than to leave them alone.  YTA.", "Sorry, but do not take a job that requires responsibility for others until you get coping skills.  Also, young kids experience abandonment as trauma. Just a fact.

I bottle-fed the youngest, and suddenly the 6-year-old fell off the couch in tears because the 8-year-old had pushed her. I tried to get him to apologize, but he didn't take it seriously and ran off. Later on, the two older children broke a glass while playing on the counter, which I had to clean up. They then scared the youngest by banging on her door and playing with the light switches. When I tried to put them in timeout, they threw a huge fit and locked themselves in the bathroom.\n\nAt that point, I needed to step away for a moment to calm down and collect myself. I took the youngest outside with me and sat on the porch for about 30 minutes to regroup. When I returned, the children were out of the bathroom, and I reassured them that I hadn't abandoned them; I just needed a break.\n\nI understand that one of the children told you about what happened, and I want to apologize if my actions caused any concern or worry. I take my responsibilities as a babysitter very seriously, and I always prioritize the safety and well-being of your children. I hope that you can understand that I needed a moment to take care of myself in order to continue providing the best care for your children. \n\nI want to reiterate that I enjoy babysitting your children, and I have no problem leaving money for you on occasion. However, their destructive behavior is starting to take a toll on my mental health. While I want to continue helping you by providing child care, I believe it's important that you prioritize working with your children to address their behavior.\n\nI am open to discussing ways to manage their behavior and finding solutions that work for everyone. However, if their behavior continues to impact my mental well-being, I may have to consider other work options that are less stressful and come with proper benefits.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this matter. I want to continue working with you and providing the best care possible for your children, but I also need to prioritize my own well-being.", "NTA. What you did was exceptable. You went outside for some air.  Some people may have resorted to other ways that could really hurt the k8ds. Right now, you hold the power. She needs you more than you need her. If she feels that way. Tell her. If she doesn't trust her. You can not continue to watch her kids. I hope she pays you well. DO NOT LEAVE MONEY AROUND THE HOUSE TO HELP OUT. If you stay. Come up with a joint way of time out so you are both consistent", "NTA...  as a mother, I sometimes had to walk away (& if this lady doesn't agree, she lying).  Children are difficult and it can be hard.  Maybe time to look for another job if she's not willing to listen and/ or correct her children behavior", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe will certainly not trust you again, as it should be.", "And OP babysits to save for college. But she leaves some 50s and 20s bills because she feels so bad. And the mother never said one word that her babysitter does this. She has income and childsupport. And it is not up to OP to parent the children. To think the have to parents bit none if them seems to care that they act out like this. \n\nNTA", "Hahahah try to get that to any court, they will laugh at you.", "She should parent her kids properly. No babysitter will accept or stay with her children because of their behavior.", "Look, I've had a kid I was watching freak out because they couldn't find me before. I was in the pantry trying to climb the shelves and get mac n cheese. Kids don't have great thinking skills.", "As overwhelmed as the mom may be if she doesn't \"trust\" you, she shouldn't trust the money you give her then and should give it back. \n\nGoing to the porch to calm yourself and the baby was the right thing to do. If you didn't, you would've probably lashed out at the kids, and I'm sure no one wants that.", "Again they are children, they are impulsive and don\u2019t rationalize like adults. If she can\u2019t handle the job, she shouldn\u2019t be doing it.", "\"my experience was x, so that must be how all are!!!\"", "I agree.\n But no one will deal with this awful behavior more than once, and that's on their mother. \nShe is the responsible one to parent and educate them.", "Im gonna go with an ESH\n\nOf course the two older kids are acting out. A divorce is hard for kids at any age. They don't have the capacity to fully articulate their feelings and emotions and it doesn't seem like mom is doing much to try and help them. I get that you were stressed and were on the verge of tears but you said yourself they were climbing counters and breaking glass. In that time you were outside they could have done something far worse than breaking a glass. So I understand mom's point of view. But mom should have these kids in therapy or counseling so they can express their emotions and feelings about the divorce in a safe way.", "NTA. Sitting on the front porch is not \"leaving the house\" in my definition. You were literally sitting on part of the house!", "You need to find a different babysitting job. What you described sounds hellish. NTA.", "Slight YTA because the kids thought you abandoned them in the house, next time just tell them \"I'm stepping outside for a few minutes while you calm down and I calm down\" and 30 minutes is a bit too long, at age 6 especially but even 8 that's a loooong time.  I don't think I'd want you back to watch my kids because it seems like they are a bit much for you, on the other hand my kids don't behave like that because we have boundaries and consequences and I would also by very upset with my kids if they acted like that. If you do go back maybe ask what consequences you are empowered to give.", "Nta, this is a parent problem, and her response to you is indicative of why there is a problem. She knows they aren't listening and being brats. Most parents would have addressed the children's behavior, removing whatever privileges or other punishment to make sure this never happens again, and then next time you came over a reminder of, \"if I hear even the slightest inling that you misbehaved while I am gone....\"", "NTA. As parents. Sometimes you need a break this isn't any different than going to have a scroll session in the bathroom. At 17 you're dealing with 2 out of control kids and a 1 year old. They weren't totally abandoned. You were right out the front door.", "NTA. This family needs to find a new babysitter. It\u2019s sweet of you to try and help them financially, but that means you\u2019re working for free, and if you\u2019re so stressed you\u2019re crying at work, it\u2019s time to quit.", "NTA, especially with a **BABY** involved that mom is irresponsible to expect you to not get frustrated. You did EXACTLY what you were supposed to do when overwhelmed with children.", "NTA honestly I wouldn't sit for these anymore anyway", "Yeah I\u2019m surprised the kids even noticed, except that she didn\u2019t come stop them from whatever loud and destructive thing they were doing", "A pediatrician once told me long ago if you need a break, take it.  make sure the kid/baby is safe and step outside... a crying baby is an alive baby.. no matter how experienced a parent/baby sitter/ childcare worker you are, everyone has a breaking point and needs to be able to breath. I have 3 kids and if my kids ever acted like that, I'd lose my head I couldn't imagine trying to wrangle someone eles kids when I'm on the verge of tears myself after all they put her through", "Good to know! Thank you"]}
