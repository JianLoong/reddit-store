I babysit for a lot of families but I have one main family who I\u2019ve been babysitting for a while now. \n(17F)\n\nThe kids used to be tame and very well behaved , but then, their parents divorced and the children\u2019s behavior has gotten worse and worse. The mom had to start working 2 jobs to support the children so she gets home really late now and the kids aren\u2019t used to that. I sometimes leave  a few 50 or 20 dollar bills randomly around the house to help her out.\n\nYesterday, I got to their house at the usual time. There\u2019s 3 children, 8M, 6F, and 1F.\n\nKids come up to me and greet me, the usual. I usually bottle feed the one year old first thing when I get there since their mother doesn\u2019t have time to. As I\u2019m preparing her bottle, I suddenly hear a loud thud and see 6 year old has fallen off the couch. She burst into tears and I figured out that 8 year old had pushed her off. I tried to get him to apologize but he took it as a joke and ran off. I comforted 6 year old and then finished making the youngest\u2019s bottle.\n\nI sat on the couch and fed her for a while and gave the oldest some coloring materials so they wouldn\u2019t be bored. I then hear a loud crash and look and see they had somehow gotten on top of the counter and broke a glass. I was annoyed and cleaned it up, they took it as a joke again and ran to their rooms.\n\nIt was quiet for some time and it was time for the youngest\u2019s nap. I put her to bed and checked on the two oldest, they were surprisingly quietly playing in their room.\n\nI began to make some lunch, but about 5 minutes in, I heard 1 year old crying. I went upstairs and saw the two oldest by her door. They had been banging on the door and playing with the light switches to scare her. I was extremely mad and told them they were going in time out. Big mistake. They threw a huge fit and started running around the house when I tried to catch them. They then locked themselves in the bathroom and refused to open it.\n\nAt this point, 1 year old was crying hysterically and I was on the verge of it. I walked out of the house with 1 yr old in hands and sat on the porch for about 30 minutes crying just trying to collect myself. \n\nWhen I finally came back in, they were out of the bathroom and they said they were really scared to be alone in the house and thought I abandoned them. I reassured them and told them that I just needed a little break. The rest of the day went by pretty smoothly.\n\nWell, when I got home this evening, turns out one of them told the mom and now she has texted me and said she doesn\u2019t know if she can trust me anymore for what I did. I tried to explain to her that I was just trying to calm down but she said she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. I am pretty upset with this and wondering if what I did was wrong? My mom said I did the right thing and I think so to.

Tell their mom that you were on the porch so she\u2019s not learning it from kids who had gotten scared? \n\nIf I heard from my kid that they were scared and couldn\u2019t find the babysitter for a half hour, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to listen to any explanations either. Parenting comes with a certain amount of losing your mind. You may not be able to babysit for that family any more, and that may be okay.", "NAH. It would have been better to find a quiet place to be alone in the house, but the behaviour you're dealing with from them is way outside of what a 17-year-old part-time babysitter should have to manage. They're stressed and acting out, but their parents need to know about the extent of their behaviour -- they're bullying a *baby* -- and should be taking them to a child psychologist.", "NTA all you did is go on the front porch.

Maybe they could have,I don't know,opened a door and looked for her.. are you seriously telling me you have never gone outside to perhaps water the garden,pick up stuff outside, without taking them with you. I find that very very hard to believe.", "NTA  You didn't leave, you just stepped outside and took the 1 year old.  If the kids are fine in their rooms while you're in the kitchen preparing meals, they are fine with you outside on the porch.\n\nBut honestly, you're putting up with the fallout from the disintegration of this family and you're even leaving money for the mom -  take this opportunity of her \"losing trust\" in you to get yourself out of this situation.  She needs a better solution - why aren't the older kids in school and daycare?   Stop working for her.", "You didn't \"leave them alone\", you went out on the porch.\n\nSo she has them glued to her side whenever she's home? Come ooooon. NTA.", "You are wonderful and NTA. I have worked as a pediatric nurse and sometimes we get the horrendous situation where a nanny/caregiver abuses a child because of stress/etc. you did what we would recommend. To step away and recollect yourself. Just like others said, it\u2019s nearly the same as if you were downstairs and kids were upstairs . Sure probably would\u2019ve been a good idea to tell them you were taking 1F outside to take a break so that they knew you didn\u2019t abandon them. If I were the mom I would be thankful that you stepped away to recollect and calm baby. It\u2019s too bad she isn\u2019t listening to your side. Also please keep your money, you are providing a service. Hoping she listens to you.

Good luck with everything.", "You and your mom are beautiful souls.\n\nPersonally I think 6 and 8 should handle you being just outside on the porch. But clearly they haven't been raised that well for that. And you will receive the brunt (and blame).\n\nI truly do sympathize with the mother as well, but I think the situation is too much for a 17yr old (you OP).

You chose to solve the problem that you could, calming the baby. Make it clear that, no matter how the children *felt*, they were never left alone and their fears and tantrums to no supersede the reality of their behaviour. \n\nFinally, as much as I hate them, it's ultimatum time. She needs you far more than you need her, you have power to make constructive change here. The children's behaviour is partially their age, and probably exacerbated by their mother's increasing absence. *She* needs to lay out the ground rules of behaviour when you are caring for them. *She* needs to decide what tactics you can use on her children when they misbehave. *She* needs to enforce behaviours and punishments for their behaviour, even when you aren't there. And, most importantly, she needs to find a way to stop them locking themselves in the bathroom. *That is extremely dangerous behaviour*. If she can't do these things then, for your own *safety and security*, you must not babysit her children anymore.", "NTA make sure she understands that you were on the porch with the little one.

You\u2019re a good person and you clearly care a lot about them, but you should not be taking on so much responsibility (emotionally or literally). \n\nHand in your notice. Three children going through a big change and acting out would be difficult for most people to handle\u2026. You\u2019re only 17. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that to be condescending, you\u2019re clearly more than responsible and are handling things well. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think you should be taking on so much stress voluntarily at your age. \n\nEspecially as you are losing money from doing this. By Giving them money you are essentially working for free. This is time that could be spent working elsewhere, preparing for college or studying for school.\n\nYou seem like a lovely person.

You should have done your crying inside or called someone to come help you.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI understand the situation was overwhelming and frustrating. But the moment you got too overwhelmed you should have contacted the parent, told her the situation and demand she come home.\n\nYou left two young children unattended for half an hour. What if something bad had happened? Of course they were scared. \n\nClearly, you should never babysit those kids again, but they were still your responsibility at the time.", "Soft yta because you should have called the parents. You know these kids have impulse issues and have already hurt each other. They can't be left alone for 30 minutes (unless you are in earshot). And you weren't. It's not your kid to sit on the porch with. I had something like this happen when I was sitting, I called my grandma and she came over. You can't leave kids unattended when you are on the job.", "Soft YTA.\n\nAgree with a lot of other commentators, calling another person for assistance would\u2019ve been the best thing to do besides leaving them in a house alone for 30 minutes. They most likely already have abandonment issues due to the divorce.\n\nIt sounds like the 2 oldest need to start seeing a therapist. It sounds like they have some pent up anger from this divorce and don\u2019t know how to take it out so they\u2019re acting up instead. Divorce can be a traumatic event at such a young age.\n\nWith that being said, I think you should stop babysitting this family for good. The kids are obviously too much for you to handle. It is sweet for you to leave her money around the house, though.", "Soft YTA. There\u2019s no shame in admitting that you can\u2019t handle babysitting these kids. There IS shame in leaving two of them unattended for half an hour when you know they\u2019re not mature enough to be safe and stable on their own. For your wellbeing and theirs, it may be time to recommend their mom seek a new babysitter.", "Absolutely YTA. \n\nYou left two children unattended for half an hour? You're lucky they didn't get hurt. That's called child neglect.", "Very gentle and reluctant YTA. \n\nI was with you until you said that you were out on the porch for half an hour. By all means take a couple of minutes to collect yourself, but I would say that the max for that is, like, 10. 30 seems like a stretch, especially because the kids didn\u2019t know where you were for that time. If something had happened, you wouldn\u2019t have known about or had any ability to respond to it.\n\nTo be clear, you seem like a great and responsible person in general. I\u2019m not trying to kick you when you\u2019re down. I\u2019m just saying, that feels like a bit much to me and I can see why mom was uncomfortable with it.", "I understand how you were feeling OP.  But being a child caregiver is learning how to emotionally regulate yourself even without breaks and even when under very high stress. It sounds like a superhuman thing to do, to just not break down in front of those kids, but it would have been better to break down in front of the kids than to leave them alone.  YTA.", "Sorry, but do not take a job that requires responsibility for others until you get coping skills.  Also, young kids experience abandonment as trauma. Just a fact. It\u2019s not a positive experience, to put it kindly.  \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
