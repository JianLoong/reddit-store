So I think the UK rules are very idiosyncratic depending on the time, place, and individuals involved. Hell my dad is a vet and he seems pretty neutral on the idea as long as a cat is neutered, like we all had inside/outside cats growing up, my parents technically have an outside cat that promptly moved into the farm nearby and became a mouser for them where my parents only involvement now is my dad doing vet stuff in the cat for free, but also he sees nothing wrong with my cat being an inside cat so like. I think the UK is weird and doesn't have universal advice on the inside v outside cat debate", "I'm not saying that at all, just saying that here, I have never ever seen a bird killed by a cat."]}
