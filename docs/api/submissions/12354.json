That is controlling behavior on your part, demonstrating no respect for her perspective.", "LAsking is OK but you must accept her no which does not seem to do. For that YTA.\n\nIf you do not want any social media presence, tell her that she cannot post your face on social media. Problem solved.", "YTA\n\nYou absolutely can ask not to have your picture posted on her page. Anything else is controlling. Asking her to justify what she \"needs\" it for is unfair.

YTA.\n\nYou have valid reasons for making your social media private... for you. Your job as a bf/husband/etc is not to tell her what to do or not do. It doesn't matter how \"gentle\" you ask.

Question her reasoning for denying request.\n\nTo me this indeed sounds controlling and abusive.", "YTA- you sound like a conspiracy theorist. It sounds pretty controlling and a lot of women would see that as a very big, very bright, Red Flag.", "YTA. I think everyone here has articulated why very well: it wasn't bad to ask, but it's an AH move to try and push her otherwise now. You can ask that she doesn't post pictures of you, but that's the extent. She enjoys leaving it open, and asking us why means either 1.) you didn't bother asking *her* or 2.) you've tried prying apart her reasoning before to get your way, so she knew telling you was an invitation to that. Which would be very controlling and persistent behavior, if true.\n\nSome context: my best friend and I have very different perspectives on social media. She believes and acts exactly as you do, while I'm in the ballpark of your gf with carefree use. We have an understanding where we both acknowledge that both of our positions have merits and disadvantages, and we accept each other as we are. It hasn't done anything to our relationship - I don't see it having a big impact on yours either, unless you are stuck on it.", "I mean, yeah, you\u2018re the A. But I guess A is a pretty harsh word here. I mean, calling you controlling isn\u2018t very nice either if you just asked her, but I kind of see where it\u2018s coming from even though the wording is pretty strong.\n\nWhile I understand your reasons, it\u2018s still her decision. If you\u2018re just asking her, I think it\u2018s fine in general, but I can also understand her side and feel like she\u2018s not totally wrong. Like other users said, since it\u2018s her decision and she wants to keep the profile open, you can still just ask her for you not to be in the pictures that she posts and both of you would be fine.", "YTA. This is controlling and she\u2019s not wrong. You can ask she not post pictures of your face or any of your info however. But no, you don\u2019t get to tell her to do that. You asked, she said no. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of the conversation.", "YTA. As others have stated, this sounds really controlling. You mentioned reducing non-professional internet presence. You do realize that there\u2019s more to life than work, right?", "YTA\n\nshe is right, this will lead down a road that will allow you to feel even more comfortable making her change things that you \\*have no right to ask to be changed\\*. It'd be different if you asked her not to post you, but to believe she should change something she enjoys/uses just because \\*you\\* don't see value to it, is ignorant.

But you cannot demand her to close off her profile and should indeed try to keep an open and honest conversation.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t like me posting publicly either and has for instance asked me to only post vacation photos rafter returning home for privacy and safety reasons (burglars etc). I also almost never post pics of my kids out of respect and I ask them permission now that they\u2019re older both on my own as on our company page. But I know it costs us followers because people love to see their cute faces. My insta is public, my husband\u2019s is private.

But definitely tell her you do not want her posting your picture, that is totally fair.", "Why do people go to bars, clubs and concerts if they aren't going to talk to every person in the room? Why to people go to the cinema when you can just watch the movie at home?\n\nBeing a part of a larger social group with a shared set of experiences is a desirable experience for a lot of people.", "I love seeing my friend's kids, vacations, etc.  It helps me keep up with people I don't see often IRL.  That said, I respect people that don't have, like or want to participate in social media.", "This is not a debate sub. Look elsewhere for answers on that", "I always keep my Instagram public when I\u2019m job hunting. If a potential employer looks into my internet presence they\u2019ll find a representation of me that\u2019s both work appropriate and true to who I am. There are reasons why having a public persona is important.", "Not everything in life is about profit, also YTA", "[deleted]", "I'm actually with you on this one (fortunately, so is my wife). All of our social media is private, our kids didn't get on social media until 15 and we rarely posted pictures of them on our private account. I don't really get the fascination with posting pictures of dinner on Insta, I only use FB to keep in touch with friends, kind of feel like LinkedIn is turning into FB (may have to rethink my relationship with that platform...) and twitter is an enigma to me. She's entitled to her outlook, you are entitled to ask (not brilliant that you want to persuade her, that's leaning towards AH behaviour) but broadly think NTA as long as you respect her decision. At the end of the day, if she's happy and it's not bothering anyone it's up to her...", "Understand that she can say \u201cno\u201d to any request you make.  She might want to post a group pic and if you\u2019re in it then blurring or otherwise obscuring your face is the only way to keep your identity private.  You might find that weird but this whole thing is a *you* problem rather than a *she* problem, and she\u2019s under no obligation to accede to your requests, so you\u2019d best find a way to compromise in order to possibly achieve zero public presence", "Then you better get some chemo bc you're on a social media website right now,. Bud.", "Says the person on Reddit", "That\u2019s one way to look at it I guess.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to have boundaries and stick to them. No point in getting in a relationship then feeling uncomfortable about your partner being on the worlds biggest dating platform. Be honest from the start I say.", "It\u2019s only March, the year is young.\n\nNothing wrong with having boundaries", "Private means only your insta friends can see your pics, just but every creep you run into.", "I'm not on Facebook any more, but I remember initially how fun it was when it was getting big and getting the chance to catch up with childhood friends I'd fallen out of touch with.", "Good point", "That's a bullshit argument. You can still a a follow request to a private account. The only reason to have a public account is for people you don't know to see your account.", "Why would it have to be low self esteem?", "If he does not want to appear in other people's social media this is his right. I understand this because my name is linked to academic work being published and I do feel those pictures to be unprofessional. Hence I do not give consent to people posting my pictures if they show my face.\n\nAnd I put stickers and filters over any pictures I post myself.\n\nNobody is entitled to post another person without consent.\n\nOP YTA for demanding she adhere to your privacy but you are perfectly within your rights she not post you on her accounts.", "Instagram isn't any more of a dating platform than walking into a town square is.", "True but your boundaries can still be dumb", "Right and like I said, some people are much less worried about privacy than others. The default on most social media is a public account and many just never change that. Creeps can be blocked.", ">there is no good reason at all for a non-celebrity/influencer/business to have public profiles.\n\nLots of non-celebrity/influencer/business just like to share.

Just my two cents worth", "Did you know that people also exchange nudes and find relationships on reddit? Hope no one dates our sorry asses, with us using one of the world\u2019s biggest dating platforms and all.", "Would never happen to me, I\u2019m hideously ugly with no personality."]}
