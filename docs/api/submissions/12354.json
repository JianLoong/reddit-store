That is controlling behavior on your part, demonstrating no respect for her perspective.", "LAsking is OK but you must accept her no which does not seem to do. For that YTA.\n\nIf you do not want any social media presence, tell her that she cannot post your face on social media. Problem solved.", "YTA\n\nYou absolutely can ask not to have your picture posted on her page. Anything else is controlling. Asking her to justify what she \"needs\" it for is unfair.

YTA.\n\nYou have valid reasons for making your social media private... for you. Your job as a bf/husband/etc is not to tell her what to do or not do. It doesn't matter how \"gentle\" you ask.

Question her reasoning for denying request.\n\nTo me this indeed sounds controlling and abusive.", "YTA- you sound like a conspiracy theorist. It sounds pretty controlling and a lot of women would see that as a very big, very bright, Red Flag.", "YTA. I think everyone here has articulated why very well: it wasn't bad to ask, but it's an AH move to try and push her otherwise now. You can ask that she doesn't post pictures of you, but that's the extent. She enjoys leaving it open, and asking us why means either 1.) you didn't bother asking *her* or 2.) you've tried prying apart her reasoning before to get your way, so she knew telling you was an invitation to that. Which would be very controlling and persistent behavior, if true.\n\nSome context: my best friend and I have very different perspectives on social media. She believes and acts exactly as you do, while I'm in the ballpark of your gf with carefree use. We have an understanding where we both acknowledge that both of our positions have merits and disadvantages, and we accept each other as we are. It hasn't done anything to our relationship - I don't see it having a big impact on yours either, unless you are stuck on it.", "I mean, yeah, you\u2018re the A. But I guess A is a pretty harsh word here. I mean, calling you controlling isn\u2018t very nice either if you just asked her, but I kind of see where it\u2018s coming from even though the wording is pretty strong.\n\nWhile I understand your reasons, it\u2018s still her decision. If you\u2018re just asking her, I think it\u2018s fine in general, but I can also understand her side and feel like she\u2018s not totally wrong. Like other users said, since it\u2018s her decision and she wants to keep the profile open, you can still just ask her for you not to be in the pictures that she posts and both of you would be fine.", "YTA. This is controlling and she\u2019s not wrong. You can ask she not post pictures of your face or any of your info however. But no, you don\u2019t get to tell her to do that. You asked, she said no. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of the conversation.", "YTA. As others have stated, this sounds really controlling. You mentioned reducing non-professional internet presence. You do realize that there\u2019s more to life than work, right?", "YTA\n\nshe is right, this will lead down a road that will allow you to feel even more comfortable making her change things that you \\*have no right to ask to be changed\\*. It'd be different if you asked her not to post you, but to believe she should change something she enjoys/uses just because \\*you\\* don't see value to it, is ignorant. Her social media presence is \\*HER\\* choice, not yours, regardless of your opinions on it.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s a fair request but now you should drop it of you become TA.

But you cannot demand her to close off her profile and should indeed try to keep an open and honest conversation.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t like me posting publicly either and has for instance asked me to only post vacation photos rafter returning home for privacy and safety reasons (burglars etc). I also almost never post pics of my kids out of respect and I ask them permission now that they\u2019re older both on my own as on our company page. But I know it costs us followers because people love to see their cute faces. My insta is public, my husband\u2019s is private.
