At the beginning, we had done the whole museums, art galleries, quad biking, visiting a desert, going into the city etc. Even during the week I kept asking him what he wanted to do. Some of the things we did it was what he wanted to do. \n\nToday- I\u2019m getting ready to wind down for a day by the sea. He goes to me I want to go see old architectural sites in the city.\nI respond by saying but I thought we had plans to wind down. Instead he turns it on me. He goes rudely why do we always have to do what you want? This whole holiday is what you wanted to do. \n\nI was shocked and upset. As some of the things we did during the week was what he wanted to do. I also kept asking him throughout did he have any other stuff he wanted to do. He didn\u2019t say anything. When I suggested few days ago that on the penultimate day if we could not go to the city (we had gone into the city 4x already), and wind down at the resort. HE AGREED. \n\nInstead he goes I want to see the old sites etc. I said seeing it is not a problem itself but you never mentioned it all before whereas we could have organised it for the times we had gone into the city. But now when I\u2019ve made my plans you\u2019re putting this on me. I was also okay for him to go see the sites himself. But it wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nAs I\u2019m trying to explain myself to him, he just starts shouting. Naturally I got upset, so I refuse to go to eat breakfast with him. \n\nI just went and sat on the seats upstairs of the breakfast area. He had his breakfast and didn\u2019t even come up or anything. I then went and sat on the sand and just start thinking about things. 2/3 hours later I go to the hotel room. He has packed his stuff and tells me he is leaving to go back home. \n\nI don\u2019t say anything. He tells me I\u2019ve pushed things too far all and grabs his passport. \nI sit silently on the bed for another 30 minutes. He is angry. So I just leave the room and go sit by the sea.\n\nIt has now been 7 hours since this incident. He hasn\u2019t text/called. It\u2019s the evening now. For him to be okay to leave me alone in a foreign country isn\u2019t a nice feeling. I haven\u2019t been to the hotel room so I don\u2019t know if he has gone for definite or was just trying to get a reaction. I feel it was such an overreaction from him but he makes it feel like it was me who is crazy.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of this. Was I wrong? \n\nTl:dr- on vacation. Husband and I agree our plans for the week. We do some of the activities he wants to do. On the day I want to wind down, he changes it to wanting to go into the city again. When I query it, he kicks off saying this whole holiday I did what I wanted to do. Now has packed his bag and saying he is leaving to go back home.", "created_utc": 1683045858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135t9fe/aita_husband_m43_packed_bags_to_leave_vacation/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On vacations I spent the entire time anticipating what he wanted and it was quite difficult. \n\nAlso, having one laid back day on vacation is such a good idea. \n\nIf he did leave, do your best to enjoy your one night to yourself! Hang out by the sea, order room service. Do exactly the things you want to do.", "Uh wtf NTA what an overreaction on his part. He left you alone in a foreign country over a small argument? Does he normally react this extremely?", "NTA and the type of behavior I have come to expect from someone who dates an SO over a decade their junior lol", "The gaslighting here is real, if your account of events is accurate. This is a major red flag, and I wouldn't put it past him to do this again in the future.\n\nNTA - and heavily consider whether this is a common occurrence and if it's worth being in this kind of relationship.", "NTA. Holy mother of overreactions! 43 year old throwing a tantrum is what this sounds like. Idk if there\u2019s some INFO missing - kinda sounds like there\u2019s been some miscommunication or mismatched expectations maybe but either way, WAAAAAY overreacted. \n\nIf he does leave you by yourself and return, he\u2019s a GRADE A asshole IMO", "NTA - Even if there *had* been an imbalance in your activities vs. his or scheduling gaffes, his reaction is not justified. Yelling at you, refusing to hear you or attempt to compromise, and threatening to abandon you in a foreign country are all awful overreactions. If he hasn\u2019t abandoned you, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that even *threatening* such a thing is still heartless and cruel.\n\nHas he ever done things like this before? Or is it totally out of character?", "NTA but surely you realize this is not about vacation plans.", "NTA\u2014if he communicated that he was perfectly happy with the plan y\u2019all laid out and communicated that he was interested in many of the activities you guys did, there is zero reason for you to assume that he\u2019s unhappy with your vacation plans. \n\nWeird situation, very strong reaction for him to just pack up and leave a whole different country and you behind. I don\u2019t know his side, but based off of what you\u2019re saying, please don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy. \n\nDo I think there was a better way to communicate through the altercation overall instead of completely ignoring him during breakfast? Sure, but with his immediate jump to yelling and aggressive behavior, it\u2019s understandable why healthy communication is difficult to facilitate. I feel anyone would do something similar in your situation when being provoked.", ">As some of the things we did during the week was what he wanted to do.\n\nWhich things? You mentioned a bunch of actives - which were ones he picked or things you mutually were excited about? INFO", "NTA. And congratulations on using the word penultimate in the correct context as many don\u2019t.", "NTA. It sounds like there is an underlying issues. Not enough info to tell what. Either miscommunication, failure to communicate or manipulation.  I suggest counseling when home", "NTA. In terms of safety you are a 30 yo woman in a resort, you'll be fine. But does he throw tantrums more often? Because you need to be worried about how you are being treated.", "NTA. OP, don\u2019t put up with someone who treats you like this. Sometimes on vacation i get tired and overwhelmed and sometimes snap so I get it. But what he did is extremely childish, no one has to put up with being yelled at, he\u2019s not attempting a reconciliation but instead trying to punish you.", "NTA what a tantrum", "Couldn\u2019t he just go see those sites alone while you followed your original plan?", "NTA. Definitely emotionally stunted childish behavior. Seems on par for the older people that date significantly younger people (10+ years age difference).", "NTA. You better check to make sure he didn\u2019t take your passport too. Seems like that\u2019s the natural progression of this tantrum.", "NTA. But is there a reason you couldn't hang out at the beach while he went to the architectural site?", "NTA\n\nWas this the only time you guys disagreed during this vacation, or was this outburst out of the blue? Does he do things like this often? \nIf your accounts are accurate his actions are completely over the top. Why couldn\u2019t he go do what he wanted and you just relax for the last day? I\u2019m assuming also that you flew to your destination- he would really waste money to change his flight to go back early???", "NTA. This is more or less the behavior I would expect  from a man who married 13 years younger.", "NTA.\n\nHow *dare* you follow through on the plans you'd both agreed to beforehand. I mean, who even does that?!? \ud83d\ude44\n\nYour husband is a controlling, manipulative AH with a sizable chunk of cruelty (leaving a young woman alone in a foreign country!?!). If he's willing to ditch you in a foreign country, you need to consider ditching him when you get home. Do it smartly - secure your assets and have an exit plan that works for you.", "It sounds like you were very open about what you wanted to do and equated him not protesting as him agreeing and wanting to do them too. I would have thought the same, but he appears to be counting anything you suggested as being you getting your way even though he made no objection and apparently enjoyed it. Then he picks a fight and quite frankly you weren\u2019t handling that super maturely either and instead of toughing it out one more day, took his ball and went home. Even if you were a little bossy (no reason to think you were, just accounting for the possibility), he is acting like a child. NTA", "NTA but husband is. Do you have children or are you free to leave?", "NTA, but yikes there is a lot to unpack here. Firstly, let me be clear that your husband is a huge ah and a acting extremely childish and cruel by packing up and threatening to leave/actually leaving you. This is a *huge red flag*. Has he acted this way before? \n\nThis obviously goes deeper than vacation plans. Does he often just go along with what you say and not clearly communicate his own wants and needs? That would be a deeper issue in your relationship, though not your fault. It is up to him to clearly communicate with you. You\u2019re not a mind reader. If he struggles with communication and boundaries then he needs to go to therapy to learn how to do that better. \n\nYou very clearly communicated your wants/needs/boundaries from the start. He agreed. He is now getting angry that your sticking to your guns. Again, that\u2019s a him issue and should probably be unpacked in therapy. \n\nAs far as working together as a team (assuming you want to stay in this marriage and work to avoid future conflicts of a similar nature). Next time you\u2019re planning a trip, both of you should write down your top 3-5 activities for when you\u2019re there. Then try to plan the trip around that. If there isn\u2019t enough time for all of them then you need to compromise so that you each are getting in the most important thing at the VERY least. If relaxation is most important to one of you, then the compromise needs to be X amount of activities and X amount of rest days.", "As described, NTA. But...\n\nThere is clearly a lot more going on here. A person generally doesn't get so angry and leave during a trip unless there has been a lot of resentment building up. You say you both picked things to do on your vacation, but maybe he would see that differently. If you decide to stay together, I think couples counseling is in order.", "I do not believe this is the whole story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He got angry, packed his bags and left you alone in a foreign country because you didn't submit to him.   \n\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and you are not at fault here. You need to take a look at your relationship - how does he react when you don't submit to his will? Is this behavior an anomaly or an extension of what he's already been doing?
