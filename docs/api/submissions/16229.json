At the beginning, we had done the whole museums, art galleries, quad biking, visiting a desert, going into the city etc. Even during the week I kept asking him what he wanted to do. Some of the things we did it was what he wanted to do. \n\nToday- I\u2019m getting ready to wind down for a day by the sea. He goes to me I want to go see old architectural sites in the city.\nI respond by saying but I thought we had plans to wind down. Instead he turns it on me. He goes rudely why do we always have to do what you want? This whole holiday is what you wanted to do. \n\nI was shocked and upset. As some of the things we did during the week was what he wanted to do. I also kept asking him throughout did he have any other stuff he wanted to do. He didn\u2019t say anything. When I suggested few days ago that on the penultimate day if we could not go to the city (we had gone into the city 4x already), and wind down at the resort. HE AGREED. \n\nInstead he goes I want to see the old sites etc. I said seeing it is not a problem itself but you never mentioned it all before whereas we could have organised it for the times we had gone into the city. But now when I\u2019ve made my plans you\u2019re putting this on me. I was also okay for him to go see the sites himself. But it wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nAs I\u2019m trying to explain myself to him, he just starts shouting. Naturally I got upset, so I refuse to go to eat breakfast with him. \n\nI just went and sat on the seats upstairs of the breakfast area. He had his breakfast and didn\u2019t even come up or anything. I then went and sat on the sand and just start thinking about things. 2/3 hours later I go to the hotel room. He has packed his stuff and tells me he is leaving to go back home. \n\nI don\u2019t say anything. He tells me I\u2019ve pushed things too far all and grabs his passport. \nI sit silently on the bed for another 30 minutes. He is angry. So I just leave the room and go sit by the sea.\n\nIt has now been 7 hours since this incident. He hasn\u2019t text/called. It\u2019s the evening now. For him to be okay to leave me alone in a foreign country isn\u2019t a nice feeling. I haven\u2019t been to the hotel room so I don\u2019t know if he has gone for definite or was just trying to get a reaction. I feel it was such an overreaction from him but he makes it feel like it was me who is crazy.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of this. Was I wrong? \n\nTl:dr- on vacation. Husband and I agree our plans for the week. We do some of the activities he wants to do. On the day I want to wind down, he changes it to wanting to go into the city again. When I query it, he kicks off saying this whole holiday I did what I wanted to do. Now has packed his bag and saying he is leaving to go back home.", "created_utc": 1683045858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135t9fe/aita_husband_m43_packed_bags_to_leave_vacation/", "score": 316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a major red flag, and I wouldn't put it past him to do this again in the future.\n\nNTA - and heavily consider whether this is a common occurrence and if it's worth being in this kind of relationship.", "NTA. Holy mother of overreactions! 43 year old throwing a tantrum is what this sounds like. Idk if there\u2019s some INFO missing - kinda sounds like there\u2019s been some miscommunication or mismatched expectations maybe but either way, WAAAAAY overreacted. \n\nIf he does leave you by yourself and return, he\u2019s a GRADE A asshole IMO", "NTA - Even if there *had* been an imbalance in your activities vs. his or scheduling gaffes, his reaction is not justified. Yelling at you, refusing to hear you or attempt to compromise, and threatening to abandon you in a foreign country are all awful overreactions.

I don\u2019t know his side, but based off of what you\u2019re saying, please don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy. \n\nDo I think there was a better way to communicate through the altercation overall instead of completely ignoring him during breakfast? Sure, but with his immediate jump to yelling and aggressive behavior, it\u2019s understandable why healthy communication is difficult to facilitate. I feel anyone would do something similar in your situation when being provoked.", ">As some of the things we did during the week was what he wanted to do.\n\nWhich things? You mentioned a bunch of actives - which were ones he picked or things you mutually were excited about? INFO", "NTA.

Definitely emotionally stunted childish behavior. Seems on par for the older people that date significantly younger people (10+ years age difference).", "NTA. You better check to make sure he didn\u2019t take your passport too. Seems like that\u2019s the natural progression of this tantrum.", "NTA. But is there a reason you couldn't hang out at the beach while he went to the architectural site?", "NTA\n\nWas this the only time you guys disagreed during this vacation, or was this outburst out of the blue? Does he do things like this often? \nIf your accounts are accurate his actions are completely over the top. Why couldn\u2019t he go do what he wanted and you just relax for the last day? I\u2019m assuming also that you flew to your destination- he would really waste money to change his flight to go back early???", "NTA.

I mean, who even does that?!? \ud83d\ude44\n\nYour husband is a controlling, manipulative AH with a sizable chunk of cruelty (leaving a young woman alone in a foreign country!?!). If he's willing to ditch you in a foreign country, you need to consider ditching him when you get home. Do it smartly - secure your assets and have an exit plan that works for you.", "It sounds like you were very open about what you wanted to do and equated him not protesting as him agreeing and wanting to do them too. I would have thought the same, but he appears to be counting anything you suggested as being you getting your way even though he made no objection and apparently enjoyed it. Then he picks a fight and quite frankly you weren\u2019t handling that super maturely either and instead of toughing it out one more day, took his ball and went home. Even if you were a little bossy (no reason to think you were, just accounting for the possibility), he is acting like a child. NTA", "NTA but husband is. Do you have children or are you free to leave?", "NTA, but yikes there is a lot to unpack here. Firstly, let me be clear that your husband is a huge ah and a acting extremely childish and cruel by packing up and threatening to leave/actually leaving you. This is a *huge red flag*. Has he acted this way before? \n\nThis obviously goes deeper than vacation plans. Does he often just go along with what you say and not clearly communicate his own wants and needs? That would be a deeper issue in your relationship, though not your fault. It is up to him to clearly communicate with you. You\u2019re not a mind reader. If he struggles with communication and boundaries then he needs to go to therapy to learn how to do that better. \n\nYou very clearly communicated your wants/needs/boundaries from the start. He agreed. He is now getting angry that your sticking to your guns. Again, that\u2019s a him issue and should probably be unpacked in therapy. \n\nAs far as working together as a team (assuming you want to stay in this marriage and work to avoid future conflicts of a similar nature). Next time you\u2019re planning a trip, both of you should write down your top 3-5 activities for when you\u2019re there. Then try to plan the trip around that. If there isn\u2019t enough time for all of them then you need to compromise so that you each are getting in the most important thing at the VERY least. If relaxation is most important to one of you, then the compromise needs to be X amount of activities and X amount of rest days.", "As described, NTA. But...\n\nThere is clearly a lot more going on here. A person generally doesn't get so angry and leave during a trip unless there has been a lot of resentment building up. You say you both picked things to do on your vacation, but maybe he would see that differently. If you decide to stay together, I think couples counseling is in order.", "I do not believe this is the whole story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My ex (37 years older) left me in NY last year because I asked him what music he listened to when he was my age. Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t enough for me to end things.", "I checked her profile and didn't find other posts... What else has happened?", "he's laying hands on you, too? Girl I sincerely hope you're able to take steps to get out of there, he might not stop at pushing / pulling hair", "Oh love, this is not your person. Shouting at you (public or not), getting physical with you, and throwing tantrums when you won't change agreed upon plans to do what he now wants to do? The pushing and hair pulling are enough to say get out and get out now.", "INFO did you actually use the word penultimate when referring to the day before you leave?", "Even if you were wrong dropping your wife and going home is a VERY different proposition when it's a foreign country that she doesn't belong to. This isn't like leaving the bar early because she's drunk and telling her to take an uber home. I dont' even know how you leave early from a foreign country do you have \"buy a last minute ticket\" money?\n\nThere's being mad and then there's this. \n\nNTA.", "Sounds like he is not the best communicator and had a lot pent up. You\u2019re NTA he should have talked to you honestly throughout the trip when you asked what he wanted to do.", "NTA. He\u2019s abusive, privately and publicly, and he is escalating.", "Can you two not do different things? He can go visit sites and you can unwind on the beach. These kind of fights are so silly. You\u2019re a big girl, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to make your way to the airport tomorrow alone, if need be.", "Is this normal?\n\nThis feels like its about something else.", "Jesus, glad you got out of that one!", "Certainly OP is NTA but unless they have been together for like a decade that's not a super concerning age gap", "really? how else do people use it? what context other than \"order\" would they be referring to? Unless we're talking about new penmanship enthusiasts", "Incorrectly like my former boss who seemed to think it indicated the best of something. And I have seen others.", "really? that's.. fascinating. where are they learning the word without the proper context? I am not finding this very interesting. It's not that common a word. Oh well.", "If this \"counselor\" is at all faith-based or affiliated with a church, do NOT trust them. Those kinds of \"counselors\" are notorious for abetting and covering up domestic abuse. \n\nBecause [this is domestic abuse](https://www.un.org/en/coronavirus/what-is-domestic-abuse). You know this, right? The yelling, the gaslighting (lying about what he did and telling you you're making it up), the constant questions, the threats of leaving you stranded, the pushing and hair-pulling - these are all textbook abusive behaviors. And the ONLY reaction that you need to worry about having is getting yourself out of there safely.\n\nThere is absolutely no behavior or reaction you could be doing that would justify, excuse, or cause these behaviors from him. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing for you to take accountability for in this situation. You do not deserve this treatment, PERIOD. And these behaviors are the beginning of a cycle of abuse that will get worse over time, so the sooner you can leave him, the better.", "Stop blaming yourself. He's 100% in the wrong for how he treats you. He hurts you in purpose. You do NOT deserve that. It's not your fault. Don't let him make you think you deserve abuse.", "I have no frigging idea.", "NTA Op this is abuse, physical and emotional based on your comments. You really need to take a hard look. He is abandoning you in a foreign country. Is this really how little you value yourself? Because you deserve WAY better then this.", "ESH, you both sound like spoiled children that are making demands that the other didn't agree to!\n\nYou both need to grow up and find a way to communicate that doesn't devolve into childish ass arguments.", "NTA Why am I constantly reading about partners randomly yelling at the OP out of nowhere? It sounds like your husband has been issues buried deep within and is just taking it out on you.", "Hey OP, i want you to think about this really carefully: Would you behave like this to *your* friend? Would you go on holiday with your friend, acknowledge the last day was for rest then demand your friend stop resting and comply with what you wanted to do because you had changed your mind? From your post it seems like you're not that kind of person. Regardless of how long you have been in this relationship, his actions day that he thinks he is more important than you. You are 29, still young, and definitely gorgeous (yah i haven't seen ya but at 29 \ud83d\udc4ci like to think that's the age you start realising your own worth). You are worth being treated with respect, you are worth going on holiday with and not being berrated, talked down to, or abused. I read \"Why does he do that\" and wrote down all the things my ex did that made him and abuser, and although i was 31 when i finally left him, leaving him has felt like i can finally do what i want to do again, it has been liberating. Please liberate yourself.", "op=NTA as presented\n\nBut this behavior is so bizarre that **if** it has No precedence(something only you can answer) then it definitely needs exploring why he would react this way.", "NTA. Your husband is TA. If this were an isolated incident, I would say you guys need to work on communication because something is wrong here on his end. Reading your history, he seems to be manipulative and abusive. You need to get out.", "INFO:\n\nWhat was the split of activities? Was it 50% what you wanted and 50% what he wanted?\n\nOn previous vacations, how often do you guys plan activities that he wanted?\n\nNot trying to jump to conclusions, but unless he just flat out lied, it seems to be a habit of his activities being pushed back or ignored? And this just being his melting point", "NTA. Your comments on your deleted posts indicate you\u2019re in an abusive marriage. You need to get counseling to figure out how to keep yourself safe.", "NTA - Verbal and physical abuse? I hope you get away from him. What he is doing is not normal.", "Glad you guys are sticking it out. With age differences comes challenges but it can be a beautiful thing.", "Are you replying to a different comment? This person said their \\*ex\\* overreacted, and it wasn't enough of a red flag... but I'd infer that they realized later the relationship wasn't in their best interest.", "<<He has even pushed me before and pulled my hair.>> So he has at least started the cycle of abuse.  Does your counsellor know?    \nYou do know that abuse nearly always escalates(as in 99% of time)?", "You are being physically and emotionally abused.  Worse, you are blaming yourself for your mistreatment.  How exactly are you planning to deal with things better?  Learn to take a punch?  Fall without hurting yourself?  Cut off all your hair so he can\u2019t pull it?\n\nLeave this man.  Get a divorce.   YTA for staying with him.", "Deal with it by leaving! Holy shit, he is abusing you. Please understand this is not normal or healthy. I\u2019ve been married 25 years now and we\u2019ve argued. Sometimes it\u2019s gotten heated, but he has NEVER PUSHED ME OR PULLED MY HAIR.
