Of course you might have rights as a resident, but since you don\u2019t pay rent, it can be considered more of a squatter situation. You can be probably easily removed. \n\nAs you said his father is not usually that way and let you know when he is coming. Maybe he was stressed out, maybe it was last minute thing. No matter what, it\u2019s not conversation you should have with him but your boyfriend. Approaching it from a standpoint of: is everything ok, we were quite surprised by your visit, usually you let us know, instead of: we have rights and we feel uncomfortable, might come across better. He should get a hint. \n\nAnyhow, be careful not to disrespect a person who offers you free housing. And if you need to wear shorts and tshirt in the house, is it such a big deal?", "Not just rent but free utilities.  \n\n>To me its technically like when a landlord comes over without announcing it.. it\u2019s common courtsesy.\n\nYou've found a technicality to support your argument.   Except he's not a landlord and he owes you nothing... yet gives you an enormous amount.   The courtesy is all coming from him.  \n\n>He even stays at hotels despite having a home of his here, if we deem our lives to be too busy to have him over.\n\nYou're both too busy to allow him to stay in his house... putting him in a hotel for your convenience!   It's his house.   He doesn't have to announce his arrival at it.   Nor ask permission to stay.\n\n>He thinks I should always feel ready to go, since this isn\u2019t technically my home.\n\n>I should be able to be comfortable in my own home.\n\nThis is interesting... BF doesn't consider this your home yet you do... now that's a real problem you don't seem to see.\n\nYou consider it inappropriate FIL walked in unannounced.   FIL might consider it inappropriate you were wearing such little clothing... there's no position here that has the more morally correct point.  \n\nThis was the first time hes walked in on you.  You were embarrassed... that's *your* problem.   It's not OK that you want FIL to be alerted for your comfort and convenience.   You don't mention you've sought a solution that would involve changing your own behaviour.  Even having a robe handy would solve your issue without inconveniencing anyone... why not try that?  YTA.", "I think YTA here. You get to live for free but you want to impose conditions on the owner of your free house... I don't think that's OK.\n\nHowever he should always knock.", "YTA because you\u2019re living for completely free, you don\u2019t even pay utilities. If you go and confront your partners father be prepared to have to find and actually pay for a place to live especially since the incident only happened once and could have been a mistake or miscommunication between ur partner and his father.", ">I should be able to be comfortable in my own home. I am not going to criticise him, just tell him to announce it first.\n\n\n\n\nLoool\n\nDid he approve your move or you moved in because his son lives rent free at one of his dad's properties? \n\nI'm not saying your bf should not talk to his father but this was a one time thing. HE can say something or he can choose to wait and see if the father does it again. \n\nMaybe he didn't know or forgot you were living RENT FREE in his house? \n\nCareful stepping Op. \n\nThere is always an eviction and that man, he sounds like he has the money and time to make it happen.", "Still his house. You can move out. No problems then.", "Yeah, YTA. You admit that you\u2019re living in someone else\u2019s house, free of charge, because it is convenient for you. You\u2019ll have to accept that you don\u2019t have any control over the environment without a formal agreement of some kind with the owner. \n\nSHOULD your boyfriend\u2019s dad announce he\u2019s coming? Maybe, but he\u2019s not under any obligation to do so.", "YTA, it\u2019s not your own home, you don\u2019t even have a lease, so he\u2019s not your landlord", "INFO: did he knock or call out? Or he just walked in the door?\n\nIf this has only happened once, it seems like your bf could just be like \u201chey, can you call or knock\u201d and then that would be it. \n\nOr just put a robe by the door because you\u2019re living there for free. Not everything needs to be escalated to a blow out fight over \u201cboundaries\u201d.", "Esh. Yes ok I get that it would be nice for him to announce when he is coming over. However, if I could live in a house rent free and not having to pay utilities I wouldn\u2019t complain. \n\nWhat does make you an AH is not even allowing him to stay in HIS house because your lives are \u201ctoo busy\u201d. You do come across as a bit entitled and don\u2019t forget it is HIS house and not yours. You literally pay 0 to stay there be grateful", "It\u2019s FIL\u2019s house, but he doesn\u2019t primary live there. His \u201chome\u201d is elsewhere, as he lives abroad. \n\nIt\u2019s OP\u2019s home, as in they live there and nowhere else, but don\u2019t own it. \n\nThe way the question could be framed, \u201cWhy should FIL knock before entering his own home?\u201d doesn\u2019t take the subtleties into account. Yeah, OP should be able to relax, not have someone unexpectedly enter. Knocking would be polite.", "Could you approach it as something like this \"Hey bfs dad, this isn't a complaint but more that we would hate to cause you any embarrassment so we just wanted to let you know that we usually dress very minimally when we are relaxing at home. When you turned up unannounced last time I had to run into the bedroom and quickly get dressed more appropriately. We know it's your house and you are entitled to turn up whenever you want but we wanted to make sure that we didn't put you in that position again. Would you be ok with giving us at least some advance notice when you are coming over? Even just 30 minutes or so would be good, then we can make sure you don't walk in on us walking around in our underwear or bathrobes. if you don't want to do that, it's ok, we'll just make sure we are always \"visitor ready\" from now on\".  \n\n\nBTW, I do think he should have to give you notice, but if he isn't inclined to then you need to figure out how to deal with it without losing your sweet rent free deal. I also think your bf should be the one making the request of him. But it might just be worth letting it go this time and seeing if it happens again.   \nWould you consider just sitting there and letting him walk in  and catch you scantily clad? That might actually embarrass him enough that he didn't do it again? Alternatively could you keep a light robe in your lounge area so you could quickly grab it and cover yourself.  \n\n\nSome of this depends on how much modesty is important to you. I recall a time I asked my mother to stop letting herself into our house with her key, that she should respect our privacy and knock and wait to be let in. She thought that was ridiculous and said she wasn't going to do that. So I said \"fine, just be aware that we often have sex on that couch so you might walk in on that if you don't knock and wait\". She never let herself in unannounced again. Still makes me smile.", "**YTA** \n\nA landlord is bound by rules because the tenant pays rent but you are living rent free in your FIL\u2019s home so he actually owes you nothing. \n\nIf you insist on rules,  what leverage do you think you have?  To threaten to move out if he does not follow your \u201crules\u201d?  You may want to think this through. \n\nHe may have also been embarrassed by the incident and may on his own, give you notice next time\u2026 But unless you offer to pay rent to establish your rights as a tenant \u2014 just make sure you are always dressed as if you are a guest in someone else\u2019s house.", "NTA but get a tenancy agreement and offer to start paying rent or something put in place for your own security.", "NTA\n\n(But your title doesn\u2019t match your post)", "YTA. Its not your house. He is not an unannounced landlord or visitor. He owns it. That make is his house always. You just stay there.", "Yta & ridiculously entitled. You live in his house, for free.

Wow.", "NTA but if you bring it up super confrontational, you do risk losing your housing.

Fuck social norms!\u201d is the Reddit refrain I guess. If she paid a nominal amount, is she suddenly entitled to basic privacy because money got involved? I guess I just don\u2019t relate to my interpersonal relationships being that transactional.

His father is quite wealthy and owns several houses, some of them rented out to people and some completely empty. This one happened to be empty, which is why my boyfriend lives there. He\u2019s been living there for years now. I moved in a year ago.\n\nIt\u2019s completely owned by his father, and we just live there. No formal papers, just have our address there. The agreement is that we can live there freely, and treat it like our own. \nI moved in because it was cheaper for me as I do not pay utilities and rent, and found it more useful for me.\n\nHis father lives abroad, and sometimes comes to our country for business related things. He often stay in hotels near his workplaces but sometimes he comes over with us and stays for a couple of days, and I don\u2019t mind that at all. It\u2019s nice spending time with him. \n\nUsually he\u2019s super respectful of our boundaries and doesn\u2019t mind that we made it our home at all, it is just an empty house of his after all. He even stays at hotels despite having a home of his here, if we deem our lives to be too busy to have him over.\n\nLast time he came over it was\u2026 not so nice. He came without announcing it, and I was sitting on the couch barely wearing anything. I didn\u2019t even know he was in the country. I had to rush up and get dressed proper. I found it so inappropriate.  To me its technically like when a landlord comes over without announcing it..  it\u2019s common courtsesy. \n\nMy boyfriend found it inappropriate too, but he didn\u2019t want to bring it up to his father and found me difficult. He thinks I should always feel ready to go, since this isn\u2019t technically my home.\n\nI  am so deeply embarrassed by the situation and want to put down my boundaries. I should be able to be comfortable in my own home. I am not going to criticise him, just tell him to announce it first. \n\nLet me know if I\u2019m lacking any information!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He thinks I should always feel ready to go, since this isn\u2019t technically my home.\n\nThis says it all. This is NOT your home. Your boyfriend said so. \n\nYou should really talk to him about your future. If you keep dating and living there, this will never be your home? \n\nI would move out. I rather pay rent and be confortable in my actually home.\n\nAlso, this is, in fact, your fil house. Its in his name, he pay taxes on it. I dont know how the talk \"you can live on my place\" went with him and your boyfriend, but maybe, back then, he put some boundaries that you are not aware of it.\n\nHe has been very respectfull but maybe he is more stressfull and didnt remember of letting you know. Or maybe he is tired of not being hable to use is own home because now his son is living with a girl.\n\nCommunication is key. Talk to your boyfriend and define the relationship and your future.", "YTA. He\u2019s not your landlord - you are a squatter.", "NTA for wanting not to worry about someone just walking in you.
