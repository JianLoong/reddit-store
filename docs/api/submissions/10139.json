You handled this really well. Jake is TA here - there's absolutely no reason he should have said what he did. What did he hope to prove, or get out of the conversation? It seems like Jake doesn't want you to be together, and he's trying to sow the seeds of doubt.", "Absolutely NTA this \"friend\" sounds like someone your husband needs to leave behind. If one of my friends told my wife anything similar to that they'd either have to profusely apologize or take a hike", "Jake is extremely jealous of you and your husband.\n\nIf I had to guess your husband gets hit on by women and Jake can't handle it so he is lashing out.", ">my husband was the type to date a bunch of models before bagging himself a trophy wife at 45\n\nI mean in back handed way he really did call you ugly or at least not beautiful to some standards. Could poke holes in what you did here but to my mind Jakes is by far the biggest AH in this whole thing. NTA", "NTA.  Jake might not have directly said \u201cugly\u201d but that was definitely what he was implying without using the word.", "NTA\n\nJake knew he was the AH and he got caught being one. \n\nGlad your husband stood up for you.", "NTA. That's what Jake meant by his comment. There was no lie there.", "NTA. This dude needs cut out of your friend group, he's clearly not a kind and supportive friend.", "NTA. People are focusing on the fact that Jake did not actually say \"ugly\" but context is everything. You knew the context so I don't think you misrepresented what he said.\n\nAlso if I had to guess your husband probably blew up on him because he sees you for more than physical beauty. He sees the person and not the package if that makes sense? Jake probably mentioned his opinion in a very nonchalant manner. In a way your husband would normally ignore but couldn't after knowing how he spoke to you. YOU did nothing wrong and to be quite frank Jake sounds like a terrible friend.", "NTA and I mean, did he not call you ugly?  Like, what is \"my husband was the type to date a bunch of models before bagging himself a trophy wife at 45\" supposed to mean if not saying you aren't pretty enough for him?  Guy sounds like a major jerk.", ">He knew I was offended because he tried to turn the conversation\n\nHe knew the implication was that you are no model and tried to make things right. NTA but he is a huge one. Who would say such hurtful things to a \"friend's\" wife? Just because he didn't say the word 'ugly' doesn't mean that isn't what he was saying.\n\nEdit: Also, your husband is mad not just because of the insult to you but he was also insulted by Jake. What does that say about what he thinks about your husband that he would only marry for looks after sleeping with tons of women? What a dick thing to say.", "NTA\n\nHe may not have said ugly but I don\u2019t know how anyone else would take that, I would also be offended and take it as that I was not attractive enough for my husband.  And it\u2019s been a consistent \u201cyou are lucky to be with your husband\u201d over a period of time to YOU, so I think he\u2019s openly saying this about you and your husband to any other potential mutual friends\n\nHe\u2019s a dick, your husband is good, and if the friend didn\u2019t want shit to happen he should have kept his mouth shut", "NTA\n\nSo you can be smart or pretty but not both?

Jake wants you to be the one with the problem so he doesn\u2019t have to face his own issues.", "NTA-It's seems pretty clear to me who is the AH here and it's not you.", "NTA I would want to know if a so called friend of mine spoke to my husband like that, I would also raise it with them and be livid. No actual friend would voice that even if they thought it. Congrats on having a great partner that sticks up for you.", "NTA. Your husband has got your back, just leave it. He got angry because someone disrespected you. Don't fret over Jake's feelings in this.", "NTA - your husband's friend is a jerk.", "NTA and does Jake have a crush on OP or the husband because i cant tell", "Is Jake secretly in love with you or something? Since he keeps going on about it then waited to escalate it, there\u2019s gotta be a reason", "NTA...why would anyone hangout with a guy who thinks women care just \"arm candy\"", "Jake may not have said \u201cyou\u2019re ugly\u201d verbatim, but he still implied it, especially with this model comment. Your husband is a good man sticking by your side and if anything, your husband also did himself a favor by getting rid of that toxicity. \n\nNTA. The trash takes itself out.", "Mostly NTA, but you could have handled it better.\n\nJake is a borish jerkface.  Total A-Hole.\n\nYou showed some a-hole tendencies by somewhat misrepresenting the comments to your husband.  You really should express your frustration in clear terms to Jake and your husband.\n\n\"I don't want to hear any more jokes about how my husband could do better.\" \n\nCredit to your husband for standing up to him and not excuse the behavior.", "YTA - so is Jake, and you're both playing games w your husband. \n\nYou got hurt feelings because Jake ran his mouth which he had no buisness doing - BUT you then spun a tale, and acted like a 14 year old \"promise you won't say anything\" - you don't know what he's saying behind your back - and you're both talking behind your husband's back and stirring the pot, which amounts to manipulation. \n\nThe adult way to handle that would have been to call your husband into the conversation in the moment and talk everything out right then and there. This would have given your husband the opportunity to speak for himself. He might have told Jake to FO, and tell you why he married you, he might have told you both to grow up, he may have done a hundred different things. \n\nBut now that honesty is all out the window - you've both created a world of drama and put that man right in the middle. Why - sounds to me like you are insecure, that jake is an asshole, and your husband is sick of both of your shit, but now there is a huge rift that didnt need to be there \n\nit's time to leave Jr Highschool", "ESH what a ton of drama", "ESH\n\nYou did start shit here.

Regardless, the only AH here is your husband's, \u201c friend.\u201d", "NTA. I'm legitimately not on my husband's level but I can't imagine any of his friends ever saying it. To. My. Face. WTAF?? \n\nI'm glad you married a dude who recognizes that comments made by his friends to his wife hold weight and influence and this is *not* the direction he wants his friend influencing his wife.", "To be very clear, while it isn't TECHNICALLY what he said, it's absolutely what he was trying to say and his comments afterwards were backpedaling, so I don't think you mischaracterized what he said at all", "YTA, you intentionally twisted what he said to start a fight, sure makes it seem like neither of you has matured since high-school.", ">  my husband was the type to date a bunch of models before bagging himself a trophy wife at 45.\n\nIt seems like he was calling you ugly.  If that's the case then NTA.\n\nBecause of your title, I am wondering if he was merely saying that your husband would have ended up so shallow that he would have opted for a much younger girl to marry.  If that's the case then YTA as he is actually paying you a compliment in his special way.", "This Jake guy was trying to stir the shit by saying hurtful unhelpful things.   He's a jerk.  You are NTA.", "YTA. That isn't what said.  You intentionally tried to cause a fight because you got your feelings hurt then asked him not to say anything like a 10 year old. Did you get the reaction you were looking for?", "She shouldn't have put words in Jake's mouth, then she wouldn't have to explain how she was untruthful the first time.", "We're in our 20s not 40s", "Dude, his \"joke\" implied that she's ugly.", "I'm guessing Jake doubled down on his statement and insisted bc he didn't use the term \"ugly\" that OP has no reason to be upset. But in actuality,  he confirmed that he thinks OP would not be attracted to his wife if they met now which is a big insult to OP and their marriage. \n\nI'm guessing Jake is single. \ud83d\ude06", ">His friend, Jake, likes to joke about how **I was lucky I met my husband when I did.** I usually don\u2019t take it personally but he brought it up while my husband wasn\u2019t within earshot and he made a point to tell me how **he didn\u2019t think we would\u2019ve ended up married if we met as adults.** When I asked him why, he told me that **if I was being honest with myself I could see my husband was the type to date a bunch of models before bagging himself a trophy wife at 45.** He knew I was offended because he tried to turn the conversation around by saying I was too smart to just be a trophy wife and that **my husband wouldn\u2019t have been my type if I met him as an adult either because he \u201cwas a bit of a dick\u201d.**\n\nThat post. I read that post. The post where this man was telling her that it is because of timing and her influence that her husband is the man that he is, and without these circumstances he would have been some sort of 'player' who eventually married a 'trophy wife.' Jake was confidently stating that THIS is the type of man he would have become if not for her presence in his life, and if not for the timing of their relationship that he wouldn't have grown into a person she would have considered worthwhile for a relationship. I consider that a pretty insulting thing to say about a partner, especially in the context of waiting until that partner isn't around to hear this and give their response. Jake here essentially says that he believes OP's husband is the type of man who, if not for her presence, would have ended up in a superficial relationship in his 40's with a younger woman purely due to appearances and social status. That the only thing that kept him from taking this path in life was OP's presence and that's it. That is an insult to both of them. It shows he believes OP's husband lacks agency in his own personal growth and development.", "His joke implied she's not a trophy wife. That's not the same thing.", "Delusion", "It sounds to me like Jake is trying to tell OP that something fishy is going on...her husband, who has been with her his entire adult life, is the type to date models before settling down late in life? Except he settled down as a teenager. I wonder if Jake believes or has seen that her husband hasn't actually settled down and is trying to warn OP about it. Otherwise, this makes no sense."]}
