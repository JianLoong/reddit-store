You handled this really well. Jake is TA here - there's absolutely no reason he should have said what he did. What did he hope to prove, or get out of the conversation? It seems like Jake doesn't want you to be together, and he's trying to sow the seeds of doubt.", "Absolutely NTA this \"friend\" sounds like someone your husband needs to leave behind. If one of my friends told my wife anything similar to that they'd either have to profusely apologize or take a hike", "Jake is extremely jealous of you and your husband.\n\nIf I had to guess your husband gets hit on by women and Jake can't handle it so he is lashing out.", ">my husband was the type to date a bunch of models before bagging himself a trophy wife at 45\n\nI mean in back handed way he really did call you ugly or at least not beautiful to some standards. Could poke holes in what you did here but to my mind Jakes is by far the biggest AH in this whole thing. NTA", "NTA.  Jake might not have directly said \u201cugly\u201d but that was definitely what he was implying without using the word.", "NTA\n\nJake knew he was the AH and he got caught being one. \n\nGlad your husband stood up for you.", "NTA. That's what Jake meant by his comment. There was no lie there.", "NTA. This dude needs cut out of your friend group, he's clearly not a kind and supportive friend.", "NTA. People are focusing on the fact that Jake did not actually say \"ugly\" but context is everything. You knew the context so I don't think you misrepresented what he said.\n\nAlso if I had to guess your husband probably blew up on him because he sees you for more than physical beauty. He sees the person and not the package if that makes sense? Jake probably mentioned his opinion in a very nonchalant manner. In a way your husband would normally ignore but couldn't after knowing how he spoke to you. YOU did nothing wrong and to be quite frank Jake sounds like a terrible friend.", "NTA and I mean, did he not call you ugly?  Like, what is \"my husband was the type to date a bunch of models before bagging himself a trophy wife at 45\" supposed to mean if not saying you aren't pretty enough for him?  Guy sounds like a major jerk.", ">He knew I was offended because he tried to turn the conversation\n\nHe knew the implication was that you are no model and tried to make things right. NTA but he is a huge one. Who would say such hurtful things to a \"friend's\" wife? Just because he didn't say the word 'ugly' doesn't mean that isn't what he was saying.\n\nEdit: Also, your husband is mad not just because of the insult to you but he was also insulted by Jake. What does that say about what he thinks about your husband that he would only marry for looks after sleeping with tons of women? What a dick thing to say.", "NTA\n\nHe may not have said ugly but I don\u2019t know how anyone else would take that, I would also be offended and take it as that I was not attractive enough for my husband.  And it\u2019s been a consistent \u201cyou are lucky to be with your husband\u201d over a period of time to YOU, so I think he\u2019s openly saying this about you and your husband to any other potential mutual friends\n\nHe\u2019s a dick, your husband is good, and if the friend didn\u2019t want shit to happen he should have kept his mouth shut", "NTA\n\nSo you can be smart or pretty but not both? But you can be both vain and insecure? Jake is a conundrum.\n\nJake gave you his opinion on a situation that has absolutely nothing to do with him.

Your husband thinks you are beautiful and smart.\n\nEdit to correct 2 words", "NTA.\n\nIf Jake wants to shoot off his stupid mouth, he should do it to your husband, not you. That wasn't a funny \"joke.\"", "NTA\nI\u2019m going to imagine your husband wasn\u2019t upset at first because he figured Jake was joking.

(If I had to guess I\u2019d say it was something along the line of \u201cshe\u2019s not ugly but you could definitely do better\u201d). That\u2019s why they argued. Jake wants you to be the one with the problem so he doesn\u2019t have to face his own issues.", "NTA-It's seems pretty clear to me who is the AH here and it's not you.", "NTA I would want to know if a so called friend of mine spoke to my husband like that, I would also raise it with them and be livid. No actual friend would voice that even if they thought it. Congrats on having a great partner that sticks up for you.", "NTA. Your husband has got your back, just leave it. He got angry because someone disrespected you. Don't fret over Jake's feelings in this.", "NTA - your husband's friend is a jerk.", "NTA and does Jake have a crush on OP or the husband because i cant tell", "Is Jake secretly in love with you or something? Since he keeps going on about it then waited to escalate it, there\u2019s gotta be a reason", "NTA...why would anyone hangout with a guy who thinks women care just \"arm candy\"", "Jake may not have said \u201cyou\u2019re ugly\u201d verbatim, but he still implied it, especially with this model comment. Your husband is a good man sticking by your side and if anything, your husband also did himself a favor by getting rid of that toxicity. \n\nNTA. The trash takes itself out.", "Mostly NTA, but you could have handled it better.\n\nJake is a borish jerkface.  Total A-Hole.\n\nYou showed some a-hole tendencies by somewhat misrepresenting the comments to your husband.  You really should express your frustration in clear terms to Jake and your husband.\n\n\"I don't want to hear any more jokes about how my husband could do better.\" \n\nCredit to your husband for standing up to him and not excuse the behavior.", "YTA - so is Jake, and you're both playing games w your husband. \n\nYou got hurt feelings because Jake ran his mouth which he had no buisness doing - BUT you then spun a tale, and acted like a 14 year old \"promise you won't say anything\" - you don't know what he's saying behind your back - and you're both talking behind your husband's back and stirring the pot, which amounts to manipulation. \n\nThe adult way to handle that would have been to call your husband into the conversation in the moment and talk everything out right then and there. This would have given your husband the opportunity to speak for himself. He might have told Jake to FO, and tell you why he married you, he might have told you both to grow up, he may have done a hundred different things. \n\nBut now that honesty is all out the window - you've both created a world of drama and put that man right in the middle. Why - sounds to me like you are insecure, that jake is an asshole, and your husband is sick of both of your shit, but now there is a huge rift that didnt need to be there \n\nit's time to leave Jr Highschool", "ESH what a ton of drama", "ESH\n\nYou did start shit here. Your husband is now mad at his friend over a lie. However, his friend seems a little too meddling for my liking, and what he said to you what a dick move.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Jake\u2019s accusing me of trying to cause issues between them by lying\" ...

He thinks his friend would have been a shallow tear without her and been dating models. Not everyone is a model.

There\u2019s not a lot of other ways to take it than that.", "He could have bagged a bunch of models....instead he settled for you.  IMHO.

Some guys can't get much action without a wingman before them to humanize themselves, and Jake sounds like the type who behaves in creepy ways towards women.", "Right? That part really confuses me. According to Jake, the husband used to be a bit of a dick... but husband and OP have been together since they were teenagers. Why does Jake think that without OP the husband would've become more of a dick? That sounds more like something you would say if they met later in life. \"You wouldn't have liked him back then, he was a bit of a dick\".", "Spot on! I think you've hit the nail on the head with your take on Jake.", "Fair point. Hubbie's reaction is interesting though bc he says to OP that he would have had a much different lifestyle if they didn't get married (ostensibly supporting Jake's claims) but then gets furious when Jake suggests the same thing.

Could be but the marriage seems pretty solid.", "But the different lifestyle the husband is referring to isn\u2019t necessarily the one Jake describes. Maybe he would have lived in a lot of different places or not have prioritized having a stable job if he weren\u2019t married young.", "Maybe OP's husband doesn't have the same vision of the different lifestyle that Jake is implicating.", "Husband may mean it in a positive way. I would have a very different lifestyle now if I hadn\u2019t met and stuck with my wife when I did, but it would have been a shitty lifestyle. OP\u2019s husband could be happy that he didn\u2019t end up a shallow serial womanizer like he might have.", "Valid but I thought it would have to do with romantic relationships as OP referenced it in the post.", "Valid but I thought it would have to do with romantic relationships as OP referenced it in the post and would most likely be about number of partners since they got together so young.", "I mean that would be the best scenario for OP. Hopefully hubby isn't thinking about all the women he could have been with. \n\nThat actually reminds me of a post recently where the OP was with wife since middle school,  had an affair,  got her pregnant and wife and daughters cut him off entirely. Plus, the wife was the one with money so he ended up in a shitty apartment with a woman he didn't like just bc he wanted the experience of sleeping with someone else."]}
