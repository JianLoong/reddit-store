Good on you for not enabling her using her diabetes to guilt you into giving her YOUR stuff. She is clearly going to live unhealthy, you don\u2019t have to cater to it.", "NTA. It was your chocolate, and a gift at that. She had no business even looking for it.", "NTA for the item in question (taking candies that were specifically a gift for you away because they're yours).  As you pointed out, she has plenty of other options for hypoglycemia treatment.\n\nI almost went with N A H because your mom initially said that she \"wasn't thinking straight\", and from your description, it sounds like she woke up from hypoglycemia (unless she's usually up that late), and I can attest that being woken up by hypoglycemia is horrible and thinking anything other than \"make it stop make it stop\"  (except perhaps \"OMG am I dying?\") is very, very difficult. So it does make sense that she might stumble out of bed (or to the kitchen) and just eat whatever she sees first without any consideration (e.g., who it belongs to, is it a gift, etc.) I can absolutely see that happening.\n\nHowever, then she not only went to eat your candy again *on purpose*, she then texted you because it wasn't there! That's certainly not accidental, emergency candy consumption, now is it? And it makes me question if she truly was disoriented at all the first time (she might have been, but I'm doubting that now).\n\nIn the future, you may want to avoid putting your candy in the common area at all.\n\nYou said your mother has disabilities, plural. Do her other conditions complicate her diabetes management? From your post, it sounds as if she has a Libra FreeStyle or something similar... it's a continuous monitor for blood sugar, and it can help people identify patterns related to their diabetes--also, for type 1 diabetes, no finger sticks, so that's a bonus. Anyone who has diabetes and literally any other condition that can mimic its symptoms can benefit from this. Hyperglycemia can cause fatigue/tiredness. What if you have another condition that also causes fatigue/tiredness as well as diabetes, and the fatigue has been getting worse? How do you know which one is to blame? A device like this can help with that. (I'm only familiar with using it for a short-term analysis, but I believe it can be used for longer periods.)\n\nAnyway, the beginning of your post makes it sound like you think your mother has this device because she can't remember to take her own blood sugar levels, but there are many reasons to use a device like this instead of finger sticks. You also implied that she doesn't follow the diet (by choice) and that's why she's on two types of insulin, but many people who have type 1 end up on a combination of insulins (short-acting, long-acting, etc.).\n\nManaging diabetes is **very** difficult, OP. If you're truly concerned she's not well educated, maybe you should attend her next endo appointment and listen to what her doctor has to say about it. In the meantime, you really need to stop judging your mom for struggling with her diabetes - most people who live with it do, and even those that find their footing can lose it when their hormones change (menopause or general aging).\n\nBut she's definitely TA for acting entitled to your candy because of her diabetes, OP. (Also, if she wasn't disoriented when she ate it the first time, she's also TA for stealing your candy and lying about it.)", "Nta - am also concerned for your mental welfare as your mother seems both dominating and manipulative.", "NTA\n\nWell done for not giving into her trying to guilt trip you with playing on her diabetes.", "NTA. as a pre-diabetic with blood sugar issues (that are luckily managed without insulin or monitoring, though i have other disabilities i need caretakers for) I pre-emptively plan for low sugar and keep sweets on me at all times. It was very rude of her to use something that was a gift to you, and the fact that she even asked for it after you took them away with plenty of other sugary food shows that she wasn't just fumbling around in the dark and ate the first sugary thing she grabbed; it was because she wanted chocolate, and is willing to take a gift from one of your friends.\nDo you think that having a list of the high-sugar foods in the house on a whiteboard or notepad something would be helpful to her if she has a low blood sugar attack again? Maybe not since like I said, it seems like she just wanted the chocolate, but worth mentioning in case it *would* help. I hope she at least replaces them. : (", "I was prepared to say YTA for the first half of it, but no, really no.\n\nNTA, sweety, enjoy your chocolate.", "NTA as it was yours to begin with. I will say as a diabetic people think we can't ever have anything sweet. That's not the case. You just have to remember the tradeoff with it and portion.

It can cause bad brain fog or even memory loss. My fiance is type one diabetic and when his numbers drop into the 50's or 40's it's like talking to a one year old. I have to put the juice in his hand and make sure he follows through with drinking because sometimes he'll just put it down and want to sleep, do whatever he wants to do except for drink the juice, or agrue like a child that he doesn't need it. It's not his normal personality and I don't take it personal because your body literally starts to shut down when blood sugar goes too low.\n\nOP is still NTA. If her mom has a sensor on her arm the default low number that will trigger the alarm is 50, but you can go into the app on your phone and set it higher. My fiance recently started using a sensor and he has his set at 65 or 70, so it gives him time to get something small to eat or drink before hitting the super low number that make him cognitively not there. His sensor he doesn't even have to scan it.

My mother told me on our last vacation that her blood sugar was low and she needed to go to the candy store, waited an hour to actually go (her choice) but would not eat any actual nutritious food that was immediately available (fruit, bread, cheese, cold cuts) along with a few sips of juice to rapidly raise it. \n\nShe also does not allow me to go to her doctor appointments. \n\nI judge my mom for her manipulation with her various ailments and for her refusal to take care of them unless it gets her something she wants.", "I second the whiteboard idea.

I am a dialysis nurse. If she has blood sugars that are all over the place, she is continually doing further damage. Does she take NSAIDs like Motrin? She is further damaging her kidneys. Does she tell other doctors about her CKD so they can properly dose medications. Eventually, she will end up in one of my chairs, unless she makes major changes. Is she obese?, Does she have high blood pressure? If so, does she take her BP meds correctly. These also can worsen her CKD over time. Is she vaccinated? She is immune compromised both from diabetes and from the CKD. 1 COVID infection increases her risk for AKI ( acute kidney injury) AKI on CKD often =ESRD.\n\n I have a T1D son, so I worry about this constantly. A CGM is a great tool for any type diabetic, because you don't have to constantly prick your finger  and it gives readings every 5 minutes so you get a trendline. It can show you how your body reacts to certain foods so you can use it to make better choices about food. If using the dexcom G6, you can even get an estimate of your A1C which shows how well you are controlling your blood sugars. \n\nMy uncle was in stage 4 and stated he would absolutely refuse dialysis. He worked with a doctor in Rochester who put him on a whole food vegan diet. He reversed his CKD to stage 3, lost 60 lbs and was able to come off some of his medications. The doctor published an article about it. If your mom wants to stay out of one of my chairs, she is going to have to work hard at it. The choices she is making do not sound like she is there yet. Please don't let her become complacent about her CKD because the doctor told her she has stabilized. She can put off dialysis for years or possibly the rest of her life, but only if she is vigilant about her blood sugars, diet, and medications. \n\nI was doing a research paper for college, according to the CDC kidney surveillance program.9/10 Americans don't know they have kidney disease. 5/10 who are 1 stage away from needing dialysis (stage V) do not know they have kidney disease. It's an easy disease to test for with a routine blood chemistry test and a urine albumin test. Not every doctor pays attention to the more subtle elevations in BUN and creatinine in early kidney disease. Unfortunately there are still many Americans who don't get regular physicals for a variety of reasons, which is why ESRD is increasing so dialysis costs every American 80,000 dollars because dialysis care is paid for through the Medicare trust fund for dialysis.

You consume a diet food with an artificial sweetener. It hits your tongue with a sweet taste. Your body responds by releasing insulin for the glucose it thinks it will have to metabolize. Then no glucose. This creates a craving for sugar because you have just created a biochemical reaction that will cause low blood sugars if you don't provide the glucose.
