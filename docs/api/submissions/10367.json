Good on you for not enabling her using her diabetes to guilt you into giving her YOUR stuff. She is clearly going to live unhealthy, you don\u2019t have to cater to it.", "NTA. It was your chocolate, and a gift at that. She had no business even looking for it.", "NTA for the item in question (taking candies that were specifically a gift for you away because they're yours).  As you pointed out, she has plenty of other options for hypoglycemia treatment.\n\nI almost went with N A H because your mom initially said that she \"wasn't thinking straight\", and from your description, it sounds like she woke up from hypoglycemia (unless she's usually up that late), and I can attest that being woken up by hypoglycemia is horrible and thinking anything other than \"make it stop make it stop\"  (except perhaps \"OMG am I dying?\") is very, very difficult. So it does make sense that she might stumble out of bed (or to the kitchen) and just eat whatever she sees first without any consideration (e.g., who it belongs to, is it a gift, etc.) I can absolutely see that happening.\n\nHowever, then she not only went to eat your candy again *on purpose*, she then texted you because it wasn't there! That's certainly not accidental, emergency candy consumption, now is it? And it makes me question if she truly was disoriented at all the first time (she might have been, but I'm doubting that now).\n\nIn the future, you may want to avoid putting your candy in the common area at all.\n\nYou said your mother has disabilities, plural. Do her other conditions complicate her diabetes management? From your post, it sounds as if she has a Libra FreeStyle or something similar... it's a continuous monitor for blood sugar, and it can help people identify patterns related to their diabetes--also, for type 1 diabetes, no finger sticks, so that's a bonus. Anyone who has diabetes and literally any other condition that can mimic its symptoms can benefit from this. Hyperglycemia can cause fatigue/tiredness. What if you have another condition that also causes fatigue/tiredness as well as diabetes, and the fatigue has been getting worse? How do you know which one is to blame? A device like this can help with that. (I'm only familiar with using it for a short-term analysis, but I believe it can be used for longer periods.)\n\nAnyway, the beginning of your post makes it sound like you think your mother has this device because she can't remember to take her own blood sugar levels, but there are many reasons to use a device like this instead of finger sticks. You also implied that she doesn't follow the diet (by choice) and that's why she's on two types of insulin, but many people who have type 1 end up on a combination of insulins (short-acting, long-acting, etc.).\n\nManaging diabetes is **very** difficult, OP. If you're truly concerned she's not well educated, maybe you should attend her next endo appointment and listen to what her doctor has to say about it. In the meantime, you really need to stop judging your mom for struggling with her diabetes - most people who live with it do, and even those that find their footing can lose it when their hormones change (menopause or general aging).\n\nBut she's definitely TA for acting entitled to your candy because of her diabetes, OP. (Also, if she wasn't disoriented when she ate it the first time, she's also TA for stealing your candy and lying about it.)", "Nta - am also concerned for your mental welfare as your mother seems both dominating and manipulative.", "NTA\n\nWell done for not giving into her trying to guilt trip you with playing on her diabetes.", "NTA. as a pre-diabetic with blood sugar issues (that are luckily managed without insulin or monitoring, though i have other disabilities i need caretakers for) I pre-emptively plan for low sugar and keep sweets on me at all times. It was very rude of her to use something that was a gift to you, and the fact that she even asked for it after you took them away with plenty of other sugary food shows that she wasn't just fumbling around in the dark and ate the first sugary thing she grabbed; it was because she wanted chocolate, and is willing to take a gift from one of your friends.\nDo you think that having a list of the high-sugar foods in the house on a whiteboard or notepad something would be helpful to her if she has a low blood sugar attack again?

I am a dialysis nurse. If she has blood sugars that are all over the place, she is continually doing further damage. Does she take NSAIDs like Motrin? She is further damaging her kidneys. Does she tell other doctors about her CKD so they can properly dose medications. Eventually, she will end up in one of my chairs, unless she makes major changes. Is she obese?, Does she have high blood pressure? If so, does she take her BP meds correctly. These also can worsen her CKD over time. Is she vaccinated? She is immune compromised both from diabetes and from the CKD. 1 COVID infection increases her risk for AKI ( acute kidney injury) AKI on CKD often =ESRD.\n\n I have a T1D son, so I worry about this constantly. A CGM is a great tool for any type diabetic, because you don't have to constantly prick your finger  and it gives readings every 5 minutes so you get a trendline. It can show you how your body reacts to certain foods so you can use it to make better choices about food. If using the dexcom G6, you can even get an estimate of your A1C which shows how well you are controlling your blood sugars. \n\nMy uncle was in stage 4 and stated he would absolutely refuse dialysis. He worked with a doctor in Rochester who put him on a whole food vegan diet. He reversed his CKD to stage 3, lost 60 lbs and was able to come off some of his medications. The doctor published an article about it. If your mom wants to stay out of one of my chairs, she is going to have to work hard at it. The choices she is making do not sound like she is there yet. Please don't let her become complacent about her CKD because the doctor told her she has stabilized. She can put off dialysis for years or possibly the rest of her life, but only if she is vigilant about her blood sugars, diet, and medications. \n\nI was doing a research paper for college, according to the CDC kidney surveillance program.9/10 Americans don't know they have kidney disease. 5/10 who are 1 stage away from needing dialysis (stage V) do not know they have kidney disease. It's an easy disease to test for with a routine blood chemistry test and a urine albumin test. Not every doctor pays attention to the more subtle elevations in BUN and creatinine in early kidney disease. Unfortunately there are still many Americans who don't get regular physicals for a variety of reasons, which is why ESRD is increasing so dialysis costs every American 80,000 dollars because dialysis care is paid for through the Medicare trust fund for dialysis.

Then no glucose. This creates a craving for sugar because you have just created a biochemical reaction that will cause low blood sugars if you don't provide the glucose.

My boyfriend is T1D and he has the freestyle libre. Honestly, it's sooo much easier for diabetics to use something that checks their sugar for them and alerts them when it's too high or going low. My boyfriend has his libre set to beep when his sugar is low or high so that he can take care of himself if needed. It's very beneficial at night because when he didn't have the libre due to insurance problems, his sugar would sometimes go low at night then we would wake up, have to hurry up and check his sugar, and give him some OJ, glucose tablets, etc to help bring his sugar back up. It also caused us to miss work a few times (thus losing some income in this scary economy) because it was bad enough that he wouldn't have been able to go into his physically demanding job.\n\nSo yes, your mom having a monitor in her arm is beneficial, especially if it alerts her to lows or highs. It's a tremendous help for my boyfriend and I. For him it's not that he forgets to check his blood sugar, but it's easier than taking his tester with him and having him to pull it out or make room where there's sometimes no room. He just puts it in and it helps make life just a tad bit easier for him.\n\nHowever, unlike your mom, my boyfriend actually does do what he can to take care of himself and doesn't pull the \"But I'm diabetic\" card to eat someone else's sweets unless it's an emergency, such as running low on groceries and needing something in that moment or risking his health. A few times he's had to eat sweets I was saving for myself but we also didn't have his glucose tablets (ran out) or OJ or other fast acting stuff because he used it previously or if it was food, his daughter might've nibbled on it for a quick snack or even myself with plans on purchasing more.\n\nOverall though, you're NTA.

They also likely would not make her an eligible candidate for transplant if she does not improve her health and work on her levels.", "Good luck with that, lol.\n\nShe's clearly not taking care of herself. It's going to progress as she gets older, especially if she continues her current behaviour.\n\nDid you hear the doctor say that, or did your mom say that?\n\nIs she following a renal diet as well as a diabetic diet? Is she avoiding meds that damage her kidneys, and making sure to get healthy exercise? How's her heart health?\n\nI work on a renal medicine ward. Lots of kidney transplants, HD and PD patients, etc. Your mom sounds like many of my patients. No interest in taking care of her diabetes unless it's an excuse for a snack, still keeping soda in the fridge (get rid of it. It's bad for kidneys and diabetes).\n\nDoes she understand how to take insulin correctly? A lot of people don't.\n\nI'm concerned for you in the future, as the burden of care you provide is only going to increase. Your mom needs to be responsible for her own diabetic health, and the fact that she's trying to put it on you (ie: the chocolate situation) tells me she's having difficulty with this.", "I totally understand this, but if she had the ability to text him about the chocolate the second time, then I really think she had the ability to get some juice or something that was there. I wouldn't hold the first time against her necessarily, but the second sounds more like a craving than a necessity.", "You have my condolances, OP. I hope your mom's refusal to take care of her own health will at least grant you a swift release from caretaking. I know that sounds callous and brutal, but your mom doesn't care what price her addict behavior extracts from you, so why should she get any sympathy?\n\nYou should really consider if this is the way YOU want to live your life, running around after a grown woman who's behaving like a toddler. If there are things you want to do that you are putting on hold to care for her, consider your life for the next 10, 15 years. Others here have described what it'll be like when (not if, when) she ends up on dialysis. She'll lose her feet, so you'll need to drive her around. She might go blind, so you'll have to do everything for her. Then, when she finally dies, you'll be left taking stock of your life and what you have paid for her refusal to be a responsible adult.", "One of the things my doctor told me after I was told I developed type 2 diabetes. If I get a low, go find juice, soda, or have those glucose tablets on me to bring up the levels. Chocolate will not help to up the glucose levels. They warned me about it because people kept eating it, thinking it would work, because it's sweet. Your mom should know this too. She just wanted to eat your chocolates and make you feel sorry for her.

She was just asking. When sending the text she was thinking clearly and TA, but while she was actively crashing I doubt she was thinking clearly if she was really in the 50's.\n\nI also said OP is NTA because the mom's sensor alarm can be raised so her blood sugar alarm goes off sooner and doesn't go that low before alerting her and she has other options like juice. She may not even know her sensor can be set to alert her sooner if she is not tech savvy. You pretty much repeated what I said in my orginal message.", "It just feels very telling that she never mentions these episodes unless she\u2019s defending herself. She didn\u2019t tell me she had a low period until I asked about the chocolate. I walked by it that morning and I feel like if it had been opened then I would have noticed but I can\u2019t be certain. I feel like she ate it while I was at work and the whole thing is made up.", "I tell my patients they have to stop drinking dark sodas because they are high in phosphorus. If they need caffeinated soda, drink mountain dew. Do you have a recliner. Have her sit in it with her feet up for 3.5 hours. She is not allowed to eat except for a small snack like lunchbox goldfish or popcorn as well as only a 4 oz bottle of water. She can't get out of the chair at all during that time. That is what dialysis is for the patient. 3x a week. Some larger patients will be on 4 hour treatments. Whatever gets adequate clearance. Usually a 32 oz or less fluid restriction. Low potassium, low sodium, low phos diet. So high K foods are bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, watermelon, pickles, cruciform veggies like broccoli and cabbage, etc. High phos foods include all dairy, a lot of lunch meats use phos as a preservative, bacon. Liquids include soup, ice, anything that melts at room temp. Right now she should be on a low protein diet to spare her kidneys. If they fail, then she would need a high protein diet. She will become anemic, although we will treat it on dialysis, sometimes that requires blood transfusions. She won't be eligible for transplant, even with a living donor, unless she is no longer obese, completely vaccinated, and compliant with all treatments and meds. As a diabetic, her A1C would need to be below 8. Missing dialysis treatments would count against her. All trips would need to be scheduled in advance so the clinic social worker can schedule transient dialysis in a clinic near the location she is going to. Dialysis sucks, it's much easier to do the work to stay out of the chair.", "It's not your job to. I have a mother with health issues and when I lived with her it was a fight to get her to schedule a doctor appointment or get walk-in imaging or blood work. I don't live with her anymore and she's fighting me to even switch pharmacies so she doesn't have to pay for delivery. I can't force myself to put in effort if she refuses, so I dropped it.

You didn't take away the only candy in the house, or even HER candy.  You took your own chocolate to work with you.

From the title I was all ready to yell at you, but because there are other options available, you\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think she is TA for eating it in the first place because honestly at 2 am sometimes when you\u2019re blood sugar is that low you don\u2019t think things through at all and especially that late you\u2019re just literally so ready to go back to bed that you don\u2019t always make the best decisions. That being said, for low blood sugars in general chocolate is not the best choice. The fat in it makes it take longer for the body to absorb. If she\u2019s truly in a hypoglycemic moment, foods like juice, gummy\u2019s, hard candies or glucose gel/tabs are much better at getting her up quickly. I have chocolate at home as I like it and like everyone occasionally want some but I never use it as a treatment for a low.", "op=NTA\n\nThis is an excuse, chocolate candies is not the go-to esp with all the stuff you have available(oj being the recommended option by medical community).\n\nAnd that's not even counting, that it's YOUR candy not hers.

She wants your candy because it's yummy.", "[removed]", "NTA\nI mean she clearly wants to go into a diabetic coma so maybe you should let her. She needs some proper education on this topic, could you contact a diabetic association and see if they have any help available?

Your brain feels like mush and you feel just so miserable you just do what you need to. Middle of the night lows are usually a lot harder too just because you don\u2019t feel them until you wake up and then when you wake up you feel them feel them. Some of these comments are a little insensitive (not yours) to the fact that when you\u2019re low, you\u2019re not always thinking clearly. She does need to up her settings on her cgm though because really if you\u2019re wearing a cgm like you said there\u2019s absolutely no reason she shouldn\u2019t be alerted.

It runs in both sides of my family (T2) and I've seen the downsides (blindness, amputations, strokes) and I have personally had DKA several times (nearly died from it once.) Yes, it's hard to change eating habits, but it can be done. She's got to be willing to acknowledge her disease and be willing to adapt, or things will not improve.", "Ah, I understand now. When I first read your post, OP, I thought she had Type 1 Diabetes, which can be evilly frustrating. But now I know she has Type 2 + kidney issues, which is why she's using insulin to treat it.\n\nI was told that I should drink orange juice, then follow it up with cheese or Greek yogurt, etc. once I stop feeling like crap from the low blood sugar. The first time I drank the juice then went back to bed... only to wake up feeling like crap again only a few hours later... taught me not to skip the cheese. It seems like your mother isn't changing her behavior despite negative results.\n\nTBH, it's really difficult to believe *anyone* would elect to have hyper- and hypoglycemia, having experienced both myself (and they suck), but it's hard to see it any other way when the indivudal in question treats with insulin yet doesn't realize they haven't been testing their blood sugar (???).", "Wouldn't you go for something that you knew in the past was there?

Logic isn\u2019t always there with lows that\u2019s the only point I was making. I\u2019m not saying the mom is in the right because clearly the second day is indicative of that that she was using her diabetes to get the chocolate, but had she just had the low and ate the chocolate I can understand how it would happen as someone who has also had like 6 Graham crackers at 2 am after waking up with a 50.
