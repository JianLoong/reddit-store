My partner said he was unsure at the time and I told our friends that we would think about it. A few weeks went by, I asked my partner again, and he said he wasn't interested. I mentioned that I would still like to go. I asked if he was cool with this because we have two small children and coordinating care takes effort. At the time he told me he was okay with it, but I waited to buy my ticket to make sure that I still wanted to go to the event. Fast forward a few weeks I told him I was buying my ticket, and again he did not say he was opposed. \n\nNow it is a few days before the event and I could tell he is upset. When I asked him, he said that he's not looking forward to the evening because it is at bedtime and is a challenging time for our family. Our youngest is 2 months old and our oldest is 2.5y/o. Our toddler recently has had a sleep regression and you need to lay in bed with them until they are sleep which can take 30 minutes to 1 hour. \n\nHe said it was discourteous of me to buy the tickets knowing how difficult it will be to have both children by himself at bedtime. He said he has purposely avoided events that he wanted to go to because he did not want to leave me alone at this time. I agreed that was kind of him, but I wish he would have communicated this the several times I asked him about the concert the past few weeks.\n\nI have been on maternity leave for 10 weeks and have been looking forward to a night out. I didn't find the request unreasonable, although I do agree it can be challenging. Another detail is I have also been home alone with both children the last 4 days because of illness(I was ill while caring for the children) and our toddler not being able to go to daycare. I did feel overwhelmed at the thought at first, hoping I would be able to entertain them and balance care. We ended up having a wonderful few days together, although yes, at times chaotic. \n\nI offered to sell  my ticket and he said he didn't want me to do that. I told him that I would not go to the event if he was seriously overwhelmed and anxious about bedtime and evening by himself with the children. I told him I understand it's a hard time of day but I would have not bought the tickets if I didn't think that he could do it. Our lives are chaotic right now and it is hard with two small children. But I don't think it's unreasonable to leave the house for four to five hours one evening. \n\nThe last conversation we had he said \"I already know it's going to be a terrible evening\" \n\nEdit: My partner and I equally divide the workload for the kids, especially at night. Neither of us have done bedtime solo, I think that's what he's specifically stressed about. \n\nAITA for leaving my partner solo to care for the toddler and baby at bedtime?", "created_utc": 1674661846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l1s3l/aita_for_going_to_a_concert_leaving_my_partner_to/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You checked again, he didn't object. You checked Again, still no objection.\n\nToo late to object, he objects. \n\nAlso, He's Their Parent Too. And it's literally 1 evening.\n\nYour partner can get over himself, you're NTA", "NTA. He should have actually communicated and not been passive aggressive. He's their father, time to do some parenting for one night.", "So.. he doesn't want to sell the tickets, he doesn't want you to not go, but he doesn't want you to go? Well then.. what does he want? \n\nNTA. You asked. Multiple times. He could have expressed at any time that he wasn't ok with it. Even if he wasn't ok with it, you're a new mom of 2. You need some time to go out and be with other adults. Have some fun!", "NTA. You asked several times and he said it was fine. Over to give him a night off so he can go out with with friends to even it out", "NTA.  He is their father!  He chose not just once, but twice, to bring children into the world.  What did he expect?  That he would never have to care for them for even a few hours?\n\nHusband seems to have a very 1950s view of fatherhood, as well as a truly crappy communication style.", "NTA.  You asked, he said it was fine.  He can handle the kids for one night.  You should also encourage him to go out one night himself too.  \n\nAlso, not that you asked so feel free to stop reading here, but you are setting yourself up for years of sleep misery with your toddler.  If you do not want to have to lay down with them for hours for years you should stop doing it now.  Toddlers are terrorists.  Don't negotiate with terrorists.", "You did say \"partner\" right?  So yeah.  That's what he is and \"partner\" is exactly what it means.\n\nNTA\n\nI hope you have SO much fun at the concert!", "I'm going with NTA- you asked him twice if he was okay with you going and didn't object. You've had to care of the kids alone for 4 days before, he can handle a few hour of one night. It sounds like your partner does not pull his weight with childcare and now when he is being asked to step up and do his part he is pushing back. Go and have fun at the concert, your partner will be fine. A good opportunity for him to learn how to handle the kids on his own because this won't be the last time he has to care for the kids without you. Better get comfortable now", "NTA. You asked multiple times before buying the tickets, and were given permission. He could have spoken up sooner. \n\nAlso, has your partner really never put your children to bed? After 10 weeks, does he not know how to do it? \n\nI hear you that it\u2019s not easy, but not being able to manage for a single night, even if it\u2019s not *fun* per se is\u2026sure something. \n\nMore importantly, you communicated clearly, and he told you to go. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. He did, but guilting you after the fact, for something *he* explicitly gave you his blessing to do. \n\nIgnore his guilt trips and enjoy your concert. You deserve a fun night out!", "NTA. It may well be a difficult few hours for your partner to deal with such young children by himself at bedtime, but welcome to Parenthood. That's just part of the job. You do what you can to get the toddler and baby to sleep and if they don't,  the world doesn't end. You gave him every opportunity to oppose your going to the concert, but he didn't object, so go, have a good time and don't worry. They're his kids too and he has to be able to look after them by himself.", "NTA, as the father he needs to be able to do that. Sure in this case he doesn't HAVE to do it, but he should learn to do it regardless. It's not going to be fun, but at least you will get a good night out of it. Say thank you, instead of I'm sorry and enjoy yourself.", "NTA. You checked in with him on this several times and it wasn't until you had already pulled the trigger and bought the ticket that he expressed that he didn't want you to go. His accusation that it was discourteous of you to buy the tickets is absolute crap - you gave him several opportunities to express concern and he didn't until after you had already committed to going to the show. He signed up to be a parent, which inevitably comes with some stressful, difficult nights and it isn't fair for him to expect you to never get a break because he doesn't want to be uncomfortable and have some parenting stress for one night.", "NTA you deserve time to yourself without kids to recharge.", "NTA especially because your partner is pulling a really AH move by being passive-aggressive in his communication.\n\nLike, put everything else aside for a sec about how as a father, he needs to be able to handle his children. Just focus on the fact that you raised this topic MULTIPLE times and he's telling you \"go but don't go, I'm going to be unhappy anyway, but don't mind me\". That's such childish behavior on his part! He needs to grow up.", "NTA!!!! Moms deserve a night out. Raising kids is HARD and you do it every day and night. ESP the point you made about them and you being sick. He can deal with it and he\u2019ll survive. NTA!!!", "NTA.\n\nI've been in his position - it can be tough. That's what I signed up for when I had kids, and making sure my partner wasn't saddled with the whole burden is what I'd signed up for when I found a partner.\n\nYou checked before buying the tickets, he was ok with it then, that's on him.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner's anxiety is normal though. He's anticipating handling something by himself he hasn't done before.\n\nSo be kind but also follow through with your plans. Encourage him, tell him he's got this, help with some contingency planning if things don't go as expected. AND then be sure to send him out some evening to do something with his friends so he can have a little social time too.\n\nThe anxiety will decrease the more you guys practice letting the other one have some time out of the house.", "Nta . But after you night out I think you should talk. Cause \n1/ ok it\u2019s stressful but would you be THAT anxious in the same situation? It seems no, so maybe he is a bit overreacting? \n2/ you give him the opportunities to tell you if he was ok and decide to say nothing and then start to be unfair.\n3/ he said he declined this kind of event, maybe he can give exemples. Was it recently ? Cause yes. You just had a baby so it\u2019s normal he stay with you. before ? Why didn\u2019t he tell you.", "NTA. He can suck it up for __one night__.", "**NTA** your husband is so wishy washy and passive aggressive with the way he's handling this. He just wants to make you feel guilty for going to the concert so he's saying all those things. He's also a parent and although i know it's hard to take care of kids, you were able to do so alone WHILE sick. Go the concert and have fun seriously.", "NTA. Your partner said it was fine _and you asked twice_. It's all on him. End of story. If you can't be straight and honest in your relationship, what's the point?", "NTA He will manage. It\u2019s only one night. It will do you the world of good to get out for the night.", "Nta if he doesn't want you to do something, you partner actually has to *communicate*.   You offered a solution, selling the ticket, and he refused.\n\nSounds like he just wants to be a martyr.   'Poor me, woe is me!  My wife left me all alone for one night to care for my own children!\" \n\nLet me go get the world's tiniest violin.", "NTA - he should have voiced his opinion in the multiple times you asked him.  You are being a very caring partner to even be as understanding to this - God forbid he has to take care of the children alone.  Also - if you go into a situation with nothing but a negative mindset, that is going to set the tone.\n\nI also have a feeling that even if the night goes well for him he is going to paint the picture that it was terrible - he sounds like the type.  Good luck and enjoy your concert!", "NTA\n\n1. He will be fine. \n2. He could have spoken up on numerous occasions and chose not to.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable to expect that both of you will occasionally be able to get a nigh free. It sounds like you asked him several times beforehand, and he had the opportunity multiple times to say no. Although it's hard to put two small children to bed, that is part of parenting that everyone has to learn to be able to do solo. What if a medical emergency happened and you were in the hospital or something?\n\nAs long as you would be willing to do the same for him, so that he could have a night to himself, I don't see that you did anything wrong here.", "NTA, you communicated. Your spouse did not. It is on him, and you even offered to sell your ticket.", "NTA\n\nhe will be fine, he has to learn how to take care of them alone and you deserve a nice night out", "NTA in the slightest. \n\nYou have been home with both kids for the past few months, you deserve a break.  \n\nYou asked not once, but twice, before buying tickets to make sure your SO was ok with you going.  \n\nWorst case, it\u2019s a bad night.  Best case, your SO does fine and it\u2019ll help their confidence. \n\nEnjoy your evening guilt free", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou asked him before you bought the tickets on more than one occasion. I know he is now anxious, but he would have to do this at sometime. \n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t return to work for 4 months, I was the Secretary for a Residents Association and still had to take the minutes every other month. I was lucky in that I actually went into labour at a meeting, so it was 2 months before the next and my husband had to look after the children (nearly 4yo and a 2 month old) for 3 hours that evening (7:30pm start). He coped.", "NTA. He had so many opportunities to speak up about his stress. He will survive.

You both need time for yourselves. Make sure he gets a night out too.", "NTA\nEnjoy your time with your friends. Your partner thinks that you can handle both kids while sick, so he can handle them once while healthy.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSleep regression can happen out of nowhere. You asked him several times and he okay-ed you to go. He's just mad now because he feels it's not going to be easy. Guess what?? Having a poor attitude will guarantee that outcome. Also you never leave him alone with the kids to handle night time activities. Start doing it more often. He's being a bad partner. What about all the times you handle the kids on your own??.\n\nGo to your concert. Have a good time. Don't answer phone calls. Minimum text messages. Don't hurry home. You're entitled to have a social life and time away from your kids.", "NTA. You asked (multiple times even!) and he said he was fine. There was open communication.

It\u2019s one evening, you asked if he was okay with it, and it\u2019s not like you expect this from him regularly.", "NTA..whatever you do do not sell that ticket. He is perfectly capable of doing bedtime, even with issues. Go and enjoy yourself", "NTA.\n\nYou gave him plenty of time to tell you he needed you at home before you bought the ticket, and he didnt. Now he is guilt tipping you about how hard it will be right before its happening, but also tell you to go, but gives you a dig about knowing how hard it will be? Holding over your head that he (supposedly) hasnt done things he wanted to do to be nice to you? Thats mean. He is being mean.\n\nHe set you up for failure as soon as he refused to communicate his feelings untill you had the tickets.", "NTA\n\nIf he can\u2019t handle the kids alone for **one single night** then he shouldn\u2019t have became a parent. He\u2019s allowed to be anxious about it, sure. But he\u2019s acting like you\u2019re leaving for weeks. You just took care of both kids all day for 4 days by yourself while sick. \n\nAlso, if you have an infant and toddler, in the last 3 years you\u2019ve been pregnant for 18 months, aka half of that time. You\u2019re not pregnant now, and deserve a night out. Have fun and enjoy it, and see if your husband can go out for a night soon too. Or maybe a date night.", "He's being very passive aggressive.   I don't think it's wrong for either of you to get night out, just unfortunate you can't take the night off together.

Sometimes the new parent anxiety paints everything with a worst-possible-scenario brush.\n\nI'm willing to bet that when push comes to shove the night will have some hiccups but will over all go smoothly enough and he will feel better about his abilities to care for your kids during bedtime (even by himself) after it's done. If this really is the very first time either of you has pulled a one parent bedtime than I think it's understandable for him to be a little scared, even if he really should be able to talk himself through that experience in a more adult way, or at least express his fears to you in a more measured fashion. Either way, my bet is all ends fine, and his confidence is boosted at the end, which gives you a really good opportunity to come home and say \"I love how beautifully you handled the night, and I'm so grateful I got to have this evening. I know I've been feeling nervous too about my first bedtime alone with the kids, but between my last few days home with them while we were sick, and seeing how great you did with them tonight, I know we're both rocking this parenting thing.\"", "NTA.

Pathetic.\n\nTell your partner the internet is disappointed in him.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nDoes your husband know a father and babysitter are two different things? Does he expect for you to stay home till they\u2019re old enough to take care of themselves alone? \n\nI\u2019d start setting more expectations for him or find a new partner who would actually be a parent to your kids and not find them to be a chore when you\u2019re out. \n\nAlso red flag\u2026.

You asked again and again. At some point if you aren't going to stand by your words then what is the point of trying to communicate. He said it was fine so go have fun. Maybe next time he will be honest about how he feels.", "NTA as the father of two kids all I can say is yes, he is right, it is tough. But it's all tough. It's tough for everyone but we all do have to suck it up and just get on with it. This is being a parent. Both of you need to be able to take a night off and know that the other is capable enough to handle it. You're lucky, beyond his griping it seems he's well capable of actually doing it. Just encourage that. Tell him he's an awesome dad who's got this, he can totally do it.

Didn\u2019t work out and that wasn\u2019t in the script.  \n\nHe is exploring all the ways he can maneuver you into being confined to the home as the parent without any of the oppressive aspects if that being seen as his acting entitled.  \n\nGood luck", "NTA. But your husband is a guilt-tripping AH who needs to learn how to DAD on his own just like you had to MOM on your own while he's at work. Go enjoy your concert!", "Why don\u2019t you try doing solo bedtimes prior to the evening out? This will give him the confidence he needs and you will know that he can manage otherwise you will be thinking about this whilst out.\n\nIt\u2019s all anxiety related, I have 3 grown up children but there was 3 under 5 yrs old. We would take in turns even though we were both home with the other there if needed.\n\nTbh I was very scared with a newborn but my husband just got in with it, very capable so I can relate to your husband.", "NTA you asked and he agreed. My husband and I try to do this somewhat often. It\u2019s good for you to get out and for him to figure out bedtime. Hopefully something that interests him will come up soon and you can try it in reverse.", "NTA - you asked multiple times and he assented every time. I think now it is a reality, it is major cold feet and he's panicking. But you are going to have times where only one can do bedtime so not bad learning experience. \n\nAs to his martyrdom by turning down events so as not to burden you, he took your opportunity to decide whether it was really too much or not from you. So I am not sure why you owe him anything for making decisions without talking to you. He assumed a burden, you discussed it after managing sole care yourself for a period of time. Are you partners or is he used to making all the decisions? \n\nHowever, he is upset about putting two small children to bed on own. He is a responsible parent so it is this one aspect he's worried about. So trial runs might help but do it first so he can't sabotage you, consciously or not.", "ESH, he really needs to be more upfront with his communication, and stop saying things he doesn't mean. It's very obvious he doesn't want you to go. You really shouldn't be leaving your 2 month old already, that's too young.", "Info: \n\n>Our toddler recently has had a sleep regression\n\nHow recently? Has this changed since you asked if he was OK with you going? I don't think either of you are AHs, I think he is just scared. And I bet you would be as well if you were planning to do your first solo put down when the toddler is in a tricky sleep patch.", "Sounds like there's three babies in your house and you're not one of them. NTA", "NTA, I wonder is there time, can you try to do the bedtime on your own before the concert?", "NTA - father here, and it sounds like u did all the right things (asking, checking in, offering to cancel if it was truly necessary etc). He's stressed about it because as you pointed out it's overwhelming with those kiddos for anyone at that age (I have 3). \n\nI would just make sure yall are on the same page about these types of nights. In our house we don't do things like that which are just for fun. And if we do, we do them together and find a sitter etc. If there's something truly unique/important then of course we do it and accommodate, but usually we don't just go blow off steam at the expense of the other parent. Sounds like that is his perspective (not going to some events) so just make sure yall land on the same page.", "This!", ">  He is their father! \n\n\"This\" - _so much_. I _hate_ when any of my friends or coworkers would say \"oh, you're babysitting?\" \"No, they're _my_ kids!\"", "Ha! Toddlers sure do hold you hostage at this age! We are taking steps for a better night time routine. They had been sleeping great and are going through a regression. Hopefully it does not last. We've been trying all the sleep tips and tricks to get back on track", "Thank you for your reply. It's a hard time of life right now!", "Thank you so much for your reply. It gives a good perspective and I like your suggested support statement.", "That's exactly how I felt afterwards having them both home while I didn't feel well. It confirmed I can do it!", "Yeah, this. I remember when the kid was young feeling scared to do it all on my own but it's totally possible. It's just a bit daunting.", "He's actually very hands on and we divide and conquer the evenings evenly. So I was a bit surprised by his reaction. I think bedtime specifically is what is stressing him. Neither of us have done it solo yet.", "He used up all his sick time at work to take paternity leave when our baby was born. Since I'm still on leave I stayed home with them.", "This is not a red flag, sick parents have to take care of sick kids all.the.time. Especially when both usually work. She\u2019s on maternity leave.", "I agree, we have been actively working to make better sleep habits for our kiddo. It's a process but we are trying!", "This makes sense. I was definitely apprehensive doing it for a few days solo too.", "Soo parents should be expected to stay home 24/7 when a new baby is born? Seems unhealthy. Everyone deserves a break. Especially new moms.", "Do you think a 2 month old needs 2 parents at all times? Because it seems that the father works every day based on her comment that she\u2019s on maternity leave, while not mentioning his leave. So your logic is that a father can\u2019t take care of their child as well as the mother? Newsflash: dad\u2019s aren\u2019t babysitters, they\u2019re exactly as capable as caring for their children as a mother\u2026 or they should be.", "I already responded to this comment, but I literally had to come back again because I am *reeling* from this.", "That's insane.  It's a few hours!  He leaves for work every day.  There is no difference.  Every mom Needs a break.  I'm glad she's getting one!", "What?? She's not leaving her two-month-old *alone*, she's leaving the two-month-old with *their father*. Would you be saying this if OP was a SAHM and left alone with both kids most of the time? No. Because it's completely unreasonable to expect that all two-month-olds will have both parents with them at all times. Imagine.", ">You really shouldn't be leaving your 2 month old already, that's too young.\n\nWhat?? Too young for what??? They work. They should be going out. What do you think happens when you have a child?? They are supposed to stay by their side 24/7 for the first year? Can't take a shower by themselves?? Grocery shop? Doctor appointments? Work??", "Why exactly shouldn't she be able to leave the baby with its other parent?  A few hours away is not going to hurt the baby.", "She's not dumping the two month old on a babysitter, the baby will be with their FATHER. It's up to her if the baby is too young to do without her or not for a few hours.", "It\u2019s literally a few hours.  He\u2019s doing it every day for work.  How is one leaving ok but not the other??", "you handle everything with the kids every other night", "It is hard! I've been there. I think there is a line where you can be compassionate to the anxiety he is experiencing (it's a valid emotion) and firm on that you also both need to be able to do things for yourselves. Once you are both confident in your ability to look after the kids, it becomes no big deal to let your partner go out for the evening here and there. You can tell him how you used to get anxious doing this kind of thing too and it does get better by doing it. Also at the end of the day, if it doesn't go perfectly it doesn't mean he failed. Enjoy your concert :)", "It is hard and you\u2019re all still adjusting to having 2 kids. But you\u2019re right in your thinking and it\u2019s not realistic to have all hands on deck 24/7 forever. My husband does the same thing of deciding ahead of time something will be awful and that behavior can be frustrating, but hopefully he\u2019ll come out the other side better for it and more confident. It\u2019s just new right now and it\u2019s hard.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Can he \u201cpractice\u201d putting the kids to bed by himself before the concert? It might help the kids (and him) feel more confident.\n\nAlso, NTA. He needs to know how to do this on his own. What would he do if you had an emergency and could not be home for whatever reason? He would just have to suck it up and get it done. He needs to do the same in this situation as well. You deserve to have a night out without the kids.", "Me too- especially if either of the kids are currently breast fed. It was fine in principle, but I remember panicking a few times that I didn't have that as an option if things went wrong!!", "Hmm, if only you guys knew that this concert was coming up so he could practice solo bedtime beforehand in preparation for the event...oh wait.\n\nNTA. He's an adult. If you can't rely on him to figure this out (whether it be calling in people to help, doing research, or practising in advance) your relationship is doomed. What will happen when there's a real emergency and you can't rely on him to step up?", "There\u2019s a first time for everything and it has to come eventually. You checked in with him and he\u2019s just stressed but he\u2019s got this. You enjoy your night out, mama.\n\nNAH", "Also, his attitude of \"its going to be terrible already\" is going to truly mess up the whole evening. If he expects it to suck, it will. He will be grouchy and irritable and losing his patience. If he goes into thinking he gets quality time with his kids and makes his own fun, he will have a much better time.\n\nThis is the chance to build a blanket fort or have breakfast for dinner or start some fun daddy-daughter traditions.", "I totally hear this but no matter how hands on he is, dads always have freedoms that moms don\u2019t.  Don\u2019t feel guilty about your decision.", "Is a babysitter or friend coming over in the evening to help him not an option? If he wants you to be able to go to the concert but doesn't think he can handle taking care of the kids on his own then that seems like something he should have prepared for beforehand.", "How classic of reddit to always assume the worst of the dad with no evidence.", "So you watch both all the time while he\u2019s at work?", "I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about that. Your eldest has just had a major upheaval in their life, it\u2019s bound to make them push boundaries and even regress at times. They also may use bedtime as that\u2019s the only one to one time they get won\u2019t their parent now theirs a new baby.\n\nNo judgement, my three year old did the same thing when his sister was born. Took a bit of time, but they\u2019re back to their normal routine now. \n\nNTA by the way, you asked if it was ok several times. Your husband should have used his words and told you no, not guilt you later on. That\u2019s not fair.", "Exactly don't feel guilty at all. I get it that you've both never done it solo, but he'll manage! OP will inevitably do it herself as well. This is what happens when you have kiddos so close together. Sleep times can be chaotic. It'll really probably be with just the 2-year-old really. The baby is a couple of months old and will probably eat, shit and fall asleep, haha. Then focus on the toddler. He's being pessimistic when he'll most likely be fine.", "I had this in my original post but had to make room for an edit. Normally my mother-in-law could come but she is currently sick. And the other friend that helps us with child care is coming to the concert.", "I typically work full time but I am home with the baby while still on maternity leave. Our toddler usually goes to daycare. Occasionally I have them both, but normally just the baby.", "You don't have to make room for an edit, the character limit only applies when you first post.", "That's unfortunate but still, none of this is on you. If he actually expressed his concerns one of the multiple times you checked with him, some sort of arrangement could have been made beforehand, such as hiring a babysitter to help for the night.", "You know who needed his mom to come help with the children? My grandfather, a man from rural Italy born in the 30s. I sure hope your husband is from our generation and can handle his own kids by himself for a few hours."]}
