My partner said he was unsure at the time and I told our friends that we would think about it. A few weeks went by, I asked my partner again, and he said he wasn't interested. I mentioned that I would still like to go. I asked if he was cool with this because we have two small children and coordinating care takes effort. At the time he told me he was okay with it, but I waited to buy my ticket to make sure that I still wanted to go to the event. Fast forward a few weeks I told him I was buying my ticket, and again he did not say he was opposed. \n\nNow it is a few days before the event and I could tell he is upset. When I asked him, he said that he's not looking forward to the evening because it is at bedtime and is a challenging time for our family. Our youngest is 2 months old and our oldest is 2.5y/o. Our toddler recently has had a sleep regression and you need to lay in bed with them until they are sleep which can take 30 minutes to 1 hour. \n\nHe said it was discourteous of me to buy the tickets knowing how difficult it will be to have both children by himself at bedtime. He said he has purposely avoided events that he wanted to go to because he did not want to leave me alone at this time. I agreed that was kind of him, but I wish he would have communicated this the several times I asked him about the concert the past few weeks.\n\nI have been on maternity leave for 10 weeks and have been looking forward to a night out. I didn't find the request unreasonable, although I do agree it can be challenging. Another detail is I have also been home alone with both children the last 4 days because of illness(I was ill while caring for the children) and our toddler not being able to go to daycare. I did feel overwhelmed at the thought at first, hoping I would be able to entertain them and balance care. We ended up having a wonderful few days together, although yes, at times chaotic. \n\nI offered to sell  my ticket and he said he didn't want me to do that. I told him that I would not go to the event if he was seriously overwhelmed and anxious about bedtime and evening by himself with the children. I told him I understand it's a hard time of day but I would have not bought the tickets if I didn't think that he could do it. Our lives are chaotic right now and it is hard with two small children. But I don't think it's unreasonable to leave the house for four to five hours one evening. \n\nThe last conversation we had he said \"I already know it's going to be a terrible evening\" \n\nEdit: My partner and I equally divide the workload for the kids, especially at night. Neither of us have done bedtime solo, I think that's what he's specifically stressed about. \n\nEdit #2: We have been actively trying to adjust to a normal bedtime routine for our toddler. They are in a regression. They have a new sibling in the house and it's a big adjustment. We are trying our best to eventually not need to lay with them at bedtime. It's a temporary measure. \n\nAITA for leaving my partner solo to care for the toddler and baby at bedtime?", "created_utc": 1674661846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l1s3l/aita_for_going_to_a_concert_leaving_my_partner_to/", "score": 400, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You checked again, he didn't object. You checked Again, still no objection.\n\nToo late to object, he objects. \n\nAlso, He's Their Parent Too. And it's literally 1 evening.\n\nYour partner can get over himself, you're NTA", "NTA. He should have actually communicated and not been passive aggressive. He's their father, time to do some parenting for one night.", "So.. he doesn't want to sell the tickets, he doesn't want you to not go, but he doesn't want you to go? Well then.. what does he want? \n\nNTA. You asked. Multiple times. He could have expressed at any time that he wasn't ok with it. Even if he wasn't ok with it, you're a new mom of 2. You need some time to go out and be with other adults. Have some fun!", "NTA. You asked several times and he said it was fine. Over to give him a night off so he can go out with with friends to even it out", "NTA.  He is their father!  He chose not just once, but twice, to bring children into the world.  What did he expect?  That he would never have to care for them for even a few hours?\n\nHusband seems to have a very 1950s view of fatherhood, as well as a truly crappy communication style.", "NTA.  You asked, he said it was fine.  He can handle the kids for one night.  You should also encourage him to go out one night himself too.  \n\nAlso, not that you asked so feel free to stop reading here, but you are setting yourself up for years of sleep misery with your toddler.  If you do not want to have to lay down with them for hours for years you should stop doing it now.  Toddlers are terrorists.  Don't negotiate with terrorists.", "You did say \"partner\" right?  So yeah.  That's what he is and \"partner\" is exactly what it means.\n\nNTA\n\nI hope you have SO much fun at the concert!", "I'm going with NTA- you asked him twice if he was okay with you going and didn't object. You've had to care of the kids alone for 4 days before, he can handle a few hour of one night. It sounds like your partner does not pull his weight with childcare and now when he is being asked to step up and do his part he is pushing back. Go and have fun at the concert, your partner will be fine. A good opportunity for him to learn how to handle the kids on his own because this won't be the last time he has to care for the kids without you. Better get comfortable now", "NTA. You asked multiple times before buying the tickets, and were given permission. He could have spoken up sooner. \n\nAlso, has your partner really never put your children to bed? After 10 weeks, does he not know how to do it? \n\nI hear you that it\u2019s not easy, but not being able to manage for a single night, even if it\u2019s not *fun* per se is\u2026sure something. \n\nMore importantly, you communicated clearly, and he told you to go. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. He did, but guilting you after the fact, for something *he* explicitly gave you his blessing to do. \n\nIgnore his guilt trips and enjoy your concert. You deserve a fun night out!", "NTA. It may well be a difficult few hours for your partner to deal with such young children by himself at bedtime, but welcome to Parenthood. That's just part of the job. You do what you can to get the toddler and baby to sleep and if they don't,  the world doesn't end. You gave him every opportunity to oppose your going to the concert, but he didn't object, so go, have a good time and don't worry. They're his kids too and he has to be able to look after them by himself.", "NTA, as the father he needs to be able to do that. Sure in this case he doesn't HAVE to do it, but he should learn to do it regardless. It's not going to be fun, but at least you will get a good night out of it. Say thank you, instead of I'm sorry and enjoy yourself.", "NTA. You checked in with him on this several times and it wasn't until you had already pulled the trigger and bought the ticket that he expressed that he didn't want you to go. His accusation that it was discourteous of you to buy the tickets is absolute crap - you gave him several opportunities to express concern and he didn't until after you had already committed to going to the show. He signed up to be a parent, which inevitably comes with some stressful, difficult nights and it isn't fair for him to expect you to never get a break because he doesn't want to be uncomfortable and have some parenting stress for one night.", "NTA you deserve time to yourself without kids to recharge.", "NTA especially because your partner is pulling a really AH move by being passive-aggressive in his communication.\n\nLike, put everything else aside for a sec about how as a father, he needs to be able to handle his children. Just focus on the fact that you raised this topic MULTIPLE times and he's telling you \"go but don't go, I'm going to be unhappy anyway, but don't mind me\". That's such childish behavior on his part! He needs to grow up.", "NTA!!!! Moms deserve a night out. Raising kids is HARD and you do it every day and night. ESP the point you made about them and you being sick. He can deal with it and he\u2019ll survive. NTA!!!", "NTA.\n\nI've been in his position - it can be tough. That's what I signed up for when I had kids, and making sure my partner wasn't saddled with the whole burden is what I'd signed up for when I found a partner.\n\nYou checked before buying the tickets, he was ok with it then, that's on him.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner's anxiety is normal though. He's anticipating handling something by himself he hasn't done before.\n\nSo be kind but also follow through with your plans. Encourage him, tell him he's got this, help with some contingency planning if things don't go as expected. AND then be sure to send him out some evening to do something with his friends so he can have a little social time too.\n\nThe anxiety will decrease the more you guys practice letting the other one have some time out of the house.", "Nta . But after you night out I think you should talk. Cause \n1/ ok it\u2019s stressful but would you be THAT anxious in the same situation? It seems no, so maybe he is a bit overreacting? \n2/ you give him the opportunities to tell you if he was ok and decide to say nothing and then start to be unfair.\n3/ he said he declined this kind of event, maybe he can give exemples. Was it recently ? Cause yes. You just had a baby so it\u2019s normal he stay with you. before ? Why didn\u2019t he tell you.", "NTA. He can suck it up for __one night__.", "**NTA** your husband is so wishy washy and passive aggressive with the way he's handling this. He just wants to make you feel guilty for going to the concert so he's saying all those things. He's also a parent and although i know it's hard to take care of kids, you were able to do so alone WHILE sick. Go the concert and have fun seriously.", "NTA. Your partner said it was fine _and you asked twice_. It's all on him. End of story. If you can't be straight and honest in your relationship, what's the point?", "NTA He will manage. It\u2019s only one night. It will do you the world of good to get out for the night.", "Nta if he doesn't want you to do something, you partner actually has to *communicate*.   You offered a solution, selling the ticket, and he refused.\n\nSounds like he just wants to be a martyr.   'Poor me, woe is me!  My wife left me all alone for one night to care for my own children!\" \n\nLet me go get the world's tiniest violin.", "NTA - he should have voiced his opinion in the multiple times you asked him.  You are being a very caring partner to even be as understanding to this - God forbid he has to take care of the children alone.  Also - if you go into a situation with nothing but a negative mindset, that is going to set the tone.\n\nI also have a feeling that even if the night goes well for him he is going to paint the picture that it was terrible - he sounds like the type.  Good luck and enjoy your concert!", "NTA\n\n1. He will be fine. \n2. He could have spoken up on numerous occasions and chose not to.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable to expect that both of you will occasionally be able to get a nigh free. It sounds like you asked him several times beforehand, and he had the opportunity multiple times to say no. Although it's hard to put two small children to bed, that is part of parenting that everyone has to learn to be able to do solo. What if a medical emergency happened and you were in the hospital or something?\n\nAs long as you would be willing to do the same for him, so that he could have a night to himself, I don't see that you did anything wrong here.", "NTA, you communicated. Your spouse did not.

Best case, your SO does fine and it\u2019ll help their confidence. \n\nEnjoy your evening guilt free", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou asked him before you bought the tickets on more than one occasion. I know he is now anxious, but he would have to do this at sometime. \n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t return to work for 4 months, I was the Secretary for a Residents Association and still had to take the minutes every other month. I was lucky in that I actually went into labour at a meeting, so it was 2 months before the next and my husband had to look after the children (nearly 4yo and a 2 month old) for 3 hours that evening (7:30pm start). He coped.", "NTA. He had so many opportunities to speak up about his stress. He will survive.

You both need time for yourselves. Make sure he gets a night out too.", "NTA\nEnjoy your time with your friends. Your partner thinks that you can handle both kids while sick, so he can handle them once while healthy.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSleep regression can happen out of nowhere. You asked him several times and he okay-ed you to go. He's just mad now because he feels it's not going to be easy. Guess what?? Having a poor attitude will guarantee that outcome.

What about all the times you handle the kids on your own??.\n\nGo to your concert. Have a good time. Don't answer phone calls. Minimum text messages. Don't hurry home. You're entitled to have a social life and time away from your kids.", "NTA. You asked (multiple times even!) and he said he was fine. There was open communication.

He is perfectly capable of doing bedtime, even with issues. Go and enjoy yourself", "NTA.\n\nYou gave him plenty of time to tell you he needed you at home before you bought the ticket, and he didnt. Now he is guilt tipping you about how hard it will be right before its happening, but also tell you to go, but gives you a dig about knowing how hard it will be? Holding over your head that he (supposedly) hasnt done things he wanted to do to be nice to you? Thats mean. He is being mean.\n\nHe set you up for failure as soon as he refused to communicate his feelings untill you had the tickets.", "NTA\n\nIf he can\u2019t handle the kids alone for **one single night** then he shouldn\u2019t have became a parent. He\u2019s allowed to be anxious about it, sure. But he\u2019s acting like you\u2019re leaving for weeks. You just took care of both kids all day for 4 days by yourself while sick. \n\nAlso, if you have an infant and toddler, in the last 3 years you\u2019ve been pregnant for 18 months, aka half of that time.

I don't think it's wrong for either of you to get night out, just unfortunate you can't take the night off together.

Sometimes the new parent anxiety paints everything with a worst-possible-scenario brush.\n\nI'm willing to bet that when push comes to shove the night will have some hiccups but will over all go smoothly enough and he will feel better about his abilities to care for your kids during bedtime (even by himself) after it's done. If this really is the very first time either of you has pulled a one parent bedtime than I think it's understandable for him to be a little scared, even if he really should be able to talk himself through that experience in a more adult way, or at least express his fears to you in a more measured fashion. Either way, my bet is all ends fine, and his confidence is boosted at the end, which gives you a really good opportunity to come home and say \"I love how beautifully you handled the night, and I'm so grateful I got to have this evening. I know I've been feeling nervous too about my first bedtime alone with the kids, but between my last few days home with them while we were sick, and seeing how great you did with them tonight, I know we're both rocking this parenting thing.\"", "NTA.

It's tough for everyone but we all do have to suck it up and just get on with it. This is being a parent. Both of you need to be able to take a night off and know that the other is capable enough to handle it. You're lucky, beyond his griping it seems he's well capable of actually doing it. Just encourage that. Tell him he's an awesome dad who's got this, he can totally do it.

Are you partners or is he used to making all the decisions? \n\nHowever, he is upset about putting two small children to bed on own.

Remind him he doesn't have to do things the way they normally get done or perfectly. As long as everyone is alive at the end of the evening it's a success.

The two of you are partners, and your family is a shared responsibility, and you both have to work together AND find time to be adults out in the world. You should each get some time to yourselves, time with just each other, and time as a family.

GiViNg pReCoGnItIoN\n\n/s", "Eh I do think moms have a bit more of a natural connection to kids since they grew them for nine months. That being said It shouldn't effect work load/responsibility.", "They have a 2.5 year old kid, so having never done a solo bedtime raises some side questions I would have. But at the end of the day, OP gave him a heads up, and he said nothing three times. Using solo bed time as an excuse is weak sauce, in my mind. As with almost everything kid related, you gotta figure it out. Let OP have their night instead of whining.", "He's an adult, he can communicate his anxiety without acting like a sulky teen.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\n\nThat or another seemingly common approach is possible \u2014 call his own mother for help.", "Yep. I'm guessing he magically won't know where anything is in the house while she's at the concert. I hope she ignores him.", "[removed]", "No, they share every night", "Thank you, that's reassuring. It's hard to understand also if you don't have small children. We just need to communicate better in the future and get through the chaotic babyhood/toddler time of life.", "Did you hear it though? They are a team couple, not a \"I have less freedom than you so I get to go out\" couple. They should approach this like a team (with empathy for his anxiety about the evening) such that they can progress to a place where they both feel comfortable having solo time.", ">This is the chance to build a blanket fort or have breakfast for dinner\n\nAW, this is the stuff that I miss the most from when my kids were little :(\n\nNow they're tweens/teens and way too cool for that (and Mom) \\*sob\\*", "Why should the father of the children need help putting them to bed? One child is two months-feed/change/diaper them and they are good to go. He just has to wrangle the toddler into bed.", ">45 min. ago\n\nThe uterus actually is a MAGICAL organ.", "Pretty sure they mean solo since they\u2019ve had 2 children, especially since neither have done it, not just the husband. It\u2019d be weird for neither one of them to have ever done solo bedtime at all. And \n\nOther than that, I agree, he had plenty of opportunity to object and doing so after the tickets are bought and with the excuse he used, lame.", "She probably means solo with both!", "Exactly!  As a parent, pity parties are totally a bad look.", "Or he can, as I\u2019m sure they tell their toddler, use his words to say how he actually feels.", "Apparently he couldn't (at least didn't). I answered your why, I think she should go out.", "Going from one to two is a very difficult transition for everyone in the house (except the new sibling LOL, they just do their own thing) so if your husband is usually really good about sharing parenting duties then I would chalk this up to nerves about handling both kids on his own.\n\nYou will both get more used to things and in a few years you'll be so used to it that you won't even remember what it was like to only have to watch one child :D\n\nAlso, 2.5 years is exactly how far apart my two are, and I very clearly remember the sleep and potty training regression that hit my oldest when we brought her little sister home. It was a rough few months, but I promise that it gets better and you become a battle hardened veteran parent of two that doesn't blink an eye at anything less than blood LOL.\n\nGood luck, and enjoy your new family of four OP!", "Because two months olds are necessarily easy to put to bed? We don\u2019t know how the baby acts or what they have, and she said neither of them have been solo for bed time in her edit.", "The whole human body is.", "Well, solo with both in 2 months, you've got to start Some time. He had time to object. He didn't. So guess he's starting now! Easy NTA.", "Even if that is the case, someone has to do it first. Why not the father?"]}
