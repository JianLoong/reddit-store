AITA for bailing on my best friend when she scheduled her surgery on my birthday & wouldn't reschedule after I asked her to?", "selftext": "So me (38 F) and my BFF (39 F) have been friends for 26 years. We have had similar medical issues through out our lives and I suggested a surgical procedure I had done & her doctor agreed that it would benefit her, too. So she gets scheduled & told me it was scheduled for my birthday. I was shocked but kept my cool & I politely asked her to reschedule for another day. This was told to me on July 17th, 2023. My birthday is October 16th. There was more than enough time to make arrangements for another day. She said she needs me to take care of her after surgery but I have annual birthday plans with my family who are coming into town, specifically for my birthday. I personally think it's rude & I find it selfish (I know I sound selfish but I would never schedule surgery on HER birthday)  because in March 2023, she scheduled her ablation surgery on my mother's birthday, which was & still is an emotional day for me as she [my mom] has been gone for 17 years. I want to be there for my friend but I don't think I should have to put my birthday on hold either. I get 1 day a year where I get to go out & enjoy my friends & family all together with me. She never comes to my annual parties anyway due to her addiction recovery & triggers (alcohol) & I respect that & we always do something else- aside from my annual get-together. My parents are flying in Sunday night & leaving Tuesday morning. They have an entire itinerary planned for the day & I told them about her surgery & they too, said to ask her to reschedule. It's not major surgery, it's not life or death, it's a common female procedure, that can be pushed back a week. I have no issue helping her during her 6-8 recovery period, but why didn't she reschedule? Why is she like this? So AITA for not being there on her day of surgery?", "created_utc": 1696678619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1724a85/aita_aita_for_bailing_on_my_best_friend_when_she/", "score": 1913, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like an asshole because I know her personal situation is rough & she doesn't have a lot of dependable people around. Her mom is sick with 2 types of cancer & is bed ridden from the pain. Her stepdad is never home & if he is, he's in the basement. Her children have mental health disorders on top of being spoiled so she has a full plate daily. But her eldest daughter is 15 & I feel like there's no excuse for her daughter not being able to help out.

You can take over after your celebrations. Sometimes I think friends do this out of spite to see how far they can go to find out what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for them.

Which is totally fair- if you want my help, you need to schedule it around my availability, and I am not available on or around my birthday. \n\nIf she wants to keep the surgery scheduled on that day, she needs to find someone else to help. Just tell her that- I'm sorry but I have family in town, we have plans, and I can't move that.

Do you think she gets some kind of weird kick out of making you reschedule your life around her issues?  You say she scheduled her last surgery on your mother\u2019s birthday, when she apparently knows how hard that day is for you. \n\nThe big question here is, why do you put up with it?  Scheduled surgeries are sometimes at the whim of the hospital, so maybe she can\u2019t help when the date is, but where in the friendship handbook does it say that ONLY YOU have to be on hand to help with her recovery?  She can get a visiting nurse, or she can reschedule the surgery, but you are her friend, NOT HER LACKEY!\n\nHonestly, this whole scenario sounds weirdly codependent.", "NTA. I really think at least half of these people didn\u2019t read the post, but some of it is how you wrote it. The short story is you already have plans with other people on the day of the surgery, which happens to be your birthday. Plane tickets have been purchased. Given the surgery was scheduled 3 months out it wasn\u2019t an emergency and another week or two would likely be fine for your friend. The only thing to tell her was your plans won\u2019t be changed so she either needs to find someone else to take care of her or reschedule the surgery.", "NTA. Your friend knew that you have family coming to town for your birthday. Yet she is demanding that you ditch your already known & set plans to help her on your birthday. She is just going to find somebody else to take care of her since you will be unavailable. Or else see if she can change the date of her surgery so that you can be there to help her. Honestly, your friend sounds a little selfish. Especially since this isn't the only time she has done something like this.", "NTA. Tell her either she reschedules or you just won\u2019t be taking care of her since you have yearly plans. Every year. For you and your family.

Feelings will be hurt, because you're expecting a lot from each other with one giving a little in return. \nI'm going to say NTA because of the friends addiction recovery and decency issues, but you need to really look at the relationship.", "NTA.  It sounds like she always tries to upstage important events for you and make them about herself.  What's going on there?  \n\nIn any event, it's not life or death surgery and it doesn't sound (based on what you've written) that it can't reasonably have the date moved.  I would tell your friend you'd be happy to be there for her, but you won't be able to on your birthday since it's your birthday and you have friends and family coming to celebrate.\n\nAnd then ignore her when she says you're not trying to be a good friend.  Not only did you suggest a surgery which will benefit her, but you also agreed to be there for her on a date that's more mutually convenient.", "NTA - it\u2019s elective surgery that could be rescheduled to fit the needs of the person she wants to have take care of her, but she\u2019s refused. \n\nI very nearly went with E S H, though, because it does sound like she may want to spend your actual birthday with you, as she, your \u201cBFF,\u201d is continually left out of your big plans due to her needs. What kind of friends want celebrations that will explicitly exclude the supposedly most important people in their lives? \n\nThere\u2019s also the point that, if you can celebrate your birthday on a different day with her, maybe you could celebrate on a different day with your family for once, especially as you\u2019re an adult and should understand that the world doesn\u2019t actually revolve around you \u201con your special day.\u201d \n\nBut, ultimately, it\u2019s elective and she\u2019s forcing you to choose between bailing on her or bailing on your family and friends and that makes her the bigger AH.", "NTA. tell her you will not be available to help at all, the entire time family is in town. Friend has to make other arrangements.", "INFO: did she intentionally schedule procedures on important days for you or were they just the dates she was given by the doctors??", "NTA. but why even ask her to reschedule \n1.  Just tell her you can\u2019t help that day. You have annual long standing plans that day.  Asking her to reschedule, when you should just say no to helping that day, is almost as ridiculous as her asking you to help her on your birthday.  \n\n2. What is most important here is relative.  For you it\u2019s your birthday, this is valid.  Please don\u2019t miss your birthday for someone, who knew they were gonna make you miss your birthday. For her, this surgery may be way more of a priority than your birthday.  Valid also if she doesn\u2019t want to reschedule than she has to find someone else to help that day.", "I think this is more of just setting reasonable expectations with your peer groups. You can say, \u201cI am unavailable on that day. It\u2019s my birthday and I already have commitments I cannot break.\u201d And then she says, \u201cOkay, I will shift the surgery date. What works for you?\u201d OR \u201cNo problem, I will make arrangements with my other friend.\u201d\n\nThese are examples of reasonable expectations. But they have to be set first. Asking her to change the date is out of line. Her refusing to change the date, and expecting you to give up your plans would be out of line. There is nothing wrong with you telling her you can\u2019t and seeing what follows.", "NTA. She intentionally and selfishly planned the surgery during this period.  You have been friends for 26 years, and this is an annual event.  No way in Hell she didn't realize what she was doing.", "NTA. You are not obligated to look after her. You are doing it because you love her and care what happens to her. If she reciprocated those feelings, she would have considered that your family being in town and spending time with them, as important to you. Just tell her that if she insists on having surgery on that date, regretfully, you will be unavailable to support her in the immediate aftermath. She will have to make alternative care arrangements.", "NTA. An actual friend wouldn\u2019t schedule on your birthday and then ask you to give up your day to help her.

These are days she knows you'll be busy with family, yet she schedules them anyway without asking first!\n\nMaybe she had no choice on dates?  But that seems odd to me. I know it can be different in other areas, but Hubby has had dozens of procedures, appointments, and a few surgeries the last 3 years, and each time they say \"We have x date and time open - does that work for you?\" And when it doesn't, they ask about another date and time. They've never demanded something happens on a certain day.", "NTA, but your friend is for scheduling on your birthday and expecting you to provide after care.\n\nAre you sure your history with her isn\u2019t riddled of instances where she exploited you?", "NTA\n\nNot your job to take care of her", "NTA.  This was scheduled back in July?  She needs to find someone else to care for her for a few days.

If it was just you two then you would be a jerk, but since it isn\u2019t she\u2019s being very selfish.

But as far as not rescheduling, if they're in the US, even if she tried in July, she would have had a good probability of not getting in until next year. Both need to stop expecting the other to drop their things.", "Oh of course. I definitely wasn't meaning to be against loving your birthday. But to expect people to drop things for it doesn't make sense to me. And again, I think friend should accept that it is important to OP and not depend on her.", "Happy belated birthday \ud83e\udd73", "Judging from the way this sub responds to birthdays, parties, and weddings, I have to assume these people have no friends. And if they do have friends, they don't actually like them.", "Yeah like I don\u2019t care about my birthday that much, but to act like anyone else who does is somehow entitled and crazy is ridiculous too. \n\nMaybe they\u2019re too used to entitled/AITA posts where the crazy friend/spouse has nuts birthday expectations or something but obviously doesn\u2019t apply here at all.", "What picking? Medical procedure dates are usually just assigned.", "That doesn\u2019t have any impact on OPs decisions", "So what's your point? Are you paying for the plane tickets?", "They *both* need to grow up and are too dependent on each other, so they're both AH. The entire world doesn't revolve around either of them..", "For the part of the mom's birthday, they've been friends for 26 years. A supposed best friend would know. Presumably she even knew OP's mom and was there when she died. I know mine was.\n\nAs for the scheduling, she says she asked about rescheduling when her friend told her, back in July. \n\nYes, it's true that rescheduling healthcare can be hard. I work in healthcare. I know. But the friend could have tried. I would have specifically asked if there was anything else available when first scheduling, as I know my friend's birthdate. If there wasn't, I would explain that to my friend when telling her about it.\n\nAnd for time for OP to reschedule her birthday plans, yes. But there was also time for friend to schedule someone else to caregive, at least for the first day, while OP was busy. As both already knew friend wouldn't go to the party anyway, surgery or no, I could see the friend going ahead with the surgery on the birthday, but I don't think it's OK she expects OP to care for her and cancel her plans. That should be up to OP, and as it isn't a life-threatening surgery, I don't think she's rude not to.", "I got mine in 2022 and that was how mine went too. It was a phone call saying be here at this date in a couple months. I didn't even get a time, they told me they'd call me the day before and let me know what time I'd need to be there at", "Yes it is. Any surgery that can be scheduled months in advance is elective. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important or won\u2019t massively improve your life; it just means that you won\u2019t immediately die if you don\u2019t have it right now. Which is what elective means in a medical context.", "That's you.  My surgery, and all the appointments leading up to it, I was given a date, not offered a choice.", "I've had over a dozen procedures as an adult in three states and have never been given the option to choose the date.", "The friend is the petty one when OP is upset that she had a surgery scheduled on OP's mom's birthday 17 years after she passed away? I don't get how any of each person's issues in this scenario affects the other one, honestly.", "But OP would be with her family. A group of people. I\u2019d ask my friend if we could do something either earlier in the day together or a day before or after if I felt that uncomfortable around alcohol. If it were only going to be the OP drinking then yes, that would be a jerk move for sure.", "No, the *text* reads that, which is just one reason of several why the friend is an AH, but the tone has 'my birthday is as important as a holiday' vibes.", "And I said the friend sucks for that expectation. I don\u2019t begrudge OP for saying no to that expectation.", "Except that I did. It\u2019s not my problem if you can\u2019t comprehend it. \n\nAnd being elective doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not needed. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not difficult to schedule. The fact that it\u2019s elective isn\u2019t relevant.", "OP should not have asked her to reschedule, just said she won\u2019t be available on that day.", "Don't you know? Everyone on the Internet is a man because male is the default gender!", "I waited over a year for a tonsillectomy and it ended up on my brother's birthday. My hysterectomy and excision surgery was am 18 month long ordeal. I was called 10 days before as the surgeon finally had spots open and my need was great due to crippling daily pain- it was on my wedding anniversary.\n\nSometimes you just need to say yes to the date when it's really needed.", "Surgeries are also 6 months out where I live too and it took me 1.5 years to get in with a specialist for another condition I have.", "I was told it would 6-9 months to get my gallbladder removed.  The only reason I managed to get in early (3 months), was because of a last minute cancellation.  \n\nWhen you get a date for surgery, don\u2019t give it up.  If you cancel, you will be waiting.", "Where I live, they pretty much offer you one time and you can take it or you can go to the back of the list and wait another year. You are expected to move whatever is necessary.", "Same. My surgery was scheduled six months out. Even a colonoscopy was scheduled 4-6 months out.", "But OP mentioned that they told them this in July when the surgery was booked for October, so it was at the time of booking and months in advance. I think it\u2019s fair and would have given the friend enough time to rebook for a date in the same range.", "I work for a doctor, previously worked tor a surgeon. She had the date back in March. They very likely had the week after still being booked at that time and if she asked it could have been accommodated easily. Trying to switch now will obviously have a huge delay but if she thought about it back then it would have been no issue.", "But OP asked them to reschedule back in July when it was first booked. Sure it would be almost impossible to re-book for another October day *now* but back then they probably could have moved it by a week or a few weeks without too much problem.", "Where are you getting that? OP doesn't expect everyone to celebrate only them. They have people coming in to celebrate with her and plans. People do that all the time. And she was never expecting her friend to celebrate with them, either. She explicitly says that, due to the friend's issues. So she's not expecting people to only celebrate her.\n\nShe's frustrated because her friend is expecting her to not do the birthday plans she has scheduled in order to care for her because of the surgery.", "It\u2019s not so much the birthday celebration, it\u2019s that the friend is mad OP isn\u2019t available to help due to plans in place before the surgery was scheduled  (including family visiting from out of town).", "It\u2019s elective surgery, so you can definitely pick a date.", "Yeah, the OP had made plans well in advance of her friend's surgery. It doesn't matter what.\n\nThe fact that it's the OP's birthday and she makes a big deal out of it means that the friend could've anticipated that the OP wouldn't be free.", "If I were the friend, sure. Why would I pay for anything now? That doesn't make sense.", "How is OP dependent on her best friend?  Because she won't cancel prior made plans to care for friend?  Literally all she did was ask her friend to reschedule if she wanted OP to take care of her.", "It was up to each side to cancel their plans for the other. The door swings both ways.", "We both know I\u2019m using elective in the context of medically unnecessary surgery.", "This. I got wiggle room but ultimately, I could not choose the date. And if I did, I would have to wait longer. It was basically when my surgeon was available.", "I feel like that is far stranger than the alternative. How would they possibly know if you have other appointments that day? And many people have multiple medical appointments they have to arrange. And for reference, my family has scheduled 6 different surgical procedures this year, every one was scheduled. Have you ever asked to reschedule?", "Did you ever ask? I was given alternate dates for 2 of 3 surgeries I've had in the last 6 years and the 1 I wasn't given options for was an emergency where they fit me into the schedule ASAP", "I have never *not* been given an option when scheduled reasonably ahead of time. Sounds like you need to speak up.", "I was referring to OP\u2019s birthday, which is the bigger, more in depth part of the post. Maybe go read the post?", "1) who gives a a crap about most holidays?\n2) the post is pointing out OP does the same thing every year, and it's reasonable that someone would know that their good friend does the same thing every year. Thus the annoyance. It would be far more understandable for someone to not realize that OP just randomly has guests in town one weekend, but OP annually has guests in town. That's not about being precious, it's about the history and expectation.", "OP asked her to reschedule so that OP can take care of her friend after surgery. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s saying reschedule because it\u2019s my precious birthday, it\u2019s so they can both get what they need. \n\nI don\u2019t get how OP sucks for trying to come up with a compromise that works for both of them.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "It Is relevant if her friend expects OP to take care of her.

That\u2019s not acceptable behavior in my book.\n\nThis is under no circumstance what one would call a \"valid reason\" otherwise you could use that for literally anything \"well in my book its not acceptable behavior for a doctor to help someone with different religious beliefs\" like its just a cop out to justify stupid or dumb positions.", "My brother tore his Achilles tendon and needed surgery to repair it. He hobbled around on crutches for a couple of weeks only to get a call on a Friday that they could get him in that next Monday and if he couldn\u2019t take that day it then they wouldn\u2019t know when the next available surgery date would be, especially since the surgeon had already moved things to fit him in. He had to drop everything to get the surgery done and my mom had to drop everything she had to drive the 8 hours to take care of him after surgery because he didn\u2019t have anyone else who could. My sister and I were also on pause to fly in to help him in case his recovery took longer than our mom could stay with him.", "Yeah exactly. Even if she had tried then, there would be no guarantee she could even get in before the end of the year.", "Right exactly. People go on and on about not wanting any socialized medical care because of the wait time, but I know someone here that literally waited 6 months for a NEEDED surgery, with good insurance. \n\nObviously I'm in the US. \ud83e\udd85", "Same. US?", "Yeah, my wisdom teeth got scheduled months in advance the week of my birthday. So I felt like crude on my birthday. Had we waited, it would have been months more. The risk of infection was high, so I just went for it.", "To see my new endocrinologist was 6 months out also after Covid! So I get why she may not want to reschedule.", "Not necessarily. OP's friend is probably not the only person waiting on surgery, and here at least you are called with a date and time and that's the date and time you show up. You don't get to say \"actually Wednesday would work better for me\" because somebody else is probably getting surgery on Wednesday.", "You don't get to negotiate surgery dates, they tell you when and where and you show up. Other plans change around surgery, not the other way around.", "Nah, there is no guarantee that she could have even got in this year in the US. It sounds hyperbolic, but it isn't.", "Not in my experience, unless I had been able to call in less than 24 hours, and even then, no guarantee.", "Maybe, but I think it's a completely unreasonable ask to say \"can you move a medical appointment for yourself because it's my birthday.\" OP comes across extremely childish and petty for wanting someone to move a medical procedure for the sake of a day that can be celebrated whenever OP pleases.", "Read the explanation of why OP thinks she might be the asshole. It really sounds like the friend has no one else.", "Not around me. The demand is so high that you get the date and time you get. If you want to reschedule you\u2019ll be waiting for close to a year.", "She's dependent on her best friend because the best friend seems to be the only person that is consistently there for OP if OP really feels that her birthday is the \"only day of the year\" that her family and friends will go out with her and do what she wants. I also don't understand how OP says this is the only day she's unavailable but then states she was unavailable for her mother's birthday and presumably her mother's death date and what about her family members and friends birthdays like this isn't the only day and OP is just being a spoiled brat.", "But that is not what your first comment was implying. You said it's hard to reschedule surgery and dissed having dates that weren't emotionally good just because the mom has been dead 17 years. I responded to that statement in particular, because that is a bad take. While this last statement says it's on both of them, your other comments were implying OP was TA for not canceling her plans. And I argue that's not fair. If it's on both, it's on both. Then either everyone sucks here or no one does, and it's not that OP is in the wrong specifically.\n\nWhy can't they both go ahead with their respective plans and friend find someone else to help for the one day OP is not available?", "They're proposing the first available date. If you're not available on that date, you will need to pick a later date that's available. OP clarifies in their post that this isn't an urgent procedure and could have easily been scheduled out a week or more.", "If I had said no to that date, they would have offered me one nine months later.  If you need the surgery, you reschedule the other stuff.", "I\u2019ve never had them give me a choice of dates. It\u2019s always \u201cthis is when it will be\u201d and I\u2019m expected to move other appointments and make it work.

I'm a single mum, so have to arrange childcare while I'm healing coordinating with my dad (who is 73 years old) around his medical stuff. My last surgery was scheduled a month before hand and for coverage at work i asked if we could do it a week earlier (so the teens could cover my shifts they'd be at school ) or a week later so i had enough time to train my coworker on my specific shift and they literally laughed because we don't even get the time were supposed to show up till 24 hours before the surgery date they give you.

Maybe it's regional.", "Sorry to ask but where do you live to have wisdom teeth removal scheduled months in advance? It sound just weird to me as I have same day removal and it just how it is to most people here.", "Why is OP responsible ? \nMissed the part where OP is the caretaker of life partner. They are friends. Friend of OP needs to extend her support circle.\nIt also seems to be an elective surgery.", "It can\u2019t be celebrated whenever OP pleases family members are flying in to be with them that day already planned, $$ already spent on tickets, etc. OP told friend this in July, friend didn\u2019t reschedule or get someone else, not OPS fault or OP being a snowflake. That\u2019s OP living their life.", "So why don't you drop everything and fly into wherever she is and help her friend out for those days? \n\nOP isn't obligated to help her friend at all. Yes it's a nice thing to do, but OP had plans and obligations that day. She made it clear to her friend, at the first opportunity, that she did. It's okay for her friend to ask, but OP outright told her those days didn't work for her.\n\nIt also really sounds like OP's friend puts a lot on her. OP deserves to have time to herself. She deserves to be able to make plans without having to drop everything the moment her friend needs her. She deserves to have time for her own self care. \n\nOP's friend lacks a support group. OP's friend has kids that are spoiled, with mental health issues, and a teen that is unable to handle things for a day or two while their mother is recovering from surgery. There are lots of red flags there.", "Well, not everyone is where you are. Again, it\u2019s elective surgery, it\u2019s not essential.

And spoiled brat? What? Are you the friend OP is talking about? You're all over this posting talking about how bad OP is and throwing in a bunch of things that aren't in the post. Who hurt you? This clearly hit some kind of raw nerve.", "It\u2019s not a life saving, urgent medical procedure. That\u2019s different", "Why are you getting downvotes? I cannot imagine asking anyone to reschedule a medial procedure for any reason and idk anyone who would think that was ok to do\n\nETA I think ESH, the friend is being unreasonable also and needs to figure out someone else who can be with her that day, but idk where y\u2019all are from that you can just schedule major surgeries for a week later, you get the dates you get and depending on the surgery next one could be in months away.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "Then I'm glad you've come to the understanding that only OP's friend is TA for expecting her to drop everything. Good talk", "I really think it depends on the medical system in your area. Where I am, it's pretty common to get surgery scheduled in under a month and often within a week or two. My husband needs back surgery and that would have been scheduled within a week of meeting with the surgeon. We had a 5 week wait to get in with him, though. Unfortunately, my husband had emergency surgery last week (unrelated to his back) and needs a second surgery, so now it will be many months before he can have the back surgery, but that's due to other issues and not availability.", "Did you read her explanation of why she might be the asshole? Her friend basically has no one else to care for her besides her 15 yo daughter. Honestly, I hope the friend can even get the surgery because you need an adult to take you, pick you up, and stay overnight with you.", "She literally said in her post that friend scheduled her ablation surgery on her mother's birthday which OP says is hard for her.

And in many places you don\u2019t get that many options for when surgery is.", "Ummm if you're expecting someone to care for you after a medical procedure you have to plan around their schedule. You cant expect people to drop things that have been planned in advance just so you can be taken care of...", "IMO if someone is insistent on *you* being the one to take care of them and knew you had family coming in town but agreed to that date and still insisted on you caring for them...

OP essentially said \"well im busy at that so **if** you want **me** to look after you during recovery, you will have to reschedule.", "Oh, aren\u2019t you cute. I said ESH and I stand by that. I never changed that. Stop twisting things to suit your narrative.", "None of those things have to do with OP ?

So you do what you can. OP can\u2019t, and offered options. \n\nJust because the friends circumstances are that way, OP bears no responsibility? It\u2019s sucks for the friend but, there are completely solo people who exist , and have had surgery. \n\nYou can go help if you feel so bad for OPs friend, you sound very kind and understanding. \nBut also they have volunteers and stuff for that too fyi. \n But also friend can reschedule if it has to be OP", "No, you added all of this -\n\n>presumably her mother's death date and what about her family members and friends birthdays like this isn't the only day\n\nNone of that was in the post. Only her comment about her mom's birthday was ever said. You made things up to further bash OP.", "Then if that\u2019s the case, best friend doesn\u2019t get to ruin OPs bday.
