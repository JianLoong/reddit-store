AITA for bailing on my best friend when she scheduled her surgery on my birthday & wouldn't reschedule after I asked her to?", "selftext": "So me (38 F) and my BFF (39 F) have been friends for 26 years. We have had similar medical issues through out our lives and I suggested a surgical procedure I had done & her doctor agreed that it would benefit her, too. So she gets scheduled & told me it was scheduled for my birthday. I was shocked but kept my cool & I politely asked her to reschedule for another day. This was told to me on July 17th, 2023. My birthday is October 16th. There was more than enough time to make arrangements for another day. She said she needs me to take care of her after surgery but I have annual birthday plans with my family who are coming into town, specifically for my birthday. I personally think it's rude & I find it selfish (I know I sound selfish but I would never schedule surgery on HER birthday)  because in March 2023, she scheduled her ablation surgery on my mother's birthday, which was & still is an emotional day for me as she [my mom] has been gone for 17 years. I want to be there for my friend but I don't think I should have to put my birthday on hold either. I get 1 day a year where I get to go out & enjoy my friends & family all together with me. She never comes to my annual parties anyway due to her addiction recovery & triggers (alcohol) & I respect that & we always do something else- aside from my annual get-together. My parents are flying in Sunday night & leaving Tuesday morning. They have an entire itinerary planned for the day & I told them about her surgery & they too, said to ask her to reschedule. It's not major surgery, it's not life or death, it's a common female procedure, that can be pushed back a week. I have no issue helping her during her 6-8 recovery period, but why didn't she reschedule? Why is she like this? So AITA for not being there on her day of surgery?", "created_utc": 1696678619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1724a85/aita_aita_for_bailing_on_my_best_friend_when_she/", "score": 4812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like an asshole because I know her personal situation is rough & she doesn't have a lot of dependable people around. Her mom is sick with 2 types of cancer & is bed ridden from the pain. Her stepdad is never home & if he is, he's in the basement. Her children have mental health disorders on top of being spoiled so she has a full plate daily. But her eldest daughter is 15 & I feel like there's no excuse for her daughter not being able to help out. I can be there every day after the 16th, just not on the 16th.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can take over after your celebrations. Sometimes I think friends do this out of spite to see how far they can go to find out what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for them. Rethink that friendship.", "You have your plans all set with your family, and she had plenty of time to reschedule.  You are NTA and she has to find someone else to help her for the first few days.  It sounds like she might prioritize her own needs over yours, you may want to think if this is a pattern of hers?", "NTA. \n\nI'm assuming the reason you asked her to reschedule was because she expects you to help her during/after the surgery. Which is totally fair- if you want my help, you need to schedule it around my availability, and I am not available on or around my birthday. \n\nIf she wants to keep the surgery scheduled on that day, she needs to find someone else to help. Just tell her that- I'm sorry but I have family in town, we have plans, and I can't move that.

Do you think she gets some kind of weird kick out of making you reschedule your life around her issues?  You say she scheduled her last surgery on your mother\u2019s birthday, when she apparently knows how hard that day is for you. \n\nThe big question here is, why do you put up with it?  Scheduled surgeries are sometimes at the whim of the hospital, so maybe she can\u2019t help when the date is, but where in the friendship handbook does it say that ONLY YOU have to be on hand to help with her recovery?  She can get a visiting nurse, or she can reschedule the surgery, but you are her friend, NOT HER LACKEY!\n\nHonestly, this whole scenario sounds weirdly codependent.", "NTA. I really think at least half of these people didn\u2019t read the post, but some of it is how you wrote it. The short story is you already have plans with other people on the day of the surgery, which happens to be your birthday. Plane tickets have been purchased. Given the surgery was scheduled 3 months out it wasn\u2019t an emergency and another week or two would likely be fine for your friend. The only thing to tell her was your plans won\u2019t be changed so she either needs to find someone else to take care of her or reschedule the surgery.", "NTA. Your friend knew that you have family coming to town for your birthday. Yet she is demanding that you ditch your already known & set plans to help her on your birthday. She is just going to have to find somebody else to take care of her since you will be unavailable. Or else see if she can change the date of her surgery so that you can be there to help her. Honestly, your friend sounds a little selfish. Especially since this isn't the only time she has done something like this.", "NTA. Tell her either she reschedules or you just won\u2019t be taking care of her since you have yearly plans. Every year. For you and your family. She can\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t aware of said yearly plans.", "You're in a codependent relationship. Feelings will be hurt, because you're expecting a lot from each other with one giving a little in return. \nI'm going to say NTA because of the friends addiction recovery and decency issues, but you need to really look at the relationship.", "NTA.  It sounds like she always tries to upstage important events for you and make them about herself.  What's going on there?  \n\nIn any event, it's not life or death surgery and it doesn't sound (based on what you've written) that it can't reasonably have the date moved.  I would tell your friend you'd be happy to be there for her, but you won't be able to on your birthday since it's your birthday and you have friends and family coming to celebrate.\n\nAnd then ignore her when she says you're not trying to be a good friend.  Not only did you suggest a surgery which will benefit her, but you also agreed to be there for her on a date that's more mutually convenient.", "NTA - it\u2019s elective surgery that could be rescheduled to fit the needs of the person she wants to have take care of her, but she\u2019s refused. \n\nI very nearly went with E S H, though, because it does sound like she may want to spend your actual birthday with you, as she, your \u201cBFF,\u201d is continually left out of your big plans due to her needs. What kind of friends want celebrations that will explicitly exclude the supposedly most important people in their lives? \n\nThere\u2019s also the point that, if you can celebrate your birthday on a different day with her, maybe you could celebrate on a different day with your family for once, especially as you\u2019re an adult and should understand that the world doesn\u2019t actually revolve around you \u201con your special day.\u201d \n\nBut, ultimately, it\u2019s elective and she\u2019s forcing you to choose between bailing on her or bailing on your family and friends and that makes her the bigger AH.", "NTA. tell her you will not be available to help at all, the entire time family is in town. Friend has to make other arrangements.", "INFO: did she intentionally schedule procedures on important days for you or were they just the dates she was given by the doctors??", "NTA. but why even ask her to reschedule \n1.  Just tell her you can\u2019t help that day. You have annual long standing plans that day.  Asking her to reschedule, when you should just say no to helping that day, is almost as ridiculous as her asking you to help her on your birthday.  \n\n2. What is most important here is relative.  For you it\u2019s your birthday, this is valid.  Please don\u2019t miss your birthday for someone, who knew they were gonna make you miss your birthday. For her, this surgery may be way more of a priority than your birthday.  Valid also if she doesn\u2019t want to reschedule than she has to find someone else to help that day.", "I think this is more of just setting reasonable expectations with your peer groups. You can say, \u201cI am unavailable on that day. It\u2019s my birthday and I already have commitments I cannot break.\u201d And then she says, \u201cOkay, I will shift the surgery date. What works for you?\u201d OR \u201cNo problem, I will make arrangements with my other friend.\u201d\n\nThese are examples of reasonable expectations. But they have to be set first. Asking her to change the date is out of line. Her refusing to change the date, and expecting you to give up your plans would be out of line. There is nothing wrong with you telling her you can\u2019t and seeing what follows.", "NTA. She intentionally and selfishly planned the surgery during this period.  You have been friends for 26 years, and this is an annual event.  No way in Hell she didn't realize what she was doing.", "NTA. You are not obligated to look after her. You are doing it because you love her and care what happens to her. If she reciprocated those feelings, she would have considered that your family being in town and spending time with them, as important to you. Just tell her that if she insists on having surgery on that date, regretfully, you will be unavailable to support her in the immediate aftermath. She will have to make alternative care arrangements.", "NTA. An actual friend wouldn\u2019t schedule on your birthday and then ask you to give up your day to help her. I would NEVER do that and it just seems like she feels like she\u2019s entitled to you time and not thinking about anyone but herself. She made that appointment way in advance and could have chosen different.", "NTA\n\nShe is putting herself first. Do the same.", "Nta. Your friend didn\u2019t schedule 2 surgeries on important birthdays in your life (your own and your mother, sorry for your loss) on accident. BFFR.

There are missing elements here and some depth missing as well.", "NTA\n\nIt's not even about birthdays. These are days she knows you'll be busy with family, yet she schedules them anyway without asking first!\n\nMaybe she had no choice on dates?  But that seems odd to me. I know it can be different in other areas, but Hubby has had dozens of procedures, appointments, and a few surgeries the last 3 years, and each time they say \"We have x date and time open - does that work for you?\" And when it doesn't, they ask about another date and time. They've never demanded something happens on a certain day.", "NTA, but your friend is for scheduling on your birthday and expecting you to provide after care.\n\nAre you sure your history with her isn\u2019t riddled of instances where she exploited you?", "NTA\n\nNot your job to take care of her", "NTA.  This was scheduled back in July?  She needs to find someone else to care for her for a few days.  This isn\u2019t just about your birthday, it\u2019s about you having relatives flying in during that time.  If it was just you two then you would be a jerk, but since it isn\u2019t she\u2019s being very selfish.

Expecting you to drop your plans for her is her issue, not yours.", "NTA. to me, the issue here is that she expects you to care for her. if she's expecting you to commit to something, you get to renegotiate the terms before you actually commit to it. she's being unfair and you have no obligation to cancel your plans. given the current terms, decide what you're willing to offer as support to her recovery and then do that.", "NTA Your (not) friend appears to have narcissistic tendencies.

I work in healthcare. I know. But the friend could have tried. I would have specifically asked if there was anything else available when first scheduling, as I know my friend's birthdate. If there wasn't, I would explain that to my friend when telling her about it.\n\nAnd for time for OP to reschedule her birthday plans, yes. But there was also time for friend to schedule someone else to caregive, at least for the first day, while OP was busy. As both already knew friend wouldn't go to the party anyway, surgery or no, I could see the friend going ahead with the surgery on the birthday, but I don't think it's OK she expects OP to care for her and cancel her plans.

You said it's hard to reschedule surgery and dissed having dates that weren't emotionally good just because the mom has been dead 17 years. I responded to that statement in particular, because that is a bad take. While this last statement says it's on both of them, your other comments were implying OP was TA for not canceling her plans.

Unfortunately, my husband had emergency surgery last week (unrelated to his back) and needs a second surgery, so now it will be many months before he can have the back surgery, but that's due to other issues and not availability.", "Did you read her explanation of why she might be the asshole?
