Just go low contact, don't even let her inside because she'll find a reason to stay, even for a day and extended until you're back here complaining on how to get rid of her.  She raised you to be self-sufficient, which congratulations you and your bf are to have accomplished getting a house, so now it's her problem to do the same thing.  Again, PLEASE don't make her problem your problem!", "NTA. \n\nI can't think of anything worse for your relationship or mental well-being than that. Her brazen attitude that this is going to happen, shows that she has no consideration for you and definitely not your boyfriend. \n\nWe all know she had no intention of looking for a new place to live. She wanted to live with you, rent free, and act like she owned the place. \n\nThe only way you were going to get rid of her then is to sell the house, move, and leave no forwarding address. But then it would be full of smoke and roaches and you wouldn't get your money back.", "NTA. So without consulting you your mom gives notice to her landlord because she's decided she's moving in with you? And you are supposed to just agree to this because.....why?  You are not her retirement plan.  She's a grown up woman who made a stupid decision. It's not your job to bail her out.", "NTA. Don't let her move in!!!", "NTA\n\nIf she moves in, she\u02bbll never want to move out.\n\nDon\u02bbt even give her a key to your place.", "NTA\n\nDon't even agree to a one month stay... \n\nYou just have to hold that boundary and so does your boyfriend... no giving in when they do arrive, just call the cops like you said.\n\nIt sounds like there is a history there with you and your mom... your boyfriend may not get it but he needs to.\n\nNever let her in your house or you will never get her out.", " nope. don\u2019t allow it, you are not your mom\u2019s puppet.", "NTA. \n\nSmoker AND fleas?! Yuck!", "NTA. You will have to prise them out of your house with a crowbar.", "NTA- don't let either of these humans move in with you.", "NTA your mom and sister sound like they both would be moving in since you brought her up at the end but regardless your mom shouldn\u2019t have assumed and the fact you and your boyfriend just closed and you said she\u2019s a chain smoker and I\u2019m assuming she wouldn\u2019t smoke outside then she\u2019s just instantly going to destroy the value of your new home. Ontop of that they sound messy with fleas and roaches that\u2019s an instant hell no from me. Congrats on your home BTW", "NTA. Smokers. Jobless, roaches, fleas. Nope, absolutely not.  Stand firm. I am sure you would end up paying all the bills. They would not even look for jobs if they had a sucker to support them. \n\nMy mother is the sweetest person in the world and my husband himself invited her to live with us (She is a trained chef and lives to be useful. It would be like having a live in maid).

There is no other circumstance, only wishes that they were different people. They are who they are and they are not people you want 50ft near your new home. \n\nI would make it really clear to her if she shows up with her stuff, you\u2019re planning to have her trespassed by the police. Your home is 100% off limits.", "Yes, when she was telling me about how she give a notice, I thought about that and straight up asked her if her plan was to move into my house, and she said yes, that was her plan if she couldn\u2019t find a place to go within the 30 days", "I assume her plan was to throw a sob story - her way of getting what she wants, always", "That was my mothers plan if she didn't die before she ran out of savings for retirement.

Let her figure it out. You don\u2019t want roaches or fleas or smoke residue in your new home.", "I get the sense she may not have been planning try too hard to make other arrangements and was banking on staying with you. I don't know your mom, just sinking suspicion \n\nNTA and hold firm, if you let her in, it will likely be near impossible to get her put. Good luck!", "Dont give in because my bet is she wont leave.

If they do decide to show up at our house, they will be asked to leave, and if they refuse, the cops will be called.", "I mean, she\u2019s going to show up at your house with all her stuff, and she\u2019ll just stay there. Outside your house.\n What are you going to do then?\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Easy for your BF to say because he knows they won't change.  But guests don't leave in a month or so and they are hard to get rid of.  I am glad you have a plan to get rid of them, stick to it.", "She won\u2019t be allowed in the house, she\u2019ll be asked to leave and if she refuses I\u2019ll have to call the cops on her. I assume that my sister would come with her where ever she goes - sorry for the confusion", "Is there a way to keep her from knowing the address?"]}
