What your wife should have told her friend is that she never thought my husband was good enough, why would you expect him to lend you money? I'm sure she never admitted she was shallow and apologized for judging you for her superficial issues about you. This is a really big ask for someone who has treated you so poorly. NTA. The couple should apply for a loan or get another credit card to pay for her dreams. The problem with that for them is that they would have to pay that back. Did she gift you and your wife the equivalent of 3000$ for your wedding?", "NTA. Her wedding her money!!

Remove the info from your brain that you don\u2019t like this friend\u2026it has nothing to do with the audacity and entitlement for someone to ask a friend for 3k for a dream wedding they can\u2019t afford. Personally, anytime I see \u201cdream wedding,\u201d I automatically assume the wedding dreamer is the AH, but following my own advice and removing my personal prejudice from the equation, I realize you didn\u2019t say the bride asked for 3k\u2026.the bride asked for donations and your wife asked if y\u2019all could donate 3k, which is absurd. There may be a few AH here, none of which are you. Donate 300 in lieu of a gift and pat yourself on the back for a generous gift.", "Heck no!!! If she cannot afford something then be an adult and save like everyone else. Tell the friends to donate the money then. Even if you liked her this is still her issue.
