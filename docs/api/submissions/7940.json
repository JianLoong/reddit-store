I don't understand why the sister makes such a distinction between a valuable job (study, a lot of income) and an invaluable job (probably everything that falls under \"working class\"). i mean i could argue how much a society would perish without the parts of a society doing the hard work on the ground. here in germany the parts of the job that are valuable for the sister are called \"carpet floor\" and the workers at the base know that they only delegate and have no idea of \u200b\u200bthe actual physical work that society needs, but that is another discussion and helps op not. I would ask myself in which class society your sister lives. And why don't members of the family pay for the food, since they feel superior anyway. what coherent logic does the sister's argument follow, either people who earn less are worth less and for that reason alone you have to pay for the food. Another variant could be that you don't deserve to be put on the same level as us because it's not a high income job. in summary, both implications are disturbing and suggest that your sister is a classy asshole.", "By your sisters logic, she should be paying for her own meal.
