Regardless, I still took my wallet just in case. The dinner itself was wonderful and the restaurant was amazing, and everything was paid for by my dad. However, after dinner was over and we returned home, my sister (30F) pulled me aside and asked why I didn\u2019t pay for my own meal.\n\nConfused by this, I said to her that dad said he\u2019d pay for us all. She said that was just him being polite, and that my job was not as respectable as hers or my brothers new job (she works in a Law firm, I\u2019m a cook). \n\nI went and told my parents this and they said they\u2019re just happy we are working people and getting an income.

Some may argue it's more so than a lawyer depending on how you feel about both professions. Either way, she's wrong & overstepping due to her prejudice.

They're...not wrong). \n\nBut, to be fair, I was basing my assumption on the fact that sister was being a brat about OP not being 'good enough' and that's why she should pay...
