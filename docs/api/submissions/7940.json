The dinner was a special occasion for my brother\u2019s (23M) new job in IT which he has always dreamed of.\n\nMy dad said that seeing as it\u2019s a treat, he would pay for all of us. Regardless, I still took my wallet just in case. The dinner itself was wonderful and the restaurant was amazing, and everything was paid for by my dad. However, after dinner was over and we returned home, my sister (30F) pulled me aside and asked why I didn\u2019t pay for my own meal.\n\nConfused by this, I said to her that dad said he\u2019d pay for us all. She said that was just him being polite, and that my job was not as respectable as hers or my brothers new job (she works in a Law firm, I\u2019m a cook). \n\nI went and told my parents this and they said they\u2019re just happy we are working people and getting an income. However, my sister suddenly burst and said that my job is nearly not as important and because of that I had to pay for my own meal.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674341469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i42ww/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_food/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are the best and sister is a sour lemon, redundant but true.", "NTA. Your sister has some issues. Tell her to kick rocks.", "Nta. We're missing something. How does your sister think having a \"better\" job entitles her to a free meal?", "NTA \n\nIf I were a betting woman I would say something bigger is going on with your sister and she\u2019s projecting.", "Your sister is the AH you are NTA. What the hell is she even trying to say? If Dad is paying for the whole family's meal, what does anyone's job have to do with anything? Why does your occupation have anything to do with paying for your meal?? TBH if your siblings jobs are so much better, THEY should be paying for the meal. This is insane.", "Sounds like this isn\u2019t about who paid for dinner but rather about something your sister is dealing with. Bottom line is your sister doesn\u2019t get to decide on whom your dad spends his money. Only he decides that. Not sure what her issue is with your job but from the way I\u2019m reading this, your dad did pay for everyone\u2019s meal, including hers, right. But that\u2019s ok cause she has a good job?

Uh, I feel like your sister doesn't like you all that much", "NTA. WTF?! Ironic how your job is \u201cnot respectable\u201d as a COOK, but she doesn\u2019t pay for the food she ate, but you\u2019re expected to. If anything, a cook shouldn\u2019t have to pay for food they could\u2019ve made themselves.", "NTA. Your sister has some ugly opinions on who is deserving of good things and who is unworthy. She should examine why it's so important to her that a mere dishwasher pay for his own food when someone else offered.", "Wth?!?! Your sister's logic doesn't even make any sense. Why does she feel she needs to speak for your parents? You are so NTA, but your sister certainly is. Take your parents' word at face value and ignore her crazy comments.", "NTA. Your sister is being horrible and rude.", "NTA, your parents offered to pay and had no problem with it! Your sister needs to get over herself!", "`my sister suddenly burst and said that my job is nearly not as important and because of that I had to pay for my own meal.`  \nNTA, but your sister certainly is.  Since her job is so much more important and all, she can pay the bill.", "No, you are NTA\n\nYour sister though. She is a massive, massive AH. She thinks she\u2019s very important, but I bet she isn\u2019t as important as she thinks she is.

Because this is just insane to me.", "As I\u2019ve explained in some comments, my sister always had a competitive/arrogant mind since we were kids.

My brother also went through university but never talked about how hard he studied etc", "Huh? Damn I thought food was more important than legal work. Just my opinion. Your sister is an idiot", "Wow. Your sister is really weird. NTA.\n\nIf she paid for her own meal, she might be justified in saying you should have paid for yours, too.\n\nBut it sounds like she just wants your parents to treat you worse than your siblings.", "NTA -  Sorry but your sister sounds awful if this is her attitude. Why, in her mind, you should have to pay is completely beyond me", "NTA but it seems like your sister is. I don't understand how your different jobs would have an effect on you paying for the meal or not. Your dad offered to pay. Her opinion is irrelevant.", "NTA\n\nWhat's up her ass tf lmao", "NTA. Did she pay them behind your back? Did she offer to pay for dinner? She is absolutely TA", "NTA. Human work cannot be underestimated.", "NTA.  Even if there is more going on, like you parents borrowing money from your sister, she needs to discuss what with you quietly and in private", "Info, did your sister pay for her share?", "NTA- Your job and whether your parents are paying for a meal are irrelevant. I would ask her if she wants a cookie next time for having the \"more respectable job.\" Or then tell her to pay if her job is so wonderful.", "NTA. You are not required to pass up on a gift because you make less than your siblings.  Your sister is TA. If you are doing something you like and it pays the bills, it is none of her business what you do and not judge you.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is just trying to put you down. She sucks.", "NTA. Your sis needs to find a hobby rather than minding other people\u2019s business lol. I\u2019m sure your dad was happy to treat you.", "What on earth? NTA. Of course not. Sounds like your sister gets off on belittling others (or just you, idk). Her argument is riduclous, too. If her job is so much more respectable and important, why isn't SHE paying for you? or everyone else? What the fuck is that?!\n\ni'd put money on it that your sister is secretly really struggling with her own self worth/success and deals with it by making others feel inferior.", "It sounds like she feels you have to pay for your own meal simply because you don't have a high paying job like she does. Or am I just reading this wrong?", "NTA: Your sister doesn't matter and is lashing out because she feels irrelevant. Your dad invited you out to dinner, so his opinion on if he should pay for it is the only one that matters.", "NTA Lol sooo for her \u201cspecial occasion\u201d meal they went to a RESTAURANT with food made by CHEFS AND LINE COOKS but your job isn\u2019t important.

If she is, is she banging out 7 figure settlements? Funny thing is, as a cook you can grow, make it to sous chef then executive chef with time and experience. You get your dues in and get that opportunity you're earning power would actually be greater than hers. Had a neighbor way back when who was a millwright. Some chick boasting of needing this and that looked down on him cause her bf was lawyer making 80kna year.

You just never know.", "NTA your job isn't respectable so you have to pay for your own food? what is wrong with your sister? your dad offered to treat you all as a part of a celebration, what does the respectability of your job have to do with that? In what world is a cook not respectable?   \nIt sounds like your sister is pissed because her job is *so great* and yet she doesn't get extra special treatment for it, as if having a \"better\" job means your parents should treat her better than you? it's weird and childish", "Your sister might be certifiably insane\u2026? \n\nYou make less so YOU are the one who should pay for yourself? But the rich people get a free ride? \n\nClassic rich person.\n\nEdit: forgot my vote. NTA", "NTA. WTF? Is your sister just stupid or a snob. What they Hell does your job have to do with paying for a dinner your father had already said he was paying for? Your sister thinks way too much of herself.", "NTA & your sister is an elitist snob. I would have been petty & reminded her *who* makes the food at the restaurants she eats at & how easily that could stop due to people like her. Being a cook is a totally respectful job. Some may argue it's more so than a lawyer depending on how you feel about both professions. Either way, she's wrong & overstepping due to her prejudice. Ignore her & never cook anything for her because she obviously doesn't appreciate it with her attitude. The audacity she has shows a big degree/job can't buy someone class.", "NTA \n\nYour sisters logic makes no sense. \n\nDid she pay for her food? \n\nSince she\u2019s so much better than everyone else why didn\u2019t SHE pay for everyone?\n\nWhen your parents want to treat their children to a family dinner that\u2019s exactly they want to do. Especially if you have a old school dad. \n\nI could make 20 times my dad\u2019s salary and he would forever insist on picking up the tab at dinner. \n\nAlso I hope your sister is better at her job than she is at being a human cause she sucks", "You are a lowly cook so therefore are not worthy of your father's love or generosity.
