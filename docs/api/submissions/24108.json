This past weekend at my bridal shower I mentioned to my friend and her mom I would be inviting their family to my reception. I said this as I have not seen them since my engagement and wanted them to know they were included in my plans since I\u2019ve known them for so long (I\u2019ve known my friend since high school) and they helped plan my shower. \n\nNow a few days later, my friend texted me asking to invite her boyfriend to my reception instead of her dad. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that as we were not giving plus 1s and are strict about not inviting anyone that we both don\u2019t know. She argued with me and I said it wouldn\u2019t be fair considering I turned down some of my fianc\u00e9s long term friends because I\u2019ve never met them. She kept insisting so I flat out said \u201cim sorry but its not happening. i only want our closest people at this party and im sticking to it.\u201d now she\u2019s mad at me. \n\nI feel I should include; I have never met this boyfriend and barely know his name. She used the excuse that this would give me time to get to know him, as she doesn\u2019t want to travel here (3 hours away) unless its a holiday/event. this makes no sense to me as they regularly go on vacations and she comes around monthly without being bothered to stop by to see me or hang out. and I won\u2019t be able to spend a significant time with anyone at the party, such as weddings go. she will also know a good amount of other people, so I\u2019m not worried about her having no one to talk to. Also, I don\u2019t approve of said boyfriend. He\u2019s significantly older than my friend and the way he handles conflict in their relationship shows me theres a reason women his own age don\u2019t want him. another part of me would feel really horrible inviting her household (mom, moms bf and dad) and leaving out her dad, hence why I planned to invite them. \n\nAITA??\n\nEDIT: my fianc\u00e9 and i agreed upon these rules and have been firm about it. we discuss people that aren\u2019t a clear invite and make those decisions together. I am not forcing him to leave anyone out. those specific people are a case where he asked them to make plans and their respond was cold and they couldn\u2019t be bothered.", "created_utc": 1691425331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kpdnx/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_bring_her/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's a lot of \"I\" in this story and not too much \"we\" so it's giving off vibes that you (singular) are controlling the guest list.

The issue I think that comes into play with only inviting people you both know and excluding long-time partners is that everyone there will know YOU, but will they know anyone else? Or will they be forced to make small talk with strangers all night? I think we've moved away from weddings being a celebration of the blending of 2 people's lives to a carefully curated party that looks like perfection to the bride and groom but doesn't necessarily take the guests' comfort and enjoyment into account.", "it appears not by the responses. i specifically said they are not long term partners and im spending maybe a quarter of what you did for perspective", "we\u2019re not excluding longterm partners. she hasnt been with this person very long and regularly comes around without him. the friend specifically is the least of my worries when it comes to having others to talk to. we have a very small budget and limited guest count so we have to draw lines somewhere and this was one we decided would be fair. we do adjust the list as needed as relationships change"]}
