This past weekend at my bridal shower I mentioned to my friend and her mom I would be inviting their family to my reception. I said this as I have not seen them since my engagement and wanted them to know they were included in my plans since I\u2019ve known them for so long (I\u2019ve known my friend since high school) and they helped plan my shower. \n\nNow a few days later, my friend texted me asking to invite her boyfriend to my reception instead of her dad. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that as we were not giving plus 1s and are strict about not inviting anyone that we both don\u2019t know. She argued with me and I said it wouldn\u2019t be fair considering I turned down some of my fianc\u00e9s long term friends because I\u2019ve never met them. She kept insisting so I flat out said \u201cim sorry but its not happening. i only want our closest people at this party and im sticking to it.\u201d now she\u2019s mad at me. \n\nI feel I should include; I have never met this boyfriend and barely know his name. She used the excuse that this would give me time to get to know him, as she doesn\u2019t want to travel here (3 hours away) unless its a holiday/event. this makes no sense to me as they regularly go on vacations and she comes around monthly without being bothered to stop by to see me or hang out. and I won\u2019t be able to spend a significant time with anyone at the party, such as weddings go. she will also know a good amount of other people, so I\u2019m not worried about her having no one to talk to. Also, I don\u2019t approve of said boyfriend. He\u2019s significantly older than my friend and the way he handles conflict in their relationship shows me theres a reason women his own age don\u2019t want him. another part of me would feel really horrible inviting her household (mom, moms bf and dad) and leaving out her dad, hence why I planned to invite them. \n\nAITA??\n\nEDIT: my fianc\u00e9 and i agreed upon these rules and have been firm about it. we discuss people that aren\u2019t a clear invite and make those decisions together. I am not forcing him to leave anyone out. those specific people are a case where he asked them to make plans and their respond was cold and they couldn\u2019t be bothered.", "created_utc": 1691425331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kpdnx/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_bring_her/", "score": 365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is odd not to offer a plus one as lots of people are uncomfortable as a single at weddings, you know, the celebration of love between two people...", "As long as you're being consistent in enforcing the rules, then NTAH.", "Correct.  There are a lot of other things to do when one is getting married that take priority over getting to know a friend's boyfriend.", "Well the last aita post I read was about a cousin not inviting OP's step child because they weren't \"real family\" so I think there are some exceptions to that rule.", "thank you\ud83e\udd79", "are weddings without plus ones really this unheard of ? not everyone can afford massive weddings and thats not exactly the time for introductions. as i stated she\u2019ll know more than enough people and would have her parents there", "Is there any possibility she is pushing this because he is controlling and won't allow her to attend without him? You still don't need to invite him, but it may mean you can be a support person if/when she catches on and needs help leaving.", "Some people want small weddings, drawing a line like they did helps keep it small. The great thing about weddings is everyone gets to decide the kind they prefer to have", "[removed]", "Personally I would plan for a plus one and limit the total number of people at the reception.  If those I love want to bring someone, I trust their judgement.  If they'd prefer to come solo, they can as well.\n\nA wedding with her parents is not the same as a wedding with her date.  You want to go to a romantic event with your parents?", "it\u2019s possible but if the case, she\u2019s not being honest with me about it at this time. with everything i know about her i think this is more so a cause of her being naive and over stepping. she similarly tried to invite a mutual past coworker to my shower/bach and i had to put my foot down. although i have nothing against this person, i havent spent time with them in a decade and they\u2019re her friend, not mine. she didnt take well to this either but seems to have let it go", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

How much are you spending per guest?\n\nYou control the guest list by budgeting for a wedding you can afford and inviting people and their guest.  Or you can have \"your day\" which is seemingly the goal for you.", "have you checked the cost of weddings? 10s of thousands for the bare minimum. we dont want and can\u2019t afford that so we opted for the elope and have a reception later option with a tiny budget. \n\nwe have a set budget and discussed a guest list count with the venue when we toured so we know we\u2019re within range. we\u2019re having an extremely low budget party to avoid taking out a load so we can maybe afford a house someday. and isnt anyones wedding -their day \u00bf the day the bride and groom plan and spend all this money on for themselves? or should i put myself into debt accommodating people who only want to show up on special occasions ? if we dont draw a line the day we\u2019re dreaming of is no longer ours and we wont get to enjoy any of it.", "NTA I would allow plus one to anyone attending because personally I think it is rude to not do it. It is your wedding tho and I don't think that makes you TA.", "NTA", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. Why can't people understand that?\nMy husband & I got married in 2020. We had a very small wedding...a little over 30 ppl. Our rule was: the invitees had to have met both of us. Some of my extended family didn't even know I was dating or engaged so they didn't get invited.", ">Also, I don\u2019t approve of said boyfriend. He\u2019s significantly older than my friend and the way he handles conflict in their relationship shows me theres a reason women his own age don\u2019t want him. \n\nWait..didn't you say you've never met him and barely know his name? So how do you know all this about him?\n\nESH, Her for pushing, you for not being honest about...\\*something\\*... But your wedding, so your call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> and she comes around monthly without being bothered to stop by to see me or hang out. \n\nAh. OTOH, what does that have to do with anything? On the other, sounds like you're using the no +1 rule to punish her for choosing to travel with her boyfriend -- whom you don't know or like, yet seem to know a lot about him -- instead of visiting you in the past.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you are doubting your decision at all. You seem 100% set on it. Your replies clearly show you think your choice is completely ok. I\u2019m not sure why you are asking \u201cAITA\u201d when you really just want people to validate your choice for some reason. Don\u2019t worry about what others think. It\u2019s your wedding - do what you want. If there end up being consequences for your choices that you don\u2019t like\u2026such is life.", "[removed]", "NTA", "NTA. I think it's rude of her to expect you to exclude her father for a man who you don't even know. This is very strange behavior. Tell her she is welcome not to come", "THANK YOU\ud83d\ude2d getting married is a nightmare to begin with and i just want my closest people. anything more will be so much stress for us", "she\u2019s regularly here and i invite her over every time. i feel like ive extended the branch too many times with no reciprocity. and this rule is applying to all. my fiance isnt giving his friends plus ones unless theyre living together/married/engaged either to keep it fair and without our limits", "honestly if someone who claims to be my friend cant understand the mental and financial strain, then are they a friend? maybe im set in my ways bc i could never imagine doing this to one of my friends especially when they explicitly explain their feelings and reasoning", "is your partner important enough to introduce them to someone you call a best friend? thats where im confused. why not meet me halfway and try to get together first so everyone can be comfortable", "You aren\u2019t even sending invites until next year? I wouldn\u2019t worry about it at this point in that case. Wait and see where the relationship goes. They might be broken up by then OR they could be engaged. I think if they are engaged though, you\u2019d have to invite him.", "You said she comes by monthly and doesn't spend any time with you so why is she invited?", "She has only 75 people that will be invited. You can't invite just anyone with this number", "So that \\*is\\* part of the issue. She's regularly in town but \"doesn't bother to stop by to see me or hang out\" / \"i feel like ive extended the branch too many times with no reciprocity.\"  She's hurt your feelings in addition to you don't like her partner (who takes her on vacations).\n\nSure, you're applying the rule to all, but based on your own words, with her specifically you've got a bit of a punitive edge going on.\n\nAs someone else said, she's not single. \n\nIt's perfectly okay to realize adult relationships can change with time. People drift apart.", "I try and tell myself \u201cdo what you think is right\u201d and it never steers me wrong! If you think you are doing the right thing, then don\u2019t give it a second more of your time.", "this is also why im a bit thrown. if my boundary is to meet him, and i outright said invites are going out next year, why wouldnt she want to meet me halfway and plan for us to meet up? im also thrown off she made an issue of this now", "i talk to her often enough and included her parents as they\u2019ve done a lot for me over the years. i felt like that was a nice thing to do", "Yeah that is pretty wild. I couldn't imagine making that kinda rule or asking my finance if he was cool with that.", "the issue to me is the expectation i break the rule for her when she claims to have no time to hang out with me or stop by when shes passing by. its okay to be more distant friends but then she cant be expecting special treatment", "But did you miss the part where she wants OP to disinvite her own dad to bring this dude?", "Right? It's just not how real life works. I have good friends I invited to our wedding who my husband hadn't met because they lived in different cities. He had friends at work he invited who I hadn't met before for whatever reason.\n\nWhen someone is important to your spouse, you make space for them instead of excluding them. It's such a weird attitude and an arbitrary way to cut the list down", "You're still hosting guests and have an expectation to be good hosts. It is your day, but you don't disrespect guests and their relationships in pursuit of your vision. When you're deciding on numbers, you include partners and go from there.", "im confused here, am i really supposed to put myself into financial strain to be seen as respectful? thats outrageous", "No and that doesn't make you an AH just be aware that people will remember and not invite you to theres", "No but if you can budget for 50 people, friend and their partner are two of those people. If you can't accommodate all your guests properly you either start tightening the guest list by eliminating couples or you start cutting things you're spending on.", "if someone can respect my budget theyre not a friend i want to have. i unfortunately cant just pull money out my AH", "so i should exclude my friend entirely because i dont have budget for a plus one? that seems unreasonable", "NTA I\u2019ve been on this sub a lot recently and the amount of ppl who get mad at other peoples weddings is wild. The couple should do whatever it is they want to do.", "kinda yta for having stupid arbitrary rules for invitees but it's your party. if i were in your friends shoes i wouldn't go.", "She's not really a friend any more. if she travels regularly to where you're at and doesn't make time to see you and all she cares about for this wedding is bringing her boyfriend, not being there for you, it says a lot about who she really is and what she cares about.\n\nNTA. Your wedding, you're paying for it, you get to decide who is there and who is not there.", "> I do think the idea that couples have to always be close to their partner's friends\n\nOP said literally nothing about being close to partner's friends, but having met them once before inviting them to share your biggest moment is not a big ask nor a need to be close to everyone they know. \n\nHow many guests someone is having is irrelevant to who they want there. If there are 500 or 5 guests, if you don't want someone there they shouldn't be there.", "The edit wasn\u2019t there when I responded.", "If this is your best friend you should trust her judgment and assume that this guys going to be awesome. \n\nAlthough, given your personality, maybe she does have bad taste", "Agreed, she wasn\u2019t the center of the invite, she was a part of the Family\u2019s invite. It\u2019s impressive how inconsiderate she is wanting her dad to get disinvited for someone she\u2019s dated less than a year and knows no one in the wedding party.", "I saw that, but since invites went out already I assumed her dad bowed out and she asked if the boyfriend could take his place or that it was otherwise sorted in the family. Admittedly, I may have misinterpreted that part, and if she\u2019s asking the bride to rescind an invitation to a guest in order to invite her boyfriend that\u2019s definitely a horrible thing to do.", "Unfortunately, you did\n\n>my friend texted me asking to invite her boyfriend to my reception instead of her dad. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that as we were not giving plus 1s and are strict about not inviting anyone that we both don\u2019t know.", "My apologies for the misinformation, but invites aren\u2019t out yet? It\u2019s terrible she\u2019s trying to uninvite her dad and awful to try to influence your guest list but you\u2019re also rude to exclude her partner.", "Nah. She doesn't know this dude, her friend never met him and she only has 75 invites. Her friend doesn't need to come. It's ruder to demand someone be uninvited to invite someone she doesn't even know", "I agree, her friend doesn\u2019t need to come. If she\u2019s miffed she can stay home and OP can plan the wedding she likes. She can take this opportunity to uninvite the friend. But those decisions will impact your relationship after the wedding day. It\u2019s awful to try to convince someone to exclude your dad, but since I don\u2019t have a shot of reaching her and I might reach OP, I thought it was worth mentioning people in committed relationships don\u2019t like celebrating committed relationships when they feel their relationship is being disrespected.", "True Facts!\n\n\\*She\\* should not expect special treatment with the +1 rule you and future hubby have set.\n\n\\*You\\* should acknowledge that there's a lot more emotionally in play with You when it comes to Her \\*specific\\* invite.\n\nYou don't like her partner. You don't see their time together as Valid according to  your rules. You're hurt she did not set aside time to visit you when she and the partner you don't approve of were in the neighborhood in the past.\n\nBased on your words here...why is she the only one you're \"punishing\" via invite? Cuz that's what it looks like to me.\n\nit may be helpful for you to \\*truly\\* sit with that and think about it.\n\nYour wedding and rules.\n\nBut.\n\nAnd.\n\nJust sayin'", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s Your Wedding,You Shouldn\u2019t Have To Invite Anyone You Don\u2019t Want To", "NTA  \nYou are in control of who you invite, they are in control of whether they attened - it's as simple as that.", "NTA it's your wedding, not her's", "I'd have a small gathering in my back yard before I told friends their SO was too expensive to include.  And hint, you've already taken out a \"load\".  Good luck with that.", "Touch\u00e8"]}
