{"id": 28173, "submission_id": "16ythz7", "title": "AITA for wanting to tell my neighbor that she needs to control her kids or I will report her?", "selftext": "I (32f) live in a quiet townhouse with my sons (4&6) and 2 dogs (Boarder/Heeler & Dutch/Heeler). Each townhouse has small yards with pourches in the front/back, and a 6' privacy fences that extends about 10' from the building on each side, which is about half way from the building to the fenceline in the back/sidewalk in the front. Even when my kids go outside to play with their neighbor friends, they would all stay within the boundaries of their yard. Many neighbors have their dogs on 10' tieouts or have efences, but my dogs are always supervised/on leash when outside.\nAbout 5mo ago, a family with two young boys (6&8) moved on next door. The mother introduced herself with an upfront apology for any noise, as her boys were used to living in a house. I laughed and told her not to worry, as my boys were pretty active, too. After a few days, it became very clear that her boys did not understand boundaries as they used everyone's yards as a playground, even playing with all of the other kid's toys/bikes. I didn't say anything, as I understood that this was a big change for them and assumed that their mother would teach them. Unfortunately, this was not the case. When I politely came out to ask them not to tap on my windows to say \"hi\" to my dogs, she completely ignored me. They are left to roam unsupervised outside for most of the day, though she is usually home. Even when other neighborhood kids came to her because her sons were being bullies, she would comfort them and assure them that her boys did nothing wrong, like telling a 4yr old that she shouldn't be wearing such short shorts around a 6yr/o boy.\nMy dogs are still young, but we train at least 2hrs a day, they both have their good citizens certification, and the Dutch mix is on track to become an ASD/Cardio Alert service dog for my 6yr/o. Both of them started developing reactivity due to her boys constantly (unintentionally) terrorizing them, which is probably going to add another year ($6-9k) of training. This was a huge blow, as my son struggles to function independently, was recently diagnosed with CHD, and I can not describe the level of investment this is as a single mother. I even got special accommodations to take this dog to work with me the past year so we can have her in continuous training. \n  I found out two days ago that her youngest was bit by a neighbors dog as he was trying to \"borrow\" some toys from their back pourch, and nothing has changed. At this point, we do not feel safe/comfortable in our home as is constantly sounds like someone is breaking in, cannot enjoy/use our yards, and we have enough people in our neighborhood with large/untrained dogs that these kids are going to end up seriously hurt if something doesn't change. \nI understand that it is not my place as they are not my kids, that they are just kids, and that is why I have yet to take any action. So, should if I put my foot down and stepped in, or just stay out of it?\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for all of the support, and i feel like I should clarify some things. First, I have been regularly reminding the children that they need to respect the boundaries of our property and have explained to them how their actions are affecting others, though in a very gental tone. Aside from a select couple of neighbor kids that I allow my children to play with in our yard, we keep to ourselves, and her parenting style is more common than ours in our complex. Lastly, we live in the only income restricted/affordable housing in a very affluental neighborhood (US). It has always been so quiet because they quickly evict anyone who draws police/attention, but also, because many of our neighbors are not people you would want to get in an altercation with. Meaning the consequences of speaking out would likely be retaliation on my family and leaving these young children homeless or in foster care. \nAgain, I hold their mother fully responsible for everything, but my hesitation is in regards to the effect it will have on both my children and hers.", "created_utc": 1696343516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ythz7/aita_for_wanting_to_tell_my_neighbor_that_she/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes me very concerned for what she is teaching those boys. At this point, it sounds like everyone around them has had negative experiences with these boys and their mother. If you want to try to confront her, get together with the other neighbors so that you look have a plan to deal with the situation and stick to it. Obviously these boys are in need of supervision which mom should be providing.", "Nta. Since the mom is not teaching her children proper behavior next time they are in your yard or near your dogs you will have to be the teacher. Stop them and tell them they are not allowed in your yard or near your dog without your permission.

Report their trespassing and harassment of your dogs to the hoa and the police. No need to consider the consequences for your actions since their mom does not.

NTA", "Thank you, and I do understand that if these were adult's, they would already be in jail. I guess that my hesitation is that I this is the mother's fault, yet I know the children will be the ones to suffer the consequences. Another note is that we live in the only income restricted complex in a rich neighborhood (CO, US), with a very strict policy that you are quickly evicted if you become involved with the police. This is why it has always been so quiet. I don't want to live like this or have them get hurt, but I also don't want them to be homeless or end up in foster care. I swear, I am not usually such a pushover, but they are 6 and 8.", "Thank you, and I have no intention or interest in holding them responsible for my dog's additional training. This is just a frustrating result of the situation. I would also like to note that I am very experienced with these breeds, and our Dutch mix will be my 7th service dog I have trained. They have been extensively socialized since they were puppies and have never had reactivity before now as we had taken all the correct preventative steps in time. The Dutch mix was 19mo into training, had already mastered intelligent disobedience, and had been joining my son at school/hospitals for 10 weeks when they moved in. She only had about 3 months left to finish her cardiac alert and response training. Even though she is still sound outside of the home, and it's not the barking reactivity you may be referring to, it is enough that we had to pull her. He relies on her for everything from knowing when he needs to go potty, detecting cardiac episodes, blocking self-harm during meltdowns, keeping him from running into trafic (very little environmental awareness/Impulse control), monitors/contains him when sleepwalking, and more.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm a bit defensive over this, but she is not a pet. She is a medical tool. I will have to retrain the boarder/heeler as well, but the consequences of her regressing in training is irrelevant compared to the Dutch mix, as my son's health and safety do not depend on her being 100%. I should also note that as a service dog, it is a felony to hinder her training or ability to perform.", ">the first one to file \n\nI don't disagree with you.  Unfortunately, that's the world we live in.", "We aren\u2019t born knowing boundaries, and what\u2019s okay, what isn\u2019t. We have to be taught. If their guardians aren\u2019t doing it, you need to. \n\nOur neighbors have a big family, some blended, some not. In total it\u2019s something like 10-15 kids under 13. They don\u2019t live there but my neighbor provides childcare for some of them, so at any given time there\u2019s a mess of kids around. They like to come over and play with my kid. Every so often I\u2019ll find some evidence they\u2019ve been playing with some of the outside toys, or messing around in our backyard. \n\nWhenever that has happened I\u2019ve talked to my neighbor *and* the kid. Typically I\u2019ll see the kid first, say something then I\u2019ll text my neighbor to let them know I said something and what I said. I\u2019ll also talk to the kids parents if I can. I\u2019m not \u201ctelling on them\u201d but I\u2019m just letting them know what I said and what I did to correct some behavior, and if they have any advice or anything to say about it.

Sure, they *should* know, but either they do and don\u2019t care, or they don\u2019t. Either way you\u2019re letting them know you don\u2019t appreciate it, and you\u2019ll say something.", "I understand and empathize. When you do have any conversation it\u2019s best to leave that out is all", "Right. I mean, she SHOULD be able to warn her about going to the apartment manager, like you said, in order to give her a chance to fix things. But there\u2019s some pretty sneaky people out there who will try to beat her to the punch and say something about how her dogs are intemperate or whatever. I guess she just has to decide what she thinks this person would do."]}
