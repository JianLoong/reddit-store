{"id": 32563, "submission_id": "18d19bj", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter (who is facing homelessness) that only her and the baby can move in with me, not her husband?", "selftext": "The husband has lived in their apartment for a number of years. The owners recently sold it and the new ones are moving in, so my daughter and her husband have to move. The problem is rents have gone up dramatically. The rent they are paying is $1100 (for a 1 bedroom), which I thought was a lot, but now that I'm trying to help them find a place, most are now going for around $2000 a month or more! They can't afford this.\n\nMy daughter knows she is always welcome at home, granted a baby complicates things. I wasn't happy about her having a baby (she's young, just turned 22), but I would never deny her housing. However, I can't stand her husband (let's just call him Aaron for simplicity's sake). I wouldn't invite Aaron over for dinner, let alone let him live with me. Aaron's in his mid 30s. Criminal history. Hair trigger temper. Chronically immature and has one hell of a jealous/possessive streak that has caused strain in their relationship (which I obviously do not approve of).\n\nHonestly, when she told me she was pregnant, I finally thought we'd be rid of Aaron. I genuinely thought he's exactly the kind of man to ditch (they've been on and off over and over since she was about 18/19). Alas, if anything it made him cling to her tighter. They had a very rushed wedding and this is their longest stint together without any breakups. Just over a year. There's still been the fair share of dramatics, of course, but I am surprised they've made it this far.\n\nEven so, I simply don't want to live with Aaron. I don't like him. I don't want him around me. I'd go above and beyond for my daughter and the baby, they can stay as long as they need, but not him. \n\nObviously, this has created a rift between my daughter and I. She doesn't want to live separately from Aaron. I told her then she needs to figure out alternative arrangements. Well, their move out date is rapidly approaching (the 15th of December) and they've still not been able to find a place, and she's panicking. She's been begging me to let them stay.\n\nI reiterated my terms. Aaron simply cannot stay here. This led to a lot of tears and some angry words. Namely, me being an asshole. I can genuinely see why she might think that, but I also have to think about myself and my own sanity. Right?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701971680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d19bj/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_who_is_facing/", "score": 59, "replies": ["NTA.\n\nYour home - your rules.  You have a legitimate basis for not wanting him living there.  You\u2019re housing your daughter and her baby out of the goodness of your heart.  You are doing a big favor for her!\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t sacrifice your sense of security and safety and sanity to accommodate a man with a criminal background that has a violent temper that you\u2019ve experienced.\n\nThey\u2019re also not out of options from you drawing that line.\n\nIf daughter can\u2019t live without husband- they can live somewhere else.", "NTA. This is going to probably get worse before it gets better but always make sure your daughter knows she has a safe place with you.  Hopefully one day she\u2019ll wake up and realize how bad he is and she can return home in order to get back on her feet.  As for Aaron, I\u2019d never let him enter my house either.", "NTA. But I would be careful, this could be very bad for your daughter. I have a close family friend who was married to a guy exactly like Aaron. When she had his newborn baby he had them living a tent. Not a camper, a tent - with a newborn. If she is scared enough of him  or being away from him (and it sounds like she is), she and her baby could end up in a dangerous living condition. I am not saying let him in your house, that is not the solution. Just be very kind to your daughter even if she is pushing you away. She is most likely pushing you away because Aaron has convinced her that you hate her in some way or another or that you don't care about her. This is a classic abuse tactic called isolating. In this case, it's actually very unlikely that she agrees to move in with you without him because her world is probably so small at this point that she can't imagine not being around him (especially considering she met him as a teenager/young adult). Just know that even though she's pushing you away, she does not actually want that. Enduring abuse can ruin a person, turn them into somebody you don't even recognize. Wherever she ends up living, just be there for her as much as possible and no matter what do not fight back and argue with her, it will only solidify that isolation because she'll feel like \"oh wow he was right, she actually doesn't care about me.\" Again, abuse ruins people. She may have some absolutely crazy ideas in her mind that you don't even know about it. This is a really difficult situation and you may just watch it get much worse before it gets better, and I really feel for you. Hopefully with enough kind and tender-loving care she will see that you can be a rock for her separation from him, or at the very least realize that you do care for her.", "NTA. However be prepared for the fallout.", "NTA, but this could backfire in a way that makes it so he has an easier time isolating her from you. Just keep that in mind please.", "NTA.\n\nIf you let this loser into your house you\u2019ll never get him out. \n\nShe wants to make big girl decisions like getting married and having a baby with this loser, then let her deal with the big girl consequences. \n\nYou\u2019ve done all you can do.", "INFO - what is their job/income situation? Could they qualify for housing assistance, WIC, SNAP, or other government programs that could help them afford their own place? Maybe you can support them by helping them navigate the application processes for that. Assuming that process goes past their eviction date, daughter and baby can stay with you, and husband can stay in a hotel or something temporarily. \n\nNTA for not wanting to live with someone you don't trust and can't stand in general, but as others have mentioned, this will isolate your daughter from you. If he has abusive tendencies, he could very much take advantage of that. You have to be more diplomatic than you feel is justified and play a bit of a long game here if you want your relationship with your daughter to survive.", "I mean... \"I'll only help you and your kid, but your husband needs to be homeless\" or \"I'll help you when you leave your husband\" are AH things. NAH to me though.\n\nYou have every right to decide who does or does not get to stay in your home, but I've no doubt this will be the end if your relationship with your daughter, and the last you see of that grandkid. \n\nIf she has to throw together emergency housing in the middle of winter, or be homeless as opposed to leaving her husband, she's not going to ever forget that. She has every right to not want her husband to be homeless, regardless of how you feel about him.\n\nIn the end, every answer to this sucks. Either you'll have someone staying with you that you seriously dislike or you'll have a daughter that has legitimate reasons to hate you.", "I m saying very gently YTA, the more you protest him the harder she\u2019s going to try to make it work. I mean they\u2019re evicted due to no fault of their own. Is this were my sister whose bf I cannot stand I would Criminal proof the home, valuables, financials etc in a safe or deposit box, mail to a PO box if you re out during the day. Cameras to catch any behaviour that occurs during the stay. This man will bounce on his own by the time the baby comes, you\u2019re not villain and your baby girl is safely with you.", "NTA, but what other ways can you support them? It's not reasonable to ask your daughter to leave her husband. Are you able to help with a deposit or childcare?\n\nI would give them options rather than saying it's leave her husband or nothing.", "I'm going with YTA because I think you think this could be the way to get Aaron away from your daughter because you don't approve of their relationship because he's older, has a criminal past and knocked your daughter up which you also disapprove of. Be very careful OP because this could backfire on you. Maybe you should've been more persuasive before they got serious.", "SMH", "OP can support her by not giving up on the daughter, providing encouragement, even when the daughter is angry. Remain resolute. OP is doing this out of love, not to be mean. \n\nOP, I think it will get worse before it gets better as far as your daughter being mad. I think she knows she\u2019s married to a bum, but being young, doesn\u2019t realize that being without baby daddy isn\u2019t the end of the world. \n\nAs far as supporting her, keep communication open, and secretly sock money aside for her should she need resources to leave.", "Remaining \"resolute\" and providing empty \"encouragement\" isn't support. It's fine if you think that's all OP should do, but don't pretend it's in any way helpful.", "Short term? No. Long term? Yes.", "It's not, though. Support is actually helping. Not being \"resolute\" in not helping."]}
