I\u2019m not.\n\nMy girlfriend moved in with me about 2 years ago, and she brought her cat with her, Luna. I was not against it at all at first. Luna was litter trained and generally well behaved whenever I had seen her at my partners house.\nMe and Luna always got on so I never thought twice about it.\n\nLuna didn\u2019t adjust well to moving. I understood it was a big thing for a cat and my place was unfamiliar. She didn\u2019t use her litter tray for the first couple of weeks, which again I was a bit peeved at but understood. But she got generally very nasty as well. Within a few months my every time I would walk past her she would hiss and bat at me, even with my partner. She\u2019s become a pretty unlikeable cat. We\u2019ve spoken to the vets about it countless times, and they haven\u2019t been much help. They did recommend these cat calmer things that plug into the wall and release some sort of scent? I don\u2019t know specifically but it was horribly expensive and didn\u2019t seem to help much anyway. Even now , about 2 years later, Luna still sometimes chooses not to use her litter tray, and we find it in corners.\n\nRecently she\u2019s now moved on to scratching walls and furniture even though she has a scratch post in the living room and where her bed is. I\u2019m convinced she knows what she is doing is wrong, but does it anyway. I feel I\u2019ve tried to get her to adjust but she just won\u2019t. My partner is blinded by the love for her, and I do truly get it but something has surely got to give? \n\nI raised the matter with my partner, and she cried and asked me not to make her chose. That\u2019s not what I did. I didn\u2019t say she absolutely had to get rid of her, I just wanted a frank conversation of what our options were at this point, and if there was anything else we could do. She won\u2019t speak to me about it at all and just shuts me down about it.\n\nI really don\u2019t want it to get to the point that I make her chose, but what else can I do? She\u2019s destroyed my living room sofa, our headboard on our bed and the rooms smell of cat pee, I\u2019m pretty sure carpet is going to have to be replaced. \n\nTLDR: Partners cat has become very mean, and picks and chooses when she uses the litter tray, and destroys household items. AITA for asking her to discuss options with me on what we could do to help Luna?\n\nEDITED\n\nI did NOT give my SO an ultimatum, it\u2019s how she took it when I brought up having a discussion about the situation and what we could do to help Luna. I never once said get rid of her. Sorry for the confusion, I\u2019m a bit scatter brained and trying to explain a 2 year situation in one post is difficult. I do also have dyslexia, so sorry if some parts aren\u2019t written correctly or don\u2019t make sense.\n\nEDIT 2\n\nGoing to stop replying now, don\u2019t think I\u2019ve typed this much in years. Head is frazzled. But I just want to say, thank you all for your suggestions. Even the people who thought I was the AH here, 90% of you were constructive and gave your opinions and suggestions on what I could do, I really appreciate that. I\u2019ve written down a lot of stuff, and plan to take it to my SO and talk about what\u2019s next. Not sure what the general consensus is on me, but I\u2019ll take it whatever it is, I\u2019ll be the asshole if it means we get this cat into a happier state.

Clearly Luna is struggling and deserves the help.", "Not giving judgement, as clearly you are open to helping the animal, but I concur that you might want to talk with a behaviorist.  Something has stressed this cat that she is still so upset so long after the move.  Maybe there is something about the new place that she just can't stand--a cat that lived there before, who knows.  A behaviorist might be able to help you figure that out so that the question doesn't need to be asked.  No one wants to live with the constant destruction or smell of cat pee so clearly something needs to be done and I say that as the devoted slave of three cats.  The kitty is not happy either, hence these issues.", "1. Try adding a second litter box.

You were offered a cat pheromone plug in, but decided 40 bucks was too much. What about a second Litter box? How often does the litter box get changed? What about A longer scratching post? A cat tree? You set up a safe space for the cat? Do you have play time with the cat every day?   \n\n\nIf cats are engaging with something you don't like, you need to create something more interesting in the room you want them to engage with. It doesn't need to be expensive, a fresh cardboard box can go a long way. Carboard absorbs their scent, so they'll rub it and feel better with that carboard there, cause it's familiar.   \n\n\nIf they are having litter box trouble, get a second litter box. If they keep urinating in a specific spot, put the litter box there. Do not yell or rub their nose in their urine because to be blunt, cats don't understand what you're trying to communicate. All they understand it \"You are a scary threat! I live with that!\" Positive reinforcement works better. Had a small hiccup with my cat when I moved in with my SO and she was peeing by the front door. I couldn't put a litter box there, so when home and I noticed she went into her litter box, I gave her a treat.

Has your girlfriend offered to pay for or fix anything that has been destroyed?\n\nThis is your home too. If your gf refuses to discuss at all you could try getting a mediator involved (if she agrees to talk about it in that setting).\n\nIt sounds like she gave you an ultimatum though, so you have to decide whether you stay or go.", "Nta. I'm surprised this hasn't been mentioned,  and I know that the couch is already torn up, but double sided tape. Put it where she scratches most, and she'll stop.", "I think ESH\n\nAnd I also find so many of these comments not helpful and just belittling both of you, so here's my 2 cents.\nFirst of all, get a better vet, because they are clearly clueless.\nCats are insanely smart and sensitive creatures, despite what people say. Yes they can be mean, but they are very loyal.\n\nHere's my suggestions:\nUse catnip or catnip spray to make her scratch posts more interesting, look at a ton of interactive toys, like lasers, mice that have wheels, feathers on a stick and whatnot.\nMake sure she has lots of hiding places.\nFree some room up on windowsills so kitty can check out what's going on outside.\n\nThere are homeopathic solutions for nervous cats that are not harming their health, maybe look at those.\nGet a cat repellant spray for the furniture so she won't scratch it. Get a sofa cover.\nMaybe get those scratchy posts things you can put up on walls where she has scratched before to protect the wall.\nNow foe the not using her litter tray matter, there are few reasons she may be doing this. Is it always the same litter? Maybe she's allergic, doesn't like it when it lumps (mine hates it), it has a chemical or flowery smell that irritates her or it doesn't get cleaned enough.\nTry to bond with her through play time and feeding time, as in only you feed her and she can connect you to something positive. I'm absolutely a fan of bribing animals with food, so arm yourself with snacks (obviously be careful with overfeeding :D )\nNow as a very ott solution, maybe look at getting another cat, cats are very social and are less bored or frustrated if they have a play pal, but obviously that's a big thing but I wanted to throw it out there.\n\nThere absolutely are professional cat trainers who can help if you feel like you need a professional outside opinion.\n\nBut both you and your gf went about the conversation wrong, so just talk openly and respectfully and find a compromise.\nMaybe the cat is annoyed by getting less attention, they are needy little things just like small children but they can also give you a lot of joy when you earn their trust.\n\nNow all of this is obviously just helping if you have ruled out any medical reasons or health issues she may have.\n\nAnyway, please keep up updated :)\n\nEditing this to add: I'm REALLY sorry, but it sounds like your gf doesn't actually know too much about cats and their psyche. educate yourself together because cats are amazing! heck, look at teaching her tricks! check out that show on Netflix about cats, it's brilliant. try to enjoy yourself with the fur baby and learn about them. you'll all be happier for it", "NTA It's completely understandable that you are raising the option of rehoming a clearly miserable cat. On the other hand, it doesn't sound to me like you've necessarily tried everything. I would post this on /r/pets and see if anyone there can give you some other ideas to try. \n\nI've had the experience of having a cat pissing all over the house and I resolved it by not letting my cat go into the garage. Sounds nuts, but I observed that he was getting into fights with my other cat whenever he came out of there. Seems like my other cat thought he smelled different whenever he returned. Cats are extremely attuned to scent so I wonder if 1) he doesn't like something about your smell and 2) your entire apartment now smells like a litter box.", "I completely understand how awful this is for you. My dog had some medical needs that made her constantly leak on the floor. The house stink and it was terrible. But if I had to genuinely choose, I would ALWAYS choose my pet. No question. I think you need to prepare yourself for the possibility that she will choose the cat if you ultimately can\u2019t work out a genuine compromise or solution. And if she does choose you, I think you should also understand that there will likely be long term resentment that will ultimately end the relationship. NAH and I\u2019m sorry this is happening. It\u2019s possible her cat is not comfortable are you specifically too. That happens and in that case there\u2019s not much to be done it seems.", "NTA can the cat be confined to one or two rooms plus have a protected outside cattery,  or tunnels, to alleviate boredom?

Since the cat has been checked by vets, it seems there is just something it isn't happy with. I have two cats, and the only time one didn't use the litter was when they were sick. Does the litter box get cleaned daily? A dirty litter box can make them use other spots. Is the cat fixed? Has there been a change in food? Many things can upset a cat. Think of anything that has changed since you moved in together, because it might be something very small making the cat stressed. Talk to your partner and tell her that you need help dealing with this. No communication is not going to work and she needs to realize this.", "NAH- I totally understand how you feel. Lived with a roommate for 2 years whose cat was like this. Repeatedly went to the bathroom out of the litterbox and nothing we did would help. The vet said it was all behavioural and there was nothing they could do. It was horrible, the house constantly reeked of cat urine and feces. We stopped having people over cause it was so embarrassing. You have a right to live in a home (that you pay for) that won't be destroyed. \n\nOn the other hand this is your GF's pet. It would be wrong of her to just get rid of it because of this, she is the one who took on the responsibility and can't just get rid of the cat. I think the two of you need to sit down and have a serious conversation about your priorities and boundaries, but if you're girlfriend continues to shut you down... I don't have much hope for this relationship", "NTA at all - you tried to communicate with your partner and they shut you down and will not even discuss it.

Are either you or your SO playing with the cat regularly/daily? \nIt sounds like the cat is bored and insecure. If you have neighbors or a big yard outside there may be other cats around making yours want to mark.

They need play time , toys and attention.", "NAH. That does sound frustrating so I can't completely fault you, but suggesting your GF get rid of her cat is not going to end well, and you should probably make that up to her. Likewise, she's clearly at a loss for how to help the cat, but ignoring the problem isn't going to work either. \n\nSo, some advice - there are 3 reasons for the issues I see as plausible. I'll try to give some suggestions for each, and hopefully one will help. \n\n1. Luna doesn't like you. I'm sorry to say it but if she's hissing and batting at you specifically, this seems the most likely. Have you tried to form any kind of bond with the cat? Does she get enough play and cuddle time with you around? Maybe there's just a behavior that's specifically setting her off and making her act out (could be something as simple as wearing shoes around the house, I used to have a cat that would FLIP at that). Try a couple weeks of being extra quiet, calm, and gentle around her, take over feeding & provide treats, play with her a few times each day, and see if that makes any difference.\n\n2. Luna doesn't like something in your place. Given the litter box issues, an upsetting smell or similar may be the issue (for example, maybe a dog used to live there and she's reacting to that). Give the floors and such a good clean, use air filters to help mitigate ambient scents, and maybe get a few cat safe plants that improve air quality. Giving her multiple \"safe\" places to hang out may help too (a cat tree or bed raised off the floor w/catnip inside, wash some blankets with unscented detergent to lay around, etc). \n\n3. Luna is hurt/sick. You've taken her to the vet, so hopefully this one is unlikely, but if the above things don't work, you should seek a second opinion just in case. Its possible that during the move, she hurt herself in some way. Or that something in the new place is making her ill (different water or food, pesticides/cleaning products used around the place, or even a contaminant in the air). Try to rule things out one by one and see if there are any changes. \n\nIf none of that works... well Luna needs somewhere she isn't stressed out of her mind, and for whatever reason that's not your place. Clearly something there is not okay with her, and it's just not healthy for a cat to live in that kind of state long-term. If you and your GF cannot provide her a stable home there, she should not be there. Whether that means having separate places again, splitting up, or finding Luna a better home, that's mostly up to your GF. But the poor thing sounds miserable, so somethings gotta give.", "NTA- and I think you have to draw a line and say- Hey- I can't do the thing where we pretend that there isn't a problem. You refuse to discuss or address it which leaves me to decide exactly to what degree I'm comfortable living in cat piss and with destroyed furniture. Let me just say, I'm not. So, I need you to be willing to have a discussion about where we go from here that doesn't require me to live in cat piss.", "Some really good suggestions here. I hope you Luna and your SO can work this out. Something has upset the cat and it\u2019s definitely worth looking into. Best of luck", "NTA - Luna was probably this way before moving in with you and you just didnt see the behaviors until moving in together.

So at this point, it is a sunk cost and there is no need to force an ultimatum on your partner.\n\nWhat you do need to do is consider whether your relationship is compatible given your different prioritization of property/pets.

It may be possible to start eliminating them in the future, but err on the side of caution for now. May not hurt to have a checkup for the cat as well and make sure there isn't anything medically wrong luke a uti.\n\nClip the cat's nails about every other week. Cats scratch to wear their nails down, so if her nails are kept short she won't feel the urge to scratch as much. If she likes catnip use it on the appropriate scratching areas often.\n\nYou need to become the source of all good things for a while. You feed the cat, you give the cat treats, you have playtime with the cat every day. The cat has clearly decided that you are a threat, which is why a lot of this behavior is happening.

Start digging and doing all the research you can, and look up Jackson Galaxy on YouTube for some good tips. \n\nI know it seems weird, but scheduled meal times (instead of free feeding) with scheduled playtime right beforehand helps with a lot of behavioral issues. Cats love routine and predictably, so give her as much of that as you can. \n\nAlso, do you live in an area with a lot of unfixed stray cats outside? This might be really triggering her, some cats are very worried about unfamiliar kitties in their territory, even if she can just see/smell them through the window. This would explain her going outside the box and scratching things up to mark her territory. If possible, maybe work with a local TNR organization to get the feral cats trapped & fixed. Sometimes they can even be relocated as barn cats! \n\nI know all of this sounds like a pain in the ass, but pets are family and you have to keep trying.

Some less expensive options that may be help with the territory would be: more scratchers around the house, a good enzymatic cleaner to make sure lingering outside the litter boxes smells aren't present (cats can smell where they've gone before and return), additional litter boxes. There may also be things you can do to help the cat not treat you as an invader. Participating in feeding time and play time will help them bond with you. Another trick I learned is slow blinking.

NTA for being frustrated, but YWBTA if you made her choose between you and the cat.  \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was that the cat shouldn't be scratching furniture because she has ONE scratching post--in a bedroom.  Cats need a scratching surface in every room, and some prefer vertical, some prefer horizontal, and some may like a variety.  And litter boxes--some cats have very strong preference for style of the box itself, kind of litter used, etc.  And even a single-cat home would do well to have at least two boxes.

Consult reputable sites for examples--I second the Jackson Galaxy recommendation, but I'm sure there are others.

You'll start to get a feel for which ones the kitty actually uses and likes.  And if kitty's behavior and attitude improves, great, then you can start phasing out ONE item at a time (the ones you've noticed she doesn't use as much) and get down to just a couple scratching places and a couple litter boxes total.  \n\nBut right now you're forcing the cat to conform to YOUR preferences, and not giving her any choices in the matter, so it's not surprising she doesn't like her new situation much.", "Okay fair assessment.

She doesn't want to \"discuss\" because OP is only trying to convince her of Option 2, even though he AGREED to have the cat when she moved in with him.", "Okay, but apart from getting rid of the cat, did u actually offer any other options? What are some of those? Or did u just state -hey this is a problem and it needs to be taken care of, leaving the conclusion that ur gf has one option (to choose between the cat and u)?", "OK.  List the options.", "Then you need to post that.  All you posted was you tried the diffusers and stopped bc they were expensive.", "If Luna has progressively gotten more aggressive, I don't think it's going to be a straightforward thing to address. At this point, she's not stressed from the move, it's something else that's bothering her. And if it's not a medical issue, then a sudden change in personality is an environmental issue. Which means yes, you and your GF need to problem solve.\n\nOne of my cats hates having an uncovered litterbox. She had tons of litterbox issues when we first got her, as soon as a cover went on it she stopped having issues, literally overnight. We have a second cat who thought poop time was pounce time, so using the litterbox became very stressful for her. As soon as the cover went on, pooping could be done in safety because the other cat couldn't get to her. Maybe Luna needs more places to hide? If you do create places for her to hide and she uses them, you and your GF should agree that you never bother her while she's there.\n\nLuna could also need more interaction/stimulation. Play time helps her bond with her humans, and feel safe in her space.\n\nYou're NTA for bringing up that Luna can't continue with the status quo. It's not fair to her, nor to her humans. Perhaps you could have worded things better that this is really about finding a way for Luna to be happy, not necessarily about dropping her off at a shelter. But I'm concerned that your GF is shutting down. That's showing inability/unwillingness to have hard conversations with her partner, and that doesn't bode well for your longevity as a couple. Certainly, if you can't problem solve for Luna as a pair, how are you going to be able to do so for a child if that's the life you want? \n\nI'd maybe reach out to a local cat rescue, not for rehoming but to get advice from people who work a lot with cats who have a wide array of problems. Perhaps they would be able to offer you some insights. And it might be worth it to look into couples counseling so that you can both work on your communication skills.", "Sure, she moved in and you share it.  But my point is, even when you share, shit hits different when things YOU purchased are destroyed. \n\nHell, even as a kid, think about furniture that was \"family furniture\". You probably didn't care nearly as much when it was destroyed.  But once you started buying things on your own, and its your money down the drain, it feels different. \n\nSo yeah, she has not invested money in the things being destroyed, so she cares much less about it.", "Your SO could try to play with Luna daily, cats need a lot of activities. My cat definitely wasn't an outdoor cat, she wouldn't have survived five minutes without me, but she loved to go outside on a leash. I had some problems with her too when I moved, but our daily walks which we weren't able to do before moving seemed to help a bit. If your cat gets scared easily I suggest at first going out at nights, if there's less distraction then. \n\nYou could try to add one more litter box for her and see if that helps.", "You might have to be persistent with the playing for a little while. A cat dangler or cat dancer where you sort of stay a metre away from the actual cat might work - cats usually love these, and you\u2019d still be the \u201csource\u201d of the good, fun thing happening, but the cat can keep a comfortable distance.", "It was a TV series about basically you're exact experiences. Might be a good couples activity to watch together, I watched it with my partner early on in our relationship and it made him very enthusiastic to add \"kitty shelves\" and other stuff when we moved in together. \n\nBasically, make sure that your cat has both high places to climb and also low spots to hide. You have to kind of learn about what makes the perfect cat environment and then try to gear your place more towards that, it's clear that your cat feels like it's in a hostile space.", "Depends if you have children, or don't/can't have them. Some people see them as their child.", "It sounds like the cat is very stressed/anxious and, being a cat, does not have less destructive outlets for those feelings. \n\nI will say, for the record, that the cat is not intentionally being \"bad\" or acting out maliciously. I know it certainly seems that way sometimes, but cats simply don't process thoughts that way. If it was one or two isolated incidents of \"I moved the cat's box and the cat ripped up the couch while glaring at me\", then yeah, sure, it might be intentional. But consistent destructive behaviors are indicative of both stress and the cat's needs not being adequately met. \n\nEspecially with the litter tray: even genuinely nasty cats don't go outside of the litter box just to upset their owners. The most common issues are location (try moving the litterbox more out-of-the-way, perhaps into one of the corners she occasionally uses instead), the litter itself (perhaps she does not like the texture/scent), or the box/tray itself (is it too small? Too open? Too closed-off?). And if she's exclusively pooping outside of the box, it could be a digestive issue. my cat will poo outside of his box if he's constipated or otherwise having difficulty pushing out a BM, for instance, not because he's a jerk, but because he associates the litterbox *with* that discomfort/difficulty when it comes to pooping. \n\nI'm no cat behavioralist or animal specialist, but that's my two cents. I've had cats all my life and also once lived with a partner whose cat was an absolute menace, not because he was just a bad cat, but because his need for attention and non-destructive stimulation weren't being met.", "Not really. She really loves her, and I get it but it seems in her eyes she can\u2019t do much wrong. That\u2019s in reality what I wanted to talk about, but it all kinda blew up in my face.", "Fair assessment there, and it\u2019s a conversation I desperately want to have to see where I stand but right now it\u2019s just not possible. I\u2019m not one for arguing, I like to discuss, but right now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what will happen if I bring it up again", "Thank you so much! that's really kind and also a great suggestion", "Thanks for the info, could definetly try to make her something so she can get higher up in the room, I know cats like that.", "My stuff was all new and I never had another pet in this house, but thanks for the suggestion", "If that was the case I don\u2019t think this would\u2019ve been going on for over two years. I\u2019m not against keeping the cat, I\u2019m against things staying the same as they are now.", "Yeah, you\u2019re right. From a lot of the comments I totally get it\u2019s not fair to ever ask her to get rid of the cat. I think I\u2019m just getting frustrated with the lack of communication.", "So having an adult conversation about strategies to mitigate this behavior isnt an option? \n\nThere seems to be a ton of suggestions already in the comments but how can OP try these if his gf wont even discuss them?", "Comprehension of the post is wrong here. I\u2019m not trying to convince my SO to get rid of the cat at all, again the orginal conversation was just a frank discussion of what\u2019s next. Unfair to unfairly represent what I said.", "I tried. I was stonewalled. She took what I meant as get rid of the cat, when in reality that\u2019s not what I said at all. I wanted to discuss options of what to do, and she cried and said that she doesn\u2019t want to chose. I think if anything she is the one who took it to that place, all I wanted was to discuss what we could do", "He\u2026 doesnt know them, hence trying to have a conversation with his gf, who refused to even discuss anything.", "I personally thought it came across that other things had been tried, but it\u2019s difficult to try things when I don\u2019t specifically know what to try as I\u2019ve never had a cat like this. It\u2019s a discussion that needs to be had, that I\u2019m being stone walled on.", "Yeah I think that\u2019s a fair point. One I hadn\u2019t really thought about, but I feel if I mentioned that right now that would not go down to well. Thanks for your insight though", "It doesnt mean they *are* - but hey, if your child was behaving inappropriately you\u2019d talk to your partner about getting them help sooo\u2026", "I can't have children. I would never put a pet and a child in the same category. Some people might but using infertility as a barometer for that is dumb.", "If you don't have/don't want/can't have children, then you don't really know the difference. The pet certainly can fill some of the emotional roles of a child, the same way as other things that get called \"my baby\"--i.e., a startup, a restored car, etc. \n\nBut although it is filling some of those roles, it is *not* the same. Because if you somehow/purposely or unexpectedly did acquire custody of a child and now had a child *and* a pet/dream car, etc., then you'd be an AH if you considered them equal.\n\nIf a child and a pet both need surgery and you only have the money for one and it's a hard choice, then that's messed up. \n\nIf your child is allergic to the pet and you aren't sure what to do about it, then that's messed up.", "Does your gf apologize or try to make things right in your other conflicts, or is the cat thing an exception?", "There's a place in the UK, the purple cat cafe you'll find them on the net, they have a home made climbing idea. Even something as simple as staggered shelfs could work, or a radiator bed hung over a door.", "Because he said \"options on keeping the cat\"  not \"strategies to mitigate this behavior.\"", ">AITA for asking my partner to consider our options on keeping her cat?\n\nThis is your title. **Options. On. Keeping. Her. Cat.**\n\nIf that's how you put it to her, I'm not surprised if she thinks that's what you want.  Lots of people have given you behavioral advise, and you say you'll look into it, but if you didn't want to get rid of the cat you'd have kept researching that yourself.", "But frankly, what other options does she have? Can u give an example of one or two other ways (options) to remedy this situation?", "Please read the TLDR and tell me again how I'm wrong.", "It does not. Edit in what you've tried.", "Ha, no I absolutely wouldn't mention it, especially now.  \n\nBut I truly believe if the cat were destroying a bunch of her shit, she'd be a lot more open to discussing stuff", "I think my SO is just trying to bury her head to a lot of the problems. I don\u2019t think she wants to believe that Luna is as bad as I feel we both know she is right now.", "Admittedly the title is misleading here, but thats why we also read the post.", "Personally? Not really on my own. I never owned a cat before this, and was hoping my SO would know more about what to do. I know she\u2019s in some cat groups on Facebook where they discuss a lot of stuff like this. I\u2019ve had a lot of good suggestions on here that I\u2019ve written down though, and hoping to try and engage in a conversation with my SO once I feel the time is right, it all seems pretty raw right now.", "\u2026 so you read the title and the tldr?

No suggestion from OP about anything they should try.  and it ends with this:\n\n>TLDR: Partners cat has become very mean, and picks and chooses when she uses the litter tray, and destroys household items.

Just go for it and grab something for the cat on ur own that is meant to solve the issue. Do that on ur own to show initiative and that u do care for other solutions. Even if it is just going and getting some cat nip! Pretty good way to make any cat ur instant friend with just a pinch of that! Good luck!", "I read the whole post.  There is not one suggestion of doing anything other than get rid of the cat.  He mentions one thing the vet suggested that didn't work and was too expensive.\n\nHis later posts are trying to soft-pedal it, because he doesn't like the judgement.  My point is, that whatever he says now, he didn't say to his girlfriend when he brought up the topic.

You both deserve it.", "The first thing that I think you should do is try and let go of the notion that Luna is doing things \"on purpose\" to upset you. There are a lot of misconceptions about cats, specifically about how they will do things out of spite, and while i can understand feeling that way because of the frustration, it isn't helpful or true. Cats \"act out\" when they are stressed and scared and sometimes just plain unhappy. Many negative behaviours are also boredom, attempts to fill their needs, or even just wanting attention. There are probably a lot of factors at play for why this is the case, and they are going to be specific to your cat and your situation. But everything your cat is doing is telling you /something/, they just aren't communicating in a way that people easily understand. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy answer here. There isn't a magic solution that will fix everything; it's going to take a lot of work and dedication. I second everyone that said to watch Jackson Galaxy and to try and find a behavioural expert. You need to find the root cause of her discomfort and address it; calming sprays and remedies can only help to an extent and won't solve things.
