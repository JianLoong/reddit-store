Maybe you\u2019d like your own space too but you all don\u2019t live in a mansion. Why do you have to sacrifice so he can have a man cave?  I would turn that room into a shared space, that was the agreement. If he is not willing to compromise I might have to seriously reevaluate the relationship.", "NTA.  \n\n\nWhen my husband and I bought our first house it was 3br.  Master bedroom, 1br for his son (50/50 custody) and he insisted on the 3rd bedroom being his man cave/gaming space under the argument that I would have the rest of the house.  I wasn't happy about it, but gave in because the downpayment for the house was coming from his inheritance.  \n\n\nWe mostly had a good marriage. We loved each other, took care of each other, etc. But this is an example of how one issue can cause a divide over time that might prove impossible to come back from.    \n\n\nFrom the very first - his claim of me having \"the rest of the house\" was just patently untrue. I had to compromise on space, decor, use and I just kept compromising and compromising until very little of the house felt like it was really mine.  \n\n\nOver the course of the 10 years we were in the house, he gradually stopped using \"his\" room and hung out in the living room all the time - making that even less \"my\" space.  For Christmas 2020, I spent 2 weeks hard labor cleaning up and reorganizing \"his\" room to make it more comfortable and relaxing in the hopes he would want to start spending more time in there.  One of the big reasons he said he never used it anymore was because his computer didn't work and he never would pull the trigger on upgrading it when we had the money to do so.  So I got together with my parents and bought him a new, not amazing but upgradeable, computer for Christmas as well.   \n\n\nThis was during the lockdown times so I had been working at home on an uncomfortable built-in desk in the kitchen.  Since \"his\" room was a good sized bedroom, I sectioned off a corner to put up a small desk where I could move my work computer.  He worked outside the home in essential services, so we would never be using the room at the same time.  I did not change ANY of the decor.  Somehow - this made the room not feel like \"his\" so he literally never used it again.  It sat empty for the next almost year until he passed away unexpectedly.  \n\n\nIt was just a room -- but over time it became a lot more. I wish I had expressed my feelings more openly to begin with. I wish he had been able to explain WHY this was so important to him so maybe we could have found a compromise. But none of that happened and by the time of his death I had a TON of built up resentment over this damn room. To the point where I'm not sure our marriage would have lasted if we didn't solve that issue.  \n\n\nMy point to OP - you are very early in this living together thing. Get to the bottom of his unwillingness to fully share space or you may be opening a chasm that will just get deeper and deeper and deeper.  Good luck!", "From what you have said ESH\n\nHe should stick to the agreement you made about the second room.  You don't mention what he has in there so can't comment on why he doesn't want to clear it but i will assume he doesn't need all that space for his work.\n\nOn the other hand at 1am you can move to the couch to do your school work.  If it was 9pm i could understand why you wouldn't want to turn out the light but I don't think its unreasonable to expect to be able to go to bed in the early hours of the morning especially if you have work the following day.\n\nINFO:  Who's apartment is it and what is his 'personal space' used for and why can't he change it?", "NTA. Bc is being selfish, unreasonable and a quite a twatapottomas", "NTA you moved in with the agreement it would be a shared office after moving in he changed his mind meaning the only place for you to use is the master bedroom he created the issue and it has a simple fix", "NTA. He needs an entire space to himself, yet you can\u2019t complete schoolwork in the only space allotted to you? Which happens to be the bedroom. Which was HIS idea.\n\nHe painted himself into a corner, and if the light being on bothers him, he should either pony up some shared office space, or invest in a sleep mask and ear plugs.", "YTBH. Yea, he probably should fix up that room and make it into an office for you, but telling him to sleep on the couch was petty in my opinion. I would suggest looking into getting a cheap laptop to do your homework on instead; that way, you can have a little office wherever you go. The bedroom is honestly for sleeping, so he was right to want to sleep there. It's not like the bedroom is just for you; he owns part of it as well. It's easy to repay evil for evil, but it takes courage to turn the other cheek and do the right thing.\n\n**2.\rVoting Rules**\r  \nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion.

You can decorate how you want it to be and curate your own spaces.\n\n\nThat way you both get your own room and private space and choose when you want to share space.", "NTA your boyfriend has taken an entire room to himself then also expects you to work around his schedule ummm no\n\nIf i was in your shoes while he is out i would move what ever you could out of the room into maybe a corner of the living room and move your desk in, when he complians just say you were tired of waiting for him to help so you did it yourself", "NTA", "He can\u2019t have his own space and then kick you out of your established space. He needs to suck it up and let you move into the office", "NTA it sounds like your bf needs to get something like a futon couch instead of a loveseat in his office if he wants your workspace to be in the bedroom. You already compromised by giving up your share of the office, its his turn. He can either deal with the fact that he sleeps in your workspace or find another place to sleep.", "NTA. My and my partner are in the process of moving to a 2 bed house from a 1 bed flat. We have agreed that the 2nd bedroom will be space for his crap (as I like to call it!) that won't go in the main areas of the house and also his desk as he's a photographer so edits a lot. But I will also be able to use it as I WFH 2 days a week. It's primarily his room, but we both pay rent so should both have access to it when needed.\n\nHe needs to learn how to share, he is not a child.", "NTA. He's the reason things are set up this way. He should get a couch or air mattress for his office that he refuses to share with you.", "NTA. You had an agreement for the other room to be an office for both of you, and hes being a baby about it and being selfish.", "NTA. But why can't you clean it out? Sounds like a petty thing to argue about when the solution takes an hr to fix", "If they are renting the place, I sincerely hope he pays a bigger portion of the rent since he's taken over one whole room for himself that OP isn't allowed to use, while OP has no such space for themself.", "NTA he changed the arrangements. Why are you allowing it?", "NTA - your bf gets his own space, but you\u2019re not entitled to the same? Expect more of this in the future if you don\u2019t address it.  He can\u2019t make the decision on his own. Move into the office - it\u2019s just as much your space.", "NTA. He reneged on your agreement and decided his wants mattered more than your needs. He\u2019s being incredibly selfish and inconsiderate. Glad he\u2019s just a boyfriend.", "Nta the plan was for a shared office. He doesn't want that?  Then he gets to deal with the natural consequences.\n\nIf you're splitting the rent he needs to be paying a higher percentage since one room is ENTIRELY his.", "NTA. If it's that important to him, maybe he should let you use the office.", "NTA and this is worryingly unfair \n\nI hope you also pay less rent since you do not have your own space. \n\nInsist the office is shared.", "ESH, neither of you seem ready for a mature live in relationship", "Yta", "NTA. School comes before sleep and \u201chis space\u201d \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "WTF? \n\nMove your stuff into the office today. Tell him you like having your own space too. He can store his stuff in the closet.", "NTA. He made this situation. It\u2019s not your fault he has to live with the consequences.", "I think you hit the nail on the head. \n\nNTA. \n\nWhile you were a little rude in the moment, he didn't really give you an alternative.  You wanted your office to be in the office room, not the bedroom for specifically this reason.  He stopped that plan and now he's seeing the consequences of his choices.", "He needs his space\u2026so tell him to put a bigger couch or bed in there so he isn\u2019t inconvenienced by you working late. NTA. He cannot have it both ways", "NTA. He insisted on his own space, so he can sleep in it.", "He wouldn't budge, so neither will you. NTA. He's making and enforcing the rules under your shared roof. Do not let him. He's got your convenience and comfort to consider as well.", "NTA. What exactly is his logic for how that\u2019s NOT his fault?? You\u2019ve repeatedly asked him to move his stuff so you can put your desk in there. He\u2019s refused because he \u201clikes his space.\u201d Um, what about YOUR space? Why does he get a whole separate room for himself in addition to your shared bedroom, AND think he gets to make all the rules in the shared bedroom? \n\nHow are you splitting the rent? Cause if he keeps refusing to share that second bedroom you need to rework the arrangement to account for the fact that he\u2019s taken over full use of a room you originally agreed to share.", "NTA, so you have to differ from you work because he wants to go to sleep but cant share the extra room with you because he like his own space no.  oh well he can just sulk all he wants he made his couch he can lie in it. Pun intended", "Get out of this situation. You are so NTA. What really bothers me is that even after a full day to reflect on your argument, he stood his ground. He\u2019s very selfish. You can do better. Alone is better than being treated like this.", "he wants to have his cake and eat it too.  NTA", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason the other bedroom can't be set up as an office for both of you.", "NTA. Get BF an eye mask.", "I would say Y T A except it sounds like he wouldn't let you work in the supposedly shared office. Sure it's a dick move to prevent him from sleeping in your shared bedroom like that but he can't have it both ways. NTA", "Going against the apparent grain, but ESH.\n\nHe shouldn't have gone back on the plan for the 2nd bedroom to be an office for both of you, but at the same time you working up until (and past) 1am, in your shared bedroom, when he has to get up for work is not sustainable.", "You were a bit of an ass about it but really you didn\u2019t have a choice so NTA it\u2019s his own fault but I can see his side and why he\u2019s upset(even if it\u2019s wrong to be)", "How do you split the rent? 50/50? If so you should each get 1 bedroom. Hopefully the bathroom isnt an ensuite.  That way when your schedules dont align you have your own space. You also have the advantage of having one organized space because your bf sounds messy", "ESH.\n\nBedrooms are for sleeping; every other use is secondary.", "NTA. The discomfort of sleeping with a light on or on the couch is your boyfriend\u2019s asshole tax.", "NTA.\n\nYou are living together. You need to be able to make space for each other", "Exactly. The fact that he\u2019s more invested in having a clutter room for his stuff than a space for you to do your schoolwork makes me question how much he prioritizes you and your needs in general. The fact that he doesn\u2019t cheerfully sleep on the couch or with an eye mask knowing you can\u2019t work elsewhere (and everyone knows students have big deadlines) makes me think he\u2019s an asshole.", "If the boyfriend likes his space so much, then it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to go sleep in his extra room\u2026 right?", "This is such a good message - don't let resentments pile up. We're taught to \"just deal with it\", but all it means is that we let things fester. And it's twice as bad when we give something up to keep the peace, and then the other person doesn't even want the thing we gave up. \n\nAnd I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Thank you. My biggest regret is not getting the time to fix things - because I think we could have if we had tried. So I don't want other people to miss that opportunity.", "NTA.  BF is though.  BF also sounds rather selfish and entitled.\n\nHope OP is seeing the red flags here.", "NTA.  There's a designated office, if BF would get off his ass and clean it up this could have been avoided to start with.  If your work space was in the living room would BF have turned off the tv so you could have peace & quiet to work?  He's got the office to himself, seems like he has control of the living room, you weren't bothering him in the bedroom until he decided to come in and bother you.  From this limited post, I'd wonder if he really wanted to live with you.", "NTA at all", "NTA", "NTA, but also INFO: are y\u2019all splitting rent equally? Why does he get to go back on his word and take away your promised office space? He seems like an awfully selfish person to have to live with.", "Ditch the loser.", "NTAhe decided to change your agreement maybe he should put a bed in \"his\" space.", "Just FYI... I am six foot three and big, and I love sleeping on love seats. So, unless your guy is a literal giant, a love seat is not too small for somebody that does not want to sleep on the floor.", "Nta. He needs to share the office then", "NTA you offered him a solution. He didn't like it. He backed out of the original plan to share the room.", "NTA and your comment wasn\u2019t unnecessary... it was a FACT. He has now suffered the consequences of his actions.", "NTA, it *is* his fault lol", "Some people only like the options where somebody else has to change \ud83d\ude44", "I think op has a desktop.", "This. OP, if you're both paying equal rent, I'd sit down with your partner and agree on an adjusted rate, since he has a room all to himself. OR, he can learn to share like a big boy!", "When my husband died I went to a grief counseller which didn\u2019t help at the time but I don\u2019t think anything does. She told me that guilt is a pointless emotion and regret is only a different more destructive kind of guilt and is equally pointless. I wanted to scream at her. The smart thing she told me was don\u2019t let anyone tell you how to grieve. \n\nYears later I met a woman who when we got to talking had nearly the exact same but opposite regret. She had made the other decision and had done the thing that I was regretting not doing. \n\nWe keep in touch because in that moment we cancelled out each others biggest regret. I hope you find your Diane. \n\nOP WaterWitch is giving you good advice."]}
