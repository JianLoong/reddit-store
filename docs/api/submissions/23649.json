We both work full-time so he is in daycare 5-days a week.  If my wife and I ever have plans that require us to get a babysitter, we have a few options.  My parents are both retired and live a little over an hour away, so they can help either short or longer term.  We also have a few trusted babysitters that we use for date nights or shorter events.  And my MIL is also available to help, but I have some issues with that.\n\nMIL doesn't work so she's usually available.  But she is currently separated from her husband (wife's step-dad) and isn't living at home, she's bouncing around from family member to family member, pretty much couch surfing.  She also doesn't drive so anytime we want her to babysit it can be a hassle to work out traveling as some of the relatives she stays with live up to 4 hours away.  \n\nRecently, my wife and I attended a wedding of one of my wife's friends about 3 hours from where we live.  I wanted to make it a day trip and come home that night, but my wife hadn't seen a lot of this friend group in a while and wanted to make it a full weekend to catch up with people.  I agreed depending on whether or not my parents would be able to watch our son.  \n\nMy parents were busy moving that weekend (they just finished their retirement home) and none of us thought that them watching our son while that was going on would be a good idea. I again suggested just a day trip to the wedding, but my wife wanted her mom to babysit so she could catch up with her friends.  She assured me it would be fine and it was \"just a couple of nights.\"\n\nAt the wedding, my MIL called my wife during the ceremony but my wife didn't answer and called her back.  MIL had apparently tried to take our son to the county library which is about 6 miles from our house.  She thought it was too far to walk, so she tried to take the bus.  She ended up getting lost and didn't know where she was or how to get back home.  \n\nIt was a whole ordeal with my wife and I trying to get her on the right bus, or as I suggested, download Uber and take one home.  It took about 2 hours on the phone before we finally figured it out.  After we made sure they were home safe, my mood was not good.  I was upset and not exactly in a \"let's party at a wedding\" kind of headspace.  \n\nMy wife picked up on that and asked me what was wrong.  I told her this type of thing is exactly why I don't like her mom babysitting because she doesn't drive and this could have ended a lot worse than it did.  My wife said that I am blowing it out of proportion and that nothing bad happened.  She said if I'm going to ruin her time with her friends, I should just go back to the hotel, so that's what I did.  \n\nI guess she thought I wouldn't actually do that, and she got mad at me for ditching her at the reception.  I just needed to cool down and I didn't want to fight with her about her mom while at a wedding.

Your MIL went \"I'm lost\" and her only solution was to call her child. Not- I have this handy dandy phone, how can I use it to get my grandchild and I home.\n\nMy problem isn't that she got lost. My problem is that when she got lost, she couldn't problem solve on her own. And I admit that would make me question her a baby sitter. \n\nThings are going to go wrong when you are watching kids.

That bus could have dropped them off in a bad part of town. Now, I can't really say your MIL is an AH, per se, as I don't believe she had an malice. She was just being dumb.\n\nWhat I'm more concerned with is how your wife reacted. You both spent two hours out of your time trying to walk your MIL through to get on the right bus, which I can believe is an ordeal. And your wife's reaction is to be more concerned about partying with her friends while you're clearly distraut over the whole situation. And not only that, she tells you to go back to the hotel so you don't ruin her fun, then gets upset when you do that same exact thing.\n\nYour wife has her priorities messed up. You, her partner, are clearly upset about the whole thing and your night is ruined. But instead of comforting you, she berates you and is upset that you're, \"ruining her night with her friends.\" I hope she's a good mother and this is just a small hiccup.", "That her mother, an adult, couldn\u2019t solve the \u201cI tried to get to the library with the baby but now I\u2019m lost\u201d problem and had to call two *other* adults who were hours away to help her for over *two hours* makes her a dangerous babysitter.\n\nMinimally she could have asked for help, found a cab, called someone who lives closer etc.\n\nHer mother is not an appropriate babysitter because she can\u2019t adult with a baby. The end.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nI can totally understand your feelings, especially because you were far away from them and didnt know what could have happened.\nYour MIL should have searched for bus routes and planned what to do before trying to take one to go to the library, if she wasnt familiar with them. Or ask the bus drivers if she was taking the right ones.\nBut honestly, I'm more mad about your wife's reaction. You took 2 hours to be able to help your MIL to reach home, and her only concerns was to keep having fun with her friends at the wedding?\nI hope this is just a one-time thing and she's a good mother to your son. But I'll have a talk with her about everything, because even if nothing happend this time, doesnt mean you can dismiss the problem.", "NTA\n\nI don't think I trust your MIL with herself, much less a kid", "NTA your wife is delusional. The problem is not the lack of driving by the MIL. The problem is that she does not know how to get around, or resolve an emergency situation. By understanding buses or using uber e.g. You are right, wife is wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL had a whole computer in her hand and didn't have the problem solving skills to use it. If I was on the phone for 2 hours trying to help a grown adult navigate, I'd be mad as well.", "NTA. That your wife was utterly dismissive of the WHAT COULD have happened is what makes this so incredibly dangerous. Yes, nothing happened THIS TIME. But this time, it took 2 hours for 2 adults who were HOURS away to get MIL and VERY YOUNG son home. THIS TIME. Your wife needs to understand that next time...next time could mean something happens to MIL or  SON.", "NTA - how\u2019s your MIL with tech? Does she know how to use Google Maps? Or does she use WhatsApp? I know you can share location via WhatsApp.", "NTA. Sure, it ended fine, but it sounds incredibly stressful. She doesn't drive AND doesn't know how to navigate the bus system? I get not having your area of town memorized, but not being able to use the bus map/schedule? Oof. I used to spend summers with my grandmother, and we travelled all over on the bus running errands and adventuring \u2014 decades before apps or even personal cell phones were a thing.", " NTA\n\nGetting lost happens, not knowing how to get out if concerns me greatly.", "NAH. You seem to have a lot of resentment toward your MIL. I'm not sure if it's because she's not staying with her ex, because she doesn't drive, or because of something else. Getting lost in a town you don't live in is not uncommon. She called rather than ask strangers for support probably to avoid alerting anyone that she might be vulnerable, but she definitely could have gotten on Google maps or asked the bus driver to take her to the library directly or to help get her where she needed to go. She should have made sure she knew where she was going before getting on the bus, but she doesn't sound malicious, dangerous, or unhinged. Show her how to user uber and/or google maps and set some expectations around what you need and will allow while she's babysitting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One thing is if we talk about her health or emergencies, but your main problem is more from a financial point of view right?\nBecause if your 'I don't want to end up in a position where we are stuck caring for MIL for the rest of her life' is also on the health aspects, I can't really be on your side fully. If it's about finances yes, it's up to her to have a plan for her old age, especially if she is not retired and can work. Otherwise, she should ask her husband for help regarding financial support.\n\nSo, talk to your wife. Now her mother is still healthy, so you have the time to discuss and be on the same page. And maybe, to be fair, do the same talking about your parents too..Otherwise, one day you can be blindsided and dont have time to plan.", "I disagree. You don't have to live in a warzone for something to happen. Accidents happen all the time. Drunk drivers. Crime is a thing regardless of where you live. In some places the buses stop running at certain times. What would have happened if MIL phone battery had died, and she had no other way to contact her daughter? In today's day, most ppl are skeptical about letting others use their phones. And depending on where OP lives, the weather is also a factor right now. So many What IFs."]}
