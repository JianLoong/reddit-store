If roomie was really devious she\u2019d be filling it with water to cover her tracks. I used to do this with my parent\u2019s booze.", "INFO - why didn't you bring the face wash with you on your vacation? Or did you take a smaller travel container of it?", "Thief AND a liar, don't forget that second part.", "It would be one thing if you were going around weight the ketchup bottle and demanding to be paid back or something. But this is expensive facewash, and she's getting to use it for free. Like Poppy here said, she's just mad she was caught in a lie. \n\nPersonally, I'd start locking all of my toiletries in my room from now on. NTA", ">says normal people wouldn't do that,\n\nYea, normal people wouldn't steal her stuff either.", "Hey that\u2019s not fair. She\u2019s also a liar.", "This. She absolutely knows that it is a big deal or she would not have lied about it. NTA", "If it\u2019s nbd, then why tf isn\u2019t she using her own???  Oh and NTA", "An ounce is a LOT to use up too, that's full size for some skincare products.", "Bet it would be a big deal if the situation was reversed.", "Exactly. And since she thinks using it is no big deal she should be buying a new bottle of it for everyone to use. And she should continue to do so until she moves out. Because it\u2019s no big deal, right?", ">normal skincare products for the face cost an arm and a leg\n\nDang! What do skincare products for arms & legs cost? A torso?", "\"Angry people are not always wise.\" \n\nSeems to me that roommate thought she'd planned the perfect theft and so wasn't mentally prepared to be found out and so fell back on anger and victim blaming", "[removed]", "Haha then I might be an AH. I really wasn't trying to \"get her.\" I just wanted the issue put to bed.", "I really can't wrap my head around what you are saying, so getting proof before accusing someone of using your possessions is wrong and considered not normal? And when confronted the roommate denied and only confessed because op had the proof.", "Lol all the redditors with no social skills downvoting you.", "I think moving out seems more fun than locking my stuff in my room. Our lease is up soon anyway.", "Are you a professional thief? Haha. The point was just to get to the bottom of her gaslighting. I don't think it's the first time she's gaslit me. Now I'm just gonna move out since our lease is up soon.", "Yup. Bring it to your bedroom or keep it somewhere locked up when you're not using it. NTA.", "Yup, I had to do this with my husband and my shampoo and face wash. When you buy expensive things and someone uses it without replacing it or is willing to pay for it then it's an issue.\nAnother option for this is to pretty much tell her that she needs to start paying for half the bottle if she's going to be using it like you are.", "I think at this point I'll just move out and move in with my girlfriend. We've been wanting to move in together for a while anyway.", "Exactly, she could have apologized when you initially confronted her, said she hadn't realized it mattered, and agreed never to do it again. \n\nInstead she went with lying, and most assuredly intended to keep using it, figuring as OP said that opaque bottle means can't prove anything.", "Actually try swapping out your wash for ketchup, beat her at her game", "hey fellow jane austen fan!", "/u/AstronomerForsaken49 is a bot that stole part of a comment from /u/Kaila82 here /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk4dlg/aita_for_weighing_my_face_wash_bottle_to_catch_my/izyaztk/", "So you left it within her reach for the sole purpose of catching her using it? That seems weird. I\u2019m sorry, I was on your side until this comment. Either keep your special products out of common areas, share, or leave her with a decoy product to avoid the conflict. Roommates dynamics are hard enough without these games.", "Listen, the roommate is mad because you caught her. Look at her behavior with more detail, she was put in a embarrassing position because she stole from you and you caught her, she can't lie anymore, so instead of just apologizing she resorts to minimize the situation by saying \"it's a normal thing to do and you should just accept it\" and they are calling you names because they want to paint you as the villain and make you apologize and free her of the blame.", "You're nta, but it's strange and kind of aggressive to weigh it before even having a conversation about it.", "A portable shower caddy would be super helpful for OP right now.", "I had to do this with my ingrown hair serum! My BF kept using it on his face, which is fine except its almost $50 for about 8 oz!", "This is the way.", "Hey!  Fancy meeting you here! \ud83d\ude04", "Uhhhh I mean yeah it is a pain to have to carry it every time. I personally would likely forget half the time only remembering once the shower turned on and I was wet. So OP decided to make sure that someone else was actually using it before doing something like that. And truly OP shouldn\u2019t have to worry about her roommate stealing her expensive face wash.", "I get that it\u2019s a pain to move it back & forth but OP should have at least moved it for the trip. I can\u2019t believe she just left it.\n\nNTA but OP needs to protect her stuff knowing she lives with a thief", "Fair enough. That's why I'm crowdsourcing Reddit for a judgement. I was never looking for a \"gotcha\" moment. I wanted to put the issue to bed. When I caught her, I also asked (very nicely) her to avoid using it, I didn't mention weighing it. I just said I'd noticed mine was disappearing faster than usual and to make sure she wasn't using mine. Then she lied to my face. If I didn't weigh it I would never have caught on to her gaslighting. But thanks for the advice, next time I will try to push the issue a little harder upfront before going extreme and weighing it lol.", "This point of view makes no sense at all. You're basically saying 'how dare you try to prove that someone was stealing from you'. OP has every right to do so as long as there's no physical harm involved, and there wasn't.", "Found the thief", "She's nta, but she is weirdly passive aggressive when she could have had a conversation BEFORE she decided to weigh it to prove her point. Weighing it before the conversation comes off as pretty aggressive.", "By what you told us, I believe the roommate may have exaggerated the story when telling to other, maybe saying stuff like you weighted every day or making up other instance of you showing controlling behavior. I would advise hear from the roommates what she told them and explain your version to clear any doubts before she turns the others against you.", "Try stridex pads (salicylic acid). Someone tipped me off to them for ingrown hairs and it works really well.", "I buy face moisturizer that is $40 for a small container and the man doesn't know how to use sparingly. A little goes a long way but he slathers", "I didn\u2019t know this existed, thank you", "If this just a question of property rights, sure OP has done nothing wrong, but I\u2019ve never had a roommate dynamic free of differing assumptions about which products should be communal and which should be shared. The low conflict way to observe your property rights when there\u2019s not an immediate meeting of the minds is to remove the item in contention - or at least that was my preferred method. Another roommate I had put out decoy snacks, somewhat comically, as an olive branch while removing the snacks she wasn\u2019t willing to share. I\u2019m not that much of a people pleaser but to each their own. OP\u2019s approach seems pro-conflict. I just don\u2019t see the point in allowing this to unfold.", "My husband uses SO MUCH product in the shower. I had waist length hair and was using 1/2 of what he uses for his short hair. I have had so many talks and finally put it away after every shower.", "Seriously though...does no one teach guys how to use lotion or something? My older brother started getting into skincare and I had to teach him that he probably hated lotion and felt \"slimy\" after putting it on because he was using way too much.", "I rarely check bags", "You get a carry-on *and* a personal item (bag) with many airlines. I'm 40 and have never checked a bag. \n\nFrom the rest of your comment, you might want to deal with your boundary issues.", "Me too. I\u2019ve never worried about someone helping themselves to my hygiene products."]}
