Not to get mad at you for catching them.", "She thinks 'using a little face wash is normal and 'no big deal'?  LOL, she must be rich - normal skincare products for the face cost an arm and a leg, and have to be budgeted for.  Also, she wouldn't have denied it if she thought it was no big deal.", "NTA It's your bottle. It's not psycho or controlling when she had no right to use it. You couldn't overstep any boundary here since only yours was crossed. \n\nShe is only reacting that way because she has been caught red handed.", "NTA.  She's mad she got caught.

Moreover, it's your stuff, you can do whatever the hell you want with it: weight it, explode it, send it to Mars. The only reason your roommate cares what you are doing to this bottle, is because you exposed her lying and stealing. So now, she's trying to gaslight you to make you believe your behavior is the problem, not her stealing.", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s not normal to steal expensive products from your roommates.

That is your stuff, not only should she not be using it, she certainly shouldn't be lying about it when caught. If she had just grabbed yours once or twice, fine, but like you said, she is using it on a mostly daily basis, so it is no accident. \n\nDo not apologize. Trust me your roommates know that what you did was fine. We have all had a roommate or coworker that was taking our stuff, and we all wanted to catch them in the act. Your approach was the least intrusive option- no camera, no fake product, no putting dye in the bottle to catch her literally red in the face- you just weighed your own items. \n\nSo now you text her- using your face wash and other personal items IS a big deal to you, so you expect her to leave your items alone going forward.

I suggest keeping your facewash in your room until she moves out. If she says anything else about you being the asshole reminder that stealing is the asshole move. She is essentially stealing money from you because the facewash is expensive. No one would question the validity of your actions if we were talking about cash directly.", "NTA... Like you I have very sensitive skin minus the acne but plus eczema. I have always been very particular at what I put not only on my face but my entire body.

They shouldn't be using your stuff, end of discussion. \n\nYou're not crazy for weighing your own things. They're manipulative.

Roommates who use your shit without asking are the worst. I just got done going through that and it's such a pet peeve of mine, especially when they deny it when confronted about it. The fact that some people have to be reminded not to use other people's things (unless they've been told it's okay) suck. She's definitely TA and she's the one who overstepped her boundaries by using it without asking, and without offering any compensation (like throwing you $10 or something) or apology.", "NTA - your personal belongings are a boundary, and it's clear she's just playing damage control now. Normal people ask before using things, or at least apologize and recognize when they did the wrong thing. There's nothing to apologize for here, but I hope your other roommates are understanding towards your case", "Absolutely NTA. She got caught, that's why she is angry. You not only caught her stealing but also lying about it and you have proof. Do you really wonder why she tries to turn this thing around and make you the bad guy of the story and paint her as the victim? It is her only chance to get out with minimal damage to her image.
