I made a standing rib roast, also known as prime rib. I love prime rib but rarely get to eat it because most restaurants don't have it on their menu, so I was particularly excited about this. I also made goat cheese mashed potatoes upon my friend's recommendation. My husband hates goat cheese and he also only likes filet mignon, so I made him plain mashed potatoes and cooked a filet.\n\nWhen I was finishing up the meal and my family had already shown up, I was trying to reheat my husband's mashed potatoes (I had made them earlier and put them in the fridge) and cook his steak. I got very overwhelmed with everything going on and I told him his steak probably wasn't going to be as done as he likes it and he may have to heat up his mashed potatoes a little more. To clarify, he did not help me with ANY of the cooking. He did clean up the house, which I appreciated, but he did not have anything to do with the preparation of the food or helping whatsoever. \n\nDinner was a hit. My whole family loved it and raved about how good it was. After everyone left, my husband told me that he felt like I didn't put enough effort into his meal. I was shocked that he would say this because I went out of my way to make something I thought he would like, I just got overwhelmed at the last minute and didn't get it how he liked it. The way I see it, he could've taken over finishing up his food or sucked it up and ate what everyone else was eating. But, he decided to just complain instead. \n\nAgain, this was two years ago. When it was brought up tonight, he told me that I was selfish, that I should care more about accommodating my husband, and this was very unattractive to him that I didn't want to make him a separate meal, and that I should be prioritizing his preferences over the guests in our house.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for not putting enough effort into my husband's dinner?", "created_utc": 1698619803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jex57/aita_for_not_putting_enough_effort_into_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
