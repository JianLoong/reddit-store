He only has one sister (22F) who I don't have a close relationship with due to my personal problems with her entitlement.\n\nMy SIL is graduating from college next summer and has been looking for a job. Both she and my MIL turned to me to ask if I could help her since I worked in the same field she's interested in. After my own graduation, I worked for two years at a top investment banking firm and made many close connections\u2014most of whom I introduced my SIL to. I went out of my way to ask one of my close friends who's still working at my old firm for open opportunities on his team. My SIL lucked out because my friend just so happened to have an entry-level position open on his team, so he had her apply and they officially gave her an offer right before Thanksgiving. She was ecstatic about it and immediately went on LinkedIn bragging about her new offer, but ironically, she took a full week after her offer was given to write me a 'thank you' email.\n\nAt Thanksgiving three weeks ago, we were all chatting after dinner and my MIL said  \"I'm just so glad that SIL got that offer\" and then turned to me and thanked me for my help. My SIL then proceeded to say \"Yes, I'm glad but I'd rather marry rich like you did with my brother and just live the sweet life of a gold digger\" and then laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world. I was shocked that she said that, even if it was intended as a joke, especially given how much I've helped her. My husband immediately came to my defense and said \"That's a horrible thing to say, you know that \\[X\\] actually supported *me* financially when I was doing my PhD.\" My SIL proceeded to then double down and say \"Yeah, but she's not doing anything now and just living off your money...\" At this point, my MIL interjected and told her she was being rude and needed to apologize, which she begrudgingly did. After the whole fiasco, my husband was livid with his sister and my MIL apologized to me privately.\n\nHer statement bothered me tremendously as it really hurt to be viewed that way. In fact, she knows that I worked my ass off supporting my husband until he got his dream job. Then I went to law school and worked as an attorney making 250k/year\u2014all of which is still being used in our joint savings. My husband makes a very comfortable salary now and encouraged me to stop working last year.\n\nHer entitled comments made me reconsider the offer I extended to her. After a week, I decided to tell my friend about what happened and he was livid for me and said that he did not want anyone like that on his team. I agreed with him and he rescinded her offer this past week. My SIL was devastated and so was my MIL, but neither one of them know it was because of me. My husband knows I did it and he actually has been very supportive of my decision. However, it's my own conscience that's making me feel guilty.

So let's think about what you would say:\n\n\"SIL's comments to me were extremely hurtful. But they were also spectacularly unprofessional. Saying--to the person who helped find the opportunity for you--that you don't really want the job because you would prefer to marry rich? It's bad for morale to have someone on the team who doesn't want to be there. Also, SIL was given an explicit refutation of her inappropriate comment and she *still* didn't apologize until her mother told her to... Even then, her apology was like that of a sullen teenager. In professional situations, you need to be able to read the room, respond appropriately to criticism, and apologize (without being prompted) for any comments that may have offended someone, especially when the comment was based on sexist stereotypes. Even if I hadn't been the target of her attack, I would have had to rescind my recommendation and let my colleague know why.\"\n\nNTA. You are feeling guilty because you think that you are punishing her for hurting your feelings...but you aren't. If you were overreacting, her mother wouldn't have been so embarrassed by the behavior that she felt the need to offer her own apology, and your colleague wouldn't have been so quick to rescind the offer.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, he didn\u2019t rescind the offer because of you. He rescinded the offer because she didn\u2019t meet the company\u2019s moral code and culture that he wants to uphold for his team.\n\nBasically he is saving himself a headache down the road from someone with your SILs personality", "NTA - Your recommendation of her reflects on your own professional standing as well. You went to the person making the hiring decisions to let them know that your recommendation was rescinded, and they chose to revoke the offer. \n\nIf you had gone to them and demanded they do so, that would be a different story. Since you didn't, everything was entirely fair.", "NTA. I would have even told her I was the one that made the offer go away. She needs to learn. A+ husband you have for supporting you in the decision to rescind it. You also probably saved your friend the hassle of dealing with her as well as saving your reputation in that field. If you go to bat for someone\u2019s and they turn out to be bad in the job then it also reflects bad on you. So in a way you also helped yourself by getting that offer rescinded.", "NTA: this is a prime example of don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you. You should tell her to marry rich like you did so she can live the life of a gold digger", "The second she chose to call you a \u201cgold digger\u201d is the second she lost her spot.\n\n**Assholes of the world, if you\u2019re listening:**\n\nDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you. What someone generously gives to you can also *generously be taken away*.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If she's that crass and clueless to think what she said was appropriate and doesn't even have the decency to apologize on her own after being called on her shit, she is a huge liability for your friend and her bad behavior will reflect poorly on you.", "When you're hiring someone, you're hiring personality and character as much as technical skills. (This is especially true for entry level positions.) Your SIL failed the character test. NTA.", "NTA\n\nImagine what she would say about you behind your back.  I also wouldn't tell her, not yet anyway.  Unless you're prepared to be blamed for everything that goes wrong in her career.  Let her sort her life out and tell her in 15 years.", "NTA\n\nShe said that to your face\u2026who knows what she will say to your connections behind your back.", "NTA. You likely saved your true friend the hassle of dealing with her personality that would be toxic in a professional environment. If she\u2019s as well qualified as your friend initially thought she shouldn\u2019t have a problem finding work.", "NTA. Your connections got her a job. Your connections can take it away as well. She was ungrateful. Then she insulted you. Why should you saddle your contacts with such a person?", "Wow, that is an incredibly rude thing to say. If I talked her up to my connections I would 100% let them know that I no longer feel the same about her. NTA", "NTA and you should tell her. She\u2019s 22 not 11. Time to learn that your words can have consequences", "NTA. Sheeeeeeit, I'd have called my friend right there at the table and told her to yank the offer back. I bet you show her some teeth and she'll watch her yap around you in the future.", "NTA,  you don't insult people who help you out.", "NTA. F around and find out. You could say she found out huh", "NTA\nSIL reap what you sow, if she is able to cut it she will find her own connection and not take advantage of your kindness", "NTA. Atleast OP won't have professional ties to SIL. ( sounds like a real peach.)", "NTA Don't bite the hand that feeds you.", "NTA", "NTA\u2026I guess she should have been great full rather than having the audacity to attack the person helping her. She got what she deserves and can look for a job on her own. You don\u2019t pee on a match when your trying to start a fire.", "I\u2019d tell her. Maybe she\u2019d learn something. However, never, ever lift one finger to help her again as long as you live. NTA.", "I'll probably get slammed for this, but I think you're NTA. She F'd around and found out. Maybe she'll learn to not bite the hand that gets her a job.", "NTA - and a better way to have handled it might\u2019ve been to actually own up and explain why you rescinded the offer so she knows for the next time. You could\u2019ve also let her know that if her attitude changed after her next job, to come back and see you.", "NTA", "NTA. I would tell her it was me, Oleena Tyrell style.", "My judgement is based on your motivation.  No matter what SIL sucks.  Really badly.  Awkward not funny joke, ok.  Double down means it wasn\u2019t really a joke.\n\nWhen you actively help someone find a job, you are placing your own reputation on the line.  If you find cause to longer vouch for that person (you can\u2019t vouch for how she behave in that role and workplace), perfectly fair to rescind your endorsement.  In fact, IMHO it is necessary as her future actions in that role reflect back on you.  That is a pure motivation.  And I would be uncomfortable endorsing someone for the role in question given her behavior.\n\nBut.  If your motivation was solely spite and getting back it her, I would also label you the AH.  Your reaction would be out of proportion.\n\nI suspect it was a mix of the two which is just fine.", "NTA. She's got some nerve.", "NTA - as long as you don't tell them. If you let your \"guilty conscience\" lead you to to confessing and stirring up drama, then you would be TA.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your SIL is a 'mean girl'. \nNTA", "NTA. Don't bite the hand that feeds you and make sexist jokes about women in the work field you're trying to enter.", "NTA. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. \n\nYou put *your own reputation* on the line to find her a job. Any of her words or actions at that job would have reflected on you. Considering she made her comment in direct response to thanking you for your help and then *doubled down* after she was called out and corrected, it doesn't sound like she has a strong grasp on basic social norms. What do you think she would say the first time someone says \"oh, you're OP's SIL? I worked with OP years ago\"? Would she *repeat* the golddigger comment or some other insult to someone you know professionally? *You cannot trust that she wouldn't destroy both of you in her misguided attempt to bad mouth you*.\n\nShe is clearly either jealous or resents you for some reason. If she can't understand that her own behaviour to you is what lost her the job, you need to stay well away and let her find her own job.

You also put your name on the line to recommend her and she took that for granted.  It takes years to build up a good career & reputation, she doesn't get what work it takes.  She may never get it.   \n\n   And now, she can put in the effort and find out for herself what it takes to be a success.  I'd consider this a life lesson that she very much needed.  A person does not insult the very person who helps get them a job and a foot in the door to a good career.", "NTA You don't owe the SIL anything. Your close friend who initially offered the job chose to withdraw the offer. She could have been a bigger problem for him in the future. He was probably protecting himself from having to deal with an immature and rude employee.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t force your friend to rescind the offer.

You saved your friend countless headaches and money if she couldn\u2019t be professional.", "Brilliantly said.", "Great advice.", "Also, it is your reputation and your friends reputation that she is screwing with if she goes badly at this role. \n\nThe accusations of nepotism will fly!\n\nMost normal risk adverse people would back out of a professional offer than has a high risk of making them look professionally incompetent", "Perfectly said and I know in your situation I would much rather feel bad about causing SIL to lose the offer than to have to apologize to your old colleague for asking for a favor that could go very wrong for him!  I'm betting she wasn't the most qualified applicant for the job!  I think you would have been an AH if you didn't tell him.", ">her mother wouldn't have been so embarrassed... and your colleague wouldn't have been so quick to rescind the offer\n\nThis really is the crux of it, imo. Great job netting it out to this basic level", "If this is how she treats family, imagine what she could be like in a corporate setting..\n\nIf the friend vouched for SIL based on Ops recommendation and she got snotty with the wrong person on day, it could make him look bad.", "And it doesn't sound like she apologized to OP at all.", "Indeed.  In investment banking, there would likely be a lot of individuals SIL would come across who have money and do not need to work, and are clients directly or family of the investors.  How many would she offend, jeopardizing the business brought to the firm?"]}
