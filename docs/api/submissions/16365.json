Your poor brother. It's so beautiful that he picked you. Sucks that he was badly shamed for something so lovely", "You are NTA. You didnt do anything against the will of your brother nor did you break the assignment rules. You just tried to respect the wish of your sibling and help him out, in my opinion that doesnt make u an AH", "Info: How exactly was he dressing up as someone from another race?This whole scenario seems filtered down to imply innocence but the reactions suggest otherwise.", "NTA. It is very endearing your brother admires you, that\u2019s awesome, I hope you can continue to be a positive influence in his life. Did you have a slight lapse of judgement? Possibly. Are you an asshole, no. On borrowing your step moms stuff, I don\u2019t think she would have had as big of an issue if she wasn\u2019t against your brother using for his project in the first place, but next time, ask.", "NTA. Why would anyone think its helpful to bother a 13-year-old because he curled his hair?\nAdditionally, I think his teacher is taking political correctness way too far. He could have complained if he showed up in full-on blackface or something, but curled hair? Really?", "NTA. Your step mother and your brother's teacher overreacted. Take it in your stride knowing that you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. It's adorable your half brother adores you this much. It has absolutely nothing to do with race. The only thing I can think of that could've been handled better was for you to ask if you could borrow the curling iron.", "NTA - Curling his hair and wearing your clothes is perfectly appropriate. And frankly, even if you (specifically you) had sent him in \"blackface\" I would still back you on this. There no mockery, no disrespect, and the fact that he chose you to emanate is bringing tears to my eyes. He looks up to you and that is valuable as heck!!\n\nI would personally go above the stepmonster and teacher and go speak with his principal. The teacher needs a dressing down by her superior because *in this particular case* it is the teacher whose response was inappropriate. Had she asked if you knew about this report, and heard you helped dress him, that makes it a completely different scenario. PLUS it was hair curling, so big friggan deal.\n\nAlso your stepmonster can shove off. This has absolutely nothing to do with you using a haircurler without permission and everything to do with race. Had she been a decent mom she would have looked at the situation, asked your brother questions, and went to the principal herself to argue against the teacher.\n\nAll these racist faux 'mean-well' people have done was tell your brother he shouldnt want to be like you. And especially considering the other people in his life, they could not be more wrong <3 Keep being an amazing sibling, help him stay strong against people like this, and dont be afraid to defend him when his own mother wont.\n\nHe did nothing wrong, and neither did you. Call the teacher out personally and then take it to her boss.", "NTA. Its an honor he chose you. The teacher is an AH though for implying he shouldn't admire someone from another race.", "NTA - Where an assignment is to dress up as someone else, to mimic a hairstyle in this way shouldn\u2019t be deemed as inappropriate. If your brother decided to curl his hair on his own accord outside of this assignment then that wouldn\u2019t be seen as inappropriate. \n\nHowever, a point on the use of curling irons on your brother. My mum refused to let me use any hair products like this until I was 16 (I thought slightly strict) but I had to respect that. It might have been worth to check that with your step-mom first if you could use them on your brother.", "NTA. The age of PC. You did nothing wrong", "Info: so, it's not explicitly stated. What is everyone's race in this situation?", "NTA.\n\nYour stepmom is a little AH. I get why she was annoyed. But she overreacted and she should have stood up for your brother when his teacher called.\n\nYour brother's teacher is a MASSIVE AH. I hate this political correctness that punishes and shames a young boy with GOOD intentions.\n\nDid this happen in California by any chance?", "isnt it the exact opposite of inappropriate to admire someone of another race? teachers nowadays suck...\n\nNTA\n\nedit: the concept of races and the special treats of those is ridiculous in its own rights. there is own race on this planets: humans. i wish we had different races.  drinking with dwarf or an orc sounds fun", "NTA and question why the teacher believes only a certain race is capable of having curly hair? That doesn't sound like an appropriate thing to be teaching children given it's factually incorrect.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm mixed south-Asian and white, and I have curly hair inherited from my very white father, and of course plenty of black folks have curly hair.", "Yeah and I would even say that her parents are NTA too. With the world the way it is, I don't blame them for being scared of what others may think.  PC culture is brutal and unforgiving.", "So true", "No he was her step-brother but he still did nothing wrong by dressing as his big sister", "NTA. Her reason is totally offbase. So as a white person I would not be able to dress as a black historical figure because I admire them? Imagine that the person I admire is President Obama. Would I have gotten the same negative comments?", "NTA. it\u2019s so cute that he wanted to dress up like you. they\u2019re TA for making it a gender issue instead of focusing on the purpose of the assignment", "NTA- I think it was incredibly sweet of him and what you did was also very nice.

She's just mad that the school called.", "Yes! Crappy teacher and parents!", "Could simply be that he passes for one race, then mentioned his sister is another race, and the teacher reacted from there. They could also have omitted, but there's a very decent chance it was entirely innocent.", "I am Celtic/Germanic and I have curly hair... and the point of the assignment was to dress up like someone you admired, but if that person is a different race you can't dress up like them or you can't admire someone of a different race?

It's not like you have him a perm.\n\nPeople need to take a child pill.  And the very fact that your brother chose you as someone he admires says volumes. That is very touching.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***\"My stepmom said I made them look like negligent parents...\"***\n\nSounds like your stepmom is a lot more concerned with appearances and how she looks,, rather than about either of you kids.

Your parents and that teacher are way wrong.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your brother sound awesome.\n\nThe teacher, your stepmom, and your dad all suck. Your dad should have your and your brother's back. He knew brother was dressing up like you, and the hair part isn't a big deal.\n\nEdit: also wtf with the race stipulation? There are (obviously) very admirable people of all races throughout history. But someone who isn't that race couldn't have chosen them for the assignment? That's crap. Shit, I almost think the assignment should require you to choose someone if a different race, just to broaden horizons.", "NTA and the way this assignment is apparently being managed it discourages white kids from admiring black people which probably isn't the intended outcome but is offputing as hell. Like this project is begging for a kid to show up in inappropriate cultural garb because they think Sitting Bull is cool as hell or something it's a bad idea that is based in a problematic assumption about who kids look up to.", "NTA and white people can have curly hair too, half the kids with curly hair in my school are white.", "A massive AH so big it has an echo", "In Ukraine they call the Russian soldiers Orcs.", "I assumed OP was mixed race and half-brother was white.", "WTH did I read? First, your brother is 13, girls at that age have been using curling irons for at least a year or two, so how the hell did you jeopardize his safety? Second, the assignment was literally to dress up as the person you admire. He didn't go to school in black face. All you did was curl his hair.

Your dad, stepmom, and the teacher are.", "NTA\n\nThis is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, my brother (who make white bread look spicy) is Caucasian and has for his entire life had one of the best curly haired afros I've ever seen. OP your brother looks up to you and just wanted to represent as accurately as possible, good job!", "NTA. I\u2019m questioning if the phone call actually happened, and your stepmom is using it as an \u201cI told you so,\u201d to go along with her narrative.", "NTA\n But can someone please go to his school and solve this?? \n\n\nTeacher needs to be taught a lesson or something. Ugh your poor brother. Please, if you can, go to his school with him and discuss with teacher or he might end up having long standing trauma from this.", "NTA", "So the scenario is: OP is mixed race. Father is white, mother black. Step mother is also white, which results in a half brother being white. That is how you have half brother who is not mixed race because both of HIS parents are the same race.", "NTA obviously but challenge them to their own game, demand to know why they aren't allowing students to look up to people of colour And why they are choosing if students work is appropriate based purely on race", "i would be so tempted to show up at the school like \u201chey wtf\u201d\n\nbut i suspect dad would not approve. nta, this is just cute i think", "This guy just won't give us an answer"]}
