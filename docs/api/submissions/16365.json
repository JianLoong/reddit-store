Your poor brother. It's so beautiful that he picked you. Sucks that he was badly shamed for something so lovely", "You are NTA. You didnt do anything against the will of your brother nor did you break the assignment rules. You just tried to respect the wish of your sibling and help him out, in my opinion that doesnt make u an AH", "Info: How exactly was he dressing up as someone from another race?This whole scenario seems filtered down to imply innocence but the reactions suggest otherwise.", "NTA. It is very endearing your brother admires you, that\u2019s awesome, I hope you can continue to be a positive influence in his life. Did you have a slight lapse of judgement? Possibly. Are you an asshole, no. On borrowing your step moms stuff, I don\u2019t think she would have had as big of an issue if she wasn\u2019t against your brother using for his project in the first place, but next time, ask.", "NTA. Why would anyone think its helpful to bother a 13-year-old because he curled his hair?\nAdditionally, I think his teacher is taking political correctness way too far. He could have complained if he showed up in full-on blackface or something, but curled hair? Really?", "NTA. Your step mother and your brother's teacher overreacted. Take it in your stride knowing that you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. It's adorable your half brother adores you this much. It has absolutely nothing to do with race. The only thing I can think of that could've been handled better was for you to ask if you could borrow the curling iron.", "NTA - Curling his hair and wearing your clothes is perfectly appropriate. And frankly, even if you (specifically you) had sent him in \"blackface\" I would still back you on this. There no mockery, no disrespect, and the fact that he chose you to emanate is bringing tears to my eyes. He looks up to you and that is valuable as heck!!\n\nI would personally go above the stepmonster and teacher and go speak with his principal. The teacher needs a dressing down by her superior because *in this particular case* it is the teacher whose response was inappropriate. Had she asked if you knew about this report, and heard you helped dress him, that makes it a completely different scenario. PLUS it was hair curling, so big friggan deal.\n\nAlso your stepmonster can shove off. This has absolutely nothing to do with you using a haircurler without permission and everything to do with race. Had she been a decent mom she would have looked at the situation, asked your brother questions, and went to the principal herself to argue against the teacher.\n\nAll these racist faux 'mean-well' people have done was tell your brother he shouldnt want to be like you. And especially considering the other people in his life, they could not be more wrong <3 Keep being an amazing sibling, help him stay strong against people like this, and dont be afraid to defend him when his own mother wont.\n\nHe did nothing wrong, and neither did you. Call the teacher out personally and then take it to her boss.", "NTA. Its an honor he chose you. The teacher is an AH though for implying he shouldn't admire someone from another race.", "NTA - Where an assignment is to dress up as someone else, to mimic a hairstyle in this way shouldn\u2019t be deemed as inappropriate. If your brother decided to curl his hair on his own accord outside of this assignment then that wouldn\u2019t be seen as inappropriate. \n\nHowever, a point on the use of curling irons on your brother. My mum refused to let me use any hair products like this until I was 16 (I thought slightly strict) but I had to respect that. It might have been worth to check that with your step-mom first if you could use them on your brother.", "NTA. The age of PC. You did nothing wrong", "Info: so, it's not explicitly stated. What is everyone's race in this situation?", "NTA.\n\nYour stepmom is a little AH. I get why she was annoyed. But she overreacted and she should have stood up for your brother when his teacher called.\n\nYour brother's teacher is a MASSIVE AH. I hate this political correctness that punishes and shames a young boy with GOOD intentions.\n\nDid this happen in California by any chance?", "isnt it the exact opposite of inappropriate to admire someone of another race? teachers nowadays suck...\n\nNTA", "NTA and question why the teacher believes only a certain race is capable of having curly hair? That doesn't sound like an appropriate thing to be teaching children given it's factually incorrect.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
