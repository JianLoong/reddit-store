I retired early when my youngest son (34m) completed his degree about 14 years ago.\n\nOur country currently has a housing crisis so my son and his wife rented when they started their marriage. When my wife and I noticed that we were dipping into our emergency fund and our savings was getting depleted, we asked our son and his wife to move in since the house is going to them when we pass anyway.\n\nThey both have stable jobs and my daughter-in-law has other side businesses that allow her to financially support her own parents as well. We belong to a culture where it's customary to take care of your parents when they get old.\n\nThey moved in and have been covering all expenses which helps us keep our savings intact. They pay for groceries, electricity, water, internet, our more expensive medications, and everything else around the house. They also paid for our annual property taxes. They also help around the house when they aren't working.\n\nOne thing I don't like is their style of living. They both work from home and they converted one of the spare rooms into an office and I hate how cluttered it can get when I walk past. I told my son that my daughter in law should spend extra time straightening up both their desks after work to keep the room organized.\n\nAt one point I walked past their bedroom while my son was walking out, so the door was ajar and I saw my daughter-in-law lounging on the bed, legs akimbo. I told my son it was unbecoming of a woman to behave like that. My son said she isn't like that in the living room but feels comfortable to lounge a bit freely in the privacy of their bedroom.\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law have been distant with me since, with my daughter-in-law barely speaking to me at all. My wife spoke to both of them to ask if they are okay and my daughter-in-law said she felt I was being misogynistic and that she didn't feel comfortable interacting with me anymore. She has also said to my wife that if she doesn't end up feeling better about this situation she will look into renting again and will move out and end the financial support to focus on their own living expenses. This is something we cannot afford to happen as it has been easier with them taking over all expenses but I still think I'm right and they should take my feedback.

The issue is not that she puts her body into some kind of exercise position. The issue is that it is a bit of an impropriety for another male to see it. So while I do believe you were in perfectly good order to tell your son (and not her) what you saw if you're really that conservative, what you should have asked is that she close the door.\n\nAs for how cluttered her own home office is, if it clashes with your decor, the solution is again the same, and this time I think you should have told her directly: tell her to close the door.

Why are the more traditional men lazier and more gossipy? They preach industriousness, respect, freedom, and personal responsibility, but they practice sloth, cattiness, intolerance, and entitlement. I\u2019ve seen it happen enough to suspect it\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t understand how or why it happens.", "More like drama baby \ud83d\udc76", "Tomato, tomahto.", "Thank goodness I\u2019m a boomer that\u2019s not like that", "I\u2019m going to bet the son and DIL will end up spending way more than the house is worth they are getting \u2018left\u2019.", "he has an NFT avatar now tho \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d one of the paid ones i think", "My hubby retired 10 years before me.  He took over all housekeeping, grocery shopping, laundry and cooking.  We still had 2 kids in college but planned ahead.  Glad I didn't get stuck with this AH", "66 yo woman, here. You are misogynistic and ungrateful. That woman who you judged for relaxing in the bed is paying all your bills while you leech off of her and your son. YTA. You should be ashamed of yourself!", "But, normal for his generation. It's the way it was..", "For sure, no one spends more useless time online than retired people. What I am saying is that true assholes wouldn't lay out each and every detail of how much of an AH they are. Instead they would hide, conciously or not, part of the truth, to make themselves come off in a better light. In this example, perhaps tell internet strangers that his DIL is behaving inappropriate in their home, not admit that he peaked into their bedroom.\n\nNot saying the situation isn't credible, it may have happened, but it's more likely the son or DIL who is telling the story.", "He is jealous of his son.  You think that his wife has sex with him anymore?", "You are wrong! I see many posts on reddit from young people at work, killing time, getting paid, bragging they are here posting, instead of working", "Ahahahahahahahahahahah winner", "The lazy, sponging AH has to poke his nose into their private areas of the house to find something to complain about DIL.", "he is more than selfish, he's a narcissist!", "He probably expected his wife to wait on him hand and foot, doing all the cooking and cleaning while supporting them both all those years until her heath gave out.", "Yes---They should evict HIM", "Sounds like he needs more to do. I suggest a job, since he\u2019s also concerned about expenses depleting his savings. Win-win.", "Of course not. Nor my spouse.", "YTA and I can't stress this enough, you're using your son and DIL as the providers but then expecting them to live by your standards like they're children. We follow the golden rule in my house, she who makes the gold makes the rules. Good for her for establishing boundaries. Also I noticed, you didn't care that you upset your daughter in law but that you may need to dip into your savings again. You are 100% the problem.", "AND OP retired early and now can\u2019t afford it. Whose fault was that?? YTA man. A big one.", "this!^ and if the messy office bothers OP so much he should clean it up himself", "100% can be. Be glad you live a life where this attitude is considered shocking. \ud83d\ude14", "Yeah, he was like \"Son has graduated from college and can now work? Check, I can retire now.\" How entitled and also stupid.", "How do you know my uncle?", ">Op, I am a 62 year old woman and I find you repugnant\n\n58 Year old guy and he disgusts me. Also, while his he perving on his DIL in her bedroom.\n\nYTA.", "Yes but OP is a guy, doesn't matter what us women say, he won't listen...", "LoL I can't stop thinking of her trying to make sure she stays in an uncomfortable position with clothes on and legs closed, trying to do it.", "LOL yeah, OP complains their savings are being dipped into.  but OP also retired who knows how much earlier than most people.   And then expects the *Children* to fill the gap!!    \n\n\nNext Level AH", "Ok, smart guy\u2026please name ONE culture where a MARRIED woman is not allowed to spread her legs in a bed she shares with her HUSBAND. I\u2019ll wait.", "It gets in the way don't cha know?", "Wow, I just.  YTA, for SO many reasons, it's 2023 bro not 1950.", "Honestly, the only valid reason he could have for retiring this early is because of a life-threatening injury or smth like that, but that still doesn't excuse his behavior.\n\nDefinitely the asshole here.", "Not to mention since their savings and emergency funds apparently are already getting low at this point... Maybe if he hadn't retired at 46 they'd have a little more built up? I'm not one who believes that everyone is obligated to work until they're physically unable to anymore; people deserve to enjoy retirement, but at the same time, it's interesting that he retired at quite an early age and expected his wife and now his son and DIL to work to support them.", "Might be madeup but its the truth for many Indians. This post seems like its been written by a daughter in law.", "Priceless\u2026.well said. I\u2019ve never heard that phrase before (sweet summer child). I may need to borrow it in the future.", "Me too!! I literally just googled the same thing. I am so confused at the fact her relaxing is bothersome to him (?)", "Maybe it's the DIL posting as him...then she can shove it in his face when they leave.", "Legs so akimbo during sex OP's head would explode.", "56, and I \"retired\" ten years ago after a stroke ended my driving career.\n\nI would have preferred to keep going to 70.", "YES EXACTLY\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Well to be fair, his wife was supposed to keep working. She only retired because of health issues. So he expected to milk a few more years out of his cash cow.", "YTA and extremely sexist.\n\nLet me get this straight:\n\n**I told my son that my daughter in law should spend extra time straightening up both their desks after work to keep the room organized. -** Ah, so the woman has to clean up for both of them.\n\nOn top of this, your policing how she relaxes in her own room?\n\nAnd the icing on the cake, they pay for EVERYTHING. Including your medications.\n\nYTA and I would move out.", "Curious why didn't you ask your son who is doing an equal amount of work to tidy the room- is it because he's a man and its not his job? Why is is her job alone?  She's making sure you can pay all your bills and maintain your house- she can sit however she pleases.  Huge, just huge  YTA."]}
