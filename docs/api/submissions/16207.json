I retired early when my youngest son (34m) completed his degree about 14 years ago.\n\nOur country currently has a housing crisis so my son and his wife rented when they started their marriage. When my wife and I noticed that we were dipping into our emergency fund and our savings was getting depleted, we asked our son and his wife to move in since the house is going to them when we pass anyway.\n\nThey both have stable jobs and my daughter-in-law has other side businesses that allow her to financially support her own parents as well. We belong to a culture where it's customary to take care of your parents when they get old.\n\nThey moved in and have been covering all expenses which helps us keep our savings intact. They pay for groceries, electricity, water, internet, our more expensive medications, and everything else around the house. They also paid for our annual property taxes. They also help around the house when they aren't working.\n\nOne thing I don't like is their style of living. They both work from home and they converted one of the spare rooms into an office and I hate how cluttered it can get when I walk past. I told my son that my daughter in law should spend extra time straightening up both their desks after work to keep the room organized.\n\nAt one point I walked past their bedroom while my son was walking out, so the door was ajar and I saw my daughter-in-law lounging on the bed, legs akimbo. I told my son it was unbecoming of a woman to behave like that. My son said she isn't like that in the living room but feels comfortable to lounge a bit freely in the privacy of their bedroom.\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law have been distant with me since, with my daughter-in-law barely speaking to me at all. My wife spoke to both of them to ask if they are okay and my daughter-in-law said she felt I was being misogynistic and that she didn't feel comfortable interacting with me anymore. She has also said to my wife that if she doesn't end up feeling better about this situation she will look into renting again and will move out and end the financial support to focus on their own living expenses. This is something we cannot afford to happen as it has been easier with them taking over all expenses but I still think I'm right and they should take my feedback.

I suppose you mean to present that the cost of their rent was extremely high, but I hardly find that relevant in a two-income household.\n\nYTA. I believe you are somewhat right, for completely the wrong reasons.\n\nIn respect to you seeing your daughter-in-law in a compromising body position, it was not appropriate for you to comment on how a married woman positions her body in a her own private room in a home where there are only other married people, and the only person in her age group is the person she is married to. The issue is not that she puts her body into some kind of exercise position. The issue is that it is a bit of an impropriety for another male to see it. So while I do believe you were in perfectly good order to tell your son (and not her) what you saw if you're really that conservative, what you should have asked is that she close the door.\n\nAs for how cluttered her own home office is, if it clashes with your decor, the solution is again the same, and this time I think you should have told her directly: tell her to close the door.
