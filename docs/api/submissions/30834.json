Fianc\u00e9 (26f) and I (30m) have been together almost 5 years and have lived together for close to 3. She does a lot of the grocery shopping/meal planning (mostly bc she likes to eat healthier than me and it\u2019s easier for her to do that if she\u2019s choosing meals). Each week she makes a list of what she needs from the grocery and will go shopping on weekend mornings while I stay back and catch up on cleaning and whatever needs done around apartment.  \n\nWe cleaned all day yesterday and then this morning we both woke up very early, so she suggested we go to the grocery together since there aren\u2019t chores left to do. She primarily shops at aldi and then whatever she can\u2019t find there she\u2019ll get next door at target. I planned on making us breakfast but we didn\u2019t have eggs so we needed to at least get them today. \n\nOn our way to aldi (we left for the 6 min drive @ 8:20am) we check when they open because neither of us thought about store not being open so early, and it says they don\u2019t open until 9. She says that since we are already in route, we can go to target first and look around and get an idea for Christmas gifts. This is when the issue started. \n\nI told her I didn\u2019t want to walk around and shop that early just to kill time and that we should just get the eggs we need today and go to aldi a different day. She responds something along the lines of \u201ctoday is the day I grocery shop and you and I know going a different day means me going after work through the week. If I don\u2019t get them today I\u2019m not making a special trip later in the week so if you don\u2019t like dinners  this week then that\u2019s your fault\u201d. I told her that she was threatening me with food and she said it\u2019s not a threat it\u2019s just her not giving into \u201cyet another\u201d ridiculous demand I have. \n\nWe go back and forth a bit and finally she told me that expecting her to drop me back off at home, then go back to the grocery we were just by is asking a lot and how only I could find a way to make a grocery trip I\u2019m not even buying a complete and utter hassle all because it\u2019s going to be a little longer than expected. We pull up to target (she\u2019s driving) and she gets out without saying anything, goes in, finds the eggs and self checks out, all while walking ahead of me. Now we are home and she\u2019s hardly spoken to me. \n\nAITA here? I feel SHE is unreasonable for expecting me to aimlessly walk around a target early just to wait for the store next door to open.", "created_utc": 1699797958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tkwxi/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_grocery_with_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you even like your girlfriend? \n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA.\n\n>going a different day means me going after work through the week\n\nShe gave you a perfectly reasonable answer as to why she can't go grocery shopping later on in the week: it's inconvenient and she's probably tired after work.\n\nIf she's in charge of all the cooking and meal planning in your relationship, she should be allowed to shop on the day that's most convenient for her. Not happy? *You* can do the grocery shopping, then.", "YTA grow up, she\u2019s threatening you?? What are you 12? She\u2019s absolutely right, going grocery shopping after a 8 hour work day?

You\u2019re 30, act like it.", "YTA.\n\nI get it, I hate hanging around shops with nothing to do. But you're out of the house and it's 40 dang minutes.

Do you even like her? \n\nWhat would you have done with the extra 30 mins at home anyway? You just don\u2019t want to be out. She explained that not going today messes with her post-work routines.

YTA.", "So your fianc\u00e9 helped you with your chores (the reason you had nothing to do for the house that day) and you made a HUGE deal about staying at Target for 30 minutes? You're behaving like a toddler who doesn't get the meaning of being part of a team just yet...\n\n\nListen. If your girlfriend helped you get your part of the work done, it's pretty reasonable for her to ask you for your company while she does hers. You didn't even had to help her, dude. She had the list done and aaaall you had to do was what? Walk beside her while she got what she needed TO FEED YOU ALL WEEK. Doesn't that sound lovely? Just spending a little time with her instead of expecting her to do all by herself and alone because you wanted to get back home. Maybe you could have made a lovely morning kinda window shopping for Christmas gifts, then chat a little while doing grocery shopping, maybe you could have gotten some ice cream later or get something extra from Aldi and spend the rest of the day sprawled in the couch together and eating junk for one time (or veggie straws since you said she want to keep it a little healthier). But noooooooo. You wanted to. Go. Home. Boohoo.\n\n\nIf you don't want your girlfriend then let me have her instead, she sounds lovely, responsible and very, very helpful in a REAL partnership.

Please appreciate her work more.\n\nYTA, again.", "YTA she wanted to spend some time with you. Do you even like your girlfriend? Also she wasn't threatening you. You need to apologise to your girlfriend because you made this an big deal when it wasn't.", "YTA in my opinion. It wouldn't have been a big deal just to roll with the flow.", "YTA.

You seem to think that she should do half of your chores and all of hers as a payment for the privilege of having you as her fiance.  \n\n\nDon't be surprised if she opts out of this arrangement and moves on to find someone who will be a partner, instead of an entitled and selfish brat.", "YTA. What were you doing first thing in the morning that was so important that you couldn't spend half an hour hanging out in Target until Aldi opened? Don't be weirdly inflexible.", "YTA. She does all of the shopping, most of the cooking\u2026 and you can\u2019t spend an extra 20 minutes at Target to make her life easier this week?", "Definitely YTA. Aplogize and offer to drive her to Aldi to do shopping for the week. Or have her write you down a list of what she wants. Take her out to dinner one night this week.

I don\u2019t predict this relationship will end well.", "YTA. Its like 30-40 minutes. You want her to spend 15 minutes driving your whiny ass home?", "YTA for missing an opportunity to justify hang out with your gf. You're being too pragmatic. Instead of being worried about the time wasted you should have just looked at it as an unplanned, unexpected chance to just ne together.", "YTA - oh no your significant other wanted to spend some quality time with you WHILE wandering around a shop. What a horrible life you must lead.", "YTA & pretty soon you won\u2019t have a gf to post about. you even mentioned that she said this was \u201cyet another ridiculous demand\u201d and you used \u201cdemand\u201d which means you basically want to have your cake & eat it too. but once you lose your gf then you\u2019re gonna be SOL and won\u2019t even know what went wrong. you need to take a step back, and look at what your issues are. this is a team, like you said, so yes, you have to do things that sometimes you aren\u2019t comfortable with doing because it makes your partner happy. i agree with the comments here, do you even like her?", "Seriously dude? You couldn\u2019t be bothered to kill 40 minutes with your girlfriend? YTA", "YTA Obviously!

Ima call her and tell her not to give you any ass until you grow the hell up.", "I\u2019m confused about why you not wanting to browse Target is more important than her not wanting to shop after work on a weekday.

It ain\u2019t gonna hurt you to spend time shopping with her.", "YTA.  You are making a big deal over something extremely minor and are acting like a petulant child.\n\nDoesn't your Target have a Starbucks?  I know their coffee isn't the best, but sit and visit with her over a cup of coffee and maybe a baked good (pick up a healthier snack in the Target if she wants).  It would be a better alternative than wandering the store and much better than throwing a tantrum.", "YTA", "Your fiance does the shopping and cooks for you every week and you can't hang out with her for 30 minutes in a Target to make her life easier? Then after your complaining she says fine, but don't complain about meals this week if you make her go home without shopping and you accuse her of threatening you with food? You are ridiculous.

It\u2019s magical", "YTA- You don\u2019t like her enough to hold her hand, walk around Target and look at holiday stuff? No wonder she\u2019s mad.

She took the time and HELPEF CLEAN .. skip to the next day \n\nYou agreed to go grocery shopping with her but the 30 min delay in the store opening inconvenienced you so much that u wanted to cancel it all together bc you didn\u2019t feel like walking around target with her  to kill time (which could have also helped  her check something\u2019s off her list later on when it came to Christmas shopping). \n\nI would have dropped your ass off at home went back to the store got just enough groceries to feed my self for the week and told you from now on u can do your own cooking", "YTA.

Plus she helped you clean all day the day before.

Why is hanging out with your gf for half an hour max that big of a deal. \n\ndo you not want to go shopping with her because it\u2019s boring to you? spending some time together doing something she likes is hardly a sacrifice on your part - just be nicer to your gf.", "YTA.

Fianc\u00e9 (26f) and I (30m) have been together almost 5 years and have lived together for close to 3. She does a lot of the grocery shopping/meal planning (mostly bc she likes to eat healthier than me and it\u2019s easier for her to do that if she\u2019s choosing meals). Each week she makes a list of what she needs from the grocery and will go shopping on weekend mornings while I stay back and catch up on cleaning and whatever needs done around apartment.  \n\nWe cleaned all day yesterday and then this morning we both woke up very early, so she suggested we go to the grocery together since there aren\u2019t chores left to do. She primarily shops at aldi and then whatever she can\u2019t find there she\u2019ll get next door at target. I planned on making us breakfast but we didn\u2019t have eggs so we needed to at least get them today. \n\nOn our way to aldi (we left for the 6 min drive @ 8:20am) we check when they open because neither of us thought about store not being open so early, and it says they don\u2019t open until 9. She says that since we are already in route, we can go to target first and look around and get an idea for Christmas gifts. This is when the issue started. \n\nI told her I didn\u2019t want to walk around and shop that early just to kill time and that we should just get the eggs we need today and go to aldi a different day. She responds something along the lines of \u201ctoday is the day I grocery shop and you and I know going a different day means me going after work through the week. If I don\u2019t get them today I\u2019m not making a special trip later in the week so if you don\u2019t like dinners  this week then that\u2019s your fault\u201d. I told her that she was threatening me with food and she said it\u2019s not a threat it\u2019s just her not giving into \u201cyet another\u201d ridiculous demand I have. \n\nWe go back and forth a bit and finally she told me that expecting her to drop me back off at home, then go back to the grocery we were just by is asking a lot and how only I could find a way to make a grocery trip I\u2019m not even buying a complete and utter hassle all because it\u2019s going to be a little longer than expected. We pull up to target (she\u2019s driving) and she gets out without saying anything, goes in, finds the eggs and self checks out, all while walking ahead of me. Now we are home and she\u2019s hardly spoken to me. \n\nAITA here? I feel SHE is unreasonable for expecting me to aimlessly walk around a target early just to wait for the store next door to open.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re telling me she shops, cooks, and pays for YOUR food.

Hopefully apologies and meaningful changes are in your future, because by all accounts you seem like a scrub.", "YTA for reasons everyone has already said. But I wouldn\u2019t worry too much OP. I don\u2019t think you need to worry about Christmas shopping with her this year. Lol. \n\nShe works as a member of the team. You act like you are somehow exempt from that same work ethic.", "YYA.

If you\u2019re a team as you say, then you\u2019d be along for the ride with her. Is it my husbands favourite when I make a few quick stops at places he doesn\u2019t need anything? Of course not, and I don\u2019t \u201cwant\u201d to wander around looking at hockey equipment or tools in Home Depot, but if we\u2019re out running errands, that\u2019s how it goes. You didn\u2019t have to go with her - you could have declined. Instead, you accepted her invitation and complained the whole time about how she carries out her errands. Maybe you don\u2019t realize how tedious it becomes to be the only one who meal plans and grocery shops. Even if you don\u2019t nitpick at what she makes, it\u2019s still nice to have help and some of that burden lifted (and physically cooking 1-2x per week won\u2019t necessarily do that). Married couples do have little tiffs here and there over minute things, but if this is how you approach things that you deem effectively inconvenient for you, you\u2019re going to have a little more flexibility in your relationship and marriage.

She spent all day helping do the things you do yesterday, and you can't walk around target for 30 minutes?\n\nIt wasn't a threat, btw, she was telling you what will happen.

As a woman, I generally think that commenters on AITA are 80% against men but not this time.  You may be someone who hates \"window shopping (just walking around a store and not actually purchasing anything)\" but as others have commented, you could have suggested getting coffee/breakfast instead until Aldi's open and if she said no, then you should have sucked it up for 30 minutes.", "YTA!! so she cooks food for you all the time and you can\u2019t be bothered to wander around target??? You don\u2019t deserve her. You are a partnership. You are both responsible for caring for each other.

Again, you don\u2019t deserve her.", "If you didn't want to go grocery shopping with her, you could have stayed home.  It sounds like she wanted some company and to spend time with you. \n\nDo you frequently act like it's a chore to do little errands with her?\nDo you value your time above hers? Maybe answer that before marriage. It'll be cheaper that way. \n\nYTA", "Yes you ATA and you already know it. You sound very spoiled actually. You better step up or someone else is going to scoop this women up away from you. She deserves you sucking it up and doing something you don't want to for forty minutes. You are a spoiled toddler and it seems she is almost over it by the way she responded. You need to decide if you actually love and cherish this women because at this rate you marriage is on its way to be over before you even tie the knot.\n\nOf course you think she is being unreasonable because you are overly self important at her expense.", "YTA.  You both work full time, correct?  After working all day, the last thing I would want to do is go to the grocery store to buy all the groceries for the week.  Buying this way is helpful for menu planning and people tend to spend less per week because there is less opportunity for impulse purchases.  Your fiance is doing you a huge favor by taking on the menu planning and shopping.  She asked you to go with her ONE TIME and you had to get huffy about it.  You owe her an apology.  If she told you she was done doing this task and it's on you now, I would applaud her.", "Bro spend some fucking time with your wife. Jesus Christ. YTA", "Yes YTA. I do all the cooking and most of the shopping, because my husband works all week. But he\u2019s smart enough to catch that the rare times I ask him to go along with me, it\u2019s because I just want to spend time with him. He also realizes when I do the same for him, so he goes along.", "I wish my partner would pick up more household tasks like going to the shops for groceries.\n\nJust be grateful. She wants to spend time with you and do errands at the same time.  One day she might not want to do either.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.

But really if 40 min is such a killer for you, you shouldn\u2019t be in this relationship.", "YTA Grow up. Who is going to shop for you when she leaves you?", "YTA. I mean this with ALL the disrespect in the world, GROW UP. She didn\u2019t threaten you, you whiny little baby. She explained to you WHY she has a schedule and plans to go shopping a specific day. She works, does all the shopping, meal plans, and cooks for you. And you act like this? Because you couldn\u2019t handle spending 30 minutes with her? There were endless things you could\u2019ve suggested. You two could\u2019ve gotten a coffee and sat down together instead. You\u2019re being ate up in the comments and it\u2019s well deserved. The fact that this post was made (allegedly) by a 30 year old and not a 12 year old is exactly why I have no plans on getting married in the future.", "YTA. You were the unreasonable one. It wouldn\u2019t have killed you to walk around target for 40 minutes. But instead you had a tantrum like a toddler. Going a different day or dropping you off and then going back would have been an inconvenience for her but you don\u2019t care. Do you even like your girlfriend?", "YTA. What was so utterly important that you couldn't kill 30 minutes at Target with her? It makes sense you're already out, she shouldn't have to go drop your little butt off back home and then turn around and have to drive back to the store because it's just too long for you to wait, and you don't want to walk around Target for 30 minutes it's just so hard. So she was right to say well fine I'm not going shopping today then so I guess I'm not making dinner this week and you take that as a threat. It's a statement she saying okay fine well we're not going to go shopping now then it's not going to get done for a while cuz I'm not doing it after work. Believe me it sucks going grocery shopping after work you're tired you don't want to be there. My mom used to make me go grocery shopping with her after work on Fridays, I hated it so much. We worked together and this was her plan every week. Saturday mornings we cleaned the house.", "Hmmm, so let me get this straight. You went with her to grocery shop. The store wasn't going to open for another 40 min. So you wanted to grab eggs, go home, and sit around and make her go grocery shopping after work on the weekdays when she was tired and just wanted to go home to eat dinner and rest. A dinner she will most likely be cooking BTW. I am sure that if she chose to grocery shop on one of those nights, you would complain about how late dinner is and whine about that was well.... so, back to the shopping/waiting you were complaining abput...Because you what....didn't want to spend 40 minutes actually talking to or spending time with her? That sitting across a table drinking coffee with her and talking was too much to ask? That it was too much effort on your part to walk around Target and check out and talk to her about Christmas presents for family? Let me guess, she does all of that shopping too? Then, when she said she would not go out of her way to grocery shop during the week, so she won't be cooking dinner, you tell her she is threatening you with food? Seriously? She was simply stating her boundaries, and you tried to turn it into her being controlling when actually you were just being petty and childish. So what were you in a big hurry to get home to do that was more important to you than your girlfriend? TV? Video games? Hanging with the guys? You might want to start appreciating her more and making her more of a priority, instead of a convenience, before she starts thinking about making you part of her history.", "YTA\n\nOmg it was only 40 min. As a person who has done planning for me and my ex, your fianc\u00e9 is just being logical. Planning is a lot and you should appreciate that amount of effort. \n\nMy ex couldn\u2019t even be bothered to put in the amount of planning I have done to just manage the household.

It\u2019s easier for me to do it anyway without him complaining plus I get some alone time. I clean and cook and he cleans and cooks. There are some things I loathe doing and he does. Does he complain? No. Because there is balance. Do people really think he should have to fake enjoying something he does just bc I want him to come with me? That\u2019s ridiculous. Simply make it up to her by saying I really don\u2019t like shopping, but I\u2019ll help you with something else this week or today to make up for that and you can relax.

Yet you pouted anyway. Then you accused her of threatening you with food because she pointed out if she doesn't buy food, you may not like the meals SHE makes do to the limited food options. That's her pointing out the consequences of skipping grocery shopping, aka the consequences of your actions.

A favor that you can\u2019t even fathom reciprocating? Because I don\u2019t think you think about these things at all.
