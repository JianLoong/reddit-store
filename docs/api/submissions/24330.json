He will come and grab all the mail and then come back later and put my mail back. I went over to ask him about it and he said that the previous tenant had asked him to please grab his mail for him. I said that was nice of him but that I would appreciate if he could please leave my mail alone. I wasn't rude or anything I don't think. He said that he was friends with the guy and that he made a promise. I had a solution. I said that I would bring in all my mail from the mailbox and then put his friend's mail in his after I sorted it. For some reason this wasn't acceptable. I was going to even offer to let him look through the mail on my step and take his friend's stuff and leave my mail in my box without taking it with him. Until he said he didn't want a stranger putting stuff in his mailbox. The lack of self awareness was sickening. I told him to stay off my property or I would be upset. Then I left. \n\nHe did it again. I went to the post office to see if I could get his friend's mail forwarded to his address or to see if the change of address form was not processed. I just didn't want this guy taking my mail. \n\nAnd that is when I found out that stealing mail is a serious crime down here. The USPS actually has their own cops. And that stealing mail is a serious crime. \n\nMy neighbor came over again yesterday to apologize and to promise that he would not take my mail again and to ask me to talk to his lawyer and explain that he never kept any of my mail. \n\nI said that I would. I was talking to my dad bout it all and he said I was kind of mean to get this guy in trouble for doing his friend s favour.  I said that I thought the guy was rude and I didn't know if he was giving me back everything he took.

You didn't actually go there to get the guy in trouble, so you were going out of your way to, again, try to be nice and have the issue corrected by having the mail forwarded from your box.\n\nI also like how your neighbor asked you to talk to his lawyer and explain he never kept your mail.  In actuality, how do you know that?  If he kept something and never gave it to you, how would you know?  That's why we don't allow people to come and grab another person's mail and take it into their homes.\n\nIt actually sounds like you were nice and continued to try and be nice about it.

He rejected both of those options.  You were perfectly nice.  Your neighbor was a jerk.\n\nYou were also nice to even speak to your neighbor's lawyer, and helped your neighbor avoid serious consequences for his actions.

It's your place, now, not his friend's.  Your solution of giving mail back to him from his buddy was sound, reasonable, and neighborly.  To continue to go through your box was criminal.  He's not likely to get into to much trouble for the one offense, though.  So don't worry too much about it.

The USPS doesn't fuck around with that.  And, yeah, he knew that, because everybody who lives in the US knows that.  It's a very popular piece of cultural lore.  Although I don't know how they can PROVE he did it, since you haven't mentioned providing them with the security camera footage.  It's possible that when the Postal Inspectors came to talk to him about it, he admitted it.  If so, he's boned, and no mistake.\n\nI'm not clear on why he wants you to go tell his lawyer he didn't keep any of your mail- you have no idea if he kept any of your mail.

Other identifying info could be easy for him to obtain.", "NTA, he committed a crime by removing your mail from the mailbox, which iirc is considered propery of the USPS. How do you know he didn't keep any of your mail? You can't. \n\nDo not talk to his lawyer without representation yourself. You can not state he never kept any of your mail because it is absolutely *impossible* for you to know.\n\nThere are forwarding processes, so the previous person shouldn't have even asked this of the neighbor.

Don't do a thing except answer the questions in any investigation truthfully.\n\nMaybe it isn't, but I always thought it common knowledge that you do not remove anything from someone else's mailbox or open mail not addressed to you because it is *illegal*.", "NTA obviously but why is the previous tenant still getting mail delivered in the first place?\n\nHe can just set up a forwarding order.", "NTA\n\nMaking a promise to a previous tenant is not a pass to violate the law.
