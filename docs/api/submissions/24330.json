He will come and grab all the mail and then come back later and put my mail back. I went over to ask him about it and he said that the previous tenant had asked him to please grab his mail for him. I said that was nice of him but that I would appreciate if he could please leave my mail alone. I wasn't rude or anything I don't think. He said that he was friends with the guy and that he made a promise. I had a solution. I said that I would bring in all my mail from the mailbox and then put his friend's mail in his after I sorted it. For some reason this wasn't acceptable. I was going to even offer to let him look through the mail on my step and take his friend's stuff and leave my mail in my box without taking it with him. Until he said he didn't want a stranger putting stuff in his mailbox. The lack of self awareness was sickening. I told him to stay off my property or I would be upset. Then I left. \n\nHe did it again. I went to the post office to see if I could get his friend's mail forwarded to his address or to see if the change of address form was not processed. I just didn't want this guy taking my mail. \n\nAnd that is when I found out that stealing mail is a serious crime down here. The USPS actually has their own cops. And that stealing mail is a serious crime. \n\nMy neighbor came over again yesterday to apologize and to promise that he would not take my mail again and to ask me to talk to his lawyer and explain that he never kept any of my mail. \n\nI said that I would. I was talking to my dad bout it all and he said I was kind of mean to get this guy in trouble for doing his friend s favour.  I said that I thought the guy was rude and I didn't know if he was giving me back everything he took.

You didn't actually go there to get the guy in trouble, so you were going out of your way to, again, try to be nice and have the issue corrected by having the mail forwarded from your box.\n\nI also like how your neighbor asked you to talk to his lawyer and explain he never kept your mail.  In actuality, how do you know that?  If he kept something and never gave it to you, how would you know?  That's why we don't allow people to come and grab another person's mail and take it into their homes.\n\nIt actually sounds like you were nice and continued to try and be nice about it.

He rejected both of those options.  You were perfectly nice.

Although I don't know how they can PROVE he did it, since you haven't mentioned providing them with the security camera footage.  It's possible that when the Postal Inspectors came to talk to him about it, he admitted it.  If so, he's boned, and no mistake.\n\nI'm not clear on why he wants you to go tell his lawyer he didn't keep any of your mail- you have no idea if he kept any of your mail.

How do you know he didn't keep any of your mail? You can't. \n\nDo not talk to his lawyer without representation yourself. You can not state he never kept any of your mail because it is absolutely *impossible* for you to know.\n\nThere are forwarding processes, so the previous person shouldn't have even asked this of the neighbor.

Don't do a thing except answer the questions in any investigation truthfully.\n\nMaybe it isn't, but I always thought it common knowledge that you do not remove anything from someone else's mailbox or open mail not addressed to you because it is *illegal*.", "NTA obviously but why is the previous tenant still getting mail delivered in the first place?\n\nHe can just set up a forwarding order.", "NTA\n\nMaking a promise to a previous tenant is not a pass to violate the law.

Maybe he's taking your stuff, maybe he's taking his friend's (or his own) but doesn't want you to see it.\n* He wants to be able to look through your mail at his leisure--maybe to take something, maybe to see who you're getting mail from.\n* Dementia or some other mental confusion.  (Maybe some part of him keeps thinking, e.g., the neighbor is on vacation and asked him to take in their mail, so he does.  Then realizes later that that's not right and brings it back.)", "NTA - As a fellow Canadian I say screw that guy. He has absolutely no right to be going through your mail! That\u2019s absolutely absurd. His friend could maybe not be lazy and get his mail forwarded if he\u2019s that worried.", "NTA You didn\u2019t even know you were going to get him in trouble you were just trying to get his alleged friends mail forwarded through the /proper/ channels and even if you did know it was a reasonable response\nIf someone doesn\u2019t want things escalated to an authority they gotta respect an established boundary if they don\u2019t they\u2019re not allowed to be surprised when the person seeks help to hold that boundary", "Nta- You WERE polite your neighbor decided he wanted to continue to be rude.", "NTA you gave him several very kind and reasonable solutions. Yes taking somebody's mail is a federal crime pretty much most people in this country know that and I'm pretty sure he did too. And you're right you have no way of knowing if he's returning all of your things to you.", "NTA standing up for yourself is not rude.", "Nah man he shoulda left your mail alone after you asked him nicely the first time eh. You offered a totally reasonable solution. Also his friend should have just set up his forwarding address it's not hard takes 5 mins online ya know. It's his own fault he's in trouble.", "NTA. He steals your mail. He should've told the guy to put in his change of address.\n\nIt's well known in the US that interference with mail is a crime. Your neighbor FAFO. This is not your issue, it's between him and the postal inspector", "NTA\n\nYou really don't know if he was actually picking up the mail for the last tenant. For all you know, he has been running scams and using your address to get mail for the scam. For example, he could be a money mule for romance scammers and having the victims send money via mail to your address, then taking the mail. He could be running credit card scams and having the bills sent to your house. Once you put him on notice to stop and even offered him other options, then he should have stopped. You don't actually know he didn't steal your mail. I would not talk to his lawyer at all. You say he wasn't stealing your mail and later on it comes out your address was used for scams and you have let him off the hook.", "Was given several options. AKA -warnings. Disregarded.", "You feel shitty because you're a good person. Your neighbor only feels shitty because he's in legal trouble because he broke the law. You *tried* to fix this without involving the law, and he refused. You are not responsible for the actions of other adults around you.", "Buddy I have a very similar parent and I'm going to tell you if you listen to their backseat moral attitude in your life instead of your gut you WILL BE WALKED ALL OVER.\n\nThe reason there's a serious penalty for this is that it's a SERIOUS crime. You're generous for even assuming that the guy isn't doing something malicious. They could be going through your mail for anything from identity theft to tax fraud and you would have no way of knowing until it happened. That's why this has harsh penalties.\n\nAlso as you've said yourself this guy doesn't want someone going through HIS mail so in principle he understands what he's doing is wrong. This means he is doing it with explicit malicious intent or just doesn't think those rules apply to him. Either way you cannot give someone like that an inch.\n\nAnd DON'T tell his lawyer what he wants you to say because you literally cannot know that information.", "NTA. I would feel shitty about non-intentionally getting someone in trouble too. But that guy is from here and should know that it's a crime. You have no clue if he actually gave all of your mail back or not. You have been nice and tried to give solutions and he refused; this whole thing is on him. And you also don't know if the previous tenant actually gave the guy permission to take his mail. Only way to find that out is finding the previous tenant and asking. If you talk to his lawyer, ask him if he is sure you got all of your mail and if the previous tenant indeed gave him permission to take his mail. I bet he can't answer that either.", "OP also doesn't know if their neighbour just made notes about mail OP receives regularly to steal mail that doesn't come regularly.", "Mail forwarding exists but there\u2019s always a few things that get through the cracks. \n\nIf there\u2019s no one living at the house and I have this kind of arrangement with the previous tenants, I\u2019ll grab the mail and forward it along. \n\nThe second there is someone new, I\u2019ll introduce myself, tell them about the arrangement and we figure out a plan (they forward themselves, or they text me and I\u2019ll come get it). \n\nBut nah, there\u2019s no need to be stealing mail and walking away with it.", "Exactly this OP, they broke the law not you.", "That's nice. Fucking Canada post makes us pay $100 to forward mail for a year. And they still fuck that up all the time too.", "Never heard of this", "I can predict the non imaged items", "My family is totally blown away by Informed Delivery and I have to field the same questions regularly about it. Like Dad asking me why his mail/packages show up on my dashboard...because we both live here and it tells me the mail coming to this address! Now it's questions about whether I can see other shipments, and I have to ask how the thing was shipped (\"Oh it's UPS,\" yeah I can't see that).\n\nHe's an IT guy. Sign up for your own Informed Delivery lol", "It\u2019s like they want to handle a bunch of mail being returned to sender.", "Yeah or the local enforcement agency.  I've seen tons of Theft of Mail and Illegal Mail Key charges under the criminal code (I'm a criminal lawyer).", "I only found this out when I did a mail hold - because we were on an extended trip - a few years ago, and somehow Informed Delivery showed up as an option; now I get an email every day about what supposed to be delivered, and if it\u2019s more than a day late, I contact the local Post Office and it gets squared away quickly.", "That's honestly wild. I know if something hasn't been delivered it tends to show up the next day or so, especially around the holidays. I'm sorry folks are like that, and thanks for your work.", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. NTA", "NTA. You know he removed mail from your mailbox.  You know he didn\u2019t return all of it.  You don\u2019t know what he didn\u2019t return or to whom it was addressed.  He may have stolen some of your mail in an effort to steal your identity, bank account information, etc.  You asked him to stop, offered reasonable alternatives, he didn\u2019t cooperate.  You did what was necessary to protect yourself and your identity.  Some people understand a clear unequivocal \u201cno\u201d, some people only understand the equivalent of a 2 x 4 upside the head.  You are fluent in both languages.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to reach a compromise and he denied it. Yea you probably escalated to 100 pretty quickly, but you weren't in the wrong. The guy could have just forwarded the mail to his house instead of digging through yours after you asked him to stop.", "NTA, IMHO you were too nice.", "NTA.\n\nTampering with mail is indeed a federal crime, with some serious penalties including fines or even jail time.  That said, you made it very clear he was not to do this, period.  The fact you went to try and fix it and he got in trouble for his own actions isn't on you.  I mean the idea that you're even willing to help by talking to his lawyer is going above and beyond in my book.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. And honestly, how do you KNOW that he never kept any of your mail?", " Nta you tried to be very polite and understanding but he absolutely could have stolen mail from you, it\u2019s sus, now he\u2019ll know better", "NTA I have lived in this house for four years this month and the assholes who lived here prior never forwarded their mail. They left no contact information. I am SO sick of returning their mail. I'm glad you could quickly resolve this.", "NTA. I\u2019m Canadian and he was kind of rude. You may want to get a locked mailbox.", "fafo. listen to ppl when they tell you to keep your hands to yourself and to fuck off. it is that simple. NTA", "NTA at best you can tell the lawyer that as far as you know he gave you all your mail back\u2026\u2026 which probably wouldn\u2019t help him.", "NTA, OP! That is creepy and a crime! You offered solutions and the neighbor turned them down. He's committing a crime.", "NTA. You nicely gave him the opportunity to not do what he was doing. He did it anyway. The reason the USPS is taking it seriously, is because it's something serious. As you said, you don't actually know he's putting all your mail back.\n\nEven if it's true that he was taking the former tenant's mail, he didn't need to take all of it. It's suspicious at best. Very easy to grab only the pieces of make that have the other guy's name on it and leaving the rest. Also, mail forwarding is incredibly easy to setup. USPS makes it SO easy to do this. So...his story...doesn't sound true.", "NTA. And why would you talk to his lawyer? Definitely don\u2019t exonerate him by saying \u201che returned all your mail\u201d. Did he really?", ">to ask me to talk to his lawyer and explain that he never kept any of my mail.\n\nHow would you know if he kept any of your mail? You didn't get to see it before he took it.\n\nNTA. You tried to talk to him and work out how to let him get his friend's mail but not disturb yours and he refused to cooperate. FAFO.", "NTA.  Your neighbour deserved to get in trouble.  You were polite, gave a reasonable solution, and he still stole your mail. I\u2019d be furious if someone did that to my mail, seeing everything I received, having mail possibly not returned, and having to wait for important mail.", "Honestly, you didn\u2019t know the possible repercussions of your actions but what he was doing was absolutely NOT OKAY. His friend doesn\u2019t live there anymore. That\u2019s his problem. Not yours. And I\u2019d be HELLA suspicious that he could have kept something. It\u2019s really shady. \n\nI say this as a suspicious American \ud83d\ude02\nBut NTA", "Neighbor was committing a felony. You are NTA", "Absolutely do NOT put it in writing that this guy returned all your mail. You don\u2019t know that he did and the lawyer can use that against you", "That's HIS problem. For all you know he could have opened credit card/credit accounts in your name, have access to your banking info. I would check your credit report ASAP and a put freeze on your credit. \nNTA", "That\u2019s on him for being so stubborn", "Don't feel bad. Thieves need to be put in situations that they will never forget. Otherwise they never learn.", "Stop being so Canadian about it lol (from another Canadian)\n\nThis guy continously kept helping himself to your mail and was asked to stop multiple times and offered many other solutions, but chose to keep being a total creep about it. If he gets in trouble for it, then good! Don't touch my shit lol", "1) It is not your fault. You made every attempt to get him to correct the behavior\n\n2) It is not likely that they will seek the most severe penalties unless they determine that there was malicious intent. If he was keeping his old neighbor's mail, or using the mails to commit other crimes, or something, then they may pursue it to that level. Most likely they just want him to know that serious consequences are possible so he just gets scared away from stealing your mail.", "You have no idea if he stole your mail and your identity or else.", "As a Canadian, I got a kick out of this.  But NTA-- he was plenty nice (even by Cdn standards)", "Try submitting a complaint here? \nhttps://usps.my.site.com/emailus/s/informed-delivery-inquiry", "NTA every American knows you don't fuck with USPS. Completely on him.", "NTA! Don\u2019t talk to his lawyer and say he never kept your mail. He may have kept lots of it.", "He was asked to stop taking your mail. As an American (I'm assuming he is) he knows the laws on messing with people's mail. It's one the post offices do not take lightly. He should have taken you on your offer to wait for you before you both sorted through it together. That was honestly a very generous offer as you can just sort through it, put \"no longer lives here\" on his friends mail and send it back through the mailbox, or take it back to the lost office all together. You're nta at all.", "NTA. \nEx USPS employee here.    You did everything right.  It\u2019s not his responsibility to go through YOUR mailbox. \nSounds to me like you were civil enough,  he\u2019s just an unaware goober.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him options and warnings, and he insisted on Playing Stupid Games.\nWhen your Stupid Game is a federal offense, you win a very Stupid Prize.\n\n\nDo not call his lawyer. If the lawyer contacts you, tell only the truth. You don't *know* that he didn't keep any of your mail, so do not say that. You could say you don't know for certain that anything was missing, but how could you?", "You\u2019re NTA, and you didn\u2019t even know that mail theft here is a serious crime. I can guarantee you that your neighbor already knew.", "NTA. This guy wanted to go through your mail. You have no evidence that what he said about his relationship with the previous tenant is true or not. Not only that, but you gave him several chances and bent over backwards to accommodate his ridiculous actions and he still insisted. He\u2019s the asshole and should deal with the consequences.", "Nta you asked him to stop and he never so now he can deal with the consequences as you said how do you know if he actually returned all of your mail for all you know he could be getting things in your name personally I\u2019d leave him to sort out his own legal issues and if lock down my credit just incase", "Nta", "NTA. You told this man to stay off your property and away from his mail. He fucked around and found out. \n\nEven if he goes to prison it will be 0% your fault.", "NTA. You were not trying to get him in trouble, you were just inquiring at the post office about forwarding mail, he got himself in trouble. He should never have gone in your mailbox. I have been the new neighbor many times and that's not really how it's done if you are depending on an old neighbor to collect your mail. He should have just introduced himself, let you know he was collecting leftover mail for the old tenant, and could you kindly drop any off to him maybe once a week until it's all done. That's the way civilized people do that.", "YSK that you can purchase a locking mailbox to replace your current one. The mailman can drop your mail into the slot, and it can only be retrieved with a key. It shouldn't be your burden to have to spend money, but, it is a solution. \n\nAside from that,  NTA. Neighbor is breaking federal law, and has no right to open your mailbox.\n\nEdit- he takes ALL your mail and returns it later?  He could just stand at your box for 15 seconds, go through it and take only the previous residence's mail and leave yours. This is shady.", "Nowhere in the text does it say that OP is female.", "The dude should be put away , what an idiot", "NTA. Some people need to learn the hard way"]}
