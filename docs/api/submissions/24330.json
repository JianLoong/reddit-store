He will come and grab all the mail and then come back later and put my mail back. I went over to ask him about it and he said that the previous tenant had asked him to please grab his mail for him.

He said that he was friends with the guy and that he made a promise. I had a solution. I said that I would bring in all my mail from the mailbox and then put his friend's mail in his after I sorted it. For some reason this wasn't acceptable. I was going to even offer to let him look through the mail on my step and take his friend's stuff and leave my mail in my box without taking it with him. Until he said he didn't want a stranger putting stuff in his mailbox. The lack of self awareness was sickening. I told him to stay off my property or I would be upset. Then I left. \n\nHe did it again. I went to the post office to see if I could get his friend's mail forwarded to his address or to see if the change of address form was not processed. I just didn't want this guy taking my mail. \n\nAnd that is when I found out that stealing mail is a serious crime down here. The USPS actually has their own cops.

You didn't actually go there to get the guy in trouble, so you were going out of your way to, again, try to be nice and have the issue corrected by having the mail forwarded from your box.\n\nI also like how your neighbor asked you to talk to his lawyer and explain he never kept your mail.  In actuality, how do you know that?  If he kept something and never gave it to you, how would you know?  That's why we don't allow people to come and grab another person's mail and take it into their homes.\n\nIt actually sounds like you were nice and continued to try and be nice about it.

He rejected both of those options.  You were perfectly nice.

Although I don't know how they can PROVE he did it, since you haven't mentioned providing them with the security camera footage.  It's possible that when the Postal Inspectors came to talk to him about it, he admitted it.  If so, he's boned, and no mistake.\n\nI'm not clear on why he wants you to go tell his lawyer he didn't keep any of your mail- you have no idea if he kept any of your mail.

How do you know he didn't keep any of your mail? You can't. \n\nDo not talk to his lawyer without representation yourself. You can not state he never kept any of your mail because it is absolutely *impossible* for you to know.\n\nThere are forwarding processes, so the previous person shouldn't have even asked this of the neighbor.

He chose not to do all of the above.\n\nLet him stew in it.\n\nAlso, you have no idea *if* he kept anything he stole from you.  Not sure why you'd tell any attorney differently.", "Right? OP shouldn't be handing over the previous tenant's mail to someone it isn't addressed to either. Not unless they heard it from the previous tenant directly,  not just \"Joe told me i can take it\".", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. OP has zero proof the neighbor didn\u2019t take any of his mail.", "Agree with all of this. Also, consider installing (or asking the landlord to install) a mailbox that locks. This way, he cannot continue snooping.", "Some people just don't care. I bought my house 5 months ago from a flipping company, and I get mail for the guy who sold it to them literally everyday, some of which looks like it may be important. There's nothing I can do about it other than write \"RTS Does Not Live Here\" and put it back into circulation. And no, he's not dead.", "I still get crap for the previous owner of our townhome. We bought the place 15 years ago. \n\nNTA", "nta. since you very kindly agreed to talk to his lawyer, you should also be sure to very kindly offer the usps guys copies of the video. and don\u2019t lie to his lawyer, ie don\u2019t tell him your neighbor didn\u2019t keep any of your mail, tell him you have received all the mail you expected to receive (if you did) but you don\u2019t know if he kept anything you weren\u2019t expecting. this guy is a criminal. you called him on it, you offered different solutions for him, and he didn\u2019t give a shit. he kept doing it. he\u2019s not a nice guy. these are his consequences coming, which he earned fair and square.", "if your area has it, look into informed delivery. they send you a scan of everything coming to you.", "Don\u2019t feel shitty about it. Your neighbor was wrong and your dad is wrong. \n\nI\u2019ve had neighbors who moved and I helped make sure they got any mail that had been delivered to their old house. I did this by introducing myself to the new neighbors and talking with them about it. Never once did I touch the new neighbors\u2019 mail and I got a couple of small bundles of things for my old neighbors to hand off to them until their change of address went through everywhere.", "Don't. You didn't know what he was doing was illegal, but he did, so that's on him. At least you know now that you won't have any further issues with this guy. Set boundaries and set 'em hard.", "Provide his lawyer with the first of him taking it AND returning it and his lawyer will do the work of mitigating that. \n\nIf people commit crimes against us is not on us to prevent their consequences for that. You weren\u2019t malicious this is simply his natural consequences and you are providing what he needs to get a lesser punishment. I\u2019m sorry, but your parents are wrong and if they keep bullying you for this they become the AH. \n\nNTA - from a Canadian also living in the US", "That's not on you though. Your idea was more than reasonable. NTA by a mile.", "I understand that since you're from Canada, learning that messing with other people's mail is a serious offense is surprising. But to nearly any American adult, this is not surprising news. He knows they don't play and it's a federal crime. You asked nicely, offered alternate options for him to continue collecting his friends mail, and even went out of your way to see if there was anything more you could do to help with the situation by contacting USPS. It was not malicious. You didn't contact them solely to get the guy into trouble. I get why you might still feel bad for the guy, since it was not your intention to get him into trouble, but you've done all you can do. \"Swearing\" the guy didn't take your mail would be a lie, since you can't actually be sure.  If he'd been a decent person and admitted to himself that he was invading your privacy, refusing to back off and breaking the law at the same time, he wouldn't be in this mess. NTA.", "Honestly, most adults in the US know this is a big no-no. This isn't some hidden rule that the common citizen has absolutely no awareness of.\n\nThere really is no way your neighbor didn't know that taking the mail from your mailbox isn't OK on any level.\n\n\nYou approached him politely, and he refused to do the decent thing. You didn't intend to get him in trouble, so absolutely none of this is on you.\n\nIt isn't your fault you were unaware the post office has probably the best law enforcement arm in the U.S. and that mail boxes are considered a federal jurisdiction.", "Your neighbor\u2019s legal problems are of his own making.  Not yours.  He was never going to stop.", "That's a fair point.  OP could/should just right  \"Return to Sender\" and put it back in the mailbox.\n\nReturn to Sender.  Address unknown.

Our mail is through a slit into the garage and there were a couple 5gal buckets worth: urgent-looking letters from the school district, collections notices, etc.\n\nWe wrote \u201cnot at this address\u201d and put them in a mail box. Took more than a year for it to stop coming, but it mostly has.", "Elvis has left the building.\n\n(and apparently didn't give a forwarding address so his neighbor is just taking his mail!)  LOL!", "> No such number. No such soul.\n\nSurely it should be: No such number. No such zone", "I still get mail at my house from 2 owners and 12 years ago.   I've lived here for 3 years.  I put return to sender on them and put it in the mailbox but it keeps coming.\n\nTax notices, Christmas cards, Retirement Account updates (from the look of them) and so on.  About 1 every, or every other, month.  Weird.", "\u201cNot at this address\u201d has worked much better than \u201creturn to sender\u201d for us. No idea why"]}
