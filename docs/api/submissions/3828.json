The only good thing about her are my three nephews (ages 5 to 12).\n\nMy brother and SIL are flat broke from their various business ventures and are really struggling. I've stepped up many times with financial assistance. For example, I'm the one who paid for my nephews' extracurricular activities.\n\nRecently, their financial situation got so bad that they can barely afford groceries. They were literally splitting peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\nThat was unacceptable  and I offered to buy them weekly groceries. They accepted my help. \n\nI don't do online grocery shopping because most of the time they get the order wrong or don't have what I want. So I just go to the store. I'd get an email from my bro or SIL asking for stuff. I'd buy their groceries with mine and then drop their stuff off.\n\nIt's not the money that annoys me, it's the extra work of bagging and going on the opposite direction of my house to drop off their stuff. Again, I do it for my nephews and it gives me a chance to see them.\n\nThis week I did the grocery shopping on my lunch break and texted my SIL to come outside to get their stuff. My brother was out on interviews and my nephews were at school.\n\nShe just said to leave the groceries on the door step. I said I'm not UberEATS. I'm doing you a favor by feeding your family so give me the respect of at least coming to your door and acknowledging me. Show me some respect for the time, money and effort that I've put in.\n\nNo, she wasn't in a situation to where she could not have taken a minute to do this. She was probably on social media.\n\nShe came to the door and had a bad attitude. I told her that if my buying and dropping off groceries was \"too much\" work for her then I won't do it anymore. \n\nLater my brother called to find out what happened and I told him. He said my SIL said I was volatile towards her and she didn't understand why. I told him that she knew and now I'm not doing Xmas if she doesn't get on the phone to apologize to me.\n\nShe did and blamed her \"hormones.\" I told her that I don't care about her hormones. I'm not going to let her disrespect me and let her think that she gets a pass by blaming her hormones. \n\nSo, yes, I'll cancel Xmas if she's going to be rude to me. I'd hate for that to happen but that's on my brother and SIL to burden. \n\nAnd it's not her hormones. She's always had this nasty attitude. It's not new.\n\nEdit: If she had a good reason as to why she couldn't answer the door then she would had said so. \n\nEdit: Saying that a woman can get a pass for being an ass as long as she blames her hormones is like saying  a man can get a pass for being an ass by saying \"boys will be boys.\"", "created_utc": 1670055724, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbbgql/aita_for_telling_my_sil_i_will_cancel_xmas_over/", "score": 1842, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe dial back what you physically do. Get them a gift card for their groceries and let her go get them herself, for instance.\n\nAlso, you clearly hate your sil. Like, seething visceral hate, so I can't imagine she's as bad as you're saying.

As this is a long time personality trait, I would suspect a personality disorder.  Which are really hard to deal with.\n\nWhat are your brother and SIL doing to get out of this mess they are in?  How long are you expected to support their entire family?  You're essentially supporting two households.\n\nAs for Christmas, I would do this at your place (even if it is small).  Do the Christmas lunch/dinner that you want and if SIL complains then let it go in one ear and out the other.  She's not funding it, she gets no say.  Your nephews will appreciate whatever you do.  I wouldn't be stumping up any cash for their parents to buy their presents either.  You buy them what you want to, and you give them the presents on Christmas days from you.

You are N A H for wanting to be acknowledged for the amazing thing that you are doing for your nephews.

Host Christmas or don\u2019t. It\u2019s your right to do or not do these things for whatever reason (including your SIL being unappreciative). However, you do not have the right to threaten them to get them to do what you want (i.e., cancelling Christmas unless they apologize) just because you help them financially. This is an AH move. Second, when your SIL called and apologized, you were incredibly ungracious. If you felt that the apology was insincere, remember that you blackmailed them into it. Finally, something about this post indicates that you might be a man. The optics of you telling your SIL that hormones isn\u2019t an excuse to be in a bad mood seems a little condescending, insensitive, and sexiest, particularly to a mother of three boys under 12.", "NTA. Gently tell brother thst he needs to start looking into food stamps, free/reduced school lunch program, and local food pantries.", "NTA sadly, it is very common to help someone and then they get an attitude like that and think that you work for them. They can also demand more and more. You are right to require respect. The issue here, is that there is a lot of your energy tipping the scales in one direction only. Think of it like a see saw rising you higher and higher at great speed with your good deeds, while they sink lower and lower to the ground with their lack of energy exchange. You think good will come to you from the good you have done, instead you could find yourself flying off that see saw and smashing your face into the ground.", "Just want to give you a little encouragement, OP, because it\u2019s clear you want wants best for your nephews and are willing to sacrifice for them. \n\nIt\u2019s super frustrating to take on a parent\u2019s responsibility without receiving any gratitude, much less attitude, from said parent. For what it\u2019s worth, it sounds like she knows she was in the wrong, but is unable to take full responsibility for her actions, so she is blaming her hormones. For some reason, admitting fault even when you know it is hard, and it\u2019s very human to practice avoidance by shifting blame. However, that doesn\u2019t make it right, and I think you see that. By threatening to take away Christmas, I think you may be trying to force her to admit fault and fix her flaws, or at the very least, give you at least a thank you. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t respond appropriately, and so you\u2019re left with resentment which sucks because it makes you not even want to help anymore. What\u2019s worse, is this is probably not the first time this has happened - it\u2019s just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and led you here with us. \n\nSooo\u2026\n1) Remember your purpose, why you\u2019re helping in the first place. \n2) Recognize you may not get the gratitude you deserve, but that that\u2019s ok because you\u2019re doing the right thing for your nephews. \n3) Remind yourself again and again that your own self respect is all the validation you need.\n4) Figure out how to avoid dealing directly with your SIL as much as possible.

Did she even know you were coming then? What would you have done if she had an appointment and wasn\u2019t home?

Are you helping because you want to or because you want to lord it over them?", "Overall NTA, but as others have said, you shouldn't cancel Xmas for your bro and nephews bc of her attitude. Gift cards is a good idea. Also, while you don't like online shopping for you, you can still do it for them. There are a few tricks, if you order to get it first thing in the am you're more likely to get what you want and need. Also, don't spend the whole budget online. Hold a little back just in case necessities don't come and you can go to the store if need be.

Some people have mental illnesses that prevent them from navigating life without help that is way beyond what I can reasonably provide for them.

You were rude by being condescending, rubbing in your help, and wanting her to grovel. Also, yes, women do get grouchy on their periods and  she may not have wanted to come to the door due to cramps too. And when she apologized and explained, you doubled down on being rude to her. Honestly I would rather split pb sandwiches than deal with your nasty condescending attitude. Sounds like you want her to kiss your feet for your help. But given she has kids she has to suck up her pride and grovel to you, and naturally she resents it.", "ESH. Your SIL should be more appreciative but you also escalated things rapidly.
