It's inevitable.\n\nI understand why you don't want to do online grocery shopping, and Im guessing you don't want to give money for groceries because you fear they will spend it on something else, but what about a giftcard for groceries? You can give them four cards a month.", "NTA but don't punish your nephews and your bro for the SIL shitty behaviour. You didn't have to buy their groceries and do all that extra work.

Maybe dial back what you physically do. Get them a gift card for their groceries and let her go get them herself, for instance.\n\nAlso, you clearly hate your sil. Like, seething visceral hate, so I can't imagine she's as bad as you're saying.

As this is a long time personality trait, I would suspect a personality disorder.  Which are really hard to deal with.\n\nWhat are your brother and SIL doing to get out of this mess they are in?  How long are you expected to support their entire family?  You're essentially supporting two households.\n\nAs for Christmas, I would do this at your place (even if it is small).  Do the Christmas lunch/dinner that you want and if SIL complains then let it go in one ear and out the other.  She's not funding it, she gets no say.  Your nephews will appreciate whatever you do.  I wouldn't be stumping up any cash for their parents to buy their presents either.  You buy them what you want to, and you give them the presents on Christmas days from you.  Don't leave it at their place for their parents to change the labels and make it look like you got them nothing.\n\nThey need to look at what sort of welfare support there is for them.

You are N A H for wanting to be acknowledged for the amazing thing that you are doing for your nephews. But, I think that the way you\u2019re behaving after the initial encounter is a bit on the AH side. First, either help them financially or don\u2019t. Buy their groceries or don\u2019t. Host Christmas or don\u2019t. It\u2019s your right to do or not do these things for whatever reason (including your SIL being unappreciative). However, you do not have the right to threaten them to get them to do what you want (i.e., cancelling Christmas unless they apologize) just because you help them financially. This is an AH move. Second, when your SIL called and apologized, you were incredibly ungracious. If you felt that the apology was insincere, remember that you blackmailed them into it. Finally, something about this post indicates that you might be a man. The optics of you telling your SIL that hormones isn\u2019t an excuse to be in a bad mood seems a little condescending, insensitive, and sexiest, particularly to a mother of three boys under 12.", "NTA. Gently tell brother thst he needs to start looking into food stamps, free/reduced school lunch program, and local food pantries.", "NTA sadly, it is very common to help someone and then they get an attitude like that and think that you work for them. They can also demand more and more. You are right to require respect. The issue here, is that there is a lot of your energy tipping the scales in one direction only. Think of it like a see saw rising you higher and higher at great speed with your good deeds, while they sink lower and lower to the ground with their lack of energy exchange. You think good will come to you from the good you have done, instead you could find yourself flying off that see saw and smashing your face into the ground.", "Just want to give you a little encouragement, OP, because it\u2019s clear you want wants best for your nephews and are willing to sacrifice for them. \n\nIt\u2019s super frustrating to take on a parent\u2019s responsibility without receiving any gratitude, much less attitude, from said parent. For what it\u2019s worth, it sounds like she knows she was in the wrong, but is unable to take full responsibility for her actions, so she is blaming her hormones. For some reason, admitting fault even when you know it is hard, and it\u2019s very human to practice avoidance by shifting blame. However, that doesn\u2019t make it right, and I think you see that. By threatening to take away Christmas, I think you may be trying to force her to admit fault and fix her flaws, or at the very least, give you at least a thank you. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t respond appropriately, and so you\u2019re left with resentment which sucks because it makes you not even want to help anymore. What\u2019s worse, is this is probably not the first time this has happened - it\u2019s just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and led you here with us. \n\nSooo\u2026\n1) Remember your purpose, why you\u2019re helping in the first place. \n2) Recognize you may not get the gratitude you deserve, but that that\u2019s ok because you\u2019re doing the right thing for your nephews. \n3) Remind yourself again and again that your own self respect is all the validation you need.\n4) Figure out how to avoid dealing directly with your SIL as much as possible. Idk of another cure for resentment other than time, so she\u2019s gonna trigger you. I liked the idea of giving them a grocery gift card as an example. \n\nBest of luck! You\u2019ve got this!", "YTA. You have NO idea why she couldn\u2019t come to the door and just made an assumption based on what is your very clear existing dislike for her. She could\u2019ve easily been in the middle of something she couldn\u2019t step away from, in the restroom, having an emotional moment over her dire situation, etc. You just automatically assumed the worst when she didn\u2019t jump immediately. Did she even know you were coming then? What would you have done if she had an appointment and wasn\u2019t home? It\u2019s clear you\u2019ve over extended yourself, with some of that being by choice, and it\u2019s taking a toll. Are you helping because you want to or because you want to lord it over them?", "Overall NTA, but as others have said, you shouldn't cancel Xmas for your bro and nephews bc of her attitude. Gift cards is a good idea. Also, while you don't like online shopping for you, you can still do it for them. There are a few tricks, if you order to get it first thing in the am you're more likely to get what you want and need. Also, don't spend the whole budget online. Hold a little back just in case necessities don't come and you can go to the store if need be. Or, you have something that you can either send a smaller order sometime later I'm the week, or.use it to treat your nephews to something  that you share with them", "Talk about biting the hand that feeds you", "I think we all need to step back from this \u201chormones\u201d argument. This was an apology she was forced to make. It\u2019s not genuine because frankly it didn\u2019t need to be made that way. OP went from 0-60 in a way that primary affects the kids. Mom made the apology for the kids. Hormones is just an easy out for an apology you\u2019ve been backed into.", "She is bad as he is saying. A person who has nothing to eat and it's being helped by a family member and acts this entitled is bad. \nHormones are no excuse to bite the hand that feeds you. Or to be an AH with people in general.", "OP can cancel Christmas cause OP was probably the one hosting it. Why put people who have no gratitude towards you in your home.", "Social media is important to her.", "Point out where I said the behavior was acceptable. I'll wait.\n\nOPs question was if they were ta for *canceling Christmas* not if they were ta for being mad at SIL.", "We have absolutely no way of knowing why she couldn\u2019t come to the door that second and neither does OP. All we have is his assumption and a post that is dripping in resentment for his SIL. From the scant details and OPs overall attitude I very much doubt this is an accurate description.", "I felt some familiar resonance from this as well, as I often step up to help in extra ways as a volunteer extension of my work (church/charity that helps vulnerable people with material needs).  Some people will never stop asking for rides or other favors once they learn I'm the type of person who has trouble saying no.  Some people have mental illnesses that prevent them from navigating life without help that is way beyond what I can reasonably provide for them.  Boundary-setting is super important in situations like these.\n\nOP shouldn't \"cancel Christmas\" for the children's sake, but he should--when the air has cleared--sit down with his brother and SIL and tell them they need to have a sustainable plan by X date, because OP cannot carry them in the long term.", "This op- you're still helping them but you're not oversubscribing yourself. It sets a good boundary too, which will protect yourself mentally!", "Oh I read it wrong sorry. I read as you were telling OP that he saying that hormones are not an excuse was an AH move from him.", "An excuse; no. \nA reason, sure. But any reason for treating someone poorly should be accompanied by an apology for the bad behavior."]}
