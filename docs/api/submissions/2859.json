For all my previous birthdays, I've had to do what my family wanted me to do, but this birthday, I finally got to plan my own party, and I went a bit overboard with it. I had really been wanting to go to this aesthetic Bistro in the town for a long time, and decided that I would finally go this time around with my friends. One of my friends (we'll call her Alison) is a strict vegetarian, and does not eat anything in a restaurant that serves meat, due to religious reasons. She does not eat at my place either, so every time she's over, I order food for her from an exclusively vegetarian restaurant. I always accomodate her wishes. I presented her with two alternatives: She could accompany us on my birthday if she wanted to, have some drinks and I'd treat her later to food from a vegetarian restaurant. Or if she'd rather not come along, I could just meet her later and treat her. \n\nWell, to this, Alison told me that she'd rather us all just go to an exclusive vegetarian place and asked me to pick one. I told her that I had been wanting to go to this Bistro for a long time and wanted to celebrate my birthday there, but she told me that I should take her religious choices into consideration. We went back and forth about this before she agreed to let it go and come with for the celebration. \n\nOn the day of, everything went wrong. Alison would not stop making comments about me. I was wearing this cut out dress that was tight on the hips, and she kept telling me to go change the whole time because the dress \"wasn't meant for my body type\". At the restaurant, Alison kept discussing her life loudly, and whenever someone tried to talk about anything else, she'd end up diverting the topic to herself. She even kept asking my boyfriend if she looked pretty, and at one point, she grabbed his hand, and compared it to hers, exclaiming that hers was very small. I somehow stayed composed and let her comments pass, but couldn't anymore when she asked me if she could borrow my dress sometime, adding how much better it would fit her body. I excused myself to the washroom, because I was close to tears. When I came back, my best friend and boyfriend were arguing with her, asking her to leave. Alison turns to me, and asks me if I wanted her to go. I told her I did. She started crying and told me that I was being a bitch. She said she wanted me to feel how disincluded she felt when I didn't choose a vegetarian restaurant and that is why she was being mean all evening. I still told her she needed to go, and she did. \n\nI know what she did was messed up, but I've been feeling torn about my decision. I don't know if I should have chosen an exclusive veg restaurant for her, or if I should have talked to her instead of throwing her out, now that I know that she was being mean because she felt disincluded. She's pretty angry, and it's gotten a bit ugly and I don't know who is in the wrong anymore. \n\nAita?\n\nEDIT: For those of you asking why I offered to treat Alison/other friends, it is common in my culture for the person whose birthday it is to throw the party. It is not because I'm being generous, everyone here throws their own party or their family does and it's paid for either by the family of the birthday boy/girl or the person themselves.", "created_utc": 1669016719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0sy64/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_birthday/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd cut her off and forget her. She's nasty.", "NTA. \nIt was your birthday and she had zero right to try and tell you where to go. First red flag. \nFor her to make comments about your body?
