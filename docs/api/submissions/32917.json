Colden is a good kid, he plays baseball, is an A student and is a sweet boy. I also know that him and his friends call each other out when they do something bad, he\u2019s told me stories about how him and his friends called out one of their friends for saying something transphobic, they do this by roasting each other sometimes, but it encourages good behavior. Colden sometimes goes to my husband and I for advice, a few months ago, he came to us after his friends \u201croasted\u201d him for a racially insensitive comment he made, you could tell he was remorseful. We live in a very privileged area and it can be hard to see biases. The boys Colden plays baseball with have shaped him into a phenomenal young man.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday night, Colden and Krystiana were in her room together, my husband and I were on the porch watching Liam and Sarah play in the yard. Suddenly, we are interrupted by Colden storming out of the house, and he was walking angrily. We tried to stop him since he didn\u2019t have a coat and was wearing shorts. We told him to come inside and asked what was wrong. He kept walking for a bit, before turning back, walked in our house shivering and asked for some hot cocoa.\r  \n\r  \nHe told us that there was this boy in their grade who Colden found out that Kyrstiana was bullying. He said the boy was a feminine straight guy, he has short hair and doesn\u2019t dress feminine, but he\u2019s a Swiftie, is openly emotional, and he listed a few other things about him. He said our daughter was calling this boy gay and telling his girlfriend that he\u2019s \u201cprobably cheating on her with a boy\u201d. He said he doesn\u2019t know the boy well but it bugged him that she was doing this. He said he didn\u2019t want to report our daughter though as he didn\u2019t want to ruin his relationship with her.\r  \n\r  \nWe suggested to him that he considered reporting it, but he said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing so. Once he had calmed down, we let him watch TV in the living room while we talked to our daughter. She was unapologetic, she said that she was just stating how she felt and that we couldn\u2019t punish her for that. We told her that she was grounded and took her devices away.\r  \n\r  \nAfter cooling down a bit ourselves, my husband and I discussed our plans and we decided to email the principals and admin at her school. \r  \n\r  \nThe school is currently investigating this further, but has already found evidence that her and her entire friend group was bullying this boy after just a day of looking, and she\u2019s facing serious consequences. \r  \n\r  \nOur daughter said we were being \u201csnitches\u201d and said that we are \u201cruining her social life\u201d.

You create a monster child, refuse to take responsibility, and then want to dump it all on the school. \n\nLike punish her first and see if it works.

This could impact her negatively in college and in her career, and that\u2019s not even touching the complete lack of empathy she is demonstrating.  Somehow she deciding mirroring her social groups was more important than being a decent human being.  Maybe sometime without her privilege, with repercussions both at school AND at home will help mend her ways.  My daughter went through that at a younger age, so it was easier to manage.", "NTA. You did the right thing to help the kid. The school needs to be aware of what's happening so they can do something to stop it.\n\nI'm curious whether this is a new issue for your daughter though? Are you surprised by her behaviour?", "NTA\n\nIt's cute the way she is complaining that you are ruining her social life when she's totally cool with making the poor boy's life a living hell.", "NTA\n\nyou are doing a loving and compassionate thing for your daughter.", "NTA. Words mean something, OP. And you\u2019re teaching  K that hers have consequences.

Not a lot of parents would do that, and it shows how much you love your own child to stop her . Good job, OP.", "NTA. Your daughter is learning that her choices have consequences.  You aren't ruining her social life, she is. She actively chose to bully someone she feels is weaker than her. You were right for notifying the school. What if God forbid, this never got reported, and the bullying continued and this boy tried to hurt himself, or worse, succeeded?  Your daughter is learning important life lessons in a secure, controlled environment so that she doesn't make these mistakes or worse ones when she's an adult, and you can't protect her.", "NTA, your daughter is a bully and you guys are just parenting her. School found evidence of her bullying anyway. This is a good lesson for her.", "NTA. Your daughter is ruining her life, not you. You are just making sure that she meets the well-deserved consequences of her own actions. I applaud you.", "NTA Hurrah this is what GOOD parenting looks like. None of this 'my angel wouldnt do this' crap you normally see nowadays", "NTA You are fantastic parents and should be commended for holding your child accountable. This doesn't happen enough.", "You're doing a great job, OP. Keep it up. It's hard, but she has to learn her actions have consequences.", "NTA.  Thank you for standing up for this child.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing.  Be cautious, though,  in how you continue forward. \n\nDid you tell your daughter you were going to report her? Have you scheduled therapy for her,  if possible? Are you listening to her side of the story and pointing out where she made poor choices?\n\nYour description of your 13 YO's boyfriend is glowing!! You're so proud of him, and apparently, he can do no wrong. In this situation,  yes.  Don't compare your daughter to her boyfriend and his friends. This is a really tough point, as you might be about to severely stunt your daughter's trust in you depending on how you move forward.  Engage a therapist if possible to help you navigate so that she knows she can still come to you for help and support. \n\n There's no question that what she did was wrong and dangerous! It's never ok to bully people.  Generally though,  people who bully usually have an underlying reason.  Maybe it's her friends, maybe something else is going on.  Please don't shut down your communication lines because you're disappointed in her.  Don't praise her (ex?) Boyfriend's choices and actions to her or in her hearing (at least not yet).  Don't compare her to him or her friends to his. Talk to her about why she's making these choices and listen. Don't dismiss things as petty pre-teen stuff,  even if it is.  Talk her through why it wasn't a good decision.  Help her understand the consequences through education,  authoritative (not authoritarian) actions, classes, volunteer work,  stuff like that. \n\nMy parents always compared me to my friends when I made bad choices. They always laid down the strictest punishments possible, but never talked to me about why I did what I did,  or they dismissed it as stupid.  It might have been stupid, but I didn't think so at the time.  The end result of all this: I don't make friends easily, I never have/ never will reach out to my parents in times of crisis, and I learned how to lie to them really well.

You did the right thing.", "No, you are not the AH. The right thing to do is not always easy or convenient, but it is the right thing to do. That poor boy should feel safe in school and I bet he wasn\u2019t feeling safe at all. Good for you for standing up for what is right. Also, your daughter doesn\u2019t know what people can be capable of when pushed to their limits, that boy could hurt himself, or one day she could potentially bully someone and they would hurt her. She had no idea what she is doing and it\u2019s good you are stepping in. I would have also told her to find new friends, and if getting an allowance, donate it to an LGBTQ charity until you felt she truly understood what she did was wrong.", "NTA because you're teaching her a lesson. To be respectful and understanding of people and that actions have consequences. \n\nThat boy might well be gay, but still being young he might not have accepted it yet and is really struggling. Her and her friends could spiral him into a depression, maybe worse. Even if he wasn't gay, it still wouldn't make any difference because the behaviour is still unacceptable. \n\nColden and his friends sound like good lads.

Needs alot more than a slap on the wrist or a nip in the bud.", "Nta you are being the best parent out here. You let her know that what she is doing it not something you will let slide. You told her is two little actions that her actions have consequences.", "NTA \nYour daughter needs to learn that her \u2018social life\u2019 shouldn\u2019t involve bullying other kids and that bullying is wrong and has consequences.

Honestly you guys are doing some great parenting & teaching her a valuable lesson.", "A+ Parenting there.  Hold her accountable for her actions...also, I'd ask her if her social life is only about bullying and hurting people?  Does she like being a lemming? Just following along?", "NTA.  \n\nYour daughter ruined her own social life, and is facing consequences for her actions, *as she should*.\n\nThe damage to her victim can't be undone, but seeing the system work, even just a little, is much better than the alternative.", "NTA. Good parenting.", "NTA. It\u2019s alarming that your daughter got to this age without realizing she was a bully and homophobe, but it can happen. It\u2019s amazing and good that you are attacking this from all angles - home AND school. You don\u2019t personally have control over what happens at school, so this is a great idea and will really help the poor kid being bullied. \n\nGood job, and thank you. Hopefully your daughter will learn an important lesson - that bigotry will NOT get you anywhere good in life.", "NTA. Kids commit suicide from bullying- this was the best thing for that boy. Also, your daughter needed a come to Jesus moment.", "NTA. Thank you for not being the type of parents who look the other way. Bullying is one of the main reasons the suicide rate is so high.", "NTA. You are parents, and did something that most would not do. You called your daughter on her behavior, and when she admitted it and would not relent you took it further.  \n\n\nShe is 13 and is learning lessons now that will stick with her for years. If getting called out for bullying is creating social problems for her, those are not the kind of friends that she needs.", "You're not the asshole\n\nIf that boy is feminine, it's his business. I helped raise my stepdaughter's halfbrother thru my first marriage. \nHe is a wonderful and sweet person. He did turn out to be gay...and he struggled with his identity thru his teens, he tried to be straight, but he'd also grown up from a very young age(2-8) watching his stepdad beat up his mom before she's finally divorced him. Our past trauma can affect who we are in a serious way, I know a few whose childhood was spent watching the very same abuse which led to the same choice.\nI was a pillar of support for him when he finally came forward bcuz his whole religious family initially rejected him. He didn't deserve to be outed by people who were supposed to love him. He hadn't changed at all, just finally told everyone how he felt and wanted to be accepted and still loved. His sister came to me the day he told them, crying saying mom I have something to tell u about Ty and it's bad ...\nWhen she told me, I hugged her and told her he's the same brother she had a week ago and that nothing has really changed about him. He just finally told all of them the truth I'd always known and not spoken of since the first time I'd met him. She asked how I knew. I have a cousin that's 2weeks older than myself that was exactly the same way he was. Feminine manners and all.\nI didn't judge him either.\n\nShe shouldn't shame anyone for their sexuality or anything else really. We're all out here just trying to survive the best we can and we're trying to make the most of our lives. She also doesn't have any clue what his eyes have seen. She needs to leave him alone if she can't be kind.\n\nI applaud you for standing up and making your daughter understand the wrong in her actions. If you did nothing then she would continue to make his life harder than it needs to be. It would also not stop with just him.\nYou did the right thing", "NTA\n\n   Kudos to you and your spouse for being responsible humans and not burying your head in the sand, pulling the \" my child could never\" card.

I am a little concerned about Krystiana's character... she sounds like a mean girl and I hope she sees it and grows out of it.", "NTA - your daughter needs to learn a valuable lesson here: bullying in any form isn't cool. It's especially not cool when you are doing it to stay relevant with your peers. \n\nYou got to nip this in the bud and you are doing just that.

And good on you for not coddling your daughter and showing Colden the respect he deserves", "NTA.  You need to somehow teach your daughter how disseminating this kind of hatred leads to kids dying, either by suicide or being murdered (think of the gay kid Matthew Shepherd in Wyoming), and can really damage people.  Try to get her to see how much it would hurt her if she were being bullied for being different in some way.  Tell her you expect her to treat everyone with decency and kindness, and that she needs to reach out to and befriend kids who are different, rather than bully them.  Get her completely off social media.  Tell the parents of her friends that this has been going on.  Monitor her closely.", "NTA.  What were you supposed to do - let this keep happening until the poor kid committed suicide over it?\n\nI see too many examples of parents excusing away their kids' behavior.

Teaching kids that there are consequences for their actions is the best lesson you can give them.", "NTA. She's right, you can't punish her for her feelings. HOWEVER, you can and should punish her for how she chose to express those feelings. The lesson she needs to learn is that if she feels like a hateful bitchy little bigot, then she needs to stay silent. It's inappropriate to act like a hateful bitchy little bigot. Kudos to your son, it sounds like he's a good lil chap.\n\nMaybe have your daughter see one of those documentaries on how bullying makes kids commit suicide? Show her that her actions have real consequences beyond disturbing her home family life.
