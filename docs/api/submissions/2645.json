Everyone but you was unprofessional and disrespectful and their comment that you were is something to report", "Sweet jeebus, she was using *rhetoric* on you and you jumped to a personal assassination of her character. She was attempting to build rapport by shared annoyances and experiences, and yes, get you to agree since that would be the easiest for the business. Rather than having either no coverage or paying to bring in coverage. Because that's her job.\n\nThere were other, better paths to take. Such as negotiating for your 40 hours back in exchange for one or two weeks of in-office coverage for the year, and getting that set in stone. You only survived because your boss likes your work. But you did put yourself in a vulnerable position that you'll be on your own if they ever stop liking your work.\n\nNAH but you were abrasive and pretty rude.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIts unprofessional to pass something off like its the truth.

Nothing in your posts suggests she was lying but you went straight to character assassination. She didn\u2019t have to fight for a WFH policy that you do benefit from. And depending on your senior leadership attitudes she\u2019s likely had to fight pretty hard for that policy and make compromises so it was more palatable for senior leadership. It seems like in most Companies HR follows the \u201cdo what I say and not what I do\u201d philosophy so I don\u2019t necessarily believe it was entirely self-serving, because I\u2019d bet money her WFH arrangement would have happened regardless of whether or not there was a policy in place for the rest of you. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t realize that HR could have been your ally in regards to dealing with your \u201clazy\u201d coworkers or being able to use your PTO more often. Your shot yourself in the foot because you can bet HR isn\u2019t going to fight for you now should anything happen in the future.\n\nAs an aside, being a loyal and hard worker doesn\u2019t pay off as much if you can\u2019t play nice in the sandbox.", "NTA\n\nYou probably could have couched your language better while making the same point though, I say this not for the sake of HR's poor little ears but for your own sake. It's better to not give them instances to use against you if you can avoid it. While \"dishonest\" might have been overly blunt, perhaps you could still have pointed out that she benefitted from the WFH policy without the targetted personal attack, if you still felt the need to point out she was acting like you owed her language like \"I feel\" works wonders in these settings. \"I feel as if you're implying I owe you my cooperation now which just isn't right, I understand you're not my enemy, but I would appreciate *your* understanding regarding the blatant unfairness of this scheduling. I am losing 40+ hours of PTO every year to be able to WFH, that was the deal and I was happy with it, but now I'm expected to lose the WFH schedule I sacrificed my PTO for? That's just not acceptable. Rationally speaking, I feel this is a ridiculous expectation to place on my shoulders alone, don't you?\" That kind of thing. Alienating the mediator even if they're being unreasonable is a bad tactic, even if you refuse to give the mediator any ground, do so as politely as you can for your own benefit.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t think the policy is WFH = no PTO (that would be illegal where I\u2019m from anyways). I think OP\u2019s position is one approved for WFH but the workload means OP doesn\u2019t get time off approved by the boss because they\u2019re needed to complete the high workload.", "I don\u2019t understand how you have to lose out on PTO just because you work from home.  Also, employers who claim WFH is such a huge \u201cgift\u201d to employees are lying.   It benefits THEM- people who work from home are more likely to work through illness or bad weather or school closures instead of calling in.  They\u2019re more likely to clock in on the weekends for an extra few hours, or stay a bit later.  WFH benefits most businesses or they wouldn\u2019t offer it!", "I had HR of a large corporation try to illegally reduce my pay retroactively because the CFO suddenly decided I was being paid too much. It was great.", "This. The way OP talks about every other person in this story is unnecessarily rude and belligerent. They may not be technically wrong in this one situation, but if this is typical of their behavior at work, they\u2019re not going to have a job much longer. In fact, *not* disciplining or firing someone who treats their coworkers like that is one of the fastest ways to kill their entire department\u2019s (or company\u2019s) morale.\n\nUnless OP\u2019s dad owns the company, I\u2019d start job hunting pronto (and plan to be a hell of a lot nicer to people at the new place).

In addition to wage theft, it's also tax fraud. \n\nI've never had my wages cut, probably because I made it clear I'd immediately leave if they did so without corresponding compensation. Eg working proportional less hours or corresponding more number of vacation days.", "This was many years ago. I called the Department of Labor and got blown off. The lady didn't have a clue what I was talking about and just kept repeating that they could change my pay at any time, not realizing it was for time I already worked. I gave up with them and mentioned offhand that it was probably illegal to HR the next time we talked and negotiated them dropping my pay from $18/hr to $10/hr up to $12/hr. I'm pretty sure it was a whole \"women's work is worthless\" kind of thing, but it was a summer job.", "Whoa. They wanted to cut your pay essentially in half? That's a walk out the door offer, not a negotiating starting point."]}
