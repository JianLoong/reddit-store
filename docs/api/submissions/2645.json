Outside of sheer laziness, there was no reason why they can work during normal business hours if one is out.\n\nI'm pretty self-sufficient working by myself. My coworkers tried running some scam on me where they had planned a total of seven weeks off between them and had the expectation that I'd come into the office to help \"cover.\" I refused. They are in charge of the office not me. WFH is the only reason why I don't raise Hell over the fact that I can't take more than a few days off a year. I am NOT budging on that for two lazy people.\n\nThey got mad at me and complained to HR who wanted to do a Zoom and try to meditate. The meeting was me, my two coworkers and two HR people. \n\nBasically one of the HR people tried to shame me into helping cover the office by saying how she fought for the very same WFH policy that I benefit from. She said she didn't have to do it the same way I don't have to provide coverage but she's a team player \n\nI told her she was being dishonest. She gasped. I pointed out that she benefitted from the WFH policy so stop acting like she did it out of pure altruism. She didn't. She had an self-serving interest. This, I don't \"owe\" her anything, let alone my \"team.\"\n\nLike I said, I'm fine losing 40+ hours of PTO every year to be able to WFH. I'm not fine losing 40+ hours of PTO AND losing my WFH schedule so other people don't have to do their job or figure out their own problems.\n\nAt the end, HR gave my coworkers some schedule unrelated to me.

WFH was not a gift, you literally had to give something away which is ur PTO days. So why would you do that and then come in as well. I was had requested that each time you was made to come in be equal to a PTO day. So seven weeks off, for them will give you and just you seven weeks off.", "NTA for shutting that shit down. The hr chick was attempting to guilt trip you. That's so gross.", "NTA Is it any coincidence that one finds HR people to often be the most incompetent, self serving individuals at many companies? I say this as someone who has worked as a freelancer doing corporate events for many years and have worked many an event dealing with HR departments and seeing firsthand their disfunctionality. They often cause more problems than they solve.", "NTA.  Working in HR doesn't automatically make one a better person or better coworker and I'm personnally sick to death of HR folks who think that whatever they say should be taken as the only truth simply because it is coming out of an HR employee's mouth.  Good for you for pointing out her hypocrisy.", "NTA. What you said was a fact. This is the kind of statement where wording and tone matter, though. Did you say it rudely, or neutrally? If you said it without attitude, you did nothing wrong - and I'm guessing that's why your boss had your back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
