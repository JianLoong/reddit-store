{"id": 34386, "submission_id": "18zbsy8", "title": "AITA for not defending MIL after she kept saying my daughter looks nothing like me?", "selftext": "I'm not sure what crawled up my MILs ass but her and I got along so well before I got pregnant. She called me her daughter, came over to see me all the time, called me randomly to just talk, told me she loves me all the time, etc. But after I got pregnant, something switched in her. She stopped calling. She never said \"I love you\" back when I said it. She only came over to see my husband and 9 times out of 10, it was trying to get him out of the house to go with her. Barely gives me a hello/goodbye in passing. She even tried staying in the labor and delivery room after she was already told no because \"her baby needs support\", and clung to my husbands arm- several times trying to get him to go sit on the couch with her instead of standing by me where he was (she was kicked out by nurses).\n\nSince I had my daughter 3 months ago she has come over a good 10-15 times and has literally only held my kid twice. She just follows my husband around everywhere and still tries to get him to leave with her to go do chores/tasks for her (changing tires, changing oil, fixing her computer, moving around her house, etc etc etc). And honestly none of that bothers me nearly as much as her comments about how my daughter looks nothing like me and looks exactly like HER and my husband. For a bit of context, my husband looks nothing like his mom. He is a spitting image of his father. His mom is short, blonde, brown eyes. He is super tall, black hair, green eyes. You can't tell they are related at all. But she insists my daughter looks just like her and my husband and nothing like me. She's made these comments more times than I can count and I just give a \"yeah okay Becky\" and leave it.\n\nBut yesterday I hosted a dinner for the family and obviously invited her. She shows up with a scrapbook album with a bunch of photos of her and my husband from birth to present. She was showing/telling everyone who would listen that my daughter was \"basically not even mine if you go off of looks\". My husband spoke up a few times with a clipped \"she actually looks just like my wife\" but his mom didn't acknowledge him. But then she got to my mom and my mom, being a \"no bullshit\" woman, said \"Are you blind or are you just being ignorant? That girl looks just like my daughter and nothing like you. Kinda weird to me that you are desperately pushing the narrative that the baby looks like your son AND you considering your son looks nothing like you either.\" No one in the house said anything but a few of them were chuckling. My husband also didn't say anything but he looked more like a deer in headlights than anything. My MIL then left. She group texted my husband and I later on saying she will never forgive us for not defending her against my mom \"making a scene and embarrassing her in front of everyone.\" I don't feel bad. My husband does. AITA?\n\nETA: She has 4 kids. My husband is the youngest (he's 27). Her two daughters have 1 child each, both 12yo girls. Her other son has 5 kids. She takes her daughters kids once a month. She has never made a conscious effort with any of her other sons kids, outside of his oldest (9f). She doesn't act like this with her other kids at all. She acts uninterested all together. Ages: (not sure if it's relevant) MIL is 61. My mom is 44. My husband and I are both 27.

Your mom called a spade a spade. If you would have done anything, she would have gaslit the hell out of you. However, having your mother, basically her peer, call her out in front of everything, holding back none of the niceties, either you or your husband would have had, put your MIL in her place.   \nJust look, she can't even call your mother out, because she knows she would not hold back and has no reason to continue to have a good relationship with her, however, you and your husband do. So, she blames the both of you, probably really you for not defending her craziness. \n\nIn her defense, a really small defense, it must have been hard having a son that looked nothing like her. So, in a way, this was a do over, where she could have a piece of her in your child. However, it really made no sense, because she tried to loop her son into it, where he looks nothing like her.

The first thing she said when she visited my son at the hospital was \"he's got our family's hair\" - although that kid was mostly bald at first. My daughter who is my spitting image of course looks EXACTLY like her. Then, everything my children did of course came from her side of the family. I mean, I am a professional musician and all my kids play instruments, but of course they only have this talent because her second grade cousin played the piano for a year in elementary school. I love building Lego with my kids and we've designed and built so many things together, but they only enjoy that because SHE bought my husband a small Lego set when he was nine. My children love cooking and baking with me but that has to be because her brother has a bakery. The list goes on (and on and on)\n\nWhenever my husband and I had plans to do something alone with the kids, she had a serious emergency. Once she fabricated a story that my husband's grandmother was dying and he had to come ASAP because the priest was already there and prayed for her and she'll be dying any minute. Spoiler alert, she only had a light cold, there was no priest and she went to live on three more years. But my husband was completely shaken at the prospect that his beloved grandmother could be dying and it took a long time for him to believe that his mother had done this on purpose.\n\nWe had to go very low contact for a long while and have only recently started to include her again.

That may add to her insecurities as she probably feels she \"lost\" her baby to his new family. And absolutely tickled that your mom spoke out too! That's not ok.

MIL sounds like she has multiple narcissistic traits. \n\nNarcs are big on neglect of their kids but target one to be their golden child. They also only see value in people they can use in some way, so that's who they focus their attention upon. When they no longer get whatever they want from somebody, they drop them quickly, like she did with you.\n\nNarcs are also big on triangulating family members against one another, control, denial, manipulation and delusions. They're easily threatened by someone else getting attention (your husband loving his baby). They also like to play a game called DARVO (deny, attack then reverse victim and offender). So before the party and then at the party, she tried to minimize you as your child's mother (over and over again). When it didn't work and she got called out on it, she suddenly became \"the victim.\" *Wrong*. \n\nAttacking you - subtly or otherwise - makes her the aggressor, not the victim. Then, she goes on to threaten you via text to preemptively get the jump on your emotions, control the situation to her favor and further pit herself as the victim. \n\nReally, she's a master class in narcissism. \n\nDon't let her manipulate you. You two did nothing wrong. She needed to be called out and held accountable for her actions. No one should defend what she did to you and your baby. Brava to your mom!\n\nYour husband acting like a deer in headlights seems to be a flight-fight-fawn-or-freeze response. She's likely traumatized him and manipulated him throughout his life (as well as his siblings), and he may not even been aware of it because narcs are so **insidious** and can be very covert. That's probably why he feels badly now: She has conditioned him to react that way to her whims (she wants him to be controllable).\n\nNarcs mess with your mind and it's rough/confusing/painful to deal with. Many children of narcs end up going low or no contact with the parent who's disordered, because they don't improve. They don't change. They worsen as they get older.

So can you talk to me about that?\u201d \n\nIf she interrupts, just calmly re-interrupt, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but can you please let me say this? It\u2019s really important to me.\u201d \n\nIf you say this, or a version of this with your real, raw emotion, lovingly, genuinely, and vulnerably, I think this will be a momentous move forward to moving past this current situation and improving your relationship as a whole moving forward and it sets the stage for future conversations like this if they need to be had.", "Yeah, those hippies are known for keeping their lips tight when it comes to expressing their inner thoughts. Yes, that is sarcasm.", "Inaccurate generalization - MILs age is never mentioned to determine her \u2018generation\u2019.  Also, OPs Mom certainly had no prob communicating.", "> I'll never understand all this ownership over who a baby looks more like.\n\nIt usually comes from a need to feel connected.

I never would have mentioned that if you hadn't said the last sentence. She had him until he was 8 and then gave custody to her eldest daughter. She saw him for holidays and birthdays until he was roughly 16, when she came back around more often. He lived with his sister from age 8 to 22, when we got our house together.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to the time that my kids are fully adult and have caring partners.

[Eye color is a lot more complicated than we used to think](https://www.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/articles/2009/ask332/)\u2026 there are at least eight different genes that affect color, including some that interact with each other. So it\u2019s completely possible for parents with pretty much any eye color to end up with a child with eye color that is completely different than their own (that\u2019s why while extremely rare two blue eyed parents can actually have a brown eyed child).", "God, that would be a hilarious twist", "No, that's the weird thing.

Like, have they ever looked at my face? Do they see me right now?? The answer to that is apparently no, they do not see you or anything about you. I\u2019ve endured baby/kid pics of my FIL and my husband that bear little to no resemblance to prove they are \u201ctwins.\u201d The funny thing is now that he is older, he has several of his father\u2019s traits and looks more like a mix of us and *now* she will remark how much he looks like me.

Now he looks like me)", "The similarity is astonishing!", "My oldest daughter is an even split between my husband and I, so much so that she\u2019s constantly called my mini me. But until she was at least a year old she looked nothing like me other than the shape of her eyes (she got the size of them from my husband as well as his very thick lashes). It\u2019s entirely likely that by two she\u2019ll strongly resemble both of you.", "When I was a kid all the way up through my late teens I looked just like my dad. Like copy pasted his face and just swapped the gender. I\u2019m now in my late 20s and got a haircut and every time I look in the mirror I just see my mom.

I usually see these weird Electra type posts and think these grandmas are so weird, but this makes a lot of sense!", "I guess people from her generation grew up thinking their elders were untouchable, regardless of their behavior. Granny could be mean, homophobic, disrespectful, rude or passive aggressive and nobody would dream of uninviting them for Christmas, talking back, setting boundaries or cutting contact. Not all of them were like that of course, but there was a general notion that old age came with a lot of free passes for bad behavior. And now that she\u2019s reaching/reached that age, she probably expects this kind of grace, but the newer generations are not having it.", "Honestly I appreciate comments like this because I\u2019m worried this will be me when my daughter is an adult, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how to fix it now. My daughter and I have been through a lot together, and we\u2019ve bonded a lot through mutual struggle and trauma, which has made us a bit codependent on each other. She also has special needs and needs me a lot more than most kids need their moms at her age. My daughter is 11 now and is my little shadow. We do everything together.  Our therapist is telling me not to worry too much about the codependency and to meet my daughter\u2019s needs day by day and she\u2019ll launch when she\u2019s ready, but I worry a lot about how I will cope once she starts building her own life and pushing for independence because so much of my life revolves around her.", "No, she wasn't. She didn't even want to be. Her daughters both wanted her in the delivery room and she said no (she had to work). Her oldest son asked that she be in the room for his first 2 babies and she said yes but never showed up. So she didn't make any effort with her other kids.", "This isn\u2019t a generation thing at all, disagree with all this advice. MIL is a toxic covert narcissist who will continually \u2018push boundaries\u2019 aka emotionally target and sideline this parent.

What do his siblings think about all this?", "You didn't read what I said. I said whether she was coping well or not wasn't on you which was why I said NTA, even in the best possible light. It is 100% the case that she is not coping well (again, not on you) and all parents should want to have their children succeed. I was presuming that you would also want your child(ren) to succeed.
