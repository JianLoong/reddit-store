{"id": 34386, "submission_id": "18zbsy8", "title": "AITA for not defending MIL after she kept saying my daughter looks nothing like me?", "selftext": "I'm not sure what crawled up my MILs ass but her and I got along so well before I got pregnant. She called me her daughter, came over to see me all the time, called me randomly to just talk, told me she loves me all the time, etc. But after I got pregnant, something switched in her. She stopped calling. She never said \"I love you\" back when I said it. She only came over to see my husband and 9 times out of 10, it was trying to get him out of the house to go with her. Barely gives me a hello/goodbye in passing. She even tried staying in the labor and delivery room after she was already told no because \"her baby needs support\", and clung to my husbands arm- several times trying to get him to go sit on the couch with her instead of standing by me where he was (she was kicked out by nurses).\n\nSince I had my daughter 3 months ago she has come over a good 10-15 times and has literally only held my kid twice. She just follows my husband around everywhere and still tries to get him to leave with her to go do chores/tasks for her (changing tires, changing oil, fixing her computer, moving around her house, etc etc etc). And honestly none of that bothers me nearly as much as her comments about how my daughter looks nothing like me and looks exactly like HER and my husband. For a bit of context, my husband looks nothing like his mom. He is a spitting image of his father. His mom is short, blonde, brown eyes. He is super tall, black hair, green eyes. You can't tell they are related at all. But she insists my daughter looks just like her and my husband and nothing like me. She's made these comments more times than I can count and I just give a \"yeah okay Becky\" and leave it.\n\nBut yesterday I hosted a dinner for the family and obviously invited her. She shows up with a scrapbook album with a bunch of photos of her and my husband from birth to present. She was showing/telling everyone who would listen that my daughter was \"basically not even mine if you go off of looks\". My husband spoke up a few times with a clipped \"she actually looks just like my wife\" but his mom didn't acknowledge him. But then she got to my mom and my mom, being a \"no bullshit\" woman, said \"Are you blind or are you just being ignorant? That girl looks just like my daughter and nothing like you. Kinda weird to me that you are desperately pushing the narrative that the baby looks like your son AND you considering your son looks nothing like you either.\" No one in the house said anything but a few of them were chuckling. My husband also didn't say anything but he looked more like a deer in headlights than anything. My MIL then left. She group texted my husband and I later on saying she will never forgive us for not defending her against my mom \"making a scene and embarrassing her in front of everyone.\" I don't feel bad. My husband does. AITA?\n\nETA: She has 4 kids. My husband is the youngest (he's 27). Her two daughters have 1 child each, both 12yo girls. Her other son has 5 kids. She takes her daughters kids once a month. She has never made a conscious effort with any of her other sons kids, outside of his oldest (9f). She doesn't act like this with her other kids at all. She acts uninterested all together. Ages: (not sure if it's relevant) MIL is 61. My mom is 44. My husband and I are both 27.

Your mom called a spade a spade. If you would have done anything, she would have gaslit the hell out of you. However, having your mother, basically her peer, call her out in front of everything, holding back none of the niceties, either you or your husband would have had, put your MIL in her place.   \nJust look, she can't even call your mother out, because she knows she would not hold back and has no reason to continue to have a good relationship with her, however, you and your husband do. So, she blames the both of you, probably really you for not defending her craziness. \n\nIn her defense, a really small defense, it must have been hard having a son that looked nothing like her. So, in a way, this was a do over, where she could have a piece of her in your child. However, it really made no sense, because she tried to loop her son into it, where he looks nothing like her.

The first thing she said when she visited my son at the hospital was \"he's got our family's hair\" - although that kid was mostly bald at first. My daughter who is my spitting image of course looks EXACTLY like her. Then, everything my children did of course came from her side of the family. I mean, I am a professional musician and all my kids play instruments, but of course they only have this talent because her second grade cousin played the piano for a year in elementary school. I love building Lego with my kids and we've designed and built so many things together, but they only enjoy that because SHE bought my husband a small Lego set when he was nine. My children love cooking and baking with me but that has to be because her brother has a bakery. The list goes on (and on and on)\n\nWhenever my husband and I had plans to do something alone with the kids, she had a serious emergency. Once she fabricated a story that my husband's grandmother was dying and he had to come ASAP because the priest was already there and prayed for her and she'll be dying any minute. Spoiler alert, she only had a light cold, there was no priest and she went to live on three more years. But my husband was completely shaken at the prospect that his beloved grandmother could be dying and it took a long time for him to believe that his mother had done this on purpose.\n\nWe had to go very low contact for a long while and have only recently started to include her again.

That may add to her insecurities as she probably feels she \"lost\" her baby to his new family. And absolutely tickled that your mom spoke out too! That's not ok.

MIL sounds like she has multiple narcissistic traits.\n\nNarcs are big on neglect of their kids but target one to be their golden child. They also only see value in people they can use in some way, so that's who they focus their attention upon. When they no longer get whatever they want from somebody, they drop them quickly, like she did with you.\n\nNarcs are also big on triangulating family members against one another, control, denial, manipulation and delusions. They're easily threatened by someone else getting attention (your husband loving his baby). They also like to play a game called DARVO (deny, attack then reverse victim and offender). So before the party and then at the party, she tried to minimize you as your child's mother (over and over again). When it didn't work and she got called out on it, she suddenly became \"the victim.\" *Wrong*.\n\nAttacking you - subtly or otherwise - makes her the aggressor, not the victim. Then, she goes on to threaten you via text to preemptively get the jump on your emotions, control the situation to her favor and further pit herself as the victim.\n\nReally, she's a master class in narcissism.\n\nDon't let her manipulate you. You two did nothing wrong. She needed to be called out and held accountable for her actions. No one should defend what she did to you and your baby. Brava to your mom!\n\nYour husband acting like a deer in headlights seems to be a flight-fight-fawn-or-freeze response. She's likely traumatized him and manipulated him throughout his life (as well as his siblings), and he may not even be aware of it because narcs are so **insidious** and can be very covert. That's probably why he feels badly now: She has conditioned him to react that way to her whims (she wants him to be controllable).\n\nNarcs mess with your mind and it's rough/confusing/painful to deal with. Many children of narcs end up going low or no contact with the parent who's disordered, because they don't improve. They don't change. They worsen as they get older.

I was happy to see your husband is ready to correct her but hope he doesn't feel too bad, given how demeaning and unkind it is to insinuate you aren't an important part of the baby's existence despite being the one who did all the physical labor. And the trying to drag him out of the delivery room is loony asf but also a dark predictor to what she's willing to do to get whatever emotional needs she has met. If she wants to feel closer to her son or feels threatened by the baby, she won't consider any harm she causes by putting her own feelings first and insisting others join. I have yet to experience or hear a story about boundary-crossing behavior that gets better by ignoring it. \n\nSorry for the philosophical rant, and I hope you guys are having a peaceful and fulfilling bonding time with baby and building your lovely little family otherwise."]}
