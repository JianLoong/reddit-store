{"id": 15727, "submission_id": "12zhctd", "title": "AITA for telling my friend his issues aren't as important as his wife's?", "selftext": "So my friend, Tim (fake), (27M) and I (25M) frequently talk and work with each other to help each other grow and be better. We're not afraid to call each other out and criticize one another if we're being stupid, lazy, immature, etc. This leads to us telling each other everything to make sure we're doing our best.\n\nWell recently Tim has been talking to me about his adult intimacy issues with his wife. The issue being that there is none. This is a huge issue for him, these types of activities and intimacy is something he needs in relationships to be happy, understandable. He's not an addict or anything, it's just very important to him.\n\n**Now to the issue:**\n\nFYI, any info about their relationship is from him. I have spoken to his wife about the funeral, her father, etc, but not about their issues, so this is one sided.\n\nA little more than 6 months ago, his wife's father died. Cancer, plus age (70s), plus a lifetime of smoking/drinking, it surprised no one, arguably worse than something sudden. And of course between arrangements, legal crap, and just general mourning, his wife wanted nothing to do with physical intimacy. He didn't either for a bit, we all get it.\n\nBut now things have been calm for months, obviously the wife is still upset but nothing more than you'd expect from a mourning daughter, she's not locked in the room and unmoving or even crying anymore. She's doing well but is still not intimate at all with him. There's hand holding and cuddling but anything further isn't okay with her. He's upset about this. He says he understands a few weeks/months of not feeling up for it but now it's been over 6 months and shows no signs of changing. He's getting frustrated and it's really eating him up. There's a lot more detail but you get the picture.\n\nI told him he needs to suck it the fuck up. My words were as follows, edited for reading:\n\n\"She's just been through the most traumatic thing ever in her life. Shes lost her father and the man she looked up to and loved far before you ever came along. He was her first rock, her first teacher, her first sense of safety and love. It's not surprising she doesn't want to fuck you after losing a person she's known for almost 30 years. It's been 6 months, get over it. You'll be fine not getting your dick wet for a bit.\n\nI know this type of intimacy is important to you, but think of how important your actions during her time of grief are to her. She needs a rock, someone she can lean on and cry into when she needs to without feeling the need to suck his dick or spread her legs to make sure *his* needs are met during this time.\"\n\nFrom there he got upset and we had a back and forth about how I'm not understanding and aren't thinking about his needs as a person like I am with her. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My friend is upset his wife doesn't want to have sex 6 months after her father died. I told him to get over it.

A good friend, contrary to what a lot of folks think, is someone that will shoot it to you straight, not just tell you what you want to hear.

I don't think that you were trying to hurt your friend, but help him see the wifes perspective.  \n\nINFO - Has he tried to talk about his feelings of neglect with the wife?

Keep being a good friend to this couple.  It sounds like you are trying to keep him understanding, but I can also see his side of things.  This is hard for him as well.

From my experience, behind closed doors, he is probably annoying as fuck to her about having sex all the time. Which, unfortunately is a positive feedback loop of her being the most turned off she can possibly be.

The husband's frustration is also valid. 6 months is a long time but to be fair, all he has done was secretly confide his frustrations to his bestfriend and has still been a good, present husband to his wife. I found your words a little strong but I don't disagree with it either. I'd say NAH, or soft YTA but only for your last sentence.", "NAH. I think that she needs therapy. When you have a partner who does want intimacy there does come a point where his needs will need to be considered again as well. Be it with watching porn, maybe permission to get a lapdance at a strip club or massage with happy ending or something if the wife isn't yet ready to provide.", "Soft YTA\n\nYour friend was venting about something that was bothering him. He felt judged and unsupported. He may not want to confide in you in the future.\n\nI believe your intentions were good, but his needs in the relationship need to be considered as well. It's been six months; his wife may be out of sorts for a while yet (and she should definitely get grief counseling), and it sounds like he's been supportive of her overall. \n\nHe is not owed sex, but he does get to decide what is important in a relationship to him, and clearly intimacy is one of those things. That is okay. He's not giving his wife an ultimatum, but is looking for a way forward as nothing has changed. \n\nMarriages need to be tended; when they aren't, they stagnate or dissolve. It isn't uncommon for marriages to end after traumatic events because people just don't have the capacity to deal with the relationship as well. The only way to avoid that is by working through issues as a couple, not by one partner stuffing their feelings about an issue. That only leads to resentment.\n\nYour advice was for your friend to stuff his feelings; if he does that, it will absolutely not help his marriage.", "ESH. Lack of physical intimacy is a dealbreaker for a lot of people and you're wrong for telling him to just 'get over it'. However, what his wife is going through is understandable and she requires therapy. If he truly loved her he would respect her decisions and lay off the intimacy until she's back to her old self", "YTA\n\nWhile I don't disagree with you that his wife is likely going through too much right now to even think about intimacy, I really think you are being too harsh on your friend. Your friend was vulnerable with you, and your advice was to just deal with it. Your friends feelings of frustration are equally as valid as his wife's grief. Like it or not, intimacy is a very important part of relationships. But rather than give him any real advice, like speaking with a therapist or talking to his wife, you just told him to suck it up because his issues don't matter.", "ESH, soft YTA.\n\nPhysical affection is one of my love languages, and it can honestly be extremely frustrating when you have a partner that has a different libido level. I\u2019m talking feelings of frustration, sadness, tiredness, and that\u2019s not even from a period as long as 6 months. To speak practically, having a dry spell makes me not want to eat food, get out of bed, focus at work, etc. It might sound silly but it\u2019s true- it makes you feel unwanted and not valued. I imagine if someone\u2019s love language was acts of service and their partner wasn\u2019t engaging in that, then they would feel similarly.\n\nYou\u2019re right in that your friend\u2019s frustrations don\u2019t supersede his wife\u2019s- she\u2019s going through a terrible experience (I\u2019ve lost my father to cancer too). And he isn\u2019t right in labeling himself as a victim. However, I do think that he has a valid point in being frustrated, and you have to understand that HOW you said your message didn\u2019t resonate with him. It just made him defensive and not feel acknowledged, and probably aggravated his frustration. Ultimately, that\u2019s not going to help him or his wife. I think you should have a softer conversation with him to apologize for how you voiced your message, while also suggesting therapy for him and his wife.", "ESH, you are right that he isn't entitled to sex. He is okay to be frustrated about the lack of intimacy on a relationship. Intimacy is important in a relationship especially when young.", "YTA. Physical intimacy is hugely important for some people. While you aren\u2019t wrong that she is going through a lot, your friend isn\u2019t wrong in the way he feels either. He\u2019s not pressuring her into anything, he\u2019s not treating her badly because of it. He\u2019s simply upset because a huge part of their relationship screeched to a halt and has not resumed.\n\nOne is not more important than the other. Also, the way you spoke about them is crude and vulgar, and the way you describe her relationship with her father in this context is odd. Her relationship with her father has nothing to do with her physical relationship with her spouse.", "YTA - your friend was being vulnerable and sharing his feelings with you and your response was to jump down his throat. \n\nHe is allowed to miss intimacy with his wife, if that is an important thing to him, why is he not allowed to be frustrated by the loss of it?\n\nYou need to get over yourself, I don\u2019t know who you are trying to impress with your white-knighting, you owe your friend an apology.", "Yes, unfortunately YTA for suggesting his needs are less important than hers. They are equally important. He has been there for her for half a year, but intimacy is extremely important and it seems like his partner has closed herself off completely. That, as a partner who needs intimacy to feel loved, will absolutely destroy him. You could have taken this from the angle that he is doing great so far and he just needs to bear with it until she is ready, and then commiserate on just how colossal of a burden has been on his shoulders for such a long time, and how it awful it is to be married to someone who is not able to give back to you. You could have tried to show even the tiniest bit of empathy, but instead you chose to try and crush him.", "YTA, and I think your friend is correct that you've entirely missed the point of his venting. \n\nSeems like he realizes his issues aren't the priority and tried to vent to a close friend who went nuclear on him. Now he knows not to vent to you", "I would day ESH or no one is TA here; I do think his concerns are valid but at the same time so is his wife's grief and need to refrain from sexual intimacy. I agree that he should be able to tighten the ship and let her heal at her own pace. I also think that some other pieces are needed here, such as therapy and counseling to help her process. Good on you though for keeping him grounded and helping him understand his need for sex should not trump a grieving daughter.", "NTA because you said what he needed to hear. Unfortunately, it sounds like he was venting to you about this situation because he wants to cheat (or has already) and wants confirmation from someone else that he should, but your response to him was the opposite of what he wanted to hear.", "YTA. This is bad advice. Six months is way too long for something like this and she needs to talk to someone.", "If you delivered it like that sorry but you are a massive AH", "NTA, he sounds like addicted to the bedroom stuff.", "NAH but I suspect friend is getting nervous  with the dead bedroom and will start cheating soon. \n\nHe also won't tell you to avoid judgement.", "I'd bet my bottom dollar neither you nor the husband knows what's actually going on with this woman.

It's arrogant for you to just assume you know how she's processing it or what she is feeling.\n\nYTA for speaking for the wife when you have no idea what's in her head.

Your words came from a place of trying to help. \n\nThat said, it doesn't seem like your friend's wants are unreasonable. While he's being respectful of his wife, he's allowed to feel neglected - physically, emotionally, etc - after 6 months. \n\nHe and his wife need to work on communication.

He is your friend whatever your opinion is you are supposed to let him vent to you so he doesn't explode one day to his wife", "> So she needs more time to mourn and get back into her own headspace that makes her want to be intimate than if it were just an acquaintance.\n\nNo. She can grieve all she wants, but not having sex with her husband has nothing to do with the massive role her father played in her life. You don\u2019t just decide oh, I was really close with my father, and therefore I can\u2019t have sex with my husband.\n\nPeople grieve differently, and that\u2019s totally fine, but if her long-term grief is having a detrimental effect on other areas of her life, she may not be handling it in a healthy way. I don\u2019t know these people personally, but I would say seeing a therapist might help.\n\nHe isn\u2019t entitled to sex, but physical intimacy is a huge part of most romantic relationships. Her grief doesn\u2019t negate what he is feeling, nor is it more important. You can think he should be more understanding, but you telling him that her needs are more important than his is just flat out wrong.\n\nAn actual good friend would have advised them to communicate, with professional help if needed, rather than to just tell him to shake it off because she\u2019s more entitled to her feelings. That\u2019s nonsense.", "This is going to sound harsh, but the lack of intimacy is his wife\u2019s fault, he is clearly willing, she isn\u2019t. If he was forcing her to have sex, that would be a different issue, but he is just expressing how difficult it has been with it missing.\n\nI think you are the one interpreting his frustrations and venting as him claiming to be a victim.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to qualify people\u2019s trauma, you\u2019re not the one experiencing either of these situations. The loss of intimacy may seem like less of a big deal to you, than the death of a parent, but again, you\u2019re not your friend you don\u2019t get to tell him how to act, you don\u2019t know how being intimate with his wife makes him feel. \n\nYou are looking at sex just your friend wanting to \u201cget his dick wet\u201d, have you considered the fact that it could be more than just a physical pleasure for him, maybe that is when he thinks they have their best emotional connection as well, that could be what brings them closest together as a couple. Now that has been missing for months.\n\nPerhaps you need to get over your preconceived notion that men just want sex simply for pleasure.", "OP doesn\u2019t deserve any thanks, who said the wife needs someone to stand up for her, isn\u2019t that rather misogynistic thinking?\n\nWe don\u2019t know that the husband hasn\u2019t spoken to his wife about this, what if he has and the wife has been unresponsive or brushes him off; is he wrong for wanting to be intimate with his wife again. The father died 6 months ago, yes it sucks, but it\u2019s a part of life, but at some point you have to get back to normal. \n\nIntimacy, in any form, is a big part of most relationships, if that is suddenly taken away, for whatever reason, it sucks. If the wife can\u2019t/won\u2019t get intimate again, then she needs to communicate what it will take for that to happen.", "Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm going to stop following the sub soon, I don't know how or when it happened but it seems like every post has absolutely wild responses now. 90% of the comments come off like someone trying to fulfill some kind of justice boner either against the OP or the other party involved in the post", "If he's so desperate, he can do stuff on his own, and let his poor wife to grieve.", "Never underestimate a guy used to regular sex suddenly going dry. For no other reason guys recently separated immediately seek women to have a relationship (regular sex) with them, even if they love their ex wholeheartedly. \n\nAnd will also demonstrate his frustration in the small things. Time for couple's therapy.", "Just thought it was worth asking. I personally don't think we'd put as much onus on the wife for \"stepping up and being an actual partner\" and would instead put the onus on the husband to get over it. There'd probably be a few mentions of being a mama's boy.\n\nThis sub has a tendency to side with the wives in marriage posts (except for most wedding stuff, where we love to claim bridezilla). Something to consider.", "We are both very clear when we want to just vent. We explicitly state it so that when issues like this arise we can be sure the other is looking for advice/help", "That's not at all who we are. If we want to vent we make that clear. Otherwise, we're looking for advice and help, even if that advice is \"get over it\" or \"toughen up\". It isn't always, but sometimes it is.\n\nAnd feelings can definitely be wrong. I'm not saying he's wrong for being frustrated here, but he's putting himself first when imo, which he can disagree with, he should be putting his wife first, no questions asked for this specific instance.", "Do you hear (read) yourself? So you\u2019re saying \u201ccry all you want, woman; just spread your legs for me while you\u2019re at it\u201d.", "Its completely normal that grief kills your libido so yes its very much linked\n\nThe more important the person in your life (like an awesome father) the deeper the grief\n\nPhysical intimacy can be many things not just sticking your dick in", "You\u2019re making an incredible amount of ASSumptions", "> best emotional connection \n\nHave you ever considered that maybe, just maybe, a person in grief is not in the best disposition to have \u201cemotional connections\u201d or at least not the same as it used to be? Also, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s completely emotionally neglected; the post and narration from the husband is that they do other things like cuddle and hug, for intimacy just that the sex is a little too much for the wife AT THE MOMENT. So yeah, it is just about \u201cgetting his dick wet\u201d. \n\nHeaven forbid your parent dies, and your husband is at your tail being \u201cjust get over it already; just spread your legs, woman\u201d instead of being your rock and confidant.", "Okay and why does that mean he can't be frustrated? Or that he addicted?", "Just to be clear:\n\n\"get over it\" and \"~~man~~ toughen up\" are generally both 99% horrible advice for anything.", "Not at all what I\u2019m saying. Try again.", "So is OP.", "Literally just a rough translation of your first paragraph. \u201cShe can grieve but the man has to have his \u2018needs\u2019 met\u201d. Maybe put down the red pills for a sec and understand that the wife is an actual HUMAN BEING with a limited capacity (likely drained by this tragic event) and not a mere vessel for the husband\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d."]}
