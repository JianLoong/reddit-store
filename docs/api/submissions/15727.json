{"id": 15727, "submission_id": "12zhctd", "title": "AITA for telling my friend his issues aren't as important as his wife's?", "selftext": "So my friend, Tim (fake), (27M) and I (25M) frequently talk and work with each other to help each other grow and be better. We're not afraid to call each other out and criticize one another if we're being stupid, lazy, immature, etc. This leads to us telling each other everything to make sure we're doing our best.\n\nWell recently Tim has been talking to me about his adult intimacy issues with his wife. The issue being that there is none. This is a huge issue for him, these types of activities and intimacy is something he needs in relationships to be happy, understandable. He's not an addict or anything, it's just very important to him.\n\n**Now to the issue:**\n\nFYI, any info about their relationship is from him. I have spoken to his wife about the funeral, her father, etc, but not about their issues, so this is one sided.\n\nA little more than 6 months ago, his wife's father died. Cancer, plus age (70s), plus a lifetime of smoking/drinking, it surprised no one, arguably worse than something sudden. And of course between arrangements, legal crap, and just general mourning, his wife wanted nothing to do with physical intimacy. He didn't either for a bit, we all get it.\n\nBut now things have been calm for months, obviously the wife is still upset but nothing more than you'd expect from a mourning daughter, she's not locked in the room and unmoving or even crying anymore. She's doing well but is still not intimate at all with him. There's hand holding and cuddling but anything further isn't okay with her. He's upset about this. He says he understands a few weeks/months of not feeling up for it but now it's been over 6 months and shows no signs of changing. He's getting frustrated and it's really eating him up. There's a lot more detail but you get the picture.\n\nI told him he needs to suck it the fuck up. My words were as follows, edited for reading:\n\n\"She's just been through the most traumatic thing ever in her life. Shes lost her father and the man she looked up to and loved far before you ever came along. He was her first rock, her first teacher, her first sense of safety and love. It's not surprising she doesn't want to fuck you after losing a person she's known for almost 30 years. It's been 6 months, get over it. You'll be fine not getting your dick wet for a bit.\n\nI know this type of intimacy is important to you, but think of how important your actions during her time of grief are to her. She needs a rock, someone she can lean on and cry into when she needs to without feeling the need to suck his dick or spread her legs to make sure *his* needs are met during this time.\"\n\nFrom there he got upset and we had a back and forth about how I'm not understanding and aren't thinking about his needs as a person like I am with her. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My friend is upset his wife doesn't want to have sex 6 months after her father died. I told him to get over it. He thinks I'm an asshole.", "created_utc": 1682515208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zhctd/aita_for_telling_my_friend_his_issues_arent_as/", "score": 2085, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep being a good friend to this couple.  It sounds like you are trying to keep him understanding, but I can also see his side of things.  This is hard for him as well.

The husband's frustration is also valid. 6 months is a long time but to be fair, all he has done was secretly confide his frustrations to his bestfriend and has still been a good, present husband to his wife. I found your words a little strong but I don't disagree with it either. I'd say NAH, or soft YTA but only for your last sentence.", "NAH. I think that she needs therapy.

He felt judged and unsupported. He may not want to confide in you in the future.\n\nI believe your intentions were good, but his needs in the relationship need to be considered as well. It's been six months; his wife may be out of sorts for a while yet (and she should definitely get grief counseling), and it sounds like he's been supportive of her overall. \n\nHe is not owed sex, but he does get to decide what is important in a relationship to him, and clearly intimacy is one of those things. That is okay. He's not giving his wife an ultimatum, but is looking for a way forward as nothing has changed. \n\nMarriages need to be tended; when they aren't, they stagnate or dissolve. It isn't uncommon for marriages to end after traumatic events because people just don't have the capacity to deal with the relationship as well. The only way to avoid that is by working through issues as a couple, not by one partner stuffing their feelings about an issue. That only leads to resentment.\n\nYour advice was for your friend to stuff his feelings; if he does that, it will absolutely not help his marriage.", "ESH. Lack of physical intimacy is a dealbreaker for a lot of people and you're wrong for telling him to just 'get over it'. However, what his wife is going through is understandable and she requires therapy. If he truly loved her he would respect her decisions and lay off the intimacy until she's back to her old self", "YTA\n\nWhile I don't disagree with you that his wife is likely going through too much right now to even think about intimacy, I really think you are being too harsh on your friend. Your friend was vulnerable with you, and your advice was to just deal with it. Your friends feelings of frustration are equally as valid as his wife's grief. Like it or not, intimacy is a very important part of relationships. But rather than give him any real advice, like speaking with a therapist or talking to his wife, you just told him to suck it up because his issues don't matter.", "ESH, soft YTA.\n\nPhysical affection is one of my love languages, and it can honestly be extremely frustrating when you have a partner that has a different libido level. I\u2019m talking feelings of frustration, sadness, tiredness, and that\u2019s not even from a period as long as 6 months. To speak practically, having a dry spell makes me not want to eat food, get out of bed, focus at work, etc. It might sound silly but it\u2019s true- it makes you feel unwanted and not valued. I imagine if someone\u2019s love language was acts of service and their partner wasn\u2019t engaging in that, then they would feel similarly.\n\nYou\u2019re right in that your friend\u2019s frustrations don\u2019t supersede his wife\u2019s- she\u2019s going through a terrible experience (I\u2019ve lost my father to cancer too). And he isn\u2019t right in labeling himself as a victim. However, I do think that he has a valid point in being frustrated, and you have to understand that HOW you said your message didn\u2019t resonate with him. It just made him defensive and not feel acknowledged, and probably aggravated his frustration. Ultimately, that\u2019s not going to help him or his wife. I think you should have a softer conversation with him to apologize for how you voiced your message, while also suggesting therapy for him and his wife.", "ESH, you are right that he isn't entitled to sex. He is okay to be frustrated about the lack of intimacy on a relationship. Intimacy is important in a relationship especially when young.", "YTA. Physical intimacy is hugely important for some people. While you aren\u2019t wrong that she is going through a lot, your friend isn\u2019t wrong in the way he feels either. He\u2019s not pressuring her into anything, he\u2019s not treating her badly because of it. He\u2019s simply upset because a huge part of their relationship screeched to a halt and has not resumed.\n\nOne is not more important than the other. Also, the way you spoke about them is crude and vulgar, and the way you describe her relationship with her father in this context is odd. Her relationship with her father has nothing to do with her physical relationship with her spouse.", "YTA - your friend was being vulnerable and sharing his feelings with you and your response was to jump down his throat. \n\nHe is allowed to miss intimacy with his wife, if that is an important thing to him, why is he not allowed to be frustrated by the loss of it?\n\nYou need to get over yourself, I don\u2019t know who you are trying to impress with your white-knighting, you owe your friend an apology.", "Yes, unfortunately YTA for suggesting his needs are less important than hers. They are equally important. He has been there for her for half a year, but intimacy is extremely important and it seems like his partner has closed herself off completely. That, as a partner who needs intimacy to feel loved, will absolutely destroy him. You could have taken this from the angle that he is doing great so far and he just needs to bear with it until she is ready, and then commiserate on just how colossal of a burden has been on his shoulders for such a long time, and how it awful it is to be married to someone who is not able to give back to you. You could have tried to show even the tiniest bit of empathy, but instead you chose to try and crush him.", "YTA, and I think your friend is correct that you've entirely missed the point of his venting. \n\nSeems like he realizes his issues aren't the priority and tried to vent to a close friend who went nuclear on him. Now he knows not to vent to you", "I would day ESH or no one is TA here; I do think his concerns are valid but at the same time so is his wife's grief and need to refrain from sexual intimacy. I agree that he should be able to tighten the ship and let her heal at her own pace. I also think that some other pieces are needed here, such as therapy and counseling to help her process. Good on you though for keeping him grounded and helping him understand his need for sex should not trump a grieving daughter.\n\nedit: I wanted to say I commend your friendship and ability to be open and honest w each other- thus I don't think he's quite an AH. it's cool that he listens to you and was willing to face criticism. I didn't know how to word it earlier but that is mostly why I chose not to condemn him (and you for obvious reasons).", "NTA because you said what he needed to hear.

You've always given it to him straight, and right now he's only saying you're not \"considering his side\" because he doesn't like what you have to say.   \n\n\nTherapy is always beneficial when grieving, but all these people telling her to go to therapy and acting like it's been eons are shocking to me. It's only been SIX MONTHS- she hasn't even had so many firsts without her father- ie birthdays, holidays, etc. She's trying to adjust to her new life; grief is a process, and a very long one at that.   \n\n\nMaybe your friend should go to therapy if he feels like he can't satisfy his own needs with his right and left hand while his wife is in mourning.

Man calling his friend out said he does everything. Jesus christ get your head out of your ass.", "Sorry no this is not the bare minimum m. He literally said the guy does everything everyday to keep the house going and his wife\u2019s only contribution to the house is her job of which he also has. This is not healthy or normal. Housework should be divided between SO especially if they are both working. Now it is important to do the other stuff such as \u201ccourting\u201d as well but he is definitely doing much more than the bare minimum here.", "I think you're misunderstanding, he doesn't expect sex from her for doing those things, he does those things to make her happy so she can focus on whatever she wants. If that happens to be sex, cool, if it's knitting, or reading, or watching TV, also cool!\n\nAnd doing everything around the house while working is not bare minimum wtf? You think women shouldnt help at all in relationships?\n\nBut what does he do to court her? He buys her flowers, takes her everywhere she wants to go. Fuck, he booked a trip to Disney because she mentioned in passing she wanted to go. He takes her out to movies, dancing, or puts together a drive in for them when she wants to stay in. It's not like I know how often he texts her good morning or I love you, but I know he does. He loves this woman and wants her happy. This man actually went and got a license to be a masseuse and bought a fucking massage table because she likes the occasional massage. \n\nI can't tell you how he seduces her but I know he was successful at it before her father passed", "Excuse me, what? \n\n>what does he do to meet her needs??? cleaning up after himself is not meeting some ones needs, it's cleaning up a home you live in.\n\nMy interpretation of this is that he does a lot more than just the basics. Both of them work, but he does all grocery shopping, cooks every dinner, sweeps, mops, and cleans dishes, does molding sometimes. That can be considered general household duties, but he cooks dinner for her every night, that is at least one thing. Then he walks and feeds **her** dog, took time off to install a fence because **she** wanted it, got central air, gutters, started gardens, planted grass. Lastly the line OP said\n\n> He does everything when it's needed and when it's asked of him. She does nothing outside of work and love him.\n\nI agree this isn't related to sex or being \"deserving of sex\" at all, but he certainty is not lacking in taking care of her in this regard?", "Keep moving that goalpost", "i\u2019m sorry for your loss then. but my point is that grief is different for everybody. like i just said, my friend lost her father & she was numb for two years. like would never go out, didn\u2019t have sex with her husband during that time. grief most definitely has the capability to shut down a sex drive for six months, especially if she hasn\u2019t handled it well. if she\u2019s letting it plague her mind and prevent her from living her life- which happens -then it could also be the grief. but honestly, now that i think about it, i\u2019d bet it\u2019s a mixture of both of our points. if he\u2019s angry that she isn\u2019t having sex because she\u2019s grieving, he\u2019s probably letting that frustration be known which would make her even less likely to try to get her sex drive back.", "My father would never have done this to my mother. I\u2019d venture to say the majority that were in a happy marriage before the fact wouldn\u2019t", "They usually go hand in hand", ">the other side love to bring it up\n\nWhat other side? And why would you just follow the same actions if you already know it's a tired conversation? \n\nI'm suddenly not believing you when you're just asking questions for the sake of information.... Or was it \"Just think it\u2019s an interesting theoretical\"?", "It\u2019s actually quite upsetting me to that you don\u2019t think men would get sympathy for this because I\u2019m a woman and I can 100% say I\u2019d be fighting that man\u2019s corner day and nigjt", "Not at all", " But those are two distinct situations. One is on knowledge and not stepping up in a work environment. The other is how he feels about not having intimacy with his wife because she\u2019s grieving. \n\nI\u2019m all for the honesty thing and I do the same with people I care about and trust. But somewhere that one size fits all model can\u2019t work all the time. Life isn\u2019t black and white, it\u2019s so many shades of grey. \n\nAlso, you could have been nicer while telling him the same thing.  Like, \u201cI know that you are missing this part of your life. But have you thought about how your wife isn\u2019t quite there yet. You can communicate your feelings to her, but she might not be in the right headspace to hear it. She\u2019s still grieving her dad and you wouldn\u2019t want to be insensitive in how you tell her about it\u201d. Said exactly the same thing, but didn\u2019t call him an AH for how he\u2019s feeling.", "I would suggest not making stuff up. I understand your point but that was a very insensitive way to phrase your friend's desire for physical intimacy with his wife. Going to sleep, touching each other, cuddling, that can lead to physical intimacy. Painting a picture of wanting her to doll herself up after her dad died, is unfair to your friend when he's been a good friend and husband according to you.", "So you're putting words in his mouth. How nice of you. How *supportive.*\n\nAre you married? Have you ever had a steady sexual relationship? I'm starting to wonder. Because you seem to have a problem with someone wanting sex.\n\nAnd I'm going to linger on that word - \"wanting\" - for just a minute. Because you haven't told us that he's **done** anything. You haven't said that he has pressured his wife or spoken to her in an insensitive manner or anything else that would justify the way you went after him. You have taken it upon yourself to shit on your friend because of a *want* he has and a *feeling* he expressed. \n\nA feeling he expressed to you, by the way, who was supposed to be someone he could trust. Nothing I've read of his behaviour is abnormal or wrong. That's what you want someone to do in a case like this: express their feelings to a neutral third party because we know that bottling feelings up is unhealthy but talking to his wife in this case would be wrong.\n\nSeems to me that the only thing your friend did wrong here was trusting you.", "Op said 2 things -\n\n1) the wife's grief is understandable and more important. I agree with that. Everyone agrees with that. Hell, even the husband agrees with that according to OP.\n\n2) The husband needs to suck it up and shut up - I don't agree with that. 6 months of no sex is frustrating. And it's valid to feel and voice that frustration to a friend. I think It's even legitimate to share it with the wife, as long as he's not pressuring her into anything she's not ready to, but I'm willing to concede the point here and say don't say anything to her. \n\nBut not feeling frustrated? Not venting to a friend? Why not? What's the grave sin you think is being committed here?", "But just because you don\u2019t agree with his friends feelings or what the guy said, they are still some feelings that the husband has. They are still valid and should be better expressed to his wife.\n\nIf the husbands wife would be paralyzed, they would need to be able to communicate their feelings and work on them together. Her grief is important, his feelings of the lack of intimacy are important too. She needs to tell him how this affects her when he tells her. He may not be in the right or in the wrong, but his feelings are valid. \n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s the same vicious circle we have taught men for so long. Don\u2019t share your feelings unless it\u2019s anger or agression, don\u2019t cry, be a man or man up (which is so gross).", "1) Don't be a condescending ass.\n\n2) You're done in this thread. You're too invested and borderline spamming. I'm giving you the option to disengage, but if you post again in this thread it will be a ban.", "Do you think the part of one's brain that desires intimacy is like a switch you can just flick on and off? That's not how it works. I'm not saying he should be pressuring his wife for sex, absolutely not, but his feelings are valid too.", "Yes, actually. I have an MA degree in psychology. Where did you get your degree? Because I\u2019ve seen you weaponize therapy and tell people in this thread who say sex is important to them that they need to get help. Which is really gross and reinforces some really problematic stigmas about mental health, by the way. \n\nThere is no timeline for grief. There is a timeline and list of prerequisites that look at how much grief is effecting day-to-day life and at what point that grief becomes major depression and needs to be addressed in therapy. \n\nAgain, if you are no longer interested in things you used to like for a period of 6 months, and it\u2019s impacting your interpersonal relationships, then I would argue - and I think most of my professional peers would agree with me - that it\u2019s time to talk to someone.", "Okay so for starters, we don\u2019t really know how persistent he\u2019s been. We know he privately vented to OP, and that\u2019s it. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s constantly pushing her, or if he is waiting for her to initiate and she just hasn\u2019t, or if he has gently broached the topic once a month since month three or whatever. There\u2019s a big spectrum there. \n\nAnd he did understand for the first several months. Now at half a year, he\u2019s starting to have concerns. That\u2019s valid.", "I cant even pretend to be surprised", ">He is getting everything except sex\n\nAs I specifically stated for some people sex is the only way they can feel loved. If that is literally the only thing that will show she loves him he has nothing. Why are you assuming there is anything else?", "Clearly you don't understand how important sex is for many men to feel wanted and appreciated in relationship if you straight up dismiss every point he makes.\n\nIf you keep pretending like his feelings aren't important as well he will build up resentment and eventually lose his feelings. Intimacy is extremely important in a healthy relationship for most people.", ">help her recover and be there for her and help her through therapy \n\nIt's been 6 months, that step needs to already be completed, time is up for it and it's now impacting the relationship. It's not ok her mental health is still in the gutter.", ">There are sooooooooo many ways to express physical intimacy without penetration\n\nNot for everyone. You know many people only classify sexual acts as intimacy right? Most people expect their partners to desire them on a carnal level and show them that desire to feel loved in an intimate manner.", "You were the one that commented on my comment. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t care LOL bye", "Yup, read that comment again. You also can\u2019t write for shit \ud83d\ude02", "Listen buddy. A person has different ways to feel valued and bonded in a relationship. Currently his friend doesn\u2019t feel that in one of the ways he feels is important. It doesn\u2019t take higher priority over his wife\u2019s grieving. But if left unchecked, it will affect him and their relationship. Get your head out your ass and recognize that", ">Bitching is not \u201creasonable\u201d\n\nUh, yes it is. Are people really not allowed to vent their frustration especially to friends. What are we suppose to keep it all inside until we lose our shit completely?\n\n>it just shows the husband and you are more concerned about how the grieving person is showing up for the husband and how she\u2019s not recovering fast\n\nNo, it is reasonable to grieve for 6 months. It is also normal to get frustrated that part of your life has been put on hold for 6 months. \n\nIt is also isn't good to have a huge part of your life to be off balance for this long and it is time to start looking into that.\n\nWhether you like it or not sex is part of relationship. When part of a relationship is removed it will cause issues in the relationship.", ">He says he understands a few weeks/months of not feeling up for it but now it's been over 6 months and shows no signs of changing. He's getting frustrated and it's really eating him up.\n\nThat's all that we have. He understood a certain amount of time and now he's feeling frustrated. That's it. OP didn't tell us that this guy is talking to his wife, but he also didn't say that he isn't or what words he might be using. \n\nThere's nothing to support the motives and behaviours you're trying to attribute to him, either. It's just as likely either of us, or neither of us, has the right of it.\n\nBut ...\n\nHusband is entitled to feel however he feels. There is nothing wrong with experiencing an emotion. Speaking of that emotion to someone not likely to be hurt by its presence is a mature and responsible thing to do. And frustration at the situation can coexist with empathy for his grieving partner.", "For many husbands \u201cwill she let me do it to her\u201d = intimacy. And the fact that he doesn\u2019t seem emotionally intelligent leads me to believe he\u2019s the same way.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t be responsible for how another person feels. I\u2019m sure she wants to WANT sex too.   I used to pray I\u2019d be attracted to my ex so I wouldn\u2019t hurt him.  And then ended up having sex I didn\u2019t want or enjoy.  Cool eh? So fun to be railed on when you really just want to get laundry finished or call your mom.  Just because a wife isn\u2019t actively crying all the time doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not miserable. We aren\u2019t traffic lights that are just red or green.\n\nYou can\u2019t logic or therapy your way into making a partner want to be intimate with you if they\u2019re not attracted to you anymore for whatever reason - maybe his response to her crises was to be useless and oblivious- and doesn\u2019t want to have sex. Full stop.   \n\n\nThis is a case of : no doesn\u2019t mean \u201cconvince me\u201d\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want him.  If she did he wouldn\u2019t be bellyaching at work.

It\u2019s the same tired convo with people failing to run the \u201cif the roles were reversed\u201d argument.

It's a PARENT. That would take me at least a year to get over cuz I'm super close to them.\n\nYou, nor her husband can dictate when she's mentally healthy enough\n\nAnd he can't encourage loving sex by badgering her and ignoring the *reason* she's not intimate \n\nShe needs therapy and help\n\nIf he can't suck up six months of sex then he should ask her to suck up losing her father", "If he's mad he's been told to suck up his issues and he wants to tell his wife to suck up the loss of her father for his needs then he's a hypocrite \n\nIf he gets sex from her, it'll be from boundaries being broken down and being badgered and annoyed to the point of giving in versus truly feeling loving and caring again.\n\nAnd if the husband would prefer a \"shut the fuck up dude\" fuck versus an \"I love ylu\" fuck then he can keep on doing what he's doing", "Hehe bye bye", "I think I did you a favour!", "You seem kind of pressed", "Where is your empathy for his wife?", "I'll trust OP's assessment over your projection.\n\nAnd for the record, I've been in the wife's position.", "AMEN", "Well that\u2019s what he stated and as I don\u2019t know either of them and if I believe this random internet story I figure I should also believe the details.

His needs are just in direct conflict to hers (seemingly) and such, I think he needs to forget about his own needs for a bit until she is stable. He's not expecting a blowjob for dealing with the funeral arrangements or meeting with lawyers, but he does need sexual intimacy regardless.\n\nIf this was 9 months or 12 months, I'd be singing a different tune.

Nobody is owed sex, but it is a major expected component of a relationship and is a requirement for it to remain intact.\n\nMen dont want to have sex with an unwilling partner, they want and need her to be a willing partner.
