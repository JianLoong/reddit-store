My son wasn\u2019t happy but moved on, so she gets invited to family events and has for years.  My son now 27 is married to Bethany and she is a nice person. We never clicked, we don\u2019t have much in common and they live 2 hours away so it\u2019s hard to plan stuff to get to know her more. Really I\u2019m sure it will grow in time.\n\nNow we had a picnic and all the family members were invited. So Sabrina was there as normal and I thought the night was nice. Bethany come up to me at the end of the night and expressed that she is uncomfortable with her husband ex being everywhere and if I couldn\u2019t invite her for family stuff. I told her no and that Sabrina is part of the family and has been part of the family longer than she has. If their is an actually valid reason like her rude then I would consider it but she has done nothing.

You have chosen this girl over your son. Not just his new wife; your son. He was uncomfortable after the breakup, and you ignored him. You don't even talk about your son positively, but you rave about his ex. Thats pretty awful parenting. You're not even trying to befriend his wife, and your son is right to be furious with you about all of this.\n\nGood luck having a relationship with your grandchildren, because I really doubt you're going to have anything to do with them, and it's entirely your fault.", "My family is in a similar situation. But in our case, I\u2019m Bethany. I have never, and will never, ask my mil to stop seeing our version of Sabrina. I understand that they have a bond and it means a lot to them to see each other on holidays. BUT we deliberately don\u2019t see mil very often anymore. Every time we are around, at group events or just-us visits, my mil brings up how amazing his ex is. She tells anyone who will listen that she wishes her son and his ex had worked things out because she doesn\u2019t like me as much. Bethany will never forget your blatant favoritism. Your son will never forget it either. I\u2019m not saying that Sabrina needs to be uninvited to events. I\u2019m saying you need to put in more effort to make Bethany feel like her emotions matter to you at all.", "Lol be prepared to lose your son then and any future grandchildren that he might have. What a parent", "NAH you can invite whoever you want to events you host. With that being said, don\u2019t be surprised if you see less and less of your son and his wife since they\u2019re uncomfortable with you inviting his ex to everything.

You've spent the past 5+ years making sure that your son knows you value this relationship with his ex more than his comfort and now you're making his wife know it too.\n\nI'm glad she sees you as parental figures since you're going to destroy your actual relationship with your kid over this.", "OP, maybe have your husband invite some of his exes to family events also. You shouldn't mind. Right?\n\nEdit : Huge YTA", "you can still keep in contact with Sabrina without having your son and his wife be there take her out to lunches or go to her place of your place when your son isn't visiting.

You should be prioritizing the person that makes your kid happy aka Bethany. I understand if you see Sabrina as your kid, but you also have to understand that everyone is a grown adult at this point. And having your son\u2019s ex around at all family events isn\u2019t something he seems to happy about either. Maybe that should tell you something.

Your son didn't marry Sabrina, he married Bethany. You need to move on from the fantasy you created in your head.

You're lucky your son still has a relationship with you at all", "YTA.\n\nYour own son is mad about this so wouldn't that give you a clue that it's time to stop inviting Sabrina to every family function? She's not married to him. Bethany is. She has a right to ask and to be upset about it. I feel for the girl, honestly.", "Just to be clear you are 100% picking your sons ex over his now wife .. which means your putting the ex infront of your son ( becuase he and wife are a unit)", "Absolutely YTA. \n\nThis is a great way to make your son slowly start cutting you out of his life. You are disrespecting his marriage. Lovely that you think she is \"nice\", but I think you wouldn't *let* yourself \"click\" with Bethany because you're stuck on some pipedream about your son's ex being family.\n\nNo. **Bethany** is a part of your family.  Your son chose **Bethany**.  You should work on your relationship with her if you want your son to remain close to you.  How does the ex girlfriend feel about being around her ex boyfriend and his wife? \n\nThis is an unhealthy environment for everyone.", "YTA\n\nYou sound horribly insensitive toward Bethany and aren't really giving it a chance to bond and form a good relationship with her, because Sabrina is filling that spot for you.\n\nYour son and Bethany will no doubt keep more of a distance from you from now on, and when you wonder why, remember this moment and how uncomfortable your whole set up makes your son and his wife. But you'll have Sabrina as your daughter, so you won't miss your son that much.", "NAH- Your think of Sabrina as your own child. She is invited to things because you became her surrogate family. Bethany is not an AH for being upset that someone her husband once loved is invited to all your family events. I would also be upset if my husband\u2019s ex was accepted into his family while I am still struggling to feel like part of the family.", "YTA. You are the massive AH. You are picking the ex over your own son. I am sure that he will cut contact with you if you continue with that behavior of yours on who gets to be a part of the family or not.", "YTA - You are outwardly choosing your sons ex over the woman he married. You are showing not only your DIL but your SON who you value. You will loose your son over this so I would take time to think over who you want in your life more.", "Eventually you are going to have to choose between your son and the ex. What happens after they have kids and Bethany won't bring the grandbabies if Sabrina is there? You don't have to drop Sabrina completely but you do have to stop forcing her down Bethanys throat. YTA your relationship with Bethany will not \"grow in time\" if you continue to disrespect her.", "YTA \n\nIs this even a real post ? \n\nI can\u2019t believe you have so little awareness \n\nYour son is your real son - Sabrina is his ex \n\nYou will lose your real family \n\nSabrina is damn weird to be still creeping around her ex\u2019s family and it\u2019s not right that you chose her \n\nYou\u2019re going to be a very lonely mom and potential grandparent \n\nI hope Sabrina still hangs around when your son stops calling - betcha she doesn\u2019t", "Honestly this situation sucks. You think of ex as your daughter and leaving her out of family events will be such a shame. \n\nHowever, you also have to think about things from your DIL point of view. Imagine if your husband's ex was invited to all your family gatherings. It would hurt wouldn't it? Knowing that the person he loved is still considered family AND your MIL and FIL like her more than you.. \n\nIn the end it's YTA because your are prioritising ex over SON and DIL.

Her mom was \u201creally good friends\u201d with her ex and invited him to lots of stuff. Always had him bartend their big parties. It took mom going to a therapist who helped her see that the only real reason ex was putting so much time and effort into the friendship was to be around the daughter. They were both still hoping something would work out but my friend was having none of it. She found it really annoying and she wasn\u2019t even married to someone else. Not that the ex was a bad guy and didn\u2019t value the friendship with mom, but having him around all the time just wasn\u2019t healthy. I was really close to my ex MIL but when I divorced her son, we never spoke again.

You didn\u2019t even try to be sympathetic and she didn\u2019t even do anything wrong. You admitted to not knowing her well but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re even trying to get to know her. You\u2019re supposed to welcome her into your family and show her respect even if you\u2019re incapable of showing her love. I feel sorry for Bethany, it must be so lonely for her at these events where you put the ex on a pedestal. You don\u2019t come across as a kind and loving person.", "I\u2019m looking at the other side of a JNMIL thread right now.  Never really clicked, I wonder why when you\u2019re so hung up on his ex.

Keep it up and you\u2019ll lose a son and potential grand kids.", "YTA- A mega asshole at that.", "Ehhh, would have said N A H, but your last comments make YTA.\n\nYou are allowed to maintain a relationship with his ex. It's odd, but if you are that close.\n\nYour son and his fiance are also allowed to drop all further contact and not invite you to the wedding or their future lives.\n\nHonestly, I think you need to listen to your husband and son here. You cannot continue to force them to associate with the ex, and your ugly remarks towards his fiance shows that YOU haven't accepted its over.\n\nHe's not gonna marry her, he has his new bride.", "NTA. Family is more than just blood or marriage relation, or whom your kids are dating. It's the time invested in someone, the connection. You're allowed to have your own platonic connections, you're a human being, not just your son's mother. You're allowed to be a person outside of that and have friendships  with people even if your son doesn't want to continue one. You don't need his permission for whom *you* consider family, just like he doesn't need your permission for the same. He's 27, a full grown adult, it's time to develop his EQ and understand he's not the center of your life, and he has no say to whom you invite in your home and neither does his wife.", "Okay definitely gonna be an unpopular opinion but I would say NTA . I also disagree with all the people saying you're picking the ex over the wife/over your son. I've known other families who continue to have relationships with their kids ex's regardless of if the ex has a shitty home/family life or not. And this as been going on for years, before the son got with his wife, if he never voiced and problem with it before now it seems like his only issue is that it makes his wife insecure. Which makes me wonder what he's saying to make her feel that way. Does he talk about the ex a lot? Or compare how close she is to his mom but his wife is not?\n\nI can sympathize with the wife maybe feeling like it's hard to connect with you, if you and the ex are chatting a lot and hanging out with the ex during these events, so I could be helpful to reach out and plan some things for you two to do together so you can grow your relationship without her comparing it to how much easier/better you get along with the ex.", "Little bit YTA. Do you want to be right or do you want to have your son in your life? You\u2019re well on your way to forcing him to choose. If your son plans on having children and you continue not fostering a good relationship with his wife, good luck seeing her children.\n\nIf they live two hours away, you could simply not invite his ex-girlfriend to functions your son will be attending.", "Why would Sabrina want to be around when your son is tonguing Bethany down in front of the entire family ? Yeah Sabrina is psycho and you need to show Bethany more respect.", "Sabrina is not your family and Bethany is. You can choose Sabrina over her if you want but it will most likely cost you your relationship with your son and his WIFE. Only you can decide if it's worth it. No reason you can't see Sabrina separate from family functions.", "NAH. I mean, I can sort of see how it would be uncomfortable for Bethany, but it seems that at this point Sabrina is more of a family friend than your son's ex. As long as everybody keeps civil, there should be no problems, your son doesn't get to decide who YOU get to be friends with.", "I\u2019m going to go NTA\u2026 they were children when they dated and she needed a support system. So long as she isn\u2019t trying to be a threat and from this post I don\u2019t gather that she is. Bethany has some insecurities of her own to work out.", "NTA!
