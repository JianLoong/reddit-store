Really I\u2019m sure it will grow in time.\n\nNow we had a picnic and all the family members were invited. So Sabrina was there as normal and I thought the night was nice. Bethany come up to me at the end of the night and expressed that she is uncomfortable with her husband ex being everywhere and if I couldn\u2019t invite her for family stuff. I told her no and that Sabrina is part of the family and has been part of the family longer than she has. If their is an actually valid reason like her rude then I would consider it but she has done nothing.

You have chosen this girl over your son. Not just his new wife; your son. He was uncomfortable after the breakup, and you ignored him.

You're not even trying to befriend his wife, and your son is right to be furious with you about all of this.\n\nGood luck having a relationship with your grandchildren, because I really doubt you're going to have anything to do with them, and it's entirely your fault.", "My family is in a similar situation.

Every time we are around, at group events or just-us visits, my mil brings up how amazing his ex is. She tells anyone who will listen that she wishes her son and his ex had worked things out because she doesn\u2019t like me as much. Bethany will never forget your blatant favoritism.

It took mom going to a therapist who helped her see that the only real reason ex was putting so much time and effort into the friendship was to be around the daughter. They were both still hoping something would work out but my friend was having none of it. She found it really annoying and she wasn\u2019t even married to someone else.

Family is more than just blood or marriage relation, or whom your kids are dating. It's the time invested in someone, the connection. You're allowed to have your own platonic connections, you're a human being, not just your son's mother. You're allowed to be a person outside of that and have friendships  with people even if your son doesn't want to continue one. You don't need his permission for whom *you* consider family, just like he doesn't need your permission for the same. He's 27, a full grown adult, it's time to develop his EQ and understand he's not the center of your life, and he has no say to whom you invite in your home and neither does his wife.", "Okay definitely gonna be an unpopular opinion but I would say NTA . I also disagree with all the people saying you're picking the ex over the wife/over your son. I've known other families who continue to have relationships with their kids ex's regardless of if the ex has a shitty home/family life or not. And this as been going on for years, before the son got with his wife, if he never voiced and problem with it before now it seems like his only issue is that it makes his wife insecure. Which makes me wonder what he's saying to make her feel that way. Does he talk about the ex a lot? Or compare how close she is to his mom but his wife is not?\n\nI can sympathize with the wife maybe feeling like it's hard to connect with you, if you and the ex are chatting a lot and hanging out with the ex during these events, so I could be helpful to reach out and plan some things for you two to do together so you can grow your relationship without her comparing it to how much easier/better you get along with the ex.", "Little bit YTA.

If your son plans on having children and you continue not fostering a good relationship with his wife, good luck seeing her children.\n\nIf they live two hours away, you could simply not invite his ex-girlfriend to functions your son will be attending.", "Why would Sabrina want to be around when your son is tonguing Bethany down in front of the entire family ? Yeah Sabrina is psycho and you need to show Bethany more respect.", "Sabrina is not your family and Bethany is. You can choose Sabrina over her if you want but it will most likely cost you your relationship with your son and his WIFE. Only you can decide if it's worth it. No reason you can't see Sabrina separate from family functions.", "NAH. I mean, I can sort of see how it would be uncomfortable for Bethany, but it seems that at this point Sabrina is more of a family friend than your son's ex. As long as everybody keeps civil, there should be no problems, your son doesn't get to decide who YOU get to be friends with.", "I\u2019m going to go NTA\u2026 they were children when they dated and she needed a support system.

My MIL was the same way, and I hated her for it until the day she died 35 years later. Enjoy your life and no bitching when she goes NC with their kids.", "i think you may have misunderstood, here. seems very likely the option to have both your son and his wife and his ex attend was never there, and you just decided that you\u2019d rather have the ex attend family events than your son. guess you must really love her. i feel very sad for your son. i can\u2019t imagine how i would feel if my parents did that. yta.\n\nedit: not fiance! wife. sorry.", "NTA OP. Within certain contexts I can see this being a problem. With your situation and her family situation taken fully into account I think there is nothing wrong with your decision to continue to include her. She seems to have successfully moved on and so has your son.\nYou and your husband have unofficially adopted her a long time ago and I think it\u2019s time for the adult children to act like adults. Lots of people don\u2019t like certain members of their family. This doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to ask that certain family members should be excluded.", "I used to feel threatened by my ex\u2019s ex when I was a young adult. Im old now and understand relationships differently and am not threatened by these types of relationships anymore.", "If my MIL told me that my hb's ex had been around longer then me so I could suck it any relationship we might have had would be over.\n\nI'd love to hear Bethany's side of this, I'd bet you prioritize Sabrina in ways you don't share here.  Its probably why your actual DIl hasn't been more interested in a relationship with you.\n\nYou can have any relationship you want with anyone you want as long as you accept what that will cost you.  Sons are notorious for deferring to the wife, so if you're ok with not seeing much of you son and actual blood grandchildren then go ahead and keep prioritizing Sabrina.\n\nI hope this ends up being worth the cost.  Sometimes when relationships end we have to choose which ones to keep.   You might be able to chat with Sanrina discreetly on the side but continuing to ram her down your actually DIL's throat is going to cost you.\n\nAnd frankly, it's pretty trashy for Sabrina to ask your hb to walk her down the aisle and to continue to insert herself into your family.  I guarantee she knows Bethany is uncomfortable and she's just fine with that.  Doesn't speak very highly of her.", "NTA-maybe?\n\nIt is an odd dynamic.\n\nIs there any chance your relationship with Sabrina is interfering with a potential relationship with Bethany? \n\nObviously Bethany knows who you prefer, and of course that hurts her feelings.\n\nWill Bethany be less emotionally invested in fostering a relationship between you and her potential children? \n\nNot out of malice, just out of apathy? Visiting must be pretty burdensome for her, and I\u2019m sure there must be concern her potential children will also be kept at arms length. \n\nMaybe not an AH, but I wonder if you won\u2019t suffer the consequences anyway.", "Everyone has views on if you're the AH or not. People saying they need to suck it up and deal with the ex probably wouldn't like it if they were in Bethany or your sons shoes. There are very few people who would be okay with having their ex or their partners' ex around at every family event. That would be very awkward and they wouldn't want to come anymore. I understand that you care for Sabrina, but if I were Bethany or your son, I would cut you off. You said, \"This is asking me to choose between two children, I will not disown one.\" You are choosing between them no matter what you decide. Either way, someone is going to feel less important, understood, and cared for. You could try telling Sabrina you care for her and still want to be a part of her life, but she can't come to every family get-together. You could tell your son and Bethany to suck it up and completely alienate your son, his wife, and potential grandchildren. You might not like it, but don't be mistaken, YOU ARE CHOOSING.", "I want to say N A H but as someone who was a Sabrina, YTA and she kinda is too. I was very close to my ex\u2019s mom to the point where she called me her missing daughter and the daughter she never had. My ex and I broke up, so I distanced myself. There were days I missed that parental figure but I had to let go, she did not have a place in the next chapter of my life. It hurt, as someone who had lost my mom, I cried a lot. Even now I lost two additional mother figures and KNOW it\u2019ll hurt if I have to distance myself from my SOs family if we end things but I would because of the fact I respect them.

I will always pick my daughter-in-laws comfort over the ex. Your choices are making your son\u2019s life harder and it\u2019s not our job to create trouble for our kids. If you\u2019re looking for your son to go LC or NC, then you\u2019re going about it the right way. If your not planning on bonding with future grandkids, stay on the track you\u2019re on. Your son has put the ex behind him, and expressed to you that he isn\u2019t okay with you inviting her to family gatherings. You really need to respect his and your daughter-in-law\u2019s wishes.

And why are you even here when you don\u2019t even care if you\u2019re the asshole?", "YTA, I had a high school sweetheart and was very close with his family. Our relationship also just died because we got older and just grew apart romantically. HOWEVER as much as I am still in contact with his family and on good terms I stopped getting invited and being in the family. Your choice to maintain a relationship with his ex while actively lacking a relationship with his wife is only going to hurt you. He is married to her, she is your daughter by marriage and if they have children they WILL be your blood. Out of everyone your DIL is not the person you should choose not to pick first, because when you are going to lose a relationship with your son and future BLOOD grandchildren over this.\n\nYou say they are two hours away so they do not visit much? Me and my husband live 2.5 hours away from his parents and visit OFTEN.. why? Because his mother treats me like a daughter and I am always excited to visit.

You sound like a stubborn old bitch who is about to lose her ACTUAL child from her life.", "YTA but obviously have no interest in hearing that answer. Everyone here has already explained why.\n\nJust don\u2019t be surprised when you don\u2019t see your son much anymore, because this isn\u2019t about Bethany.

I hope you like whoever Sabrina marries because I guess they\u2019re your family now.", "YTA x100 and don\u2019t be surprised if your son and Bethany choose to no longer come to your family events since you\u2019ve made it clear you care more about his exes feelings than your own son.", "YTA.  What a great way to loose contact with your son and future grandchildren.", "YTA this is about your son your very own son. Frankly you sound like a very inconsiderate mother and MIL.

It is clear to your son that you have chosen someone he has awkward history with that will create difficulties with his current partner. \n\nNot only that, you made it clear that the woman he chose will never be accepted into the family the way his first ex was. I would expect them to continue to withdraw from you. So, you are causing the relationship with your son and his growing to deteriorate.", "YTA\n\nWould you be okay with your husband's ex being to every event because your mother/MIL thinks of them as their kid?", "YTA.

I\u2019m not sure if you just wanted a daughter and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. \n\nAlso, you give an excuse about living 2 hours away from Bethany so it\u2019s hard to get to know her more but we live in a world where it\u2019s easy to FaceTime/video chat or even just text someone.", "YTA If you love Sabrina so much, then grab lunch with her or something.

Sounds like you've basically adopted her at this point and she doesn't actually do anything to earn being suddenly dropped from her adoptive family's life. The fact your son called you an asshole for it is way over the line.", "I mean, at the highest level, this is a question of whether you actually want to build a relationship with your son's wife, and maintain a relationship with your son. You say that you guys don't click, and that they're far enough away that you don't have much time to visit them. Now that you know Bethany's uncomfortable with Sabrina being at all the family events, you know that you might be making it even harder to develop a relationship if she's not comfortable coming to family events. Your son might stop coming to family events as much.\n\nAnd then, on the more granular level, YTA for telling Bethany that Sabrina's been 'part of the family for longer than she has.' If she's feeling any sense of inferiority, you've just made your position abundantly clear, and made her insecurities worse, making all of this much harder than it needs to be. That was a really rude way to handle the situation.\n\nIs there room to compromise? Talk to your son and Bethany and explain that you don't want to make them uncomfortable and you're sorry for making it sound like a competition, but you do consider Sabrina family and don't want to cut her off completely. Talk about hosting some events with Sabrina, some without? Make the effort to visit them one-on-one to build a relationship with Bethany?", "Definitely NTA. Women come and go but you built a relationship with the young lady. It\u2019s probably a good idea she misses a few events but definitely not all of them", "Info: I\u2019m torn on this one. My family had a very similar situation where my aunt and uncle got divorced but my aunt was so close to all of us and my grandparents that even after they both remarried her and her new husband always came to all our holiday events. We would\u2019ve hated to lose her. Now if you\u2019re constantly harping on their old relationship and we\u2019re being vocal about their reunification id say for sure YTA, but you said yourself you don\u2019t want that. Sabrina doesn\u2019t have active positive parents in her life.  If that\u2019s the role you guys have taken on  I can imagine that would be devastating for her to lose. I would talk to your son. Is he upset with Sabrina being at the events because it makes him uncomfortable? Does he still feel some type of way about seeing her? Or is he upset primarily because SIL is insecure about it? I\u2019m not saying Bethany\u2019s feelings are invalid but they\u2019re married\u2026. Isn\u2019t this the type of baggage that comes up way before marriage? I have so many questions of why this is a problem now. If Sabrina is engaged I assumed her fianc\u00e9 has been at the parties too. Why haven\u2019t Sabrina and Bethany formed an understanding of intentions before the marriage took place?", "INFO: did your son ever express discomfort or offense with Sabrina continuing to join family events before getting with Bethany? or is this only a problem for Bethany?", "You don't seem to be able to comprise with your son. Why is that? You can put space between the son and Sabrina. You could see Sabrina every weekend, except the weekend your son comes. Unless Sabrina is significantly emotionally stunted, she will understand. We comprise in relationships that we value.", "Personally I'd say NAH however I'm sure it would help heal relationships if you planned some family functions without the ex. I'm sure if you talked to her she would understand and maybe in time everyone will get over it if your son and his wife have some family time without the ex so they can feel included and loved too.\n\nOtherwise I fear you will loose your son as he has expressed his discomfort and currently you have not really acknowledged it.", "Did Sabrina fianc\u00e9 come to the family picnic?", "Why can't you just see them at different times? Unless it's something big like a wedding or a funeral or maybe your birthday why would \"family events\" need to be the whole family?\n\nAnd why wouldn't you just say \"she's  is part of the family\" and leave out the part about being there longer than Beth?

Your child (son )is uncomfortable  with her being there she shouldn't  be there.", "She's not as much family as your actual son who you raised is and you are being wildly disrespectful to him and his chosen partner in life.", "No she is not, why do you care more about her feelings than your ACTUAL child?", "And you're others daughter is by Law.  You should have separated a bit from Sabrina when they broke up. You realize that you are hurting her,and perhaps the reason she doesn't want to come is she doesn't want to see this other woman.  If you insist on her being your daughter and being their every single time not considering your son's feelings. Did you think maybe him seeing her all this time was painful. You don't love your son, you think you do. But you don't", "You realize you\u2019re jeopardizing any future ACTUAL! Grandchildren you may have bc you can\u2019t be wrong? Get some freaking therapy", "You can think what you want. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are actively pushing away your ACTUAL son and DIL.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about S, you can very easily be in her life and not force your actual children into uncomfortable situations. I feel there will be a \u201cwhy won\u2019t my son and DIL talk to me anymore\u201d post in your future. YTA.", "Yes, I agree she was a parental figure. But OP is putting that relationship above the one with her son, who she (I\u2019m assuming) fully raised. Just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I\u2019ve got sympathy for the ex, but this whole situation feels wrong. Just my 2 cents.", "Thats not choosing the ex here. This is \"you are both welcome\".", "Because It's nothing more then smoke and mirrors so she can go back to friends and claim she tried so it can't be her actions that are the problem. She hasn't tried on an actual genuine level and her son and Bethany both know it. \n\nIf she tried Bethany wouldn't be uncomfortable with Sabrina being around because Bethany wouldn't feel like the in laws are still pining for their son to be with Sabrina.", "It's not about anything Sabrina has done, its about OP and her husband and how they treat Bethany compared to Sabrina. Calling one crazy, and openly comparing and choosing Sabrina over their son and dil is the problem.", "But there are other ways to maintain that relationship that doesn't include subjecting your son and his partner to that person at *every* family event, and telling your son's *actual* wife that she matters less because she got there later.", "What you learned today has been confirmed by most of my life experiences so far. Not saying my life experiences are abundant as I\u2019m 30 and hardly a wizened sage. IMO, most adults suck at communicating. They get a little better in their 20s than their teens, and the improvement mostly ends there. I\u2019m still learning everyday how I can improve. It happened once I took on a managerial role, got married and had a kid. \n\nNow I needed to communicate with subordinates, a spouse  and a toddler. I used to think I was good. And I was pretty good at communicating with peers and superiors , due to school. Now I know I have much to learn.", "What detail from any of the story makes it seem like communication is what any party excels at? You think your managers at work communicate properly? You think your parents? Do you even communicate properly? The main driver for communication is interests. The mom just wants to hear she\u2019s right.", "That's where I'm at. Bethany is really coming off as the problem? Sabrina isn't interested in son, Bethany can't not want a relationship with OP but then also say that OP isn't allowed to have relationships with people that make her uncomfortable for silly reasons.\n\nLike, there is no problem except for Bethany making one up. It's not that deep?", "If they want a good relationship with their son, they will. You know, their actual family.\n\nShe is not their daughter. OP massively overstepped from the very beginning of this relationship. Probably wished son had been born a daughter. Reeks of that.", "She\u2019s not an adopted daughter. She is a person their son dated for a short time, and the parents massively have overstepped ever since. \n\nShe\u2019s someone who they met based on the age of their son, when she was 17.\n\nI hope the son goes no contact, because that\u2019s what his parents deserve.", "Any normal person, would not be okay with their parents trying to incorporate some person they dated for a couple of years in their late teens, into the family.\n\nNotice Op has left out the length of the relationship. But you can tell based on the son\u2019s current age, and that they broke up in college, it wasn\u2019t very long. \n\nI bet this is just some girl the son dated for a year or two, and mom just can\u2019t let it go.\n\nOP is so gross.", "She tried to develop the same relationship with Bethany, who has decided to take no part in developing a relationship, or so she says.", "Wouldn\u2019t care if my exes were there.  His mom developed a relationship that couldn\u2019t just be thrown away.  World doesn\u2019t work that way.", "You\u2019re clearly not as wise and mature as you think if you couldn\u2019t even bring yourself to answer my question.", ">She is NOT your daughter\n\nWhy exactly is that your call and not OP's? Half the time reddit is all \"DNA doesn't matter\" and the rest of the time it's \"DNA should rule all your choices\".", "Sure, except by telling the new DIL that the ex is more important because she was in the family longer, this woman made her stance perfectly clear. She\u2019s going to end up alone with no contact with her son at the rate she\u2019s going.", "I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say here, even a little: \n\n>You think your managers at work communicate properly? You think your parents? Do you even communicate properly? The main driver for communication is interests. \n\nso I'm not sure you're in a position to throw stones.", "It's not throwing it away if she isn't at every single thing.  She should have divided her time between her pseudo and bio children.  \n\n\nYou wouldn't care? Really consider having them there for every event.  Do you think you'd br able to separate your past 100% of the time and not feel on guard.", "People don\u2019t have to answer your stupid fucking questions, or have anything to prove to you buddy", "It's almost like there are shades of grey to this shit.\n\nI wouldn't want my mom inviting over my ex to family functions.", "It's not anybody's \"call\", it's simply the fact. She did not give birth to her, she did not adopt her, she did not raise her as an infant/toddler/adolescent.", "She asked for an opinion. I didn\u2019t ask for yours. And don\u2019t care.", "Depends on how great each relationship is i think.   \n\nI really wouldn\u2019t care.    Any and every event.\n\nWhy in the hell would I need to be on guard? Lmao\u2026", "More people need to accept that reality. You don't get to know their age. Find a new angle to discredit their view. Some things don't have \"right\" answers. This happens to be one and it sounds like OP is aware they're in a gray area and there's room for growth.", "So you can't read, I see."]}
