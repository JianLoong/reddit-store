Yes I have invited Bethany to do stuff with me, it\u2019s always been a no.\n\nI won\u2019t disown Sabrina by disinviting her to family events, because that is actually I will be saying.

This is asking me to chose between two children, I will not disown one.\n\nPost:\n\nMy son was dating Sabrina, they started in highschool and broke up when they were in college. It was a long relationship and I became really close to her. She is in my eyes our daughter. Her family are awful people and she sees us as her parental figures. She even is planning to have my husband walk her down the isle when she gets married. \n\nNow when they broke up, relationship just died, we didn\u2019t drop her since she is our kid at this point. My son wasn\u2019t happy but moved on, so she gets invited to family events and has for years.  My son now 27 is married to Bethany and she is a nice person. We never clicked, we don\u2019t have much in common and they live 2 hours away so it\u2019s hard to plan stuff to get to know her more. Really I\u2019m sure it will grow in time.\n\nNow we had a picnic and all the family members were invited. So Sabrina was there as normal and I thought the night was nice. Bethany come up to me at the end of the night and expressed that she is uncomfortable with her husband ex being everywhere and if I couldn\u2019t invite her for family stuff. I told her no and that Sabrina is part of the family and has been part of the family longer than she has. If their is an actually valid reason like her rude then I would consider it but she has done nothing.  She left and my son has called me and called me an asshole for picking her over my now real family. \n\nAITA, my husband thinks she is crazy but I know we can be bias.", "created_utc": 1691333634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jrkdu/aita_for_telling_my_sons_wife_that_his_ex_is_in/", "score": 10360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have chosen this girl over your son. Not just his new wife; your son. He was uncomfortable after the breakup, and you ignored him. You don't even talk about your son positively, but you rave about his ex. Thats pretty awful parenting. You're not even trying to befriend his wife, and your son is right to be furious with you about all of this.\n\nGood luck having a relationship with your grandchildren, because I really doubt you're going to have anything to do with them, and it's entirely your fault.", "My family is in a similar situation.

Every time we are around, at group events or just-us visits, my mil brings up how amazing his ex is. She tells anyone who will listen that she wishes her son and his ex had worked things out because she doesn\u2019t like me as much. Bethany will never forget your blatant favoritism. Your son will never forget it either. I\u2019m not saying that Sabrina needs to be uninvited to events.

You think of ex as your daughter and leaving her out of family events will be such a shame. \n\nHowever, you also have to think about things from your DIL point of view.

Knowing that the person he loved is still considered family AND your MIL and FIL like her more than you.. \n\nIn the end it's YTA because your are prioritising ex over SON and DIL.

Her mom was \u201creally good friends\u201d with her ex and invited him to lots of stuff. Always had him bartend their big parties. It took mom going to a therapist who helped her see that the only real reason ex was putting so much time and effort into the friendship was to be around the daughter. They were both still hoping something would work out but my friend was having none of it. She found it really annoying and she wasn\u2019t even married to someone else.

You\u2019re supposed to welcome her into your family and show her respect even if you\u2019re incapable of showing her love.

Family is more than just blood or marriage relation, or whom your kids are dating. It's the time invested in someone, the connection. You're allowed to have your own platonic connections, you're a human being, not just your son's mother. You're allowed to be a person outside of that and have friendships  with people even if your son doesn't want to continue one. You don't need his permission for whom *you* consider family, just like he doesn't need your permission for the same. He's 27, a full grown adult, it's time to develop his EQ and understand he's not the center of your life, and he has no say to whom you invite in your home and neither does his wife.", "Okay definitely gonna be an unpopular opinion but I would say NTA . I also disagree with all the people saying you're picking the ex over the wife/over your son. I've known other families who continue to have relationships with their kids ex's regardless of if the ex has a shitty home/family life or not. And this as been going on for years, before the son got with his wife, if he never voiced and problem with it before now it seems like his only issue is that it makes his wife insecure. Which makes me wonder what he's saying to make her feel that way. Does he talk about the ex a lot? Or compare how close she is to his mom but his wife is not?\n\nI can sympathize with the wife maybe feeling like it's hard to connect with you, if you and the ex are chatting a lot and hanging out with the ex during these events, so I could be helpful to reach out and plan some things for you two to do together so you can grow your relationship without her comparing it to how much easier/better you get along with the ex.", "Little bit YTA. Do you want to be right or do you want to have your son in your life? You\u2019re well on your way to forcing him to choose. If your son plans on having children and you continue not fostering a good relationship with his wife, good luck seeing her children.\n\nIf they live two hours away, you could simply not invite his ex-girlfriend to functions your son will be attending.", "Why would Sabrina want to be around when your son is tonguing Bethany down in front of the entire family ? Yeah Sabrina is psycho and you need to show Bethany more respect.", "Sabrina is not your family and Bethany is. You can choose Sabrina over her if you want but it will most likely cost you your relationship with your son and his WIFE. Only you can decide if it's worth it. No reason you can't see Sabrina separate from family functions.", "NAH. I mean, I can sort of see how it would be uncomfortable for Bethany, but it seems that at this point Sabrina is more of a family friend than your son's ex. As long as everybody keeps civil, there should be no problems, your son doesn't get to decide who YOU get to be friends with.", "I\u2019m going to go NTA\u2026 they were children when they dated and she needed a support system.

In a breakup you sometimes lose friends and similar relationships. It sucks and it\u2019s sad, but you are supposed to get to keep your family. It\u2019s inappropriate for an ex to be at every family event and a constant reminder that you don\u2019t accept the split or his new relationship. It\u2019s fine to be friendly with Sabrina, you don\u2019t have to ignore her, but you\u2019re going to lose your son with this lack of boundaries. Sabrina herself should be giving him and his wife the space they deserve rather than strong arming her way into his family. It\u2019s wildly inappropriate and plain unkind. If she cares about him moving on and being happy, she would be politely declining these invites. \n\nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this honestly. I\u2019ve had exes families want me around, and I\u2019ve had my family want an ex around. In the first case, my response was friendly and appropriate distance. In the second case I politely asked my family to put some boundaries in place so my family would be a safe space without my ex. When they acted like you (the AH), I quit talking to them until they had created an appropriate distance. Best of luck, you gained a daughter and you\u2019ll lose a son for it. You don\u2019t have the moral high ground, and neither does Sabrina. Very very occasional lunch and phone calls with Sabrina. Nothing more, nothing less. She\u2019s not your daughter, you have a son, and he\u2019s married, his wife is your DIL. It\u2019s time to make a choice. You\u2019re lucky you got away with it this long.\n\nEdit: The edit doesn\u2019t make things better, it makes them worse OP. You already *did* \u201cdisown one\u201d - your son. The one place you\u2019re not supposed to have to run into your ex is with your family. The only people in your life that you\u2019re supposed to be able to feel certain will choose you in a break up, is your family. You subjected him to his ex when I\u2019m sure he was hurting and vulnerable after the breakup, and I\u2019m sure there was plenty of times he wanted to be able to say \u201ceff her,\u201d out of frustration and couldn\u2019t because \u201ctsk tsk, she\u2019s our daughter too!\u201d Then you subjected him to her for a decade after. You already told your son how important he is, all you\u2019ve done now is cemented it by further saying, \u201cnot only do your feelings and boundaries not matter to us, neither does your marriage! Team Sabrina!\u201d If it makes you feel any better, Sabrina is no prize either. That\u2019s no way to treat someone, even an ex.", "You ain\u2019t going to see the grandkids\u2026.", "YTA you weirdo. You say you don't want to choose but you are choosing. Like you realize that, right?", "YTA.  My mother couldn't be arsed to accept my wife as part of the family, and my family treated the *mother of my 3 children* like she was garbage.\nMy in-laws have always been gracious and have treated me like family.\nMy mother did the same thing to all 3 of my brother's wives ( yes, divorced 3 times) and he took my mother's side every time, whereas, I stuck by my wife and went NC for over a decade, and LC until my mother passed.\nIf you want your son to become distant, and possibly go no contact, by all means, continue to alienate his wife. \nNote:  This is my one and only marriage, and it's been going for over 30 years.", "INFO\n\nWhat does your son think about having the ex still around for family events?", "YTA. My MIL was the same way, and I hated her for it until the day she died 35 years later. Enjoy your life and no bitching when she goes NC with their kids.", "i think you may have misunderstood, here. seems very likely the option to have both your son and his wife and his ex attend was never there, and you just decided that you\u2019d rather have the ex attend family events than your son. guess you must really love her. i feel very sad for your son. i can\u2019t imagine how i would feel if my parents did that. yta.\n\nedit: not fiance! wife. sorry.", "NTA OP. Within certain contexts I can see this being a problem. With your situation and her family situation taken fully into account I think there is nothing wrong with your decision to continue to include her. She seems to have successfully moved on and so has your son.\nYou and your husband have unofficially adopted her a long time ago and I think it\u2019s time for the adult children to act like adults. Lots of people don\u2019t like certain members of their family. This doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to ask that certain family members should be excluded.", "I used to feel threatened by my ex\u2019s ex when I was a young adult. Im old now and understand relationships differently and am not threatened by these types of relationships anymore.", "If my MIL told me that my hb's ex had been around longer then me so I could suck it any relationship we might have had would be over.\n\nI'd love to hear Bethany's side of this, I'd bet you prioritize Sabrina in ways you don't share here.  Its probably why your actual DIl hasn't been more interested in a relationship with you.\n\nYou can have any relationship you want with anyone you want as long as you accept what that will cost you.  Sons are notorious for deferring to the wife, so if you're ok with not seeing much of you son and actual blood grandchildren then go ahead and keep prioritizing Sabrina.\n\nI hope this ends up being worth the cost.  Sometimes when relationships end we have to choose which ones to keep.   You might be able to chat with Sanrina discreetly on the side but continuing to ram her down your actually DIL's throat is going to cost you.\n\nAnd frankly, it's pretty trashy for Sabrina to ask your hb to walk her down the aisle and to continue to insert herself into your family.  I guarantee she knows Bethany is uncomfortable and she's just fine with that.  Doesn't speak very highly of her.", "NTA-maybe?\n\nIt is an odd dynamic.\n\nIs there any chance your relationship with Sabrina is interfering with a potential relationship with Bethany? \n\nObviously Bethany knows who you prefer, and of course that hurts her feelings.\n\nWill Bethany be less emotionally invested in fostering a relationship between you and her potential children? \n\nNot out of malice, just out of apathy? Visiting must be pretty burdensome for her, and I\u2019m sure there must be concern her potential children will also be kept at arms length. \n\nMaybe not an AH, but I wonder if you won\u2019t suffer the consequences anyway.", "Everyone has views on if you're the AH or not. People saying they need to suck it up and deal with the ex probably wouldn't like it if they were in Bethany or your sons shoes. There are very few people who would be okay with having their ex or their partners' ex around at every family event. That would be very awkward and they wouldn't want to come anymore. I understand that you care for Sabrina, but if I were Bethany or your son, I would cut you off. You said, \"This is asking me to choose between two children, I will not disown one.\" You are choosing between them no matter what you decide. Either way, someone is going to feel less important, understood, and cared for. You could try telling Sabrina you care for her and still want to be a part of her life, but she can't come to every family get-together. You could tell your son and Bethany to suck it up and completely alienate your son, his wife, and potential grandchildren. You might not like it, but don't be mistaken, YOU ARE CHOOSING.", "I want to say N A H but as someone who was a Sabrina, YTA and she kinda is too. I was very close to my ex\u2019s mom to the point where she called me her missing daughter and the daughter she never had. My ex and I broke up, so I distanced myself. There were days I missed that parental figure but I had to let go, she did not have a place in the next chapter of my life. It hurt, as someone who had lost my mom, I cried a lot. Even now I lost two additional mother figures and KNOW it\u2019ll hurt if I have to distance myself from my SOs family if we end things but I would because of the fact I respect them.

I will always pick my daughter-in-laws comfort over the ex. Your choices are making your son\u2019s life harder and it\u2019s not our job to create trouble for our kids. If you\u2019re looking for your son to go LC or NC, then you\u2019re going about it the right way. If your not planning on bonding with future grandkids, stay on the track you\u2019re on. Your son has put the ex behind him, and expressed to you that he isn\u2019t okay with you inviting her to family gatherings. You really need to respect his and your daughter-in-law\u2019s wishes.

And why are you even here when you don\u2019t even care if you\u2019re the asshole?", "YTA, I had a high school sweetheart and was very close with his family. Our relationship also just died because we got older and just grew apart romantically. HOWEVER as much as I am still in contact with his family and on good terms I stopped getting invited and being in the family. Your choice to maintain a relationship with his ex while actively lacking a relationship with his wife is only going to hurt you. He is married to her, she is your daughter by marriage and if they have children they WILL be your blood. Out of everyone your DIL is not the person you should choose not to pick first, because when you are going to lose a relationship with your son and future BLOOD grandchildren over this.\n\nYou say they are two hours away so they do not visit much? Me and my husband live 2.5 hours away from his parents and visit OFTEN.. why? Because his mother treats me like a daughter and I am always excited to visit.

Everyone here has already explained why.\n\nJust don\u2019t be surprised when you don\u2019t see your son much anymore, because this isn\u2019t about Bethany.

What a great way to loose contact with your son and future grandchildren.", "YTA this is about your son your very own son. Frankly you sound like a very inconsiderate mother and MIL.

It is clear to your son that you have chosen someone he has awkward history with that will create difficulties with his current partner. \n\nNot only that, you made it clear that the woman he chose will never be accepted into the family the way his first ex was. I would expect them to continue to withdraw from you. So, you are causing the relationship with your son and his growing to deteriorate.", "YTA\n\nWould you be okay with your husband's ex being to every event because your mother/MIL thinks of them as their kid?", "YTA.

I\u2019m not sure if you just wanted a daughter and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. \n\nAlso, you give an excuse about living 2 hours away from Bethany so it\u2019s hard to get to know her more but we live in a world where it\u2019s easy to FaceTime/video chat or even just text someone.", "YTA If you love Sabrina so much, then grab lunch with her or something.

You say that you guys don't click, and that they're far enough away that you don't have much time to visit them. Now that you know Bethany's uncomfortable with Sabrina being at all the family events, you know that you might be making it even harder to develop a relationship if she's not comfortable coming to family events. Your son might stop coming to family events as much.\n\nAnd then, on the more granular level, YTA for telling Bethany that Sabrina's been 'part of the family for longer than she has.' If she's feeling any sense of inferiority, you've just made your position abundantly clear, and made her insecurities worse, making all of this much harder than it needs to be. That was a really rude way to handle the situation.\n\nIs there room to compromise? Talk to your son and Bethany and explain that you don't want to make them uncomfortable and you're sorry for making it sound like a competition, but you do consider Sabrina family and don't want to cut her off completely.

My family had a very similar situation where my aunt and uncle got divorced but my aunt was so close to all of us and my grandparents that even after they both remarried her and her new husband always came to all our holiday events. We would\u2019ve hated to lose her. Now if you\u2019re constantly harping on their old relationship and we\u2019re being vocal about their reunification id say for sure YTA, but you said yourself you don\u2019t want that. Sabrina doesn\u2019t have active positive parents in her life.  If that\u2019s the role you guys have taken on  I can imagine that would be devastating for her to lose. I would talk to your son. Is he upset with Sabrina being at the events because it makes him uncomfortable? Does he still feel some type of way about seeing her? Or is he upset primarily because SIL is insecure about it? I\u2019m not saying Bethany\u2019s feelings are invalid but they\u2019re married\u2026. Isn\u2019t this the type of baggage that comes up way before marriage? I have so many questions of why this is a problem now. If Sabrina is engaged I assumed her fianc\u00e9 has been at the parties too. Why haven\u2019t Sabrina and Bethany formed an understanding of intentions before the marriage took place?", "INFO: did your son ever express discomfort or offense with Sabrina continuing to join family events before getting with Bethany? or is this only a problem for Bethany?", "You don't seem to be able to comprise with your son.

And makes sure to trot her out at every family function to ensure Bethany always remembers this and knows her place in the OP's heart. \n\nBethany will never, ever, ever be allowed to feel like she comes first over his ex in this family.  The OP is making sure of that.\n\nI hope her son realizes how toxic the OP is for his wife and cuts her off.

At some point they have to accept that the lack of closeness isn't because OP is doing something wrong but because they don't want the closeness.

They started dating at 17 when you met her, and they broke up at 18? OP doesn\u2019t tell us, and I am guessing that\u2019s on purpose. Why?

This means not weekend sleep overs. No baby sitting the grand babies. No grand kids over for Christmas, thanks giving or any other holiday you host. No grand kids at family events. Because if your dil isn\u2019t comfortable around Sabrina she is definitely not going to be comfortable with her children around this woman.\n\nIf you can live with choosing sabrina over your son and future grand kids then continue as you are.

They can\u2019t force this boundary on you. But they can and will stop coming around.\n\nSo in 10 year when your son and his family no longer visit or call.

And if she respects her fianc\u00e9s wish\u2019s and distances herself from this relationship because he is uncomfortable don\u2019t be surprised if your son still wants nothing to do with you because you choose his ex over him and his new wife.", "Your both the AH and NTA. You are aloud to have your own relationships and friendships. You're \nthe AH on the grounds that the longer you keep the ex around the more strain and stress you are going to cause on your relationship with your son and with your new DIL.\n\n\nEdit judgement. YTA. You did chose!! By your edit you have chose the EX (and that is what she is) over your actual child. I hope you can live with no contact (because that is going to happen) with your son and kids he may have in the future. He will not want his EX apart of their lives", "Idk it\u2019s fuckin weird though that\u2019s for sure. I feel bad for Bethany.", "maybe your actual DIL would make more effort to get close to you if you cared whatsoever about her and your son's feelings. she actually tried opening up to you and you were a complete AH about how you responded. you could have been more tactful and empathetic but instead went for the ruthless approach of 'putting her in her place'. you will now alienate your son and DIL because of your favoritism. you could have built a bridge with kindness and understanding so no one would be left out, if you actually cared about your daughter in law. YTA", "YTA..", "I think YTA but if it\u2019s important enough to you than keep inviting her to family events. Your son and DIL do not have to agree with you but you also can\u2019t be shocked or upset when you no longer have a relationship with either of them or their future children if they choose to have them. It doesn\u2019t seem like your DIL made a scene or was rude to you she just left and your son was the one to call you a AH.", "Yta. Hasn't your son been part of your life longer? Choosing Sabrina would also mean choosing her over your son, because Bethany is part of your son's life now. They're a unit. But I guess you've made your choice. Just don't be upset when they return the favor and treat you like you're lesser than family.", "YTA-OP you chose your son\u2019s ex gf over your son. Even before Bethany entered the picture. How do you think son feels over this?  No wonder he was angry and has probably been upset over this for years.", "YTA. And I fully expect that you will be back in a few years claiming ignorance as to why your son and his wife have cut contact and won\u2019t let you see your grandkids. You made your choice.\n\nEdited to add: I just re-read your post and am even more perplexed. Your son and Sabrina were only together in high school and some of college? So this was essentially a teenage relationship? Now I just think that\u2019s straight up weird on your part. If I was in my late twenties and my parents kept forcing me to interact with one of my teenage boyfriends because they couldn\u2019t let go of him, I would say they need therapy. You may need to figure out what\u2019s at the heart of your strange obsession and why it\u2019s worth alienating your own child.", "Not a popular belief but YTA. Yeah family may not just be about blood. I get that. Your son asked you to not invite his ex around to haha then family events. You chose to ignore him. His wife told you it made her uncomfortable and you basically told her you don't care how she feels it's all about what you want. Take a look at your selfish ways.  You never got to know Bethany like you did Sabrina, because you made Bethany and your son a second choice.  Think about it, you could not invite Sabrina to every family gathering, since she lives closer to you and you seem to see her often. Knowing your son and DIL live long distance you choose to make them not want to come home because you invite Sabrina.  They don't invite you to their home probably because you bring up Sabrina all the time because she's your \"daughter.\" \n\nYou could show grace to your son and daughter in law, but you choose not to. You want to be right in your actions no matter what may come. Yes, you all are adults. Bethany acted in an adult way asking you to not invite Sabrina to everything. She was asking you to consider her feelings and you ignored them showing me you don't respect or care to have a relationship with either your son or daughter-in-law. \n\nYour need to make Sabrina your only child is evident. She needed your love when her family wouldn't give it to her. Your savior complex made it to where you gave up your own son to get that high when he no longer needed you. \n\nSo yeah you're a JNMIL and YTA.", "Yta yta yta she's not family never will be. U don't get to disown what's not yours. Ur sons remarried & all ur doing is disrespecting his wife. I can't believe u said u won't disown the ex wtf are you smoking?", "What a humungous AH you are. Imagine choosing some girl over your own child and his wife.\n\nSabrina is not family. She was never your family. Your son and your DAUGHTER IN LAW are actual family. Whether or not you \u201cclick\u201d with her, which I imagine you\u2019re more the reason that never happened than Bethany was.\n\nSabrina has a fiancee now, let her create a family with him. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even reading this and the fact that your husband is going to walk her down to aisle is vile. Time to move on from Sabrina and embrace your actual family otherwise just give up having a relationship with your som if you\u2019re going to prioritize his ex over him and his WIFE.", "YTA I'm guessing Sabrina getting picked over your own son is the reason he is 2 hrs away. My guess is he hasn't been around much since the breakup and can guarantee you will see less and less if you let this go on, even after grandkids show. I wouldn't want my kids seeing my mom doting on my ex instead of my wife/their mom.", "YTA. This is how you lose your son. \n\nWant to have a relationship with Sabrina?  Ok. Not sure that\u2019s the greatest idea, but you can do that if you want. However do things with just you guys. If you keep inviting her to family meals and holidays, this is how you end up losing your son and being a stranger to your grandkids.", "YTA\n\"Really I'm sure it will grow in time\" hahahaha no. You will never have a personal relationship with your dil if you keep shoving his ex in her face. Your son will either stop speaking to you all together or his wife will eventually leave him. Do you genuinely believe any grandchildren you may have would be inteoduced to their dads ex? hahahahahah", "YTA- It\u2019s nerve wrecking meeting your spouses family, saying and doing the right things knowing your are being \u2018evaluated\u2019 and trying to make a good impression. I can\u2019t imagine how shitty and extra hard it would be watching your partners ex who already fits in and is liked by everyone be at home in a space you are trying to fit into. I wouldn\u2019t bother trying to be close to you either, how disrespectful you\u2019ve been to her. Break ups suck for everyone, get over it, she has new family now to marry into she\u2019ll be fine and not alone.", "Absolutely YTA \nHow can you be so delusional? Your relationship with Sabrina is completely inappropriate, and it seems like you are being deliberate about it. \n\nYou might not like your sons new wife as much, but disrespecting her, and by extension him by behaving like you are, is so dysfunctional and childish.\n\nWave goodbye to any future relation to your possible grandchildren if you continue down this path.", "YTA. You are friends with the ex, neither your son nor your DIL are, nor should they be expected to be. But, friends is the key there. She isn't family, she is your friend. Lots of families have this situation, where a friend of the parents isnt a friend of the kids, and so isnt always at every event that features the kids. You're deliberately causing a problem. No, your sons wife doesn't want to hang out with you, that's not unusual. \n\nMake the adult compromise and don't invite an ex to the events where your son and daughter in law are there. They don't live locally, how hard can this be?", "YTA. You have ignored your son's wishes for years and are now neglecting his spouse's feelings on the same person. \n\nPeople aren't pets, although you seem to think they are by how you place ownership on them.

It will be well deserved.", "INFO\n\nIn your edit you write:\n\n>\u201dAlso Sabrina is engaged\u201d\n\nHow does that work? Does husband to be mind your relationship?

Does Sabrina spend much time with his family? \n\nHow do you see the future, given that a whole new person, and their own family, involved?\n\nI\u2019m wondering if Sabrina will grow closer to her actual in-laws, prioritising their family events over yours, and you\u2019ll be left with no son or \u201cdaughter.\u201d", "YTA. Bethany is your actual family now, and if you want it to stay that way then you need to prioritize that relationship. if your friendship with your son\u2019s ex is that important to you, it\u2019s your responsibility to address the issues your son & his wife have with it. listening and taking their feelings seriously will go a long way and is really the only way you\u2019ll have a chance at keeping Sabrina in your life without alienating your actual family members. you will lose your family if you do not put them first.", "YTA", "YTA.. especially you saying \u201cshe has been part of the family longer than she has.\u201d what\u2019s wrong with you.", "OP\u2019s future post: I never get to see my grandkids, my DIL hates me and idk why, they never make an effort.

This should\u2019ve been a non-issue if the parents had acted rationally and adjusted the relationship with the ex at the time of break up.  That isn\u2019t to say they couldn\u2019t have continued to be on friendly terms with the ex, but the OP chose to prioritize feelings for an \u201cadopted\u201d daughter over the feelings of her own son.  That makes her YTA.  There\u2019s a lot of wiggle room in maintaining a relationship that didn\u2019t have to include subjecting her son to seeing his ex again and again over the years, and if/when the son decides to exercise his right to prioritize his in-laws\u2019 visitations with the grandchildren over the OP, it will be well deserved.", "Hope Op will be happy with her relationship with S and doesn\u2019t mind losing her relationship with grandkids.", "Basically OP is choosing her over her son.

If that sounds weird as hell, so is this.", "literally this.  and most of these comments are ignoring that the son is unhappy too. i feel like everyone is ignoring the son's position because they like to harp on the jealous woman stereotype.  it's not an issue with bethany being worried about sabrina hurting her relationship with her partner at all and that is extremely clear from the son's position.  \n\nit's because OP is totally disrespecting their relationship. and if i were son i'd be uncomfortable to be around my ex so much too. \n\nthe two of them can't even escape the sabrina favoritism in this post", "You are absolutely right!\n\nI hope the ex gets a petty streak at the next family event.\n\nAnd it goes do you care to pass the max n cheese Sabrina to your brother( op\u2019s son) Oh is that creepy I call him your brother since you two had sex? \n\nHey tell me when you all had sex did he do xyz or is that something new he learned?\n\nWhen mil complains I would just tell her I am bonding over common ground with her daughter.\n\nI promise I make Sabrina so uncomfortable she get the point.

Huge YTA", "She was wrong when she kept OPs ex in their family life when her son explicitly said he didn't like it after they broke up. It's insane that she did that. I understand it's very difficult to navigate at this point, but now she is never going to live in a world where everyone is happy. She needs to acknowledge that keeping his ex around will drive him away. \n\nIt's not \"insecure\" to feel uncomfortable with your spouses ex around. Its completely normal and almost every single person on earth can relate to this. OP is asking her daughter in law to just live the rest of her life uncomfortable around their family. She is explicitly telling her that she will not be family, so that her husband's ex can be.", "Yeah, OP is never seeing that grandkid.

Even the fact that they are not geographically close, may hint at the son's reluctance to be constantly in that orbit.   \n\nIt's the OP who has chosen to view Bethany's request as threatening her \"family\" when it is probably her insistence on including Sabrina that has created a lot of distance between them.   Why would Bethany want to go 1:1 with OP to listen to how Sabrina is just like a daughter when Bethany knows that her husband doesn't view her as anything like a sibling or even a friend?", "I think that\u2019s the problem\u2014OP doesn\u2019t give a shit about Bethany or her son\u2019s feelings on the matter.", "I just want to know why they broke up.

That's just dramatic BS you're introducing. Just because the \"adopted ex\" is not invited to a single family get-together doesn't mean they've been abandoned. And the reasons are quite valid and practical - inviting them over ALSO makes your son, your child, deeply uncomfortable because it is ALSO his ex GF and he is now married to another woman.\n\nThe level of absurdity here is staggering.\n\nLet me make this crystal clear. This is a parent who is making decisions that are deeply uncomfortable to their own child. OK, you can continue to have a relationship with your son's ex, but it is utterly absurd that you show ZERO acknowledgement that this IS your son's ex and instead you're now making this out to be \"your adopted daughter vs your son\" kind of a thing.\n\nThat's terribly unfair on your own son, someone you raised from childhood. Especially when the entire reason you know this other person IS because of your son. To show such little consideration for your own son is appalling.", "The fact is that when Sabrina gets married and lives with her husband, the relationship with OP will lighten a bit.

MIL from hell. I would make sure we move countries to get away from such weird energy.", "My thoughts exactly. YTA. That's super weird. It's fine to think of her as a daughter on your own, it's weird to think that to the point of inviting them to family events, especially this one.", "I completely agree. A parent has only 1 responsibility and that is to your OWN kid. It was nice of OP to be a surrogate mother when Sabrina had a relationship with her son, but when the relationship ended, so should have ended her contact with Sabrina. It is outrageous to keep in contact with your son's ex when he broke up with her. It's a total lack of support towards her own son.\n\nSorry OP, but YTA.

Who tf invites their married child\u2019s ex to every family event? That is disgusting. I can\u2019t imagine what your son\u2019s feeling. You are being a horrible mother as well as a horrid MIL. Honestly I don\u2019t think your DIL really cares about you or your opinion at all. She probably has a very low opinion of you but chose to come talk to you about the issue for her husband, your son. You can\u2019t even recognize that and shuts her down and goes on reddit to complain about her. You will lose your son soon. If I was the son and my mom constantly made my family uncomfortable and disrespected them I would cut ties with her.", "I think OP is the AH because her son expressed he was also uncomfortable with it. Let's read in between the lines for a change.\n\nOP states that Sabrina and her son were together in highschool and ended things in college, she never specified how long it lasted, so for all we know it could've been a 1 yr relationship. So she spends time with an ex that wasn't even there for a long time. Even if they were together all throughout highschool, that still doesn't pass the time test.\n\nOP spends time with Sabrina for about a decade, meaning, she even invited Sabrina over when the break up was still fresh. This is incredibly unfair to the son because he is not given space to be away from Sabrina. His mom constantly has her over for family events (can include birthdays, so imagine birthdays + holidays with your ex who you are not comfy with), this is unfair to the son.\n\nSabrina was not even a childhood friend, she was just some girl he dated in highschool, and the mom clung to her for 10 yrs despite her son's protests. It sucks Sabrina had a shitty home life (which is also extremely vague, like everything else in the post), but that doesn't mean she has to be in every single family event. \n\nThis whole posts reads to me like OP is choosing her son's ex over her own son, actual daughter in law, and possible future grandkids (I read somewhere that in a previous edit, OP had stated the DIL was pregnant). The son and DIL have both stated they are not comfortable with this, and the son had even stated he was uncomfy with this even before being with DIL, and the mom ignored him.\n\nOP is TA.", "Right? I\u2019m so sick of parents doing this. Your child broke up with someone, unfortunately for you, you have to break up w them too!", "Eh, will she though?\n\nShe broke up with OPs son half a decade ago and yet she's still attending his family functions. . .with her FI now.", "I wonder how many partners have come and gone before Bethany because of this exact issue. Curious.", "Eh, I can relate to this so I think some families just are different. My friends dad is very close to her ex from hs. They hang out and golf at least once a week. They broke up about 4 years ago after dating for close to 10 years. My friend is single and doesnt mind though that they are close which I think makes the situation not really comparable.\n\nOne of my former aunts is always at all of our family events too. Originally it was just to come with her kids but they are all adults now and we all still invite her. I know my uncle\u2019s second wife hates it but my former aunt is pretty amazing and he cheated on her so we didn\u2019t see the need to stop associating with her because he was a dick. \n\nOne of my bridesmaids was my cousin\u2019s ex-gf. We were raised more like siblings and so I got close to his gf when they dated. After they broke up he wanted me to stop hanging out with her and I refused. His wife hates this and refuses to come to any events at my house because my friend will be invited. \n\nWhen a relationship ends, not everyone else has to stop being friends too. The fact that the woman wants OPs husband to walk her down the aisle shows this isn\u2019t some superficial relationship. They actually have become family.", "That\u2019s what Bethany did at/after the picnic. It\u2019s clearly something that Bethany\u2019s husband did as well at some point, as OP has acknowledged that he \u201cwasn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d OP doesn\u2019t care and wants to be oblivious because she wants to keep playing surrogate mommy for an adult woman.", "I get the first part completely but OP sounds waaayyyy too self righteous about her sons high school gf and she dgaf that it\u2019s super weird for her son and his wife. Sorry but old h.s. GF is also a weirdo for showing up to every holiday etc knowing she\u2019s making the actual son and his wife uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in anyone\u2019s position here - OP, ex HS GF, wife, or son. OP can have a relationship with her sons old gf from his teen years separately and not in the face of son and wifey. She\u2019s made her choice and the golden child is her sons high school flame? Come on.", "Honestly in a way whether it was a short or long relationship seems the same to me. If my parents decided they were going to maintain a long relationship with one of my exes, regardless of how long my relationship with them was, I would be livid. It would be their choice, but I would not attend functions anymore if my ex is in attendance. I don\u2019t want to be constantly in touch with an ex or reminded of a failed relationship. I doubt most people want that. It\u2019s not healthy.\n\nMy sis divorced a few years ago. I really liked my BIL but I can objectively understand that maintaining any contact with him would have been really weird and inappropriate. (They didn\u2019t have kids so there would be no reason to imagine that I might run into him due to their shared custody or something. It was a clean split.) It would have hurt my sister and probably him too. \n\nOP, YTA. If you insist on maintaining this relationship, you need to do it on your own time. Don\u2019t push your son or his wife to accept it. They are right to find it inappropriate and hurtful.", "I don\u2019t think the length of the relationship matters, either. I\u2019m just pointing out that I think she\u2019s being vague about it in attempt to make it look less weird, as I think the length would impact the judgment for some people.\n\nThe moment the son expressed discomfort in the beginning of the post breakup relationship, that should have been it.\n\nOP has been the AH ever since, at the very least. \n\nBut the truth is, she probably meddled in this relationship while it was happening.", "Especially if your partner has made it clear to you they are uncomfortable with the situation and the mom doesn't care about their feelings.\n\nThey care about this girl more than their son, what chance do you have at that point?", "Oh for sure, I figured. Tbh to an extent I\u2019m just globbing on to the biggest YTA comment lol, but yeah I agree with you.", "Yeah, I was a son in almost the exact same situation. It really messed up our whole family, and I lost the \"safe\" feeling you're supposed to get from your mom and your family home. Moved away for 10 years before the girl ditched her anyways. Family is chosen, but you can choose your flesh and blood if you actually care about them. I was forced to look elsewhere. It's better now, but our relationship will never be the same and those years can't be gotten back.", "You\u2019re not cynical. OP is a crazy person.", "Yep. Agreed.
