I (26F) am getting married in a few months, and I'm facing a difficult decision that has caused a rift between me and my brother (28M), let's call him Alex. Alex and I have always been close, but we have had some disagreements in the past, mostly about his son, who is on the autism spectrum. I'll call him Max.\n\nMax is a sweet boy who is seven years old and has high-functioning autism. He is mostly non-verbal and has sensory issues that can make him uncomfortable in loud or crowded environments. Alex and his wife have always done their best to accommodate Max's needs, but they also want him to have as normal a life as possible, so they often bring him to family events and outings.\n\nI've never had a problem with Max before, but I'm starting to worry about how he will behave at my wedding. We are planning a relatively formal affair with about 150 guests, most of whom Max has never met. The venue is a bit noisy and bright, and we will have a DJ playing music for most of the night. I'm concerned that Max might get overwhelmed or upset, which could disrupt the event or cause him distress.\n\nI've talked to Alex about my concerns, and he was understandably upset. He accused me of discriminating against Max because of his disability and said that he couldn't believe I would exclude his son from such an important family event. He also said that he and his wife would do whatever it takes to make sure Max behaves appropriately and doesn't disturb anyone.\n\nHowever, I'm not convinced that Alex can guarantee Max's behavior, and I don't want to take any chances on my big day. I've already invested a lot of time and money into planning this wedding, and I don't want anything to ruin it. I suggested that Alex and his wife hire a babysitter or ask a trusted family member to take care of Max during the wedding, but Alex refused, saying that he wants to be there for me and that Max deserves to be part of the celebration.\n\nNow Alex and I are at a stalemate. He says that he won't come to the wedding if Max isn't welcome, and I'm torn between my love for my brother and my desire for a peaceful and memorable wedding. I don't know what to do.

Most children are going to be tired and over stimulated by a nighttime event especially since the hours proceeding it will be stressful as well - they have to get dressed - probably in relatively uncomfortable clothing - drive - be quiet for the ceremony and then almost certainly be eating past their normal dinner time plus saying up late.\n\nI think one of the reasons that people now specify child free weddings is because in the past children simply weren't expected to attend this kind of night time adult party. Children might turn up at a relatively informal afternoon wedding party.'\n\nI don't mean to sound like a curmudgeon but I don't remember going to any formal weddings as a kid or even a formal restaurant.

On site babysitter who could step in and take care of the kid(s) when it was too late in the night or too much. You're setting a precedent for the rest of your family to follow.

Tools that can help ensure he\u2019d be more calm given he\u2019s prone to overstimulation. Maybe even find a quiet area at your venue and show it to your brother. \n\nAlso, if your nephew becomes disruptive, I doubt that your brother would just allow that to continue rather than taking him from the venue to calm down.

The likelihood of one of the other children acting up is just as possible.", "YTA, just wow. You are so worried he will cause a distraction and ruin your wedding. I can tell you too many people will be busy enjoying your wedding they won't be bothered by a child being overwhelmed and may not even notice it. Your brother and his wife will remove him from the area if it gets too much for him. Don't be surprised when you don't see your brother there.", "YTA. You are providing hypotheticals and jumping to conclusions. Based on your description the worst case scenario is he gets uncomfortable and his parents take him away from the stimulation. No one will notice. No one will care. Not to take away from your big day but no one gives a shit what happens at weddings. All I remember from mine is that it went well and all the people we wanted there were having a good time.

I don't understand all the YTA votes. You are concerned that the venue and event will pose sensory issues for the child. The parents can't guarantee this won't happen - and in that event: Max won't be happy, the parents won't be happy, and potentially you and your guests won't be happy. I would have thought a reasonable compromise would be for Max to perhaps skip the wedding ceremony and try the reception - hoping the parents would take Max outside or someplace quiet should the DJ and other environmental factors prove to be too much.", "ESH. Can't you come to a compromise? I could see a meltdown disrupting the ceremony of actually being married.. but can't he come to the reception? Like you said, there will already be a ton of noise and commotion. If it is too much for your nephew then your brother can remove him without much disturbance. Maybe see if he is willing to have someone watch your nephew during the ceremony and have on stand by if the reception proves too much.", "YTA. What message does it send to Max that his own aunt didn't want him at her wedding? Whether he can verbalize it or not, kids notice stuff like that.

Surely he knows the sensory overload stress that child might experience could be devastating.", "NTA.  You deserve a quiet peaceful wedding if that is what you want.  Despite what your brother says there is NO GUARANTEE they can keep his behavior in check, there is also likely a disconnect between what your brother considers appropriate and acceptable behavior.  This holds true for all children not just your nephew.  Ive seen some kids start crying and the parents eventually remove the child but stand in the vestibule & with the doors open the wailing overshadowed every portion of the ceremony.  \n\nAlso at a reception a tantrum-ing out of control child can demolish cake decorations turn candles over & set fire.\n\nIm sorry your brother wont budge.  Most likely your nephew wont remember your wedding. Do you remember anything from when you were 7?  And your nephew wont know he''s not included in the wedding unless his parents make a big to do about it.  They could easily plan a day of age appropriate fun for him away from the wedding, they get a break to enjoy childfree time, and then you could have a stress free wedding.\n\nI know you have had alot of YTA but please remember at one point everyone thought the world was flat, and people who disagreed were killed for being blasphemous.  So just because the masses  say something doesnt always mean it is correct.\n\nFor all the people who said weddings dont have to be perfect and you should get over it,  thats great for them.  But i highly doubt any of them have had to endure an out of control non verbal child having a tantrum at their weddings.  It can be very traumatic for others to witness and would definitely kill the positive vibe of your wedding.\n\nSo i hope your brother will change his mind. If he doesnt you have a hard decision to make.  And if you choose not to include your nephew it will impact your relationship w your brother.   But in my opinion if he were being loving and supportive of you he would look at the whole picture and realize yhat this is not the best environment for his child.  All the overstimulating sights sounds smells may be overwhelming and your nephew would truly not be harmed by having a fun age appropriate activity away from the wedding that he would enjoy & he would forget about the wedding (if he is even thinking about it.
