Are you mad at yourself for publishing that rant online instead of in your paper journal?\n\nYTA for expecting no one would be concerned about you.", "YTA you make a post that sounded like a suicide note - you gave them only one option, call EMS and have a welfare check done.", "YTA  \n\n\nYour friend tried to help you when, as you admit, you had mental health issues. They were being the best friend you could've hoped for and actually did something when they were concerned for you, not just leaving you when they thought you could hurt yourself.   \n\n\nThis sounds like it's part of your mental health issues, mostly for the fact you can't see they were trying to help you. Your friend doesn't deserve crap because they *tried to look out for you*, they deserve a beer and a \"thank you\".   \nThis is one of the instances that you can learn about your own mental health and the issues you need to deal with personally, except this time you can get some opinions from other people. Now the choice is whether to accept you messed up a bit and fix it, getting better at handling your personal stuff while repairing your relationship, or not and letting your mental health get worse as things feel increasingly like personal attacks.", "YTA\nTheir intentions are good and you shouldn't be upset at them, you should be upset at the police for not doing it in a better way. Your friend cares about you", "I am hesitant to call you an Asshole. It seems like your best friend had good intentions, but the end result was harmful to you during a time when you were already feeling vulnerable. It's difficult to know what would have happened if the police had not been involved, or if your best friend had reached out to you personally instead. But you are entitled to your feelings and I don't think you are completely wrong to feel a little betrayed by your best friend.", "\nNAH\n\nSocial media isn't the right place, as you've discovered, for venting what may sound like serious mental distress unless you're prepared for the results that happened.\n\nIt scares people. They feel they must act quickly but don't know the \"right\" thing to do. So things happen.", "ESH,  They could have done it in a better way but they came clean meaning they know they did something wrong. They feel guilty about it and want forgiveness. These are the kind of friends you can trust. They care about you. Get over it and be grateful you have people like this to call you out on your shit. Never go on social media when you are upset. That shit is permanent.", "ESH\n\nYou are right to be angry, but you are angry at the wrong person.\n\nGet angry about a system that treats a welfare call to people with potential mental health issues as if they are a criminal.  \nThe system is wrong, not your friend for being concerned about you", "**NTA** \\- Don't ever call the cops for a wellness check unless you want to harm the person being checked upon.   For whatever reason, the cops in America are scared to death. Every encounter is a life and death situation.  When you call for a wellness check on somebody, you are just doing it for yourself, not for them.\n\nOP, everything you ever write on online, in social media, in email, in text is available forevermore.  In the future, a DA, or an estranged spouse, may use it against you.  Be very careful about what you publish.", "NTA\n\nSwatting is real and people die. US cops are poorly trained and universally believe they are fighting a war, not \u201cupholding the peace\u201d. And then your friend never asked. \n\nSame time, said friend may have thought it was the best way to get you the help you needed and were asking for. Friend may have been embarrassed when nothing happened. \n\nThat said, you have every right to your anger", "NAH\n\nYour friend was worried about you and your well being, so they had a wellness check performed. Unfortunately, your friend is correct that police are *not* well trained for this.  Regardless, their intentions were good.\n\nI can also understand you feeling very uncomfortable about how it went down once the police arrived.", "NTA who tf calls the cops and NOT the friend? even if they were scared for you, they could have called the cops first and hen you. but this is nonsense.", "NAH, she wasn't well prepared to deal with the situation you were in - most people aren't, so she turned to the one resource she knew will respond fast. If you weren't able to get a doctor for 6 months, how was she supposed to get you an actual supportive person when it seemed the situation was an emergency. \n\nI actually lived in a co-op for a semester and had similar situation, there were 15 of us trying to call for wellness check or suicide prevention organization or anything that's not a police  - for like 8 hours all together and couldn't. So many organizations but they would route us to each other and keep citing the police as the fastest and surest option if we press them so that's what we needed up doing eventually even though we were extremely reluctant to call police", "NTA. Calling the cops on someone is not a safe situation. You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get involvarily committed and get a record which could fuck up your life. \n\nIt shows you can\u2019t trust your friend. I\u2019d have a very hard time moving forward with them. Up to you if you want to keep them in your life, but I\u2019d at least need a lot of distance for a long time.", "NTA he didn't even call you to check on you.", "NTA. And ffs make an anonymous account with fake name to vent about such things.

And your friend's response is understandable.\n\nIt sounds like you need to have another conversation with your friend. Ask them why they didn't reach out personally at the time. Ask them, also, what he meant about \"multiple people\" contacting them to ask if you were okay. Because whilst they acted in a way which admittedly could have gone wrong, they acted. You are questioning why they didn't reach out personally but you aren't questioning why the others didn't reach out to you either. And the answer could be as simple as your friend didn't want to make your situation worse and they thought trained professionals would be best placed to help you.\n\nNAH", "NTA- anyone who will call the cops before calling you is a complete AH, ignorance is no excuse when common sense suffices.", "YTA - Not because it seems that you desperately needed a dr's appt for your mental health issues, couldn't get one; but when you posted your rant, you escalated things. You didn't go to the nearest emergency room with a mental health Dr. You ranted publicly. Your friend did exactly what they were supposed to. Now, it's up to you to acknowledge & communicate. \nI hope your mental health is in a better place now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sending cops to check up on someone who is mentally distraught is a quick way to get your friend murdered by cops.\n\nPolice protect and serve the community by keeping it safe.

I can totally understand OP being upset about it, but at least friend cared enough to do something.", "Again, cops need trained better for mental health checks. They do save lives if trained properly, I've seen it happen personally. Worrying about someone and wanting to help them doesn't make them an AH at all.

Don't throw that away.", "Calling no one is often better.", "I see your point, but I still think that if the friend was not 'fit' enough to offer comfort or whatever, they had a bunch of better options, e.g. inform a mutual friend or a family member and ask to check in on OP.
