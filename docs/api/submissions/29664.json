Who cares if you thought a hammer fell on her head.  It very well could of.  It doesn't mean it was a square blow, it could have glanced off the side of her head and therefore didn't cause any damage.  The point is, who knows.  It scared you, and you care about your cat, and you just wanted to share that with him.\n\nThe real question is, why is your boyfriend so offended over something that literally has 0 impact on him?  Sounds like projection.\n\nNTA", "Ummm... wut.\n\nFirst, by landing on her head, you could've meant a plethora of things. It didn't have to be the head of the hammer on the first fall, coming in hot. Could've been a bounce, could've been the handle, could've grazed her. All of those would still count as a hit to the head.\n\nMore importantly. Why is he reacting like this over this conversation? What you perceived as a possibility is not inarguable truth, but that doesn't mean he has to argue that it's patently wrong. While what he is saying has a bit of merit (\"don't speak as an authority when you don't actually know\"), he didn't have to take it to the point of upsetting you, and then *keep going.*\n\nHe is clearly upset about other things, or is not a great guy in general. I'd try to consider what has got him all in a tizzy. If this is persistent behavior, than either you need some relationship counseling, he needs counseling, or you might want to start looking for an out.", "NTA\n\nIf this is a one off and he's *never* done anything remotely like this before then quit reading. But if this is a pattern, or not the first time he's attacked you over something so small, please keep reading. Because, these are major abuse tactics. \n\n\n>He said he wanted to let me know these things because people might start thinking badly of me and he didn't want to see that\n\nYes, he does. He wants you to second guess yourself until you stop talking to other people or start coming across like a weirdo who can't stop second guessing herself to them. It gives him power and makes you reliant on his opinion over your own. \n\n>that I was being a girl who cried wolf by not saying the hammer fell \"beside\" her or \"maybe it got caught on her fur and scared her.\" He said that people would start thinking badly of me or calling me a liar,\n\nHe's the only one calling you a liar. 99/100 responses would be, \"Omg, I hope your cat is okay?\" He's lying to you to make you feel confused and small. So you doubt your reactions and beliefs. \n\n>By the end of it all I just wanted to drop the conversation but he kept going and going until he saw that I was really offended\n\n>he stormed off and hasn't come back.\n\nFirst, he drove you into silence by continuing to attack you. Then he left and refused to return to make you feel like your reaction was unwarranted and so you'd sit there and wonder what you've done wrong (FYI: nothing). You're now concerned that *you* have upset *him*. That's pure gold to a controlling abuser. \n\nThis guy is abusing you and I do not say that lightly. He's applying all of the major strategies people use to wear down their partners and make them so insecure that they'll only trust their abusers pov, never their own. Please, please, get out if you feel that's possible, but at least start talking to a therapist about this. A good therapist can help see the danger signs and help you get out if you need it.

I'm not sure why he chose this to gaslight you but something else is going on here. Not only did he call you a liar but he said other people would too. \"They'll start to see you badly.\" How? For caring about the well being of an animal, you're supposed to love and take care of. You weren't blaming him, and he jumped on the defensive; gaslighting you instead of caring about the animal that can't speak for itself when injured. Did he leave that hammer out? If so, he needs to be responsible and own up to his mistake.", "NTA.\n\nWhat on earth? He's acting like you accused him of roasting said cat for dinner! You suggested a likely scenario, and one that was an *accident*. The important thing is that your cat is okay, not necessarily specifically how it occurred.\n\nAnd why would anyone think badly of you? If you say \"my cat knocked a hammer off a table\" they're not going to freak out and call you a liar and never believe anything you say ever again.", "NTA Your partner is really overanalyzing this. It's perfectly fine to say that you heard a loud bang, there was your cat and a hammer on the floor, therefore you were worried she got hit by the hammer. He needs to find bigger hills to die on because good lord. The only reason I understand is if you constantly ARE embellishing/lying and being the girl who cried wolf", "NTA.  You found an accident, you told your partner about the accident, and then he blew up for no reason.\n\nI have an out-in-left-field concern.  If he had that many things to say about what \"people would think\"  and \"maybe it got caught on her fur\"  he is hiding something.  Maybe it's just him avoiding guilt for the accident.  Maybe it's guilt about something more serious.\n\n> He said he wanted to let me know these things because people might start thinking badly of me and he didn't want to see that. \n\nWhy does he think you'd even tell anybody?

That\u2019s a totally normal thought and everyone would go \u201cyeah probably\u201d.

It\u2019s human nature to relay the intentions behind what we said or did, Vs what the other person\u2019s words or actions were so I was just wondering. \n\nIt\u2019s strange for him to be ranting and so angry about something that didn\u2019t even happen, and my response would probably be that I never said that.
