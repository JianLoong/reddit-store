We have split custody of them and also our baby son who is breastfed. \n\nEvery Saturday the older kids have an activity from 11-1 that my SO drops them off for. It's about a 25 minute round trip. I always wait until SO and the kids have used the bathroom for showers etc before I have mine, because they need to leave at 10:45 and I don't. \n\nOccasionally my elderly FIL pops round on a Saturday for a catch-up and a coffee. He is aware of the kids' schedule, it's been long-standing since they were very small.\n\nHe and SO arranged for him to come over for coffee today; he usually arrives around 11:30. For some reason today he arrived at about 10:30 while I was in the shower and SO was getting the kids ready. \n\nSO welcomed him in and made him a coffee, and explained he would shortly be taking the kids to their activity session and that I was showering, after which it would be time to feed the baby because he was clearly hungry. The baby usually feeds for about 20 minutes. \n\nHe asked FIL if he would be okay sitting in our living room with his coffee while he dropped the kids off, and that he would be back ASAP. FIL said that was fine.\n\nAs I was getting out of the shower SO brought me the baby and filled me in on the plan. He told me FIL knew I would be upstairs feeding the baby and getting dressed, and that there was no rush because he would be back soon.\n\nSo I stayed upstairs and fed the baby, got dressed and was in the process of drying my hair when I heard our front door open, a short conversation and then the door shutting again. \n\nSO came upstairs visibly annoyed and said FIL had stormed out when he got back, saying it was clear nobody had time for him. SO tried to invite him back in but he ignored him, got in his car and drove off.\n\nI apologised to SO for not going downstairs, but said I had just finished feeding the baby and getting dressed and was being as quick as I could. He said it wasn't my fault and that FIL knew I would be busy, and that he was probably annoyed at SO, not me. But to be honest I feel like it is probably me he's angry with. \n\nSO texted him apologising for leaving him on his own, but that this particular time on a Saturday is always busy and it couldn't really be helped. He said next time he'll make sure they arrange a specific time so we can all catch up properly without distractions, to have a good day and that we'll see him soon. \n\nFIL texted him back saying simply \"There is no excuse for poor manners.\"\n\nI understand that we may be TA because he was sat in our living room on his own and I would probably be annoyed by that as a guest. Though as a guest I would probably make sure I turned up at a time that everyone would be home. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696677305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1723wn3/aita_for_leaving_fil_downstairs_while_i_fed_my/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
