I always wait until SO and the kids have used the bathroom for showers etc before I have mine, because they need to leave at 10:45 and I don't. \n\nOccasionally my elderly FIL pops round on a Saturday for a catch-up and a coffee. He is aware of the kids' schedule, it's been long-standing since they were very small.\n\nHe and SO arranged for him to come over for coffee today; he usually arrives around 11:30. For some reason today he arrived at about 10:30 while I was in the shower and SO was getting the kids ready. \n\nSO welcomed him in and made him a coffee, and explained he would shortly be taking the kids to their activity session and that I was showering, after which it would be time to feed the baby because he was clearly hungry. The baby usually feeds for about 20 minutes. \n\nHe asked FIL if he would be okay sitting in our living room with his coffee while he dropped the kids off, and that he would be back ASAP. FIL said that was fine.\n\nAs I was getting out of the shower SO brought me the baby and filled me in on the plan. He told me FIL knew I would be upstairs feeding the baby and getting dressed, and that there was no rush because he would be back soon.\n\nSo I stayed upstairs and fed the baby, got dressed and was in the process of drying my hair when I heard our front door open, a short conversation and then the door shutting again. \n\nSO came upstairs visibly annoyed and said FIL had stormed out when he got back, saying it was clear nobody had time for him. SO tried to invite him back in but he ignored him, got in his car and drove off.\n\nI apologised to SO for not going downstairs, but said I had just finished feeding the baby and getting dressed and was being as quick as I could. He said it wasn't my fault and that FIL knew I would be busy, and that he was probably annoyed at SO, not me. But to be honest I feel like it is probably me he's angry with. \n\nSO texted him apologising for leaving him on his own, but that this particular time on a Saturday is always busy and it couldn't really be helped. He said next time he'll make sure they arrange a specific time so we can all catch up properly without distractions, to have a good day and that we'll see him soon. \n\nFIL texted him back saying simply \"There is no excuse for poor manners.\"\n\nI understand that we may be TA because he was sat in our living room on his own and I would probably be annoyed by that as a guest.

We were getting ready to leave and I fed the baby. We were going to get breakfast and I wanted the baby to be full.  Let me mention we were in NC on an island at one end.  So we discussed where to go for food.  We drove two cars so they needed gas and we figured we would top off too.  I asked again where do we want to eat.  FIL says I want a sausage biscuit I\u2019m like ok we can go to, and list off a bunch of places.  He says no I want a Hardee\u2019s biscuit, mind you there\u2019s no Hardee\u2019s in all of Nag\u2019s Head, this was 25 years ago.  He says well we can keep driving I know I saw one.  We get to the visitors center and I tell my ex we need to stop because I need to use the bathroom and the baby needs to eat.  While I\u2019m feeding the baby my FIL had the audacity to say the baby has eaten twice and I haven\u2019t eaten at all.  I lost it I told him we would\u2019ve eaten already if he wasn\u2019t looking for a restaurant that wasn\u2019t on our route home.  He then says how about IHOP? Did you see an IHOP? No it\u2019s stacks, pancake heaven and the like.  I don\u2019t want those I want an IHOP.  I turned around got in the car and told my ex to drive.  I had snacks to munch on so I was ok.  We finally needed to stop for gas and this station had a Burger King attached.  I said I\u2019m going inside with the baby to get something to eat.  Ex says what about them I don\u2019t think they like BK.  I don\u2019t care they don\u2019t have to eat.  Needless to say FIL had his stupid biscuit and coffee, he also realized he needed to keep his trap shut or I would rip him a new one.  And yes I fed the baby again.  The entire weekend was small events like this.  My MIL would just let him have his way so she never expected me to talk to him the way I did.  She explained to away as still hormonal from having the baby.  No he plucked my ever loving last nerve and the baby was an angel compared to him.

FIL is not on your list because he is an adult and responsible for his own well being.\n\nYour SO needs to tell his dad thate is an empty nester and he needs to find his own activities with people his own age.  He can volunteer, joins the men\u2019s club at church, start a new hobby where he can meet people who share his interests.  There are many opportunities for men to volunteer like the local police department or sheriff\u2019s office use volunteers to assist officers with community outreach such as crowd control at parades, manning the booth at county events or at some depts with extra classes, doing wellness checks on seniors.  Most of the volunteers are older men FILs age.  If FIL lives on his own, he should look at moving to a senior living community where there are social activities and amenities.  My FIL loved it because he found a poker group to join, and they would be mens only outings.\n\nYou and your So need to sit down and discuss changing when you want FIL to come over.  He came an hour early on a busy day for you and SO and he got angry, when he was the one to come early.  If FIL wants to visit when it\u2019s not convenient for youor oa busy day for your family, then SO needs to get comfortable politely, but firmly saying sorry, dad, but Saturday doesn\u2019t work for us.  Sunday after is better. You and SO were trying to fit him into your busy schedule.  Stop.  Say, sorry, but that day doesn\u2019t work for us and then you propose to him a different day.  \n\nIf he has a hissy fit, that is on him not you.  He is being unreasonable.  He is trying to treat you like children that he can command.  You are not children, you are adults with adult responsibilities. He is estranged from his other kids because he refuses to treat them with respect. He disrespected you and your SO today.", "In that case, FIL is most definitely a donkey hole.", "There is no excuse for poor manners but he is the one that didn't have any,", "Looks like GrandPA likes the draMA !!", "[removed]", "It certainly looks that way! NTA", "Spot on assessment", "Yeah, sounds like it. Maybe Gramps needs to get a life.", "Gramps is used to doing whatever he wants whenever he wants, and everybody catering to him no matter how inconvenient. Wake up , Gramps, your kids have their own lives!", "I seriously hope none of them have kids.", "Yes! \u201cYou\u2019re right, it is poor manners to show up an hour early.\u201d", "With an attitude like his a houseplant should outrank grandpa", "Servants and enslaved people are in fact two different things.", "Ok I\u2019m\nGlad to hear it. You\u2019re fully NTA. You did everything fine. I hope you and your baby are ok.", "Sometimes early dementia can be very subtle. My mom passed HER first test too.", " those capacity assessments don\u2019t catch stuff early. My dad was cleared to drive when everyone around him knew he was not.", "Then with all due respect, he needs to stick to the schedule or don't bother showing up.", "See, that's a brilliant idea. In my experience there is a large subset of people who arrive early to parties who will jump at the chance to help the host.", "No, he's 89 and has oedematous feet", "Hahaha good point. Either way, you can't win.", "My son is a very easy baby thankfully and the kids are super helpful and sweet so I'm lucky \ud83e\udd70", "Not relevant here. She wants to know if she is the AH for leaving grumpy gramps downstairs. If he has some issue, hubby should deal with that.", "Nice. East Midlands!", "A Grampa Drama Llamma!", "We're good, thank you \ud83d\udc96", "I've even sent him to take the dog for a walk before. He's a good sport.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 right", "Cool, lived in Wolverhampton for a while Merridale,"]}
