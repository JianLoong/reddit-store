We were all getting along fine and the night was good. My friend came along after work as we were leaving to meet her girlfriend. We all decided to walk another friend home as we didn\u2019t want them travelling alone. Everything was fine until my boyfriend and her began talking behind us about something and I overhear her asking him if he has an issue with my outfit because she would. \nHe then comes up behind me and pulls my skirt to what i assume is an acceptable level. I was just ignoring it as I was hoping it was a one off comment but asked my bf if he had said anything which he denied being the reason he did anything. \n\nThen about 10 or so minutes pass with us walking and she turns to go my boyfriend remember what we spoke about 10 minutes ago and made a pulling down motion with her hands. He went to do it but I stopped him and readjusted myself. I said that I am capable of doing it myself. My skirt can ride up sometimes and I\u2019m aware of this and knowing all my important bits are covered anyways it does not bother me but if she was concerned to just speak to me next time. \n\nMy boyfriend said that made me an asshole and that she was only trying to be respectful. My argument was that I\u2019m an adult and I feel more embarrassed that she talked to him about it rather than me.

If she was your friend she would\u2019ve be just talking to him about it. Like you said she would tell you directly. By telling him she instigated a fight between you too. And really you should\u2019ve called her out on it.  \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me yourself? Why did you to tell my bf? What are you trying to do here? Get him upset and start a fight between us?\u201d < girls like that when getting called out puts her ass on notice of what she\u2019s trying to do. Don\u2019t put your bf in the middle of it. Cuz that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do.", "NTA She\u2019s treating your boyfriend like he\u2019s your keeper and you\u2019re a child or a possession. It\u2019s weird.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" wasn't being respectful at all. She was being weird and shamey about your skirt, and your bf decided to go along with it. I *hate* it when people take it upon themselves to adjust my clothes, like I'm a little child, instead of just talking to me. It feels demeaning.", "NTA soooo many flags on the field here!!!\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nOne. BF needed to tell friend to mind their business \nB.

Your boyfriend is an AH for doing it.\n\nEdit NTA", "NTA\n\n>remember what we spoke about 10 minutes ago and made a pulling down motion with her hands.\n\nThat is so rude and I can't imagine any friend doing something like that or any boyfriend defending those kinds of actions. Very weird that she was telling him what to do and that he listened, about *you* (his partner), no less! If she was trying to be respectful, she wouldn't be talking about you loudly to someone else, especially your boyfriend.\n\nEdited for formatting and emphasis.", "NTA, she is not your friend and she sounds jealous and tries with these passive agressive immature tactics to shame you. Your BF sucks as well, choosing the side of the girl instead of you. Hopefully you wil choose yourself", "NTA\n\nYour friend sucks for not telling you directly that your outfit needs adjusting (also if your important bits of covered why does she even care???) and instead she told your boyfriend. You are right, you are fully capable of managing yourself and your boyfriend should have known and respected that. you\u2019re absolutely not the asshole", "You're NTA. \n\nUnless there was a full moon rising, your friend should have minded her own business. Even if there was, she should have told you directly. Your boyfriend should have told her that.", "NTA. She was trying to police your appearance, and there's nothing respectful about that.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe AH here is your bf.", "NTA and I wouldn't be able to put up with this from anyone, major ick factor from boyfriend and 'friend' - she certainly wasn't being respectful", "NAH. It sounds like your skirt was riding up really high as you walked, and your friend deferred to your boyfriend as the one who was closest to you who should help you with that. (If you had food in your teeth, or toilet paper stuck to your foot, I hope your friends would help you with that too.)\n\nIt's understandable that you felt awkward knowing they were discussing you. If your friend is constantly undermining you with your boyfriend, then she isn't really a good friend. But if this is a one time thing, I would forgive her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
