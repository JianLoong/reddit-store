An acquaintance of mine, \u201cJessica\u201d, who is part of our larger group of friends heard about the upcoming trip and asked to join us. I was reluctant at first, but she kept PUBLICLY insisting on it by saying that visiting this place was one of her childhood dreams, and it put me in a awkward position to say no. \n\nWe then add her to our travel group chat and go over everything that was already decided on our itinerary and how much money we were planning on spending on this trip. She seemed excited about it and didn\u2019t want to change anything. Great.\n\nUnfortunately, things started to go south the moment she arrived here. Jessica bought a different flight from everyone else and would arrive at 3am. I told her that she could either get a taxi to my house or wait at the airport until 10am when I would drive by to pick everyone else. She was not happy with that and was very passive aggressive for the rest of the day.  \n\nShe then started to complain about our itinerary, how everywhere we picked was too expensive and she felt excluded and judged by the people there. We tried to compromise and did a few touristy things with her, but when we started getting ready to go to a beach club yesterday she threw a fit. I reminded her that she knew about all of this before buying tickets and that she wasn\u2019t forced to join us. She could stay home and eat the food my parents kindly stocked for us or walk around the city center.\n\nWhen we come back home I\u2019m flooded with messages from our mutual friends asking why I\u2019m being so mean to poor Jessica. Apparently she took it to social media and created a narrative that she\u2019s a victim and we\u2019re bullies.\n\nI was sick of it, we had a fight where she called me terrible things (I wasn\u2019t a perfect angel either tbf) and it ended with her being kicked out.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673464238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109d16z/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_vacation/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kudos to you.\n\nIt is always best to trust your gut feeling, but after all is said and done, I think you handled this like a champ.", "NTA....From your post, it sounds like you tried to accommodate her.   She really has poor form inviting herself on a trip she couldn't afford.  She should be grateful she had a nice place to stay and that there was food for everyone.  \n\nShe looks like the fool making this a public issue airing the dirty laundry.  I would remain classy and if it really becomes an issue,  recommend a good book on etiquette. \n\nEnjoy the rest of your vacation.", "NTA. But you should\u2019ve trusted your gut and not have invited her in the first place.", "NTA - never travel with people you barely know", "NTA\n\nShe invited  herself on your trip and then acted appalled that it wasn't catered to her needs and wishes.   Make sure all of the friends blowing up your phone due to her posts on the socials know your side of the story.\n\nGood  luck!", "NTA.\n\nI'm going to assume that the argument escalated into her calling you some nasty names, which is frankly unacceptable for a guest to do to her host.\n\nShe was treating your parent's house as if it were a VRBO that happened to be free, and wanting all of YOUR guests to be HER wingmen on HER dream vacation.\n\nIt's not clear if she posted for sympathy, or to have your mutual friends pressure you to do things her way.  If you kicked her out essentially for airing her feelings on Facebook, then you are a bit TA.  If she was using it to bully you into doing her agenda, then she's even more AH.", "NTA. She knew the plan ahead of time, and it's not like everyone has to do everything together.", "Not really enough details. I mean at it's core NTA.

Wasn\u2019t there to actually know if it was unfair to tell her to leave or not. But do agree that she was impossible and didn\u2019t need to be on the trip ruining the fun for everyone else. Plans made, if she didn\u2019t financially plan to be able to afford any, not one person should have changed those plans for one. Been better had you publicly told her no she wasn\u2019t going. As she didn\u2019t mind trying to use that to get her way. Manipulative people need to not be rewarded. At the very least, told her you would discuss it privately with her later.  Your grammar is fine btw.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. If she didn\u2019t want to be kicked out of your house, she shouldn\u2019t have picked a fight with you.", "NTA She invited herself to this trip, gave a fuck about your plans and then played the victim when you don't want to change the plans you had already so long (and she knew) to cater her wishes. She was never a friend. It was the right think to threw her out. She could have had the chance to a nice vacation but some people ruin it for themself.", "Ugh, she sounds like such a Jessica.", "Perhaps you should share this post with those mutual friends. If they want to give you their opinion, it wouldn\u2019t hurt for that opinion to be based on facts.", "NTA - BUT idk if i would necessarily kick her out right away. You need to sit her down, with a witness, and have a come to jesus conversation with her. Tell her she needs to stop causing so many problems otherwise youll have no choice but to ask her to leave.", "Too biased a story to say NTA. It smells ESH with OP being up nosy.", ">we had a fight where she called me terrible things (I wasn\u2019t a perfect angel either tbf) and it ended with her being kicked out.\n\nGoing ESH. Lack of detail on what was said here makes it pretty certain you were both assholes by the end of it.\n\nShe was unappreciative and unpleasant and entitled, sure. You shouldn't have included her on the trip originally: you were reluctant for a reason and you reaped what you sowed here. When she started behaving and complaining as expected, you should have ignored all of it and left her to her own devices for the rest of the trip.\n\n--->Kicking someone out in foreign accommodations should be reserved for serious offenses, not petty squabbles among vacation mates. **Your response to the Judgment Bot says you considered it potentially \"dangerous\" for her** yet you did it anyway.", "INFO: How did your friends that were part of this house, and why didn't they deal with her instead?", "This is a tough one. \n\nThe \u2018potentially dangerous for her\u2019 part makes it tip slightly towards a gentle ESH (but her much more so). She acted really badly and I hope you have the opportunity to provide your perspective to the mutual friends so that they have a better understanding of the situation. It\u2019s not fair that she has put a cloud over a trip that you were looking forward to for such a long time. \n\nBut kicking someone out in a foreign country can lead to so many terrible situations. It would be NTA for me if you\u2019d made sure she was safely able to get home before kicking her out. If something from the \u2018potentially dangerous\u2019 side of things had harmed her, I think you would never forgive yourself. You seem like a kind person and I think it would eat at you if something bad happened. If you\u2019d kicked her out in your home country I would have no problem with it at all.", "[deleted]", "Very soft YTA, only bc of the part where it's on a different country and she might not have enough for hotel.\n\nShe was being entitled and obnoxious so I understand why you kicked her out. Maybe it would have been more considerate if you gave her a warning first about being kicked out.", "NTA.", "Your only mistake here was caving under the pressure of avoiding awkwardness and allowing her come in the first. NTA and feeling awkward by saying \u201cNo\u201d is far less painful then the ordeal you just encountered.", "She invited herself on a vacation & then complained that the itinerary was too expensive for her; I can't fathom getting a flight for 3am arrival, apart from the group, & expecting to have someone, other than a paid service, available for my immediate pickup. She's self absorbed & should have looked into the cost of the excursions/activities to see which ones she could afford before booking her red-eye flight.", "I don\u2019t exactly understand the question, but my other friends agreed with me. I think I was the one who had to deal with her because it\u2019s my house and I took the leadership role on this trip since I\u2019m very used to the place.", "From what I know, she slept in a hotel close to the airport and left the country earlier today. She left my house in a cab that I paid for.", "Sweet. Got to be an ouch that someone pays your fare to get you out of their sight. And as well, a kind act appearance wise too. As you didn\u2019t leave her high and dry. Lord, I think I age myself with some things I say.", "ESH. She sounds like an annoying guest, but by your own admission you weren\u2019t a perfect angel either, so I question what exactly you did because it sounds like you aren\u2019t giving us the full story. I agree with what someone else mentioned - kicking someone out of your house in a foreign country should only be reserved for really serious offenses, and I\u2019m surprised that more people aren\u2019t picking up on this. You don\u2019t kick someone out into the cold in a foreign country, and just for that you are the biggest AH in this scenario. Since you couldn\u2019t say no about her coming, you should just have ignored her silly tantrums. But kicking her out is going too far.", "NTA, just goes to show that generally someone who publicly pressures you into inviting them isn't someone you should ever allow to go along!", " NTA\n\nI hope you\u2019ve learned that you need to say no to things you don\u2019t want to do and people you don\u2019t want to be around. \n\nWho cares if she was publicly posting about wanting to go. She was always going to blast you on social media regardless.", "Looks like you learnt an important lesson, don't be a people pleaser. NTA."]}
