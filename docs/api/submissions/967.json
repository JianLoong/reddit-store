{"id": 967, "submission_id": "ykjh88", "title": "AITA for throwing water at my cousin?", "selftext": "Fake names!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI (F19) went to a family gathering at my auntie's house last weekend. My auntie Frida has a pool in her backyard.\n\nWhen we arrived, my cousin Rowan (F21) warned us she would wear a \"poolside only\" bikini. Hence, nobody could throw water at her. Otherwise, her bikini would become see-through. I don't understand why someone would buy this kind of bikini, but that is Rowan's problem. I also warned everybody that I only wanted to tan this day. Therefore I would lie on a sun chair away from the pool.\n\nLater, while I read a book on the sun chair, Rowan came with a hose behind me and threw water at me. I got infuriated because she crossed my established boundaries and destroyed my book. So I got up, ran after Rowan, grabbed the hose, and threw water at her. Since I was blinded by the rage, I didn't remember that her bikini was poolside only.\n\nThen, Rowan ran back to the house, and I asked my mom to grab my towel. Once I was dry, I changed into my previous clothes and waited alone in the living room, scrolling through Instagram to pass time. Meanwhile, my parents talked with my auntie, since we expected someone would pay for my book (it was an expensive book I cherished very much).\n\nFrida came to talk to me one hour later (she had spoken to Rowan before).  She said Rowan didn't mean to destroy my book. It was all an innocent prank. So if I agreed to apologize to Rowan, she would pay for my book. Her whole point was that I overreacted over a little prank, and I shouldn't have made Rowan flash all the family, including my brother and two male cousins who witnessed the fight.\n\nI don't think I should apologize because:\n\n1. Rowan started the fight.\n2. I forgot that the bikini was see-through.\n3. Rowan didn't apologize.\n4. It's only fair Rowan pays for a valuable item she ruined.\n5. The boys only laughed their heads off for drama Rowan created. They didn't see the \tthing as something sexual.\n\nMy dad and I are threatening to go no contact if they refuse to pay.\n\nHowever, my mom says:\n\n1. She won't cut ties with her sister over a book.\n2. I should apologize (even if Rowan won't) because it's the right thing to do.\n3. I can't tell how much Rowan's humiliation was worth because I didn't experienced it.\n4. If I value the book so much, I should swallow my pride since it is the only way to get the money back.\n\nThe book was part of a six-book collection. It was imported and cost me one month's wage. Besides, my sun chair was ten meters away from the pool. Thus, Rowan's attack was the sole reason the book got ruined.\n\nI\u2019m here to ask for an unbiased judgement: am I the asshole who overreacted?", "created_utc": 1667427344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykjh88/aita_for_throwing_water_at_my_cousin/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you start a water fight, you're volunteering to be doused. She ruined your property, she owes you a replacement. Any \"flashing\" was her fault, since she chose to wear that suit and then start a water fight.", "Hell NO, NTA. Rowan was hypocritical and destroyed something of yours, and you didn't want the prank. Rowan should've followed her OWN wishes and followed it. Your cousin is an idiot and needs to pay for the book, and totally, go no contact.", "NTA. Only an idiot goes to a family gathering at a pool  and wears something designed not to get wet. She also started the water fight so what does she expect?", "Esh. Your mom is right. If this was really about wanting to be paid back for the book you would just apologize and get it over with. Either there is more going on that we aren't privy too or you are immature and petty threatening to go no contact over what really is a stupid prank that you already got revenge for.", "this whole thing is so juvenile, especially since she\u2019s 21 but NTA.  of course some would say be the bigger person and apologize - but she did start it so she should apologize as well. and the book should be compensated for if it was that expensive. \n\nand who the hell buys a bathing suit that can\u2019t get wet, other than maybe the Real Housewives of Wherever?", "NTA all the way. She literally ruined your expensive book. Do not apologize. Your mom and aunt are real enablers, holy moly. And if you and your dad are willing to go NC, I'm wondering if this is just the most recent thing in a long history of bad behavior.", "NTA. \n\nPeople in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. \n\nAlso, what kind of horrendous human wrecks a BOOK? It's not like you were hiding the fact you were reading. It was out in the open. Perhaps not a targeted attack ON THE BOOK but claiming ignorance is BS. \n\nI wouldn't be in a hurry to apologise. It's basically a law that if someone throws water on you, you do it back. Natural consequences of her actions, really. \n\nAnd yeah, you told her no water fights. She said the same. Then she shot first. \n\nWho saw her see through bikini is irrelevant. Any gender can find various folks attractive, and if you have a known creeper in your family then... don't have them at functions. Any decent human isn't going to be copping an eyeful. And again, she knew what she was wearing when she instigated. So that's off the table. \n\nYour mum is TA for not backing you up, honestly, against TA cousin and aunt.", "Nta go with dad", "NTA\n\nRowan was a fool to wear a suit that can't get wet and then splash *anyone* at a family gathering (you didn't give ages for the boys but I am guessing adolescent? Telling adolescents at a pool party that you can't get your suit wet is kinda like leaving a cookie jar open around children and telling them they can't have cookies)\n\nThat she decided to soak you,  when you had situated yourself well away from the  pool & therefore well away from the center of activity AND announced your wish to stay dry then being dramatic that you retaliated is absurd. \n\n\n\nI hope you can replace your book but I do,  as one book lover to another, suggest keeping precious volumes safe and reading paperbacks or inexpensive editions when lots of people are around. \n(I lost an irreplaceable copy of Alice in Wonderland at about your age because a pack of kids next door were having a water balloon fight and one got lobbed over the fence, I do sympathize with your being upset about the book)", "NTA.\n\nRowan crossed your established boundaries and then DID NOT APOLOGIZE when you crossed hers?\n\nNo way. She also destroyed your property.\n\nF-ck around and find out", "NTA\nRowan fucked around and found out.", "NTA but how much is the book worth to you? Is it worth being railroaded into an apology for it? Is it worth a massive rift in your family because your parents will be on opposite sides in the argument?\n\nI don't think you would be in the wrong for refusing to apologise and I don't think you overreacted, but it looks like you're the only one who can choose how this is going to play out so think carefully and do what you think is best.", "NTA \n\nRowan expected to just destroy a book and soak you and to stand their at laugh at you with no repercussions.\n\nPlay silly games win silly prizes.\n\nOf course Aunty or rowan should be paying for book.", "Who buys a see through when wet bathing suit and wears it to a pool party where it'll surely get wet? Who takes a book worth a month's wages to a pool party where it can get wet? ESH. You should all apologize and grow up.", "YTA what if he was allergic?", "Your mom is wrong about point 4, you can also go to small claims court to get the money back since \n\n>imported and cost me one month's wage\n\nsounds like it probably meets the minimum dollar requirement to be heard there. \n\nObviously you really don't want to go this route if at all possible, but you certainly COULD get the money back even if they don't want to pay without you apologizing. \n\nAlso, if you did LITERALLY the same thing Rowan did, splash water on the other person, AFTER they started it, and DIDN'T permanently ruin expensive property... why would you have to apologize but they don't?", "NTA\n\nIf you hose someone, you should expect to get hosed back.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nShe was the one to hose you, what did she expect? You to laugh it off and do nothing? If you start a water fight, expect to get wet yourself. And who would wear a bathing suit that gets see through at a family pool party?? That's poor planning on her part.", "You forgot she didn't receive an apology, and lost her book. So it's not like they are even.", "Someone who's mom is rich and has a lot of money to spare. I am certain this girl is spoiled.", "Thanks. However, I don't have proofs, so police and law won't help me.\n\nThey only complained about the boys, although there were girls present as well. Everyone had stared at us democratically.", "Thanks. I'm sorry about your book, I feel your pain. Unfortunately, we learned our lesson on book-safety the hard way.\n\nAll boys are over 15, and they were very respectful of our boundaries. They only laughed at Rowan. On the other hand, Rowan's sister (16) asked her \"Why did you run? I'm certain [insert boy names here] loved the view!\". She also told me she is making fun of Rowan up to this day.", "Wrong thread bro", "She has a remedy right there for the book situation, she is the one standing in the way of it by being too petty and immature to apologize. Paying for the book would be what her cousin does in place of an apology. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and apologize even if you aren't sorry.", "i\u2019m sure you are right.  also because she made an announcement not to get her wet, and then she goes and douses somebody else with the hose. The whole thing is stupid", "If you feel like you need police involvement over this sort of thing it's bigger than a book. NC sounds like a great option. Cut your losses.", "Don\u2019t tell me there isn\u2019t a single person out there who\u2019s allergic to chlorine or one of the other dozen chemicals they put in pools, and if not that then to ops piss because I\u2019m like 90% sure she peed in the pool", "Both of them should apologize or none of them. Her cousin must pay for the book no matter what.", "What if I was a allergic to chlorine?", "You're welcome to your opinion and I'm not going to argue with you about it. Have a good rest of your day random internet stranger!", "then you shouldn\u2019t have fallen in the wet poison pit"]}
