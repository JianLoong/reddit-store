{"id": 22618, "submission_id": "153gvwo", "title": "WIBTA if I confronted my sister about how sexual she dresses?", "selftext": "I (17F) have a younger sister (14F) who decided to act grown up really fast and dress very\u2026 promiscuously. Funnily enough it started after she watched Euphoria lol. \n\nFor some context, my sister is very popular and a social butterfly and goes out daily. Her friends happen to be the \u201casshole popular kids\u201d, who are a bad group to be around and put her through a lot of drama and making her very rude and vapid. She learned to do pretty heavy makeup (think \u201cbaddie latina\u201d style) about a year ago, which I have zero issue with, but her clothing choice concerns me.\n\nTo give today\u2019s example, she likes to wear clothes that show a lot of skin. I\u2019m talking those 1\u201d inseam booty shorts, an $80 victorias secret padded pushup bra, and a small tube top to \u201ccover\u201d the bra (doesn\u2019t much lol). She intentionally gives herself a massive cleavage. I\u2019m a little concerned about how much she wants to sexualize herself and how \u201cadult\u201d she wants to seem. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I would never slut shame the outfit if adult was wearing it, but she literally turned 14 only a bit ago and this seems way too excessive. \n\nMy worry comes in the fact that she gets a lot of male attention of people older than her, like boys in my grade. She\u2019s the type of freshman to date a senior. She loves toxic bad boys and doesn\u2019t think getting attention from people 3 years older than her is a big deal, and I\u2019m concerned she\u2019s gonna be taken advantage of. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to describe her style and attitude other than \u201cstreet hooker\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve talked with my mom about it a few times because I\u2019m flabbergasted she doesn\u2019t do anything when my sister\u2019s boobs are literally half out, but she says that she believes in letting \u201cgirls be girls\u201d and not to slut shame. Maybe I still see her too much as a child, but it\u2019s genuinely concerning seeing her get catcalled from guys my age and watching her post suggestive things on social media. She even has a bunch of Indian (grown adult) guys added on snapchat who video call her while beating their meat on cam; she thinks it\u2019s funny. \n\nSo, WIBTA to try and convince her or my mom that this is bad and should be toned down, or just let her go though this phase? My friends agree this is abnormal, but my mom says all girls her age are doing this.\n\nEdit: realized I didn\u2019t clarify this well enough! My main concerns are that she is a kid dressing hypersexually, not that she\u2019s getting sexualized by others and that it\u2019s somehow her fault or anything. People\u2019s reactions are on the backburner of my worries, her sense of self sexualization is the foremost. I fear she takes being sexualized and harassed as a form of self validation to cope with her insecurities that I know she struggles with.", "created_utc": 1689730358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153gvwo/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_sister_about_how_sexual/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only are you NTA, but this sounds like some of this stuff needs to be put on police record to put away those men.", "Nta. Your mom isn't looking out for her. If something bad happens god forbid she is going to blame herself and it's going to create much more of an issue than you telling her its a problem.", "Don't \"confront\", just talk.\n\nNAH", "The most ironic part of how these kids dress is that they try to dress more \u201cadult\u201d but dressing like that is a dead giveaway for being super young. No adult actually wears that\n\nFirst of all, for short term you need to go for a harm reduction approach. She\u2019s going to do what she\u2019s going to do. As sad as it is to say, she needs to be on birth control. Immediately. Do not let this kid get pregnant and fuck up her whole future just because of a few years of experimenting. You should also stress the importance of consent and laws around it (like sex shouldn\u2019t happen while drunk/high, no underage sex, no nudes). But above all, tell her that if something bad happens she can always ALWAYS tell you and you\u2019ll support her. You won\u2019t be mad if she sent someone nudes if she needs help doing damage control, even though you said not to.\n\nSecond of all, I would start de-romantizing older boys. Tell her gross things about the boys your age. Who cares if it\u2019s true or not, does not matter. The \u201creputation\u201d of these boys truly doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re 18 going after a 14 year old. Obviously don\u2019t say they did something illegal/extremely reputation damaging, but if she talks about someone you have to speak her language to turn her off. think of what\u2019s an \u201cick\u201d for her. Let\u2019s say she\u2019s interested in popularity, she says she likes a guy, you respond \u201coh really? that\u2019s funny because nobody likes him in our grade. everyone finds him soooo annoying\u201d or honestly even shit like \u201cew him? I\u2019ve seen him pick his nose in class.\u201d \u201cI heard he kissed like a wet slug and doesn\u2019t brush his tongue so his breath smells awful. nobody in our grade wants to date him, that\u2019s probably why he\u2019s going after girls in your grade.\u201d She thinks he\u2019s a bad boy because he smokes cigarettes? \u201cew he once coughed from smoking so hard he threw up\u201d Just majorly give her the ick about every single guy your age. \n\nThird, therapy. That\u2019s the only way to get to the bottom of this. She\u2019ll probably listen to a therapist that has girl boss vibes, like super pretty, but more importantly super smart and on top of her shit. She needs to see a role model of a real adult, and she\u2019s not going to listen to you or your mom", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that people are telling you that you\u2019re the asshole. Clearly society is going downhill at a faster speed than I was thinking. Good on you for protecting your little sister.

I see a lot of kids similar to your sister, and I feel two things very strongly. \n\n1. People should be allowed to express themselves how they please and dress accordingly \n2. Young people like your sister almost *always* have some troubling stuff going on. Ignoring it under the pretense of point 1 above can have devastating consequences for a young woman\u2019s future. \n\nA conversation based in love, concern, and harsh truths is the right thing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA The world should be safe for young girls to experiment with their clothing and make up but it's not. IDK Y your mom doesn't stop it and watch her a little closer as she's so young. When you talk to her, do it without judging her choices and rather focus on the bad behavior of older male predators. Good luck.", "YWNBTA: I'm super proud of someone your age looking out so diligently for their newly turned 14 year old sister.  She's 14, barely a teenager, not 18.  Your mom also needs to crack down as well.  Nothing good ever comes of a minor looking like she's on her way to college.  She needs to stop attracting the wrong attention as I can tell by your explanation that she's headed down the wrong path.", "NTA, but you\u2019re also not her mother.", "I see how you trying to look out for her and everything but she's not gonna listen especially when it is her older sister. And I know you don't want her to be naive and get hurt or in trouble. It's just stupid that these people who claim to love their kids let them where shit like that out in public and post shit like that.", "Nta.  You are expressing completely valid concerns about your sister and her behaviors especially for someone her age. While the men should know not too behave in such an inappropriate manner she should not be sexualizing herself like this at such a young age, if she were an adult I would leave her be but she is a 14yo and you werent slut shaming her but voicing concern to what should be a adult who could have been trusted to help you. I feel bad that your mom is blatantly ignoring the issue at hand and believe that you should talk to her again and be very explicit in your explanation to her about how this is wrong for a teen too exhibit these tendencies.\n\n      I won't pretend like it's absolutely possible to curb her but I believe that it would be better to try than ignore the situation. If you have too try and go directly too your sister in a gentle way expressing your concern especially about her being taken advantage of by the older teens and men, even if it doesn't work the idea will be re-established in her head and hopefully eventually keep her safe. You are not seeing her too much as a child everybody else is seeing her too much as an adult because even if she is mature she is still a teenager not an adult.\n\n        I know this might not help but I hope it does", "YWNBTA. 14 year olds should not be dressing scantily", "NTA Your mother needs to step tf up and be an actual parent before (God forbid) something happens to your sister!!

I work at a high-school, and they wear crazy things. Literally what I would consider a bra, but as a shirt sometimes. When I went to school, it was just crop tops. Anyways, I'd be a lot more concerned if she were an adult doing this. Right now, she doesn't have a whole reputation or anything. Let her have her phase because she'll get over it, and realize it's immature. I mean, sure you can talk about it with her. I wouldn't confront, or tell her not to outright because  that will ostracized her more. I would just suggest a time and a place. Like, it shouldn't have to be every day. There's no reason for it at the family picnic etc. Most important thing is to maintain a good relationship with you, so that she can come to you in an uncomfortable situation.", "NTA. I have a younger sister too and would be concerned if she dressed and acted this way. The problem is your sister is doing this for attention whether it be good or bad she doesn\u2019t care. That\u2019s not good and a conversation needs to happen to at least make her aware of the dangers. I completely agree men shouldn\u2019t be catcalling or doing any of the shit SOME of them tend to do and I\u2019m not gonna shame your sister, but the world is not a safe place and if she doesn\u2019t have a chat with someone things can go horribly wrong and she can very easily be put in a position she should not be in. Even if the conversation doesn\u2019t stick immediately and she brushes it off, at least something was said and can hopefully help if there\u2019s ever a bad situation that arises. 14 is a hard age but she\u2019s still a kid and shouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to grow up this fast. I\u2019ve seen a lot of young teens online like this and they don\u2019t even realize there\u2019s probably more adults 30-49 years old watching than teens their age. Parents unfortunately don\u2019t always step up. Like your kid is talking to grown men online and is enjoying the interest 17 year olds have in her (not you ofc but classmates and other seniors). Love that you\u2019re out here looking out for your sister when other people aren\u2019t. While it should be your parents, she\u2019s super lucky to have you even if she doesn\u2019t realize it just yet.", "NTA\n\nIt's worth a talk to her... she may not listen... or she does, reacts badly in the moment... but actually takes it all in and modifies her behaviour.\n\nHow to talk to her really depends on what works best for your sister.  It may be coming from the perspective that you're worried about her safety and her being groomed.  Or just a blunt, 'You look like a prostitute.'  And mention that although the boys might think she looks sexy, they think of her as a one night stand and not a long term girlfriend.\n\nReality is that she will be judged by what she wears.  What she thinks is going to be different to what others think.  She hasn't got the emotional maturity to recognise what's happening here.\n\nDon't keep going on about it because she'll want to do the opposite to what you say.\n\nAlso seriously consider talking to her about contraception... I hope your mom has already done this.  She won't want a teenage pregnancy to worry about too.", "It\u2019s literally your mother\u2019s job to parent her children. \n\nI\u2019m shocked that your mother is not punishing this behavior. \n\nIf my barely-teenage daughter used social media to post thirst traps, she would lose her privileges to internet, and get some serious counseling. \n\nIf your mom won\u2019t do her job, do you have some other figure of authority that will try to talk some sense into your mother and sister?\n\nNTA", "NTA but don't tell her. She probably already knows she is oversexualazing herself, theres nothing you can tell her that she hasn't already heard, even if your mom doesn't say anything, believe me, somebody does, and she probably just doesn't care.\nDon't be too worried tho, it's a phase that all women go through, specially at that age. She doesn't realise what that might lead to now, but she will in a couple of years and she will regret it (i say it as a girl who alreayd went through that)", "YWBTA - This is your parent\u2019s problem. Clearly they have decided to allow their daughter to wear what she likes. Accept it and move on. \n\nAlso bizarre that you and your friends seem so obsessed with what she\u2019s wearing.", "YTA her clothes aren't the problem and if you push the clothes, you're going to reinforce the idea that her clothing choices causes predatory behavior. Keep an eye out for predators and report the situation.", "YTA\n\nMaybe you mean well. Maybe you see your sister getting the benefit of attention that you didn't get. It doesn't really matter what your motives are. Any influence you try to exert is baseless. It's not your place to control her behavior.

Instead of shaming her for dressing how she wants, make when you see terrible behavior from men call them out on that.

Parents don't know everything.\n\nSo tell me again how its okay that a 14 year old talking to strange men on the internet and dressing herself up like a character from Degrassi Next Generation. Please, Id love to hear you justify it.\nETA: its also interesting you are able to identify a 17 year old who is legally allowed to work and drive, and nearly allowed to vote as a child but cant identify the child in danger....", "LOL she\u2019s FaceTiming men across the globe letting them jerk off to her. Is this not concerning to you? \ud83e\udd22", "Yeah I think the only result is going to be the sister getting angry at her. Teens don\u2019t want to be parented by another teen. She would be better off talking to her mother again.", "I never said it was okay. I said it was their parents problem and ultimately their decision what rules to put in place. OP has talked to their parent and seems like talked to their sister too. That\u2019s all they can do.\n\nYou seem very emotionally invested for an anonymous Reddit post. Let\u2019s calm down.", "It's very concerning. It's very concerning to me that grown ass men are jerking off to a child. Hence why I advised OP to report weirdos.", "Yeah I am emotionally invested, because when I was 14 I watched my friends begin acting like this and half of them are dead or sex slaves now. Your lack of worry sends alarm bells. You can be calm but I actually hope for the wellbeing of the 14 year old who isn't mature enough to understand the consequences of her actions. You were invested enough to call a worried sibling an asshole, and invested enough to reply to me for telling you you sound sus. But you keep encouraging kids to dress provocatively and tell them parents know everything it'll work out right?", "Obviously it\u2019s disgusting those weirdos are doing that, however are you not going to question why this 14 year old child is continuing to allow this to happen? Clearly her sister needs to intervene", "So, for the third time, I will reiterate that I am not encouraging any behavior of the sister. I am simply saying it is their parent\u2019s place to put the rules in place. \n\nPlease stop projecting \u2764\ufe0f", "She's a child. Children cannot consent. Kids don't understand the full weight of things like this. \n\nYes, she needs help, likely from a mental health professional. But OP is not going about it in the right way. The problem itself is not the clothing. There's something much deeper going on here and even if she did wear more clothing, this is putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. Being okay with this is likely a symptom of something much bigger than the clothing.", "YTA ESH", "Yta. It is okay to be concerned but targeting the clothes is a wrong approach. Ultimately clothes are a form of self expression and you should not try to censor it. You should instead focus on teaching her on how to set boundaries with all these men trying to get with her, teach her the dangers of engaging with older men or engaging in sexual activity at such a young age, and teach her about self respect and self esteem. The clothes are the least important thing and telling her to cover up wont fix anything. You have to get in deeper and address her attitude towards men and sexuality.", "NTA and yes! Choose a good time and be very tactful about how you explain it to her. She might give attitude at first but she also might understand and listen. A suggestion (that my older sister uses on me), take her out for lunch somewhere and have fun, then maybe on the drive home try casually bringing it up. You don\u2019t know how exactly she\u2019ll respond and it might take a few tries, but it\u2019s better than you not saying anything and just letting your sister make questionable choices.", "Your mom won't be saying girl will be girls when she comes home pregnant.", "NTA but myself (in my 40s) grew up around the time of the spice girls and Christina, hot pants, bikini tops and low riders, as all my friends dressed the same. It wasn\u2019t considered problematic. (And looking back it was outrageous for a teen) we were just experimenting and having fun and genuinely were pretty innocent. \n\nIn regards to the male attention, I\u2019ve been cat called walking to the local shop in a messy bun, a trackie and crocs, sadly that will happen regardless.", "Your sister isn't going to listen to you, it will have to be your parents. First send each of them a picture of your sister saying, \"What do you think of this out for a 17 year old?\" When they come back saying it's too promiscuous ask them, \"Why do you allow my little sister to wear it then? She's the model.\" At the next family dinner you need to ask them, \"How much longer before you become grandparents?\" After their initial shock they'll think you're pregnant. Say, \"Not me but since little sister is sending adult men pictures over internet of her on the promiscuous outfits you allow her to wear I give it a year before she's pregnant. Want to bet?\" You need to shake them up and not let them ignore what is happening.", "Unfortunately since your mom doesn't care about the long term damage from potential trauma (it really is risky when she's that young for a guy to give her life time trauma from one \"hangout\" going wrong) there isn't much you can do. I'd just start telling her that you'll always be there for her no matter what happens and that she can always talk to you about anything. That way if anything *has* happened she might slowly open up about it but also if something happened in the future hopefully she'd feel safe with you. You can tell her to be careful and be safe or ask if you mind that you talk to her ab some safety stuff but if she doesn't care then unfortunately there's not much to be done. Thank you for trying to care about this when your mom does not. I am on the same page as you that idc what someone dressed like as an adult but that is because adults have better options of risk management. She's 14 she's not gonna have the experience or options the way an adult might. It's not about her clothes. It's about other teenagers or older ppl being willing to do very disturbing things to her because unfortunately seeing a young person dress that way is a neon sign to creeps that are looking for vulnerable young girls. Basically any young kids they'd assume have problematic lives or rebellious ones that they can take advantage of easier. Maybe if you tell her she might think about it over time.", "NTA. There must be a male figure, even an uncle or grand parent that maybe could help there, possibly. There's a very low chance she is not going to end up on a bad path. I say male figure because usually girls won't listen unless it's someone explaining from the male perspective that it's unacceptable. and even then sometimes.", "Clothes don\u2019t sexualize someone. People have to do that.  \n\nI\u2019d be more concerned that adult people would look at a whole ass child and sexualize them. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what kind of clothing you put on a child, I\u2019m not going to think they\u2019re sexy.", "NTA. There are some bad people out there and she may get taken advantage of. Try talking more sense into your mum and I think the conversation with her should be definitely on the lines of harsh empathy \n\nStill a good chance she might not listen though but worth the shot", "The reason why kids dress more \u201cadult\u201d is because they see it on TV. Like Euphoria, they cast adults well into their 20s/30s to play teenagers and dress them in a sexual manner. Teens see that and think \u201coh that\u2019s how I have to dress to be seen as cool\u201d and will also dress in a sexual manner. Shows that I watched growing up also influenced the way I dressed. I remember wanting to dress like Quinn from Glee, Aria from Pretty Little Liars, Blair from Gossip Girl, and Katherine from The Vampire Diaries. So it doesn\u2019t surprise me that teens nowadays want to dress like Maddie from Euphoria and I absolutely hate seeing it. 12/13/14 year olds shouldn\u2019t be wearing full face of makeup, booty shorts and tiny crop tops and posting thirst traps on TikTok or Instagram. They should be out doing stupid shit like finding an abandoned shopping cart and pushing their friends down the street in it. \n\nYWNBTA OP, you\u2019re looking out for your sister.", "I said yta but not because she is trying to protect her sister but because her approach is wrong. The clothes are a surface level problem. Her sister clearly has some internal issues that need to be dealth with and she should focus on that instead, and be gentle about it. Going straight to the clothes will make her sis feel slut shamed regardless of OPs intention. Girls get harassed regardless of whar they wear so I think OP should go straight to the root of the problem and adress why the sister sees this harassment as a good thing and teach her that this attention from men is actually not a good thing. But they need a deep nuanced talk. Not just her telling sis to cover up.", "Well her mother isn\u2019t doing anything so someone\u2019s gotta", "You said \"maybe you see your sister getting the benefit of attention you didnt get.\" Could you clarify what you mean by this, because I may have wrongfully assumed you are referring to jealousy here.", "And I am reiterating, its supposed to be the parents place to guide their children, but if the parent isnt doing it someone else has to. Its called parents can be extremely shitty. Also who said anything about rules? I think this post is talking about the lack of rules. Boy are you dense. Sorry babe, I think you should tap out. Either you support this behavior or you're one of those parents that would bite someone's head off for telling you your car seat is in wrong. Either way the sister is asking for danger and the mom is too concerned about being a friend than a parent.", "So what\u2019s your solution here\u2026.. The teenager take charge and override mom\u2019s authority? Impose rules since there are none?\n\nWhatever nonsense you come up with it won\u2019t be realistic. \n\nI am sorry that your parents didn\u2019t protect you adequately from whatever trauma is causing you to react so much to this.", "Whats your solution rather than letting a 14 year old let herself get hurt physically and emotionally? Obviously my parents protected me enough, yours im not so sure. \n\nWhat should happen? OP should approach her sister with love and comfort and help her realize men masturbating on a snapchat call to her isn't something that should boost her confidence. Like you know you defending the mom actively defends the mom choosing not to monitor or protect her from online creeps right? Also, OP should tell her concerns to another adult so they can idk step in? Because parents aren't always right and they need to be guided too. Whatever happened to you to make you think this behavior is normal and that the mom doesn't care so nobody should I really hope you fix it. If your solution is to sit back and let whatever happen, happen even if horrible outcomes can be prevented, then please seek help. You can keep posting a million and one replies to justify the lack of a mother figure and the promotion of this behavior though. I think its pretty clear what you are, and it conflicts with my moral compass that says to protect children at all costs. Have a night sweetie \ud83d\ude18"]}
