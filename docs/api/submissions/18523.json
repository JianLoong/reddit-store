Stop there, NTA", "I would definitely donate your Christmas gift budget to charities next Christmas.   Sorry your family are so ungrateful.", "Your family sounds like ungrateful w@nkers.\n\nNot the AH", "NTA Your family are a bunch of ungrateful AH's!  I would cease the gift giving as they don't appreciate the time and thoughtfulness you put into each gift.  The niece and nephew are the only ones I would spend money on.   I would also go LC for awhile", "Stop getting them anything and use the money on yourself! NTA", "NTA. I am the type of person who will return or exchange gifts that are not practical (it\u2019s better than them collecting dust for years). Gift cards are my FAVORITE gift! I feel like you can\u2019t both be the person who is an ahole about unwanted gifts AND the person who doesn\u2019t like gift cards. They stink. I think it was thoughtful of you to read the room and adjust accordingly.", "NTA! It\u2019s harder to buy things for people as they get older because they can just buy everything they need. We\u2019ve been doing a secret Santa for the adults and still giving the kids gifts and gift cards. At least with a gift card they can buy something that they want rather then you wasting your time and money on something that they don\u2019t use/want.", "NTA. I am questioning why they even care if they sell them anywhere.", "NTA. Surprise them next time with nothing at all. I died on this hill myself with my S/O's family 3 years ago. I spent weeks searching for the perfect individualized gifts, perfect wrapping, and a pretty sum of money. We got things like kitchen towels, wool beanie hats, and \"free gifts\" that come with a larger purchase as gifts In return. We haven't attended Christmas dinner since.", "NTA, umm wtf? They literally sold your gifts. And so you gave them money. You literally made it easier for them and cut out the \u201cmiddleman\u201d. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re so upset. I guess maybe they only want cash lol? Can\u2019t really win with these type of people.", "NTA. Why do you spend Christmas with them? They sound exhausting and unappreciative!", "I don't really get why they are cross.  Whatever they sold the gifts for at the garage sale was surely less than the gift card you gave them so they can't really complain about you being cheap. \n\nInfo: what do they get you? \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSounds like you need to make alternate plans for Christmas next year", "Your family sounds like a bunch of r/choosingbeggars  OP NTA", "NTA. Wow your family is rude and entitled..", "NTA. My own family went back to doing a list years ago. This avoids giving a gift that won't be used and it's understood that if you don't like something on the list that a gift card to one of 1/2 dozen stores/websites is totally acceptable so that person can get what they want. Saves everyone from hurt feelings and miscommunications.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been so hurt by this. It\u2019s very ungrateful and a sense of entitlement as well. Good for you for only getting a card. Honestly, that\u2019s more than most people would\u2019ve done after now they behaved.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nBut TBH, I would have given them just a Merry Christmas card, no gift card.", "Especially at a garage sale when you don\u2019t even get it\u2019s full value, they could have returned new items and gotten their full value, they are both greedy and lazy, why bother, I\u2019d suggest no more gifts for grown ups, just get the kids gifts and if they sell the kids gifts might as well, give them cash or gift cards in the future.  I wonder why they even care if they are going to sell them?", "Gift cards are the absolute worst gift anyone can ever get for anyone else.\n\nYou exchange cash, a currency that can be used for literally anything, into a currency that can **at best** be used for anything, **FOR A FUCKING FEE**. \n\nUsually it is a transfer of currency that can be used anywhere into a store specific currency.\n\nBeyond that madness, you have already given the store 100% of the money, whether or not the giftee ever spends it. There are billions of dollars that are wasted on gift cards each year. Billions of dollars of literally free money for these companies.\n\nThey are the dumbest fucking thing ever. Just give people cash.", "The Human Fund. Money for people.", "Yes! I recommend the Heifer Project. You can buy a whole cow or goat, or a flock of ducks - whatever suits your budget and would most annoy them. You can do one big gift from all, or individual animals from each relative. They will get a thank you card from Heifer.", "Just buy it for them in person.", "Bc it\u2019s fake. If you look at the account they are different ages depending on the post", "Yeah, OP is clearly leaving something out.", "They have several posts of varying ages on the same NSFW sub so definitely fake.", "I agree with this and I feel like something is being left out of this post.", ">They are the dumbest fucking thing ever. Just give people cash.\n\nI thought that was the whole point, that in some places and situations it's considered wrong to gift cash. When it comes to gift cards, I'd say that apart from personal and cultural expectations, it also depends on the card itself. Gift card for something like a supermarket would be the worst present IMO, as it only creates a need to shop at a particular store, where the person will probably buy many small things that they were going to buy anyway, meaning absolutely no connection between the giver and the gift Literally a worse type of cash as you said. On the other hand, something like a massage or \\[insert hobby\\] classes gift certificate, is just like concert tickets - a proper gift as long as you are sure the person is interested.", "Exactly my point! People have asked me what store/restaurant I like going to so they can get me a gift card, but I always just say give me cash, I like the option of being able to use it anywhere. However, they always say 'but that's not personal.' That just confuses me, why go out of your way to spend money to limit oneself to one store only?", "I will take whatever gift cards you don\u2019t want", "Lmaoo thank you for telling me that\ud83d\ude2d what on earth do people gain from wasting their time making posts like this??", "My thoughts too. It's incredibly one sided.", "Oh dear.", "It's providing context for what could have happened the year before gift cards.", "I'm not really here to argue with you. I did say she was NTA. I only provided other insights on what else could've been done or in addition to the gift card. Have a great day.", "It\u2019s fake. If you click on the account they have ridiculous stories and are different ages in each one", "Yeah, I imagine that...", "Came to say JUST this. You bought them gifts, and they sold them. They were also jerks when they received them. You decided to get them gift cards so they can get THEIR OWN gifts and they throw a fit because you didn't want to go through that hurt again. You know what, screw these gauche people, they don't deserve a dime spent on them. NTA and man all their parents dropped a ball when it came to teaching frigging etiquette", "100% spend it on yourself.", "I'm not entirely sure you understand the concept of gifts.", "Right? Imagine being so psyched for your heifer international delivery only to open it up and find a swarm of bees.

They describe situations in which several different people are all independently behaving like huge assholes, with one person (always the OP) portrayed as totally and completely blameless. It's just like the \"I found out all my friends are hanging out behind my back\" posts. Situations like this are *incredibly* rare, yet Redditors have convinced themselves that it's actually common and normal for people to behave his way. In reality, the OP almost always either intentionally lying about the facts of the situation, or is completely unaware of how and why they are actually in fault.", "But if op is so bad at giving Gifts - they didn't like them and sold them , great-  the gift card solution is perfect instead of risking buying again the unwanted things . They buy what they want problem solved.", "It's not an argument lol. I know lots of gift givers who aren't great but why get mad when gift cards are given now? In this situation exactly what is the better option than giving a gift card? It's not like OP gave them nothing. It feels like your comment is more projecting than reading the post. They gave money and not gifts because they weren't appreciated. Isn't that the right thing to do?", "Bad bot. This is a comment from u/angry_seagull_69 from hours ago", "A giftcard isn't a personal gift, it's an obligation. I get cash I can buy something from wherever I want, whenever I want and itthe item is still attached to the person who gifted me the money.
