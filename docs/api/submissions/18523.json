And if your family is calling you cheap and selfish, you need new family.", "NTA why do they even care if they didn\u2019t like what they got last year? You just simplified the process of them selling gifts for money", "EDIT: NTA \n\nYou seem not having nailed it with your presents. Selected with great intentions but still useless to them presents. What do they do with thinks not needed? They sell it which makes it even worse as the $100 turn into $25 when in a garage sale. It's a pity but still it is to be accepted, what do you do with presents not needed or useless to you? Rent out storage and keep them for 10 years? \n\nYou are upset because of the effort and great will wasted them, I accept that. But you should also accept that the selection of presents may have been just not on the spot. So giftcards may just be the better option IMHO.\n\nThat was my reasoning for No Arseholes here, but considering a comment from a friendly bartender I changed to NTA as it feels like the behaviour of your family this year is outperforming any reasons for a No Arseholes Here.", "NTA.  There are ways to avoid unwanted gifts, and gift cards are a perfectly reasonable one.  In my family, we have always done other methods - my dad\u2019s side, you make lists of what you want.  My mom\u2019s side, the adults buy toys and such for the kids, but the adults all do a White Elephant (which is like 99% serious gifts with the odd gag gift thrown in there, and people sometimes take home their own gift if it\u2019s clear nobody wants it).  My immediate family, we mostly shop without lists, but if there\u2019s a specific thing someone wants, asking is appreciated (especially by my parents, who tend to be a bit extravagant).", "NTA at all, and next year maybe don't bother spending so much if they're just going to complain anyway.\n\nAlso, I hope this doesn't come off as rude, but nephew doesn't have a t in it.  I just wanted to let you know even though this is just Reddit and spelling truly isn't a big deal.  I just figure some people may want to know.", "NTA. You got them what they shiwed they wanted.", "NTA. Sounds like your previous effort was a waste of time and if they were selling them were more interested in the money. I'm guessing the gift cards were an equal sort of value so they can stfu and get over it.", "Nta they got what deserves", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They\u2019re so rude and inconsiderate to first of all brush your gifts aside on Christmas & then sell them!? You\u2019re too kind to have gotten them anything at all that following Christmas.

Why waste time searching for something thoughtful and sweet when it's just gonna get sold on a week later?

I can't even imagine selling them at a garage sale a week later. That is the height of rudeness. I'd be tempted to give them cash equivalent of garage sale prices or actual things bought at a garage sale tbh.", "NTA and your family is extremely lucky that you buy them gifts. my father never even remembered my birthday, never knew my age, never bought me a present in his whole life (my mother died when i was 10 so it was my father, me and my sister, no other relatives, he isolated us from everyone). let alone at christmas time... christmas was strictly religious and nothing more. your family is incredibly ungrateful.", "They\u2019re the ones who sold the gifts from last year.

Next year, bags of coal all around!", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have even bothered with gifts cards.

Like, what happened between you and your parents, or have they always been so callous to you?", "OK, so who's cheap and selfish?  The person who buys heartfelt personalized gifts or the person who sells the gift at a garage sale the original gift giver attends a couple of weeks later?
