It was poorly made....\n\n\nAnother example was a picture frame that probably cost less than $1 then had the picture of the family.... But the aesthetics didn't blend well with the picture frame of the house. The frame was black and every frame in the house was white.... \n\nSometimes our intention is to give what our heart thinks the other would like without really thinking about what the other really wants...\n\nIt's like giving shoes to someone that doesn't have feet. What are they supposed to do with that. Should they be thankful for getting that gift.

I mean regift it, fine, but at least give it to someone who didn't buy it for you a year earlier. My mother had forgotten I gave it to her. I asked her why she didn't like it. She said she didn't know what it was. I showed her it was a box (she loves porcelain boxes). She was so embarrassed. I told her she could have asked me what it was. She wanted it back. I told her no, she gave it to me and I want to keep it. Petty of me? Maybe.
