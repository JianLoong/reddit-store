My wardrobe consists of over 200 band shirts, black jeans, a trouser chain and big platform boots. I\u2019m also heavily pierced and have stretched ears. I\u2019ve dressed this way for close to 5 years, my family are accepting of it and it\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nA few days ago, it was my niece\u2019s (6f) birthday party - it was a mix of family and school friends being accompanied by parents. My Mum and I got there a little late so most of the people were already there. Including \u2018Annie\u2019 and her daughter \u2018Sara\u2019 (5f). \n\nThe party was being held in the back garden of my brother\u2019s house, so I made my way through the house and to the back. The second that I stepped onto the patio, Sara burst into hysterics when she saw me. I couldn\u2019t hear her fully but I definitely heard \u201cMake her go away\u201d somewhere in there. \n\nMy brother led me and my niece back into the living room so my niece could show me her presents and Sara could calm down. A little while passed and Annie came storming into the house.\n\nShe asked if I could please leave the party as it wasn\u2019t fair that her daughter couldn\u2019t enjoy herself. She said that my appearance was scaring her daughter and that I should\u2019ve thought about what I wore around little children. She kept insisting that I leave and let her stay there. My niece got upset, saying that she wanted me to stay cause I\u2019m her Auntie. My brother agreed and said that if there was a problem, it was her job to take Sara home and not force others to do the work for her.\n\nShe spent 20 minutes packing her stuff, taking the birthday presents back and mumbling expletives whilst giving me the side-eye.\n\nSome of the other parents at the party agreed with Annie but most didn\u2019t care - non of my family nor my SIL\u2019s family took Annie\u2019s side. \n\nI feel bad but I also felt like I tried to alleviate the situation because I was more than happy to stay inside to keep out of Sara\u2019s way. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: A few people mentioned about what my shirt had printed on it. It was a Slipknot shirt but it just had the band\u2019s logo/font on it. No picture of the band on it either. Just that, some jeans and Doc Martens :)", "created_utc": 1681742510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pj43x/aita_for_not_leaving_a_bithday_party_after_i/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This mother wants her shield wrapped in cotton wool in a world in which she will never see anything that is outside of her current realm of experience. \n\nThat will be one insufferable child. And the situation will.never exist. This mother is ruining her daughter's chances of living a fully rounded life with a variety of diverse experiences.", "NTA. Your niece wanted you there and it was her party. If Sara and her mom don't like it, they were welcome to leave, which they did. There was no reason for them to request that you leave and Abbie/Annie should have used that as a learning opportunity instead of pandering to her child. You weren't doing anything scary, just existing.", "NTA \n\nIf I was in her position I would have explained to my child that everyone looks different and gave you the opportunity to show that you\u2019re not as grim and scary as you may appear. It\u2019s not your responsibility to make others feel comfortable when you\u2019re not deliberately trying to make them feel otherwise. You\u2019re just existing. \n\nThe fact that she took the presents away is kinda wild. Your niece is five. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong and in a sense is getting punished and stuff taken from her that was given to her when she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nur NTA for not leaving. You were celebrating with your family. You had every right to be there. The mother was overreacting.", "NTA / it\u2019s super entitled for a person to come to a family event and try to evict family because their child is scared.  I\u2019ve actually seen this same thing (scared small children) happen when there are cultural differences or entertainers present.  Their parents didn\u2019t ask the guest or entertainer to leave - instead they explained to their child what was happening.  Would this mom have asked a monk to leave or a clown?  She doesn\u2019t get to control the world. Additionally, you left the area where Sara was and this woman hunted you down to accost you when you nowhere near her child??  Sorry you had to deal with that insanity. And technically your a child still yourself - so she thinks it\u2019s acceptable to have that conversation with you instead of your mother?  What did she want you to do??  Teleport away?  Insane on so many levels\n\nEdited for clarity", "INFO: Are Abbie and Annie the same person?  Who is this person, and their kid, in relation to you?

I think as parents, we should try to find ways to help our kids be braver, not keep keep them in a isolated bubble. \n\nThe thing that I don't understand is, HOW DO YOU HAVE 200 TSHIRTS?!?!?!? I don't even have 200 articles of clothing. That includes counting individual socks.", "NTA.

Because how you dress is up to you, and is not hurtful to the child.\n\nKids are sponges, and I wonder what kind of rhetoric she\u2019s heard from her mother to get that kind of reaction when every other kid was fine. I used to teach in Asia covered in piercings with my ears stretched, and the only child out of literally hundreds that was upset with my appearance told me that their mum said people with piercings are bad people. Every other kid that age would flat out say \u2018why do you have that?\u2019 or \u2018why do you look weird?\u2019.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s my pessimist nature assuming the worst of this crazy mum, but the only opinion you should need to consider in this scenario is your niece\u2019s and family, who seems perfectly fine with you as you are.", "NTA. Annie is and she should teach her daughter not to be judgmental and superficial.", "NTA. Sometimes people aren\u2019t going to like us. Also, maybe if she didn\u2019t coddle her child like that, she\u2019d understand that different types of people exist in the world. Her moms awful reaction is going to perpetuate the ignorance and needless fear. It\u2019s dumb. That could have been an opportunity to teach her child about the different people that exist in the world. Show her that piercings and dark clothes aren\u2019t scary and that you\u2019re literally just a person. Instead she packed her stuff in a horrible mood and basically reinforced the fear and discomfort that her child will feel every time she meets someone who\u2019s different than her. This is a prime example of how fear and hate is taught and passed down from old head generations. \n\nMy intrusive thought processes would have had me imagining chasing her horrified daughter around just cuz I\u2019m evil and this is obviously not a suggestion, but more like a funny scene in a troll movie or show that plays in my head. Lol", "NTA. That mom should have explained to her kid that people are entitled to dress and look the way they want. If her daughter was scared of you, that mom should have done or said something to take that fear away. She could have chatted with you to get to know you, for instance, or she could have shown her daugther that you and your niece were having a good time (thus showing you are actually a very nice person).\n\nAnd I think it's extremely childish of her to demonstratively take 20 minutes to pack and even more childish to take the presents back. That way she punishes your little niece too and that is really unfair.", "NTA at ALL, if your niece and her dad (your brother) wants you there, then that\u2019s final. That trumps anything other people say in my opinion. Maybe Annie should of taken that opportunity to teach Sara about not judging a book by it\u2019s cover rather than being an asshole about it.

She would feel upset that mommy kicked out her auntie. Nta", "Amazing! So would she tell folks in public to leave if they dressed in a way that scared her strange sheltered child? NTA and poor kid gunna have a rough time of things with that mom.", "WTF??? How does a little girl get the idea that black clothes, piercings and metal tees are scary? Most kids I have EVER known have a tendency to accept people as they are. If Sara had a trauma event, or saw part of a scary movie or video that made her afraid of things, then Sara's mom needs to get the girl into therapy. If Sara's MOM is walking around out in public preaching to her daughter that people who dress like you are evil, demons or some other type of deviant, miscreant, child gnawing, crazy person, SHE needs to therapize herself by stopping the shit-talk around her kid. \n\nAt any rate, NTA UNLESS you were specifically requested to \"tone it down\" for the party and instead ramped it up. \n\nIf Sara has trauma with people's appearance, it's ON HER PARENTS to: obviously, get her into therapy AND to warn people at a gathering Sara is going to attend that she has certain triggers, so please be aware- not to change, just be aware, and if you FEEL like it, tone it down.", "NTA - good on you for staying with yor niece who wanted you there. It was her birthday so she should have final say.", "NTA ... the parent should have taught the child the importance of not putting so much emphasis on external appearances.", "NTA. \"Annie\" had no right to demand you leave YOUR nieces birthday party, especially when your niece wanted you to stay. You didn't mean to scare anybody! It's the mothers job to reach her child that everyone is going to look different and it's ok to be that way.", "NTA\n\nI used to be a nanny and the little girl I took care of had her birthday party on Halloween. As I was planning to go out with friends afterwards and the kids party was a dress up Halloween party, I made a creepy (kind of witchy)  black dress, did my make up pale with dark eyes, sprayed my hair a bit crazy and topped it off with some great vampire fangs. \n\nAll the kids at the party knew me so they were fine but one of the little boys had a brother who was about 3, and while he knew me from school pick up he was too young to understand it was me and not a vampire monster. So, with his mums permission, I crouched down, and showed him how I could take the fangs out and explained to the 3 year old that it was just a costume and he didn\u2019t need to be scared. \n\nHe was fine after than and during the party kept coming up to me to ask me to show him my teeth. \n\nThis is the way to handle when a child is scared. If someone looks different, especially if it is just a day to day thing, like wearing dark clothes, having a piercing (or many) or god forbid, looking different because of race or disability. Explain to your kid why they might look different and that it\u2019s not a scary thing to have piercings or wear dark clothes. Don\u2019t let your kid scream and cry and then demand that person removes themselves because you can\u2019t teach your child that everyone is different and some people don\u2019t look like the cookie cutter version you might be used to. \n\nSo, no.

I wasn\u2019t expecting that after reading so many of these types of posts.", "This is why you from infancy teach children it\u2019s not how people look but how they are inside. People can look scary to kids but be wonderful and caring people. I was traveling alone with my 1 & 3 year old and stopped at service plaza for a break. In behind comes 25 motorcycles and they looked a bit rough, I was trying to be open minded. Miss 3 goes up to this huge guy and tells him she likes his motorcycle and her older brother has one but it\u2019s not as pretty as his motorcycle.  Now I have a bunch of men putting my babies on motorcycles and just trying to talk to them.

The victim of an accident who was left disfigured? A person with a physical abnormality from birth?

She could have left more confident, wiser, and with a badass new buddy. What a shame. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "Info: What was the shirt you were wearing? . I'm a metal head myself. I know we aren't scary people. But band t-shirts can be scary to small children. If I'm going to a friend's house who has a small child, I'm not going to wear a band shirt that might upset them. You aren't a scary person, but your wardrobe might be scary to someone who doesn't know the metal scene.", "I suspect this is going to go against the grain here, but here goes: it's obviously your choice to wear what you want and to get piercings and stretch your ears. It's great that your family is accepting and that you feel comfortable. That being said, it's not unreasonable for a 5 year old to be scared if they're not used to seeing someone alter their body and dress in this way. And there's no question that the mother overreacted. She is the only AH in this situation. But it seems to me that this could have been a teachable moment for everyone involved. After the girl had calmed down, maybe she could have been introduced to you and the two of you could have had a nice conversation. And to get ahead of some of the replies, this isn't the same as coddling a bigot who doesn't like being in the presence of \\[insert minority\\]. First, we're talking about a young child. And second, OP has made an active choice to present in this way to the world.", "20 minutes? It took 20 minutes for someone to leave a party? You are going to have to explain what happened there because a person grabs their purse and walks out.  \n\nAnd then a big conversation, essentially a poll of opinions, was held so you knew everyone's views? \n\nWhat? We need more INFO.", "NTA. Her kid is gonna have to learn that there are tons of people that look different and the world is a diverse place. \n\nI do however think that there is somewhat of a responsibility to dress appropriately for a children's party on your part, though. I'm not saying you have to take out all your piercings and wear a frilly dress, but maybe just be conscious that there are children there and not wear anything too extreme. \n\nThe way the mom went about it is completely uncool, especially at another kid's party. If they stuck around and saw how good you are with your niece, maybe she'd be a little less scared and learn that appearances aren't everything. You can't teach your kid that it's okay to starting crying and screaming the second someone a little different looking walks in. What happens when Sarah meets a little kid with a facial deformity or limb difference? Is she gonna run screaming then too? Because her mom is teaching her that that sort of behavior is okay.", "YTA.  You made a choice to dress and present a certain way.  That can be scary for a child to see someone who is heavily pierced and purposely deformed with a potentially violent or disturbing t-shirt on.  Much like little kids can be scared of Clowns.

I also don\u2019t appreciate being called deformed, we all have different opinions on what is cool and I like having stretched ears. It was a T-shirt and some jeans, I wasn\u2019t in a latex bikini. I am also neurodivergent myself and would\u2019ve happily done whatever was needed if Annie had pulled me to the side and discreetly mentioned it to me.", "Lol. Oh hun. You're exhausting.", "Maybe the child is just non educated to different people ? And being neurodivergent as nothing to do with it, I am and I was never scared of people dressing originally... That's not a reason to tell her to get out. She's doing nothing wrong and they can just be far one from the other. Also it's not to another person to accommodate to you, it's not like she's walking a dog or smth, that's her appearance.", "Or the mom could've told that child that this isn't how the world works and introduced her child and made it not so scary.", "I get that, it was an outside party in the garden and I had offered to stay inside the house a few times but that just wasn\u2019t enough unfortunately", "Or this could have been a teaching moment for the child to learn that not everyone looks or dresses the same but that doesn't mean they're scary and should be removed from spaces. This only shelters the child and teaches them to be prejudice towards others. OP is definitely NTA", "Did you upvote it once ?", "Understood.\n\nAnnie/Abbie just have a stick up their rear end.  It's their job to parent their kids and teach them to be accepting, not making other people cater to them.", "Oh, then NTA. I was picturingsomething like a graphic Cannibal Corpse shirt, something that might be genuinely upsetting. Your shirt was fine,the mom overreacted", "I was going to ask if you were wearing a Cannibal Corpse 'Butchered at Birth\" shirt. lol.", "I'm sure you would've! You sound like a very reasonable person. I'm also not sure the mother would have given you the opportunity to have such a conversation anyway!", "It was a 20 minute tantrum so she could make a fuss and pressurise people to back her that you should be thrown out.\n\nIt didn't take 20 minutes to leave.", "And this is a part of Annie's behavior that should really help assure you that she's the one and only jerk here.\n\nHer trying to force you, a relative of the birthday girl, to leave was bad enough. She's just a guest herself. She had no standing to say \"OP must leave\".\n\nBut to take back the presents that she'd brought for your niece? That was just doubling down on her jerk behavior.\n\nThink about it. Annie took back presents she brought for your niece because your brother refused to kick his own sister out of a party for his daughter over an issue that she (Annie) had with your appearance.\n\nThis is not the behavior of a reasonable person. This was the the behavior of someone who acts in a petty way towards a child who was nothing more than an innocent bystander.\n\nAnd while your appearance may have been the catalyst for the situation, you were also an innocent bystander.\n\nYou are NTA.", "Personally I would not attend a child's birthday party in a super revealing outfit or a shirt with foul language on it. But, to each their own. I agree that it's not going to have any lasting effect on the kid, more out of respect to the parents. If you are going out of your way to dress sexy or wearing swear words I do think that's a bit trashy and kinda weird around kids. If someone was wearing the f word or whatever on their shirt I'd probably ask them to change, if I was the host and it was my kid. Depending on the age. I didn't think what OP wore was inappropriate, I was more so just talking about in the future when picking an outfit and for other people commenting on this thread.", "No one said she should take out her piercings.  That doesn\u2019t help.  If you prefer to ruin a party for a child over being gracious and understanding, you are certainly entitled to feel morally superior for that.", "Also neurodivergent here, and as a kid I found people who dressed 'differently' interesting and 'cool'. It was the people wearing suits/dresses 'normal clothes' that bored me personally. Firstly I think using the kid assuming they are neurodivergent as an excuse is honestly a real insult to us ladies who are actually neurodivergent, and the OP hasn't stated how stretched her earlobes are, and calling it deformed is equally as much of an insult. (Unless this person saying that is actually Annie haha, which would make sense then). From what OP has said about how she dressed she was actually incredibly toned down. Jeans and a band shirt with doc martins would be totally acceptable for a dude so yeah... my wardrobe has corsets and things you'd see Morticia Addams wear (the original black and white series), which I wouldn't wear to a kids party either. The mother of this kid was TA and the OP (at 17) sounds more mature than her. Jeans and a tee with piercings are not making a statement either, its just what she feels comfortable in. OP NTA BTW :)", "I\u2019m referring to the stretched earlobes, that\u2019s what it is called when you form large holes in parts of your body that didn\u2019t have them before.  You are deforming them.  Reforming doesn\u2019t have the same meaning.", "I go by the assumption that the child is socialized as is normal for someone of her age who is in school.  An adverse reaction is most likely due to either a neurodivergent response, or OP, who is heavily pierced and has body modifications, is far outside the normal socialization spectrum for a 6 year old.  An abnormal response says to me that there is a strong imbalance somewhere. OP can look however she wants, and people can react to it how they want to, it\u2019s to be expected.  The girl was not in the wrong.  Regardless, a little kindness and compassion towards a 6 year old should be the norm.", "I think that\u2019s fine if the child is older but she\u2019s 5 years old.", "Funny, when reading your initial comment, Cannibal Corpse was the first graphic that popped in my head. \\\\m/", "Yep. She could have grabbed her stuff and waited outside for her ride rather than making a scene. \n\nAnd what is this detail about her taking back gifts?? I mean, lemme get this straight\u2026.this woman has a hissy fit over your shirt, then takes GIFTS BACK FROM A CHILD, WTF?!", "Luckily Annie wasn't the birthday girl, OP's niece was and she didn't have a problem with OP."]}
