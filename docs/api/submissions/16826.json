Not loving this situation right out the gate.\n\nAnd it was when you were at a vulnerable period in your life.\n\nThen **he** breaks the vase and convinces you it's your fault.\n\nNTA and you need to get the hell out of that relationship.", "Wait, you didn't break the vase, he did. Why are you apologizing for his explosive behavior?  If anything, this is how domestic violence begins. Accusations that the victim is at fault for the abuser's behavior.

He needs to learn to control his anger. You made a mistake and fell asleep. He should have been worried about WTF happened to you that you simply forgot about your dogs (you could have passed out or been hurt or something. Instead, he got so mad at you that he began to express his anger physically and broke something. That's his bad behavior - not yours. He's completely gaslighting you into thinking this is your fault.", "NTA - if the vase was that fragile, it shouldn\u2019t have been in a spot where it could fall. You also didn\u2019t break it, he did by being so forceful with the door that it caused it to fall.", "It doesn't actually sound like you did break the vase, it sounds like he did. I suppose you feel you indirectly caused it because of the hiccup with the dogs causing him to slam the door? Or because it fell on you rather than on the floor, you feel you broke it but that's bogus as surely it would have been as damaged if it had crashed to the floor.\n\nThis feels like a situation in which he is unfairly mad at your mistake, and it was really his actions that broke the heirloom, which made him more mad.", "Uhhhhhh you didn\u2019t break the vase and you should be taking him blaming you for it seriously. Yea you messed up, but HE is the one who did the action that broke it. You should evaluate why the blame was passed to you so aggressively. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You did not break the vase. He did. How he reacted is a huge no. He came in screaming at you (shouldn\u2019t do that), broke the vase and blamed you ( shouldn\u2019t do that either) and then has the audacity to be mad at you. It\u2019s all his fault.", "What exactly do you love about him?", "NTA. According to your story, you didn't break the vase, he did. But, be more responsible with your dogs, this could have ended very badly.", "NTA. He broke the vase, not you.", "NTA. That had to be a pretty forceful slam of the door if the vase hasn't fallen before now. You didn't break that vase, he did. Then he blamed it on you? Don't apologize.

Start a new vase with the old and new flowers.", "NTA - it really sounds like HE broke the vase, not you? Or is something misexplained here?", "NTA, the dogs got out because you didn't double check, that's an accident, it happens. The dogs turned out to be fine, it's a lesson to be more careful next time. You had nothing to do with the vase. It was, again, an accident caused by your husband swinging the door open too hard, another lesson learned. These were two unfortunate events that happened but it's no one's \"fault\" the vase broke. \n\nWhat I find concerning is that instead of making sure you're okay and helping clean up he stormed off and blamed you. Have you been checked for a concussion? The family heirloom is a devastating loss, but nothing is more important that your health and well being. Its bothersome your partner put an object above the health and safety of his partner.", "HE broke the vase\n\nRemind him that HIS actions broke the vase\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nThe 20 year old guy who stared dating a 16 year old is the ahole, not you. \n\nHe broke the vase, not you.

I'm just confused as to why he and you said that you broke the vase. It appears to me that your husband does not know how to emotionally regulate. Because of his unnecessary fit of anger, *HE* broke the vase, not you. I think he is deflecting his action and successfully gaslighted you into thinking you broke the vase.\n\nAlso, he is more concerned with the vase than making sure you're ok.", "NTAHow is this your fault? Is he blaming you for not using your Spidey-reflexes to catch the vase before it broke? Did you put it on the mantle knowing that doors opening make things fall off the mantle? Did you make some weird Rube Goldberg machine that just needed the door to be opened forcefully in order to set off a chain reaction that would destroy the vase?\n\nHonestly, I hope he was just mad at himself because he knows that ***he*** was responsible for breaking the vase. I hope this is the case because otherwise your husband needs professional help. Does he normally blame you for things that are his fault?", "Unless you are truly leaving something big out - NTA, he broke it", "NTA also you met at 16 and 21? Am I reading correctly?", "Nta. Don't apologize for breaking the vase cause you didn't break it. He needs to chill.", "NTA. He broke the vase. The fact that it bounced off you on the way down is immaterial.", "NTA! NTA! NTA! Unless I'm misunderstanding something here, YOU didn't break the vase at all. You forgot to bring the dogs in, which is a fairly normal mistake people make from time to time, and HE broke the vase by throwing a dramatic tantrum. When it fell on you he didn't even seem to care if you were okay or not. He slammed the door open with unnecessary force, no doubt screaming the whole time, and didn't consider there may be consequences to his actions OTHER than just scaring his wife. Well, there were. Even kids know that slamming doors can make things fall off surfaces or the wall. The fact that he reacted so angrily at something so simple, the fact that he didn't care you could have been hurt, the fact that he immediately blamed you for something HE did, the fact that your immediate reaction was to apologize and calm him down (it doesn't sound like this is the first time he's reacted like this) the fact that he expects an apology from YOU and the fact that after all that, he undoubtedly left you to clean up the mess yourself? All of those things combined add up to one extremely red flag.\n\nHe gaslighted you into thinking you broke the vase, when it broke because of HIS action. As people, we can only control our OWN actions. And if he had not acted as HE did, that vase would be 100% intact right now, guaranteed. Gaslighting is a form of abuse.\n\nHe stormed off to make a scene, to try to guilt and manipulate you into not only accepting the blame, but to then beg his forgiveness and do everything you can to 'make it up to him'. He doesn't deserve any of it. Let him stay at the neighbors while you consider if this is something you can live with for the rest of your life, because it's only going to get worse if nothing is done about it. He definitely needs help with his anger at the very least. Please stay safe", "Info:  how does opening the door cause something to break?", "NTA, you didn\u2019t break anything, HE did. And don\u2019t let him gaslight you with the whole \u201cwell, if you didn\u2019t make me mad, it wouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d excuse.

That\u2019s\u2026 not what you do with dogs?", "NTA.\n\nThis post is full of red flags. 16 year old girl and 20 year old man, saved you from traffic and swept you off your feet, anger issues, blaming you for things... \n\nThe way you describe cowering away from him, trying desperately to calm him down, while he breaks his own family heirlooms and yells at you even as they fall onto you was honestly chilling. And now you're saying that you broke the vase? Girl, you're gaslighting *yourself* at this point, he broke the vase with his anger.\n\nThis behavior is not normal or acceptable, and I'm a little worried for your safety. You deserve a relationship where you don't have to fear reprisal for things even if you actually *did* break them, much less if you didn't.", "ESH. Of course he was pissed.

And now he is with them because he feels he is justified? Are these drinking buddies or 1950\u2019s knuckle draggers? Or a chick with a wandering eye? I mean, why keep your dogs while you slept instead of checking on you, to see if you were hurt that they got out? These would be questions I would be asking as a relative / friend/ stranger on the street / concerned Reddit reader", "And since she\u2019s quite short, he\u2019s also probably the one who put it up on the mantel.", "Agreed. He broke the vase and blame shifted.\n\nBUT he did not overreact. The dogs could have gotten run over or hurt in many other ways. Anything could have happened. It's good the neighbors took care of them.", "Because napping isn't only for old people \ud83d\ude10", "lmfao so... babies aren't allowed to nap? toddlers and children can't? wow we should really be telling parents this", "Well, no. It is very relevant because he was originally mad about the dog situation. \n\n> A few hours later my husband comes home yelling at me that the neighbors called and told me I forgot the dogs outside and our neighbors had been keeping an eye on them while I was napping. And when he came in telling me this, he opened the door too hard and made the vase that was on top of a mantel fall, and I'm quite short so the vase fell on me as I was trying to calm him down and apologize. \n\nThe fact is that this argument does, in fact, stem from straight up negligence on OPs part and any respectable pet owner would lose their shit at someone who neglected their pet like that. The fact she didn't even know the dog was missing is ridiculous.", "Yep. The denial is strong with this one.", "Are you the husband? Cuz it really seems like you're the husband.", "BS. Tell me you've never been in an abuser be relationship without telling me...\n\nEven people who are scared for their lives can fight back. Wtf kind of nonsense are you on?", "If they are able to fight back, then they are able to check themselves for injuries after being struck by an object. The comment alleges that the woman was in such fear that she was too scared to even check for injuries. You\u2019re seriously reaching, trying to make someone out to be an abuser because he yelled and slam the door. So, I ask YOU: what in the fuck type of bullshit are you on?", "NTA. HE should apologize for breaking the vase when he over-reacted to your mistake. You didn't break it. Plus, he should apologize for yelling at you. \n\nWhy didn't your neighbour come and tell you that your dogs were loose outside? \n\nSorry, lady, but your husband is abusive and his behaviour will only get worse over time. This kind of man typically choses a naive young woman that he can easily control.", "NTA. This is an abusive relationship. How could it be your fault when it broke because he slammed the door and it fell on you?! And instead of being concerned that you were hurt, he was mad and gaslit you into thinking it was your fault it's broken?! You need to get out of this marriage.", "NTA get your things and get the hell out of there. The abuse is only going to get worse and", "NTA. How often does he blame you for things he does?", "I'm curious why didn't the neighbor go tell her the dogs were loose but instead called him?  I mean that would have been a faster solution to getting the dogs back inside right?", "INFO: Where did YOU slam a door so hard as to knock a vase off the wall?", "I was ready to blame you but he broke the vase. He is the AH. But I am worried about you being that tired. If you are very tired all the time. Get a doctor's appt. The behavior of blaming you and yelling at you and not finding out what happen is I big red flag.", "Run", "Um. *You* didn't break it. He did. He opened the door that made it fall... on you, it sounds like. (Probably not a good place for the vase in the first place.)\n\nHim blaming you for it is a huuuuuge red flag. Please reconsider this relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHe broke the vase and did not make sure you were okay after it fell on you and broke. He sounds like he has anger issues for yelling at you and slamming doors open.\n\nIt is a shame the vase broke but you are more important than a vase. The flowers might have been salvaged.\n\nI'd think about if you are really being treated well in this relationship.", "He did not overreact by being angry. However, going straight to yelling and slamming open doors hard enough to knock stuff over IS overreacting. It's behavior that's meant to cow and intimidate, not address and remedy the situation.", "No; just someone using reason and logic, unlike yourself\u263a\ufe0f"]}
