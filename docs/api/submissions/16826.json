So HE broke the vase because HE overreacted to you leaving the dog outside, and then proceeded to berate you for it while you were covered in broken glass and your dogs were barking at you?

Not loving this situation right out the gate.\n\nAnd it was when you were at a vulnerable period in your life.\n\nThen **he** breaks the vase and convinces you it's your fault.\n\nNTA and you need to get the hell out of that relationship.", "Wait, you didn't break the vase, he did. Why are you apologizing for his explosive behavior?  If anything, this is how domestic violence begins. Accusations that the victim is at fault for the abuser's behavior.

He needs to learn to control his anger. You made a mistake and fell asleep. He should have been worried about WTF happened to you that you simply forgot about your dogs (you could have passed out or been hurt or something. Instead, he got so mad at you that he began to express his anger physically and broke something. That's his bad behavior - not yours. He's completely gaslighting you into thinking this is your fault.", "NTA - if the vase was that fragile, it shouldn\u2019t have been in a spot where it could fall. You also didn\u2019t break it, he did by being so forceful with the door that it caused it to fall.", "It doesn't actually sound like you did break the vase, it sounds like he did. I suppose you feel you indirectly caused it because of the hiccup with the dogs causing him to slam the door? Or because it fell on you rather than on the floor, you feel you broke it but that's bogus as surely it would have been as damaged if it had crashed to the floor.\n\nThis feels like a situation in which he is unfairly mad at your mistake, and it was really his actions that broke the heirloom, which made him more mad.", "Uhhhhhh you didn\u2019t break the vase and you should be taking him blaming you for it seriously. Yea you messed up, but HE is the one who did the action that broke it. You should evaluate why the blame was passed to you so aggressively. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You did not break the vase. He did. How he reacted is a huge no. He came in screaming at you (shouldn\u2019t do that), broke the vase and blamed you ( shouldn\u2019t do that either) and then has the audacity to be mad at you. It\u2019s all his fault.", "What exactly do you love about him?", "NTA. According to your story, you didn't break the vase, he did. But, be more responsible with your dogs, this could have ended very badly.", "NTA. He broke the vase, not you.", "NTA. That had to be a pretty forceful slam of the door if the vase hasn't fallen before now. You didn't break that vase, he did. Then he blamed it on you? Don't apologize. He sounds like he has anger issues which is a major red flag.", "NTA. It should be that the flowers, no the vase, is important. Start a new vase with the old and new flowers.", "NTA - it really sounds like HE broke the vase, not you? Or is something misexplained here?", "NTA, the dogs got out because you didn't double check, that's an accident, it happens. The dogs turned out to be fine, it's a lesson to be more careful next time. You had nothing to do with the vase. It was, again, an accident caused by your husband swinging the door open too hard, another lesson learned. These were two unfortunate events that happened but it's no one's \"fault\" the vase broke. \n\nWhat I find concerning is that instead of making sure you're okay and helping clean up he stormed off and blamed you. Have you been checked for a concussion? The family heirloom is a devastating loss, but nothing is more important that your health and well being. Its bothersome your partner put an object above the health and safety of his partner.", "HE broke the vase\n\nRemind him that HIS actions broke the vase\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nThe 20 year old guy who stared dating a 16 year old is the ahole, not you. \n\nHe broke the vase, not you.

I'm just confused as to why he and you said that you broke the vase. It appears to me that your husband does not know how to emotionally regulate. Because of his unnecessary fit of anger, *HE* broke the vase, not you. I think he is deflecting his action and successfully gaslighted you into thinking you broke the vase.\n\nAlso, he is more concerned with the vase than making sure you're ok.", "NTAHow is this your fault? Is he blaming you for not using your Spidey-reflexes to catch the vase before it broke? Did you put it on the mantle knowing that doors opening make things fall off the mantle? Did you make some weird Rube Goldberg machine that just needed the door to be opened forcefully in order to set off a chain reaction that would destroy the vase?\n\nHonestly, I hope he was just mad at himself because he knows that ***he*** was responsible for breaking the vase. I hope this is the case because otherwise your husband needs professional help. Does he normally blame you for things that are his fault?", "Unless you are truly leaving something big out - NTA, he broke it", "NTA also you met at 16 and 21? Am I reading correctly?", "Nta. Don't apologize for breaking the vase cause you didn't break it. He needs to chill.", "NTA. He broke the vase. The fact that it bounced off you on the way down is immaterial.", "NTA! NTA! NTA! Unless I'm misunderstanding something here, YOU didn't break the vase at all. You forgot to bring the dogs in, which is a fairly normal mistake people make from time to time, and HE broke the vase by throwing a dramatic tantrum. When it fell on you he didn't even seem to care if you were okay or not. He slammed the door open with unnecessary force, no doubt screaming the whole time, and didn't consider there may be consequences to his actions OTHER than just scaring his wife. Well, there were. Even kids know that slamming doors can make things fall off surfaces or the wall. The fact that he reacted so angrily at something so simple, the fact that he didn't care you could have been hurt, the fact that he immediately blamed you for something HE did, the fact that your immediate reaction was to apologize and calm him down (it doesn't sound like this is the first time he's reacted like this) the fact that he expects an apology from YOU and the fact that after all that, he undoubtedly left you to clean up the mess yourself? All of those things combined add up to one extremely red flag.\n\nHe gaslighted you into thinking you broke the vase, when it broke because of HIS action. As people, we can only control our OWN actions. And if he had not acted as HE did, that vase would be 100% intact right now, guaranteed. Gaslighting is a form of abuse.\n\nHe stormed off to make a scene, to try to guilt and manipulate you into not only accepting the blame, but to then beg his forgiveness and do everything you can to 'make it up to him'. He doesn't deserve any of it. Let him stay at the neighbors while you consider if this is something you can live with for the rest of your life, because it's only going to get worse if nothing is done about it. He definitely needs help with his anger at the very least. Please stay safe", "Info:  how does opening the door cause something to break?", "NTA, you didn\u2019t break anything, HE did. And don\u2019t let him gaslight you with the whole \u201cwell, if you didn\u2019t make me mad, it wouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d excuse.

That\u2019s\u2026 not what you do with dogs?", "NTA.\n\nThis post is full of red flags. 16 year old girl and 20 year old man, saved you from traffic and swept you off your feet, anger issues, blaming you for things... \n\nThe way you describe cowering away from him, trying desperately to calm him down, while he breaks his own family heirlooms and yells at you even as they fall onto you was honestly chilling. And now you're saying that you broke the vase? Girl, you're gaslighting *yourself* at this point, he broke the vase with his anger.\n\nThis behavior is not normal or acceptable, and I'm a little worried for your safety. You deserve a relationship where you don't have to fear reprisal for things even if you actually *did* break them, much less if you didn't.", "ESH. Of course he was pissed.

I fought for only a couple of minutes and then remained frozen for the rest of the episode. Quite a few people have asked, if i didn't really keep fighting and just lay there, how can it be rape?
