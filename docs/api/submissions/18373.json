It's quite the boundary-crossing situation. I think it's clear that your FIL is not respecting the boundaries you've set, particularly when it comes to food made for your baby.\r  \n\r  \nOn one hand, human breast milk is, by nature, food for humans, and it's not inherently gross or weird for adults to consume. There are even some gourmet restaurants that have experimented with it in recipes! But, and this is a big BUT, context and consent matter greatly. You expressly made these foods for your baby using your own body's resources, and you explicitly told your FIL this. His decision to disregard that and eat the muffin anyway, especially after the previous popsicle incident, is strange at best and definitely disrespectful.\r  \n\r  \nEven if your FIL didn't mean any harm and was genuinely just curious about the taste, the way he went about it was inappropriate. It's YOUR breast milk, not his, and he didn't have your permission to consume it. This isn't a casual matter of sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar. It's a direct violation of your personal boundaries.\r  \n\r  \nWhat it boils down to is a serious need for a conversation about respect and personal boundaries. You, your husband, and your FIL need to sit down and have a clear conversation about what is and isn't okay in this situation. You have every right to be upset about this.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's your body, your milk, your rules.\r  \n\r  \n(And just as a side note: vegan or not, that's not the point. This isn't a discussion about dietary restrictions. It's about respect and consent.)\r  \n\r  \nI'm rooting for you, OP. Please keep us updated on how things go. You're not in the wrong here, and I hope your husband can see that too and support you in resolving this issue.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, side shoutout to you for making the extra effort to provide your baby with nutritious food options. It's not an easy task! You're doing an amazing job, and I hope this situation doesn't overshadow that. Keep up the good work, Mom!", "ESH. Your FIL for eating food that was made for your baby, and you for saying his eating it is disgusting and that he's a pervert for doing it.
