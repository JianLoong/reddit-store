Your husband might not be sensitized to this because it\u2019s normal given the home he was raised in. First time, he thinks he\u2019s funny. After that, creepy. Sad to say that you needed to firmly correct his behavior right off the bat, of course at the very high probability of him turning it around on you.\n\nEach of us - both men and women - should try over time to help their partners grow, including growing out of immature and inappropriate behaviors learned in childhood. Good luck working on your husband; he probably has a lot to unlearn.", "NTA. How hard is it to NOT eat boob milk muffins, dude. \n\n>FIL said I'm a dick because I'd made loads and the baby wouldn't miss out.\n\nThis is... not the argument he thinks it is.

NTA", "He's probably being a creep, but your reaction is basically sexualising breast milk when its a form of nutrition.\n\nAt the end of the day this is a boundary and he directly violated it. \n\nNTA", "Hey OP,\r  \n\r  \nI can absolutely understand why you're weirded out by this. It's quite the boundary-crossing situation. I think it's clear that your FIL is not respecting the boundaries you've set, particularly when it comes to food made for your baby.\r  \n\r  \nOn one hand, human breast milk is, by nature, food for humans, and it's not inherently gross or weird for adults to consume. There are even some gourmet restaurants that have experimented with it in recipes! But, and this is a big BUT, context and consent matter greatly. You expressly made these foods for your baby using your own body's resources, and you explicitly told your FIL this. His decision to disregard that and eat the muffin anyway, especially after the previous popsicle incident, is strange at best and definitely disrespectful.\r  \n\r  \nEven if your FIL didn't mean any harm and was genuinely just curious about the taste, the way he went about it was inappropriate. It's YOUR breast milk, not his, and he didn't have your permission to consume it. This isn't a casual matter of sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar. It's a direct violation of your personal boundaries.\r  \n\r  \nWhat it boils down to is a serious need for a conversation about respect and personal boundaries. You, your husband, and your FIL need to sit down and have a clear conversation about what is and isn't okay in this situation. You have every right to be upset about this.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's your body, your milk, your rules.\r  \n\r  \n(And just as a side note: vegan or not, that's not the point. This isn't a discussion about dietary restrictions. It's about respect and consent.)\r  \n\r  \nI'm rooting for you, OP. Please keep us updated on how things go. You're not in the wrong here, and I hope your husband can see that too and support you in resolving this issue.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, side shoutout to you for making the extra effort to provide your baby with nutritious food options. It's not an easy task! You're doing an amazing job, and I hope this situation doesn't overshadow that. Keep up the good work, Mom!", "ESH. Your FIL for eating food that was made for your baby, and you for saying his eating it is disgusting and that he's a pervert for doing it. Then again, I've never understood why people think human breast milk is gross when anyone other than a baby consumes it.", "ESH. I do agree it\u2019s really weird but maybe he didn\u2019t see it that way ??? Some men are clueless. I do think calling him a pervert was a little harsh but I would also be weirded out by the situation", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nipples don\u2019t lactate normally unless a child was brought into this world. So it\u2019s FULLY unnatural when other people drink it\u2026.

It was a dick move, but that would have been the case even if they didn't have breast milk in them.\n\nI could have worded what I said better in my initial response, but my point (albeit somewhat tangential to OP's question) was that I don't understand why some people think human breast milk is \"gross\" for anyone but a baby to consume.

They can't have anything but milk (be that formula or breast) until they're 6 months but baby was teething from 18 weeks so the doctor recommended making popsicles to help with the gum swelling.", "For teething.

Cold hard things help a lot so breast milk popsicles are a great idea.", "I think you might be assuming that the popsicles have sugar, which they don\u2019t. You can buy a popsicle mold, fill it with nothing but breast milk, and then have breast milk teething popsicles for your baby. I\u2019ve done it before when my babies were little. Nothing added, just straight frozen breast milk.", "You\u2019re not usually supposed to give popsicles to a baby because they\u2019re made of fruit juice etc and they can\u2019t take the sugar that young. But these are made of breast milk which babies can ingest anyway, so is a pretty good solution for teething", "Frozen Gogurt was a lifesaver for us!
