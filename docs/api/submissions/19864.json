That\u2019s not too much to expect of her.", "NTA. How ungrateful. I completely understand not wanting your baby to have all gender stereotypical things, but Peter Rabbit is timeless, and I think that was thoughtful. Imo you don't have to do anything further.", "ah yes, because her new born baby is gonna be conscious of the clothes he's wearing. NTA. you arent TA because of someone being ungrateful.", "NTA. I'd have reached out, retrieved the gift, and left the party without a word. That kind of shitty attitude should never be rewarded.", "Your friend was rude and inappropriate.  She gets to say this if someone buys a football jersey for her older child whose outfit of choice is a lacy pink dress.  You don't get to say it at a baby shower.\n\nYou shouldn't feel embarrassed; she should.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. That was very rude of her. Also Peter Rabbit is adorable and I would think very gender neutral. I have a baby girl and you better believe she\u2019s wearing pink, blue, purple and everything in between.

Otherwise I\u2019d be pretty pissed if one of my friends said that to me.", "NTA- she sounds like an idiot. Does she REALLY think a newborn is going to look at an outfit and feel pressured to wear it? Lmao. If she didn\u2019t set preferences in the invite or even verbally, that\u2019s on her", "NTA. You were trying to be thoughtful and considerate with your gift. Her reaction was unexpected and ungracious. It's not on you to anticipate such specific preferences. Perhaps reach out, express your surprise, and kindly offer to swap the gift if it's truly a problem.", "NTA.\n\nGifts are just that.  A gift.  She should graciously accept anything.  That being said, you should generally stick to what's been asked for, but it sounds like she didn't communicate anything.  It wouldn't hurt to kindly let her know she made you feel bad for your genuine jester, and give her the gift receipt.  \n\nAlso, always include gift receipts.", "NTA. But your friend was. And being pregnant doesn't make you sound that ungrateful and rude, or at least it didn't me. Let her know she can return the gift if she doesn't like it.", "Honestly I\u2019d worry less about who is the asshole here and talk to your friend about what\u2019s going on- it sounds like she\u2019s been getting pressure about how to raise the baby? Everyone has two cents of opinions to throw at pregnant people/those with newborns, it can be really exhausting. It sounds to me like someone bothered her and she unfairly took it out on you after it triggered her.\n\nNTA, but if you are friends with this person you should talk to them about where that came from both for your friends sake and so you can relay that it wasn\u2019t fair to blast you about it.", "Offer to take that gift back as you have receipts and just say that and then we you do return it use that money to treat yourself to a cocktail or something. \n\nI had my baby 6 months ago, I didn't have a shower but my brother got her a beautiful basket full of goodies. \n\nI won't lie here, one onesie was a questionable green with block letters uncle is just a dad but cooler. Now she absolutely looks like a little boy in it lol but I put it on her and sent a picture saying \"thank you uncle, we love you\" because well manners. \n\nShe was ungrateful. That sounds like a beautiful gift.", "NTA.   Ask her if everything is OK because she seemed out of character at the shower.  Tell her you will stop by to exchange the gift, see her reaction.  Sometimes people act differently under stress.  When my friends were pregnant, they were getting stressed by family on both sides over silly things, she may be going through that.", " NTA I would shelve that stupid comment incase it was pregnancy brain and give her 6 moths postpartum to act like she has sense again.

IF she didn't want specific things, then a simple baby shower gift register would have solved that or communicated better.\n\nYou say you were surprised as she is normally gracious, well be ready for when the baby is born, the entitlement will only grow.\n\nPeter Rabbit is adorable, and very gender-neutral, stuff her, do not offer to return it, and please do not stress about this anymore, because believe me she is not thinking about you.", "NTA - Lol, what, this better be pregnancy hormones because that's a very thoughtful gift. Unless she said \"no blue\" on the invite, she was incredibly rude, and I'm sorry she embarrassed you in front of everyone.", "Nta.  My gifts were primarily gender based.  Pink and dresses for my daughter and obvious boy clothes for my son. I was equally grateful for the inexpensive and over the top gifts.  I was happy my friends celebrated with me.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend, however, is.  No one is obligated to attend a shower or send a gift if they can't. Gifts are given out of love, friendship, and generosity.  The giver spent time, thought, and money in selecting the gift.  For these reasons, gifts should be accepted graciously.  How hard is it to say, \"Thank-you.  That's so thoughtful,\" and then later exchange the items she is not fond of for something more to her taste?  That's how non-assholes handle gifts they don't appreciate.\n\nAnd saying, \"This better not be some clothes or blue...\" was very entitled of her.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to not pressure a child into conforming with gender norms, but this was not an acceptable way of expressing that.  Her words were hurtful, whether she meant them to be or not.  Shame on her.", "NTA\nFriend is rude! So don't dress your son in blue all the time. Does that make blue off the table completely? I'd be shocked, too, if someone I thought was a friend acted so ungraciously. If someone is that particular, they should have a gift registry.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t like the gift she could have just kept her comments to herself and returned it or exchanged it later. Did she give any indication that she felt this way about baby clothes/colors prior to the baby shower?", "NTA\n\nBut your \"friend\" is.\n\nBurn the receipt.", "NTA That was a nice gift.", "Right!! Thank you is so easy to say when accepting a gift.", "That\u2019s what I thought; classic, timeless and that it was a gift that I couldn\u2019t go wrong with. So when I got her reaction I was like umm what?! In fairness she didn\u2019t open it, just made the comment but I also haven\u2019t heard from her all week. I texted her to say thanks for inviting me and got nothing back.", "Don't forget the hard eye contact!", "She didn\u2019t open it, just made that comment and then I changed the subject. I really didn\u2019t want her to open it after she said that because it would have made things more awkward in front of all the other ladies. I\u2019m hoping she doesn\u2019t completely hate it but I\u2019m not sure as I haven\u2019t heard from her all week.", "I think I am still shocked hahha.", "Haha I know. The baby can\u2019t tell you if they like the outfit or not. There was no registry or wish list. Just a nice invite for afternoon tea which turned out to be awkward.", "That's what I was thinking!  How exactly do you pressure a baby to wear anything?  They are not conscious of clothes.  They're just going to spit up, poop, or pee on them anyway.", "I might do that because I haven\u2019t heard from her this week. Sent her a text saying thanks for inviting me and she hasn\u2019t replied (normally she would at least \u2018like\u2019 a message because that\u2019s like her trademark but not this time).", "Ha! True. It could have been hormones, emotions etc. and I am really hoping that it was. But it did sting that\u2019s for sure.", "Don\u2019t give her receipts or offer to return it.

She made a rude presumptuous comment (maybe a joke?). If she didn\u2019t want clothes she should have said so.

Unless she specified no blue or gendered gifts BEFORE the party, she doesn\u2019t get to complain about the FREE STUFF she\u2019s getting.

Peter Rabbit imagery is gender neutral and timeless.", "Peter Rabbit was on all of my stuff for my twins, gender neutral was a way of life then, I have boy/girl twins. Teal, mint and gray were life savers lol definitely cut out the whole \u201cis this his sleeper or her\u2019s\u201d questions lol I would just be like \u201cidk but she wore it last\u201d haha and Chuck Taylor all star sneakers, definitely the best gender neutral shoes. \n\nThey\u2019re almost 6 now and run about the same size in clothes and shoes. They occasionally fight about what is \u201ctheirs\u201d because they still love chucks and I bought about 10 band/graphic t-shirts on sale at target. I\u2019m not getting in the middle of that fight though lol", "NTA-when I had my first child I was a dumb mom who did stupid selfish stuff like this.  I would not hold it against her.  She is probably reading way too many parenting books, blogs, group stuff, and listening to other moms who think they know everything.  I totally was a lot more relaxed and not so stuck up with the second.  Give your friend a little grace.", "so she didnt even open it and u were kind enough to say thanks for inviting me etc and u got no response?  very very rude and bad manners of her.", "Agreed.  Also, don\u2019t take things so personally! She didn\u2019t open the gift and say this is a terrible gift.  She was probably trying to be funny.  I also wouldn\u2019t read into her not responding, that too is not personal.  We all need a little grace sometimes:)", "NTA.\n\nI'm having a baby girl just anytime now and I got a lot of clothes for free and 99% of it are pink. And I hate that. Hate.

Give me strength!", "I'd honestly just return it, and just give some cash and say it's for diapers. Like screw you if you want to act like that, then you're not getting any gifts with effort.", "NTA.\n\nThat is being ungrateful. \n\nThe fact she made this comment just blows my mind.", "NTA. She\u2019s was being an AH but maybe her hormones have taken over her personality for a while if this isn\u2019t what she\u2019s normally like. Let\u2019s hope so!", "I think you\u2019re NTA in this situation but I\u2019m interested to learn people think Peter Rabbit is timeless as I think the stories have aged terribly. My stepmum bought some Peter Rabbit clothes for my son (around 6 month old) and we accepted them but didn\u2019t use them. Lots of Beatrix Potter stories are upsetting and violent. I still think about The Tale of Samuel Whiskers every so often and wonder \u2018what the hell?\u2019 to myself.", "You are NTA. \n\nEntitled mother springs to mind. \nIf it was me I would have personally taken her statement as offensive, picked it up and left the baby shower, since she clearly was ungrateful and didn\u2019t want it anyways. \n\nChances are if you returned it to the shop and got her something else - she would have complained about that too. \n\n(Towards the ungrateful mother)\nIf someone gives you a gift, it\u2019s a freaking luxury and a kind gesture, say thank you, don\u2019t insult them.", "OP how dare you make a newborn wear a Peter Rabbit onsie. This might cause rabbit phobia for the rest of the baby's life. So does baby feel 'pressured' when forced to wear what their mother dresses them in? Because that isn't their personal choice either. As if babies have any awareness of what they are dressed in!\n\nIt seems pregnancy brings out the worst in some women. It was a gift. Not cool.", "NTA I'd have gotten up, taken the present, said nothing and left.", "This is why I don't like the idea of baby showers lol.\n\nThat is disgraceful to act like that for any present.\n\nI get the whole colours have no gender thing but what is she going to do? Ban her child from wearing blue completely?\n\nAlso, Peter rabbit is literally a rabbit that wears blue anyway, so ofc a Peter rabbit themed onsie would be blue anyway.\n\nNTA", "$25 dollar gift card in a $3.99 Hallmark card.\n\nNTA", "It's a baby shower! Of course it's clothes and/or blue!  Baby clothes are the most exciting thing to shop for and basically only come in 3 colours!

She was sending me mood boards of what she wanted to do in the baby\u2019s room a few months ago and they had blue in them!!!!!!!", "I know - I am an evil evil person. \ud83e\udd23", "She didn\u2019t open any of the gifts, she put them all on a present table.", "Aaw damn. But on the plus side your daughter will grow so quickly and then you won\u2019t have to see as much pink. \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, that's what I'm telling myself. I'll buy lots of colorful clothes, when shes grows. \ud83d\ude02", "Spot on.

Thank you.\"\n\nYou won't be the only person to buy her blue clothes - it's kind of the go to item at a baby shower unless you have a closer relationship. \n\nVery rude not to acknowledge your text either. I'd be thinking how this friendship proceeds tbh. NTA", "Unless she had a registry and everyone chose to just buy what they wanted instead of going off of it, I don\u2019t understand her issue. It\u2019s expected that when you reveal the gender, people will be buying gendered items for baby. She needs to adjust expectations", "NTA. \u201cThis better not be _____\u201d upon receipt of a gift is wildly rude except under very specific circumstances. Like if my kid has been playing in mud and comes up and says they have a gift, yeah, I\u2019m probably going to say, \u201cThis better not be a worm or a bug!\u201d", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt just is a ridiculous present and a waste of money.
