That\u2019s not too much to expect of her.", "NTA. How ungrateful. I completely understand not wanting your baby to have all gender stereotypical things, but Peter Rabbit is timeless, and I think that was thoughtful. Imo you don't have to do anything further.", "ah yes, because her new born baby is gonna be conscious of the clothes he's wearing. NTA. you arent TA because of someone being ungrateful.", "NTA. I'd have reached out, retrieved the gift, and left the party without a word. That kind of shitty attitude should never be rewarded.", "Your friend was rude and inappropriate.  She gets to say this if someone buys a football jersey for her older child whose outfit of choice is a lacy pink dress.  You don't get to say it at a baby shower.\n\nYou shouldn't feel embarrassed; she should.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. That was very rude of her. Also Peter Rabbit is adorable and I would think very gender neutral. I have a baby girl and you better believe she\u2019s wearing pink, blue, purple and everything in between. With how often babies soil their clothes my next kid is going to be wearing a lot of her hammy downs regardless of they are a boy or girl \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. lack of communication. \n\ndid she expect you to just.. read her mind? \n\nalong with the fact she deliberately embarrassed you among peers.", "How could you be in the wrong here if you didn\u2019t know her preference?\n\nIt\u2019s a very strange thing to say at that point. \n\nIf she\u2019s a really good friend of yours, you can offer to exchange. Otherwise I\u2019d be pretty pissed if one of my friends said that to me.", "NTA- she sounds like an idiot. Does she REALLY think a newborn is going to look at an outfit and feel pressured to wear it? Lmao. If she didn\u2019t set preferences in the invite or even verbally, that\u2019s on her", "NTA. You were trying to be thoughtful and considerate with your gift. Her reaction was unexpected and ungracious. It's not on you to anticipate such specific preferences. Perhaps reach out, express your surprise, and kindly offer to swap the gift if it's truly a problem.", "NTA.\n\nGifts are just that.  A gift.  She should graciously accept anything.  That being said, you should generally stick to what's been asked for, but it sounds like she didn't communicate anything.  It wouldn't hurt to kindly let her know she made you feel bad for your genuine jester, and give her the gift receipt.  \n\nAlso, always include gift receipts.", "NTA. But your friend was. And being pregnant doesn't make you sound that ungrateful and rude, or at least it didn't me. Let her know she can return the gift if she doesn't like it.", "Honestly I\u2019d worry less about who is the asshole here and talk to your friend about what\u2019s going on- it sounds like she\u2019s been getting pressure about how to raise the baby? Everyone has two cents of opinions to throw at pregnant people/those with newborns, it can be really exhausting. It sounds to me like someone bothered her and she unfairly took it out on you after it triggered her.\n\nNTA, but if you are friends with this person you should talk to them about where that came from both for your friends sake and so you can relay that it wasn\u2019t fair to blast you about it.", "Offer to take that gift back as you have receipts and just say that and then we you do return it use that money to treat yourself to a cocktail or something. \n\nI had my baby 6 months ago, I didn't have a shower but my brother got her a beautiful basket full of goodies. \n\nI won't lie here, one onesie was a questionable green with block letters uncle is just a dad but cooler. Now she absolutely looks like a little boy in it lol but I put it on her and sent a picture saying \"thank you uncle, we love you\" because well manners. \n\nShe was ungrateful. That sounds like a beautiful gift.", "NTA.   Ask her if everything is OK because she seemed out of character at the shower.  Tell her you will stop by to exchange the gift, see her reaction.  Sometimes people act differently under stress.  When my friends were pregnant, they were getting stressed by family on both sides over silly things, she may be going through that.", " NTA I would shelve that stupid comment incase it was pregnancy brain and give her 6 moths postpartum to act like she has sense again. If not, I\u2019m out. Cause your damn baby is gonna wear whatever someone else wants for 5 fucking years, Suzanne!!!!", "NTA - Don\u2019t be bothered by her inappropriate comment. Sounds like she might have been having a bad day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

IF she didn't want specific things, then a simple baby shower gift register would have solved that or communicated better.\n\nYou say you were surprised as she is normally gracious, well be ready for when the baby is born, the entitlement will only grow.\n\nPeter Rabbit is adorable, and very gender-neutral, stuff her, do not offer to return it, and please do not stress about this anymore, because believe me she is not thinking about you.", "NTA - Lol, what, this better be pregnancy hormones because that's a very thoughtful gift. Unless she said \"no blue\" on the invite, she was incredibly rude, and I'm sorry she embarrassed you in front of everyone.", "Nta.  My gifts were primarily gender based.  Pink and dresses for my daughter and obvious boy clothes for my son. I was equally grateful for the inexpensive and over the top gifts.  I was happy my friends celebrated with me.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend, however, is.  No one is obligated to attend a shower or send a gift if they can't. Gifts are given out of love, friendship, and generosity.  The giver spent time, thought, and money in selecting the gift.  For these reasons, gifts should be accepted graciously.  How hard is it to say, \"Thank-you.  That's so thoughtful,\" and then later exchange the items she is not fond of for something more to her taste?  That's how non-assholes handle gifts they don't appreciate.\n\nAnd saying, \"This better not be some clothes or blue...\" was very entitled of her.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to not pressure a child into conforming with gender norms, but this was not an acceptable way of expressing that.  Her words were hurtful, whether she meant them to be or not.  Shame on her.", "NTA\nFriend is rude! So don't dress your son in blue all the time. Does that make blue off the table completely? I'd be shocked, too, if someone I thought was a friend acted so ungraciously. If someone is that particular, they should have a gift registry.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t like the gift she could have just kept her comments to herself and returned it or exchanged it later. Did she give any indication that she felt this way about baby clothes/colors prior to the baby shower?", "NTA\n\nBut your \"friend\" is.\n\nBurn the receipt.", "NTA That was a nice gift.", "Right!! Thank you is so easy to say when accepting a gift.", "That\u2019s what I thought; classic, timeless and that it was a gift that I couldn\u2019t go wrong with. So when I got her reaction I was like umm what?! In fairness she didn\u2019t open it, just made the comment but I also haven\u2019t heard from her all week. I texted her to say thanks for inviting me and got nothing back.", "Don't forget the hard eye contact!", "She didn\u2019t open it, just made that comment and then I changed the subject. I really didn\u2019t want her to open it after she said that because it would have made things more awkward in front of all the other ladies. I\u2019m hoping she doesn\u2019t completely hate it but I\u2019m not sure as I haven\u2019t heard from her all week.", "I think I am still shocked hahha.", "Haha I know. The baby can\u2019t tell you if they like the outfit or not. There was no registry or wish list. Just a nice invite for afternoon tea which turned out to be awkward.", "That's what I was thinking!  How exactly do you pressure a baby to wear anything?  They are not conscious of clothes.  They're just going to spit up, poop, or pee on them anyway.", "I might do that because I haven\u2019t heard from her this week. Sent her a text saying thanks for inviting me and she hasn\u2019t replied (normally she would at least \u2018like\u2019 a message because that\u2019s like her trademark but not this time).", "Ha! True. It could have been hormones, emotions etc. and I am really hoping that it was. But it did sting that\u2019s for sure.", "Don\u2019t give her receipts or offer to return it. Your friend is an entitled and rude person. If she doesn\u2019t have the grace to reply to you, maybe she\u2019s not a friend you need. NTA", "It was awkward bc she was rude and ungrateful and you seem like a nice person. You were so polite to not point out her lack of registry or wish list. Now that I\u2019m old(ish), I would\u2019ve grabbed that gift back, said \u201coops. My bad\u201d and left because I can\u2019t handle disrespect \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Return it, get your money back, and drop the entitled friend.", "Hahahha I wish I had the confidence to do that!!", "It takes practice for sure. But also, I\u2019ve learned over the years that my real friends would never try to make me small. So I tolerate nothing and no one who tries."]}
