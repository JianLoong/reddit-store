If your answers are no, no, no, then you are in no way at fault.  Not in this lifetime or any othe lifetime.  You set a clearly understandable and proper rule that if he wasn't in the car at 7:55 am each morning he would be left to find his own way to school.  He wasn't, he was left behind.  Mom needs to get upset at the right person here and it is not you.  If she is so concerned, then she can wake him up and get him ready.", "NTA. This is a parent fail. And a 17 year old brother fail. Your brother obviously needs to be more responsible for himself. Your mom needs to parent better.\n\nThis is not a you fail.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to deal with him acting like a 5 year old in the mornings. It\u2019s good that you drew that 7:55 line in the sand.

If you drove away at 7:55 while he was standing in the doorway putting his shoes on, you'd be a bit of an asshole. It would be courteous to give him a \"we're leaving in five minutes\" warning - that's what I tend to do with people I'm driving anywhere whether they're my kids, or adult friends, or whoever else. \n\nBut you are not your brother's parent.

I strongly suggest he arrange for a sleep test. Apnea could be at least part of the problem. His \"internal clock\" could also be a bit *off*. ADHD could be involved as well. \n\nI have all three (lucky me!), plus major depression so sometimes you need something like a crane to get me out of bed. I will sleep through alarms, hit snooze without waking up completely (or at all), not even my cats demanding to be fed will get me up.\n\nMine has gotten worse with age. Since he is so young & has so much difficulty, he really needs to get this under control. NOW! So talk to your mom & brother about appointments with a regular doctor, one that specializes in sleep disorders, and a psychiatrist and/or therapist.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA.
