Sounds like he may be like this because Mom lets him get away with it since she gets mad at you for leaving him and not at him  when he doesn't get up and ready on time.", "NTA, don't coddle him, he has to learn now so later in life when he's on his own he can be an adult.", "This is both his fault and your parents. I love how he thinks there will be no repercussions for his missing school.", "It is not your responsibility to get your near-adult brother to school. It is either his responsibility or your parents' responsibility, but it is not your responsibility.\n\nWith that said - there are a lot of possible explanations for the behavior you describe. If it was your mother posting here, I'd tell her to get him to a doctor, have him checked for a physical or mental illness that's making it harder for him to wake up in the mornings or handle his life. This is also not your responsibility to do, but if your mother brings it up again you might see if it helps matters if you say that you're worried that he's sick and should see a doctor.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "So in general NTA, you aren't responsible for his actions. \n\nBut having said that, this was me as a teenager, turns out I have pretty severe narcolepsy and the struggle to get out of bed is REAL. I fully believe you think he's lazy, but I also guess you never know. I was told for years that I wasn't getting enough sleep or I was getting too much sleep or I was an excessively sleepy teenager AND that I was lazy. Just maybe consider that other things are going on. Your parents need to better manage the situation", "He is not your responsibility at 17 he should get himself up for school. Your mom should be mad at him not you. Your not AH", "See, I can see the problem here. But the thing is, is that it\u2019s not YOUR problem. If your brother can\u2019t or won\u2019t get himself to school, that is between him and the parents responsible for him. As a sibling, that ain\u2019t on you my friend. Don\u2019t let them put that on you, you aren\u2019t his mom. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't \"make\" your brother miss a thing - he did that all on him own.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not your problem. \n\nHowever, if this has been going on for years, maybe he is not just lazy. As someone mentioned he could have a sleeping disorder or a number of other conditions. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to find that out though, but if you feel comfortable doing so, you might bring it up to your mum.", "NTA. But also\u2026 your brother doesn\u2019t sound lazy. He sounds like he\u2019s having a significantly hard time that your parents should be checking on. He sounds like I did when I was severely depressed.", "NTA. \n\nWow, your mom and your brother are BOTH putting the responsibility on you for waking him up? I can sympathize with her for being frustrated that your brother is missing so much school, but she needs to be mad at the right person. Good for your for being responsible for yourself.", "If your Mom insists on it being your problem to get him awake and to school, pour a glass of ice water into his ear. That'll wake him up.\n\nDo it earlier every time he isn't up on time.", "NAH.  You are right. But it is harder for people of that age to get up then.", "NTA . Tell your mother to parent her son.", "You dont have to parent your big bro...", "Nta. Your older brother is in control of his actions and it\u2019s not up to you to force him, that\u2019s your parents job.", "Your brother is your mother's problem, not yours. Refuse to accept the responsibility for dealing with his sluggish ass in the morning, because believe me, he doesn't accept that you are responsible for him. \n\nHe does not accept your authority, and mom needs to buy him a bike and tell him to get his own as to school if he can't get in the car on time.", "NTA your brother is a loser. It\u2019s good to set up those boundaries now before you become and adult and get trapped into man sitting him.", "I was like this when I was younger. A bucket of cold water works wonders on people like us.\n\nJust give him a heads up that if he wants to be woken up by you it\u2019s gonna be the bucket treatment.", "I was like this when I was younger. A bucket of cold water works wonders on people like us.\n\nJust give him a heads up that if he wants to be woken up by you it\u2019s gonna be the bucket treatment.", "NTA You are not his parent! You are not responsible for your brother not doing what is expected of him.", "This is called weaponized incompetence. He is purposely doing a bad job so you have to pick up the slack. He also knows that your mother will shame you into helping him, instead of making him responsible for his actions. NTA, but consider the fact that your mother might make life difficult for you (I.e. take away the car as punishment) if you don\u2019t mother him into arriving at school on time. Tread lightly as it is her house. I wish you the best.", "NTA but maybe suggest he have his thyroid checked", "Wake him up. I get it. But he's going to SUFFER if he misses that much school.\n\nLife isn't always about being right.", "What are you supposed to do?  Drag him out of bed, dress him and feed him?  Nta.  He can get his a$$ up or miss school.", "NTA but he should probably see a doctor to screen for mental illness. Maybe he's being lazy but it sounds like something might be wrong. \n\nNone of that is your responsibility though.", "And mom is just letting him do this? ...that might be more understandable if she was already at work and can't get his butt up, but even then I'd expect her to enact consequences for each day missed. Change the internet password, remove his phone ... something to incentivize him to actually get up and go.\n\nNTA", "honestly, you set rules and he didn't follow them, thats kinda on him tbh. nta", "I do have to ask, OP, has your brother been tested for a sleep disorder? Because this does sound a bit like how my mornings went before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. My older sister would drop me off at the bus stop in the morning and she would have to continuously come in to my room to get me moving because I was so tired that even once I was out of bed I was still so tired that I would collapse in a chair and fall back asleep. I eventually got surgery to fix the cause (severely deviated septum), but pre that me moving in the mornings was a struggle because I was always sleep deprived.", "You're 100 per cent right. I think though that it might be worth seeing a doctor about this.", "He managed to get up on time for a while (the first week at least) so it is possible.  I hate getting up early and/or to an alarm. I would LOVE it if I could sleep until I naturally woke up. But I can't because I have a job that requires me to be there (or be online) by 7am, so I do it. \n\nAnd we're not even mentioning that he chooses NOT to get a drivers license and instead expects everyone, including OP, to be his driver.", "> what consequences are when he goes to college or gets a job\n\nHe might not even graduate high school at this rate", "He's 17. He should be in charge.\n\nI think I maybe 7 years old when my parents gave me a wind up alarm clock. After that I was responsible for winding the clock and setting the alarm. My parents never again had to wake me for school.\n\nProblem is that his parents didn't do the same for him when he was 7. If they had, this wouldn't be a problem now.", "Parents, not just mother. Both parents\u2019 responsibility", "Was wondering what happened before as well # can't he just do whatever that was (unless maybe parents were driving him and have now stopped)", "Hmm. Good call.\n\nThen, teen boy. Sleeps in.", "One Boy Scout camping trip a slow riser got an airhorn in his tent. No further problems, just had to threaten airhorn.", "Sure, great. But that\u2019s not at all what she\u2019s asking a verdict for.", "?", "What\u2019s a Snorlax?", "Thank you so much for this comment. I heard this nonsense my entire life starting before I can even remember it.\n\nMy parents and grandparents had heavy expectations of my behavior from a very early age.\n\nWhen I complained that my brother didn\u2019t have any responsibilities or chores (and that never changed btw) I was scolded and told that I was older and that girls mature faster than boys.\n\nFor the record I am older by ten minutes", "Ohhh this. Relentlessly slagged by my grandparents for not keeping the house clean enough after my mum died.\n\nI was 13 with an older brother and dad who should have been more than capable of cleaning up after themselves.", "Interesting that OP, the girl, is responsible for getting her older brother up and to school on time.  Doubtful it would be the same if in reversed.  He\u2019s responsible for himself no one else is", "Guess who will get rhw blame when brother gets held back a year and all his friends are moving on? The sister. OP, keep doing what you're doing. His reality check is coming. Tell your parents if they still want to be waking him up when he is 30, this is the path they are on.", "See, now you are kind because I immediately figured that he was up late at night screaming into his gaming headset at his friends online but that could be because I can hear the guy in the apartment below screaming into his gaming headset at his friends online until all hours of the night. (though to that guy's credit, he gets up for work even earlier than I do so he has managed to figure out a balance that works for him...if only I didn't have to hear the screaming)", "And somehow getting his sister blamed for it, to boot! OP is NTA", "Fair but this seems a little extreme, better safe than sorry!", "How is she the alarm clock?! She\u2019s the DRIVER. It\u2019s not her job to make him wake up or continue to check on him. He\u2019s almost an adult.", "I was thinking the same thing.", "Yeah I had assumed he was being a lazy teenager but good point there may be a medical excuse\nIronically given this example and the gender issues running through the comments sister was worse about this than I am", "Why is this your problem at all? Tell your mother to parent and leave you out of it. It\u2019s not your job. \n\nHow is he missing multiple days and the school isn\u2019t contacting his parents? And he\u2019s not getting punished? WTH?", "What time do your parents leave for work? One of my brothers struggled in the morning so they made sure he was up and dressed before they left for work.", "No, it\u2019s a good call. Always check for a physiological explanation before freaking out and assuming. Bodies are wild.", "Absolutely not. He made his bed and continues to sleep in it. As an almost adult, it\u2019s 100% his responsibility. If he fails and doesn\u2019t graduate, his problem. \n\nIf OP and mom bail him out of this, how is he going to handle getting up for college or a job? \n\nYou\u2019re just excusing his poor behavior in favor of what, meaning like easier for him? Nope."]}
