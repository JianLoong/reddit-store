It was an all you can eat style restaurant with a flat dinner rate.  One of her cousins (40F), C, was there with her stepdaughter (13F), SD, but all they ordered was drinks since they had eaten beforehand.  During the dinner, both C and SD did eat a little off of other people's plates.  C probably only had 2 bites just to try a couple dishes, but SD tried a lot of different things and probably ate the equivalent of half a plate of food.  Personally, I'm ok with someone who didn't order the buffet having a bite to try one thing, but half a plate was excessive.  I'm super avoidant and have massive anxiety with even the slightest confrontation so I didn't say anything, nor did I really care.  The problem came when the server brought the check.  They had seen SD eating food and charged her the dinner rate.  C was not having it (in her defense, I don't think she realized how much SD had eaten) and immediately said she would not be paying that and to get the manager.  Here's where things really escalated.\n\nThe manager (M) comes by and immediately starts arguing with C.  I think M was in the right to want to charge C for the dinner, but they came in hot and did not even try de-escalation.  After a couple minutes of shouting, M says C can either pay for the dinner or M is getting a cop to escort C off the premises and possibly arrest her.  C is very worked up at this point and basically dares M to call the cops.  Well, a cop shows up and tries to de-escalate things (I was actually impressed with how calm he was being) but both C and M are entrenched in their positions and not giving an inch.  This whole ordeal was sending my anxiety through the roof so I leaned over to my wife and offered to pay the $25 myself just to end this thing (only my wife heard the offer since I wanted her opinion before deciding anything).  My wife said that would be just another white man paying to silence a black woman for his own comfort (I'm white while my wife and her family are black).  I thought that was a bit of a harsh response, but I didn't want to raise tensions any more than they already were so I paid for my wife and I's dinners and we left the restaurant.  I thought offering to pay was an ok thing to do, but now I'm not sure.  So reddit, AITA?\n\nP.S.

Wha a stupid sentiment to express.  Nobody likes loud noise and argumentative bullshit, no matter what color the mouth is it emerges from.  You were there to enjoy a meal, not to be party to this kind of noise.  As for your cousin, if someone eats the establishment's food, they have to pay for it.  What is so difficult to understand?  You are NTA", "NTA. What your wife said sounds exactly like what someone would say if their husband was often embarrassed by her family\u2019s behavior in public.", "Wow!

I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not his fault and his wife\u2019s needless addition of race into the mix tells me she knows the behavior is wrong and embarrassing but it\u2019s easier to snap at him than stand up to her family.", "They shouldn't have gone into an all you can eat place then. Apparently they were going to pick a fight from the getgo, and I don't think you were an A to offer but I do think it would have rewarded them for their bad behavior.\n\nHonestly if I was the restaurant owner I'd make them pay and let them just try to eat me out of house and home.

A pretty shitty thing for your wife to say to you though.", "I know I'm not reading these comments right. ya'll are lying out of your ass if you expect me to believe none of you would have argued being charged an extra 25 dollars just cause the tried a couple bites of the family's food. even if ops estimate of half a plate is accurate, at a sit down buffet, that's like 4 bites of food. I wouldn't fucking pay 25 bucks for that either.", "Right?

I don't care. not one single person is gonna convince they would have paid that tab.", "It's because the wife agrees with the cheapskate and views the manager and husband as racist for having boundaries around their bad behavior.", "This was my thought. I'm surprised they didn't charge C as well as usually those AYCE places will charge by person; they don't care that you aren't eating. Then they don't have to monitor who is eating and who isn't.", ">that manager had no business charging them for a full meal\n\nHe literally did, though. Charging people a flat rate regardless of how much they eat is in fact his business model", "I probably would have argued but...the kid seemed to eat a lot more than a couple of bites, if kid was seen eating how would the restaurant/staff know how much they ate reliably. If they followed this business model they would end up losing money with everyone being oh I didn't really eat anything just a bite from xy plate", "This is the only comments here seemingly acknowledging this. People are saying manager is TA, when this is probably the third group to pull the \"just a few bites\" that night"]}
