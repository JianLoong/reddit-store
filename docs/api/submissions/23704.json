Everything was going smoothly, hotel booked. Activities planned. Outfits ordered. And plane tickets purchased. Everything was fine and i was looking foward to spending the holiday with my cousin. \n\nI was at home last week when i got a phone call at 1am. Mind you my phone is on do not disturb, so my cousin decided to call my aunt because I wasn\u2019t answering. My aunt then comes in to my room and wakes me up to tell me my cousin wants to talk to me.\n\nSo i call my cousin and asked her if everything was ok and she tells me she has two mutual friends who heard though the grapevine that we were going to America, and they had asked her if they could come with us and stay at at the bnb we had booked, which my cousin told them i would pay for. \n\nI tell her that I\u2019m really uncomfortable with the idea of these two people that I\u2019ve never met spending 2 weeks in the same house as us. I asked her why she would tell them it was ok without checking with me first since i was paying for half of everything.  She told me there was no problem with them staying with us because there were two spare rooms in the bnb.\n\n I asked her if she knew these people because she had told me they were mutual friends. She said she had met them at clubs through friends over the years, and they had only spoken a few times. \n\nI told her i didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the idea of them staying with us, because i don\u2019t know them and what they are like. She tells me that i dont have to worry about her friends, and that i shouldn\u2019t judge them because i\u2019ve never met them. My response was that if i don\u2019t end up liking them then I\u2019m stuck in the same house with them overseas, for the next 2 weeks. \n\nThe friends of hers now expect to tags along with us to all the activities we had planned months ago, which I originally thought would just be me and my cousin. Ive told her i don\u2019t know if i feel comfortable with them coming. she\u2019s told me its too late because they have already booked their plane tickets and she had already told them that they can stay with us free of charge. \n\nShes told me that if i don\u2019t like the idea of them staying with us, i can get my own place, although i have already payed for half the bnb, which cant be refunded. I want to tell her I\u2019m not going if they are coming, and they would have to find a way to pay the rest of the bnb without me, but i cant get a refund.

If the bnb is in your name, you cannot let these strangers stay with you. You'd be liable for any damage they cause. So, no. Not happening. \n\nI'm so sorry. Your trip with your cousin is gone.

At the very least they should offer to split everything 4 ways, but I get you not wanting strangers in your space. See if you can get someone else to go with you instead of your cousin.
