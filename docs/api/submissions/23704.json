Mind you my phone is on do not disturb, so my cousin decided to call my aunt because I wasn\u2019t answering. My aunt then comes in to my room and wakes me up to tell me my cousin wants to talk to me.\n\nSo i call my cousin and asked her if everything was ok and she tells me she has two mutual friends who heard though the grapevine that we were going to America, and they had asked her if they could come with us and stay at at the bnb we had booked, which my cousin told them i would pay for. \n\nI tell her that I\u2019m really uncomfortable with the idea of these two people that I\u2019ve never met spending 2 weeks in the same house as us. I asked her why she would tell them it was ok without checking with me first since i was paying for half of everything.  She told me there was no problem with them staying with us because there were two spare rooms in the bnb.\n\n I asked her if she knew these people because she had told me they were mutual friends. She said she had met them at clubs through friends over the years, and they had only spoken a few times. \n\nI told her i didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the idea of them staying with us, because i don\u2019t know them and what they are like. She tells me that i dont have to worry about her friends, and that i shouldn\u2019t judge them because i\u2019ve never met them. My response was that if i don\u2019t end up liking them then I\u2019m stuck in the same house with them overseas, for the next 2 weeks. \n\nThe friends of hers now expect to tags along with us to all the activities we had planned months ago, which I originally thought would just be me and my cousin. Ive told her i don\u2019t know if i feel comfortable with them coming. she\u2019s told me its too late because they have already booked their plane tickets and she had already told them that they can stay with us free of charge. \n\nShes told me that if i don\u2019t like the idea of them staying with us, i can get my own place, although i have already payed for half the bnb, which cant be refunded. I want to tell her I\u2019m not going if they are coming, and they would have to find a way to pay the rest of the bnb without me, but i cant get a refund.

And it wouldn't shock me if she is having them pay part of the money to cover her half. \n\nYou might get better advice from r/airbnb . They will at least be more familiar with cancelation fees and stuff.", "NTA- does your cousin know the address of the bnb? Does she have access to the plane tickets? I would cancel her ticket and just go alone to the bnb.", "If you\u2019re paying for the airbnb, you decide who stays there. Like seriously, stand your ground. Hell no.", "NTA and don\u2019t go. It\u2019s an expensive lesson in not trusting your cousin to have your best interests at heart. She told them they could mooch off you. - and didn\u2019t even ask first! You can bet also that she will go off with her friends and leave you for large chunks of time, while having you pay to stay alone like an unwanted kid sister. It will also be cheaper in the long run to eat the cost of your half of the BnB, because I guarantee they would be asking you to pay for other things too, since they think you can afford to pay for them.", "It was 1am. Was your cousin drunk and out with these \u201cfriends\u201d? Were they taking advantage of her inebriation, and therefore you too indirectly?", "NTA don\u2019t go. Lose the money it is not worth the hassle and then go no contact with the cousin.", "NTA. Your cousin is being free and easy with your personal space and your money. She says not to judge people you don\u2019t know? In normal circumstances I would agree but this is completely different.\nCancel and eat the fees. This will not be a vacation for you if you\u2019re not comfortable.", "I mean, yeah , it\u2019s written that it cannot be cancelled but if you contact the owner, often they are able to listen and find a solution.\n\nin any case, usually prices of rbnb vary depending on how many people will stay and you might be in breach of contract if you bring 2 freeloaders.\n\ncancel it, find a new one and have a wonderful solo trip. I can tell you that, as a woman, I prefer to travel alone the vast majority of time rather than bickering with 3 (!) other people about where to eat, at what time do we leave, what train do we take and are you serious, you lost your wallet again?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyup not for me.\n\nNTA", "NTA just tell her no! 1 They need to find their own place to stay. 2 If she doesn\u2019t like that they can find somewhere else to stay and split it 3 ways. That you\u2019ll just pay for the original  yourself. 3 Just cancel your half and they can pay you your money back. 4 And if none of that works you\u2019ll cancel the bnb and your flight and they are on their own. This was a trip for you 2 not 4. Learn the word NO it\u2019s freeing.", "NTA\n\nHard no on them staying with you. They can get their own Airbnb. If you cousin wants to meet up with them, fine, but def no to staying with you.", "NTA. That is so inconsiderate.", "hey OP BNB will get you in trouble and charge extra at the minimum for extra guests so tell your cousin that little nugget of info if shes still so insistent", "NTA does the rental company have another property that\u2019s not as large that you could go by yourself as long as they\u2019re not losing income\u2026", "@OP - Definitely eat the cancellation fee, because people this entitled can't be trusted not to trash the place. If the reservation is in your name, you're responsible for any damage they cause.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. And I'm frustrated just reading this.\n\nOP should go along and just do her own thing. Refuse to hang out with cousin, make hard boundaries in the house about not having to share the space OP paid for and cousin can share her side with her good friends who want to tag along. \n\nI would also just do my own activities and ditch the others. No reason you can't have a great time in a new place by yourself. Guaranteed if you hang out all together, you'd end up paying for more stuff. Screw that noise. I'd take the petty road and just have as much fun as I can.", "This is the way \ud83d\udcaf", "YESSS be like sorry but I am paying for this airbnb and I\u2019m inviting these two people and if you have a problem you can stay home.", "Yep I agree NTA\n\nAlong with all the above info, i also suggest calling her and telling that you are also inviting 2 of your friends. Let's see how she reacts.", "This is a really good idea.", "This is a great idea.  Or maybe they have a smaller place she can transfer her deposit and stay alone.", "That is really good advice. If the breack something it will be her credit card", "By all means, pay for 2 strangers  to accompany you on a vacation. I really hope you're joking.", "Contact AirBnB   They can be flexible if you talk to them directly", "Then she should cancel it if she can, if it\u2019s in her name. If it\u2019s all in her cousins name then she needs to walk away and write it off. Ideally it\u2019d be great if she can still go alone", "Most places allow you to reschedule for free then you can cancel later", "But if these strangers cause damages or refuse to clean up after themselves then that's all on her, right? She is responsible and it would be even more expense.\n\nShe really can't stay at the same house with these people. She can't permit it and it is typically against the rules in AirBnB contracts anyway. \n\nShe needs to tell the AirBnB. Either she keeps the house herself (without her cousin) or she gets out of it and removes her name from this because she doesn't want to be responsible for the damages and deposit/cleaning fee loss from these other people.", "Hey the 1986 Denver Broncos are coming also", "It is an empty room so will cost no more. Girls might be cool and fun.", "Does Airbnb require your to list the # of guests? Like a hotel would?", "Agree, it's better to eat the cost than let others stay in the accommodation you paid for. At least that way, they can't trash the place and have the bill sent to your name.", "More likely they will be entitled and selfish like OP's cousin.", "Not only yes, but r/AirBnB is full of stories of people who get big add on charges for bringing more people than they stated, it's not permitted.  OP - you need to tell your cousin ***NO***, you are not allowed to bring two complete strangers on my vacation, let alone expect me to pay for their lodging.  Just no, and if you insist, I'm canceling the AirBnB and suing you in small claims court for the money I wasted.  NTA.", "So then bringing extra people would violate the agreement both her and the cousin agreed too.  Probably won't convince the cousin though.  I can already hear \"They'll never find out\" coming out of her mouth even knowing there are likely cameras that could catch the infraction."]}
