I don\u2019t want to pry into what he does but I also don\u2019t want to leave him unsupervised because it\u2019s a dangerous world out there. I told him to talk to me whenever anyone he doesn\u2019t know texts him (there are a lot of spam and text calls around here).\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I found out that my brother has been using Discord. He\u2019s well below the minimum age and I told him to quit the app. He can watch YouTube kids and use WhatsApp to contact me and my parents, but that\u2019s about it. He doesn\u2019t listen to me, so I tried to tell my mother because she\u2019s more gentle although she can enforce discipline, unlike my father who\u2019s more like the beat-and-insult type of dude. \n\nYesterday, my mom was at work (she works shifts) and my dad wanted to see what my brother was up to because he heard my brother speak with someone who sounded like an adult. I could see that my brother was frightened and he rebooted the phone. My dad saw it and started yelling at my brother. I told my dad to stop yelling because children are not going to listen and will likely hide even more if you insult instead of listen. He told me I have no idea how it feels like to be a parent. \n\nWhen he stormed out, I told my brother to be careful, and he was still scared. A few hours later, my dad came in and started telling me to supervise my brother\u2019s phone. I told him that\u2019s not my job, because I am not a parent, I have no idea to be one, just like what he told me. It\u2019s not my responsibility to do that, and it\u2019s not only my mom\u2019s. He blames my mom for not supervising enough and for being at work \u201ctoo much\u201d. \n\nI told my dad that he needs to stop stepping in only when it comes to fun stuff. A parent has to be there for their underaged children no matter what happens. I also told him that maybe if you helped mom more she wouldn\u2019t be so overwhelmed taking care of the house and the kids (I have a sister who is 16) and work at the same time. He told me that a man\u2019s job is to provide and be respected and he already provides so that\u2019s enough. I told him that he should stop putting the burden on me and my mom (me specifically) because I am just a sister, it\u2019s not my responsibility, and child nurturing is a job for both father and mother. He\u2019s upset and says that I have no respect for him. AITA?\n\nEDIT: To add context, I am currently attending school on the other side of the world. I text and call my brother but with 15h difference it\u2019s super hard to do that every day, so I do that at least every 2-3 days to check if he\u2019s doing okay at school and if he has problems with his social life. I only go home once every 2 years.\nEDIT 2: My mom works because she wants to. My dad is a liquidator lawyer and makes a lot of money. This is where the entitlement comes from. My mom doesn\u2019t work out of necessity, she\u2019s a doctor and wanted to use her degree.

I told my dad that I am not a parent and I shouldn\u2019t be burdened with the responsibility of supervising my brother.
