So we had to be delayed (!!!!) 20 minutes before she FINALLY stepped aside because the line is now 8-10 people and the cashier (poor kid) doesn't know what to do! \nSome people are totally clueless...", "Yeah I shared all the photos with plenty of guests and he\u2019s in plenty of them. I didn\u2019t crop him out of the entire party. Just the one photo to have of my little family.", "Yes, it\u2019s possible she couldn\u2019t read the room - specifically, she couldn\u2019t read OP.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying all along.\n\nSorry you don\u2019t feel like my personal experience was relevant. If I knew more about what you consider relevant, I would be able to tailor my response to better suit your style.\n\nEdit: Correcting/clarifying autocorrect errors"]}
