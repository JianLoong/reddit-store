But it's time to insert a backbone; as a parent, you're going to need one.", "You need to learn to speak up.", "NTA, but you should have spoken up at the shower more firmly, assertively explaining that you wanted the gift-opening to be a family event, with just you, your son, and your fiance.", "NTA.  This woman has no boundaries.  Next she\u2019ll be inviting her kid to help others open their birthday presents.  This was a family affair and he\u2019s not family.", "NTA, it's you're party and GUESTS need to respect you're wishes.  You wanted to make it a women-only party which is perfectly understandable, and people should not be bringing their boyfriends/husbands and kids along with them, that's just disrespectful! \n\nAnd this mother clearly wants her son to be the centre of attention and take the spotlight away from you.  Assuming you wouldn't mind is rude.  She got what she deserved!  Tell her politely but firmly that you did not have any intention of excluding her son, but her insisting on having him open your presents meant that he was in all of the pictures, when this was supposed to be for you, your fiance and you're son.  If she had simply asked you politely and quietly beforehand if she could have her son opening presents with your son, this could all have been avoided (and you could have had the chance to refuse and if she was unhappy about she could take her son and the hell out of YOUR party!)\n\nAbsolutely NTA, the mother is though!", "NTA \n\nWho tells their kid it\u2019s okay to open someone else\u2019s presents?", "NTA.\n\n\"Well, yes, your son isn't my son, and it wasn't your baby shower and nor was it his baby brother's presents so I'm confused as to where your hurt about me having a photo with my family is coming from.\"", "NTA but for hell's sake, get a spine before the baby comes.  It's not hard to say no.", "Yta for not standing up for yourself at the time.

No kids, husbands, boyfriends or whatever.  \n\nNTA and the lady who told her kid to ask was a real jerk.", "YTA - there were MULTIPLE adults and not a single one could stand up to a child??? this can't be real! only you, and your lack of spine, are to blame for the missing photos.", "NTA \n\nThis is what photoshop is *for* \\- the little kid didn't get his feelings hurt, and you got a photo of a family event that was just you, fiance, and son. Why would it matter to the other mom?", "Absolutely NTA - The other mum is the AH. \nAdvice: Get comfortable with telling people to \u201crespectfully\u201d FO!", "NTA. How rude and entitled, someone should have told her a firm NO at the time", "NTA but use this as a lesson in tactful thinking the next time around. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being polite, but firm. When it\u2019s time for family pictures or opening gifts at gatherings or milestones, asking certain people to \u2018kindly move out of frame\u2019 is a perfectly reasonable request. Its your special time, make it count!", "NTA, you found a way to make a bad situation better, though I ask why you showed her the photos that you adjusted instead of the ones with her son. It would have been easy to pull the few photos you photoshopped.", "NTA. Go to his birthday party and open all his presents. Blow out the candles on the cake even. That will teach him a lesson which his mother clearly failed to do", "NTA . It was your Baby Shower . Entitled Mom has no say what you decide to do with your photos of you and your Family.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your family and friends for inviting others without ask8ng you. I guess not wanting conflict dropped you right in the middle of the mud. You need to toughen up. That said, I'm sorry these fuckers ruined the.occasion for you.", "Shouldve spoken up, but yet NTA. It couldn't have been impossible to ask the kid to step aside for 1 picture.

You had a Clear Vision of the way you wanted it to happen and you were too intimidated-or-what to tell a child \"I'm sorry, this is not for you.\" If this had been your son's birthday, would you have left the other boy open the presents because you were too what-- weak, embarrassed -- to say no. What's so hard about speaking up? Time to start growing a spine.", "YTA So, you didn't tell the boy no and are now upset because he was in the photos?\n\nThe boy's mother even told him to ask your permission which makes me believe if you had told him no, that would have been the end of it.\n\nIt was YOUR place to tell him no, since he specifically asked you.\n\nAlso, a women's only event?
