As she doesn't have a flat here yet, she wanted to live with me for a few weeks or months with her child. I live with my partner in a flat with one bedroom and one living room. So if she moved in, we would be 4 people in the flat.\n\nHere's the problem: I have a very difficult relationship with my sister. She has had a lot of problems since she was a teenager. First and foremost, it's problems with men and money. She is very chaotic and impulsive and lives according to her feelings, not her mind. She often feels victimised by her circumstances and expects others (her family) to help her out. She often asks to herself \"Why is it always me?\".\n\nI, on the other hand, am the complete opposite. I (28f) am younger, calmer, think a lot about my decisions and would never ask someone to do something for me against their will. She is a rather dominant character and I am rather a \"people pleaser\" sometimes. That's why I see living with her as extremely stressful. She is often exhausting for me and robs me of all my energy. That's why I told her I didn't want her to live with me. (I also think that would be against the tenancy agreement).\n\nNow she is angry with me and accuses me of being a bad sister and being cold-hearted. She keeps telling me that.\n\nIs she right? Am I a bad person because I've now drawn a line and I don't want to help her?  \n\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you for your support! Actually, It's been a while since I said \"**no\"** to her. Nevertheless, she still comes back to the subject that I let her down back then. From her point of view, family has no value for me. I'm glad that my partner also said straight away that he didn't want that. But I still had a bad conscience.", "created_utc": 1699883739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ub5di/aita_my_sister_wants_to_live_with_me_but_i_dont/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can stay at AirBNB or something similar while securing a flat.", "NTA. Its your place so its your decision. I have a sister like that, so I dont blame you at all for not wanting to add that kind of stress and chaos into your home.", "Nta\n\n Do not let her walk all over you and convince you that you're being a bad sister. \n\nYou can help her find a place there but I would make sure it's not in the same building or in the same neighborhood as your own", ">\"Why is it always me?\"\n\nI'd be tempted to tell her.\n\nNTA anyway. Even if she were the sweetest person on Earth, there is no room.", "NTA. You live in a small flat that can't accommodate them.  And your partner gets a vote too.  And it is against your tenancy agreement.  You don't even need to get into emotional reasons - you have factual reasons against it.", "NTA  It's not your responsibility to give her a place to live especially when there is no end date. By her yelling and calling you names shows that arrangement would never work. She would bully you and manipulate you. Tell her to go online and look for places to live or she can stay in a hotel until she does. She has other options besides yourself.", "Tell her politely yet firmly the answer is no.", "If it was a weekend, even a long weekend, it might be doable (painful, but doable). But guests, like fish, smell after three days!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Good for you for telling her no. Stay strong. Don't let her guilt trip you.", "NTA. Your place is not her travel hotel.", "NTA. It seems like if you agreed to let her live with you, aside from it being too small of a place, you'd never get rid of her. You and your partner said no, so she has to respect that.", "Thank you. I don't know if it is clear, but with 2-bedroom I actually mean one bedroom and one living room. And of course the rest, kitchen etc.", "Thank you. Well, according to her the small space is no excuse. It's only one bedroom and one living room, but the rooms are big and we have a big couch. She would let me sleep on her couch, so I think she expects me to do the same with her.", "That's right. If it was for a week or a weekend, I had absolutely no problem with it. But for weeks, even months?? That's too much for me. And for my partner.", "Yeah, that would be extremely challenging in the best of circumstances. She\u2019s a grown woman. She can figure something else out.", "That is way worse, I understood 2 bedrooms (so the living room is shared space). Not that your shared space will be where a child and the mom will have to sleep. Definitely NTA.", "So you really don\u2019t have room for her to stay with you since your \u201c2 bedroom\u201d flat is actually 1 bedroom. But even if you had space, your lease doesn\u2019t allow it. You can\u2019t help her. What about other family? Also why can\u2019t she find an apartment now for herself? You can help her by going in person to take a look at a couple if she\u2019s still abroad.", "Doesn't matter what she thinks.  You are stating what YOU can live with.  Plus getting possibly kicked out is not a risk to take."]}
