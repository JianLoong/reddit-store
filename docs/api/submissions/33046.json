Your older brother was being homophobic and also utterly rude to your and your sister's friend Joey. This is not about you being \"sensitive\" - 24yo bro owes an apology to everyone. He started the \"drama\" with his attitude. And who cares if you were gay anyway, ffs?", "NTA. Your brother was the instigator here. As described, you were minding your own business when your brother pronounced judgment on you for having a gay friend. (I assume you did not ask his opinion, and that he just offered it.)  When you defended your friendship, your brother then drew his own bigoted conclusion that you must be gay and also called you a nasty slur.\n\nFor whatever reason, your family seems uncomfortable or unwilling to call your brother on his nasty behavior. So they're counting on *you* to fix things.\n\nSince you have nothing to apologize for, but your brother does, I do not see how you can \"make up\".  Like, does your brother get to stand by his POV and you just have to accept it and say \"bygones\"? Anyway, I doubt your brother truly wants to make up with you, either, so its moot.

If no, then why get upset? Your brother is homophobic, no doubt. Who cares if he asked if you're gay (\"!\")? You're not. That's it. It's not insulting to be called gay, even by someone who meant it as an insult. If the heated part was about the ridiculous 'gay by association' bullshit your brother believes, that's something else.
