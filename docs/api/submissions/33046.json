Your older brother was being homophobic and also utterly rude to your and your sister's friend Joey. This is not about you being \"sensitive\" - 24yo bro owes an apology to everyone. He started the \"drama\" with his attitude. And who cares if you were gay anyway, ffs?", "NTA. Your brother was the instigator here. As described, you were minding your own business when your brother pronounced judgment on you for having a gay friend. (I assume you did not ask his opinion, and that he just offered it.)  When you defended your friendship, your brother then drew his own bigoted conclusion that you must be gay and also called you a nasty slur.\n\nFor whatever reason, your family seems uncomfortable or unwilling to call your brother on his nasty behavior. So they're counting on *you* to fix things.\n\nSince you have nothing to apologize for, but your brother does, I do not see how you can \"make up\".  Like, does your brother get to stand by his POV and you just have to accept it and say \"bygones\"? Anyway, I doubt your brother truly wants to make up with you, either, so its moot.

If no, then why get upset? Your brother is homophobic, no doubt. Who cares if he asked if you're gay (\"!\")? You're not. That's it. It's not insulting to be called gay, even by someone who meant it as an insult. If the heated part was about the ridiculous 'gay by association' bullshit your brother believes, that's something else.

Maybe that distant categorization of Joey stems from the same place your brother's bigoted homophobia comes from.  My sister is 4 years older than me...she called me gay for having lesbian friends.  I am str8 but not narrow.  She was so threatened by something that wasn't even true because of her own small mindedness.  \n\nDoes your brother think you bring shame with this friendship? Why was it cool for your sister?  Does he think gay is catching?  What if you were gay or bi? Would he stop loving you?  Do you care if your siblings are gay or bi?  It is pretty ridiculous, right?\n\nYour family is wrong. They need to encourage your brother to apologize to Joey for his disgusting behavior.  Also, welcome to family with adults...everybody wants to be treated equally but still magically keep their place in the pecking order.", "NTA you aren\u2019t ruining Christmas his behavior and refusal to apologize is the problem", "NTA, but remember this so you can pull his plug when he gets old and sick.", "NTA", "He is the one that should apologize.

People like that need to be publicly shamed so they can hopefully see how dumb and hateful they're being.\n\n  \nBe proud OP, you're just 18 and you're showing to be a mature, progressive and brave man.

Neither of these have any bearing on me.", "Two parts to this: \n\n1. Your brother is an asshole, obviously.\n2. You are an asshole for taking being called gay as an insult. *And I think that is the bigger deal*. Being gay isn't something to be horrified about or hidden. YTA, a massive asshole, on this count.\n\nPoint 2 doesn't make your brother any less of an asshole, it kind of by definition makes him more so. And if your gay mate heard everything and saw that you were upset at being accused of being gay, I think you got some explaining to do, and apologies.", "NTA and that internalised homophobia might be alluding to something he doesn\u2019t like the idea of confronting\u2026 is Joey an attractive male perchance?", "NTA never hangout with shitty people because they are family.

I suggest that a better response would be to say that whether you are or not gay is your business and that if anyone has a problem with it, that is their problem to resolve. NTA", "NTA though I don't think you are upset your brother called you gay. I don't think you care about that because you don't see being gay as a bad thing. \n\nI think you are upset he did it in a derogatory and ignorant way in front of your friend. \n\nPerhaps if your family understood that, they'd stop calling you sensitive. You were not sensitive. You were standing up for someone. If your family cannot respect that you stood up to your friend, that's their problem.", "Just ask him if he's only asking because he's jealous and in love with Joey.", "NTA, but also, getting heated when someone acuses you of something makes it seem like they struck a nerve.

He should apologize and you both should make up.", "I'm gonna go with ESH here. Your brother is a homophobic ass. He deserved to get called out on his behavior. But you took offense to your brother calling you gay. Because your friend heard this happen shows him that you think there is something wrong with him because he is gay. That's where you went wrong. The better response to your brother would have been a \"Whatever dude\" and walk away. I realize you are young and you probably look up to your older brother and you want him to be proud of you.

The better way would be \"I don't care what you think\" and walk away. You escalated and got caught up in it. Try not to do that, learning to deescalate and walk away is a good skill. Not easy sometimes, but helpful. He was being immature, best walk away when that happens.\n\nYour brother is an a\\*\\*, we know that.\n\nYour family are the AH for demanding you just forgive him. He owes you an apology, make sure your family knows your making up is conditional on that.", "Those revisionists here saying that your brother is homophonic is because they are also homosexuals.

He likes cheese sandwiches!", "Finally someone said it. My first thought was ESH because of him just using him. He can't get girls on his own so he has to pretend to like Joey to get one? \n\nAnd the argument getting that big is also a bit insulting to Joey.
