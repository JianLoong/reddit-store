I even offered to do only a week, as I told him that I feel like a week isn't that long for people to wait, it's not like I'm asking him for a month. \nHe told me that I don't have to see people when they come to see the baby, and that there's something sentimental and intimate about people seeing your baby right after it's born. \n\nI understand where he's coming from, but our families are hard for me to be around during just normal days because I just don't have the energy sometimes. I also know that its not really realistic for me to just \"not see them\" if they are visiting, because everyone will be asking about me, wondering where I am, ect.\n\nIATA for thinking it is about me, considering I'm the one that has to carry the baby for 9 months and birth it?\n\nEdit: the topic of unvaccinated family members was not thought about until after the conversation ended.

NTA", "NTA. But if I can offer a suggestion? I had my son at the very beginning of Covid, so this is how my first few weeks went and it was unexpectedly perfect. And sounds like the space you\u2019re wanting: \n\nOnly 2 people in the delivery room was honestly such a blessing for me. We went home from hospital a couple days later and let my parents come meet the baby. Then a few days later, husband\u2019s parents came to meet the baby. Then we locked the house down for at least a month because Covid took off, businesses closed, and we were terrified of exposing our newborn. We actually barely saw our parents the first few months\u2026\n\nBut my point is both sets of our parents got to meet my son as a newborn, after not attending the birth, and then we went to no visitors. They get that special memory, then you get the isolation you want. The bonding and the space to figure out how to be a parent was incredible, so you\u2019re not wrong to want that.", "NTA. Your husband needs to be seriously educated about how traumatizing of a medical event birth is, and how difficult those first two weeks are. Time for him to read the books and get into parenting classes.\n\nDon't have kids with somebody who is going to put his family above you during the time when you are most medically vulnerable. Trust me on this - you do NOT want to have kids with that guy.", "In my culture, it\u2019s norm for the mother & baby to be left alone for 40days after birth. We are also one of the most family-oriented boundaryless cultures in the world. 2 weeks is BARE MINIMUM. A mild fever can be life-threatening for a newborn under 8 weeks. Your baby does not have the immunity you\u2019re not just protecting your own peace but your baby\u2019s health", "NTA. I made people wait a month. And put an order at the hospital for no one to come visit. \n\nFor me, birth is not magical and beautiful. It\u2019s gross and exhausting and I don\u2019t want anyone there. I also didn\u2019t want anyone touching my newborn. I didn\u2019t take her anywhere for a long time.", "NTA NTA NTA. Do NOT have a baby until he understands, and even after that, I probably still wouldn\u2019t. Ask him if he\u2019d like visitors so soon after squeezing a watermelon out of his penis. You don\u2019t even want to know people are visiting together without you, especially not to fawn over baby and probably not even offer to help out around the house. Take it from me, my in-laws were with me for weeks after birth and after 3 days, they knew I felt it was time for them to go. Not because they were doing anything wrong per se\u2019, but just because it\u2019s a sacred time for mommy and baby to bond and figure things out together without an audience.", "NTA It was fairly common for babies to not go outside for several weeks after birth, years ago. TBH, I don\u2019t think it is necessarily a bad thing. Also, it IS about you.  Depending on the type of birth you have, a week surely isn\u2019t a long time constraint.", "NTA! Not at all! Especially with Cold and flu season going on and you are going to be figuring out so much and having so much change in your life! I personally didn\u2019t even have anyone come to the hospital! \n\nWe did surprise our family by driving by after the hospital and showing them a sleeping baby in the carrier to tell them \u201cit\u2019s a boy\u201d but that was it for a while! \n\nI put up a huge list of expectations on FB prior to having baby so people pretty much knew not to bother me and I even went as far as saying if you weren\u2019t flu vaccinated you can\u2019t see baby (this was pre covid!), but it was blanket statements as not to specify certain people. \n\nHowever, be mindful of postpartum depression, and if you feel the need to see someone (a friend or someone!) please ask them to help or give them a call!", "NTA. Your husband should respect your wishes, considering he's not the one who's turning his body over to someone else for nine months.", "NTA at all. I hate how people treat birth like it's just a family milestone. It's a fucking huge medical situation. If your husband had just undergone abdominal surgery, no one would question him wanting a couple weeks to rest. Do not compromise on this.", "This is a second post I've seen today about mothers wanting time to recover. I thought it was a big nono for anybody come and visit for weeks after birth? \n\nAnyway, NTA. Yes, you get the final say, your body build the baby and you risk your life in childbirth and your quality of life will greatly suffer during all of this. Your hubby should be thankful you're even willing to get pregnant or raise children", "NTA \n\nTake time to get to know your baby and establish a routine if that\u2019s what you need. Giving birth is hard work and your body needs rest, which honestly you won\u2019t be getting until your baby gets on a somewhat-predictable schedule (\u201cshe gets fussy at 7 pm, then sleeps for 3 hours after nursing\u2026\u201d kind of thing). \n\nYou said your families are hard for you to be around on normal days because you don\u2019t have the energy. That\u2019s all the reason right there to say NTA. These won\u2019t be normal days, so save your energy for your (hypothetical at this point) baby.", "NTA. And what\u2019s with the men who think childbirth, recovery, and who has access to their newborn doesn\u2019t need to address the mother\u2019s needs \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. The time after birth is literally called the fourth trimester. He somehow thinks you\u2019ll already know the baby well enough after a day or two to know when its non feeding wake windows will be and everyone will for sure be able to come over only during them that way you won\u2019t have to be there? And that you should be willing snd emotionally ready to hand over a days old newborn to people without your supervision and be cool with it? Women who get treated like this during pregnancy and after birth are at higher risk for PPD/A so be careful. Your birth recovery and the baby that just came out of your body are absolutely about you.", "NTA\n\nRead through your comments. I would not let any UNVACCINATED people around a newborn, related or not. This important fact should be in your post and your husband should understand now that the health of his child comes first.", "Two weeks is perfectly reasonable. NTA.", "NTA. Is it possible your husband sees this as him taking care of the housework/cooking for two weeks when he planned for his mother to come over and do that for him?", "NTA and I\u2019m honestly laughing a little at this. Not at you, OP but just at how naive your husband is! I\u2019ve had two kids. Let me tell you I would easily say no visitors for two weeks after birth because 1). Your baby is probably cluster feeding then and basically attached to the boob 2). You\u2019re probably walking around without a bra on because of #1 3). The sore nipples in the beginning from breastfeeding. Holy f*** it hurts so much. I cried every time I had to nurse for a couple of days until we got past that and I always had an easy time feeding (no latching issues, etc) 4). You have to use a bottle to spray after using the toilet because it\u2019s so swollen and irritated. There\u2019s a reason padsicles and giant postpartum pads for all the bleeding are a thing! 5). You\u2019re up CONSTANTLY at night with a baby. Cooking and cleaning to have people over is so not going to happen because you are exhausted. 6). The hormones. Oh the hormones. There\u2019s no preparing for them but I with a 1-2 week old baby I didn\u2019t want anyone else to hold them honestly. There\u2019s a huge biological drive to be physically connected to your child. It was hard to share with my husband even! Later on it\u2019s so much easier and now I\u2019m like \u201chere, hold the baby you\u2019ll be fine\u201d haha but early on? Nope.\n\nIf it\u2019s a genuine problem then I\u2019d recommend he watch a video of someone giving birth. It ain\u2019t pretty but it should give him a solid idea of why you get the say here! Also have him look up postpartum care after watching the video. Would he be comfortable with people coming over while going through all of that? You could also make him wake up every 1-2 hours for a week and see how he feels about hosting people then.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to scare you at all but for real, this is your decision. It\u2019s called the 4th trimester for a reason and it\u2019s hard. You will have a beautiful baby and it\u2019s gets easier but the first two weeks are not the time to start bending to others whims.", "Don't have kids with him. NTA", "NTA. And not just because you need time to heal, bond and get into some sort of pattern with parenting, but to make sure people that come around the baby are healthy. Does everyone have a whooping cough vaccine? Unlikely and that is always highly recommended when around infants. What about COVID and boosters? \n\nTwo weeks is perfectly normal and fine. You will be exhausted, there are risks with early visitors and you need to settle into being a family first.", "NTA - That is a completely fair request, many of my friends and family have done this themselves, even up to 6 weeks in fact, and guess what, we survived waiting and our bond with the baby wasn't impacted by waiting. People can wait. You deserve to have some time to bond with your baby alone in those first few weeks and regain your strength.", "NTA. Lot's of new mothers do the same. When hubby can give birth, he can make the rules.", "NTA", "Nta. Maybe your husband should watch some birthing videos.", "NTA. Makes perfect sense to me. And it is about you! Your husband is being AH", "NTA- I asked for a 2 week wait before visitors with my twins and I loved it.  Luckily my husband was 100% on my side in this.  Most of it was because I wanted time to bond with my children,  but I also wanted time for my husband to gain confidence as a father.  My parents had 7 kids and I figured they might steamroll my husband and his brand new parenting if he didn't have time to get his feet under him.  I'm used to setting boundaries with them. He wasn't. It worked out perfectly.  By the time my folks showed up,  my husband was a baby pro and very confident in their care.  \n\nChild birth is difficult whether you have an at home water birth or an emergency c-section.  It's a lot and turns out the one giving birth has to do most of that work and recovery.  It's not like you're asking for months of time.  It's only 2 weeks and it'll be over in a blink.  He can set the timeline when he delivers the baby.", "NTA\n\nI have given birth and asking for 2 weeks before visitors is not a lot.\n\nYou might offer a compromise like only one day for visitors each week or only the grandparents can come for short visits during that time- no siblings, aunts, uncles, etc if you feel up to it. You can\u2019t really know how you will feel in advance. Your spouse may change his mind about lots of visitors when he is sleep deprived.\n\nRight after my baby was born it was hard to manage things like eating, sleeping, getting a shower. My mom showing up to take care of my daughter for an hour while I took care of myself was helpful. If she had shown up expecting to be entertained and keeping us awake it would have been negative on the visiting right away.", "NTA. The best thing about having a baby during covid was that this wasn't even a discussion. I loved it being just us and it does give you time to settle in. A friend who had a baby a year after me was stuck with relatives trooping through and she was going nuts having to host lunches and the baby couldn't get in a good routine with all the people in abd out.", "NTA. It's your child and your decisions. But I would recommend maybe small short visitation options because it is a special thing for family. My family was understanding and it was for quick 30 minute visits. No one stays. And no one critiques the situation of the house. But you and your child's comfort is the priority", "NTA. it is very normal not to be visited for weeks after giving birth, the baby needs time to get used to being outside of the womb and get to know you and your husband first. you'll also be a mess and will not want visitors at all. plus the baby has practically no immune system, and it's risky bringing all these people around them. do not compromise on this, and if your husband can't be on the same page with you, you need to reconsider having kids with him.", "NTA at all! The only visitor that I had in the first weeks after my daughter was born was my doula. Birth is exhausting and physically traumatic. There's a chance you won't be able to walk for weeks. I was dizzy from blood loss every time I tried to stand up. I was also so exhausted. Giving birth is incredibly physically draining, and then afterward I couldn't sleep. For weeks. You aren't supposed to sleep while holding a baby because you could smash them, but anytime I wasn't physically touching my baby my whole body was screaming, \"I need the baby!\" So I couldn't rest, even with her in a little co sleeping cradle in my bed.\n\nAlso, those first few months after the baby are born is often referred to as the fourth trimester. The baby is sort of still finishing, and your bodies are not really completely separated. At that time, there really isn't a difference in What the baby needs and what you need. You're not being selfish and taking care of your needs, you're being responsible.", "NTA -- I do think as the person giving birth, your preferences override pretty much everything else aside from medical orders. If your husband is going to dismiss those concerns, as it sounds like he is, then you need some serious talks, and counseling would probably be a good idea as well.\n\nI do think it's good to discuss this stuff ahead of time, while you're not pregnant. This is the time to consider ideas, look things up, discuss preconceived notions and etc. Your tempers may flare, but you won't have the additional pressures of parenthood looming, or hormones, or nausea, or whatever. You probably won't solve every difference, but this is the time to find those differences and see where you can arrive at compromises, and where you're going to draw your lines.\n\nHowever, you should also keep in mind that things don't always go according to plan. A home birth is fine, but be aware that things may happen that negate that -- what if you need a c-section? -- so have a backup plan that you're happy with. You might have trouble nursing, or have post-partum depression -- again, now is the time to discuss those things, think about them, talk to a doctor, etc.\n\nI don't know if this is a difference in cultural expectations, or if your husband is really kind of ignorant of pregnancy and childbirth and all that comes with it. This would be the time to try to figure that out.", " NTA\nIt is about you\u2026his thoughts are better placed around you as well. Maybe some education would help him. \nDoes he want people coming over when he is really sick and needs to rest?", "I did this and honestly, it was the best choice we ever made. We got to figure out how _we_ parented before people came to visit, we both got to bond with baby and each other. \n\nThere is so much disruption with a new baby, so much going on with your baby, your body and your psyche, I can\u2019t imagine trying to figure it all out with spectators. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nI feel like your husband should watch some videos on what it's like to be pregnant and/or recover from childbirth. It's not a great time. \n\nOR maybe wake him up every 2 hours during the night for 30 mins, and see if he still wants people over the next day.", "I'm not really sure there's assholery to judge in a purely hypothetical situation...\n\nRegardless, he gets to set the terms for when visitations can happen when he is the one that has to deal with pregnancy and child birth.", "There's about the same \"sentimental and intimate\" if the visitors watch cute cat videos. They can wait.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSit him down and make him watch videos of an actual birth and discuss the realities of what your body will be going through before, during, and after the baby is born. It\u2019s a major traumatic experience physically and he needs to support you and the baby\u2026and no one else. \n\nIf your husband thinks that his family\u2019s right to have that \u2018intimate\u2019 moment of seeing the baby right after he/she is born is more important than how you are feeling about being on display after a vulnerable medical trauma (or him snatching the baby away to put him/her on display while you stay back in another room)\u2026then he is NOT someone that you should have children with.", "NTA \n\nBut plans never go according to what you think in labor. \n\nAlso, I found it was nice when people visited and brought dinner. And I was exhausted so it was nice when someone else helped with the baby.", "NTA. I am in the exact same boat! Due in May and husband wants people over right away and I want time to bond. He has said he \u201cwon\u2019t keep away his parents from their grandchild\u201d.  Newsflash, he is not the one carrying the baby and he\u2019s not the one giving birth. No one knows what kind of labor they are going to have or what recovery will be like. Two weeks is not that long of a wait at all and he needs to respect your wishes.", "Nah. Talk to a good doula or birthing coach. There is a happy medium here including you staying in your room with the door shut and getting some needed sleep during visits", "Not the asshole but let me just say, having help when you have a newborn is super important. You're barely sleeping, you're going through ppd and no matter how much you prepare and read you're still going to be dealing with a lot of on the job training. Family can be tough but they can surprise you sometimes too. \n\nAs far as at home births, please do yourself a favor and look into everything you can about it. I'm sure that's what you do/plan to do when the time comes. I have a close relative who's an obgyn and she will tell you her most high risk deliveries and C-sections are women who tried to have an at home birth and something went wrong.", "NTA - I did this. It was a game changer. I also only did one visitor per day, of an evening when my SO was home etc. \n\nReally, it is such a nice time to not have to worry about the absolute shitshow that is life after having a baby. (Things can be wonderful and a shitshow at the same time)", "NAH. This is a huge milestone for both of you as parents. He seems to want to share it with other people who will be excited to meet the baby. You want to spend time alone. Both are legit but you need to get on the same page.\n\nI loved having visitors after my births. Everyone brought food and held the baby so I could go have a long shower or a nap. It was wonderful to share our happiness with our families. But they also didn't stay very long and were not guests who needed to be entertained.\n\nI know you're planning a home birth, but things don't always go according to plan. My SIL ended up with a traumatic birth and my brother was trying to care for her and the baby. *He* needed support during that time too. \n\nI think it's a bit silly to be laying down hard and fast rules for post-birth when you're not even pregnant but you'll learn that flexibility is one of the most important parts of parenting. See how you feel if/when it actually happens.", "NTA. If he insists on visitors right after birth then he can host them outside your home while you and baby stay home. It\u2019s a shame he\u2019s not more supportive.  This is a boundary I would not give in on. It is what\u2019s best for you and baby.", "You are definitely NTA. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to have visitors who are there to help, so don\u2019t shut that off necessarily. Visitors can bring meals and do dishes and hold baby for you to take a long, hot, uninterrupted shower. While I do think it\u2019s appropriate to be absolutely against hosting guests (and the expectations that come with that) you *can* lay down rules and expectations for anyone wanting to visit that they come to help the new family or they wait until you\u2019re ready for guests. \n\nI have 3 kids. When my second was born, my sister was so exited to come right after to meet him. She came 3 days after he was born. She immediately hugged me and snuggled him for a little bit, and then cleaned my kitchen and took my oldest to the store and bought groceries, and then made us a hot meal. Over the few days she stayed, she did laundry and chores and cooked and let me shower and made coffee in the morning and it was amazing to have someone taking care of me too.", "NTA, but good luck in keeping with the \"no visitors for 2 weeks.\" I mean a home birth (well honestly giving birth in general) will be taxing on you physically, and then there's the stress of a new baby... You may be picking up that phone to ask for help MUCH sooner than you think. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I\u2019m just recovering from an unplanned c-section. After coming home from the hospital I was feeling poorly, but assumed it was because of lack of sleep from taking care of an infant. \n\nMy in-laws wanted to come over and bring us dinner. Mentally I wanted to say, please just leave the food at the door and go, but I didn\u2019t want to be rude, so I stayed up to chat, be a good hostess, etc. They came back the next few days too. They\u2019re a very big, chatty family, and they kind of consider it rude not to be engaged the whole time. I definitely could have said I wasn\u2019t feeling great and left, but I just wanted to put on a brave face because it felt inconsiderate when they brought dinner, etc. \n\nDays when they didn\u2019t come over, I started slowly feeling better because I was able to just nurse the baby and sleep. But then they were over a few days in a row.  Because I wasn\u2019t resting I started feeling worse. I eventually went to an ER and ended up staying in the hospital for 2 weeks without my baby. I had serious infections (RSV, flu, etc.). My baby got sick to and we ended up taking her to the hospital right after I got out. This was with everyone wearing masks, too.\n\nDo NOT allow anyone to push you around with your plans to slowly adapt to parenthood. If your in laws live close, maybe your husband can run the baby up for a quick visit, working around your nursing schedule (if you breastfeed). \n\nJust have him google anything about visitors after giving birth. Pretty much everywhere says do what you\u2019re comfortable with and set strict rules.", "You aren\u2019t selfish at all.  If anything your husband is being selfish as with his request of visitors early is all it does will put major stress and anxiety on worrying about visitors when you are pregnant which is not healthy and can be dangerous to your own and babies health.  And you will stress if you are not comfortable with people visiting.  Stress can be a major health issue and be dangerous.  Eg. Developing preeclampsia. High blood pressure etc.  this is dangerous also after giving birth. \n\nWhen baby is born the first few weeks is vital in the bonding time for mother, father and baby.  If you don\u2019t get that special time with just you and your baby and your own space. I can guarantee that you will resent your husband for taking that special time away from you.  \n\nYou just spent hours and hours going through labour and giving birth.  You spent 9 months carrying the baby.  You went through scans and being prodded.  You went through back aches, leg cramps, vomiting, headaches, insomnia, heartburn, not being able to move around easily, wanting to sleep all the time, being exhausted.  \n\nWhen baby is born you will have just had a major life change and need time for your body to heal. You may or may not have given birth naturally or had a C-section if there are any complications.  You may have tears in your vagina giving birth naturally which needs to be stitched.  Or you may have had a major abdominal operation having a C-section.  \n\nYou will be in pain recovering, you will be feeling vulnerable and you will be very hormonal.   You may experience post natal depression.  \n\nYou will be very protective of your baby. You won\u2019t want to be apart from them or you won\u2019t want anyone to touch them.  This is normal and hormonal and instinctive. (Have you ever been around animals that have just given birth?  Like a dog and pups. Would you dare go near one straight away who may attack). \n\nIt is normal a human mother may not want anyone near their baby straight away and that they want that special time to bond!  The baby will be wanting to be near you all the time as it will want the warmth and closeness of you after being in the womb.  \n\nWhen baby is born It will be a time for you all to get used to your babies routine together and your bonding time which is just between you both and your baby.  You will be sleep deprived and exhausted.  The last thing you need to deal with is visitors at this time.  You will be a new mother and you need the time to get used to your new schedule. It\u2019s going to be hard. You will be up all hours and be feeding all the time and sleeping when baby is. And the days will repeat. \n\nI would advise at least a few weeks before visitors.  You need your space.  Your baby will be mainly sleeping and feeding so people will have to work around baby\u2019s schedule and not theirs!   Those first few weeks are vital and shouldn\u2019t be disturbed.  \n\nIf you have visitors it is important they have a flu shot and vaccinations like whooping cough etc.  very vital.  And don\u2019t let anyone kiss your baby ever!   It\u2019s horrible to read about some babies getting herpes because someone kissed them with a cold sore!!  \n\nSet the boundaries on what you want!  Talk to midwives, doulas and nurses and doctors to explain things and how important it is for mothers those first few weeks.  You are important and your feelings, and decisions are valid and should take priority.\n\nNTA but hubby is.", "NTA - tell your husband when it\u2019s his turn to push a baby out of his body then he can decide when the visitors start to come.", "NTA, but leave your options open. You may find you change your mind. A rough birth and maybe having an extra hand on deck will be helpful. Sometimes to there is a huge feeling of joy that just needs to be shared. Keep an open mind.", "I don't think this makes sense to give your energy to now, since you aren't pregnant and don't know how you'll feel when you're expecting (hint: you won't know until you're there). You don't even know if your spouse will have time off or if you'll have a c-section and can't get up without help. You don't know if you'll develop PPD/PPA or even post-partum psychosis and have no choice in the matter. You don't even know if you can have a baby.\n\nI just find it interesting that throughout most of human history we recognized that we needed a strong community around us, but now we think we can do it on our own.
