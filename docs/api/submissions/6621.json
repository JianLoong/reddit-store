I was in the car waiting while she was getting ready (she'd take forever to get her makeup and hair done). She then came and stood by the passenger door and stared at me. I asked what was wrong and she said \"nothing, I'm just waiting for you to open the door for me\". I was like \"ha? Why I assume both of your arms are working right?\". She said something about seeing a trend on tiktok with guys opening the car door for their gfs to which I reploed with \"that's ridiculous\". She got upset and said it's a gesture that means I respect her and so on and so on. I told her to just get in the car and not make us more late than we already were. She refused. I told her I'd drive off and leave her behind but she said she wouldn't get in unless and until I open the door for her. I ended up just driving off and leaving her behind and going to the wedding alond. She flooded me with missed calls and texts and then we had a huge argument once I got back. She called me awful and said that I caused her to miss the wedding due to my stubborness and selfishness. She then started giving me the silence treatment which made me feel guilty.\n\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673011375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104u38k/aita_for_driving_off_after_my_gf_insisted_i_open/", "score": 1963, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(3) She is blaming you for her own stubbornness and selfishness instead of owning her choices.

I was in the car waiting while she was getting ready (she'd take forever to get her makeup and hair done). She then came and stood by the passenger door and stared at me. I asked what was wrong and she said \"nothing, I'm just waiting for you to open the door for me\". I was like \"ha? Why I assume both of your arms are working right?\". She said something about seeing a trend on tiktok with guys opening the car door for their gfs to which I reploed with \"that's ridiculous\". She got upset and said it's a gesture that means I respect her and so on and so on. I told her to just get in the car and not make us more late than we already were. She refused. I told her I'd drive off and leave her behind but she said she wouldn't get in unless and until I open the door for her. I ended up just driving off and leaving her behind and going to the wedding alond. She flooded me with missed calls and texts and then we had a huge argument once I got back. She called me awful and said that I caused her to miss the wedding due to my stubborness and selfishness. She then started giving me the silence treatment which made me feel guilty.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
