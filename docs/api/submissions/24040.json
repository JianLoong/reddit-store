That\u2019s putting your son\u2019s life in danger and that\u2019s reason enough to not let her watch him. Not to even mention the comments about her trying to nurse your child to calm him (because that\u2019s just freaking strange). If you want to keep the peace, (because you have a newborn and don\u2019t need crazy MIL drama and avoiding it might be key) just make excuses when she wants to watch the baby and make sure you are there when she\u2019s with him.", "NTA. She gave water to a 2-month-old and has talked about putting her boob in the baby's mouth. It would be negligent of you to ignore all of that and leave her alone with the baby.", "NTA. You have to do what\u2019s best for your baby. If your MIL does not respect your wishes when eyes are not on her then she can\u2019t be around the baby alone.", "NTA\n\nOMG, you were 100% NTA with the \"water at 2 months old\" alone. And you should never have had to ask her not to do that. That is not some \"newfangled pediatric suggestion\". My mother is over 80 years old and literally gave me rice cereal in my bottle of formula at a week old (RIP my digestive tract) back in the '70s at the suggestion of my pediatrician because I was apparently endlessly hungry, and even she would be HORRIFIED at the idea of giving water to a newborn!!  You're right, it's so dangerous. \n\nAnd that's really the beginning and end of it: your MIL has done things to endanger the safety of your infant, and refuses to recognise that, therefore she cannot be left alone with him. The end. Of course you're NTA.", "NTA. Your baby, your rules. Your instincts are speaking to you for a reason, and you should listen. Extended family has no absolute rights to anything when it comes to your boundaries and especially when it comes to your children. Grandparents especially can be tough to set boundaries on, so you may have to get creative to keep the peace, but if it comes down to it, you have every right to establish that you are the mother and you get to make the rules exclusively (along with dad). Be civil about it at first, but a constant boundary pusher may need to be put in their place eventually.", "NTA! And make sure your partner (MIL's child) is supporting your decision! Sometimes it's better to have the child (as opposed to the child-in-law) confront the parent that's being difficult.", "NTA\n\nYour instincts are kicking in....this woman doesn't sound right.
