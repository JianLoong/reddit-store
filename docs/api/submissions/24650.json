You don\u2019t bring people\u2019s kids into it. That\u2019s just an AH move.", "ESH other than the daughter. He obviously sucks for bullying you, but you didn't need to bring his child into it.", "YTA\n\nYou went there unprovoked and bullied a 2/3 yo.\n\nHow could you not be the AH?", "YTA. I am sorry that that happened to you when you were young but going right up to a toddler, saying this shit then booping her in the nose? You should not have touched her at all. What you did was immature and ridiculous.", "YTA - 1) don\u2019t touch a child. The \u201cboop\u201d was not cute. \n\n2) if she was young enough for him to be holding, she is either not old enough to understand or too young to be involved at all.

She also speculated about the family\u2019s character and what sort of person that kid could grow up to be.\n\n\nI responded that presumably some bullies grow up to be decent people.\n\n\nI thought I had been completely over for terrorizing me at that point. Normally I wouldn\u2019t have commented at all on a Facebook post like that but the fact that I felt compelled to say anything at all made me realize there were a few lingering feelings.", "Yta if you have problems with the parent, *talk to the parent*.

Like you went out of your way to do this.   \n\nSo someone made your life difficult so your response is to involve their child in stuff?  That just seems like you are becoming what you don't like.", "YTA\n\nyou are an adult now and so is your former bully, did you consider maybe that he is a totally different person now? im 34 and i know im a very different man than i was when i was a teenager in HS. \n\nalso it was completely uncalled for to initiate the interaction and immediately bring his kids into your petty need to get a jab in over shit that happened in the past. be the bigger person, let it go, grow the hell up and move on, stop living 15 years in the past. \n\nchildhood bullies can grow and learn to be respectable adults, but your actions as an adult are certainly not respectable.", "YTA. The kid had nothing to do with the bullying, and your behavior touching that child was wholly inappropriate. You're lucky that kid's father didn't call the cops or flatten you right there. Go to therapy to work out your resentments instead of taking it out on a toddler.", "YTA - Get help.", "Jesus, you should be well over it by now (if not...go to therapy like the rest of us do), and also have some more compassion for a little kid who has no idea who you are or what you're on about. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.

Not so much for what you said to his 3 yr old daughter, though that was childish and dumb, but because you didn't man up, look the old bully father in the eye, and say, \"I hope the boys in her school won't bully your daughter the way you bullied me\" and bopped him right on the nose and walked away.", "You're actually pathetic.

Harassing children is next level and unnecessary. I used to live next to a high school bully, like years after graduating. He had a pregnant wife and I often saw them in their front yard. Not once did I ever think it was appropriate to go over and bash her husband.

I'm sure you might have had times when you made fun of someone as well, even if it was a friend.\n\nBut still, what age was this person when you got bullied? 13? 15? Think of your age now, and wonder how mature a child that age is.\n\nHe was holding his child? So I'm guessing below the age of 8? Maybe even 6 or younger? They have no idea about the world around them.\n\nTouching someone elses kid is a bit wrong. If you just said it, maybe you could argue that you wanted to show the parent just how much the bullying impactes your life to this present day. Perhaps forcing a moment of self reflection. But touching the child is a bit wrong.\n\nAll in all, a lot of people here won't understand because they frankly never got bullied to that extreme. I have witnessed friends or just people at school get bullied and I was always empathatic about it. I saw the hurt it caused, and I see those people struggling to this day, while the people who bullied them are cruising and enjoying life, oblivious to the impact they caused to a whole life, if not equal to how rape affects someone, and I mean that; people kill themselves over extreme bullying. Extreme bullying is life altering and should not be brushed off.\n\nSo, I am reluctant to call you an AH, simply because I feel that moment in life can maybe give you some healing, and to be fair, that child will easily forget that ever happened after a few days since you weren't aggressive with it. But it was uncalled for. It will certainly last longer in the mind of the former bully, but I see he took it as hostile and lacks the self reflection to realie his actions when younger have had a sustained effect on someone. What he saw as fun picking on someone else, has a lifelong effect on that person.\n\nSo, I will say NTA. As long as you don't interact with them anymore. I hope it gave you a sense of closure to the bullying. But you were in the wrong to touch the child.", "What did they want the 2 year old to say? \"I am sorry that my father bullied you, next time I would appreciate it if you don't touch me.\"", "That's the best reply", "Yeah so beautiful talking to a child about events that happened 17 years ago when that child wasn\u2019t even a blip in the universe and then touching them.
