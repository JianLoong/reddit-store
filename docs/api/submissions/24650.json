I'm sure you might have had times when you made fun of someone as well, even if it was a friend.\n\nBut still, what age was this person when you got bullied? 13? 15? Think of your age now, and wonder how mature a child that age is.\n\nHe was holding his child? So I'm guessing below the age of 8? Maybe even 6 or younger? They have no idea about the world around them.\n\nTouching someone elses kid is a bit wrong. If you just said it, maybe you could argue that you wanted to show the parent just how much the bullying impactes your life to this present day. Perhaps forcing a moment of self reflection. But touching the child is a bit wrong.\n\nAll in all, a lot of people here won't understand because they frankly never got bullied to that extreme. I have witnessed friends or just people at school get bullied and I was always empathatic about it. I saw the hurt it caused, and I see those people struggling to this day, while the people who bullied them are cruising and enjoying life, oblivious to the impact they caused to a whole life, if not equal to how rape affects someone, and I mean that; people kill themselves over extreme bullying. Extreme bullying is life altering and should not be brushed off.\n\nSo, I am reluctant to call you an AH, simply because I feel that moment in life can maybe give you some healing, and to be fair, that child will easily forget that ever happened after a few days since you weren't aggressive with it. But it was uncalled for. It will certainly last longer in the mind of the former bully, but I see he took it as hostile and lacks the self reflection to realie his actions when younger have had a sustained effect on someone. What he saw as fun picking on someone else, has a lifelong effect on that person.\n\nSo, I will say NTA. As long as you don't interact with them anymore. I hope it gave you a sense of closure to the bullying.
