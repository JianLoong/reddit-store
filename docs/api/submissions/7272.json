I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with all this", "Hellll naw, NTA, not even a little bit, and your mother ought to be ashamed of herself.  But then again, this isn't the first time she's shown an incredible lack of character.\n\nDo what you need to do to be there for the dad.  You will not regret that, but you would regret if you missed out on any time you have left with him to go out of your way for someone who clearly doesn't appreciate it.  \n\nIn fact, unless you're getting something really great out of babysitting for your mom, I'd stop doing that, too.  Her not being reachable in an emergency can be a potential big problem.", "You really needed to ask? No, you\u2019re not an asshole. But your \u201cmother\u201d is. She can go [       REDACTED       ]. \nOf course I can\u2019t say what I really think. Damn rules. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry about your dad. Do you have somewhere else to go after or do you have to go to your moms?", "Oh honey I'm so sorry. NTA. I wish I could give her a piece of my mind. \n\nEnjoy being with your dad.", "NTA, her kids aren't your responsibility.  \n\nI'm so sorry about your Dad, I was able to be with my Mom before/when she passed and it's such an important and healing memory for me.  Don't let her take that from you.", "I'm so sorry you were  put in this situation. Losing a parent at any age isn't easy, it's far more awful at an age when you need them the most. \n\nIt's not your job to babysit her kids. Period. And the fact that she's willing to say this type of thing to you speaks volumes of her - she sounds  selfish, narcissist and like a really shoddy parent. \n\nYou're clearly NTA. Please make sure that you're taking care of yourself too. If you have other family & friends you can lean on or talk to, do that. And remember that parenting your mom's kids or bending to her demands is NOT your job!!! \ud83d\udc95", "NTA at all.\n\nHave you talked to your dad about his will and what happens after he goes.  \n\nHe needs to put stuff in place so you don't end up at your mothers once he passes.  You may be able to be an emancipated minor and stay where you are with someone else (lawyer or your grandparents or neighbour or some other responsible adult that you trust) looking over you.", "If she complains, ask how much time she wants the twins to spend with her when she's in hospice. (Not how much time you'll spend; she's made it clear you're not her priority). Or say 'You're right, after all, I can just spend time with him next year--oh, wait, I probably won't be able to.'\n\nYour needs matter here. Your WANTS matter. Stand your ground, and take care of yourself.", "The very fact that you say not to cater to OP's mom while saying cater to her is apalling. No matter what the mom is going to be like this. Time with OP's farher is limited.", "[removed]", "NTA your mother is for that \u201cI gave you life\u201d bit!!!", "NTA, but grow a spine and tell your mom to fuck off", "Your mother is despicable. Stand your ground OP. NTA", "NTA if at all possible you should stay with your dad.I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with such a selfish supposed mother.", "NTA\nShe is horrible", "NTA Why do you even watch the kids? She\u2019s basically not even your mother it sounds like/does zero parental duties for you", "If your dad is still of sound mind, PLEASE make sure he has a will made with any assets going into a trust for you. Otherwise,  your mom is going to do whatever she can to get her hands on it. I truly hope you have someone else who will give you shelter and love after he's gone.", "NTA... She abandoned her husband and her child when your dad got sick. You may already understand how disgusting her actions are. Her behavior is selfish and show a lack of concern for you or your well being. \nYou do not need to babysit for her. You need to find support for decisions you may need to make some day. Right now you want to be near your dad, and you should. Talk to your dad or his family about alternatives to living with your mom in the future. Is there aunts and uncles, grandparents? \nBe careful about your future. Find an adult you trust to talk about how to control your own papers such as birth certificates  and bank accounts.  I am sorry that you are forced to grow up so fast. This may make you stronger and mature past your years. Just be smart about choosing your friends and support group. These can include doctors, teachers and counselors, grandparents of friends.... big hugs", "Yes, you are favoring your father and tell your mo exactly why. Let her know he's the one who didn't abandon their family in their worse moments and that he's dying so time with your father is your #1 through 10 priorities right now. NTA.", "Honey, don't feel bad. Respectfully, you're going to lose someone incredibly important to you far too soon. I'm so sorry that your mom is not the parent that you deserve. Spend as much time with your dad as possible. I pray that you and your family find peace.  If you ever need to talk, reach out to a trusted person in real life. If not, reach out online. Sending you virtual hugs and prayers from Texas \ud83d\udc9e", "NTA. Your dad may not be with you much longer and you should enjoy every minute you can with him. You will never regret spending more time with people you love before they die. I can\u2019t imagine you would ever regret missing out on one more opportunity to babysit.", "I'm sorry about everything here. I really hope you don't have to end up living with her. Even if your dad wasn't in hospice, a 15 year old shouldn't be solely responsible for twin 10 month olds until 2am or later when the parents won't answer their phones. What if there is a medical emergency? NTA.", "OP should absolutely throw that back in her mom's face!  She should use those exact words to her mom - bet the babysitting requests will stop. \n\nNTA", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Please stay with your father. You can ask Hospice to send the social worker to talk to to, they should have real resources for youth who are going through this with their parent. \n\nAlso take videos with your dad, even if it seems hard to do or he doesn't look like he used to before he was sick. He sounds like an amazing dad.\n\nYour mother is - well it's pretty low of her to ask anything of you right now. I will tell you this, parents are supposed to be there for their kids, not the other way around.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't deserve your time if she won't answer her phone, stays out that late & said those awful things to you. Spend as much time as you can with your dad.", "op=NTA\n\nKeep favoring your father and spending this precious time with him.\n\nAnd after when you are stuck with your Mother, I hope you keep telling her no--if she can't be bothered to answer her phone, refuse to be responsible for them.", "NTA AT ALL", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s complete lack of empathy for you and your dad is amazing. You are her child, not her childcare. Don\u2019t think on it anymore - you\u2019ve done nothing wrong."]}
