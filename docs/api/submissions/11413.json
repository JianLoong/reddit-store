E was telling me that mom was begging M to bleach her hair and was telling M that she'd look better and mom was asking her aswell to bleach her hair but E declined. M's hair was brown before hand.\n\nWhen we got back home I texted my ex to see why she wanted to bleach our daughters hair and that M was saying that she wanted her hair to be a different color.

I asked if she wanted to go salon, she said yes\n\nThe people working at the salon were asking me who did M's hair and I said their mom. They were all kinda worried looking because bleach is quite harsh and M's hair looks damaged. Well they used a safe non permanent purple hair dye on M's hair and she loved it.

I think not. Honestly I'd be concerned about your ex making other changes to M's appearance in an effort to \"make her look like\" her mother.", "NTA. She damaged your daughter's hair and that's not a one-parent decision. You put in a temporary dye (which will fade after a couple weeks), which should have been no big deal though maybe using a non-natural color is pushing it. \n\nBut the real problem is your ex's \"I want my brown-haired daughter to be blonde like me\" an emotionally-problematic statement. Your 9yo daughter is not your ex's plaything or mini-me. You might want to speak to your lawyer and get this clarified to your ex. She can't hurt/damage your daughter to make her different. That's abusive.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your ex has **serious** issues and really needs therapy.  It sounds like she's treating your daughters, not as independent people with their own desires, but basically as living dolls for her to do with as she pleases.\n\nGranted, they're not yet full adults, but as you correctly point out, they can (within your reasonable limits) decide what they want to look like.  It's their own bodies, after all.\n\nIt's **not** up to your ex to **force** your daughters to be blonde because she really, really wants them to be blonde.\n\nBodily autonomy is a **really** crucial lesson for your daughters to learn and it's great that you're supporting them in this.  And your ex is being a total AH for taking it from your daughters.", "NTA. And honestly id be seeing if you could move for more custody. Bleaching a childs hair is not something anyone without training should do. She could have actually harmed your child. \n\nPlus the whole \u201ci want her to look like me\u201d just screams issues too. \n\nIm sure a judge would love to hear all about this.

You did the right thing to get her to the salon.\n\nI would also put this event in a diary, and keep screen shots of the text messages.

You listened to your daughter and let her exercise some control over her body/appearance. Your ex trying to make your daughter look like her is pretty screwed up, it often happens naturally between kids and parents but trying to force it is just ick.", "NTA. Your ex pressured your young daughter into letting her use an unsafe (since your ex clearly didn\u2019t know what tf she was doing) treatment to change her appearance and freaked out when you actually listened to your child and corrected the mistake.\n\nShe ruined your daughter\u2019s hair and manipulated her into agreeing to an appearance altering process that your daughter was clearly against. Who even does that? So controlling,", "NTA. Your wife needs to learn that your daughters are not her personal Barbie dolls to dress and style however she wants. They are human beings with their own agency and opinions.

I hope M's hair recovers quickly from the damage from the bleach", "NTA. Their mother used harsh bleach (which can damage hair long term) on a *nine year old* without asking you, and against what your daughter actually wanted. You at least took your daughter's wishes into consideration, and the salon used a safe, non-permanent dye so it'll eventually rinse out regardless.", "NTA but ex certainly is. Boundaries! I think she may be one of those people who thinks that everyone should be like her. What'll be next? The way ex wears her makeup or the clothes she wears?

Purple is often a hot topic issue.

Your ex pressured your daughter to dye her hair and then did a crappy job without ever consulting you about the change so why would you consult her about changing the color to something your daughter wanted. \n\n My mom always wanted me to be blonde. I never realized how much that damaged the way I saw myself.   She refused to buy my sister a brunette doll at her 7th birthday party at build a bear and would only let her pick blonde, pink, or blue hair.  You can be damn sure I bought my sister only brunette dolls from then on so she wouldn\u2019t see her self worth by how blonde her hair was.

There is no way what she did is appropriate.", "I feel like I've read this before, but NTA. It's worrisome that her mother cares that much about her hair being blonde.", "NTA yes, the picture was likely petty, but what your ex did was awful for your daughter. I can\u2019t imagine if my mother had destroyed my hair on a whim. Letting her pick a fun color was exactly what she needed. Yes, it will need to be touched up, but it\u2019s a special kind of therapy for your little girl.", "NTA. It sounds to me as though your ex only sees her children as an extension of herself, or (even worse) as toys that she can play with rather than people. I agree with the other Redditor who said you should consider pushing for more custody. It may seem dramatic, but having that type of perspective of your own children can very easily lead to (more?) abuse.", "NTA. Mom needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d also like to recommend hair dye conditioner! If she has light hair, you can just use it as regular conditioner, leave it in for 15 minutes, and it\u2019ll keep her hair that color for quite a few washes! It\u2019s also great because you can have blue hair one month and pink the next. Personally, it healed my hair SOO much and made it a lot less stringy and dead lol", "NTA.

How dare you do something she didn't approve of but the daughter wanted but it was fine for her to do something the daughter didn't want simply to stroke her own ego without even letting you know?  Your poor daughter.

Why give me the person who's actually fixing your self made nightmare a hard time. I don't know why, all I know is that they do.\n\nYour ex wreaked your kids hair herself. Now she's defensive of the mistake. Why? Who knows, it's not even her hair she fucked up. No need to feel bad taking it to a pro to fix the mistakes. \n\nI don't know why people would make a big deal about it anyways", "She\u2019s mad at you for doing something she didn\u2019t approve of after doing something that neither you, or more importantly, your daughter approved of? What kind of hypocrite logic? NTA obviously", "ESH\n\nYou should be co-parenting. Though you did what your daughter wanted, sending your ex a picture afterward almost reads as revenge. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI am in no way justifying what your ex did. She could have seriously damaged your daughter's scalp. She not only put your daughter in danger but lied afterward. I wouldn't be surprised if she has done this before. Consider asking your daughters if your ex has tried to convince/force them to do other things.\n\nEdit: OP isn't the ah for changing their child's hair. I am simply saying that for your child's best interest either the mother has to go, or you work something out(Seems like she needs therapy or loss of custody).

I have dark blonde hair which turns a slightly lighter blonde in the sun; she always referred to it as \"dish water blonde\" which obviously didn't make me feel great. \n\nFrom the time I was like six years old, she put in lemon juice and Sun In Spray to make my hair blonder when I was going to be spending time outside. At age twelve, she started adding highlights to it herself. She used this crap product where you put a cap with tiny holes on it over your head and then use a small hook tool to put little strands of hair through. And holy shit did that process hurt, like seriously! When I was in high school, she took me to the salon regularly to have my hair extensively highlighted (bleached blonde more like).\n\nMy mom essentially wanted a little doll she could dress up. She curated my wardrobe (I didn't pick my own clothes until I was in my late teens). For example, she didn't want me to wear short skirts or shorts because I had \"chunky looking knees\". She saw I was putting on weight in middle school (not an unhealthy amount, it was just baby fat) and made me go on a diet. I slimmed down a lot when I went to high school, and she still harped on my weight. I developed a mild eating disorder, and it gave me a life time of body image issues and low self esteem. I ended up throwing up food and even self harming because I was disgusted with my own body and felt I should punish it/myself. The only time she thought I looked good enough was when I developed a problem with my digestive system and dropped several pounds until I was underweight. \n\nMy self esteem never recovered. I am 35 and feel ugly to this day. Yes, I'm in therapy. But if she had been a good, loving mother who accepted her daughter for who she was, maybe my mental health wouldn't be quite as bad as it is. Maybe not. She was abusive in many other ways, too. I have extensive self harm scars. \n\nDo not let your ex do this kind of crap to your daughter. It will affect her self esteem and make her feel not pretty enough. Your daughter should look the way she wants to look and decide for herself what makes her feel beautiful. You should have a conversation with both of your daughters to see if their mom is making any other negative comments about their appearance.
