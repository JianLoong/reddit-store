So you e.g. can't throw out any 20 year old shirts, even with holes in them, because \"I got them there and there\" or \"my mother gifted me that shirt when I was 15\" (said person is in late 30s). So they just sit in the wardrobe forever.\n\nSo said friend and their spouse had more or less the same situation like you, OP, but the bath mats were a coffee table (ugly, old, damaged) which the father gifted my friend for their first (single) apartment. It did not fit in their new house, did not match the furniture AND it was wonky as well. I experienced that whole ordeal first hand otherwise I wouldn't believe someone can get this worked up over an old piece of furniture. The friend even cried as if the coffee table was a pet they had to rehome, it was weird as fuck. \n\nMy friend got into therapie for addictive personality later on and this behaviour was also a pretty big point of discussion with the therapist as far as I know from their spouse. I don't know if there is a specific term for it but it's definitely not a sign of mental health to act like that.\n\nNTA but this might be not about the bath mats, your husband might have some mental issues where this excessive clinging to things, especially those with \"sentimental value\", is a symptom.", "This is NOT about bath mats/you 'insulting' his parents' taste.

Then the next hurdle is whether the trauma has locked us into learned helplessness or not. Learned helplessness denies sufferers the chance to imagine a different future. In an experiment involving electrocuted dogs in crates, the poor things had to be dragged out by the scientists because they wouldn't leave, even though they were intense pain. Then there's depression which strips victims of motivation, and anxiety that makes victims unimaginably afraid of leaving the dangerous yet familiar.

You can talk to a domestic abuse helpline and get support. You can walk into a doctor surgery and get support. Nobody will judge you for putting your kids first.

He covers the baby\u2019s mouth to stop the baby from breathing and she\u2019s still there?? \n\nOP I feel for you and you are a victim but at the same time if you don\u2019t get those kids away from him ASAP then you\u2019re enabling his abuse. Your eldest child is 4 and is already showing signs of PTSD. I hope you get out, stay safe.", "He is a **** \ud83e\udd2c\n\nNeed to get your *vulnerable* children away from him. Stopping the baby breathing? \ud83d\ude21physically assaulting the 4yo? \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "If a partner ever so much as verbally abused my child,  they would have been booted out of my life in an instant.  OP please take your innocent children and go to a women's shelter.  Take your and their SS cards, birth certificates,  and leave the rest.  Just get out and protect those children.   Do not tell your husband that you are leaving.", "I never said he wasn't abusive.  Never defended the dudes actions.  I read OPs post and made the judgement that she's NTA.  And yet here you are saying I'm defending an abuser.  Wtf?", "This is so important. It's not just important in a divorce to have access to your own money, but in the event of death or severe injury also.", "My husband puts money in my accounts regularly \"just in case\"", "Yeah I totally agree with that.\n\nI knew this one guy (sort of related) and he got into a bad deal with his car payment so he declared it stolen.  I asked if was it really.\n\nhe goes \"Well it's buried so deep,  they'll never find it\"", "You said ignore people that are telling her this is abuse", "Same here.   \nBut she keeps writing those posts and going to therapy and... is still with this man. I think, she needs somebody (a friend, sister, whoever), who will help her to do some action - kick off the husband (she writes she's making 90% of the household money) or move out.", "Holy crap.  I would hide them in my garage apartment if OP were close to me.  Gated.  OP needs some time and space to feel what reality is like outside abuse again.", "My dad had a cardiac arrest a few years ago (he's fine now) and it was made so much more stressful by the fact my mum didn't know how to access any of their online banking and didn't have any bank account of her own. She had no idea how much was in each of their bank accounts, or how to pay their bills. Dad was in hospital for nearly a month and most of that was spent in a coma or drugged to the gills so he couldn't help. Everyone should have their own bank account and if you have shared finances, both partners should be involved.", "After reading ops description of what this guy does to her children and her he should be in that car.", "She's making 90% of the money? then why the hell is she even talking to him about bath mats? Just do the thing you want to do. \n\nAnd, if he is abusive, throw him out. You do NOT want your kids in that toxic environment.", "He\u2019s the one who is waaaaay overreacting. As in red flag overreacting.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to walk on egg shells around him. Still \u201c learning his triggers\u201d after 10 years? No, no, no. With most people at most there are 1 or 2 \u201ctriggers\u201d, as in things that make them truly livid. Preferably you know what they are in each other before marriage or living together. Your husband has a serious anger problem to put it mildly.\n\nFrom my experience, bath mats are worn out after 10 years. They LOOK 10 years old! Even if they matched the decor you\u2019d be needing to get new ones. Replacing them is NOT insulting his parents. They\u2019ve probably even forgotten what they gave you by now. (I sure would have.)\n\nNTA!!!", "Dad had a heart attack in 1983. Mom opened her own CCs, took out a car loan in her name only so when, years later, he died, she was fine.", "That\u2019s not unusual, sadly. Especially in the older generations.\n\nWhen my mom died dad knew how to access everything, but didn\u2019t know the specifics on bills, stocks, etc. (Mom really had a head for finances\u2026. Dad, not so much.) Consequently, Dad had a huge learning curve. He also had to learn how to grocery shop, as things had changed dramatically since he\u2019d been a bachelor 40+ years earlier. Sharing these chores are sooo incredibly important!", "This a million times. Even if you only start with 10 bucks a paycheck. Put something away and act like ya don\u2019t have it.", "I'm amazed that people can't just read 7 paragraphs and respond. It takes 1 minute tops.", "That's how abusive relationship is working.   \nShe here has all the possibilities to live her independent, peaceful life. She earns a good money, she pays all the bills, she does all the household work.  \nAnd still isn't able to do anything, because her husband, after 10 years of abusive marriage, \"crippled\" her so much.", "Seriously! This was my thought also. Picture it: an adult man walks into a house, pouts, and says, \n\n\"Mom! Dad! Can you believe it?! My wife threw out those bath mats you got us for our wedding!\" \n\n\"... Haha, that's so funny, I could have sworn we got you silverware!\" Mom responds, laughing.\n\n\"Why do you remember what we got you, were they important or something?\" asks Dad, looking quizzical.\n\nTheir son looks anguished and begins sobbing dramatically.\n\n*The End*", "This wouldn\u2019t even be a discussion in our house. I\u2019d show up with new bath mats and that would be the end of it."]}
