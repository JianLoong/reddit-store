I\u2019ve held two officer positions, created & managed a very successful social media account for the union, led the planning for our recent picket, got us tons of news/media coverage, & served on our bargaining team. I became friends with a nurse who decided to serve on our bargaining team this year. She has been a nurse in our union for almost 20 years, but this was her official first involvement with the union. I have only been a nurse for 4 years but have been involved since year 2. I have had numerous conversations with her over the last few months where I literally begged her to consider becoming more involved as an officer once our bargaining season was up. \n\nOne of our current co-chairs announced she is retiring and I have made my intentions of going for that role extremely clear after I got the blessings of the other union officers and the other co-chair (about 4-6 months ago). So now this friend decided to run against me & the current co-chair, despite saying she wasn\u2019t sure she had time to be involved. She is still telling people that she knows she can\u2019t make it her top priority but she feels she needs to run because a few friends nominated her (and she self-nominated..). I tried explaining that this both hurt personally and professionally as well as that I genuinely think it is not wise as she has zero experience and would rely (I.e. lean) far too heavily on the co-chair. Things have turned pretty ugly. I respect that she has a right to run, but wow does it feel personal! I keep wavering on feeling like I\u2019m being petty or justifiably angry\u2026. So AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for the feedback. I forgot to include one of the biggest reasons I\u2019m upset (and shared this with my friend) is that I think there\u2019s a very good chance she & I will be the ones elected, ousting the current co-chair who deserves it (by her hard work, dedication, & knowledge! As in, she will do the best job) most of all.", "created_utc": 1667284135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj0wps/aita_for_being_upset_that_a_friend_decided_to_run/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have elections because the position isn't anointed.  \n\nYou asked her to get more involved.  Well...she is.  Also, you may really love what you are doing for the union.

I understand you\u2019re concerned this will unseat someone else more qualified, but you can\u2019t craft all of the outcomes you want\n\n- getting more participation from people like your friend\n- winning your position\n- keeping your co-chair in their position \n\nWhile unseating your co-chair would be sad, remember that there are silver linings, like getting more people involved.", "That\u2019s not my issue or concern necessarily. I agree with that. My issue is her running when she knows she doesn\u2019t have the time, and knowing it pits her against myself and the current co-chair.", "That\u2019s fair. To clarify, I begged her to be involved as a specific role that didn\u2019t have a huge time commitment because she said she didn\u2019t have a lot of time. I didn\u2019t make that clear, but yeah I can see how that sounds.", "You\u2019re right. I kept myself anonymous for our social media page, my lead role in the picket, and on how big of a role I played in things so tbh I\u2019m not sure if people really know all of that. I don\u2019t want to actually campaign anymore after thinking on it for a day bc that would only add drama, IMO.", "Fair. I didn\u2019t post this part, but I\u2019m not worried about being elected myself, more so that she and I will be elected and the current co-chair who deserves it most will be ousted.", "My point still stands.  Don't ask someone to become more involved, then get upset when they do it."]}
