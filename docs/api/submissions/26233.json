He hung up after that with no further explanation. The kids were frantic asking me what was going on and I did my best to stay calm in this situation but it was obvious that this was scaring me to.

Enjoy your vacation though!", "NTA, especially if there is a chance that y'all could need to move very quickly for the aforementioned \"safety\" reasons. \n\nInfo: Can you tell us his job or anything related to it?", "INFO: WTF does your husband do for work?", "NAH. Your husband should have the common sense to realize that given the nature of his job, the conclusion you came to is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the only other conclusion is travel by choice for leisure which means HE ruined the surprise vacation. \n\nHow are you not supposed to make inferences / assumptions when he urgently asks for your passports", "NTA\n\nAt this point in your marriage, he should be aware you tend to get anxious and rather than dismissing your feelings he should recognize he went about the situation wrong. Unfortunately, many times people get caught up in the excitement of doing a good thing and don\u2019t always think about ambiguity from the other perspective. For example, right before I had our second child, my husband\u2019s boss told him he hired someone who had a very similar role and when my husband asked what that meant for him, was just told \u201cwe\u2019ll talk about it when you get back.\u201d My husband spent his paternity leave anxious about his job, and it turned out he was just getting adjusted duties which could have been stated earlier. The boss didn\u2019t think about it, because it wasn\u2019t bad, but the ambiguity really messed with my husband. \nI\u2019m sorry he doesn\u2019t recognize how his approach contributed to your anxiety.", "NTA if I got a call like that I would be scared too. Asking where the passports are because it's 5/5 urgent when you're driving is not a normal thing to do in my world.", "NTA\n\n To me, a 5 out of 5 on the urgent scale is STOP everything, turn the vehicle around and get the passports NOW!\n\nIf that is not needed, it is not 5/5 because then it is not the most urgent thing possible.", "ESH. He told you it was fine and you would talk later. You overreacted and caused your kids to freak out too.", "Imagine the audacity of the man! Surprising his family with a vacation!
