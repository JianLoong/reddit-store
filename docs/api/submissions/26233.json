Your husband should have the common sense to realize that given the nature of his job, the conclusion you came to is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the only other conclusion is travel by choice for leisure which means HE ruined the surprise vacation. \n\nHow are you not supposed to make inferences / assumptions when he urgently asks for your passports", "NTA\n\nAt this point in your marriage, he should be aware you tend to get anxious and rather than dismissing your feelings he should recognize he went about the situation wrong. Unfortunately, many times people get caught up in the excitement of doing a good thing and don\u2019t always think about ambiguity from the other perspective. For example, right before I had our second child, my husband\u2019s boss told him he hired someone who had a very similar role and when my husband asked what that meant for him, was just told \u201cwe\u2019ll talk about it when you get back.\u201d My husband spent his paternity leave anxious about his job, and it turned out he was just getting adjusted duties which could have been stated earlier. The boss didn\u2019t think about it, because it wasn\u2019t bad, but the ambiguity really messed with my husband. \nI\u2019m sorry he doesn\u2019t recognize how his approach contributed to your anxiety.", "NTA if I got a call like that I would be scared too.

YOU turned it into an emergency.", "NTA, he should understand why you were worried. but maybe for the future you guys should adopt the habit of rating things from 1-5 for time based urgency, and 1-5 for situational importance (example 1 is a vacation and 5 is medical emergency) or something similar.", "NTA.

Which again, valid to be concerned but like he isn\u2019t an asshole for that. Sometimes you don\u2019t completely think things through I guess, he said it\u2019s a 5 because it\u2019s urgent like maybe he had time then and was doing the bookings and all and needed the passports right then to proceed, maybe he was too focused in that to see that you may be terrified by such a request.", "NTA.

I try really hard to be upfront with my teams \u201cI need to chat with you about x - it\u2019s nothing to worry about\u201d.

And let it expire. Several times. To be fair, though, the last time was 2020 and we inadvertently let our twins expire while actually living abroad. Realized in 2021 and had to have them urgently issued. Darn 5 year passports for kids. Many Americans have never left the US so did not need to bother getting one. And for many years growing up mine was kept in the \u201cimportant papers drawer\u201d with all kinds of random stuff. When you can travel through mountains, deserts, beaches, plains and never need a passport\u2026 knowing where it is isn\u2019t that important. Now your driver\u2019s license?

Calling people names because they made a generalisation\u2026 that\u2019s pretty weird/ intense of you.\n\nOf course I don\u2019t think all Americans / Europeans are the same. It\u2019s also not unreasonable to think that if you live in a country that is absolutely enormous  and where you can drive for days barley crossing state lines that you might use your passport less than a country where you can cross three borders in a day!\n\nAlso - I think you should probably know where you store important documents. Not sure why that\u2019s so controversial\u2026", "I read it that way too and figured maybe the big island in Hawaii.. then reread it..", "Stop assuming things that were never provided on the post.
