I'm also in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend so we try to see each other at least once a month by coming to each others dorms and spending the weekend. The dormitory rules say that you can have sleepovers as long as your roommate agrees on it. When this roommate moved in i mentioned that i sometimes bring my bf over if its okay with her and told her that i wont bring him over while shes there. She didn't really have much to say about that so i just thought that its fine. \n\nThis Tuesday was a state holiday so everybody had a prolonged weekend and most of the students go home in that period of the year. I also went home and so did my roommate. When i was leaving i told her when will i be back and she said that she still doesnt know when she will be back but she is going to text me to let me know. \n\nThen this Wednesday i returned and saw that she is not here so i just texted her saying: hey, im back in the dorm, was just wondering when are you coming? She didn't respond, the only reason i asked her this tho is because she said that she will let me know and didn't and i get easily scared so i just dont want her to come in in the middle of the night while im sleeping without knowing who is coming in. Today, its Friday and she still didn't respond so i just kind figured that she is gonna stay for another weekend home. So i text her again saying: Hey, i was just wondering if you are not coming back this weekend, can my bf come for a sleepover? She still didnt respond for a few hours and then she sent me this giant text saying that she is busy, and to never ask her again when is she coming back, she cant answer my texts and that she is not a guest to give me a notice on when she will be back. She told me that she doesn't care who comes to my side of the room but when she is back she doesnt want to see anybody there and the room has to be wiped clean after he leaves. \n\nI was kinda shocked bc i just asked her if its okay and i didnt ask her that bc i demand to know where she is all of the time i just dont want her to come and see anybody there like she said she doesnt want. So to me it just seems like i can bring someone over only if i can read minds and know when will she be coming back bc she doesnt want to say.\nSo, am i the asshole for asking?", "created_utc": 1667577749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym2tea/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_when_will_she_be_back/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get it that she doesn\u2019t have to tell you when she\u2019s coming back - but a \u201cI am not sure at this time sorry\u201d or \u201cI am quite busy and don\u2019t fully have my schedule planned out\u201d would have been appreciated.\n\nIt\u2019s good of you to want to keep her feelings a priority when it comes to you having guests over. But like you said, you can\u2019t read minds and you tried what you could.", "Kind TA. You\u2019re not her parent, your anxiety doesn\u2019t mean you can hound someone on their return. You shouldn\u2019t have asked her so many times on her return. Instead say \u201chey, do you mind if my boyfriend stays over these days\u201d and leave it at that. I would be pissed if I had a roomate up my ass on my return. She may be going through shit and you hounding her is overstepping", "NTA\n\nRoom mate: \"I will not tell you when I will be back but no one should be there when I do comeback\"\n\nWhile she has no obligation generally to tell you when she will or wont be there, as she lives there, that demand is impossible to comply with. If she wants to set conditions like that she needs to communicate when she'll be around.", "NTA. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask your roommate about their plans. It\u2019s normal. Is something maybe going on with her? That seems like a gross over reaction to someone taking interest in your life and plans. Also how can she expect you to have your boyfriend gone and the room cleaned before she returns.. when you don\u2019t know when she\u2019s gonna return??", "NTA - you were polite in asking if maybe a bit insistent , she definitely overreacted in her response.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
