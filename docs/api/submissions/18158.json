I don't really try to build a relationship with them as they never tried with me. I only talk to them when it's involving our dad.\n\nSo about three years ago my dad had to move back to his home country because it's cheaper to live there. But my dad has to see his pulmonologist for his severe asthma every 4 months or so. The first two years I was the one able to pay for my dad's travel expenses without the help of my siblings. I was also the one who would always take him to his doctor's appointments, make sure he has all the medication he needs, etc. But then in Nov 2022 I had to get back surgery so I was out of work for a couple of months. During these couple of months my dad's health was declining. Every time I would call him I can hear him wheezing just by talking. \n\nIn April, I got desperate. I texted my brother \"Hey would you be able to go thirds (about $200 each) with sister so dad can see his doctor. His oxygen levels are getting really low and he needs his doctor.\" He then said that he wasn't able to because he bought some new cameras and had trips planned to go to Mexico. So then I texted my sister and she just said \"Ill talk to my brother. Bye.\"\n\nTwo weeks or so go by and I never get an update from my siblings. But my dad's doctor called me and told me that if he doesn't see my dad soon he won't have him as a patient anymore. Which made me get more anxiety and stress thinking my dad is suffering and going to die. Thankfully my mom said she would put in the money for the plane trip. The next week my dad came to the states and was finally able to see his doctor. \n\nSo here is where I might be an asshole, I know my siblings care so much about their image online. They will always post photos with my dad to seem like they're a perfect family,  especially if I'm not there. So I knew if I made a post it would piss them off. I posted a photo of my mom, dad, and me in the car coming from the airport. I had the caption saying something like \"For the past MONTHS I been trying to have my dad come see his doctor. It's been hard since of my surgery but thanks to MY MOM my dad was able to come. Family are suppose to help each other in need whenever we can and I'm so grateful my mom was able to help my dad. Thank you so much.\" Not once did I mention my siblings on how they didn't help me or anything. But literally 5 mins of making that post my sister goes ape shit.

You didn't mention your sister, her guilt is on her.", "ESH. Obviously your siblings suck for not helping. But you purposefully made a post to piss them off, and you're asking us if it makes you the asshole to piss people off on purpose? Yes.", "THIS. That's also why I did it. When my dad was leaving to live permanently to his home country I took him to the airport. My brother came in his own car just to say bye for a quick minute and take some photos to post on FB. Then he left. On FB he put some BS about how he couldn't stand that my dad was leaving, waited to see him get on the plane and blah blah. He's also had times where he will sell watches and stuff to my dad but then put on FB that he got it for him as gifts. It just annoys me to no end knowing how they actually are with him vs what the post online.", "Couldnt have said it better.", "My dad was the typical provider for my siblings. Everything they wanted he would give them. He's even got a house for each of us for when he passes away (In his home country just to clarify). He paid for their education even if they changed majors a lot. My dad even helped my brother get a job with him.  Their mom would also take care of my sister's kid until the kid was 22 years old. Everything that was important to them my dad will try his best to go to such as graduations, birthdays, all the typical stuff. He would also call them frequently and try to see them as much as he could. I'll be completely honest, my dad is a wonderful father but just in a crappy relationship with their mom. So he left their mom to be with mine and that's when I was born. My brother was happy for my dad but my sister just hated me since the womb.\n\nWhenever it comes to money with my siblings they're selfish. They always say they don't have any money yet buy the most expensive items they want for themselves.  Granted it is their money and they can do what hey want so whatever. Plus they just assume my dad has all the money in the world although he's been retired and doesn't make money anymore. And they know that I'm the sibling whos always willing to pay for anything that involves my dad. \n\nWhen I asked my brother back in April he said no because he just bought a new camera or drone?? plus a trip to Mexico. When I asked my sister, she just said and I quote, \"Ill talk to my brother. Bye.\" but when I saw on FB its because she was having a huge party for herself.\n\nMy dad has enough money to live in his country but since his health started declining 2 years before he retired he didn't expect the extra costs so it was just easier to have me help him. And my mother doesn't make a lot of money either but came up with some money in April and told me she could help us.", "Same thought.  Was OP  from a second marriage?  Did dad desert first family oorr 2nd wife?\n\nWhy don't the older siblings help?  Sosnt seem to a financial reason  for the brother?\n\nOr are they just assholes?  Could be as sis realized it was her OP was talking about\n\nForgot  NTA", "He got the homes dirt cheap like about 50 years ago? Because of inflation + now that the country is becoming safer to live, it did raise value on the homes. He actually lives in one of the houses now and my sister in the other. The last house he rents (like $150/month) so he can make money there to pay his bills. \n\nHonestly, I tell him to sell the houses so he can have money for himself. It\u2019s not fair for him to work his whole life and not be comfortable himself. But he says he\u2019s going to die soon and he wants to make sure me and my siblings have a backup incase anything happens to us.\n\nAlso fair point, my siblings and I don\u2019t have to pay it but I also know if we don\u2019t get him the help he needs he will die. Which is why whenever I can I do pay his plane tickets. If my siblings don\u2019t want to help him out with his health then fine. But it\u2019s BS for them to say they love him and will do anything for him online when in reality they don\u2019t care.", "Maybe it'd because I'm closer to her age but I like her petty post.", "Holy shit thats super fake and pretty cringe.", "How old is your mom? Are your parents still together? What do you mean by \u201ctry his best to go to such as graduations, birthdays, all the typical stuff\u201d? Did he miss these, is that why you  say \u201ctry\u201d?

Idk if this helps but my dad got with my mom once my siblings were adults. So in their childhood he was there both emotionally and financially. As they were adults my dad did start being less emotionally there for them but still help financially as much as he could even when he was with my mom. \n\nAnd I said try because he was working a lot in their childhood and may have missed a school event (like parent teacher conference) or two when they were growing up but would always try to make it up for them. But he never missed a Graduation or birthday. \n\nAnd fair enough on the budgeting.", "He was probably trying to use the \"moment\" to also show off his new toy. My mom was very much like that. One of my biggest regrets in life was joining the Army as a young adult over a decade ago and almost everyone I know now would have no clue I was in the army. Some who knew me then almost forget that I was. \n\nBut it didnt stop my mom (who I seen maybe 2 times a year) from posting a picture of me at the end of basic training every veterans day and on my birthday on fb with captions like, \"proud of my soldier!\" To posture to her goofy conservative friends... basically became a running joke with my wife and I when we'd see it pop up on fb. Lmao.\n\nSo I totally get it.", "NTA she\u2019s mad because her narrative of being a loving, generous, attentive daughter has just been called out.", "nta lol you simply stated facts", "NTA", "YTA because your post and replies have missing reasons and narratives that you accept, but cannot verify. \n\nYou also don\u2019t mention your mom\u2019s exact age.

Seems fine to me. If they are angry it\u2019s because they are making it about them, maybe as a sign of their own guilt.", "NTA. You didn't actually call them out. No one except them would know you're taking shots at them. And, of course, there's the projection. She's accusing you of always making yourself look good when that's what she's been doing.", "You are the super hero!  Kudos for looking out for your dadm", "NTA\n\nYou didn't even mention them. They wouldn't know it was a callout unless they knew they done messed up.", "ESH. \n\nThem for obvious reasons.\n\nOP because, well, posting family drama, especially in a passive aggressive manner, on social media is trashy/cringe behavior for teens. IMO of course.", "NTA. I would hope her complaints are via text.", "No. He separated from their mother and a year later or so got with mine.", ">He's even got a house for each of us for when he passes away (In his home country just to clarify).\n\nCan he not sell the houses kept for your half siblings? Ideally, your dad should be using all money he has for his own life. Neither you nor your half siblings are entitled to an inheritance. \n\nAnd now if you are the only one helping him out, he should cut them off and use that money to pay for his life.", "I 100% agree with you. I tell him that he should sell the houses and get the money for himself. All his life he worked for us so now it's his time to do whatever he wants. I even tell him that to make it easier on him that he should sell \"my\" house and have the other two be given off to my siblings if he wants because at the end of the day I just care for him. But he always argues and says he cant do that because he needs to know once he passes away we will have a backup plan.", "I call a BS on the houses. There's something else going on here. You don't move to another country for the savings and then buy all your kids a house there making yourself so poor you can't afford treatment. Why can't he get treatment in his home country. I doubt it's free but surely it can't be cheaper to get on a flight for what's a regular visit.", "Yeah but he's not unwilling to pay because he's being selfish with the money, he's doing it because he feels like leaving his kids houses would work out to be far more valuable to them than the costs of travel in his final years. Probably a legacy thing too, like the last thing he can give his kids. So I say NTA", "I feel sorry for the trouble you are in. Old people do act crazy. In this case his \"backup plan\" is ruining your \"main plan\"", "Dude in this case your father created this situation for himself. There is a clear solution to his problem that he refuses to take\u2026 if you want to bail him out great but I wouldn\u2019t pay medical bills for someone that technically has the means to pay for them but won\u2019t out of stubbornness.", "You really don\u2019t know that because you weren\u2019t there", "I think I do it because I don't see it as stubbornness but instead as being a father till his very last breath? He still wants to take care of us even in his afterlife which I'm very grateful for because I do know he loves all of us.", "Fair point. I was basing it off what everyone says. My siblings, the ex-wife, uncles, aunts, my mom, just everyone. \n\nI know my siblings do love my dad but whenever it comes to money they don't really help which is fine, whatever. \n\nWhen he was hospitalized 5? years ago, my brother did visit and call everyday. When I was growing up my dad would take me and my siblings to theme parks almost every weekend. My brother also did come to my college graduation. I also know my brother calls my dad every other day. \n\nSister on the other hand is a different story. I remember my dad always sending money to her every week for whatever she was into at the time. He helped her with her business too. She's the one who mostly posts on Facebook about her being the perfect daughter and having the perfect dad. But when my dad was in the hospital for a week she never called him. She never tried to check up on him or anything. Yet when my dad was doing the paperwork to give us the houses she would call him everyday. Its just frustrating.", "How is he caring for you if he\u2019s requiring you to make financial sacrifices for him? It sounds like it\u2019s the other way around, you\u2019re caring for him.", "Tbh this may sound harsh but it sounds like your dad was irresponsible with his money, buying houses for the kids before saving for retirement is not the move. \n\nUsing your children as a retirement plan is also a pretty crappy move. I think it\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re willing to personally fund his medical bills but it\u2019s unreasonable to put that same expectation onto your siblings imo and judge how they spend their money, while funding your dad\u2019s lack of retirement from his own bad spending decisions.\n\nThey\u2019re also allowed to take pictures with him at family gatherings and post about how much they love him. Just because they\u2019re setting boundaries on their financial obligations doesn\u2019t necessarily mean their love and personal relationship with their dad is less valid.", "I can see your point. I think maybe its because in our culture its expected that the kids are suppose to help elders. Like how he did with his parents now he's expecting his children to do the same. Sucks but he is my dad and I'm willing to help him as much as I can. Just have to wait a while to go back to work (: \n\nOnce I'm back on my feet I know I'll be able to do everything again. Everything will be okay.", "I get that it can be cultural, it also isn\u2019t fair to demonize people who choose to live their lives outside of their own cultural norms. \n\nIt also sounds like it could create a vicious cycle. Are you able to start saving for retirement yourself? How long are you on the hook for your dads medical bills? It sounds like his condition is chronic so if he lives to be 90 you could spend tens of thousands of dollars keeping him housed healthy and comfortable. That\u2019s a HUGE personal sacrifice for someone who technically has assets he can sell to pay for himself.\n\nI know you\u2019re young but with retirement plans it\u2019s really important to start early if you can because it builds on itself, and the financial decisions you make now can be the difference between being comfortable in your old age and being stuck in a shitty budget nursing home with abusive staff. $1,000 in a Roth IRA now can build to quite a bit by the time you turn 65, but if you wait until you\u2019re in your 30s it\u2019s way less. Or are you going to be up a creek without a paddle and relying on your own children 40 years from now to make sacrifices to keep you off the streets? What if you can\u2019t have children? Or they don\u2019t have the funds to help you? Or god forbid they die in a horrible car wreck? Will you just be on the streets?\n\nI know these are tough questions but genuinely I hope you consider them for your own sake."]}
