I don't have a good relationship with my siblings mainly because of the age difference and being the \"other\" sibling. I don't really try to build a relationship with them as they never tried with me. I only talk to them when it's involving our dad.\n\nSo about three years ago my dad had to move back to his home country because it's cheaper to live there. But my dad has to see his pulmonologist for his severe asthma every 4 months or so. The first two years I was the one able to pay for my dad's travel expenses without the help of my siblings. I was also the one who would always take him to his doctor's appointments, make sure he has all the medication he needs, etc. But then in Nov 2022 I had to get back surgery so I was out of work for a couple of months. During these couple of months my dad's health was declining. Every time I would call him I can hear him wheezing just by talking. \n\nIn April, I got desperate. I texted my brother \"Hey would you be able to go thirds (about $200 each) with sister so dad can see his doctor. His oxygen levels are getting really low and he needs his doctor.\" He then said that he wasn't able to because he bought some new cameras and had trips planned to go to Mexico. So then I texted my sister and she just said \"Ill talk to my brother. Bye.\"\n\nTwo weeks or so go by and I never get an update from my siblings. But my dad's doctor called me and told me that if he doesn't see my dad soon he won't have him as a patient anymore. Which made me get more anxiety and stress thinking my dad is suffering and going to die. Thankfully my mom said she would put in the money for the plane trip. The next week my dad came to the states and was finally able to see his doctor. \n\nSo here is where I might be an asshole, I know my siblings care so much about their image online. They will always post photos with my dad to seem like they're a perfect family,  especially if I'm not there. So I knew if I made a post it would piss them off. I posted a photo of my mom, dad, and me in the car coming from the airport. I had the caption saying something like \"For the past MONTHS I been trying to have my dad come see his doctor. It's been hard since of my surgery but thanks to MY MOM my dad was able to come. Family are suppose to help each other in need whenever we can and I'm so grateful my mom was able to help my dad. Thank you so much.\" Not once did I mention my siblings on how they didn't help me or anything. But literally 5 mins of making that post my sister goes ape shit. She started saying how why am I making them look bad, that I'm always making myself seem like the super hero and them villains, and blah blah blah. \n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1685033204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rmqyn/aita_for_indirectly_putting_my_siblings_on_the/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your siblings for not helping and you for calling them out online. I know you didn\u2019t mention their names, but you know exactly what you did and why you did it.", "NTA, I wouldve have made a snide comment in that post about them", "NTA. You didn't mention your sister, her guilt is on her.", "ESH. Obviously your siblings suck for not helping. But you purposefully made a post to piss them off, and you're asking us if it makes you the asshole to piss people off on purpose? Yes.", "THIS. That's also why I did it. When my dad was leaving to live permanently to his home country I took him to the airport. My brother came in his own car just to say bye for a quick minute and take some photos to post on FB. Then he left. On FB he put some BS about how he couldn't stand that my dad was leaving, waited to see him get on the plane and blah blah. He's also had times where he will sell watches and stuff to my dad but then put on FB that he got it for him as gifts. It just annoys me to no end knowing how they actually are with him vs what the post online.", "Couldnt have said it better.", "My dad was the typical provider for my siblings. Everything they wanted he would give them. He's even got a house for each of us for when he passes away (In his home country just to clarify). He paid for their education even if they changed majors a lot. My dad even helped my brother get a job with him.  Their mom would also take care of my sister's kid until the kid was 22 years old. Everything that was important to them my dad will try his best to go to such as graduations, birthdays, all the typical stuff. He would also call them frequently and try to see them as much as he could. I'll be completely honest, my dad is a wonderful father but just in a crappy relationship with their mom. So he left their mom to be with mine and that's when I was born. My brother was happy for my dad but my sister just hated me since the womb.\n\nWhenever it comes to money with my siblings they're selfish. They always say they don't have any money yet buy the most expensive items they want for themselves.  Granted it is their money and they can do what hey want so whatever. Plus they just assume my dad has all the money in the world although he's been retired and doesn't make money anymore. And they know that I'm the sibling whos always willing to pay for anything that involves my dad. \n\nWhen I asked my brother back in April he said no because he just bought a new camera or drone?? plus a trip to Mexico. When I asked my sister, she just said and I quote, \"Ill talk to my brother. Bye.\" but when I saw on FB its because she was having a huge party for herself.\n\nMy dad has enough money to live in his country but since his health started declining 2 years before he retired he didn't expect the extra costs so it was just easier to have me help him. And my mother doesn't make a lot of money either but came up with some money in April and told me she could help us.", "Same thought.  Was OP  from a second marriage?  Did dad desert first family oorr 2nd wife?\n\nWhy don't the older siblings help?  Sosnt seem to a financial reason  for the brother?\n\nOr are they just assholes?  Could be as sis realized it was her OP was talking about\n\nForgot  NTA", "He got the homes dirt cheap like about 50 years ago? Because of inflation + now that the country is becoming safer to live, it did raise value on the homes. He actually lives in one of the houses now and my sister in the other. The last house he rents (like $150/month) so he can make money there to pay his bills. \n\nHonestly, I tell him to sell the houses so he can have money for himself. It\u2019s not fair for him to work his whole life and not be comfortable himself. But he says he\u2019s going to die soon and he wants to make sure me and my siblings have a backup incase anything happens to us.\n\nAlso fair point, my siblings and I don\u2019t have to pay it but I also know if we don\u2019t get him the help he needs he will die. Which is why whenever I can I do pay his plane tickets. If my siblings don\u2019t want to help him out with his health then fine. But it\u2019s BS for them to say they love him and will do anything for him online when in reality they don\u2019t care.", "Maybe it'd because I'm closer to her age but I like her petty post.", "Holy shit thats super fake and pretty cringe.", "How old is your mom? Are your parents still together? What do you mean by \u201ctry his best to go to such as graduations, birthdays, all the typical stuff\u201d? Did he miss these, is that why you  say \u201ctry\u201d? When you say \u201cprovider\u201d, do you mean financially or emotionally?It also sounds like he didn\u2019t actually budget enough money for his retirement, everyone gets unexpected health issues as they age", "So, it sounds like your dad could pay for himself, but is unwilling to.\n\nIf I were in that situation, I think I'd have a hard time paying his way as well.\n\nBut I also wouldn't be posting shit online about being willing to do anything for him, etc etc.\n\nSo I don't really know where to go with this one.", "Im in my 30's and agree with you. Post was entirely justified. And she didnt call them out directly which is a good demonstration of tact.\n\nNTA. People who posture on FB for fabricated familial image make me wanna puke.", "Oh and that\u2019s that I failed to mention that he came on his little Segway thing too. It\u2019s just \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f even in the photo he posted he got on the little stupid thing to pose for a photo with my dad. I just thought it was cringe to being a $500 Segway to a international airport just for a photo with my dad.", "Mom is in her 60s. They aren\u2019t together anymore, separated when I was 5. Idk if this helps but my dad got with my mom once my siblings were adults. So in their childhood he was there both emotionally and financially. As they were adults my dad did start being less emotionally there for them but still help financially as much as he could even when he was with my mom. \n\nAnd I said try because he was working a lot in their childhood and may have missed a school event (like parent teacher conference) or two when they were growing up but would always try to make it up for them. But he never missed a Graduation or birthday. \n\nAnd fair enough on the budgeting.", "He was probably trying to use the \"moment\" to also show off his new toy. My mom was very much like that. One of my biggest regrets in life was joining the Army as a young adult over a decade ago and almost everyone I know now would have no clue I was in the army. Some who knew me then almost forget that I was. \n\nBut it didnt stop my mom (who I seen maybe 2 times a year) from posting a picture of me at the end of basic training every veterans day and on my birthday on fb with captions like, \"proud of my soldier!\" To posture to her goofy conservative friends... basically became a running joke with my wife and I when we'd see it pop up on fb. Lmao.\n\nSo I totally get it."]}
