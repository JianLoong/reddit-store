I don't really try to build a relationship with them as they never tried with me. I only talk to them when it's involving our dad.\n\nSo about three years ago my dad had to move back to his home country because it's cheaper to live there. But my dad has to see his pulmonologist for his severe asthma every 4 months or so. The first two years I was the one able to pay for my dad's travel expenses without the help of my siblings. I was also the one who would always take him to his doctor's appointments, make sure he has all the medication he needs, etc. But then in Nov 2022 I had to get back surgery so I was out of work for a couple of months. During these couple of months my dad's health was declining. Every time I would call him I can hear him wheezing just by talking. \n\nIn April, I got desperate. I texted my brother \"Hey would you be able to go thirds (about $200 each) with sister so dad can see his doctor. His oxygen levels are getting really low and he needs his doctor.\" He then said that he wasn't able to because he bought some new cameras and had trips planned to go to Mexico. So then I texted my sister and she just said \"Ill talk to my brother. Bye.\"\n\nTwo weeks or so go by and I never get an update from my siblings. But my dad's doctor called me and told me that if he doesn't see my dad soon he won't have him as a patient anymore. Which made me get more anxiety and stress thinking my dad is suffering and going to die. Thankfully my mom said she would put in the money for the plane trip. The next week my dad came to the states and was finally able to see his doctor. \n\nSo here is where I might be an asshole, I know my siblings care so much about their image online. They will always post photos with my dad to seem like they're a perfect family,  especially if I'm not there. So I knew if I made a post it would piss them off. I posted a photo of my mom, dad, and me in the car coming from the airport. I had the caption saying something like \"For the past MONTHS I been trying to have my dad come see his doctor. It's been hard since of my surgery but thanks to MY MOM my dad was able to come. Family are suppose to help each other in need whenever we can and I'm so grateful my mom was able to help my dad. Thank you so much.\" Not once did I mention my siblings on how they didn't help me or anything. But literally 5 mins of making that post my sister goes ape shit.

When my dad was leaving to live permanently to his home country I took him to the airport. My brother came in his own car just to say bye for a quick minute and take some photos to post on FB. Then he left. On FB he put some BS about how he couldn't stand that my dad was leaving, waited to see him get on the plane and blah blah. He's also had times where he will sell watches and stuff to my dad but then put on FB that he got it for him as gifts. It just annoys me to no end knowing how they actually are with him vs what the post online.", "Couldnt have said it better.", "My dad was the typical provider for my siblings. Everything they wanted he would give them. He's even got a house for each of us for when he passes away (In his home country just to clarify). He paid for their education even if they changed majors a lot. My dad even helped my brother get a job with him.  Their mom would also take care of my sister's kid until the kid was 22 years old. Everything that was important to them my dad will try his best to go to such as graduations, birthdays, all the typical stuff. He would also call them frequently and try to see them as much as he could. I'll be completely honest, my dad is a wonderful father but just in a crappy relationship with their mom. So he left their mom to be with mine and that's when I was born. My brother was happy for my dad but my sister just hated me since the womb.\n\nWhenever it comes to money with my siblings they're selfish. They always say they don't have any money yet buy the most expensive items they want for themselves.  Granted it is their money and they can do what hey want so whatever. Plus they just assume my dad has all the money in the world although he's been retired and doesn't make money anymore. And they know that I'm the sibling whos always willing to pay for anything that involves my dad. \n\nWhen I asked my brother back in April he said no because he just bought a new camera or drone?? plus a trip to Mexico. When I asked my sister, she just said and I quote, \"Ill talk to my brother. Bye.\" but when I saw on FB its because she was having a huge party for herself.\n\nMy dad has enough money to live in his country but since his health started declining 2 years before he retired he didn't expect the extra costs so it was just easier to have me help him. And my mother doesn't make a lot of money either but came up with some money in April and told me she could help us.", "Same thought.  Was OP  from a second marriage?

The last house he rents (like $150/month) so he can make money there to pay his bills. \n\nHonestly, I tell him to sell the houses so he can have money for himself. It\u2019s not fair for him to work his whole life and not be comfortable himself. But he says he\u2019s going to die soon and he wants to make sure me and my siblings have a backup incase anything happens to us.\n\nAlso fair point, my siblings and I don\u2019t have to pay it but I also know if we don\u2019t get him the help he needs he will die. Which is why whenever I can I do pay his plane tickets. If my siblings don\u2019t want to help him out with his health then fine.

As they were adults my dad did start being less emotionally there for them but still help financially as much as he could even when he was with my mom. \n\nAnd I said try because he was working a lot in their childhood and may have missed a school event (like parent teacher conference) or two when they were growing up but would always try to make it up for them. But he never missed a Graduation or birthday. \n\nAnd fair enough on the budgeting.", "He was probably trying to use the \"moment\" to also show off his new toy. My mom was very much like that.

Some who knew me then almost forget that I was. \n\nBut it didnt stop my mom (who I seen maybe 2 times a year) from posting a picture of me at the end of basic training every veterans day and on my birthday on fb with captions like, \"proud of my soldier!\" To posture to her goofy conservative friends... basically became a running joke with my wife and I when we'd see it pop up on fb.

I tell him that he should sell the houses and get the money for himself. All his life he worked for us so now it's his time to do whatever he wants. I even tell him that to make it easier on him that he should sell \"my\" house and have the other two be given off to my siblings if he wants because at the end of the day I just care for him.

I doubt it's free but surely it can't be cheaper to get on a flight for what's a regular visit.", "Yeah but he's not unwilling to pay because he's being selfish with the money, he's doing it because he feels like leaving his kids houses would work out to be far more valuable to them than the costs of travel in his final years.

When I was growing up my dad would take me and my siblings to theme parks almost every weekend. My brother also did come to my college graduation. I also know my brother calls my dad every other day. \n\nSister on the other hand is a different story. I remember my dad always sending money to her every week for whatever she was into at the time. He helped her with her business too. She's the one who mostly posts on Facebook about her being the perfect daughter and having the perfect dad. But when my dad was in the hospital for a week she never called him. She never tried to check up on him or anything. Yet when my dad was doing the paperwork to give us the houses she would call him everyday. Its just frustrating.", "How is he caring for you if he\u2019s requiring you to make financial sacrifices for him? It sounds like it\u2019s the other way around, you\u2019re caring for him.", "Tbh this may sound harsh but it sounds like your dad was irresponsible with his money, buying houses for the kids before saving for retirement is not the move. \n\nUsing your children as a retirement plan is also a pretty crappy move. I think it\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re willing to personally fund his medical bills but it\u2019s unreasonable to put that same expectation onto your siblings imo and judge how they spend their money, while funding your dad\u2019s lack of retirement from his own bad spending decisions.\n\nThey\u2019re also allowed to take pictures with him at family gatherings and post about how much they love him. Just because they\u2019re setting boundaries on their financial obligations doesn\u2019t necessarily mean their love and personal relationship with their dad is less valid.", "I can see your point. I think maybe its because in our culture its expected that the kids are suppose to help elders. Like how he did with his parents now he's expecting his children to do the same. Sucks but he is my dad and I'm willing to help him as much as I can. Just have to wait a while to go back to work (: \n\nOnce I'm back on my feet I know I'll be able to do everything again. Everything will be okay.", "I get that it can be cultural, it also isn\u2019t fair to demonize people who choose to live their lives outside of their own cultural norms. \n\nIt also sounds like it could create a vicious cycle. Are you able to start saving for retirement yourself? How long are you on the hook for your dads medical bills? It sounds like his condition is chronic so if he lives to be 90 you could spend tens of thousands of dollars keeping him housed healthy and comfortable. That\u2019s a HUGE personal sacrifice for someone who technically has assets he can sell to pay for himself.\n\nI know you\u2019re young but with retirement plans it\u2019s really important to start early if you can because it builds on itself, and the financial decisions you make now can be the difference between being comfortable in your old age and being stuck in a shitty budget nursing home with abusive staff. $1,000 in a Roth IRA now can build to quite a bit by the time you turn 65, but if you wait until you\u2019re in your 30s it\u2019s way less. Or are you going to be up a creek without a paddle and relying on your own children 40 years from now to make sacrifices to keep you off the streets? What if you can\u2019t have children?

I'm guessing because of how specific his medication is? Idk. I got this information from my dad and sister. So its cheaper to pay the $600\\~ every 4 months.

I know from the money I would get from the house would be significant I would use that for my retirement. I can make my own money for my own things later. I plan on making more than enough money to the point where I can help both my parents and myself.

It's another to try to publicly shame them for not doing exactly as you wanted them to.", "NTA. Ask her what about the post isn't true.", "How do you know that you weren't the result of a affair?  Because the way you write it it sounds like it were they mean to your mother?", "Yes", "NTA, you never once mentioned them. As they say: IF THE SHOE FITS, WEAR IT.", "NTA. if you don\u2019t wanna \u201clook bad\u201d don\u2019t make yourself look bad.", "No. I\u2019m just the other sibling who has a different mom that\u2019s it.", "As an African, many of our people abroad have houses here. \n\nAlso, not every place has god medical facilities. My country being one. \n\nStop calling BS on just because you cannot imagine something. \nEverything Op wrote here is very very within reason", "He probably has Medicare. I know a lot of people who retire to their home country and just come back to the US for doctor's appointments.", "No they were never mean to her. I know growing up at one point my brother even lived with me and my parents. He was just starting to work with my dad and I was like 3.\n\nEdit: sorry forgot to add. This is coming from my mom. She\u2019s never spoken ill on my siblings and nor my brother to my mom. My sister just hated me because my dad got with an other women period. Like 15 years after my mom he got an other girlfriend. Sister hates her too because it\u2019s not her mom.", "NTA\n\nIf they don\u2019t want to look like uncaring AHs then they shouldn\u2019t act that way.", "I know this isn\u2019t the main issue, but are there no pulmonologists in your dad\u2019s country?  It sounds really expensive and inconvenient for him and you for him to be traveling so much for appointments.\n\n  \nIt\u2019s not healthy for you physically, emotionally, or financially to make your dad\u2019s wellbeing your responsibility. If he can\u2019t afford his own expenses, he should sell one of his extra houses! Your half-sibs aren\u2019t wrong for not \u201csetting themselves on fire to keep someone else warm\u201d like you\u2019re doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA regarding the specific Facebook post, but kinda TA for judging your sibs harshly for not making the same extreme choices you are. Also, you really don\u2019t know what reasons they have for not being as involved in your dad\u2019s life. Don\u2019t just take other peoples word for it that they had great childhoods. Things can look really different on the outside, even to extended family.", "Right?\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be cast as the villain maybe stop being so villainous. What selfish jackasses. If someone makes you look bad simply by telling the truth than that\u2019s on you not them.\n\nNTA- it\u2019s clear all that matters to them is their image; sometimes you gotta hit them where it hurts.", "Now I\u2019m just thinking about this guy I read about that drove his Segway off a pier. Think it was on a top 10 list of Darwin awards.", "NTA", "ESH them for literally everything about them by the sounds of things.\n\nYou for deliberately doing something to piss them off, telling us that's why you're doing it and then acting shocked and innocent when it does piss them off, all within the same post.", "YTA - As is anyone else who uses social media as a weapon to attack others.", "OK, perhaps it was a bit mean.  But you didn't make sis and bro look bad, they made themselves look bad.  NTA"]}
