{"id": 13450, "submission_id": "1256i1y", "title": "AITA for not waiting on my girlfriend to go to Wal-Mart", "selftext": "So to preface:\n\nI love my girlfriend, she is amazing, but she is the type that absolutely refuses to leave the house without at least some make up on. Personally, I find it completely ridiculous, she's gorgeous in any state (maybe I'm biased on the one), but if it helps her feel as beautiful as she is, more power to her. Plus I'm not dumb enough to pick that hill to die on. Maybe I am dumb though, I'm sure you guys will tell me. On to the issue.\n\nAs some of you may know, since their release, PS5s can be very difficult to get your hands on. I had been saving for a while hoping to get myself one for Christmas, but that didn't work out. On a whim I decided to check online, lo and behold, the Wal-Mart right down the street had one. So I eagerly ordered it, paid online, and got ready to go pick it up. She sees me all excited and putting my shoes on and asks qhere I'm going. I tell her and ask if she needs me to pick anything up while I'm there. She says no, but she wants  to come with me. I say okay cool, lets go. She wants time to go get ready. Get ready to go to Wal-Mart. Maybe I'm being a dick here, but there is absolutely no scenario where she is the worst looking person in a Wal-Mart.\n\nSo I told her it was already paid for, I just had to run in and grab it, she didn't even need to get out the car, and they close in 90 minutes. She scoffs at me, tells me it won't take her that long, and goes to the bathroom. Then I hear the shower turn on.\n\nAt this point, I have wanted a PS5 for longer than I have known her, and it is right in my grasp. I text her that I'm going and will be right back (she didn't have her phone in the bathroom), go and get it, and make it back in less than 30 minutes. She is still in the bathroom, didn't even know I left. By the time she got out, I was halfway through setting it up.\n\nAnyway, now she's mad and claiming I abandoned her (at her own apartment) and that I care more about a video game than I do about her (which feels pretty unfair, and by that logic, she cares more about her make up than she does about me getting something I've been looking forward to for years, though I very quickly learned that was the wrong thing to say).\n\nSo now I have an angry girlfriend and a PS5 that I can't turn on without starting an argument. So I humbly ask you, Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit to update: I have an ex-girlfriend and the Resident Evil 4 remake. Great game, highly recommend.", "created_utc": 1680046888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1256i1y/aita_for_not_waiting_on_my_girlfriend_to_go_to/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
