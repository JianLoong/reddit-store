Their 16 year old son, Tom, didn't want to move and change schools and leave his girlfriend. I invited Tom to stay with our family for 5 months; after that it was expected he would move in with his grandparents.\n\nTom never moved, he was doing stupid teen stuff and made his grandpa mad, so grandpa refused to take him. And Tom refused to move to his parents'. So I invited Tom to continue to stay with us, I didn't want him to be homeless and mess up finishing high school. \n\nTom did more dumb teen stuff. I eventually had enough and said straighten up or move out. Tom got his life together after that, and it's been going fairly well. My only complaint is he spends every dime he earns despite us telling him he has to save something out of every paycheck. He relies on me or his girlfriend for rides. \n\nTom is set to graduate high school in June. He's hinting that he wants to stay here after he graduates. His girlfriend's family is very religious and from a different culture and I'm sure they would never allow them to move in together unmarried, and I have no reason to think they're going to get married as soon as they graduate. \n\nI don't see how Tom is going to be able to afford to move out on his own after graduating but I would like him to leave. Nothing personal but I'm tired of being responsible for this young human that I only expected to have for five months. Tom could move to his parents' home but he absolutely refuses, because he hates where they live.\n\nLiterally every person I have talked with about the situation has told me I would be an awful person if I asked Tom to move out after he graduates. They think I should let him stay until he decides he's in a position to move out on his own. But being as he hasn't saved any of his paycheck at this point, it could be a very long time before he's ever able to move out on his own. \n\nTom earns about $600/month and his bills are $150/month. He spends the rest doing fun things with his girlfriend. After working for the past almost two years, he has $2 in his bank account. When we talk to him about it, he agrees to save money and will save for a paycheck or two, and then he'll blow it all. I've tried to help him budget and plan. I would probably offer to let him stay if he were saving up and just needed a little more time.\n\nSo WIBTA if after the first of the year, I told Tom he needs to plan on moving out after he graduates in June or at least after he turns 18 next July?", "created_utc": 1668734311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy7b12/wibta_if_i_asked_a_teenager_to_move_out/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if he could find a roommate to split the costs with, I think it would be very possible.", "His family has not sent any money. All I've ever asked them was for them to send Tom money for personal things like clothes and haircuts and whatever. However I don't think they do very often.

Their only response was \"Well he can come live with us if he wants to but it's his life and he's old enough to decide for himself what he wants to do.\" I don't talk with them much but I've mentioned to them a couple of times that I'm concerned about the fact that Tom has no money saved for a car or his future and they will say that they agree there's no excuse for it and they'll talk to him. But nothing changes.", "I thought my parents were doing this for me bc I was paying rent and they had talked about it before. I never saw that money again but it also motivated me to never live there again bc I can pay rent anywhere and not be constantly criticized soooo this would be really cool for someone at this age but you don\u2019t owe it to the kid to give the money back. It\u2019ll be like practice for real life", "NTA - you're giving him notice and a clear boundary and it's realistic for him to be able to achieve that (even if he has to get a room in a shared house). However you should be checking in with him to make sure he's able to stay on track and get his parents involved so they can help him out, too.", "So basically you are providing his needs. Housing and food. Definitely talk with him about the arrangement was only for him to finish school. If he wants to stay then you need to set rules and boundaries. Once he is 18 he is legally an adult and has to care for himself. Hopefully you can figure something out and maybe discuss it with his parents too.", "I mean about the possibility of him being kicked out next year not about saving money", "So you keep parenting him for them?", "I was just thinking this. Part of the reason that I moved out of my house is that even as an adult paying rent I would have to live by someone else's rules. It was worth it to me to pay a full rent and be able to have peace at home than pay 1/5 rent and constantly feel like I was walking on eggshells.", "I have not.  I am worried that if I tell him he needs to leave next year he's going to get an attitude and everyone in the house will have to deal with it. And the couple of friends I've confided in made me feel like I was making a cruel decision so I've held off because of that too. I was waiting until I was sure of what I wanted to do, and until after the holidays. I was hoping by now he would be saving up and have a plan for after graduating and I would work around that. At this point he is talking about taking some online college classes after graduating and that's it. \n\nI do want to give him a lot of advanced notice so I was planning on saying something after the first of the year", "Should definitely tell him, if you tell him now it may just be an attitude, if you tell him next year and he finds himself scampering to find a place it may be more than just an attitude", "You\u2019ve been more than generous. You want your space back. The sooner you tell him the better so he can figure something out. \n\nNow that he\u2019s straightened out maybe he can reconcile with the grandparents.

You did him a huge favor and basically got bowled over for it.", "NTA this kid has no relation to you. And your good will has an expiration date. Tell him now and help him plan. Ie plan savings, plan with the fapsa for school. Him not living with you doesn't have to be scary. He can either follow the plan and do well or he can fail. But that's the hard boundry.", "INFO \n\nAre his parents paying you anything to house and feed their kid???\n\nI honestly can\u2019t believe you let this go on for this long. 5 months was generous. Now you\u2019re just a doormat.", "So do the absolute opposite of what op wants ? Like do people like you not read the post and just make shit up? Op wants to kick the kid out not increase the rent.", "NTA. I would tell him now that he either needs to move out by x date OR (if you wanted) that he will start paying x rent by x date. It would be one thing if he literally had no where else to go, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all. You should also communicate this with his parents.", "Definitely NTA. Tell him now that you all can't accommodate him after he graduates. Say that you feel you have been very generous with him, that you're happy to see him grow into a fine young adult, but that it your turn to have your house to yourself. Don't waver from this.  \n\nIf you really need to, you could make up something that will necessitate his moving out.  Maybe that you are moving to a smaller place, and need to clear things out and get house repairs done, etc. Then, later, you can tell folks you looked around, weighed your options, and decided to stay. \n\nFor those that are saying you should let him stay, tell them to take a turn having him live with them. Also, call his parents and grandparents and let them know he cannot stay past graduation.", "NTA as long as you start to communicate properly with Tom. There are several ways to go for you:\n1. If you want him gone after he graduates, tell him he will have to move out by date mm.dd.yyyy\n2. If you want to give him a bit more time, make it clear that from date xyz he has to pay rent in the amount of xyz plus utilities etc. Make a list of the cost split by cost per item and tell him that he can stay until final end date, when you want him to move out.\n3. Whatever you do: keep it in writing \n\nWhoever tells you, you are an awful person is free to take him in or pay his rent to you!", "NTA but you can help him. Make him pay you rent. Put it on a bank account and give it to him when he graduates. \nBut you still can remove him from your home. You owe him nothing. He can choose: follow your rules or move. Simple as that"]}
