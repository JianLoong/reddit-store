{"id": 26363, "submission_id": "16cbv4l", "title": "AITA for telling my downstairs neighbour that me expressing milk for my premmie baby will be my priority over his sleep?", "selftext": "So, my daughter was born over 3 months early. She's doing ok but she still have periods where she Bradly desats (braddies) where she stops breathing, oxygen saturation drops in her body and goes bright blue. She does this at least once a day and because of this, she is still in the NICU with no current projection for when she's coming home. The only thing I can do to help her is to give her cuddles and provide her milk, which means expressing for 20 minutes minimum on each boob every 2 to 3 hours, including over night. \n\nI have also had problems with flees in my home (they've been awful for everyone in my area this year), so I've torn up all carpets and thrown away my sofa and mattress, so I'm currently sleeping on the floor on a blow up mattress with my fianc\u00e9. This means that any noise that I make, no matter how much I try to minimise it, carries downstairs to my neighbour.\n\nI express milk over night, once at 11:30pm, 1am and then at 6:30am. My neighbour downstairs knocked on my door this morning and complained about my 1am alarm waking him up. I apologised and told him that I can't turn that specific alarm off because it's the expression that impacts my milk flow and doing that expression will prompt me to produce more milk over the day. I'm already under enough stress that my milk flow has already been impacted ( I was producing around 100ml and I'm down to 50 to 70 ml). I need the alarms because I cannot miss my expressions, I already feel guilty enough that I'm not producing as much as I was.\n\n I explained all this to him and he still said that it wakes him up and that he can't sleep after it wakes him up. I again apologised and said to him that I can set my alarm between 1am and 3:30am, and he can choose from between those times. He said I should just turn the alarm off and I responded that I can't, because I can't afford to sleep through my expressions times. He then said that I should express after 5am, which isn't possible because the hormones that help produce more milk are at their peak at between 1am and 4am. \n\nHe complained about it waking him up again and I angrily responded that \"My daughter is premature, she needs my milk and I will do everything to make sure she's got as much as she needs, including waking you up at 1am because I need to express!  She is my priority, not your sleep.\" I closed the door in his face. \n\nI just spoke to one of my friends and she's telling me that I'm the asshole because my daughter is eating every 3 hours and I'm making just enough milk every time for at least one meal for her, so \"it won't hurt to not express the 1am expression\" but it honestly IS the most important expression for milk production.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not stopping expressing at 1am even though I know it wakes up my neighbour?\n\nETA: many people have suggested I put the phone on vibrate, which would be a fantastic solution if it wasn't for the fact that I have slept straight through having injections or having a cannula put in (I was awoken long enough to give permission to have it put in). I'm open to solutions, but putting my phone on vibrate isn't going to work.", "created_utc": 1694081002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cbv4l/aita_for_telling_my_downstairs_neighbour_that_me/", "score": 1045, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Reading your additional comments, it sounds like this dude just doesn't like you and thats why he's having a problem with it. If he is so sensitive to sound that he wakes up when a neighbor uses the bathroom at night, he either needs to move to a building thats better sound proofed or use ear plugs to sleep.  He can't blame you for the noise if he was already waking up because of you using the bathroom before you had to replace your carpet. \n\nI recommend trying to get a rubber/foam mat to throw down in your sleeping area until you can get your fabric stuff replaced to help lessen the noise, and just set your alarm on your pillow or something like that. Maybe you could try waking up to an alarm thats flashing lights too, but I don't know how easy those are to get, or if they even have apps that will do it on your phone. But that could maybe help wake you up without noise. But if all you have is your regular alarm, that's all you can use. Its not unreasonable to hear an alarm from a neighbor in a building that isn't well soundproofed. Unfortunately thats part of most people's experience with living in a shared building. Its unreasonable to expect other people to stop existing in their own units just because the building is poorly sound proofed.\n\nI hope your baby gets better and is able to come home soon and that you are able to get your apartment settled.

Also, maybe brainstorm with your neighbor about what noise cancelling they could do on their end. They shouldn\u2019t be hearing your alarm from a different apartment. You can make a furniture spray for fleas from alcohol and limonene. I bought it from Fred Meyer. Diatomaceous earth can be dusted down and then vacuumed back up, but it is a mess and I prefer to only use it outside to prevent fleas outside coming in. If you have pets get them in capstar and then a longer lasting flea treatment as well. They probably need to be bathed and flea combed as well. You have to be systematic when cleaning your place and it will probably take more than one cleaning. I successfully stopped an intense invasion when I didn\u2019t even have a washer and dryer. Had to do 13 loads of laundry one day. I found most of my rugs at Ross and tj max for great prices.

I worked in NICU and babies who are as prem as yours need breast milk to avoid a life threatening condition called NEC and a lot of Joe Public don\u2019t understand this. Also we overfeed prem babies at 150mls/kg (healthy term babies are fine on 100mls/kg) and that requirement is recalculated every weight gain so the amount of milk you need to provide is going to increase weekly to merely keep up with demand.. again people do not understand this.. breast milk is essential for preterm babies and you are NOT THE ASSHOLE as you are saving your child the risk of severe abdominal conditions by providing breast milk. The amount of mums I\u2019ve had to physically shake awake because of their exhaustion is through the roof, people do not understand the exhaustion you feel.. your neighbour should have the courtesy to suck this up for a couple of months of his life, or he should move to a building with thicker walls, what you are doing is literally life saving for a premie.. and I am not a breast is best brigade, these are EXCEPTIONAL circumstances.. 1 litre of donated breast milk costs us \u00a3100 to purchase, that\u2019s how important it is. Just to advise we recommend expressing between 2-4 in the morning as this is a natural peak time of prolactin which will increase your long term supply if you express when it\u2019s at its highest. You can also give yourself a slightly longer sleep period at night of about 5 hours, after 5 hours you get a build up of something called FIL which inhibits milk production and it is removed on expressing. Then we recommend a few cluster pumps in the day to make up for the bigger gap at night. I used to recommend last expression at 10:30pm and wake at 03:30 am to express to get that little bit of extra rest and hit that prolactin peak then express again at 0630.

He could just get some ear plugs.", "I am SO surprised by these comments. NTA - you need to feed your baby, and you can't skip a pumping session. If you can find a solution that doesn't wake him that'd be great, but I wouldn't say an alarm is excessive noise. What's he going to do when your baby comes home and cries at any hour of the night? Sorry you have to stress about this too", "NTA. It\u2019s sort of what you sign up for in apartment life.  That said you are going to be at risk for eviction if you ripped up the carpets and he starts complaining.

It might be a good solution to look into.", "NTA. There could barely a zillion reasons why you have a 1 am alarm, and ultimately it doesn't matter what they are - you're allowed to do that in your home. \"A noise woke me up once in the middle of the night\" is not sleep deprivation by Geneva Convention or any other standard, even if it happens every night.\n\nYour neighbor has options - earplugs, white noise, soundproofing in his own space. \n\nYou could also put your alarm not on the floor. Not having a mattress is one thing, do you have anything you can use as a night stand?\n\nBtw, is the NICU helping you rent a double pump? The mention of \"20 minutes on each breast\" gravely concerns me. With a premie in hospital, you need a hospital grade pump you can use at home. It won't eliminate the need for middle of the night pumping, but it will cut the time shorter for you. And help with supply.\n\nLast thing: I'm concerned about this living situation. You are bringing a baby home eventually and the air mattress is not a good thing for that. Is your landlord responsive to flea complaints? Pets have been treated? You've been treated? Basically, is this problem getting fixed or do you need to move?", "Man this sub is wild. \n\nNo. See it\u2019s a complete sentence. And it\u2019s more than alright as a reply to someone\u2019s request.  He asked her to turn off the alarm; she said no. She was polite. She offered an alternative to switch times to accommodate him.

Only AFTER he didn\u2019t accept her answer for the second time did she finally snap at him. \n\nIt\u2019s not her responsibility to make sure he sleeps. One alarm in the middle of the night is not that big of deal. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s tap dancing or moving furniture at 2am. It\u2019s one alarm. What happens when the baby comes home and she has to get up in the middle of the night? What\u2019s the neighbor going to say then? You should expect noise transfer in an apartment. One alarm isn\u2019t excessive. \n\nA baby is covered by antibodies from the mother\u2019s breast milk for the first 6 months of their life. So her doing this is important to her.  She is definitely NTA for saying no politely, being ignored, and then snapping at this man when he didn\u2019t like her answer the first time.

The guy didn't have to come rudely like that, but probably had a justification to air his concerns. My dogs wake me up at night and it IS hard to fall back asleep. Frustrating. So what to do?  Suggestions. Could you muffle the alarm?  Put it in a cushion beside you?  Turn it on vibrate?  Get a carpet remnant to put it on?  Set it on something high up or in the bathroom?

He didn't know what was going on in your life, and likewise, you don't know what's going on in his. It seems only fair to try and come up with *some* kind of compromise.
