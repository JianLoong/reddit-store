{"id": 26363, "submission_id": "16cbv4l", "title": "AITA for telling my downstairs neighbour that me expressing milk for my premmie baby will be my priority over his sleep?", "selftext": "So, my daughter was born over 3 months early. She's doing ok but she still have periods where she Bradly desats (braddies) where she stops breathing, oxygen saturation drops in her body and goes bright blue. She does this at least once a day and because of this, she is still in the NICU with no current projection for when she's coming home. The only thing I can do to help her is to give her cuddles and provide her milk, which means expressing for 20 minutes minimum on each boob every 2 to 3 hours, including over night. \n\nI have also had problems with flees in my home (they've been awful for everyone in my area this year), so I've torn up all carpets and thrown away my sofa and mattress, so I'm currently sleeping on the floor on a blow up mattress with my fianc\u00e9. This means that any noise that I make, no matter how much I try to minimise it, carries downstairs to my neighbour.\n\nI express milk over night, once at 11:30pm, 1am and then at 6:30am. My neighbour downstairs knocked on my door this morning and complained about my 1am alarm waking him up. I apologised and told him that I can't turn that specific alarm off because it's the expression that impacts my milk flow and doing that expression will prompt me to produce more milk over the day. I'm already under enough stress that my milk flow has already been impacted ( I was producing around 100ml and I'm down to 50 to 70 ml). I need the alarms because I cannot miss my expressions, I already feel guilty enough that I'm not producing as much as I was.\n\n I explained all this to him and he still said that it wakes him up and that he can't sleep after it wakes him up. I again apologised and said to him that I can set my alarm between 1am and 3:30am, and he can choose from between those times. He said I should just turn the alarm off and I responded that I can't, because I can't afford to sleep through my expressions times. He then said that I should express after 5am, which isn't possible because the hormones that help produce more milk are at their peak at between 1am and 4am. \n\nHe complained about it waking him up again and I angrily responded that \"My daughter is premature, she needs my milk and I will do everything to make sure she's got as much as she needs, including waking you up at 1am because I need to express!  She is my priority, not your sleep.\" I closed the door in his face. \n\nI just spoke to one of my friends and she's telling me that I'm the asshole because my daughter is eating every 3 hours and I'm making just enough milk every time for at least one meal for her, so \"it won't hurt to not express the 1am expression\" but it honestly IS the most important expression for milk production.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not stopping expressing at 1am even though I know it wakes up my neighbour?\n\nETA: many people have suggested I put the phone on vibrate, which would be a fantastic solution if it wasn't for the fact that I have slept straight through having injections or having a cannula put in (I was awoken long enough to give permission to have it put in). I'm open to solutions, but putting my phone on vibrate isn't going to work.\n\nEta2: I gave him noise cancelling earplugs and explained the situation when I first came home from the hospital. We also pulled up the carpets 4 days before I went into labour, so it's not something that we could control, we have to leave the flea solution to work for 2 weeks and the firm has already been booked to have new flooring put in after that 2 weeks.\n\nEta3: I've been asked to add this because it gives context to my neighbour's view regarding noise.\n\"He apparently needs absolute silence, noise or vibration doesn't seem to matter. He made a noise complaint when I moved in because I flushed my toilet at night and then again when my cat jumped down from her cat tree to get food or water at night. I've learned every squeaky floorboard in my home because if I stand on one and the squeak wakes him up, he'll scream and bang on the ceiling.\"", "created_utc": 1694081002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cbv4l/aita_for_telling_my_downstairs_neighbour_that_me/", "score": 5424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If OPs baby was home and not at the hospital, downstairs neighbour would ALSO be woken up, but in that case it would not be a simple alarm, it might be a baby crying for hours at random times!\n\nI live in an apartment where I hear the neighbours a lot, and my next door neighbour had a cholic baby a year ago - maximum of 20-30 mins without severe heartbreaking crying, all day and night, for 5 months.

Reddit truly is the land of the uncompassionate. This comment section is disgusting.", "Definitely NTA. Reading your additional comments, it sounds like this dude just doesn't like you and thats why he's having a problem with it. If he is so sensitive to sound that he wakes up when a neighbor uses the bathroom at night, he either needs to move to a building thats better sound proofed or use ear plugs to sleep.  He can't blame you for the noise if he was already waking up because of you using the bathroom before you had to replace your carpet. \n\nI recommend trying to get a rubber/foam mat to throw down in your sleeping area until you can get your fabric stuff replaced to help lessen the noise, and just set your alarm on your pillow or something like that. Maybe you could try waking up to an alarm thats flashing lights too, but I don't know how easy those are to get, or if they even have apps that will do it on your phone. But that could maybe help wake you up without noise. But if all you have is your regular alarm, that's all you can use. Its not unreasonable to hear an alarm from a neighbor in a building that isn't well soundproofed. Unfortunately thats part of most people's experience with living in a shared building. Its unreasonable to expect other people to stop existing in their own units just because the building is poorly sound proofed.\n\nI hope your baby gets better and is able to come home soon and that you are able to get your apartment settled.

Also, maybe brainstorm with your neighbor about what noise cancelling they could do on their end. They shouldn\u2019t be hearing your alarm from a different apartment. You can make a furniture spray for fleas from alcohol and limonene. I bought it from Fred Meyer. Diatomaceous earth can be dusted down and then vacuumed back up, but it is a mess and I prefer to only use it outside to prevent fleas outside coming in. If you have pets get them in capstar and then a longer lasting flea treatment as well. They probably need to be bathed and flea combed as well. You have to be systematic when cleaning your place and it will probably take more than one cleaning. I successfully stopped an intense invasion when I didn\u2019t even have a washer and dryer. Had to do 13 loads of laundry one day. I found most of my rugs at Ross and tj max for great prices.

I worked in NICU and babies who are as prem as yours need breast milk to avoid a life threatening condition called NEC and a lot of Joe Public don\u2019t understand this. Also we overfeed prem babies at 150mls/kg (healthy term babies are fine on 100mls/kg) and that requirement is recalculated every weight gain so the amount of milk you need to provide is going to increase weekly to merely keep up with demand.. again people do not understand this.. breast milk is essential for preterm babies and you are NOT THE ASSHOLE as you are saving your child the risk of severe abdominal conditions by providing breast milk. The amount of mums I\u2019ve had to physically shake awake because of their exhaustion is through the roof, people do not understand the exhaustion you feel.. your neighbour should have the courtesy to suck this up for a couple of months of his life, or he should move to a building with thicker walls, what you are doing is literally life saving for a premie.. and I am not a breast is best brigade, these are EXCEPTIONAL circumstances.. 1 litre of donated breast milk costs us \u00a3100 to purchase, that\u2019s how important it is. Just to advise we recommend expressing between 2-4 in the morning as this is a natural peak time of prolactin which will increase your long term supply if you express when it\u2019s at its highest. You can also give yourself a slightly longer sleep period at night of about 5 hours, after 5 hours you get a build up of something called FIL which inhibits milk production and it is removed on expressing. Then we recommend a few cluster pumps in the day to make up for the bigger gap at night. I used to recommend last expression at 10:30pm and wake at 03:30 am to express to get that little bit of extra rest and hit that prolactin peak then express again at 0630.

How is setting an alarm when you need to get up to do something a problem?  If they worked at night and had to get up for work, are they supposed to not set an alarm? This is idiotic. It doesn't matter why she needs up at that time. She does. So she set an alarm. The neighbor is being ridiculous, and it will only get worse when the baby comes home.", "I know this is nuts, and of course you don\u2019t have to do it, but have you thought about just moving your air mattress into the living room temporarily? Of course you\u2019re NTA, and I wore ear plugs and had a white noise machine when I lived in apartments because other people exists.", "Why can't the neighbor put on headphones? Sleep is obviously a pillar of health, but this won't be forever.", "It's an alarm. It's not like you are blasting loud music. He could just get some ear plugs.", "I am SO surprised by these comments. NTA - you need to feed your baby, and you can't skip a pumping session. If you can find a solution that doesn't wake him that'd be great, but I wouldn't say an alarm is excessive noise. What's he going to do when your baby comes home and cries at any hour of the night? Sorry you have to stress about this too", "NTA. It\u2019s sort of what you sign up for in apartment life.  That said you are going to be at risk for eviction if you ripped up the carpets and he starts complaining. The noise has probably jumped a large degree because of that. \n\nSo while NTA you might be putting yourself in a bigger risk solution. \n\nThey make vibrating watches designed for people who sleep through alarms. It might be a good solution to look into.", "NTA. There could barely a zillion reasons why you have a 1 am alarm, and ultimately it doesn't matter what they are - you're allowed to do that in your home. \"A noise woke me up once in the middle of the night\" is not sleep deprivation by Geneva Convention or any other standard, even if it happens every night.\n\nYour neighbor has options - earplugs, white noise, soundproofing in his own space. \n\nYou could also put your alarm not on the floor. Not having a mattress is one thing, do you have anything you can use as a night stand?\n\nBtw, is the NICU helping you rent a double pump? The mention of \"20 minutes on each breast\" gravely concerns me. With a premie in hospital, you need a hospital grade pump you can use at home. It won't eliminate the need for middle of the night pumping, but it will cut the time shorter for you. And help with supply.\n\nLast thing: I'm concerned about this living situation. You are bringing a baby home eventually and the air mattress is not a good thing for that. Is your landlord responsive to flea complaints? Pets have been treated? You've been treated? Basically, is this problem getting fixed or do you need to move?", "Man this sub is wild. \n\nNo. See it\u2019s a complete sentence. And it\u2019s more than alright as a reply to someone\u2019s request.  He asked her to turn off the alarm; she said no. She was polite. She offered an alternative to switch times to accommodate him. He wants it off completely. And she said \u201cno\u201d again. Only AFTER he didn\u2019t accept her answer for the second time did she finally snap at him. \n\nIt\u2019s not her responsibility to make sure he sleeps. One alarm in the middle of the night is not that big of deal. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s tap dancing or moving furniture at 2am. It\u2019s one alarm. What happens when the baby comes home and she has to get up in the middle of the night? What\u2019s the neighbor going to say then? You should expect noise transfer in an apartment. One alarm isn\u2019t excessive. \n\nA baby is covered by antibodies from the mother\u2019s breast milk for the first 6 months of their life. So her doing this is important to her.  She is definitely NTA for saying no politely, being ignored, and then snapping at this man when he didn\u2019t like her answer the first time.  If this was anywhere else y\u2019all would be saying NTA. He can get some damn ear plugs.", "You are NTA and fuck anyone here who tells you otherwise.", "NTA I\u2019m actually surprised this is so polarized. What if you were getting up to go to work at that time? The baby will most definitely cry at inopportune times. Tell him to get a fan or something for white noise.", "NTA. Pumping milk in your own home whenever you please is completely reasonable and medically necessary for your baby. He\u2019s in for a wide awakening when the baby comes home if he thinks this is bad.

The guy didn't have to come rudely like that, but probably had a justification to air his concerns. My dogs wake me up at night and it IS hard to fall back asleep. Frustrating. So what to do?  Suggestions. Could you muffle the alarm?  Put it in a cushion beside you?  Turn it on vibrate?  Get a carpet remnant to put it on?  Set it on something high up or in the bathroom?  I had neighbors gripe we were too noisy when my son was tiny. It pretty much irked me since babies make noises, point being it just ticks the stuffing out of you when life is noisy and some grumpy goat complains. Apartments can be frustrating, so many people so close together.", "Of course you are NTA, and I hope you already know this. You have to express your milk. Period. End of discussion. It sounds like your landlord has responsibilities here that need to be addressed more than you. If you can find ways to wake up reliably with a quieter alarm, dampen the sound from the floor, etc. then great. If not I would feel sorry for your downstairs neighbor but what are you supposed to do?  But your neighbor a set of ear plugs?  Maybe that would help. I don\u2019t know. Keep doing what you need to be doing and don\u2019t seat it.", "NTA - I strongly disagree with all those saying YTA. The baby has a right to food.

I'm also a mom though, so. Maybe this is a lesson in being more understanding all around, because anyone can be going through it, unbeknownst to the random passerby. He didn't know what was going on in your life, and likewise, you don't know what's going on in his. It seems only fair to try and come up with *some* kind of compromise.

I've lived in apartments my whole life til I bought my house and there was always something going on that impacts your neighbor, it just happens when you're so close to eachother.

In the meantime, get your neighbor some earplugs and deliver them with some cookies and an apology note. Maybe even throw in a white noise machine for him.\n\nI\u2019ll also add that I had a very similar pump schedule as you when my daughter was born. 1) the vibrate alarm definitely would NOT have worked for me bc I was so sleep deprived I would have slept thru it. 2) Have you spoken with a lactation consultant? Mine told me to sleep between midnight and 5am because that would increase milk production. She said if my body isn\u2019t getting enough sleep it will go into survival mode and stop making milk.

I've met women (including me) having a hysterical meltdown in the pump room because their baby is eating 15 mls every 2 hours and they're only producing 18 mls, and they're desperately trying to increase production so they can keep up because it's *the only thing* that we can do to help our babies.

It's a temporary situation, she's already gifted him noise cancelling equipment, and the guy complained because she flushed a toilet once.

Move!\n\nNo offense intended, but it sounds like you're trying to find a reason for your neighbor to be at fault in all this. Most multi-floored buildings have fairly decent construction between floors to support one person living atop another.

If his bedroom is on the right side of his apartment, why don't you sleep on the left side of yours during this time so as not to disturb his sleep.", "Doesn\u2019t help that OP went all crackhead status and pulled the carpet up and is sleeping on what I assume is plywood floor.

Fuck that guy. Apartment living comes with some periods of noise. He\u2019ll live.", "This is why I'm kinda amazed at the amount of YTA responses.

Where I live now my upstairs neighbor has a dog, I can hear the nails on the floor clacking sometimes of her dog. Can also hear them laugh happily through the vents sometimes, and that's just the life of living stacked on top of each other. \n\nIt's one thing to purposely be an ass to a neighbor with noise, but this isn't it.", "Literally putting your phone between your pillow and mattress is the answer.

You're doing the right things, your body is working well. The baby will put different demands on your milk than the pump can at this stage, so don't worry too much about the \"decrease\"  in volume. She will only consume a tiny amount of that in her feeds, and you will keep making more!

But right now that is not possible.", "Has he never heard of earplugs?", "I absolutely agree with you. I remember one time I lived in a complex where the laundry room was connected to the wall of a tenant's condo. Even having the slightest conversation in there would result in her rushing in and screaming about how you were keeping her up (she was a nurse that worked at night). She was the one that choose that unit, nobody forced her into it. Same with this downstairs neighbor. Don't like living downstairs from someone? Then don't pick a downstairs unit.", "Agreed. Getting rid of the carpet and furniture wasn\u2019t a home decor choice, it was an unfortunate necessity. Maybe she can\u2019t afford a special quiet, vibrating alarm right now between the hospital bills and needing to replace furniture. All of her mental energy is going towards her baby\u2019s health and survival. The neighbor is a grown man who can problem solve on his own. He can try sleeping in another room that isn\u2019t directly under OP, and ear plugs are cheap and easy to find. OP even said she had given some to him preemptively, so it\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t shown any consideration. He\u2019s just unwilling to use them. \n\nNTA. She\u2019s allowed to be selfish in this moment and focus on her baby\u2019s health. It\u2019s temporary. The carpet will be replaced soon enough.

Totally agree. I think people claiming YTA don't have extensive apartment experience.

The neighbor can get his own house or wear ear plugs.", "All these people acting like an alarm going of is an airhorn in the neighbors ear. 'He has the right to a peaceful home'. Okay? OP can also use her home how she wants as well? She tried the vibrating alarm (which I use), but it doesn't work for her. He's living in a place with shared walls, so he can't control when other people need to come and go, when they need to wake up for work, or use the bathroom. If he can't handle living where he has to hear other people at night, then that's something that he will have to figure out. \n\nHer baby is her priority and she's doing what she was probably told to. His sleep is his priority and his problem to figure out. The carpet will be back soon, so the supposed magic noise cancelation that is going to help him sleep like a fairytale princess through the night will be back in place. Everyone is rightfully worried about his sleep deprivation, but his inability to go back to sleep is really not something she needs to dance around either. OP is also losing sleep, and she tried to give him a heads up and headphones to cancel the noise. That's 1000% more consideration than I would have given my neighbors if I was going through the same thing as OP. They wouldn't even be on my radar. I've lived with noisy neighbors in the past; I wouldn't even consider her nighttime routine a minor distrubance comparatively. \n\nI also can't get over the fact that he is trying to dictate her lactation. That conversation would have ended before it began if it were me.", "The neighbour is a light sleeper and has no idea that things are about to get much MUCH louder for him when baby comes home.\n\nFor your sanity, I sincerely hope he doesn\u2019t knock on your door in the middle of the night due to a crying baby.", "That's what I was thinking, when the baby is home it's be them crying not the alarm so won't it be the same?? He'll complain about that too so there's no point stopping the alarm now.", "She says carpet is being replaced in 2 weeks.", "The flooring was removed for flea treatment before the baby was born\u2026 prematurely. How is this her fault? Lol", "You can even just get a piece of noise absorbent material that the alarm clock can be set on, so that \\*some\\* of the sound gets absorbed (and only sound that bounces off the walls/ceilings goes downstairs).  And/or an alarm clock that has better volume control on it, so you can set it just loud enough to wake you up.\n\nPlus, \"my hormones for expressing are best at that time\" is a little ridiculous.  If you're lactating, and you collect milk frequently, your body will keep producing it.  You don't HAVE to do it at exactly that 2 hour window.  His request for 5am is reasonable.\n\nIf you firmly believe that 1-3 am is a requirement, then it is up to you (OP) to manage that schedule without disrupting your neighbor(s).\n\nYTA", "She can make efforts to reduce the neighbor waking up to the alarm like others have mentioned (ie. Vibrating or visual alarm).\n\nWhen the baby comes she should make whatever efforts she can to soundproof (ie. Proper carpeting, maybe a rug on top of the carpet, heavy curtains, or other sound dampening materials, etc) and try to position the baby as far away in the apartment from the neighbors bedroom if possible.\n\nI have two kids, two dogs, and at one point we had a parakeet as well. We made the choice to have kids and have pets, not my neighbors. The respectful thing is to do whatever we can to make sure they don't disturb our neighbors. Anything else is a really good way to make your neighbors hate you, as well as dogs and kids in general. \n\nWe introduced ourselves to our neighbors when we first moved in and any time there's some extra noise we can't control (ie. Baby had a cold, nieces/nephews visited, inlaws brought their dog etc.) we would bring over some cookies/muffins or a nice premade dish to apologize.\n\nOP chose to have a baby.Throwing a fit and telling the neighbor to just \"deal with it\" instead of being respectful and empathetic to his situation (especially when he had no part in OPs choice to have a baby) is honestly childish and an overly entitled attitude.

OP should be doing whatever she can to minimize noise and it honestly wouldn't hurt to bring him some cookies or something...", "She needs to replace the insulation that the carpet she ripped out provided.

I can literally hear my neighbor\u2019s phone vibrate when it\u2019s on a desk or table. I can also hear him go pee. Expecting your neighbor to stop using their phone alarm is wild. All the YTA comments that say OP should adjust their phone alarm to accommodate her neighbor is just wild.", "> Even WITH carpet hearing our upstairs, downstairs, and next door neighbors cooking, cleaning, fighting, laughing etc was normal. \n\nExcept in almost all of these normal situations these things are not happening every night at 1:00 - 3:00AM. In any of these situations if your neighbor was cooking, cleaning, fighting laughing etc every night at 1:00am and waking people up it would be a huge problem.   \n\nIf you know you have a schedule that is not normal and you are keeping your neighbors from sleeping why not wear headphones?? Why purposely be an asshole?", "If your alarm is loud enough to wake up a downstairs or upstairs neighbor, it's way too fucking loud and totally unreasonable. No alarm needs to be that loud unless you have measurable hearing loss. And if that's the case, guess what, it's on you to find a way to use an alarm that doesn't have the volume of an air horn. I've lived in very thin walled apartments. A neighbor on the same floor could be clearly heard talking on the phone at a normal volume. But guess what? This isn't coming through the walls, it's through the floor. And it's not just 'able to hear it clearly'. It's 'loud enough to wake him up'. It doesn't matter if it only goes off for a few seconds. Last I checked being woken up isn't dependent on how long the alarm is. \n\nAt the end of the day, OP definitely gets YTA for not even considering her neighbors ability to sleep. Zero effort to accommodate neighbors in a thin walled apartment is an automatic YTA, in pretty much every scenario. Sometimes nothing can be done, but not even trying or thinking about it is not the same.", "...also OP should go with what her DOCTORS HAVE TOLD HER rather than a random redditor telling her she's wrong", "Op removed anything that might absorb sound, this issue was created by op.", "Her alarm is going off three times each night in an apartment with no sound dampening, *in addition* to whatever alarms OP and her partner have set to wake up in the morning.
