My MIL has been treating my oldest son(12) who isn\u2019t by her son, completely different then my middle son (5) and my daughter(2). I had to work late one Friday and my husband needed to go into work. He asked if it was ok for his mother to watch the kids, the oldest included. She normally wouldn\u2019t take him when he would ask to spend the night with his younger brother, she flat out says no, you\u2019re too much for me. I made comments in the past that if he can\u2019t be treated the same as the other two, then none of them needed to go. She reluctantly said yes he could come over as long as he behaved appropriately for his age. Mind you, he has ADHD and some sensory issues. Anyways half way through my shift I get a text from the oldest, saying MIL is letting the 5yo watch some YouTube video h*tting babies in the face. I absolutely don\u2019t allow YouTube in my house for the younger kids and MIL has been told several times about this. Anyways I text my husband and tell him what\u2019s going on, my oldest then text me saying MIL is telling 5yo to call him stupid and to shut up it\u2019s none of his business. I then text my husband again what\u2019s going on. I received one more text and what\u2019s being said to my oldest, so I leave work immediately. I go to pick all my kids up and MIL immediately states my husband has never told her about YouTube and what he can\u2019t watch. I simply said, you have been told once before by both of us and I have the text to prove it. She then tells my oldest he needed to Stfu because all he did was create problems. I told my son to a step outside and I\u2019ll be out in a minute. I got her side of the story and said my husband will talk to you and walked out. I just walked out. I got my sons side of the story and decided enough was enough and I didn\u2019t want any of the kids there unsupervised meaning my husband would have to stay there because I want nothing to do with them anymore. My son and I have always been singled out since I got with my husband nine years ago. I no longer want to go over there and I don\u2019t want them at the house. Three weeks have gone by and just yesterday my husbands step father showed up to speak to him. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m to blame for all of this and keeping the kids from them. But my husband agreed enough was enough he just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it at the moment because he\u2019s still angry with MIL and all she does is argues and point the finger at me and the oldest causing issues.

It\u2019s pathetic.", "NTA you are protecting your children \n\nYour MIL is trouble. I\u2019m glad your husband is on board with you and not taking his toxic parents side on this.", "NTA- you handled this 100% better than I would\u2019ve cause I would\u2019ve let her have it. She is cruel and she is the one that is causing problems. Not your son. She knew she wasn\u2019t suppose to do that, and she tried to blame it on the boy. See you soon on r/JUSTNOMIL", "NTA 100%.

She has no sense of self awareness.", "nta, you handled it way better than i would", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying ESH. Your MIL is ignoring rules you have set in place for your kids, which is not ok. But really, it\u2019s not like she is putting your kids in danger, I think leaving work to rush over there and get them bcuz they were watching YouTube and then not allowing her to see the kids anymore is a bit extreme. Keep in mind that you are not just hurting her by doing this, you are also hurting your kids, who probably are too young to really understand the situation and just miss grandma. Also you weren\u2019t there and you are getting secondhand information from a 12 yr old, that possibly could have been a bit exaggerated since the kid did seem to jump on the chance to rat out grandma. Which is probably one of the reasons that they don\u2019t have a good relationship, I\u2019m sure grandma was raised to not tattle unless someone is getting hurt. So I can see why you are upset, and I can see why grandma is upset too, but I think keeping your kids from their grandparents that they love is a bit harsh. Maybe do supervised visits until you feel more comfortable and sit down with grandma and show her the things your kids are able to access online and offer to send your own tablet with parental controls when your kids go there.", "YTA...As i read this I feel you are super controlling...it makes me feel like your version isnt quite credible. You trained your eldest to nark on his step grandma if his sib\u00f1ings are watching youtube videos. \n\nI kinda agree, you guys both are looking to cause problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good boundaries are important with MILs like this.", "Hitting babies in the face? This is a thing?", "NTA\n\nA 5 year old has no business watching YouTube or any other videos unless directly supervised.  There are plenty of things safe for a young child, and plenty of stuff not safe.", "[deleted]", "NTA, that is abuse plan and simple. Do not let your kids near her.

DO NOT LEAVE YOUR KIDS WITH HER.", "Nta", "It\u2019s disgusting honestly.", "She\u2019s very cruel. I didn\u2019t always walk away like that, my husband has gotten in between a few times.

She\u2019s the one not acting her age.", "It wasn\u2019t always like that. Just arguing with them is absolutely pointless because it will always be anyone but them.", "Oh no she told him the Stfu to him when I showed up. She said it in front of me. She also doesn\u2019t allow the 12 year old to call her grandma. I didn\u2019t say they couldn\u2019t go over there. I said they can go over there supervised with their father. Because this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. My 5year old has told me she says things about the oldest all the time. We have gone over this many times with her before. I rushed over from work because of the text messages I was getting from my son. He was being called names and the adults was encouraging the behavior. Once again this has been an on going problem with the MIL. My husband is welcomed to take the kids there with him. Not completely withholding them, I guess I phrased it wrong.", "Well considering my husband agrees with me, I guess he\u2019s controlling also. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Apparently, there\u2019s some YouTube channel showing it. My oldest pulled it up once we got home and it was pretty much a grown man talking about doing it.", "My husband is on board which I stated towards the end of my post. And the oldest is not his son which is why I refer to him as my son.", "Exactly. A grown woman treating a 12 year old child like a second class citizen, and going so far as to recruit his 5 year old brother to act out against him. She needs to be kept away from the children until she can act like a decent adult.", "Sounds like it\u2019s just been an all around lousy situation for a long time, that must be hard to cope with on a regular basis since it\u2019s so ongoing. Regardless of how she feels about your son she should not be calling him names, he\u2019s a child, that\u2019s insane. And I\u2019m sure he feels the tension around her and it affects his behavior because he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable and loved with her. Maybe only let your little kids go over there with their dad and keep your oldest with you and just have some special mom and son time with him while they are there so that instead of feeling left out he feels like he\u2019s getting the better deal. I know it\u2019s total bs that she treats him as an outsider, but I doubt she is ever going to change based on how you describe her, probably better just to not subject your son to her behavior. You swayed me, I change my vote, NTA.", "or... you bewitched him and control him with your pinky..... best case scenareo is I am absolutly wrong...seems weird though...spidey senses be tingling", "Understood. My comment is retracted and you are NTA.", "Never thought about it that way. Maybe I\u2019ll just make him go no contact with her since I\u2019m so controlling. Maybe it was why his brother doesn\u2019t contact her either. His wife is controlling him also with her pinky. We banned together to exclude her from everything."]}
