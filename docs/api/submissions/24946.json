Recently my girlfriend has taken to wearing my boxers and underwear. Not shirts or shorts, stuff like that. Just my underwear. She says they're comfy and likes how they feel. I bought her some of the kinds I always get but she won't wear those ones, she wants mine for whatever reason.\n\nIt was cute when it first started but she changes clothes twice a day so that's 3 pair of underoos coming out of my drawer daily. I've asked her to stop, I've told her to stop. She won't stop and thinks I'm getting upset over nothing because, as she states, none of her previous relationships had a problem with her taking their clothes.\n\nI put a lock on my underwear drawer. It's just a safety lock but I won't tell her how to open it and she got frustrated when she couldn't get it open. Apparently, she told her best friend about it because when I got home last night, her friend commented that only an ass would do something like that. I get what they're saying about it being clothes but I think it's a pretty simple ask to not do it daily because that adds up quickly.\n\nThe 3 pairs a day seem to be causing some confusion- She wears 2 pairs (wear to work and another pair she puts on after she gets home from work and showers) and then I take a pair to wear for the day.\n\nRequested info: There are 3 reasons I don't like sharing my underwear: 1. I just don't like sharing underwear, it's gross to me and a hard 'no'. She's been told this every time I bring the topic up. 2. Her wearing them stretches them out and puts extra wear and tear in addition to what constant washing does. 3. Not to be gross or judgy but vaginas have all kinds of discharge and I don't want stained undies.\n\nWho does the laundry and how often: We have to use a laundromat, meaning laundry gets done 1, sometimes 2, days a week. We share the laundry duty. Either we both go or one of us does it one week, and the next week the other person does it.

You made a reasonable compromise in buying her more underwear to supplement what she takes from your stash. But it would have also been helpful to discuss why she feels it so critical to wear your specific underwear\u2014 \n\nDoes she feel closer to you? Does it make her feel naughty? Is it a control issue? \n\nIf she\u2019d actually been willing to discuss it and a possible compromise (like 1 pair per day), you would not have had to secure your belongings. Not only was she dismissive of your feelings on the issue, she doubled down by saying it\u2019s a nonissue because her past boyfriends didn\u2019t mind her behavior. Then when you lock your belongings, she tells a friend who calls you a jerk. *Why do her exes and friends have more sway in this relationship than you?*\n\nIf you guys are going to battle over underwear, I can\u2019t imagine how you will troubleshoot larger issues.

Wtf for?", "NTA if you can afford it buy yourself all new ones and give her your old ones tell her she is free to use those but she needs to stop taking yours as it's causing you to run out of clean clothes faster.

But if she's doing the laundry every couple of days and you have plenty, to me, it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nETA: she's definitely an a-hole for comparing you (unfavorably) to past boyfriends.", "NTA. She won't respect your boundaries so you've made them stronger (with a lock). As a compromise though, could you set aside a few pairs of your underwear and designate them as her own personal stockpile? Like take 5-6 pairs, put them in a different drawer, and tell her to have at it? Then she can be responsible for washing and returning them when she's done and the rest of your undies will remain untouched at your disposal.\n\nP.S. FWIW, I do think her desire to wear your clothes is endearing as it's likely a way for her to feel closer to you. I'd think of a way to talk this out with her & find a solution that works for you both so you can adios the lock, which doesn't seem like a healthy or long-term solution.", "Caught between NTA because you did ask her to stop, and NAH because it does sound like an innocent quirk you are getting worked up over. Have you spoken with her more about why she likes YOUR underwear so much? Especially since you bought her some for herself. Maybe she feels more connected to you by wearing them. Maybe the best solution is to buy more underwear for yourself. Or keep a stash for yourself somewhere to make sure you always have some on hand.", "ESH.

Maybe you hit a point in your relationship that she feels like this is the next step for her.\n\nWhat I can say is that the lock is only only going to cause new issues. You two are going to have to talk this out more. And you have to ask yourself if this is something you can overlook or if it's too much. You did put some boundaries out, and she didn't respect them.

If my girl asks for my clothing I\u2019m giving it to her even if it\u2019s off my back, I got enough clothes\u2026", "Give her your old ones and take the new ones for yourself. Used boxers are just more comfortable for stealing.", "NTA Get a secret underwear drawer. Go buy new ones and put them in that drawer and let her have the ones she already wore. This way you always have a stash of clean ones.", "Maybe if she doesn't stop just have only 3 in the drawer and hid the in weird spots only u would know like under mattress and or something", "If your gf is \u201cstretching out\u201d your drawers by wearing them: you the gf.", "YTA just leave instead of being so weird about it", "Girlfriend is a whole marinara flag", "I wish more people had this attitude.  My friends repeated told me stuff like this is fine and said i uad stupud boundaries. ..", "YWBTA = you WOULD be the asshole", "The only time a thong was ever comfortable was when I wore tight jeans.  The jeans just \"hugged\" my butt in such a way that I really didn't notice/feel the thong.  Some sorta witchcraft I guess. \nNow in regular non tight clothing even leggings, a thong would just be unbearable.\nI do not recommend. \nI choose comfort and lowering my risk of a yeast infection over any asthetic.", "When I first wore thong underwear, it felt weird. Then I wore them for decades after, and couldn't wear undies that gave more 'coverage'. It's surprising how a small garment like that can feel weird or uncomfy, depending on the person!", "Fair enough. She needs to stop, full stop.", "Nah, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to point out common sense. You know who we don\u2019t need to point out who can\u2019t vaccinate? Those allergic, cause no shit. I say this as someone who\u2019s spend the majority of the past week in shower with horrible pain."]}
