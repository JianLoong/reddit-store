If she keeps at it just start wearing three pairs of hers daily. And when she offers to buy you your own in the same style tell her you want hers. Take the cute ones, the granny panties, take them all.", "If you need to lock up your clothes because your GF refused your simple request to stop wearing them, you don\u2019t need a lock, you need a new GF.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to respect your property and boundaries. Shouldn't have had to ask more than once for her to stop taking your shit.", "NTA\n\n> I've asked her to stop, I've told her to stop. She won't stop and thinks I'm getting upset over nothing because, as she states, none of her previous relationships had a problem with her taking their clothes.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really about the clothes. You made a reasonable compromise in buying her more underwear to supplement what she take from your stash, but it would have been helpful to also discuss why she feels it so critical to wear your specific underwear\u2014 \n\nDoes she feel closer to you? Does it make her feel naughty? Is it a control issue? \n\nIf she\u2019d actually been willing to discuss it and a possible compromise (like 1 pair per day), you would not have had to secure your belongings. Not only was she dismissive of your feelings on the issue, she doubled down by saying it\u2019s a nonissue *because her past boyfriends didn\u2019t mind her behavior*. Then when you lock your belongings, she tells a friend who calls you a jerk. Why do her exes and friends have more sway in this relationship than you?\n\nIf you guys are going to battle over underwear, I can\u2019t imagine how you will troubleshoot larger issues. It\u2019s also a huge turn-off if a partner justifies trampling over your boundaries by saying \u201cyou can\u2019t have that boundary b/c my exes didn\u2019t\u201d.", "NTA, however: if you have to lock your belongings away from a significant other, because they don't respect your boundaries, YWBTA for not questioning this relationship entirely. You don't want her to do this with your underwear, so if you're not okay with this (possible kink) and she's not buying you extras to make up for how much she uses, then perhaps breaking up would not be assholish either.", "Changes clothes twice a day? Wtf for?", "NTA if you can afford it buy yourself all new ones and give her your old ones tell her she is free to use those but she needs to stop taking yours as it's causing you to run out of clean clothes faster. Also it doesn't seem like she's even washing them for you so if she doesn't want your old ones you can also just tell her if she wants to borrow them she has to do the laundry, just the underwear not all your laundry, and let her know those are her two options if she wants to continue to use them.", "NTA. This is about personal space and boundaries, which clearly she doesn't respect.", "NTA.  Start wearing her panties.  Claim it is \"strictly a comfort thing.\"", "How in tf are you an ass!?!?!? These are YOUR underwear and she needs to respect and accept when you told her to stop she clearly doesn\u2019t not respect you she\u2019s too old to be acting like this she needs to buy her own NTA", "NTA- doesnt matter the reason, she has been asked to stop and wont.  I find that some gfs take clothing to purely brag to their friends about it, and this seems to be the case. You bought her the same kind you wear and she still takes yours, thats not them 'feeling nice' thats taking your stuff and not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA\n\nEspecially if she isn't washing, folding, and putting them back. She can buy boxers or boy shorts.", "I have mixed feelings. I've been married for 20 years. I still love to put on one of his shirts *every once in a while*. They are comfy and smell like him. My question would be, who's doing the laundry, and how often? If you're running out of underwear and doing your own laundry, I would definitely say NTA. But if she's doing the laundry every couple of days and you have plenty, to me, it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nETA: she's definitely an a-hole for comparing you (unfavorably) to past boyfriends.", "NTA. She won't respect your boundaries so you've made them stronger (with a lock). As a compromise though, could you set aside a few pairs of your underwear and designate them as her own personal stockpile? Like take 5-6 pairs, put them in a different drawer, and tell her to have at it? Then she can be responsible for washing and returning them when she's done and the rest of your undies will remain untouched at your disposal.\n\nP.S. FWIW, I do think her desire to wear your clothes is endearing as it's likely a way for her to feel closer to you. I'd think of a way to talk this out with her & find a solution that works for you both so you can adios the lock, which doesn't seem like a healthy or long-term solution.", "Caught between NTA because you did ask her to stop, and NAH because it does sound like an innocent quirk you are getting worked up over. Have you spoken with her more about why she likes YOUR underwear so much? Especially since you bought her some for herself. Maybe she feels more connected to you by wearing them. Maybe the best solution is to buy more underwear for yourself. Or keep a stash for yourself somewhere to make sure you always have some on hand.", "ESH. Your girlfriend should have more respect for your property, but putting a lock on the drawer is patronising. You are both adults. She is not a child stealing candy. This is very much something you can talk out.", "Esh\n\nThis is not the way to live together", "YTA. She wants to wear YOU, idiot.", "ESH. Instead of healthy communication this is passive aggressive and solves nothing. She needs to respect your boundaries. You need to have actual communication instead of treating her like a 6 year old. If neither of this can happen you need to break up.", "For the price of a lock you could have just bought her some of her own.", "INFO:\nI do laundry every other day. Even if my GF took 2 of my underwear a day, I'd never run out of them. So what is the actual problem that gets you annoyed? This all seems very petty to me.", "Just buy more new underwear?  Putting a lock on a dresser is pretty extreme; what\u2019s wrong with wearing new underwear for yourself?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like you have tried to communicate and that didn't work. Tried buying her her own, that didn't work. Now it's time to just MAKE the behavior stop. It also sounds to me like this isn't the only boundary she crosses.", "NTA.  She is using your clothes after being asked and then told to stop.  You bought her some for her to wear.

She should respect your personal space and belongings. This doesnt bode well for the relationship.", "This is all very weird. It's probably not worth escalating further than this, but I would say that putting a lock on your underwear drawer is not an asshole move so far.", "...and you're with her, why?", "NTA. I get it. I enjoy wearing items of my partners clothing sometimes. A larger shirt to sleep in, or a comfy hoodie at home. I swear men's clothes can be a lot more comfortable than women's. It also makes me feel better and kind of more protected at times or closer to him.\n\nWhile I wouldn't wear his underwear that's a new one for me. I also don't use my partners clothes at the frequency your partner does. But, if my partner ever asked me to stop I would immediately stop and ask why he didn't like it so I could understand better and then accept his answer.\n\nIt may seem like a small thing. But, the fact that you've expressed something bothers you and your girlfriend ignores that and still does what makes you uncomfortable is not a good sign I'm sorry to say.", "NTA Why do I feel like this is some kind of BS TikTok inspired loyalty test?", "NTA. Why are you with this disrespectful person?", "Is this some sort of kink for her?\n\nI agree with others that the iranian yogurt is not the issue here.\n\nShe's stomping on your boundaries, when you provided an acceptable compromise of buying her some of the underwear that you use.\n\nI don't think it's a reasonable relationship expectation to share underwear.

If she wants to take your clothes this much she can wear the ones you got her or do the laundry.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, there is a bigger issue here with her not respecting your wishes. Best solution may be to lose the gf.\n\nIf you want to keep the gf, then my solution is to steal some money from her purse to buy like 10 extra packs of your underwear. Stuff em in your dresser and then she can wear all she wants and you shouldn\u2019t run out.", "Honestly NTA but maybe you could have found a better way to handle your grievance.", "NTA, but, if you want to continue the relationship, why not put all the new underwear in the drawer(s) with the older pairs? Buy enough for both of you for two weeks or however many you need between laundry days? I know it seems expensive but if you want the relationship, it might be worth it. She can keep taking yours and you don\u2019t run out. Seems like its the same as you buying for her.

She is not being respectful of your thoughts and wishes when they conflict with hers. That's not the kind of thing you should look for in a partner...", "I can only speculate as to her motivations. Maybe you hit a point in your relationship that she feels like this is the next step for her.\n\nWhat I can say is that the lock is only only going to cause new issues. You two are going to have to talk this out more. And you have to ask yourself if this is something you can overlook or if it's too much. You did put some boundaries out, and she didn't respect them. So it's understandable why you are frustrated. Maybe you two can find a compromise like her limiting it to 1 pair a day.", "Then this relationship has bigger problems. But putting a lock on your drawer solves nothing. Personally if he's asked her numerous times to do something and she completely ignores it than he would be better off breaking it off than this passive aggressive crap.", "If you can't trust your girlfriend to remotely listen to you and need to lock your drawers you should break up with your girlfriend", "Staying with someone you consider the same as a 6 year old is not a solution.", "I did mention that *all* of it seems very petty, both sides. I was digging for the deeper reason, and we got a clarification. It's a hygiene issue to OP. Not gonna judge that.", "When I used to work in my office when I came home I would change from my business casual to shorts and a shirt.
