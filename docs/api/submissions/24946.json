Recently my girlfriend has taken to wearing my boxers and underwear. Not shirts or shorts, stuff like that. Just my underwear. She says they're comfy and likes how they feel. I bought her some of the kinds I always get but she won't wear those ones, she wants mine for whatever reason.\n\nIt was cute when it first started but she changes clothes twice a day so that's 3 pair of underoos coming out of my drawer daily. I've asked her to stop, I've told her to stop. She won't stop and thinks I'm getting upset over nothing because, as she states, none of her previous relationships had a problem with her taking their clothes.\n\nI put a lock on my underwear drawer. It's just a safety lock but I won't tell her how to open it and she got frustrated when she couldn't get it open. Apparently, she told her best friend about it because when I got home last night, her friend commented that only an ass would do something like that. I get what they're saying about it being clothes but I think it's a pretty simple ask to not do it daily because that adds up quickly.\n\nThe 3 pairs a day seem to be causing some confusion- She wears 2 pairs (wear to work and another pair she puts on after she gets home from work and showers) and then I take a pair to wear for the day.\n\nRequested info: There are 3 reasons I don't like sharing my underwear: 1. I just don't like sharing underwear, it's gross to me and a hard 'no'. She's been told this every time I bring the topic up. 2. Her wearing them stretches them out and puts extra wear and tear in addition to what constant washing does. 3. Not to be gross or judgy but vaginas have all kinds of discharge and I don't want stained undies.\n\nWho does the laundry and how often: We have to use a laundromat, meaning laundry gets done 1, sometimes 2, days a week. We share the laundry duty. Either we both go or one of us does it one week, and the next week the other person does it.

You made a reasonable compromise in buying her more underwear to supplement what she take from your stash, but it would have been helpful to also discuss why she feels it so critical to wear your specific underwear\u2014 \n\nDoes she feel closer to you? Does it make her feel naughty? Is it a control issue? \n\nIf she\u2019d actually been willing to discuss it and a possible compromise (like 1 pair per day), you would not have had to secure your belongings. Not only was she dismissive of your feelings on the issue, she doubled down by saying it\u2019s a nonissue because her past boyfriends didn\u2019t mind her behavior. Then when you lock your belongings, she tells a friend who calls you a jerk. *Why do her exes and friends have more sway in this relationship than you?*\n\nIf you guys are going to battle over underwear, I can\u2019t imagine how you will troubleshoot larger issues.

But if she's doing the laundry every couple of days and you have plenty, to me, it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nETA: she's definitely an a-hole for comparing you (unfavorably) to past boyfriends.", "NTA. She won't respect your boundaries so you've made them stronger (with a lock). As a compromise though, could you set aside a few pairs of your underwear and designate them as her own personal stockpile? Like take 5-6 pairs, put them in a different drawer, and tell her to have at it? Then she can be responsible for washing and returning them when she's done and the rest of your undies will remain untouched at your disposal.\n\nP.S. FWIW, I do think her desire to wear your clothes is endearing as it's likely a way for her to feel closer to you. I'd think of a way to talk this out with her & find a solution that works for you both so you can adios the lock, which doesn't seem like a healthy or long-term solution.", "Caught between NTA because you did ask her to stop, and NAH because it does sound like an innocent quirk you are getting worked up over. Have you spoken with her more about why she likes YOUR underwear so much? Especially since you bought her some for herself. Maybe she feels more connected to you by wearing them. Maybe the best solution is to buy more underwear for yourself. Or keep a stash for yourself somewhere to make sure you always have some on hand.", "ESH.

Maybe you hit a point in your relationship that she feels like this is the next step for her.\n\nWhat I can say is that the lock is only only going to cause new issues. You two are going to have to talk this out more. And you have to ask yourself if this is something you can overlook or if it's too much. You did put some boundaries out, and she didn't respect them.

Some couples have no problem having one person use the bathroom while the other one is brushing their teeth or in the shower. If they complain, it's because when you flush, the shower gets hot. Some couples are not comfortable with that and insist on being alone in the bathroom. Either way is fine, as long as the other person in the relationship respects that.\n\nSo it's not about the underwear. It's about the fact that he has told her that it bothers him when she uses his underwear, and she won't stop.\n\nAnd yes, that is worth breaking up over.", "[deleted]", "Matching sets for the win.     \nNTA", "This was my SO\u2019s complaint also the one time his luggage got lost and he was hoping to just get by with what we had in my bag for a couple of days until his caught up with us.", "Especially when it\u2019s underwear. Nobody should be forced to share their clothes and underwear if they don\u2019t want to.", "Hawt af", "Yah. I have no desire to wear men's underwear in particular that has been used. haha. I have no idea why that would be the hill OP's partner is choosing to die on.", "Somehow i got triggered with her stretch out your boxers\u2026 al of it is a big no but don\u2019t fucking stretch my clothes \ud83e\udd2c", ">We don't, we have to use a laundromat.\n\nAny chance she just doesn't want to do/pay for as much laundry, so she uses your stuff?\n\nAlso, saying \"my exes didn't have a problem with this\" is gaslighting. Based on that sentence alone, i'd break up", "I'll be honest, I didn't read your reply. It seems you have a lot to say and I'm happy for you that you feel so strongly about this. I did read the first sentence though and I'll just say that you're entitled to your opinion, and leave it at that. Have a good day!", ">It was cute when it first started but she changes clothes twice a day so that's 3 pair of underoos coming out of my drawer daily. \n\nLook if you just don't hygienically like it. Fair enough. Was just going off the statement you made that it was too much dirty underwear. Its the same amount of underwear if its boxers or panties, so assumed it was that you just didn't ever have clean underwear unless you washed often.\n\nJust buying more underwear for both of you solves that. But again if the issue isn't that 3 pairs were being dirtied daily then I guess I don't get the statement you made.", "Question - Why dont you wear the new underwear and let her use your old underwear if she likes ot that much?", "Where did you learn to read?", "Would a fair compromise be that she washes the undies shes taken daily so your supply never dips? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Your edited reasons are why she\u2019s going to leave you over choosing this hill to die on.  Her vag is fine for you to dip your dick in, but being near your underwear is gross?  YTA, for your edit alone.", "It\u2019s a definite Main Character Pick Me move to restate the edits made after my comment for karma.", "Wearing his boxers is disrespecting him as a person? Lol. K. \n\nYou're single, yes?", "Could she really hear herself saying that? She made it two words into the sentence before completely shutting down her own argument.", "They must have, they are her ex's now. They decided to get rid of her and not the underwear.", "I tried a pair of thong undies (men's) once at my wife's request. They were awful. I dont know how she can stand thong or g-string panties. I'm just glad she finds them comfy because she looks damn sexy in them.", "Not the only thing they'll be riding up if he doesn't tuck.", "They make male thongs and panties with built in junk pouches that are quite frankly, really gorgeous and comfy. Otherwise I agree with the sides issue, it's really awkward and feels terrible", "I can't say I agree. Everything feels a little squashed.", "Why can she ruin his, but he can't ruin her's? Double standards are crap.", "I appreciate you", "That\u2019s true, we haven\u2019t kept the bra\u2019s opinion in mind and anyone who has ever worn a bra knows that they have opinions.", "Foundation-- that stuff is EXPENSIVE and while a little bit can go a long way, a novice (like myself when trying new styles) can easily overapply.", "No   She\u2019s stretching his out   Stretch out the bra!", "Stupid Sexy Flanders!", "Yeah, that too.  But the point is that he's allowed to not want his underwear worn by her, and doesn't need to 'compromise' on that.", "There\u2019s a few other people who posted and said they do the same thing as OP\u2019s girlfriend but with consent.  One of them said it\u2019s an intimacy thing.  I guess as long as it\u2019s mutually agreed upon, to each their own\u2026uh, to each their partner\u2019s undies?", "Super creepy like the human version of an animal marking its territory", "No, she gets no pairs per day, other than the ones OP bought exclusively for her. Wearing someone else's underwear is always an AH move, unless the owner of said underwear has given their permission.", "Or she simply doesn't wear his underwear like he asked. It's a simple thing to respect his wishes", "Why compromise?  He doesn't want her wearing his underwear.  At all.  She's not listening and not respecting him.  There's no need for a compromise.  Girlfriend needs to stay in her lane with this, she's being gross.  She doesn't deserve a trade off.", "When he has asked her repeatedly not to do something? Yes, it is disrespectful to him as a person to wear it when he has asked her to respect his wishes.. I'm shocked that you need that explained to you.\n\nAnd no, I'm not single, because I actually respect my partner and listen.", "Thank you; I was thinking that to! NTA", "\"Ben used to buy me things, Zack gave me compliments all the time, Joe would remember what I like, so why bla bla bla.\"\n\nI can just hear her. No thank you!", "I\u2019m pretty sure no one was saying it\u2019s because putting a lock on was difficult\u2026", "\"are you wearing ladies underwear?\" \n\n\"I most certainly am not!\"", "You have to relax and accept the string. \ud83d\ude02 (I don't get it either, I'm not that into wedgies.)", "I\u2019m a woman and my mom bought me a few pairs of thongs for a school formal so it wouldn\u2019t show my panty lines through the dress. It was the most uncomfortable piece of clothing ever- right next to stirrup pants.", "I think it\u2019s an interesting story", "\ud83e\udd23 the best comment I've seen so far today", "My nephew always liked wearing them on his head", "Making his undergarments dirty and in need of laundering is not comparable to destroying bras. Maybe it\u2019s just because I have a large cup size but my last bra was $44 on sale from $65. \n\nIdeally, she would respect his boundaries because this isn\u2019t cute or funny or comfortable. He\u2019s expressed discomfort and unhappiness and she continues doing it. (Also three times a day?! Yikes.) \n\nIf not, well? Negligees are far more comfortable than bras. He can lounge around his home once he breaks up with her.", "haha. Yah.  Not my thing I don't get the intimacy aspect but, whatever peoples kinks are theirs as long as it's not hurting someone else.", "It's just an option, mature people living together tend to compromise when they have problems vs being unhappy but based on your comment history it doesn't seem like you are capable of such a thing.", "They are *clothes*. These people clearly do not belong together. Locking your underwear up is extreme.", "> I couldn't imagine going through that effort to lock up underwear \n\nThat's the comment I am talking about. That comment *does* say it takes effort to lock up underwear.", "I heard Eddie Izzard say this once.", "LOL- funniest thing i ever heard.  Radical acceptance of the string.", "I do", "The underwire ones make great Mickey Mouse ears.", "You only really need to wear them that way when you're turning a Barbie doll into an all-powerful being to guide you through the pains of being a nerd.", "OMG OP should make parody tiktoks, with girlfriend's cute panties as a spiderman/deadpool mask hahaha", "He said she stretches them out.  And depending on how acidic a womans discharge is due to the varying ph levels, discharge can actually bleach underwear.  Women tend to have bigger butts, I can understand OP not wanting all his underwear backsides being droopy.", "Mine are usually $75-$115 :(", "Plot twist. \n\nOps girlfriend is a fucking chihuahua", "That's hilarious.  So even though he's asked her to stop multiple times and she hasn't, he's not being mature?  He needs to find a way to make her happy?  I don't think so.  She needs to stop wearing his underwear because he asked her to.  Look at my history all you want but that doesn't give you a one up.", "You are probably correct because OP deserves someone better.", "Agreed, this is some weird power play by GF. OP is NTA", "\u201cThis is my gun!\u201d", "We forgot to hook up the doll...", "Bathing twice a day is excessive and is actually bad for your skin", "\"This is for fighting.\"", "Better check the closet for a nuclear warhead, then. Best of luck. Say hi to Nanny and Grampa.", "You don\u2019t work in healthcare do you? Lol you NEED to shower and change clothing post work, for health and safety reasons.", "She's probably not showering twice a day, she's showering after work.\n\nShe has day clothes, which she wears out of the house in the morning to go to work and get \"dirty\", and then she comes home to shower and change into clean house clothes.", "Some chronic pain suffers would beg to disagree with you.  Hot showers or baths can help relieve a lot of pain, stiffness, and soreness.  Two showers/baths a day is a minimum for some people some days.  I hope no one with chronic pain listens to you because doing what is needed to reduce pain and be functional is not excessive.   (within reason, not popping a ton of pills or drinking you pain away, etc).  Also, not everyone gets bad skin when showering multiple times a day.  Please don't talk as if what you say is true for every single person in existence.", "That makes sense but that\u2019s only 2 pairs of underwear, where is the hties", "Dude I\u2019m not talking about people with chronic pain, I\u2019m talking about the average person. Why should I have to clarify that? For the average person using soap to rid your skin of oils twice a day is bad. That is just a scientific fact, there are many studies on it.", "The third is him wearing underwear. He uses up 3 pairs a day when he would normally only use up 1", "None of those studies indicate or prove that 100% of people who shower twice or more a day ends up with their skin ruined.  Not getting bad or dry skin from showering multiple times a day isn't limited to only people who have chronic pain.  Yes, sometimes you have be specific on things and not give generalizations.  The way you said it indicates you mean everyone.  If you don't mean everyone then yes, specify."]}
