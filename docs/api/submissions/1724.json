Also, she sounds like she did it to you plenty. NTA", "Unless it was your mother's birthday cake NTA. This isn't an allergy or religious embargo or vegetarian issue. It's a matter of preference AND it's not even a main course nor did you make an entire meal filled with items she didnt like. It's one side dessert treat that you baked because you love it and wanted to share it. Your mother can pick out the raisins or open a Little Debbie's for herself.", "NTA you like the cake and wanted to share it with others.", "NTA your mom can pick them out. It\u2019s not like olives where they leave gross transfer residue. Or she can just not eat it. It\u2019s cake, not the only food on a dessert island.", "Well, you do know ahe hates them but I am laughing cos it's actually a really good example of whats good for you is good for them.....", "NTA, Unless this cake was specifically for something to celebrate your mom, like her Bday or anniversary or something. \n\nRaisins in cake are delicious. If you don\u2019t like raisin cake, don\u2019t eat raisin cake.", "NTA. Your mother's an adult. She can pick out raisins, knowing everyone else likes the taste. She can eat a piece of fruit as a treat. Or she can abstain. All of these options can be done without making a scene, something your mother, family, and particularly sister never learned. \n\nNot having a damn piece of cake isn't the end of all things.

It's not like you're showing up to Thanksgiving dinner with a raisin sculpted into a turkey. She doesn't have to eat the cake, and if by some chance she'll implode if she doesn't have cake, raisins are about the easiest food to pick around.", "NTA, you don't have to make cakes for her at all.", "NTA- she can choose not to eat it", "NTA but maybe just tell your mum your mad that you sister got preferential treatment over you. You didn\u2019t have to bake and you didn\u2019t have to choose to put raisins in it but you did to give your mum the same treatment as she gave you.", "NTA.  A little passive aggressive but not rising to AH level.", "NTA. You are not obliged to bake for anyone, so she has no reasonable expectation that her preference will be accommodated. Cake is bonus food; it is not meant to meet nutritional needs. On the other hand, your mother was obligated to feed you as a child, and she did it in a way that didn't accommodate your preferences, so you're perfectly fine returning the favor.", "My mom did the same shit to me. She'd order food with onions and tell me to pick them out. When I had my son, I vowed to NEVER do that to him. \n\nWhat you did was funny AF.", "NTA - I hate beetroot but a friend of mine once made beetroot pesto and it was actually pretty nice. Your mom should 100% try your cake, it could be a nice surprise.", "NTA\n\nYour mother didn't have to eat the cake. She could pick out the raisins, but maybe she would have liked the cake with the raisins in it. \n\nIt would have been nice if you had made something without the raisins for your mom, but you weren't required to do so. Tell your sister to grow up as the next cake you bake might especially for her (insert evil laugh).", "NAH\n\n\nI am in solidarity with mom despite the judgement. Raisins in cake is a crime against humanity.", "INFO: Be honest here. Did you make your family the cake because you found the cake, really liked it, and just wanted to make some for your family? Or did you make your family the cake because you realized that this was an opportunity for you get revenge on your mom and tell her to \"pick out the bits\" like she told you? \n\nI'm asking because if your whole family is mad, I'm wondering if you did this in a smug, obviously-getting-revenge tone. If so, ugh, that's just obnoxious and petty. If you're still bitter about her doing that, you can have a conversation with her and express your frustration. But if that's really not the case, then I'd say you're not TA because it's just a cake you wanted to bake and you can't always cater to everyone's likes and dislikes at all times.\n\nAlso I'm assuming that this wasn't for your mom's birthday or some other event for her, because if so then you'd obviously be TA. Normally I wouldn't assume these things, but it's strange that your sister said \"you should have baked something else\" if this was a random \"I just liked this cake so I baked one on a random Tuesday\" situation.", "As a fellow raisin hater, I really wanna vote Y T A, LOL, but you proposed a perfectly reasonable solution, so I\u2019m going with NTA. Your family needs to chill the heck out.", "NTA. And I love it! It\u2019s never fun when the shoe\u2019s on the other foot. How\u2019s it feel, ma?!", "INFO: Are you saying you live elsewhere and baked this cake to bring to a family gathering? Or you all live together and you just baked a cake for no specific reason?", "ESH\n\nYou're mom is the biggest AH for putting you through that for all those years, so while it's an AH move - go for it :) \n\nIf she absolutely hates it - she can pick out the raisins or just not eat any cake.  You aren't denying her dinner - many people don't have dessert and live to tell about it.", "Esh. That said, I would do the same. This is more petty revenge.\n\nYou are doing something wrong on purpose, ah move, but I agree with the justification. Being an AH doesn't mean you aren't right", "YTA.  Raisins don't belong in baked goods", "ESH. You're in the wrong for deliberately making food for your mother that you know she won't eat. I fully sympathise that this is retaliation for her doing the same thing (hence judgment on both of you rather than just you), but two wrongs etc.\n\nIf you'd made the cake for literally any other purpose, for example to have at home and she asked if she could have some of it, you'd be in the clear. I think a better handling of this situation would have been to refuse to make the cake at all, and if  your mother argued just tell her the only recipes you know have raisins in. Be the bigger person.", "YTA, and I have a hard time believing you don\u2019t know it.  *No one* but you wants raisins in this cake.  Make your own cake exclusively *for* you if you want a cake with raisins so damn badly, and either make your mom something she\u2019ll want to eat without hassle, or just decline to handle catering for this occasion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you bring something for a party or group, the idea is that it's FOR THE GROUP. while you can't cater to everyone's individual tastes, it's pretty easy to do cater to the things most people enjoy. \n\nMost people aren't fans of cake with raisins. Hell, most people are disappointed to find raisins in a cookie, much less a cake. (I actually like oatmeal raisin cookies, and even I don't want raisins in a cake.

Because then it's not that OP \"should have baked something else\" because it wasn't an occasion for baking, it was just OP wanting to make that specific cake. That's what makes me suspect that they baked it for some family occasion, potentially one for their mom herself. That's why I asked for info.\n\nOf course, there's a chance that the cake was random, but mom just complained a lot and the sister is used to being catered to.
