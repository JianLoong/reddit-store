I tried my best to reply or at least upvote to every comment.\n\nI was happy to hear that I wasn\u2019t the whole. But as far as advice went, I got a lot of mixed feedback. Some telling me to call Jess out. Some telling me there\u2019s nothing I can do. Some telling me to host a party on the same day and invite all the kids in their class.\n\nI decided to contact our rabbi whose wife is also the assistant principal of their school. They said they think talking with Jess and having a sit down conversation is the best way to go. On Saturday, they asked Jess to stay after services to have a talk.\n\nIt was the Rabbi, his wife, me, my wife, Jess and her ex. The rabbis wife explained that school policy says that you can either invite less than half of the class or the entire class and Jude was the only child not invited. Jess replied that Jude is horribly I\u2019ll mannered and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want him at the party. We all were curious to know if she had any other instances of his \u201cbad manners\u201d and she started listing that he likes running around and jumping off things (typical 5 year old behavior) \n\nIt was honestly comedic since anyone who\u2019s spent any time with them 2 knows Jonah is by far the crazy one. But anyways she couldn\u2019t come up with any real examples of his bad behavior other than the bathroom incident which she horribly exaggerated since the last time we talked about it. \n\nThe rabbis wife said that the only way this could be a valid reason for the school board was if she filed a complaint with the synagogue and the school and then they would both investigate. So she caved and said they could both come. And we said we would decide if we wanted to.\n\nHer ex came up to us as we were leaving(after not saying anything the whole meeting) he said not to come to the birthday party since Jess is going to be a momzilla and probably be an asshole the whole time. We organized a play date for a few days after the party is planned at his house and he ensured the boys would get goody bags and cake. Clearly the most important things.\n\nAnyways good news all around, the boys are pretty much over it and they think we\u2019re being drama queens. Anyways, thanks Reddit!", "created_utc": 1702427909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18h2w0v/update_wibta_if_i_called_a_little_girls_mother_to/", "score": 2803, "replies": ["Glad to see the ex is a reasonable person.

She has been shamed for her behaviour, and given how badly she reacted in the first place, she will undoubtedly find some way to punish both of your sons for her humiliation.

If you hand them out outside of school, you don\u2019t have your follow their rules and they can\u2019t enforce them.", "Yeah, I never particularly wanted to have a big, whole class birthday, but there were times in elementary school when I'd get along well with most of my classmates and have one or two tormentors. It would have sucked if I'd really wanted a big party, but because of school policy either couldn't have one or would have had to invite the boy who threw a rock at my head.", "I think if you want to exclude a handful you could probably get away with only half the class.\nI prefer the rule of just not handing out invites at school", "I disagree.

He's practically a toddler!", "I used to work at a law firm that had a small, one-person bathroom right in the middle of a bunch offices. The door opened right into the main hallway people would walk by, and there were client filing cabinets right next to it. The lock had one of those red/green things on it so you would know if it was occupied or empty, but the danger was that if you saw it was green, you would assume it was empty and open the door without knocking. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I walked by and saw someone opening the door, thinking it was empty, and there was some 60-year-old partner sitting on the toilet with his pants around his ankles.", "She should have locked the door", "Once, many years ago, I accidentally walked in on a patient in the bathroom.

What was actually accomplished here? OP already knew \"why\" her son wasn't invited. It's not like it was a mystery. The mother didn't change, apologize, or improve in any way, which should be expected from someone like Jess.\n\nSo what? OP wanted Jess to be shamed and forced into inviting both of her kids only to not attend anyway? Who would even send their kid to that party anyway after all of this? Jess would clearly have resentment towards them.\n\nI could understand having this meeting if Jess escalated the situation by going around and spreading lies about his son to everyone, but it doesn't seem like that was the case. This was a good time to teach their kids that not everyone will be decent people, and sometimes someone will have an issue with you over nothing and that you can't let them bother you.", "That advice was literally all over the original post.\n\nAnd it's good advice. It's not tattling, it's involving a neutral and respected member of the community to settle a dispute amicably. It's literally his job.", "Erm, where does her kid say that she stirred up too much drama? Her kids are 5. That's not really something they say.\n\nThe original post absolutely had a lot of talk to the rabbi. In many communities, a religious leader can serve as a mediator for situations like these. Provide unbiased counsel to ensure a fair resolution. \n\nIt's more common than you might think and when a mother is accusing a 5 year old boy of deliberately trying to come into the women's bathroom to spy on her and her daughter, it's also a sensible precaution to ensure spreading such accusations doesn't continue when he is older.\n\nAlso harassed? That's a gross exaggeration.", "I got it many, many times. And at my old synagogue I would\u2019ve never done that because it just wasn\u2019t like that there.

It's not asking for votes.", "Why is she TA?", "Exactly", "Unless that \"one\" is actually a bully.

She doesn't have an incident to blow out of proportion with Jonah, but she does with Jude, so she's using it to punish OP for being young and not being deferential to her parenting opinions. That's my guess, at least. She probably felt like OP disrespected her by not agreeing about Jude needing to be punished, so she's being like \"I'll show you\" and punishing Jude on her own. \"I'll force this kid to feel the shame I expected you to make him feel.\"", "He's the first one she had anything approaching an acceptable explanation for treating OP badly using their child as the weapon.

The little boy that has hit my son is a twin and he lashes out when he gets overstimulated whereas his twin sister hits herself when overstimulated. I understand they are all a group of special needs kids, but that doesn't make it okay for the boy to hit my son. I don't allow my son to hit anyone when he gets upset nor do I allow him to hit himself. I have 2 autistic sons and 3 neurotypical sons and a diagnosis isn't justification for hitting another person.", "Na, the sad part is that she's completely predictable. She's going to be a gossipy, miserable old bitty. We have those in Christianity too. She's going to act like a stuck up asshole anytime she can get away with it from here on out.", "I agree. So just invite less than half the class. No kid needs a whole class party anyway.", "I didn't say anything about inviting them . But younger kids don't need to be singled out no matter what. \nFine for teens and adults, but singling younger kids out for whatever reason is bullying. \nHave a smaller party instead.\n\nI agree that they need consequences and parenting and maybe medical help, but many parents don't give their kids that. That's not the kid's fault. They are victims.", "I didn't say that they need to be invited. But I don't agree with singling kids out. Adults is a different thing,  even teens, but not younger kids. Stick to fewer kids.", "It's not necessary to invite the whole class. A smaller party is no less enjoyable.", "So, other kids should be punished for the bad behavior of one. Cool.", "You did. Why should half the class be punished because one kid is an asshole who needs to be parented?", "Not being invited to a party of a classmate you don't know well is not a \"punishment\". No kid is actually friends with their whole class. Just invite the kids they're actually friends with.", "Why do Americans invite the whole class? A party is not better just because there are more kids. Don't kids in America have closer friends in class?\nWhy is it necessary to invite everyone but one kid?", "In this case I think it might be wig pulling anyway", "How do you know the kids don't know each other well? \ud83d\ude44", "Why do you care?", "It\u2019s usually just a rule for little kids, if at all. If we are being real, it mostly prevents kids wasting the teachers time literally crying about it. My kindergarten class had like 35 6 year olds and one teacher, they seriously don\u2019t have time for that.", "Nobody's BFF with 25 people.", "Why was the ex there?", "I wonder if the kid walked in on her doing something bad...", "I dont like it as a school policy but I think its a good personal policy. Like there was a recent post about how OP\u2019s daughter wanted to have a big birthday party but wanted to exclude one kid and had no real reason why. So the parent enforced this rule themselves. Obviously, if a child is a bully, they shouldn\u2019t be invited.", "He\u2019s her dad and I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s running the party too", "I\u2019m just saying it was a weird justification to her inviting Jonah but not Jude. Jonah\u2019s the one that\u2019s loud and likes running around. Jude usually likes to play with his action figures and that\u2019s it.", "As a teacher, exactly this- yeah- I will not allow invitations to anything to be passed out in my classroom or while I'm supervising them. Not my job to police who gets invited and who doesn't, and it causes drama that affects the whole class, parents get upset and come to me to ask why I allowed this to happen and suddenly on top of all the other things I have to do for students that should not be my responsibility, now I'm involved in social lives and drama between parents. \n\nIf you're a parent and you're listening to this, if you think your child's teacher is a decent human being in any way, do not send invitations to school.", "Ahhh but what to you is a \" small\" class? 20? 26? Those are the numbers in my district but I'd love to know what it's like in your area.", "Eh, rabbis aren\u2019t really \u2018religious authorities\u2019 in the same way as Christian clergy. If it\u2019s a small, close-knit shul (or a bigger one with multiple rabbis) this kind of community mediation is a normal part of the job.", "I would be even further distressed by the fact that teachers have to share bathrooms with students and don't have their own toilet to use. What the hell...", "What I thought right away after the end.", "Ok but what if my kid is friends with the whole classroom and doesn't want to invite the bully? What should I tell him\n\n\"Well son you can't have the party you like, not because we can't give you one, but because the kid that bullies you would feel bad for not going to your party\"", "Yeah, the hard part to predict is how that will develop. Sometimes, this kind of rumors take root and can stain someone's life, and some other times, the people around them know they are not to be trusted, and this kind of nonsense can really make a child's life very hard.", "I was friends with my whole class in my primary school except for three kids (the bullies), literally begged my dad for a private part instead of a class one (which was the usual there) so I could invite all my friends and not have them ruin it.\n\n(Not American btw)", "Idk why ur getting downvoted I\u2019m dying\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "It seems expectations have changed a lot over the decades in terms of size/expense. \n\nWhen I was a little kid most birthday parties had less than 10 kids invited and it was generally the closest neighbours amongst the class (and maybe some older/younger schoolmates from the neighbourhood) because that's who we walked to and from school with every day.", "You know, I think if it was a thing here to invite the whole class probably my daughter would be one of those excluded. She isn't difficult at all, but she's got ADHD, so she's a little weird and not popular and we live in a fairly rural area and her father is a foreigner, which seems to be a problem for many people here. She had to change class last year because in the old one nobody would talk to her. It's not uncommon for neurodivergent people to be excluded and it can have a very negative impact on their mental health for a long time afterwards, and parents contributing to this are not good people in my book."]}
