I tried my best to reply or at least upvote to every comment.\n\nI was happy to hear that I wasn\u2019t the whole. But as far as advice went, I got a lot of mixed feedback. Some telling me to call Jess out. Some telling me there\u2019s nothing I can do. Some telling me to host a party on the same day and invite all the kids in their class.\n\nI decided to contact our rabbi whose wife is also the assistant principal of their school. They said they think talking with Jess and having a sit down conversation is the best way to go. On Saturday, they asked Jess to stay after services to have a talk.\n\nIt was the Rabbi, his wife, me, my wife, Jess and her ex. The rabbis wife explained that school policy says that you can either invite less than half of the class or the entire class and Jude was the only child not invited. Jess replied that Jude is horribly I\u2019ll mannered and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want him at the party. We all were curious to know if she had any other instances of his \u201cbad manners\u201d and she started listing that he likes running around and jumping off things (typical 5 year old behavior) \n\nIt was honestly comedic since anyone who\u2019s spent any time with them 2 knows Jonah is by far the crazy one. But anyways she couldn\u2019t come up with any real examples of his bad behavior other than the bathroom incident which she horribly exaggerated since the last time we talked about it. \n\nThe rabbis wife said that the only way this could be a valid reason for the school board was if she filed a complaint with the synagogue and the school and then they would both investigate. So she caved and said they could both come. And we said we would decide if we wanted to.\n\nHer ex came up to us as we were leaving(after not saying anything the whole meeting) he said not to come to the birthday party since Jess is going to be a momzilla and probably be an asshole the whole time. We organized a play date for a few days after the party is planned at his house and he ensured the boys would get goody bags and cake. Clearly the most important things.\n\nAnyways good news all around, the boys are pretty much over it and they think we\u2019re being drama queens. Anyways, thanks Reddit!", "created_utc": 1702427909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18h2w0v/update_wibta_if_i_called_a_little_girls_mother_to/", "score": 1887, "replies": ["Glad to see the ex is a reasonable person. Skipping the official party is probably a good idea. Avoiding her in general is probably a good idea.", "I know that Jess excluded Jude for an utterly bullshit reason.\n\n> The rabbis wife explained that school policy says that you can either invite less than half of the class or the entire class and Jude was the only child not invited.\n\nBut I *still* hate policies like this. There *do* occasionally exist **good** reasons to exclude a handful of unwanted classmates.", "I really can\u2019t imagine being so uptight that I freak out over a 5 year old walking in on me in the bathroom, I\u2019m surprised she was able to push her own kid out. Glad the kids still get along and I hope the play date goes well. NTA.", "Man, accidents like that can be easy to have happen. Last month I co-worker walked in on me in the bathroom (I thought he saw me go in there so I didnt think to lock the door). And I walked in on a diff co-worker. Its been a good 13 or so years since I was on an end of an \"whoops!\" Moment like that and in a couple weeks I had been on both sides. Accidents can happen and I'm glad your boys will still get some cake and goodies.", "My question is: who doesn\u2019t lock the door to a public bathroom. He\u2019s 5 and way too young to be doing it to \u201cpeek\u201d or really care about what bathroom is which. A 5 yo that has to pee isn\u2019t doing much thinking and it\u2019s also pretty common for little boys to go into the women\u2019s bathrooms with their moms.", "Her ex is a good guy.", "You absolutely did the right thing by going to the Rabbi. Everyone knows Jude did nothing wrong, but people who decide to make problems out of situations like this can ruin lives. Even a 5yo's life. Notifying the appropriate adults in the situation keeps her from spreading further gossip and lies.\n\nThe one thing I would say - and I know it's unfair to her daughter who is innocent - but you need to be very careful about your children being around her daughter. Even with her ex's approval and support. She has been shamed for her behaviour, and given how badly she reacted in the first place, she will undoubtedly find some way to punish both of your sons for her humiliation. Keep your sons safe, whatever that means.", "I guess we know why she is the ex. I would definitely take him up on his invitation than put your son(s) through her talking ill of him, both sons and/or you. Neither of your sons  need to be put through her pettiness and Momzilla attitude over an accident. You son doesn't need her watching over him and possibly scolding him for just being present. I think the birthday child's father is giving you the best advice and solution. He would definitely know more about could potentially happen to your son(s) being at the party.", "I like the ex!", "Good for you!!!!", "I'm so glad you got this sorted. I walked into the men's bathroom in college as a 28 year old. The 50 something year old walking behind me thought it was hilarious when I ran back out. She told me she just assumed I was trans! Point being, give your buddy a hug for me. This stuff happens.", "nah, just let em eat cake and call it a day. kids will be kids. moms can be assholes.", "I\u2019m more weirded out s to why a grown woman is freaking out about a 5 year old walking in on her than anything", "I had a birthday party for my 4 yr old in preschool. I invited 4 out of the 5 boys in his class. He told me Owen was mean to him. I regret not inviting that child 25 years later. Everyone plays or no one plays.", "I think there was no reason to bring to too the rabbi. Some people just suck. Tell your kids some people are just nasty and take them to do something fun", "I'm sorry, you did *what*? \n\nI agree with your kid, you stirred up way too much drama. Literally no one told you to tattle to the rabbi. That was the advice of literally no one. You could have just kept both boys home or taken them out to do something fun instead, but no, you harassed this lady and made an uncomfortable situation for your sons.\n\nYTA.", "ESH, don\u2019t be a helicopter parent. Your kid didn\u2019t get invited to a birthday party, it happens. Are you going to go to every business that doesn\u2019t hire him when he gets older and demand he get hired? The mom should have let the daughter pick who she wants to go to the party, it\u2019s the kids not the moms. The school also sucks for not letting kids decide who they want at their parties that are not on school time or property.", "Yta", "Yea you would", "YTA.", "Grrr... I think they should go anyway. But you get to decide.", "Wow you suck.", "I was kinda hoping someone pointing out to her why she didn't properly lock the door while she's on the toilet", "I like that there is a way that you can still invite classmates without it expected to be everyone at least. No matter what the reasons, it's crappy to invite all but one", "Yeah I dislike the rule as well. I was honestly against having the rabbis wife there at first as well but my wife convinced me. I didn\u2019t really want an invite to the party, I just wanted to talk about why she was so against him coming.", "These policies usually exist for when you\u2019re handing out your invitations at school. If you hand them out outside of school, you don\u2019t have your follow their rules and they can\u2019t enforce them.", "Yeah, I never particularly wanted to have a big, whole class birthday, but there were times in elementary school when I'd get along well with most of my classmates and have one or two tormentors. It would have sucked if I'd really wanted a big party, but because of school policy either couldn't have one or would have had to invite the boy who threw a rock at my head.", "I think if you want to exclude a handful you could probably get away with only half the class.\nI prefer the rule of just not handing out invites at school", "I disagree. A small class of young children needs to be a few or all. It\u2019s a fairly common practice.", "They were prepared to listen if there is a good reason.", "In the first part, it really seems like it's not the kid himself she dislikes, but the op", "And this was a FIVE YEAR OLD!  He's practically a toddler!", "I used to work at a law firm that had a small, one-person bathroom right in the middle of a bunch offices. The door opened right into the main hallway people would walk by, and there were client filing cabinets right next to it. The lock had one of those red/green things on it so you would know if it was occupied or empty, but the danger was that if you saw it was green, you would assume it was empty and open the door without knocking. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I walked by and saw someone opening the door, thinking it was empty, and there was some 60-year-old partner sitting on the toilet with his pants around his ankles.", "She should have locked the door", "Once, many years ago, I accidentally walked in on a patient in the bathroom. We both laughed and apologized to the other and continued to have a good professional relationship until she passed (cancer patient, I checked her in three times a week for various appointments). I switched from the front desk to the ER and I still always knock even when I 100% know there\u2019s nobody in the room.", "Yeah idk what dimension Jess was living in.", "Probably why he\u2019s an ex \ud83d\ude02", "Unfortunately, this OP!", "People will disagree with this, but I think you're right. What was actually accomplished here? OP already knew \"why\" her son wasn't invited. It's not like it was a mystery. The mother didn't change, apologize, or improve in any way, which should be expected from someone like Jess.\n\nSo what? OP wanted Jess to be shamed and forced into inviting both of her kids only to not attend anyway? Who would even send their kid to that party anyway after all of this? Jess would clearly have resentment towards them.\n\nI could understand having this meeting if Jess escalated the situation by going around and spreading lies about his son to everyone, but it doesn't seem like that was the case. This was a good time to teach their kids that not everyone will be decent people, and sometimes someone will have an issue with you over nothing and that you can't let them bother you.", "That advice was literally all over the original post.\n\nAnd it's good advice. It's not tattling, it's involving a neutral and respected member of the community to settle a dispute amicably. It's literally his job.", "Erm, where does her kid say that she stirred up too much drama? Her kids are 5. That's not really something they say.\n\nThe original post absolutely had a lot of talk to the rabbi. In many communities, a religious leader can serve as a mediator for situations like these. Provide unbiased counsel to ensure a fair resolution. \n\nIt's more common than you might think and when a mother is accusing a 5 year old boy of deliberately trying to come into the women's bathroom to spy on her and her daughter, it's also a sensible precaution to ensure spreading such accusations doesn't continue when he is older.\n\nAlso harassed? That's a gross exaggeration.", "I got it many, many times. And at my old synagogue I would\u2019ve never done that because it just wasn\u2019t like that there. But here the rabbi is very hands on and that\u2019s just the culture here.", "Honestly making someone consider their bad actions (the mom completely overreacting to a minor accident) is worth doing things like this. Are you the mom in OP\u2019s post? \ud83d\ude02", "You need to read the original post from a few days ago.", "This is an update post. It's not asking for votes.", "Why is she TA?", "Exactly", "Unless that \"one\" is actually a bully. (Obviously not the case here, but as OP pointed out, sometimes there IS a good reason to not invite one kid. There have even been other AITA posts where people agreed there was good enough reason.)", "Now we know why he (jess' husband) was an ex \ud83d\ude44", "Thank you for updating! I really hoped there would be a good resolution and frankly I think this was the best one could hope for.", "Why did you need to involve the rabbi in all this???", "This is what I was going to say. If you want to invite all but a handful, send texts or emails or snail mail.", "My kids go to a Jewish school and if you invite over half the kids in a class ti a birthday party, you are supposed to invite them all. This makes sense to me actually. When the kids are young, parents stay at the parties so it\u2019s not like the hosts have to watch the kids. Parents are supervising their own kids.", "My kids go to a Jewish school and if you invite over half the kids in a class ti a birthday party, you are supposed to invite them all.

I\u2019d say 10-15 kids is still a king party", "My 4 yr old likes everyone in his class except 1 kid.... The one kid who hits my son.... My son refuses to share with that kid.... Kinda makes me proud that my son is setting boundaries even though he struggles to communicate the \"why\" behind his actions.", "She seems to not mind the other twin being around.", "Esp if you habe your own kid that age, you all the more should know the occasional accident like that will happen.", "Ok, why is this a thing? I absolutely ALWAYS lock the door for the bathroom and am paranoid about it at work. Like every time I use the bathroom, I double-check the knob to make sure it's locked. Apparently, the men I work with have walked in on each other a bunch of times because they forgot to lock the door. \n\nHow do you forget to lock the door when you're about to get partially naked at work? No one should have to knock before entering a bathroom with a lock because there should be no reason not to lock the door.", "I did, mom didn\u2019t like the kid cause he came into women\u2019s bathroom on accident. Still doesn\u2019t change my opinion. ESH.", "Because people should be allowed to choose who they invite to their non school events.  This idea that everyone is owed an invite is hilarious.", "Then hand the invites out outside of school.", "Because he\u2019d had enough of her shit and was happier not having to deal with it every day?", "So when Jess further exaggerates the story, they have two of the most respected members of the community that know the truth and can dispute the claims.", "Because the mom needed to be reminded she\u2019s a part of a community and how to behave like it", "Having a 'neutral party' sit in on community relationship issues helps keep things civilized. Two moms might start screaming & hair pulling, but they'll behave themselves in front of the rabbi.", "It's called mediation. It's one of the things a rabbi is there for.", "Neutral party as others have said and also a pillar/leader of the community.", "I think if the mum had said that OP's son hits her child, the conversation would have gone quite differently.", "Yeah, but it's only one of the twins that she thinks she should teach OP a lesson about. She doesn't have an incident to blow out of proportion with Jonah, but she does with Jude, so she's using it to punish OP for being young and not being deferential to her parenting opinions. That's my guess, at least. She probably felt like OP disrespected her by not agreeing about Jude needing to be punished, so she's being like \"I'll show you\" and punishing Jude on her own. \"I'll force this kid to feel the shame I expected you to make him feel.\"", "He's the first one she had anything approaching an acceptable explanation for treating OP badly using their child as the weapon. The woman has a history of riding OP about being young and thinking she could tell them how to raise their children, but had no leg to stand on since their children behave as normal 5 year olds. She grasping at straws to paint OP as an interior parent and exert any possible control over their child.", "Especially when you don't lock the door.", "Right? Like, sure, at home I don't even fully close the bathroom door unless I'm about to take a shower because my cat is a codependent little brat and will sit there wailing at the door until I open it or start angrily body-checking it to try and open it, but if I'm anywhere other than my own house the bathroom door is getting every lock engaged whenever I'm in there.", "Is it a man thing? One time I was working late, I had music on and keyboard was clacking at my desk, but one of the guys from upstairs was on his way out and swung by the bathroom on the other side of my cubicle wall and fully pissed and farted with the door wide open. Why *I* was the more embarrassed of the two of us is still bewildering.", "There can actually be lots of  problems with locked doors that it can still happen. Esp if noisy, it can be easy to not hear knocking or not hear a response...a door might be locked by accident/on purpose when someone leaves and so a locked door doesnt always equal occupied. I'm deaf, so in a dire situation, i'd ask a person to listen while i knock to let me know if someone responds.", "I'm glad you agree that the birthday girl should be allowed to choose the guests invited to her birthday party. She wanted both twins there. When the boys asked why Jude wasn't invited, she said she didn't know (her mom wouldn't tell her, just that he wasn't allowed to come)", "There's a difference between not inviting someone because you don't care for/want to deal with them and deliberately going out of your way to exclude them in front of their twin for the high crime of accidentally walking into the wrong bathroom because you failed to lock the door.", "Exactly. Just hope the daughter dont turn into her.", "Poor guy is still cleaning up after her though. Only 13 years to go!", "I do wish arbitration was more commonplace. Entirely too many people fail to realize that emotions and logic don\u2019t always exist in the same place, and it\u2019s okay to feel whatever one feels, it\u2019s not always okay to act upon those emotions.", "Yup", ">Two moms might start screaming & hair pulling,\n\nsexist much?", "Why confront someone if that's a risk of \"screaming & hair pulling\"? Why go to the birthday of a mother capable of that?\n\nIt's nonsense.

Guys might be less embarassed about it tho. I will say that I think there are a lot of times that enough thought did not go into where/how a bathroom is located and what's visable when the door opens.", "Mom's house.", "It doesn't matter why anyone doesn't want someone in their home/at their private event.", "So far it seems like she's okay--it sounded like she and the twin who had been excluded were plotting to sneak him in. Hopefully, dad and the rest of the adults around her help her stay kind.", "Two dads might start throwing punches.  I've seen both.", "Guess we know why you don't get invited to a lot of parties...", "Agreed! Cartoonishly cruel. If it were a movie, she'd have a really satisfying, yet goofy, comeuppance. I would say she'd accidentally walk in on the rabbi in the bathroom while distracted by yelling revealingly awful things at a kid, but that may not be goofy enough. Plus it just punishes the poor innocent rabbi! Any better ideas?", "Then don't invite their twin right in front of them.\n\nEdit: or actually, don't invite *other people* in front of them. That's rude. Do it privately.", "'screaming and hair pulling' is not the same as throwing punches. it's particularly, stereotypically sexist.", "Success ?", "Or don't invite their twin either.", "This guy lmao", "When you mentioned the ex I was expecting some bullshit but that ended up being prettt sweet and wholesome lol", "Why should anyone be forced to endure your brat?

Why would you want an invite to be around these people who don't like you and you don't like them them!? I would have just not had either kid go, nor would I even want to associate with someone like Jess.", "Glad you got it resolved hopefully she will she that she was being foolish. Glad too the ex warned you though and the boys got the playdate.", "I\u2019ve had children that age literally crawl between stalls and come into mine and didn\u2019t have this intense a reaction. Kids do weird shit, this is absolutely nothing", "Meh, no kid is actually friends with their *entire class* so if you don't want to deal with one asshole kid it's really not that hard to just invite less than half.\n\nIt's a good rule because kids are mean and could easily decide not to invite *one* kid because their shoes are the wrong colour, you know?", "There are good reasons for excluding people at times, but *this* situation is one of the reasons the rule was created - for when a parent is being unreasonable.", "How do they even enforce this after the invites have gone out? And since its a private party i assume, there is nothing they can do to stop it.", "It's good that schools are trying to prevent bullying, but they should just forbid students from handing out invitations on school premises,", "Is it just me or this was meant to prevent division in case you get matching dates for birthday parties for different kids?", "I worked in a cafe a few years ago and forgot to lock the bathroom door one day. A little girl walked in on me and I felt terrible. It was kinda funny and I'm a young woman (not that it matters that much) but *I* apologised to *her* and moved in with my day. I know it's a bit different with the whole gendered bathrooms thing but that seems like such a small detail to me.", "A sane comment. OP is a bully. To bring in religious authority over a birthday party just so her kid can attend is insane to me. I hate private school moms like this.", "You're the one who involved her in the first place", "The type of school your child goes to is completely irrelevant. The school cannot enforce a policy for something that occurs offsite. Meaning, if you hand out the invites on campus, they can enforce it since you\u2019re doing it at school. But if the invitations are sent outside of school, there\u2019s literally nothing they can do. They can whine and complain sure, but they literally have zero right to manage your behavior off their grounds. \n\nAnd there are a number of reasons that families limit the size of a party and it rarely hasn\u2019t down with supervision. Not everyone can afford to host 20-30 kids. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA, just let em eat cake and call it a day. kids will be kids. moms can be assholes.", "Yeah, I have a similar situation, there's one kid who hits the other kids in class.  His mom opened up to me that she's talking to the pediatrician and he probably has ADHD.  I feel bad, they're trying.  But I'm not going to make my kid invite the boy who hits him.", "Sure but less than half or all deals with that - there's no chance someone can afford 25 but 26 is too many. And the option is there to just do 12.", "Exactly this. When I fist read her post I was worried Jess was going to continue retelling the story and exaggerating it. She already openly discriminated against him. This kind of person is unpredictable and it is better to have trusted people to back you up.", "Exactly.\n\nI currently work in child support. We've had three fights break out in the parking lot after court let out in the past two weeks. But they managed to play nice for hours in the courtroom.", "I could have chosen my words more carefully. Thank you for pointing it out.", "Having seen my fair share of fights, fights between girls tend to involve hair pulling. Fights between boys tend to involve punching. \n\nI suppose it could be different as adults. I haven\u2019t seen any actual fights involving adults that I can think of, but I also don\u2019t see why fighting styles magically change at 18."]}
