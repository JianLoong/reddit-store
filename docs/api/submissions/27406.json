I had more than 20 cousins and every sunday we would get together at my grandma\u2019s big house and play in the front and back yard. I used to be a little on the chubby side. Not obese. But like always 5-6 kgs heavier than i was supposed to be and it didnt help that all my cousins were slim and tall. I always felt left out. My mom has told me since i was 5 that if i dont lose the weight nobody would marry me. She restricted me to wearing the color black only bc she says that i look slim in black. Dinnertimes were the worst esp on sundays in grandma\u2019s place with everyone around , my plate would be snatched in front of my eyes if my mom thought i ate too much. Then , the aunties and uncles would be like \u201cyea she has had enough\u201d and my mom and dad would ridicule me for my weight. Only my cousins stood by my side. And i am the eldest of four children so i have never gotten any kind of affection growing up. Ive never hugged my parents. They always kiss and hug the youngest and second youngest but for me and my sister they were always so distant. Now i am in college in another state and if they do not call me i dont either bc frabkly there is nothing i miss about them. I talk to my sisters and brother but never to my parents. Yesterday they confronted me saying that they think i dont love them. I started crying and told them how i felt all these years and that i wish i wasnt their child. They\u2019re coming to my college to meet me in a month. What do i do? Apologize?

Don't apologize, but if you want you can sit them down and have a longer conversation about this if you think you can get through to him. I was a bigger kid growing up too, bigger than my younger sister and most of my cousins around my age. Not massively obese or anything but chubby and tall which only made me seem bigger compared to the other short and slim kids. My mom has always commented on my weight, I remember hurtful things she's said to me as a child even now at 28, that's how deeply it stuck with me. I'm still a bigger person now, again not obese but certainly a little over weight, and I still get the odd comment here and there from my mom or an aunt at a family gathering. I've got the worst self esteem and body image to the point where I'm in therapy for it (among other things), but people really don't understand how deeply this behavior can mess a child up. People act like it comes from a 'place of love' or concern, but its more so the delivery than the actual concern. Adults belittling a child, especially in front of other kids and adults, is not okay. Snatching plates of food away from you is not okay, at any age. This is the kind of behavior that leads to disordered eating and body dysmorphia and self hate down the line. I went through all sorts of crash dieting, binge eating disorder, self harm. For a period in high school, I would wake up at 6am to exercise before school and only have one apple to eat the whole day- and my family praised me for looking thinner, treated me like I was worth more at a lower weight. Obviously that lifestyle wasnt sustainable and I gained the weight back, which made the commenting come back and reinforced that it didn't matter how unsafe I was being, just as long as I was skinny. \n\nAll this to say your feelings matter, what your parents did wasn't something harmless and insignificant. It's something that'll likely stick with you the rest of your life, and they don't deserve an apology from you. You deserve an apology from them. Obviously they can't go back and change what they've done but they need to understand that it wasn't okay, don't let them gaslight you into thinking you're making a big deal out of nothing or that you're holding onto something from years ago.

The only reason I've made it so far in my healing journey and made it to 25 years old (when I didn't plan to live past 18) was because I cut them out. They are a threat to your happiness, content with self, and overall safety (especially mental safety), and you deserve better. Disowning my moms side of the family (they were all threats to my happiness) was the best decision I'd made as an adult and you deserve that. If you wanna keep your siblings and cousins in your life, that's perfectly okay, but set firm boundaries (if you decide to cut off your parents) and make sure that they fully understand that their position in your life also stands on the foundation that they respect the decisions you make to be in a better place.\n\nAlso, I agree with another commenter that you should avoid being alone with them.

At this point they would rather have you thin and dead than fat and alive. And you're probably not fat. 4-5kg more than one norm ? Who dictated the norm ? Who said that it's prettier to be thin ?

No. It's them who need to apologize, but don't hold your breath. Also don't be surprised that, after all this time they are coming to see you because they want something. When they first contacted you, the first thing they did was to try and guilt you; to make themselves the victim.

It's not exclusively for those raised by alcoholics, but also those of us who grew up in less-than-healthy households. You might find some resources to help you process your feelings and decide how to proceed.", "You are definitely NTA. That is how you feel and they seem to be the AH for treating you so much differently. You are better without them.", "NTA, I had the same issue and what\u2019s wrong with parents now in days is that they never realize the damage they do. I constantly apologize to my kids, cause us parents do make mistakes. They kind of sound like a narcissist also, maybe they don\u2019t mean too. But narcissists never see the wrong they do, and they make themselves the victims. Non narcissists parents are open to any conversation, like I tell my girls that if I do something they don\u2019t like to please tell me and I\u2019ll do what I can to fix it. The fact that your parents can\u2019t even see the mistakes they did, worries me a lot. They cannot be perfect patty, so until then they should apologize for something.\n\nAdd on: I saw your comment about how people just don\u2019t know how to be affectionate. I was never shown affection too but I taught myself. You cannot change what you don\u2019t acknowledge, that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s like Alcohol Anonymous, they can\u2019t fix the issue until they realize that they have an addiction. They can\u2019t give affection because they see nothing wrong with not showing it. To end this,  DO NOT APOLOGIZE!!! If you apologize they will most definitely never see their wrong doings, if you do all you are doing is validating that they were right. By the way, they are your parents\u2026I don\u2019t care if my kids are 40 years old, I would still helped them. It\u2019s our job as parents!", "It sounds like your parents weren't the best.  They body shamed you. They didn't hug you enough.  But before you permanently damage your relationship with them you might want to make a list of the good things they did as well.
