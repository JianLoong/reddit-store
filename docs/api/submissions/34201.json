I think it would\u2019ve been best to let go it go, having her over and her husband just to kind of rub your point in her face doesn\u2019t feel right to have done\u2026I know she laid out the challenge but I think it was just a sensitive spot for her and it got turned into something hurtful when it was just supposed to be lighthearted \u2026I\u2019d say talk to her and apologize and maybe even suggest spending some time in the kitchen together; take the negative narrative and turn it into a positive one and maybe give her advice in the kitchen instead of just roasting her but this is just my opinion!", "ESH\n\nI can't really judge how awful her cooking is, but c'mon be a bit more kind to her. She invested all that time just to hear that that \"you aren't a fan.\" That's rude. How about you give her some useful criticism instead and tell her what you would prefer/change?\n\nAnd she kinda sucks for going back on her bet and embarrassing herself in front of her husband. Also, her husband's comment is really mean, so I hope that they joke like this all the time. But because your sister cried, I'm assuming that's not a usual joke / something that hurts her and makes her insecure.\n\nto conclude: be kind to each other ffs.\n\n\nedit to add: I feel like her bet was some sort of defense. Y'all seem to kinda play on her insecurities. Though that might be too far fetched because of lacking info.", "ESH\n\nSister shouldn\u2019t have brought up a bet if she wasn\u2019t going to pay up, however she probably only made the claim because you were talking trash about her cooking. As a general rule, if someone who loves you is cooking you food, don\u2019t say anything bad about it unless it\u2019s constructive.\n\nI\u2019m also curious if when you invited them to dinner, it was clear that it was part of the bet. Sounds like you embarrassed her intentionally in front of her husband and then rubbed salt on the wound by telling her to pay up. \n\nFinal thought: turkey is a notoriously dry dish to make. If you were really going to bet on something, I would have bet that you could make a better turkey. Of course tandoori chicken was better than turkey.", "YTA.", "I don't think you did anything out of the ordinary, your sister just embarrassed herself in front of her husband after saying \"fuck you\" to you in that manner. And the crying part, I don't get it, I never really understood women.", "NTA, she took a bet, maybe she was joking but she should have clarified. Don\u2019t bet more than you can pay. Although this time I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the money, it\u2019s her ego. She still shouldn\u2019t have made the bet if her ego can\u2019t take the hit of her brother possibly making better food than her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
