I don\u2019t give a crap if he\u2019s 78, you can bet if you were 99 he\u2019d still expect you to care for him when he\u2019s ill. You can also bet he\u2019s never done much to look after you when you\u2019re sick, even when he was much younger.  He\u2019s doing a shit job, not even the bare minimum. And I think we all know any time he\u2019s been sick over the years you probably did everything to meet his needs, comforting him, getting meds he might need, cooking for him, making sure he\u2019s comfortable etc etc. \n\nAt this point there\u2019s not much you can do about him, but make sure you do everything you can to care for yourself.

Thank you.\"\n\nYou need assistance right now. He is not giving it. So you need to tell him exactl what to do. It's sad because you shouldn't have to. But this is an emergency. Do it anyway.\n\nI hope you get well soon.", "NTA. There's a clear difference between what he considers \"taking care of you\" and what you actually need.

Does this crap go on all our lives until we die ???", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of age, his lack of care is callous, or at the very least naive and unsupportive.\n\nTaking both your ages in to account, I would (respectfully) suggest that he has no idea what you two are in for the long haul.\n\nIf he can't (or won't) take care of you now, how is he going to help you bathe yourself? Go to the toilet? Get out of bed if you can't manage to yourself?\n\nAs a granddaughter to a fierce grandmother who has all her faculties, but who requires physical aid, it is HARD WORK.\n\nYour significant other can not magic away any illness you have.

I needed help with everything. \n\nNot only was I recovering from surgery but my husband was sick. He had a cold or the flu or something. Our dog had a stomach bug and needed boiled chicken and rice. This man was sick himself and was not only making his own food, my food, and the dog\u2019s food, but he was cleaning everything up afterward too. He did *everything.* Despite how awful he felt, he took care of me and the dog before himself. \n\nYour husband should have actually taken care of you.

My MIL was 80 when she spent three night (not) sleeping in a very uncomfortable chair by my FIL's bed at the hospital, taking care of his every need. She needed to take a shower and rest but he wouldn't let her go, \"please, don't leave me alone\". When she was admitted to the hospital, six months later, he went once in a week to the hospital and stayed there for two hours, which is less than some cousins, because \"he doesn't know to help and feels frustrated\".\n\nThis is weaponized incompetence and men have be using it against us for ages.", "Please, take care of yourself.

I think the other comments have made clear that his \"taking care\" is not enough.\n\nI just wanted to add that even when you are vaccinated you can have Covid and you sound very sick. Because of how you feel and your age I would try getting your husband to get you a test. Now advice here because most people get this wrong: Swap your throat (not mouth!) and then inside both nose holes - not the tip but the back of the nose. Deep. If you are positive and it's not been 5 days you can still try Paxlovid. You don't sound good and I am devastated that your husband is not seeing that. Please watch your oxygen. Get well soon!", "NTA. Speak up and tell him what you need him to do for you.", "Whoa! NTA first of all, BUT...did you ask for specific things? Tell him what you need. Be needy.

Did he give you medication at regular intervals to get better? Did he bring you soup to keep your strength up? And if he did, did he leave it within arms reach for you? Looking after someone when they are ill involves more than just popping your head around the door. When my husband has a migraine, I will sit with him in silence holding his hand, and making sure he's taken some pain relief. When I had a 3 day concussion, he dealt with the kids and brought food up to me, made sure I took something for the pain. When my husband came in on the brink of hypothermia after snow gritting, I put him in a warm bath, put him to bed and i stripped down and got in the bed too so he could share my body heat. My husband ditched work to rush home and take me to the hospital after I dislocated my knee, he carried me out to the car and laid me across the back seats.\n\nYou are right to feel pissed off for your husband not doing the bare minimum, it doesn't take all day to ring a doctor, it doesn't take 3 hours to get you a juice. I understand he's in his 70s but if he was that worried about you he would make sure you're ok and have everything you need, and ring an ambulance if he thinks you're getting worse. Even something as basic as checking you for temperature would be more than what he's doing right now.", "Sounds like a boomer male\u2026.", "NTA. He sounds deliberately cruel.", "Info:\n\nI am genuinely sorry you are sick and dealing with a lack of care - I don\u2019t want that for anyone.\n\nis this new behavior for your husband? If no, He clearly has gotten away with it for 30 years, why are you expecting him to suddenly change? I realize you\u2019d think the sight of a seriously ill spouse would shock someone into care, but he seems careless. Is he on meds and losing time in general? Because if these are symptoms he has then something is going on with him. If he went to get juice and lost two hours of time, he may have thought it was right away. \n\nIf he has never had to care for a person, it can be weird. If you cared for kids or never get sick, he never built those skills. If he can\u2019t write down notes on a paper or refuses to, it\u2019s probably because he can\u2019t hear the words to write down. \n\n\nIf it is new, Your husband has a hearing problem and potentially time loss. He can\u2019t remember if you ate - does he remember to feed himself? I am really concerned he is experiencing something associated with old age. Get him a hearing aid and see communication improve. He also may not hear/see/feel the phone, which could be other symptoms. \n\nI hope you get care. I recommend calling in someone else or getting to the hospital for fluids.", "NTA. \n\nPlease make sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself.

I was too sick to say I needed help. I eventually had to ask for pain relief and help, the heating on and a fizzy drink for my throat. He did however run the household for the whole week in terms of childcare, housework and errands.

I'm leaning toward ESH.\n\nMy wife had several surgeries over the course of about a 10 year timespan, including shoulder, back, both wrists, knee, foot, and hip. Obviously, these surgeries included recovery time that lasted several days each. She has RA, which was the reason for some of them, and made some of the recovery times a bit difficult. There were pain meds to be given, meals to be made, and general assistance with things like bathing or dressing. I'm not a professional caregiver at all, but I wanted to ensure her needs were addressed. If she was resting or sleeping, I would look in on her about every hour or so. If she was awake when I checked on her, I'd ask her if she needed anything and how she was feeling. Sometimes, I'd offer to get her something or just sit and talk with her for a bit.\n\nBut, as you've said, that's not quite enough. It's important to respond to the needs of the person recovering, which is where you have a responsibility to *tell him how you're feeling.* If you don't communicate how you feel, what you're experiencing, what you need and when you need it, he's not going to read your mind. You can't expect him to know what you don't tell him. On the other end, he absolutely should be doing more, but we're getting the story from your side, so we don't know how factual it is. For example, you said you asked him for juice, and he brought you \"a small glass a few hours later.\" You said you were feverish, so maybe it only seemed like it was hours later. And when you say he \"left it on the other side of the room,\" I highly doubt he would set it down somewhere you couldn't get to it. Nobody is *that* rude or stupid. Again, being feverish can exaggerate a situation and make it seem different. \n\nI'm not saying either of you are to blame, but I'm leaning toward saying ESH because it seems like there's no communication between the two of you.
