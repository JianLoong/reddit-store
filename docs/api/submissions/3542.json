My husband and I have 2 kids, Leo and Mia (M15, F11). My brother and his wife have 2 kids, Ian and Aria (M13 and F11). My sister and her husband have 3 kids, Summer, Cadyn and Chase (F16, M14, M11). \n\nThe cruise had many fun moments, but there was also quite a bit of fighting, the majority of which was caused by Chase. I love my nephew, I really do but it\u2019s hard denying Chase has become a horrible person. Chase is a massive bully, his most recent incident getting trouble in school happened a few weeks ago, where him and a friend were caught saying racist slurs to other classmates. Chase is also in the 5th grade still because he was held back last year after failing due to lack of completing assignments. While I love my sister as well, the way she and her husband are parenting Chase is destructive. Whenever he does something bad, they \u201ctalk to him about why it was wrong\u201d and don\u2019t do anything else. I have never seen Chase show any form of remorse or regret for his actions.\n\nThe bad behavior for Chase started pretty quickly, at dinner on the first night of the cruise, he was extremely rude to our waiter, demanding the food come out faster and getting mad when others got their food first. After dinner, all the kids went to the arcade on the ship, when they came back, a few of the kids were saying Chase was being mean to other kids in the room. \n\nChase and Cadyn have a rocky relationship, and the meanest thing Chase did was to Cadyn. Cadyn is a good kid, loves sports, especially baseball and lacrosse. Our family is all atheists, this is also true for Cadyn\u2019s dad\u2019s side of the family as well, but Cadyn has become religious in the past few years. Sports played a big role in him becoming religious/Christian, Cadyn is a good kid and never uses his religion to hurt others and doesn\u2019t hate non-believers. Cadyn wears a necklace everyday that is like a cross necklace but incorporates baseball into the design, like a necklace made for Christian baseball fans. While Cadyn was showering, Chase thought it would be funny to steal it. Cadyn gets out of the shower and freaks out about not finding it until Summer sees Chase with the necklace and gives it to him. \n\nWe celebrate Christmas every year by going to my parent\u2019s house for breakfast, where they give them gifts, and then dinner at my house where we do secret Santa. When we got home, after seeing Chase\u2019s behavior, I told him and his parents that until he wrote a letter apologizing about his behavior to staff, bullying in the arcade, and making his own separate note to Cayden, that he was not allowed at my house on Christmas. His parents said I was \u201coverreacting\u201d to Chase\u2019s behavior, and my parents agreed with that notion. However, my husband thinks I\u2019m not, and Cadyn has said he hasn\u2019t forgiven Chase.

I can see the sibs and cousins going no contact one day.", "NTA\n\nAction have consequences and it looks like Chase is about to learn it.\n\nI would put my foot down on this, absolutely. It's your house, then you can establish rules for access.", "NTA. He never as any consecuence for his actions, this as to start in some poin, or he is gonna be wors. \nYou don't want that kind of person near your kids, dont matther if is family or not and if this is not enought, its your House and you chose Who go inside.", "ESH. Her way more than you though. His parents need to be better parents. You are absolutely in the right for setting boundaries and not allowing further interaction until your sister understands what needs to happen with her son. But, requiring this letter between two kids who aren\u2019t yours, is an overstep of parenting imo. If you asked for him to write one to you or your child, that would be a different story.", "Meh.\n\nESH. \n\nYeah, your sister is making crappy parenting decisions,  but they're HER decisions.  And banning her 11 year old from your home will inevitably be a de facto ban to her, her husband and their other children. Because no half-decent parent is going to leave their kid alone on Christmas.\n\nTake a close look at your relationships with your family, and make sure whether this is the hill you want to die on. Because it will break relationships", "Tell them no rotten apples a Christmas. That means Chase.", "Nta an apology letter is hardly over reacting. Of course when their action is nothing, it might seem like a lot.", "NTA - but\u2026 the apology letter is going to be disingenuous because the child doesnt think his behavior is wrong and he doesn\u2019t care about the ramifications of his behavior.\n\nI would suggest you take a different approach.  The conduct of chase that you describe is all centered around what he does to torment his siblings and outsiders.  It is not your responsibility to police his conduct and determine consequences for that behavior because he is their child not yours.  HOWEVER, when chase and his family comes to YOUR house, you are perfectly within your rights to list the code of conduct for your house and the consequences for breaking the rules in your house.\n\nEven if you get an apology letter, the kid isn\u2019t going to mean it, he is just going to do it because his parents told him to do it.  His parents have never enforced consequences for his bad behavior, and he is a child who needs consequences.  Without consequences his behavior is going to escalate.  But that is their problem not yours.  Your nephew sounds a lot like my brother.  My parents raised the three of us the same, the problem was that my parents only had to yell or admonish my sister and I and we would immediately self correct because we were embarrassed to be called out.  My brother didn\u2019t care.  That didn\u2019t cause him angst, he would just lie.  So his bad behavior escalated because my parents would bail him out and admonish him and explain what was wrong, but he didn\u2019t care, he would yes them to death and then do what he wanted.  He is a prescription drug addict and alcoholic, who has alienated literally everyone in his life except our sister because she is an empath and feels sorry for him.  His children don\u2019t speak to him, he has never met his grandchildren.  That\u2019s the path that your nephew is on, because what worked for the older two kids doesn\u2019t work for him.  Until he faces real consequences for his behavior, consequences that cause him personal angst or pain, he isn\u2019t going to change his behavior.  And even then he may not change.  My brother (in his 50\u2019s)hasn\u2019t changed, he just thinks it\u2019s the world out to get him\u2026\n\nYou can point out that the lack of consequences is rewarding bad behavior and so they get more bad behavior.  But his parents aren\u2019t likely to listen.  This is something that they need to come to realize, and it will be pretty embarrassing for them when they do.  My dad realized a few years before he died but it was too late at that point.\n\nYou can realistically only enforce rules for behavior in your house and behavior towards your children.  If the rules are broken, then you can ask them to leave.  However, since the child is 11, it\u2019s probably a package deal, you get all of them or none of them.  Your parents will then have to choose between dinner with you and dinner with them.\n\nSo what do you plan to do if he writes the letter, yet behaves badly?  What will you do if he doesn\u2019t write the letter?  Are you willing to let the family blow up over this and have separate dinners?\n\nI hope it works out for you.", "NTA - Chase's parents and grandparents are letting him go down a road that is going to land him in some very bad places.  Props for standing your ground and protecting your son.  No one wants to put up with a bullying jerk during the holidays, vacations or any other times.

Requiring an apology letter to people that will never see it does absolutely nothing and is no different than having a talking to with him about why his behavior is wrong.  You do realize apology letters will mean nothing to this child and it is a worthless demand.

This is our last dinner.  The onus is on the parents & that's whose lap you should throw it into.  The kid has sh*t judgement and no empathy, so don't rely on him to come to his senses.  He also has a superiority complex.  I doubt your opinions matter much to him & he probably will shrug you & your wishes off.  If you really want him to change behavior talk to your sister (brother?  sorry, i have really terrible short term memory) about it.

I think the best you can do is enforce your own house rules while your nephew is visiting and expect your siblings to support it.  And I\u2019d make it very clear to your nephew that if mistreats someone, he\u2019ll be spending the holidays by himself in a timeout in the basement laundry room until he is ready to apologize and respectful, etc, etc.  best case scenario, he learns that he has to behave at your house and maybe his parents realize the need to step up?", "NTA.

He'll stop getting invites to go to people's houses and eventually he'll have no friends. He'll be excluded from university options due to his behaviour,  and if he attempts work he will lose one job after another because he never learned how to behave properly and his co workers and bosses will not put up with that. \n\nHe needs to learn now that there are consequences for his shitty actions before he ends up in the real world with people who have zero reason or obligation to put up with his shit.\n\nI often wonder when I meet people who are poorly behaved, rude and entitled, openly bigoted, how they came to think it was alright to act like that. 100% from people like Chase's parents.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to correct Chase\u2019s behaviour and you\u2019re getting him to apologize about things he has primarily seem to have done to other people.

Chase needs real intervention and help here and would be better served by a frank discussion with your sister about your concerns.", "This kids on a fast track to eventually becoming the teen that hits his girlfriend.", "ESH.\n\nFirst, none of your children were involved in the situation you're describing.\n\nYou are saying that you didn't like the way your sister handled how her youngest kid harassed  her middle kid. And so you are banning the youngest kid from extended family gatherings at uncle's house until your sister does the punishment for her kid that you've decided on, even though none of your kids are involved in this at all.\n\nThat's...way overstepping. In the end, your sister is going to be the one to arbitrate disagreements between two of her own children the way she decides to. Not the way random uncle thinks should happen. You have no dog in this fight. Cadyn isn't your kid. Chase isn't your kid. Not even Summer is your kid. Your sister is the one who decides how to parent her kid. You may not approve, but that doesn't mean you get to force her to do it your way. And if you try, you are just going to alienate everyone in the family. Your the uncle, not the coparent.\n\nAlso, the kid is 11. You're acting like it's time to give up on him. Yes, he's doing crappy things. All kids do crappy things. All kids go through bad stages that, left unchecked, will leave them with critical character flaws. Cutting the kid off isn't really going to help with that. Trying to force your sister to do the punishment that you've decided on in this particular instance also isn't going to help with that.\n\nI think you're just frustrated to see them letting all this slide. That can be the conversation - but you should be having it with the parent, your sister. You can express that you are concerned about how Chase is acting out. You can suggest she look into counseling for him or the family. You can bring up solutions if she vents to you - once. But if you try to force your sister to do this note thing because you don't agree with how she handled a fight between 2 of her kids, they are going to get pissed and not come and then you will lose whatever influence you could use to help the situation out. Go ahead and watch the kids like a hawk, and correct in cases where you have the standing to do so - like when your kids are involved. Once your kid is involved, it's okay to correct that. But if they aren't involved, I won't directly punish kids when they are misbehaving at family things, but I will totally be like \"Mom of spawn x, get over here\" in a tone that shows I expect her to take care of the stuff her kid is doing. If you see him bothering waiters, it's okay to get your sister' attention, look at her son, and tell her \"really?\" Remind her that she needs to parent, but don't demand that she do it exactly the way you've decided she should, because that is a fight you will not win.", "I absolutely agree with everything you have said here. It\u2019s not up to OP to parent him and a disingenuous letter of apology isn\u2019t going to solve anything. Taking the words the Buttercup has said here and telling her sibling that Chase needs stronger behavioural interventions because things will only get worst."]}
