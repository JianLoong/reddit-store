For her birthday, about 3 months ago, all she wanted was a dog. \n\nI don\u2019t mind pets but I never really wanted any in my house. My daughter has always begged to get a dog or a cat and up until this point I have said no. \n\nThis time I really thought about it. She is a good kid and I figured since she was turning 16 she was mature enough to take care of it. \n\nI agreed to get her a dog but I made plenty of rules. The main rule being that she was the one who would take care of the dog. Feeding, walking and taking it outside. \n\nShe was very happy about this and we went to a local shelter. We ended up adopting a small mixed breed dog who is quite friendly and overall well behaved. \n\nWe all grew very attached to the dog, I have a 10 year old son as well and he instantly fell in love with him. \n\nEverything was going well for a month. Eventually the dog started peeing & pooping in the house. I would text my daughter about this asking if she took him outside and she would say she forgot. \n\nSince she was at school I was the one who had to clean up the poo. This happened maybe 4 times. Each time I lectured my daughter about taking care of her dog. I made a point to emphasize that it was HER dog and she was responsible for him. \n\nThere were also quite a few times where my daughter texted me from school saying she forgot to feed the dog and asking me to. \n\nOn Friday she went to school as usual. I walked past her room at some point and the door was closed, I heard the dog barking from inside the room. I let him out and texted her what happened. \n\nShe said he must have been in there and she closed the door without realizing it. The dog was fine, he was only in there for about 3 hours but I asked her what would have happened if I didn\u2019t hear the dog. He would have been in there all day without water or food. \n\nI was very annoyed since I never wanted any pets. I made a heat of the moment decision to get rid of the dog. I called my sister, who lives 10 minutes away and loves dogs. I asked her if she would take the dog and I also said it may be temporary if my daughter can prove that she\u2019s ready to actually care for him. \n\nMy sister happily agreed and I brought him to her house before work. Of course I intend to take my kids to visit the dog, but I am done taking care of him when it\u2019s supposed to be my daughter. I also feel the dog will be better cared for at my sisters house. \n\nI explained this to the kids who were extremely upset with me. Both of my kids started crying and my daughter stormed off to her room. All weekend she has been extra mouthy to me and my son has been moping around. \n\nI feel bad for my son who is very close to the dog and didn\u2019t do anything to deserve him being taken away. I do feel bad for my daughter as well but she broke our agreement.

But you made a decision to get a dog for your family because your daughter wanted one. You should have educated yourself in caring for the dog first and made a plan with your daughter about the dog\u2019s needs. \n\nNews flash, if she can\u2019t even be bothered to take the dog out once a day or make sure it\u2019s fed according to its diet plan and schedule, she has no business owning a dog. \n\nBut as the parent, you had no business getting an innocent dog to placate your daughter without thoroughly teaching her how to care for it. \n\nHumans are so careless with the lives of others and you both have shown that you should not own a dog together. Hopefully your sister loves and cares for that pooch, please don\u2019t ask for it back. \n\nYour daughter can try to get a dog when she\u2019s an adult and can handle caring for it and maintain the responsibility of ownership, but because you don\u2019t want to take any parenting action regarding the caring of animals as pets, you should never bring another pet into your home again.", "You never get pets for kids, you get them because you want them. At least your sister loves the dog, but you  should not have gotten one unless you were willing to care for it!", "NTA\n\n\nI may get down voted for this, but the poor dog was being continually mistreated. No dog deserves that. It was starved and deprived of exercise regularly. Not ok. At 16 your daughter should've been capable of taking care of the dog. She didn't do it. She doesnt get a dog. \n\n\nBuy her a dog sized stuffed toy as a replacement. She can mistreat that as much as she likes.", "only nta bc it went to your sister. I came here ready to tear you apart waiting for you to say you dumped it or took it to the shelter. \n\nMaybe your son can start learning the responsibility of a pet with some more low impact like a goldfish, bc it does stink that he's kind of getting punished for this", "A pet is a huge responsibility even for grown adults, it was a little unfair of you to expect a 16 year old to accept full responsibility for a pet. \n\nDid you help prepare her in any way? Come with feeding or walking schedules? Figure out what to do when she\u2019s at school can\u2019t let the dog out? Obedience classes? Vet appointments? Sounds like she needs help managing this new responsibility. As a parent, it\u2019s your job to teach her and guide her through it. You can\u2019t just throw this at her and expect her to succeed right away. \n\nRather than making a heat of the moment decision and rehoming the dog you should have sat down with her and discussed ways you could help her navigate this responsibility. YTA.", "NTA. She was neglecting the dog. At 16 she's old enough to know responsibility. \n\nShe doesn't get to be bent out of shape when she's the one who's not paying attention. \n\nIt's almost as if she wanted a Plush Toy that could move around and be loved but nothing else.", "YTA.\n\nJust seems like an odd decision to bring a dog in the house with a firm stipulation that a single member of the family be the only one to take care of it. \n\nAlso, I would think par for the, \u201c16 year old taking care of a dog\u201d course would involve a few slip ups similar to what you\u2019ve spoken of. Sending the dog off for what should have been your expectation in the first place feels unfair to the family and the dog.", "Soft YTD\n\nYour daughter was wrong for neglecting her duties to the dog, obviously. However, \u201cheat of the moment\u201d is not how you decide to rehome a pet; I think it would have been fairer (both to your daughter and to the dog) to have had a serious one-on-one conversation with your daughter and given her an ultimatum: either take care of the dog as we agreed or we\u2019ll have to find him another home. Maybe she would have stepped up seeing you were at your breaking point, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 but I think she deserved another chance. Pets aren\u2019t toys, and we grow to love them deeply.\n\nIt\u2019s not that bad since you gave him to your sister, who like you said lives nearby, and I\u2019m assuming the kids would be allowed to visit the dog? I also like how mentioned the move might be a temporary solution until your daughter grows up a bit. But, may I just say, please be careful with moving the dog around like that; if he stays at your sister\u2019s for a long time he will undoubtedly start to see it as his home, and just moving him again would be cruel.", "YTA. I understand your daughter\u2019s responsibility was to take care of the dog. But why bring the dog in the house in the first place if you knew this outcome was a possibility?? Also, dogs sometimes have to go outside multiple times a day depending on the size/breed. You mentioned it\u2019s a smaller breed, which means they normally need to use the bathroom more frequently. If your daughter goes to school, who was gonna let the dog out while she\u2019s at school for 8 hours even if she remembered to take the dog out in the morning? Also, she\u2019s 16. She\u2019s not a fully grown adult. She\u2019s going to mess up and forget sometimes. To just take her pet to another house 1.) without warning and 2.) without a prior discussion about the repercussions is definitely too much.", "YTA for a very, very simple reason: you didn't really want a pet in your house ... *so you never should have gotten one*. Period, end of story. Although you made sure the dog is in a better home now what you did was **cruel** to him, and you're saying you *might* bring him back \"if\" your teen shows she can do better? Um, NO. Leave the dog with your sister and cope with your angry daughter and hurting son, because it isn't remotely fair to the dog to treat him like he's a yo-yo. He doesn't understand why you sent him away, and by the time your teen improves he'll have adjusted to being at your sisters only to have his security upended *again.*  That's so wrong! Have some respect for a fellow living being and leave him there, where he can feel safe, loved, and *wanted*, and just take the kids to visit from time to time.", "YTA for getting a dog with unreasonable expectations. I feel bad for the dog and your son.", "NTA.  Every step you've made seems perfectly reasonable. Your daughter is at the age where she can start learning that shirking responsibilities often has conequences, and you gave her plenty of chances.", "NTA. you gave her responsibility and she didn't put up her end of the bargain.", "NTA.\n\nYou had rules, she clearly wasn't ready for a pet, maybe a dog was too much too fast. I guess you maybe could've given her an ultimatum before actually sending the dog to your sister but there's no guarantee the shift in attitude wouldn't have just been temporary.", "It sounds like you're not ready for the responsibility, why isn't this dog crated /crate trained, no mention of fenced in yard or doggie door either.... You can't let a new pet just roam your house and expect it not the bathroom while trapped inside for hours and hours.\n\n I don't believe you gave your daughter the tools to succeed, you going straight to punishment instead of learning opportunity. \n\nYou shouldn't have agreed to the dog if you can't accept a couple slip ups in the first few months of owning a new pet.  You're in the wrong here, lighten up and go get the dog back, now! YTA", "YTA Your daughter is a teenager. While she is capable of having some responsibility for the dog, it isn\u2019t reasonable or realistic to expect her to do 100% of it. As the adult in this situation you should\u2019ve realized this and managed your expectations. I understand she needs to keep up with some responsibilities and her forgetting some things would warrant a further discussion or consequences. It was very cruel to give their dog away without notice, or time to say goodbye. \nIt does not sound there were too many instances of her forgetting some care needs. Did you use this as an excuse to get rid of the dog because you never really wanted it?", "YTA. yeah, your daughter should've done better but you're the responsible adult in the situation and a pet is a commitment for life. You don't just give a dog away to teach a kid a lesson; your poor 10yo, this poor dog.", "ESH. When a family agrees to get a dog it\u2019s a family responsibility to take care of the dog and not just one person.  Taking care of a dog when you\u2019ve never had that responsibility is like taking care of a baby for the first time.  At 16, your daughter should be able to handle some of it but don\u2019t expect her to handle all of it.  I see and hear of far to many situations like yours that get a puppy or dog from the animal shelter or a breeder for the first time and expect that animal to just automatically do what you want it to do, and also give that responsibility to a child that\u2019s far too young to handle that responsibility.  When it doesn\u2019t work out, the poor dog is given away.  It takes several months for a dog to get comfortable with its new surroundings.  A dog is a lifetime commitment for all involved.  \n\nI\u2019ve been a dog owner since I was a child.  My parents got me my first dog at 6 years old.  They also wanted a dog in the house.  Never at any time when I was growing up did my parents expect me to take full responsibility for the dogs we owned.  I started doing it when I was old enough to do this on my own.  I currently own 3 dogs.  All are happy and well cared for.  As an adult, I chose to except that responsibility.", "NTA- your daughter agreed to the terms and failed to uphold her end of the bargain.", "For me NTA went through a very similar thing with my son, the only difference was he was 18 almost 19 at the time. Lived with a family member for a few months and adopted a at the time 12/13 year old dog they didn't want and brought her with when he moved back in. \n\nWe went through the same cycle he'd lock her in his room, wouldn't give her water or food on a consistent schedule, he's overfeed or underfeed her despite having no job and all the free time in the world, let her pee and poop all over, refused to take her potty despite reminders, us asking or her even asking she has a subtle tell that says hey potty break to be told oh I forgot or she's already had an accident I'll do it in a minute only to find a pile of pee or poop where he refused to take her out when with constant reminders hours later \n\nWe put up with that for 6 months  when  we had no choice but to look after her  because he wasn't being responsible our home was being ruined by accidents and we were footing all the costs for her with promise of I'll pay you back to date we are in the thousands despite it only being under 3 years. We ended up being responsible for  monthly rent and pet deposi.  So we took over ownership the moment he tried to re-home her despite all the help, cost to us and time spend she thrived, barely had accidents save the odd one vs several a day she was having.  He tried once more with her about a year later blaming us as to why he failed as an owner when she stopped wanting him and then  failed again even with 2 different people helping while living  somewhere else he hit  6 months and decided he didn't want her anymore so we had to start from scratch all over again...\n\nI agree with others make your daughter prove she is responsible , everyone saying that it's your job to look after a pet is wrong, yes you can help look after that dog I.e feed, water, walk , train or  do potty runs when she is at school or at work  but the moment she is  home she should've followed the dogs every need after the first month or so.  You can't blame her age at 8-9 years old I was feeding our family dog every meal, did all the potty breaks outside, every groom she needed no matter the weather  when I was able to I'd do her walks but my disability didn't allow that often so my parents did longer walks for her on my behalf and they did buy her food and pay for her vaccinations, vet bills but most of the work was left to me minus the cost as I was a child. Once I worked I paid as much as they did for her cost  because I was the one who ultimately wanted a dog. She was loved by us all but I knew the minute I abdicated my duty's as her owner and human my parents had every right to decide whether she was mine, theirs on what to do with her if I chose not to be responsible. My parents of course helped but also reminded me of my promise/contract and I lived by that till her last breath almost 14 years later. \n\n  Yes it takes a family parhaos if she truly wants the dog back write up a contract give her x date to x date to follow all rules on dog ownership, with guidance and help from you as much as you don't want to she will need this. If she continues to fail I e potty runs,. Not feeding the dog r, locking it in a room repeatedly without food water for hours then as part of the contact send her back to your sister's permanently and say no more dogs/cats untill you move out. Stipulate your help in the contract i.e potty breaks or feed at xyZ time due to her school or your  work schedule, if it's  outside of those hours due to negligence on her part I e forgot to feed in morning or take the dog outside before/after school. there will be a mark against her that so many marks between start and end period will dictate on the date of your choosing  whether she will be allowed to continue ownership. Explain this is like a job probation any real job will be following her progress for a predetermined amount of tine to see if she is suitable for the job. That should be the same for the owning a dog, If she messes up constantly despite help, guidance on the same things of If flakes out again assuming you'll take over what she doesn't want to do constantly end the contract and say unfortunately she is to be rehomed at your sister's. Yes it's sad for your son but he will still be allowed to see the dog, or parhaps include him in their daily duties if daughter fails to meet the dogs needs explain to your son I was m willing to keep her if you step up and help with the dog. Sometimes it takes loosing their animal to change their ways, sometimes it woeks sometimes it doesn't I wish you luck", "NTA. Your daughter should have been apologetic, but instead got angry. This tells me she doesn\u2019t understand that the action you took was a consequence of her irresponsibility. She\u2019s not ready to take care of the dog.", "INFO: did you warn the daughter that if she didn\u2019t pull her weight, her dog would be given away?", "NTA\n\nFrankly I wouldn't have cleaned up the poo just because she was at school, make her do it as soon as she gets home, just like if she lived alone with a dog and it pooped while she was gone. Yeah it sucks you have to live with the poo for a couple hours but you're a grown adult, you can handle it.\n\nSimilarly, if there was some way to force your kid to take care of the dog even when it hadn't been fed, in some way that doesn't hurt the dog, I would have done that, too. Like show up to school with the dog and the dog's food and take your kid out of class to feed the dog. Doing that a couple times might have made your point.\n\nBut this works too.\n\nI will say, don't let this be the end of the story. Your daughter may have been responsible for the dog, but you're responsible for *her*. One of the life skills she needs is to be responsible enough to take care of a dog. If she still can't do that by the time she's 18, you failed to raise her right. You need to think of some opportunity for her (or for the son) to earn this dog back. Having your sister take the dog 'temporarily' was a stroke of genius.", "ESH, and you suck the most. A household with a dog becomes a pack. You as the parent being the pack leader setting the tone. You should have taught your children how to care for the dog. You should be setting an example of what needs to be done to care for the dog. Caring for the dog is everyone\u2019s responsibility. What would have happened if the dog needed to go to the vet? Did you expect your daughter to pay for it since it\u2019s her dog? \nSure, having a pet made your kids happy, but did you seriously expect not to lift a finger, and the second the dog becomes an annoyance and you actually have to do something for the living, breathing thing you get rid of it? Teach your children by example. \nTo the dog, it\u2019s owners are their entire world and all they know and love. \nPlease don\u2019t bring a pet into the family if you are not prepared to love and care for it along with your children for the duration of the pets life. It\u2019s a living breathing loving pooch, not a toy to be discarded just because it\u2019s inconvenient for you to feed it.", "YTA, but because of the type of animal.\n\nWhen you bring a pet, especially a dog, into a house, that\u2019s a family pet.  The dog belongs to everyone.  A 16 year old isn\u2019t responsible enough to take care of a dog completely on their own.  I would\u2019ve gone with a small animal, a rabbit, a hamster, etc.  Not a dog.", "NTA. I agree that I feel badly for your son, but your daughter wasn\u2019t taking care of the dog. Plain and simple. Frankly, it wasn\u2019t fair to the dog. He deserves to be treated properly and it wasn\u2019t like you abandoned jim in some way. You found him a great home with family. Hopefully she\u2019ll understand 1. What it means to care for an animal, and 2. That actions lead to consequences.", "soft YTA. You're still the adult and especially while your daughter is at school/studying there's a level of ownership that falls to you. If you didn't want to have any responsibility you really shouldn't have given in to her request. Also a pet like a dog becomes a family pet and therefore removing it is punishing everyone.

Also, a dog being in a room for a few hours will not be terrible (except for the carpet, the door, the bed, etc)", "YTA - how the hell are you going to expect a child to care for a dog when she\u2019s never had a dog so is clueless on what to do and you\u2019re not willing to teach her how to care for the dog?!?\n\nAlso WTF pets are not pawns, you can\u2019t just grab one and then change your mind. They\u2019re living breathing creatures.\n\nYou just took a dog who has probably had a traumatic life, gave it a home, and then ripped that home away.

For her birthday, about 3 months ago, all she wanted was a dog. \n\nI don\u2019t mind pets but I never really wanted any in my house. My daughter has always begged to get a dog or a cat and up until this point I have said no. \n\nThis time I really thought about it. She is a good kid and I figured since she was turning 16 she was mature enough to take care of it. \n\nI agreed to get her a dog but I made plenty of rules. The main rule being that she was the one who would take care of the dog. Feeding, walking and taking it outside. \n\nShe was very happy about this and we went to a local shelter. We ended up adopting a small mixed breed dog who is quite friendly and overall well behaved. \n\nWe all grew very attached to the dog, I have a 10 year old son as well and he instantly fell in love with him. \n\nEverything was going well for a month. Eventually the dog started peeing & pooping in the house. I would text my daughter about this asking if she took him outside and she would say she forgot. \n\nSince she was at school I was the one who had to clean up the poo. This happened maybe 4 times. Each time I lectured my daughter about taking care of her dog. I made a point to emphasize that it was HER dog and she was responsible for him. \n\nThere were also quite a few times where my daughter texted me from school saying she forgot to feed the dog and asking me to. \n\nOn Friday she went to school as usual. I walked past her room at some point and the door was closed, I heard the dog barking from inside the room. I let him out and texted her what happened. \n\nShe said he must have been in there and she closed the door without realizing it. The dog was fine, he was only in there for about 3 hours but I asked her what would have happened if I didn\u2019t hear the dog. He would have been in there all day without water or food. \n\nI was very annoyed since I never wanted any pets. I made a heat of the moment decision to get rid of the dog. I called my sister, who lives 10 minutes away and loves dogs. I asked her if she would take the dog and I also said it may be temporary if my daughter can prove that she\u2019s ready to actually care for him. \n\nMy sister happily agreed and I brought him to her house before work. Of course I intend to take my kids to visit the dog, but I am done taking care of him when it\u2019s supposed to be my daughter.

The amount of work - training, walking, socializing, etc - that a dog requires is a true commitment of time and attention.  With a cat, as long as they have food, water, clean litter box, and cuddles when they demand them they're fine.  OP you should have done some research before you chose a pet for your family.  \n\nYTA", "Bwahahah YTA! Your daughter is in school all day, and it sounds like you\u2019re home?? We\u2019re you expecting your daughter to come home during the school day? OBVIOUSLY you were going to have to care for said dog\u2026", "YTA. What would you have done if you couldn't drop the dog off at your sister's? Also what do you mean \"it may be temporary if my daughter can prove that she\u2019s ready to actually care for him\"? If your daughter doesn't prove herself, are you taking that poor dog to the shelter?\n\nYou're the adult and you should have given careful consideration about having a dog. Never has the saying \"a dog is for life, not just for Christmas\" rang more true.\n\nAlthough your children may have begged for the dog, they clearly have a lot to learn still. However, it is unreasonable to expect the sole dog ownership and responsibility to rest solely on a 16yo. Children would often pay lip service to get exactly what they want. Unfortunately, a lot of the times it does fall to the parent to pick up the slack where their children had failed to be responsible and they always end up with the dog because you're meant to be the responsible one exercising moral judgement. Whether you like it or not, you are the ultimate owner of the dog, not your daughter until she demonstrates clear maturity.\n\nYou've also punished your younger son through his sister's immaturity. There are moral and ethical lessons you could have taught to your children about responsibility and the serious health consequences if they fail to take care of the dog. You can still do that, but taking the dog away is unnecessary cruel.", "YTA for bringing the dog home in the first place. A 16yo was never going to be 100% responsible for the dog\u2019s care. Your expectations were unrealistic.", "ESH\n\nNot for the whole punishment of not taking care of the dog, but the expectations that you put on only your daughter. If the whole family is bonding with the dog, then the whole family should care for it. It never made sense to me when parents would put the whole responsibility of a pet on a minor. Especially if the pet is going to be in a home with multiple family members. A dog is a big responsibility, and children make mistakes and forget all the time. You should have realized before getting the dog that there were going to be times that you would have to do something. A pet is a big commitment, and you shouldn't be getting one with the intention that a 16 year old will perfectly take care of the responsibilities all the time. Teenagers are basically meant to mess up.", "NTA. The fact that a lot of posters here don't think sixteen is old enough to care for a pet explains a lot about how irresponsible college  students are these days.", "YTA it's a living creature who loves and felt comfy around you and your family. You don't use a living creature as a lesson or punishment for kids.", "ESH except the dog, your sister, and son\n\nFor starters before even getting a dog you should have sat your daughter down and done your research together and figure out what kind of dog fits your lifestyle. Then it\u2019s not really fair for the care to land on one person, if anything the duties should have been divided up between at least your daughter and son. Of course with most of the work going to your daughter with your son picking up the slack. Either way it was wrong of you to get a dog when you didn\u2019t want one in the house then rehome it the first chance you got. Although at least the dog is in a more welcoming home.", "YTA.  Taking care of a pet properly on a daily basis takes practice and supervision and eventually it becomes a habit.  Your daughter just isn't there yet.  Kids who grow up with animals literally spend years learning how to care for them, under adult supervision, and they usually get reminded countless times to feed them and so on. \nIt's not reasonable for you to expect that level of care from your daughter so soon.  You set the kid up to fail.", "ESH.\n\nWe aren't born understanding how to care for animals and I think before going to the shelter to pick one up, she should have had to take dog care and training classes and maybe dogsit someone else's dog first to make sure it was right for her. I feel very bad for this shelter dog that is getting shuttled from home to home because people can't be bothered to put in the work to have one. Your daugher's laissez faire attitude toward the dog's safety is concerning and shows she isn't mature enough to be responsible for a living thing. Honestly though, I personally don't think minor kids should be given pets or be expected to be responsible for them at all. Kids are awful at understanding the amount of care that goes into having a pet.", "You should have warned her before you did that. Instead you blindsided her and your son. Now they're not going to trust you again anytime soon or ever. Your daughter should have done a lot more. But I think you're thrilled to be rid of the dog. I think you have no intention of bringing him back because you don't want a dog.", "YTA, you decided to get one, because your daughter wanted one. But you are the parent. You should have educated yourself first and made a plan with your daughter and telling her, what a big responsibility a dog is.\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t even gave them a warning, about giving her away. You made this heartless decision by yourself. If this is the way you want to raise your kids, then great way if you don\u2019t want your kids to speak to you ever again.", "As upsetting a thing as this is to do to your offspring, I agree that the dog also has needs and deserves to be properly cared for. I feel bad for your son too. But, before my kids could have a dog, we wrote a contract together about family management because the dog would be a new member of the family. It wasn't a \"Stick to the plan!\" issue to me so much as I needed them to appreciate the gravity of the decision to expand the family with a sentient being. But, they were ready to be what a dog needed. And your daughter hasn't demonstrated that. So, on the strength of her not adapting sufficiently? NTA. Its just something I feel sorry about for all concerned, but especially the dog and your son. Both innocent victims here.", "ESH. I would\u2019ve gone with NTA had this not been a heat of the moment decision and something you had spoke to your kids about as a possible option", "i\u2019m going against the grain a bit, YTA dude\n\nI agree 100% that your daughter needed to be responsible and take care of the dog. The reason i\u2019m not going E S H is because, while she is 16, she\u2019s never had a pet before. You just figured she could do it with no real experience with animals. You never sat down with her and asked if she did her research, made sure she understood the responsibilities and expectations of her owning and taking care of the dog. Making rules doesn\u2019t quite mean she\u2019s going to understand the amount of work animals are. \n\nThen you didn\u2019t help her make a plan for while she\u2019s at school. Puppies are not going to be potty trained as fast as any dog owner wants, and even if she wasn\u2019t forgetting to let the dog out (which she should get in trouble for) there\u2019s a high chance that the dog would\u2019ve pooped or peed in the house anyways. There\u2019s plenty of solutions if you work and no one\u2019s home to take care of the puppy.\n\nThe worst part, IMO, is that after they were all attached to the puppy, instead of sitting down with your daughter and having a conversation about her responsibilities and that she\u2019s been lacking in taking care of the dog, you decided to get rid of the poor thing. This not only affects the family but the dog too, and it\u2019s just sad. My dad did something similar, he just got rid of our guinea pig one day and i\u2019m still upset about it. So you\u2019re going to be feeling this rift for a while with your kids. \n\nSo yea, you\u2019re the asshole, you\u2019re the adult and you reacted in anger without thinking rather than communicating", "Yeah, making a pet the sole responsibility of the person who wants it never works out.  You are adding a member to your family, and you all have to behave as such.  ESH", "Something I don't understand here as well...the purported owner of the dog is 16. What are her plans after graduation regarding care for the dog? Not every kid magically leaves at 18 or whatever, not sure what kind of plans for further education or travel might be on the menu...\n\nBut usually a teenager is not going to be able to fully take care of a dog, and the dog will live for many years. I feel like this wasn't particularly well thought through...", "Her son does not suck, IMO.", "I'm an animallover. I've always had dogs, and at one point a cat. Pets should NEVER be given as gifts, unless the person giving it is willing and able to care for said pet during their entire life. I have never given my children pets as gift.

There are a lot of kids (and I think daughter is one of them) that are behind in terms of independence because of the way society treats them. Daughter never had to be responsible before and then was thrust into being responsible for a creature that requires a ton of work (especially the beginning)\n\nAlso never being around pets means that they wouldn't have a full understanding of the animals suffering. \n\nI really just have a lot of opinions about people raised away from animals.

So why are we expecting a 16 year old to know better than their parent.", "It's tough\n\nA pet? Sure! But probably not one that requires all that a dog truly requires. I've had pets my whole life and took care of them on my own. But they were the types of animals that go in a cage, you fill the bowl with food and they eat it over the course of a few days.\n\n \"Feed walk clean\" yes most children are surely capable of doing it .. but to do it alone involves remembering it needs to be done, figuring out what it means to execute it, and then ultimately getting it done. At 16, (but regardless of age) being unable to do the executive function part of thinking ahead means no pup for her. I'm sure daughter would do just fine taking care of the dog as long as OP is doing the reminding and the thinking.

Would you crawl through that fence to get a drink?\" I said no and he said, \"And that should tell you exactly how thirsty they were then. If you ever do this again, the goats are going to someone who actually gives a shit about them.\" I'll never forget it, I felt like a total fucking monster for causing those goats to get so thirsty and desperate they inflicted pain on themselves just to get a drink.
