{"id": 34200, "submission_id": "18wq1qn", "title": "AITA For buying my little brother too many gifts?", "selftext": "So me (23F) and my sister Jane (20F) are full sisters, and we have a little brother Elijah (8M) who has the same dad and different mum Hannah(45F). Our dad passed away 5 years ago.\n\nMy brother is my world, as is with my sister's as well, we look after him frequently for free and overall have been a huge part of his life, despite living separately. Hell, we even raised him most of the time when Hannah was sectioned for about a year, back when my dad was still alive.\n\nMe and my sister both earn very little money, so almost every single one of my brother's presents were second-hand or bought on sale, except for a \u00a345 lego set. Some of the second-hand presents were pyjamas, a guitar, craft sets and books, each being between \u00a32-\u00a320, the guitar being the most expensive at \u00a320. Overall we bought about 15-20 presents for him between us, totalling about \u00a3150 split between me and Jane.\n\nChristmas day came around and my brother seemed to enjoy everything and was very grateful for the gifts from everyone, he would thank us after every present and play with each of them.\n\nNow today my step-mum has contacted us saying she added up the money spent on gifts and believes we spent about \u00a3600 on all his gifts for Christmas, which is FAR off what we actually spent. Hannah says she doesn't want Elijah being spoilt and ungrateful by getting too many presents from us, not at all mentioning how she herself bought about double what we did.\n\nShe has told us \"Please in future please limit your spending to \u00a3100 max on Elijah's special occasions and that any item above this I will give back. Elijah is aware that I will not let him accept expensive items in the future and understands my reasons.\"\n\nMe and Jane are both massively pissed off. The spending I GET, but it seems hypocritical to want us to spend less, while spending double that herself. Not only that, but searching up every present each person has gotten Elijah and herself, and finding out the prices. It feels violating and invasive.\n\nI told her that I wouldn't dream of ever searching up how much her gifts to me cost, because of how invasive and rude it is, and how violated I feel that she has searched this up. Hannah pointed out that out of all the family members, we spent a lot more than our aunts and cousins. I was again offended, due to the fact we were put in the same group as our cousin and aunts. We aren't distant relatives, we are his sisters, we are her step-daughters.\n\nI feel like she's feeling overshadowed from us with the gifts, despite Santa getting Elijah the most anyway. I told her that if she feels defensive in her amount of gifts, give more next year and have Santa give less. Hannah also got Elijah an iPad for Christmas which probably cost more than all of our gifts combined.\n\nNow I've had time to think over it, am I just overreacting? Am I being too invasive to my little brother's life? Part of me thinks that maybe we did spend too much on his gifts, maybe we are too invasive with his life.

There is nothing wrong with buying gifts, but there is also nothing wrong with a parent being concerned that their child may become materialistic. \n\nI do think you're overreacting. She asked you to limit how much you spent on gifts. She didn't say anything about spending time with him or being in his life. I think you're a bit of an AH by equating gifts with being in his life. She never said anything about you being invasive. She just asked that you not buy so much or spend so much money on your brother.", "NTA. You and Jane showed love and care within your budget, which is thoughtful, not spoiling. Hannah's reaction, especially the spending limit and comparing gifts, seems unfair and a bit hypocritical considering her own gift-giving. It's important to have a calm conversation with her to discuss gift-giving boundaries that respect everyone's feelings and contributions. Your relationship with your brother is unique and your affection through gifts is natural, especially when done thoughtfully.", "I don't think you're the arsehole but I also don't think you perhaps understand Hannah's point. Hannah wants to set a limit so your brother doesn't become spoilt. Whether Hannah spends more money or not is not a fair comparison as she is his mother. \n\nIs perhaps Hannah also aware of how little you earn and could be concerned about you spending on your brother when you may need it for a rainy day?", "Although he is your brother, he\u2019s not your kid. The mom is definitely allowed to set boundaries on how many gifts you give him.", "Nta", "NTA. You are an awesome big brother! And your sisters are awesome too. Explain to stepmom that the gifts are bought on sale or 2nd hand, because you shop all year long for him.  (Which is the way to do it!).", "NAH\n\nYou and your sister want to dote on your 8yo brother.\n\nHowever, his mom is making sure he's not getting spoiled.  At the end of the day, she deals with him day in  and day out.  She may be more aware of his personality when the fun sisters aren't around.", "NTA\n\nYou and your sister are very involved in your brother's life in general. It is totally normal for that level of involvement to extend to buying Christmas gifts as well. It is entirely up to you to decide how much you can afford to spend and what you think will improve your relationship with your brother. It would be nice if you could mend your relationship with your step-mom, or at least remain cordial so that the disagreements don't further harm your brother. But regardless of what happens with her, your focus should still remain on your brother.", "NTA. I think his mum is very insecure about her own relationship with him, having been separated for a year, then losing her husband. She sounds jealous of the close relationship he has with you and your sister. Be involved in his life, help her out in looking after him, but try to keep it sisterly not motherly.", "NTA - Christmas is for kids and getting your little brother more gifts is fine and he seems like a great kid.  Your Stepmom however seems to have a jealous streak in her and that is why she id mad because maybe your are showing her up in her mind.  She either can't or won't get more gifts for him and that would be a her problem not a you problem.  Too bad for her.  Besides your brother and you two are more tied together by blood than she is.   You keep showing the love and support to your brother and tell her to take a hike.", "NAH. You WBTAH though if you go against Hannah\u2019s wishes, as at the end of the day she is his mother and gets the final say, regardless of how much you actually did spend.", "Nah. I understand you love your brother, but 15-20 gifts is extreme. His mom doesn\u2019t want him to become accustomed to that much material goods. And she\u2019s the one that has to deal with his behavior for the rest of the year. She calls the shots. Your reaction was overreacting.", "NTA - mothers can get jealous, either without knowing it or worse, willingly. We were poor growing up, large family and 2 of my sisters (older than me) took care of me and my brother. We were getting presents from them when my mother could not do the same. She would often make similar comments as described by OP\u2026", "NTA. Hannah seems to be focused on the quantity of gifts Elijah received instead of all the love for her son.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmother needs therapy.  Who does that?  Just let the kid be happy.", "Nta, she sounds bitter. I'm assuming that one or more of the gifts you got him, he plays with regularly. Which means either one or more of the expensive items she got him he doesn't play with. That's why she's being weird, bitter and emphisisng about how much money was spent  instead of the volume of presents. It is invasive of her and even though the parent has a right to set boundaries on gift giving, to claim its because of not wanting him \"spoilt\" sounds like she's upset her kid wasn't more \"greatful\" for the gifts she or her blood reletives gave.\n\nEspecially since she diminished your relationship with him by lumping you in with aunts and cousins.. your their sisters, and when you split the costs, you two didn't even individually hit her allocated budget. Plus she's claiming to of spent over 1k on her kid and then tell you guys you'd be the reason he would be \"spoilt if you carry on this way,\" super hypocritical of her I don't think I even spent \u00a3300 all together on my 2 kids who are close to your brothers age. \n\nThe questions I want to ask are:\n\nDoes she know that all except for the lego set is second hand? \n\nDid she also give the aunts and cousins and extended family an \u00a3100 limit? Cus that's a lot to expect others to spend on your kid in this economy. \n\nThe last question is did she seem to resent you or have a strained relationship with you both whilst growing up?\n\n I just feel like context would help me know if my assumptions are more plausible. Lol hell I'd straight up just ask your brother cus kids at that age don't have a reason not to tell you why.", "YTA\n\nYour stepmother is right.\n\nIt is not good for a child to get too many gifts.\n\nShe is the parent and she decides how many gifts a child gets.\n\nMy children got 2 gifts this year for xmas. One big item and one small.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She doesn't want her kid to equate love with gifts. She didn't say anything about them being in his life or doing things with him. She simply asked not to spend so much money on him.

Even if hannah is conflict avoidant, the way she comes across is demanding and presumptuous. Then maybe even a bit prideful and rude if she still digs her heels in after learning you didn't even spend as much as she first assumed.. if she didn't apologise for the assumtions then they do seem very prideful and used to a very \"my way or high way,\" type approach to discussions with someone of an apposing view.  But if she did apologise maybe shes noticed some behaviour in him at home you two dont get to see. Although without that knowledge I'm still sticking with the bitter analysis, if this was about spoiltness, she should be leading by example as a parent not being a hypocrite."]}
