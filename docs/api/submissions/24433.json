My uncles always explained that she had a disease and her leaving me with them was proof of her love for me.\n\nYou can imagine that my relationship with her has always been complicated, but I've always tried to understand that this is something that is out of her control. In the last months, she's been on a good streak again, stopping all that shit, she's moved in with a new boyfriend and he seems to be someone that wants to help her out. We don't see each other much but I try to call her at least every 15 days, and my parents always try to report to me about her improvements.\n\nHowever, last week, after a long time, she was the one that called me and asked me to go out. I tried not to get too excited because I already know what she's like, but at the same time, I was happy. When we met, she explained how her boyfriend has helped her to cut 100% contact with anyone who influences her to go back to addiction, and how she wants to be a better person. She even started therapy and went to rehab for a while. I said I was very happy and asked what finally motivated her to make that decision.\n\nAnd then she told me that he helped her but that the big motivator that gave her strength is that they decided to start a family and that she wanted to meet me in person to let me know that she is pregnant. She said she needed to be better, to be present, and that is what is helping her focus on recovery.\n\nIt hurt me, you know? That they were worth it, but I wasn't. I decided to leave before our lunch was even over and ignored all forms of contact from her thereafter. As people say, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.\n\nHowever, yesterday her boyfriend called me (I answered because I didn't have his number saved) and he started yelling at me, he said I was an asshole, that for him I would never have contact with his family, because apparently no one knows where my mom is and what hindered her improvement was my attitude. My grandparents are also angry with me and said that I am very irresponsible and that I didn't have emotional responsibility with someone very vulnerable.

Support is supposed to either go down (parent to child or older adult to younger adult), sometimes sideway (peer to peer or siblings about the same age or consenting adults like in dating or marriage), but not up.

This could mean the decision they made, in hindsight, wasn\u2019t the best decision, but they didn\u2019t know what they know now. Same with addiction.

Without ever apologizing that he hurt me. Because the addict in him HAD to always be in charge, and always decide how it went. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m frustrated he never got the balls to apologize for not respecting my boundaries, but not sad. I knew this was him, and I didn\u2019t expect anything different from him. He just continued to prove that.\n\nYou see, when I was 16, we went to rehab. He blamed me and my brother for all his problems. In the group session. Where he was supposed to be taking responsibility. I screamed at him. In front of everyone. I told him he needs to grow the fuck up. I walked out. I refused to come back. His counselors told him he was wrong, and I was right. \n\nThree years later, he was drinking again. At my college holiday party, when I was on a date, he got shit faced drunk. In front of ALL of my professors and classmates. I stopped him from drinking and driving\u2026 and he gave me bruises that night. He didn\u2019t believe me when I showed him the next day. He went back to rehab. He was sober since \u2014 but he never addressed his issues with some of his behaviors. He never tried to better himself. And honestly, he was narcissistic. He was one person in front of others, when they could praise him, but he was completely different for those who weren\u2019t. This is why, 16 years later, I went no contact.\n\nYour mom seems to be trying. Will she have it all figured out? No. Will she always be perfect? No. But at least she owned up and talked to you about this in person.\n\nI recommend you seek your own counselor.

I told her how much it hurt me, and the way it came across. I told her I knew she wasnt trying to be a dick, but that all that attention to my brother and not to me when I needed help was hurtful. \n\nOur relationship has actually transformed.

Sure, the addict in the most cases chose to start getting drugs, and during their life harms a lot of people beloved and strangers. And during therapy, motivation is tried to be enhanced and children are used to make a point. But trouth is that both the addict and the suicidal patient don't care for their own self preservation, and they are deeply ill. Many times the damage is so deep even myltiple medicins and therapy strategies fail.  And sometimes, you get a patient that has had multiple relapses, has stopped medication again and again, has heartbroken their beloved, and at one point something clicks, and they are able to respond to therapy and improve. And it is at that point, in op's mom life, that she is finally at a good point but still greatly vulnerable and the 20 yo daughter snaps at her. At max, give a NAH, but not N T A.", "You have every right to feel slighted that your mom is trying this time (I somehow doubt it will hold). Your mother has some fucking nerve for blaming you. Why do people act like actions have no consequences. How are you supposed to be responsible for your grown mother?

If you can truly realise this, it will hurt way less.", "Yeaaaah that's gonna be a hard no dawg.  It would be one thing if she owned up to her mistakes and made it an apology to you for fucking up and not caring enough but she just made it about her.\n\nNTA", "NTA-something your family has forgotten, that you should reminded them of, is, you are the child, she is the adult. It is not your fault that your fully adult mother cannot handle harsh truths. Her reaction speaks volumes. She is not ready to have more children. Do not blame yourself, you did the adult thing and walked away from an uncomfortable situation. If your mothers reaction is to run away, that is 100% her problem.", "NTA\n\nAnd her boyfriend is so out of line for putting this on you... They both sound horrible.", "NTA. Of course that's going to give you a massive emotional reaction and you were sensible enough to leave rather than lash out at her. That's a good choice! You cannot be held hostage to your mothers addiction. Yes it is good to help. Yes it is good to support. But you're your own person and I cannot fathom anyone not having a big reaction to that news because *of course* your brain is going to jump to comparisons, even if those comparisons aren't right. She's a different person to who she was 20 (and 10, and 7) years ago, so she's making different choices, and that is not a reflection on you at all, but of course it's gonna feel like that. I'm glad your parents are supportive and I hope you get less hassle soon.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your mom is capable of seeing this realistically. I\u2019m guessing that she\u2019s finally sober for a while and is feeling hope for the first time in a long time. She\u2019s desperately hoping that she can keep this turned around and finally be a good mother to a child. She knows she wasn\u2019t a good mom to you and wants badly to do better this time. I\u2019m honestly not so hopeful that she will pull it off this time, either, but she desperately wants to.\n\nIf you were around her when she was using, she doesn\u2019t have the same memory of those times that you do.

That\u2019s all she can do now. \n\nNone of that means it was ok. It absolutely wasn\u2019t ok. You\u2019re wounded and need to take care of you. Of course you feel resentful to think that maybe she can hold it together for this new baby, but couldn\u2019t for you. Perfectly understandable that you don\u2019t share the same feelings. You take care of you. Concentrate on that.", "NTA\n\nYour Mom's sobriety and mental health are not stable enough for her to be able to truly commit to being a good parent.

Your mother and her bf", "Please don't let them talk you into raising the new baby.", "NTA and it's not your fault she's missing, she's an adult and needs to go to counseling when she's upset about someone saying something to her.  My sister is an alcoholic and when I was in my teens, I started going to Al-anon.  It helped me realize that I can't stop her from drinking (and screaming at me and throwing things at me), but I can control my reactions to her.  My parents put her in rehab when she was 21 after she almost hurt our mom, and we were lucky in that her therapy actually stuck and she stopped drinking with no relapses.  That's very rare. My point is that your mom's recovery is on her and has nothing to do with you.  You may want to go to Al-anon or Al-ateen (if the al-anon people are too old) to get peer support.  Definitely not your fault, you have the right to your feelings.", "NTA you did nothing wrong and you are completely right in your assessment that she cares mor about her new family than you.

She has been doing better for the baby but I was jealous because I didn\u2019t get to have a childhood or much a mom but I do hope my mom keeps it up because the baby does deserve better than what I got. I wouldn\u2019t want the kid to go through the same stuff I did. \n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for your mothers wellbeing. She put this on herself. She can\u2019t decide to ditch her child and start a whole new family like she did nothing wrong. I\u2019m glad she wants to do better for the baby but she needs to realize she has another kid.

Your mother's disease is not your problem to manage, and for those other grown-ass adults to expect you to assume ANY kind of responsibility after being abandoned by her is ridiculous.
