My uncles always explained that she had a disease and her leaving me with them was proof of her love for me.\n\nYou can imagine that my relationship with her has always been complicated, but I've always tried to understand that this is something that is out of her control. In the last months, she's been on a good streak again, stopping all that shit, she's moved in with a new boyfriend and he seems to be someone that wants to help her out. We don't see each other much but I try to call her at least every 15 days, and my parents always try to report to me about her improvements.\n\nHowever, last week, after a long time, she was the one that called me and asked me to go out. I tried not to get too excited because I already know what she's like, but at the same time, I was happy. When we met, she explained how her boyfriend has helped her to cut 100% contact with anyone who influences her to go back to addiction, and how she wants to be a better person. She even started therapy and went to rehab for a while. I said I was very happy and asked what finally motivated her to make that decision.\n\nAnd then she told me that he helped her but that the big motivator that gave her strength is that they decided to start a family and that she wanted to meet me in person to let me know that she is pregnant. She said she needed to be better, to be present, and that is what is helping her focus on recovery.\n\nIt hurt me, you know? That they were worth it, but I wasn't. I decided to leave before our lunch was even over and ignored all forms of contact from her thereafter. As people say, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.\n\nHowever, yesterday her boyfriend called me (I answered because I didn't have his number saved) and he started yelling at me, he said I was an asshole, that for him I would never have contact with his family, because apparently no one knows where my mom is and what hindered her improvement was my attitude. My grandparents are also angry with me and said that I am very irresponsible and that I didn't have emotional responsibility with someone very vulnerable.

She had support: a boyfriend, her parents, and other relatives who raised you for her.  Support is supposed to either go down (parent to child or older adult to younger adult), sometimes sideway (peer to peer or siblings about the same age or consenting adults like in dating or marriage), but not up.

You\u2019re mother probably tried to quit drugs many times before for your sake when you were younger but failed. Something had to be motivating the good spells when you were a kid right?

You have not the slightest bit of responsibility to her for anything. \nPlease do not listen to anyone laying any kind of guilt trip on you. You do not deserve it. \nI am wishing the best for you. Your uncles are your real parents, as you know. Consider blocking anyone who blames you for your mother\u2019s wretched choices. Absolutely NTA.", "She probably does if she's off slipping back into addiction. \n\nAnd be that as it may, if she is off slipping back into addiction she is right back to making the same bad choices and so she wasn't as far along in her recovery as she thought she was. \n\n\nNone of which is ops fault. OP absolutely had the expected result of being delivered that blow and of her m wasn't prepared for that she's an idiot.", "OP please consider going no contact until she has gotten help from someone QUALIFIED. BF sounds like a typical user", "No. Don\u2019t. You have your own life to live. You have no obligation.", "Fixed it. Thank you!", "I would be willing to bet that mom's new boyfriend is also in recovery of some kind. Most of the time if you find a guy as described by op's Mom you're finding him while you're both in rehab etc.", "The dad is most likely bad news. I expect child services will ask uncles and OP before the baby goes into the system.", "Those are the only people who is to blame, and did I say that her reaction was not reasonable or unfair? I am saying that her mom being pregnant now with a stable partner is not something that is blame worthy nor is it a reflection of OP's past.", ">I am saying that her mom being pregnant now with a stable partner is not something that is blame worthy nor is it a reflection of OP's past.\n\nSo you voted on something that wasn't the question?  The \"explanation\" was 1: I gave her the silent treatment and 2: A bunch of people are blaming me for her running off and accusing me of being the reason she did.\n\nHer giving the silent treatment isn't an asshole move.  Her catching flak for not being \"emotionally mature\" and the reason druggy mummy is missing is a massive asshole move."]}
