We don't see each other much but I try to call her at least every 15 days, and my parents always try to report to me about her improvements.\n\nHowever, last week, after a long time, she was the one that called me and asked me to go out. I tried not to get too excited because I already know what she's like, but at the same time, I was happy. When we met, she explained how her boyfriend has helped her to cut 100% contact with anyone who influences her to go back to addiction, and how she wants to be a better person. She even started therapy and went to rehab for a while. I said I was very happy and asked what finally motivated her to make that decision.\n\nAnd then she told me that he helped her but that the big motivator that gave her strength is that they decided to start a family and that she wanted to meet me in person to let me know that she is pregnant. She said she needed to be better, to be present, and that is what is helping her focus on recovery.\n\nIt hurt me, you know? That they were worth it, but I wasn't.

New baby has a whole other family, no?", "No assholes?  What about the bunch of people verbally abusing OP for her (frankly) reasonable reaction?", "Ignore this comment OP, you are NTA. Your mom\u2019s BF was *way* out of line calling to scream at you and blame you for your mother disappearing. Sorry your grandparents are taking his side. Your reaction is valid and it\u2019s completely understandable to need space after that kind of news.", "It doesn't sound like OP is anticipating having much if any relationship with her half sibling.", "Nope you have ZERO obligation to this possibly future kid, OP.", "I disagree, OP is completely within bounds to decide whether or not she wants a relationship with her mother. And if she\u2019s not interested, that is entirely fair. Addicts deserve grace from society in general, but they certainly aren\u2019t entitled to it from the people they\u2019ve directly harmed.", "Really?  OP, the neglected kid who was hung out to dry may be the only thing that the do-over baby has?  Give me a fucking break.", "Not her responsibility", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There are benefits, even if OP can\u2019t see it through the hurt they are feeling. Now, if it\u2019s all toxic then definitely stay away but it sounded like OP really d i d want a relationship with mom. That is still possible.\n\n\nMom alone is 100% responsible for her own actions so if she relapsed or worse, that isn\u2019t on OP. The boyfriend needs to be in Al-anon too because he can\u2019t be blaming anyone else for what an addict does.", "It\u2019s not about the kid. It\u2019s about OP", "im gonna be honest with you. i think the relationship is done. as in the boyfriend, HATEs op, so good riddance, i guess. i mean, does anything actually change for op, tho yea, she might get fewer updates, but she'll move on like she did when she was abandoned. lol", "To each their own. I'd help my sibling not to end up feeling like me. Everyone is different though."]}
