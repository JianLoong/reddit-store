My uncles always explained that she had a disease and her leaving me with them was proof of her love for me.\n\nYou can imagine that my relationship with her has always been complicated, but I've always tried to understand that this is something that is out of her control. In the last months, she's been on a good streak again, stopping all that shit, she's moved in with a new boyfriend and he seems to be someone that wants to help her out. We don't see each other much but I try to call her at least every 15 days, and my parents always try to report to me about her improvements.\n\nHowever, last week, after a long time, she was the one that called me and asked me to go out. I tried not to get too excited because I already know what she's like, but at the same time, I was happy. When we met, she explained how her boyfriend has helped her to cut 100% contact with anyone who influences her to go back to addiction, and how she wants to be a better person. She even started therapy and went to rehab for a while. I said I was very happy and asked what finally motivated her to make that decision.\n\nAnd then she told me that he helped her but that the big motivator that gave her strength is that they decided to start a family and that she wanted to meet me in person to let me know that she is pregnant. She said she needed to be better, to be present, and that is what is helping her focus on recovery.\n\nIt hurt me, you know? That they were worth it, but I wasn't. I decided to leave before our lunch was even over and ignored all forms of contact from her thereafter. As people say, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.\n\nHowever, yesterday her boyfriend called me (I answered because I didn't have his number saved) and he started yelling at me, he said I was an asshole, that for him I would never have contact with his family, because apparently no one knows where my mom is and what hindered her improvement was my attitude. My grandparents are also angry with me and said that I am very irresponsible and that I didn't have emotional responsibility with someone very vulnerable.

Support is supposed to either go down (parent to child or older adult to younger adult), sometimes sideway (peer to peer or siblings about the same age or consenting adults like in dating or marriage), but not up.

This could mean the decision they made, in hindsight, wasn\u2019t the best decision, but they didn\u2019t know what they know now. Same with addiction.

Without ever apologizing that he hurt me. Because the addict in him HAD to always be in charge, and always decide how it went. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m frustrated he never got the balls to apologize for not respecting my boundaries, but not sad. I knew this was him, and I didn\u2019t expect anything different from him. He just continued to prove that.\n\nYou see, when I was 16, we went to rehab. He blamed me and my brother for all his problems. In the group session. Where he was supposed to be taking responsibility. I screamed at him. In front of everyone. I told him he needs to grow the fuck up. I walked out. I refused to come back. His counselors told him he was wrong, and I was right. \n\nThree years later, he was drinking again. At my college holiday party, when I was on a date, he got shit faced drunk. In front of ALL of my professors and classmates. I stopped him from drinking and driving\u2026 and he gave me bruises that night. He didn\u2019t believe me when I showed him the next day. He went back to rehab. He was sober since \u2014 but he never addressed his issues with some of his behaviors. He never tried to better himself. And honestly, he was narcissistic. He was one person in front of others, when they could praise him, but he was completely different for those who weren\u2019t. This is why, 16 years later, I went no contact.\n\nYour mom seems to be trying. Will she have it all figured out? No. Will she always be perfect? No. But at least she owned up and talked to you about this in person.\n\nI recommend you seek your own counselor.

I told her how much it hurt me, and the way it came across. I told her I knew she wasnt trying to be a dick, but that all that attention to my brother and not to me when I needed help was hurtful. \n\nOur relationship has actually transformed.

I figure as a culture we're even more aware of the work it takes to care for living beings who aren't even sentient... (although I guess it's possible OP isn't in that cultural space)", "I have a chronic pain disorder. For years, I was on fentanyl patches. Although I was dependent on them, I never became addicted. I decided I didn't like the side effects and had a doctor wean me off of them. It sucked, but not once did I ever say \"You know what? I'm going to go get some more fentanyl.\" At present, I have a monthly prescription for a different controlled substance. I have never abused this. I CHOOSE to take these drugs, as directed, legally. I always have. It's been 20 years. \n\nOnce a person CHOOSES to use drugs illegally, you're right, they eventually lose the ability to choose anymore. But that first time? Unless someone is literally tying them down and forcing them to take it, they CHOSE to do it. \n\nYes, addiction is a terrible disease. But it starts with a choice. And because so many people make poor choices, pain patients like me are treated like addicts.", "Also, probably controlling, which is how he's kept her away from her friends. He thought a child would help settle her down and he could prevent her from doing anything. To speak to OP this way proves it. He doesn't care that she abused OP. They are supposed to help their mother anytime she comes crawling back but is not able to say anything negative. What planet is he on that the victim is made responsible for the mother's poor choices that started before they were born? NTA", "\u201cI didn\u2019t get hooked on fent so addiction isn\u2019t real\u201d\n\nDid you read any part of the comment you\u2019re replying to? Addicts brains are literally altered. All day and night their brain is telling them to get more of their substance. Just because it didn\u2019t happen to you doesn\u2019t make it any less real.", "People survive car accidents without using seatbelts so let's just remove them from cars all together. \n\nDepression is a CHOICE/S\n\nRespectfully, it's great that for whatever reason you don't seem to have the trigger for addiction with opiates.\n\nBlaming addicts for being addicts is like blaming you for having a chronic pain condition. It's very much genetic, it's very much a symptom of people in a great deal of pain. \n\nYour lack of addiction is due to a lot of steps that you've taken for sure, but it's due to the luck of the draw with your genetics. \n\nWe have helmets because while plenty of people fall off bikes and are fine without them, many people fall wrong and end up dead.", "not all addicts do that.. in 12 step addiction recovery groups, they suggest that addicts in recovery should take responsibility for their life and addiction. \nmaking amends to people they\u2019ve wronged is literally one of the 12 steps, as it should be. \nAddiction is no excuse and OP is definitely entitled to their feelings, as we all are.", "This. The victim card is always used. I\u2019ve had a lifetime of being made to feel bad for my addict mother and like I owed her some sort of loyalty when she was doing far worse things as a mother herself. Best thing I ever did was cut her off. Healthiest thing too!"]}
