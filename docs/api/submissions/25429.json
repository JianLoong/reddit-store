Once that it all out and on the table you can look at where money is going and what you have. Budgeting 101. \nThen look at what you both would have to pay for child care. What does this new job pay. \nNow you see what it would look like to combine it all. Split all the bills in half and what does it look like. Do you both still have money? Or how do those bills need to be divided?  It needs to be something you can agree on.  Be it you each put $1000 or $2000 into a joint account that all the bills come out of, and the rest of the money is yours to spend. Or maybe you have the bills account and a joint savings that is for a house or other joint expense. \n\nHubby and I have only joint accounts. The chequing. The major purchase savings (new vehicle or toy we are saving up for), house emergency fund (hot water tank or anything unexpected), renovation fund (this was windows, but we have added the money we would need to replace the roof). \nAll these things are things you don\u2019t really think of and expenses that come up and you need to be on the same page. \n\nUntil you both lay out your bills and who is expected to pay for what, and if that can realistically happen, ESH", "NTA.

What exactly does he say when you remind him that in a traditional marriage, if the woman looks after the house and kids, then the man provides/pays the bills?", "I wouldn't because it's still going to be the same. You can't pay your bills so you will be back in debt again. He wants you to give him all your money. Tell him you want a certain amount for Childcare. (Less than a daycare).

However, I would say that it sounds like HE probably thinks you're likely to get married if you're going to be sharing debt. \n\nWhen my wife was in law school and we were dating/talking about getting married, she used to joke \"love me, love my debt\" about her truly monstrous student loans. But that was fine, because ultimately we were going to become one financial unit. And ultimately it paid off for both of us when she became a corporate lawyer and started making big bucks.\n\nAnnnnnnnyway, in that case definitely NTA. But also, might want to think about moving on to someone who you might marry, because trust me... spending time with someone who you can't see yourself with, and is making you upset over money-type stuff... not a good use of time, and time is something you can never get back!\n\nGood luck!", "Ok. Sp take the contract and pay half the car payment since he uses it and half the house since his name is on it. Then make him split utilities and car insurance since he drives the car. Then both of you have separate savings. Don't pay any extra toward his bills. If you want to pay the utilities then tell him he can use what he's saving on those to pay down his debt. But pay off your debt and keep some back. Otherwise what's going to happen is your money will all be going towards the house while his money is used for what he wants. You will still have debt and he won't. Bit if he's driving the car he does need to pay half of the payment and ins. That's only fair. And half the mortgage if he's on it.", "Very much so. It\u2019s all about what benefits him.", "He used to be really great. The last 6 months has REALLY gone to shit and don\u2019t know why. I tell him constantly that I don\u2019t want the kids to grow up thinking this is normal, because it\u2019s not. They deserve to be happier than this. The only thing holding me back is: 1) home is 600 miles away - if we go to court for custody, the courts could make me stay here with NO support, and I don\u2019t want 50/50, I don\u2019t want to miss a second with my son. And 2) I love being able to be a SAHM, the contract is only 14 weeks so my plan was to do that, and take 3 months off, do another one, and just repeat that cycle.", "Consider whether that's what you want for the foreseeable future.

Also doubt he wants custody - sounds like he has palmed off his first child on you and can't be bothered with either child much now so really don't think he cares for custody. Could offer no child support in exchange for allowing you to move back home. Maybe talk to a solicitor for advice just in case. Good luck, I hope he sorts himself out but if not I'm sure you will have a great life without him", "I agree. I really do hope he sort himself out, but if he keeps it up, I\u2019m gone.

I don't know that I want to jump straight to leave him, but definitely do not give him your money! And why does he expect you to pay off his debts when he never paid off your debts?

Because once you pay off the debt, he will think he can get you to pay for everything when it comes to him. I know from experience. I hope that makes sense", "I agree with this!", "NTA lady but you need clear boundaries with this dude. You are acting like childcare for his son and he's not paying for your car, which he also use. He is using you.", "Does he do half of the chores? I bet he doesn't.\nI don't know how you got to this point, but these things should be discussed before getting together. Right now you are in sort of an adversarial relationship with him. To a certain degree you see to feel like you contribute less than him because you pay less. So you do more work and you are supposed to pay the same amount?\n\nYou need to first understand how much you contribute to the household. From the sound of it I feel you actually contribute more than him. Once you have that analysis done, you have to have a serious discussion with your bf so you get it down to 50/50 whatever way it may be. It doesn't mean you both pay half the bills, it means you both contribute the same to the household. Now it doesn't need to be perfect, but there needs to be a clear understanding so no one feels the other is taking advantage or such, or that their contribution is not \"good enough\".\n\nAlso the fact that you are not working is affecting your career. So paying child care might be more expensive in the short run but in the long run it might be cheaper. So you need to check what is best for your future and your child's future. What happens if you separate and you can't make much money because you don't have experience. What happens if he dies?\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Do NOT pay his debt! He\u2019s responsible for his own just like your are for yours It\u2019s interesting, He doesn\u2019t think anything about spending your money\u2026 if given the chance. (Don\u2019t give him that chance)  Your NOT THE ASS! For not paying his debt.", "NTA. He manipulated you into this situation so he would be in control and not have to pay daycare; you took the hit because 1.5 of daycare would be his expense. Take the contract, put the kids in daycare. You pay half of your child's daycare, he pays for his kid and half yours. No other outcome is acceptable.\n\nGet your finances un order, then think about whether you want to remain with this selfish man.", "Why are you and partner having children you can't afford ?", "Lack of info here has me feeling like ESH. It sounds like, with the lack of info, to be clear, OP doesn't discuss or talk about their debt at all with him, and just deals. \"I missed payments and he never offered to help\"... well.. did you ask? Nowhere here does it even suggest that the boyfriend in question is \"his money is his and your money is ours\" beyond Op's word. Until we get info on if she's discussed and talked about this all, then everyone sucks.", "You stayed home so he could avoid paying daycare for his child or half the daycare for your child.", "Not marriage material, but you had a child with the man. Lol. Good thing children don't last as long as marriages... Oh wait", "Take the contract, take your kid and go. You're not responsible for his child in any way.", "And that is your signal to start running and fast.", "His cost. You gave up income to save him money.\n\nTalk to a battered women's shelter for help with an exit plan.", "You need to see an attorney and get advice for how to untangle this. Make an appointment now and specify that you want to move home where you have a support system.\n\nI once met a divorced guy who was bitter because the court allowed his ex to move their kids 3 hrs away,  whete she had friends and family. He was upset that she bought a new car and rented a 3 bedroom apartment. \n\nIt didn't occur to him their kids had their own rooms before the divorce or that the new car was safer.", "You could use some professional advice. It sounds like you are making a lot of assumptions about the worst case scenario if you left. If you were in the UK I would recommend the Citizens Advice Bureau. Maybe your country has something similar. NTA", "Pack up and move. The only reason he would want you to stay is so that you could take custody of his other child.", "NTA! You should take care of yourself and your child first. You already pay a lot of bill and groceries from what I understand, and even if he doesn't consider that big bills, you were supporting the family. Plus all the work with the children and at home. \nSo you were doing a lot wile going by without any support from him.\nIf you have anything extra you should build an egg nest or something separate from him. Just in case", "Tell him \"you're right dear, I'll help pay off your debt in the exact same way you've helped me pay off mine. How much was that again?\"\n\nNTA. But sorry, it sounds like he is.", "NTA, he clearly hasn't helped you pay for your things, so obviously his money is his your money is yours. \nLay down boundaries. You're not married. You have a child together that is both your responsibility. Other than that, when did the rules change all of a sudden, thinking you should pay his debt off. No way.. It sounds like he feels entitled to your money. He made you cut hours. You struggled without his help he can figure out a way like you did.", "He is taking advantage of you go back to full time work get in someone to look after the kids and split all bills", "So why are you still with him?"]}
