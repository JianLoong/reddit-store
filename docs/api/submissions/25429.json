He has shown no interest or consideration for your financial stability or debts, only his. That is a red flag. Keep your finances separate.

That being said, if you both not creating more debt and won't in the future, it might make sense to get all the debt paid and start saving for the future.", "NTA and sorry but your bf seems entitled af, how his first reaction for you getting great professional offer can be \"oh so you can give me sum\". If you talked and he still doesn't get what is wrong with his behaviour regarding this matter, you should think if you sacrificing yourself, your carrier, your comfort and probably many other aspects of life, is worth it.", "Nta", "NTA. Where was his ex while you were taking care of their child? She should\u2019ve been paying for at least half of what it would\u2019ve cost for that child to go to daycare. And he should\u2019ve been paying for the other half so you could pay your bills on time. Ultimately, your poor credit score will impact both of you. Take the contract, do the work, pay off all of your debts and put the rest in savings so you have something to draw from whenever you are short. Then look for child care for your child and return to work full-time. Do not allow yourself to be dependent upon a man who takes advantage of you.

If you were married, then it would make sense to combine finances. Here, you may want to hold off until you have substantial savings and then you could decide if it makes sense to help him with debt. Probably the best solution is to have an adult conversation about all your assets and expenses, and maybe meet with a financial professional for advice", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he never offered to help you pay off your debts, then he shouldn't expect anything in return. Besides, because I have traditional views on relationships, I particularly frown upon men who are willing to shift their debt burdens onto their women. Others may disagree with me and have their own views, but at the very least, bottom line is, if he never offered, he should never expect.", "NTA, congrats on the new contract.

He expects you to stay home with the kids but won't help with your bills. That's not right. You gave up.working full time for him. And don't pay half on any of the big bills. Pay your stuff and save the rest so you have something if you need it.

He already established keeping prior debt seperate.", "NTA", "Finances are hard. Communication about finances can be harder.  \nYou both need to sit down and make a list. A list of debt (education, car, credit cards {what the majority of cc debt is be it groceries, a large purchase or what not and I\u2019m not talking current balance, what you\u2019re struggling to pay off}, overdue bills and such), bills (rent, power, water, gas), and what your money coming in is. Once that it all out and on the table you can look at where money is going and what you have. Budgeting 101. \nThen look at what you both would have to pay for child care. What does this new job pay. \nNow you see what it would look like to combine it all. Split all the bills in half and what does it look like. Do you both still have money? Or how do those bills need to be divided?  It needs to be something you can agree on.  Be it you each put $1000 or $2000 into a joint account that all the bills come out of, and the rest of the money is yours to spend. Or maybe you have the bills account and a joint savings that is for a house or other joint expense. \n\nHubby and I have only joint accounts. The chequing. The major purchase savings (new vehicle or toy we are saving up for), house emergency fund (hot water tank or anything unexpected), renovation fund (this was windows, but we have added the money we would need to replace the roof). \nAll these things are things you don\u2019t really think of and expenses that come up and you need to be on the same page. \n\nUntil you both lay out your bills and who is expected to pay for what, and if that can realistically happen, ESH", "NTA.

I stayed home so we could avoid the cost of childcare, plus I enjoy having all the time I can with the kids. I think he expects me to contribute more, but for whatever reason, doesn\u2019t realize that while he\u2019d have to pay for someone to watch his kid and ours, I don\u2019t get paid.", "Yep!! I\u2019ve told him I can start charging to watch his kid (which most days I watch him all day and night, because BF sleeps during the day and works nights). He says it\u2019s a \u201cwoman\u2019s job\u201d to take care of the kids and the house. But for whatever reason, my argument that it\u2019s a \u201cman\u2019s job\u201d to provide and pay all the bills doesn\u2019t go over well lol.", "I agree. He was paying everything while I was at home with his child. I did not have much debt at all at that time. But I had a car payment he would always be reluctant to pay, or complain that he had to pay it on top of everything else, even though he drove that car to work, and everywhere else, like it was his own.", "I think that\u2019s his idea, we pay off all the debt and start working on saving. I probably would suggest our own saving accounts, of course. There\u2019s no reason why he couldn\u2019t start paying off his own debt with the extra money he\u2019ll have from the bills being split in half.", "Unfortunately the courts here are whack. We\u2019ve had full custody of his son for the past two years, and they won\u2019t charge her child support - but they charge him every single month even though she has no custody.", "You\u2019re right about the last part. I am considering leaving at this point. The only downfall is I\u2019m 600 miles away from home, and I have no family here. I\u2019m trying to work things out so I don\u2019t have to pretty much start all over again, but I\u2019m thinking that is going to be inevitable. \n\nWe could technically switch positions where I work full time and provide, and he can have child/house care duties. I just enjoy being a SAHM with my baby. It can be annoying sometimes to have to pretty much raise another child more than their actual parents do, but it\u2019s worth being home with my baby. We were both working full time, and while the money was great, we had to consider childcare. The cost of childcare just was worth it to continue working full time when I could just be home and raise the kids on my own.", "I agree with the marriage part. And honestly even if we weren\u2019t married, had he helped me when I struggled to pay mine, I would probably have no issue returning the favor.", "Luckily, we really aren\u2019t in THAT much debt. The contract could easily pay mine off in 3 months, and still leave me with enough money to be comfortable, even AFTER contributing more to bills. The contract could probably pay BOTH our debt off, but I feel like I should not have to pay his.", "We have talked about it in the past. I don\u2019t think anytime soon, and honestly at this point, I don\u2019t think we will ever.", "The \u201cbig bills\u201d is the house and car payment, which my name is on both. I currently pay the utilities and car insurance. If I take this contract working full time, and split the bills based on income, I\u2019d have to pay more than half, because my income would be doubled his.", "He says he pays the house and the car, and \u201clets\u201d me use the car and live here. That\u2019s my payment apparently.", "He sounds exploitative, honestly.", "Wow really? What does he do for you out of interest? I mean he must have some good qualities ... right? \nNTA but your young, maybe think about if this is what you want for life I'm not sure I would want my kids thinking this was normal, he's expecting you to do everything - childcare, household and pay?! If your happy great, if not ...", "NTA at all. What exactly does he say when you remind him that in a traditional marriage, if the woman looks after the house and kids, then the man provides/pays the bills?", "I wouldn't because it's still going to be the same. You can't pay your bills so you will be back in debt again. He wants you to give him all your money. Tell him you want a certain amount for Childcare. (Less than a daycare). Then when he pays you contribute to household bills proportionate to your income. And pay off your stuff with the money from that project and save the rest for an emergency.", "Don\u2019t. Save it to get away. He\u2019s a leech.", "Right sooooooo...\n\nIf you're not getting married then yeah, neither of you should be rescuing the other from debt. Finances have to be kept separate. However, I would say that it sounds like HE probably thinks you're likely to get married if you're going to be sharing debt. \n\nWhen my wife was in law school and we were dating/talking about getting married, she used to joke \"love me, love my debt\" about her truly monstrous student loans. But that was fine, because ultimately we were going to become one financial unit. And ultimately it paid off for both of us when she became a corporate lawyer and started making big bucks.\n\nAnnnnnnnyway, in that case definitely NTA. But also, might want to think about moving on to someone who you might marry, because trust me... spending time with someone who you can't see yourself with, and is making you upset over money-type stuff... not a good use of time, and time is something you can never get back!\n\nGood luck!", "Ok. Sp take the contract and pay half the car payment since he uses it and half the house since his name is on it. Then make him split utilities and car insurance since he drives the car. Then both of you have separate savings. Don't pay any extra toward his bills. If you want to pay the utilities then tell him he can use what he's saving on those to pay down his debt. But pay off your debt and keep some back. Otherwise what's going to happen is your money will all be going towards the house while his money is used for what he wants. You will still have debt and he won't. Bit if he's driving the car he does need to pay half of the payment and ins. That's only fair. And half the mortgage if he's on it.", "Very much so. It\u2019s all about what benefits him.", "He used to be really great. The last 6 months has REALLY gone to shit and don\u2019t know why. I tell him constantly that I don\u2019t want the kids to grow up thinking this is normal, because it\u2019s not. They deserve to be happier than this. The only thing holding me back is: 1) home is 600 miles away - if we go to court for custody, the courts could make me stay here with NO support, and I don\u2019t want 50/50, I don\u2019t want to miss a second with my son. And 2) I love being able to be a SAHM, the contract is only 14 weeks so my plan was to do that, and take 3 months off, do another one, and just repeat that cycle.", "Consider whether that's what you want for the foreseeable future. A relationship based on what's wonderful for only party is problematic.", "Save some money to get out when you need to. Also doubt he wants custody - sounds like he has palmed off his first child on you and can't be bothered with either child much now so really don't think he cares for custody. Could offer no child support in exchange for allowing you to move back home. Maybe talk to a solicitor for advice just in case. Good luck, I hope he sorts himself out but if not I'm sure you will have a great life without him", "I agree. I really do hope he sort himself out, but if he keeps it up, I\u2019m gone. I can\u2019t do it anymore!"]}
