She is some kind of a workaholic so it was really sweet that she made it. \n\nAnyway I introduced her to my nephew and they immediately hit it off. We ate dinner together and even played uno. My girlfriend doesn't really like kids but my nephew sure was an exception.\n\nMy sister came the next morning to pick him up. My girlfriend had left early in the morning but my nephew obviously couldn't stop talking about her. My sister asked me who he was talking about and I explained the situation. \n\nMy sister has met my girlfriend but doesn't really know her well. But we've been dating for 7 months. Sister got mad at me saying she left my nephew with me and not with someone who is essentially a stranger to him. She said I should have known better than to make him spend time with her and that I should have let her know that my GF was with us also.\n\nI said it really wasn't that big of a deal and we all had fun. She said I needed to grow up and start thinking like an adult. She got my nephew and left, saying she would think twice before leaving him with me again.\n\nDid I do something wrong?
