Three or four weeks after, i told her that we had to look for the kids and play with them and she was still okay. We said that she would come to my house at 10am to help decorate and then get ready to be at the party at 5pm before everyone arrives. Last week, she told me that she would be at my house at 4pm because she'd came back from her trip to Paris with her sister and our other cousin and because she had to go to the store with her mom to print some photos for her friend's gift, i told her that it would be difficult to be ready at time but it was okay, we'd be a bit late but it's okay because in fact the kids that went on a candy hunt would be here by 6pm. Today she sent me another message saying that she'd be at my house between 4pm and 5pm because her family was always doing break on the road, i was starting to get a bit mad because we were planning this since a few weeks, i said \"don't worry, it's not like we were planning this for weeks\" and then SHE started getting mad at me, saying that she had to cancel some of her plans to come \"babysitting\" at a Halloween party with me, so i said that she didn't had to tell me that she would come if she already had plans and then she said that it would be better if she was not coming, i said at least five times in like 10 minutes that people with sense don't cancel plans at the last moment, but she didn't care and when i asked her if she would finally come, she said that she wasn't coming.", "created_utc": 1667257050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yirn8i/aita_to_blame_my_cousin_for_not_doing_halloween/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How does she have any control over how long they take to drive back to town?", "YTA - She is 15. She can't help her parents wanting to stop along the way. She can't help that there are errands that need to be done. She canceled plans to help you and you get mad at her when she isn't able to show up right on time? Yeah I'd bail on you too after that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
