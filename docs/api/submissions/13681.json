My siblings and my parents aren\u2019t really that tall (my dad is 6\u20192, my brother is 6 foot) and we don\u2019t know where I get it from but oh well. I don\u2019t really care anymore about it either but my sister (24F) seems to have a problem with it.\n\nAny time she meets one of my friends, she will ask them if they\u2019re only friends with me because I look like a freak, and she tells that I\u2019m \u201cactually really boring apart from my height\u201d. It\u2019s always this or something variation to this which includes insulting my height, or my face and says I\u2019m hard to look at (I have really bad acne, but she usually insults my height). I know she\u2019s just joking so I didn\u2019t say anything up until now but god it\u2019s so annoying. She\u2019s done this around 5 times now every time me and a friend are around her. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I get high every time I need to see her just so I can tolerate her. And I see her a lot, but usually she doesn\u2019t say as much when I\u2019m alone seeing her. Apparently she does it because I was the golden child and now she needs to toughen me up but she\u2019s just a dick.\n\nSo this time, me and my girlfriend (26F) were at my parents house where she was there. I didn\u2019t expect her to be there so I wasn\u2019t high this time, so naturally I was pissed off. My sister has met my girlfriend before and she\u2019s done these jokes before too. She asked me why my girlfriend is back again and she asked my girlfriend if it\u2019s because I\u2019m good at sex, but then she said my face is so ugly that only a gay man (not the word she used) could love me so she wonders if my girlfriend is secretly a transgender man (again, not the word). She also told me that she knows my girlfriend is only with me because of my height and that I am probably adopted because I\u2019m so tall (this makes more sense in context but I don\u2019t remember her exact phrasing). and that I look like an embarrassment when I\u2019m stood next to her and that she hopes she dumps me. This was all done throughout the course of the dinner. My girlfriend just smiled at her but I had enough and I told her to fuck off and that she\u2019s a rude bitch who doesn\u2019t deserve anybody. This wasn\u2019t in front of my parents but it was in front of my girlfriend, who was very upset with me. \n\nMy sister didn\u2019t say anything and nothing happened until after the dinner party is over, but afterwards my girlfriend asked me why I said that and I asked her if she was being serious and if she also heard what I heard. She said yes but my sister is clearly joking, and that calling a woman a bitch is very sexist as I\u2019m a man and that I should know how to control myself better (the last time we saw her I didn\u2019t say anything). My sister didn\u2019t say anything but my gf is clearly upset.

Your sister is an AH. But you handled it really wrong. You need to learn to respond to a minor offense in a proportionate way rather than taking it repeatedly and then exploding disproportionately.

Your brother  is +1 SD, your father is +2 SD. Unless you have a fairly rare condition involving a third sex chromosome, your height of +3-4 SD isnt that unusual for your family.

Also calling a women a bitch isn\u2019t sexist, guys can be bitches too.", "Hi, as a girl, I give you permission to call a bitch a bitch. Have a great day!", "Does your gf know she does it every time to you ? If she doesn\u2019t she may have just seen it as a one time thing which still doesn\u2019t make it ok", "What do your parents say about your sister's disgusting behavior?", "I don\u2019t think she was joking, your sister is just mad you could squish her with your fingers, also you being the \u201cgolden child\u201d is just an excuse for her to make herself feel better about being a shitty person in general", "NTA but honestly, not only is sister T A but also your girlfriend is T A H. Do you really want to be with someone who not only sits quietly and smiles at your bully while they put you down, but also flips out if you defend yourself? I wonder if you\u2019re so used to being bullied that you subconsciously believe you deserve it or that everyone is going to treat you like garbage. Dump gf and go no contact with any family member that bullies you or allows you to be bullied. \n\nA joke, by the way, is a comment that doesn\u2019t put another person down and causes people to laugh *with* you. An insult is a comment in which you are putting someone else down and you are laughing *at* them. Don\u2019t let people gaslight you into thinking otherwise.", ">Oh no, that is NOT clearly joking\n\nRight? OP, you *have to get high to tolerate her presence*. That is NOT joking and it is NOT normal. Add all of the bigoted comments she used to insult you and this is a person you should not be in the same room as, ever.\n\nAnd your girlfriend is almost as bad if she's okay with your sister's behaviour.", "This. But, OP, have a conversation with your sister. \"You making fun of my looks and my height isn't funny, it's hurtful. I want you to stop. If you don't, I'm going to start calling you out on it and making fun of you too. We're adults. It shouldn't come to this, but I have to draw a line at some point.\"\n\nApologize to your GF. Tell her that your sister has been doing this for X and you finally exploded, but you're sorry she was there to see it. You don't usually use that kind of language and will strive not to use it again, especially around her.\n\nAs a woman, I might be a little nervous if I saw a guy I was dating speak like that. At the same time, I wouldn't have tolerated someone speaking to my partner like that.", "NOBODY SAYS SHIT LIKE THAT AS A JOKE OMFG\n\nNTA and I need to go scream into the void", "I can\u2019t imagine just sitting there and allowing someone to try and tear my partner to shreds. All hell would rain down on them for that lol.\n\nLike do you really care for someone if you just sit there and LET that happen? Wtf", "Why fire a warning shot? Stop her in her tracks and shut that shit down the first time, every time.", "Calling her a bitch WAS the warning shot. She deserves a much harsher response.", "This is so true.  Bullies don\u2019t stop until they feel some pain themselves.  My older sister used to beat me up regularly until I finally caught up physically in size and strength.  I punched her back *once* and she never did it again.\n\nAlso, OP, if you can afford it, go see a dermatologist and get your acne under control.  You\u2019ll feel better about yourself and take away one of your sister\u2019s weapons.", ">You misspelled ex-girlfriend.\n\n100/100, congrats!", "I dunno, kinda seems the gf likes his sister more than him....", "I am guessing that according to the gf only women can be bitches. The original name bitch was used for a female dog, so maybe that's where she gets it? Idk, I have called both men and women out for being a bitch so I don't think it's sexist, but I will admit that it has been used more for a female than a male. Hell, I say I am a bitch half the time. There is even a song called Bitch by Meredith Brooks, I think it's a good song lol", "And Taint!", "Girlfriend doesn\u2019t deserve an apology she deserves kicked to the curb and replaced.  The has repeatedly watched the sister bully her bf and done nothing but smile then get pissy when he defended himself.   He deserves better than both those shitty women.", "Because alot of people would normally be on you for calling her a bitch. She deserved it and I agree that NTA, but if you read this sub alot of the time it would go the other way and call the guy an AH because \"you are never supposed to call a woman a bitch\".", "Yeah that's what threw me. The girlfriend not hvaing any issues with the sister throwing around slurs but bitch is where she draws the line. Like whut?", "I do that, too.", "Meanwhile the sister called him pretty much every other slur it's possible to call someone"]}
