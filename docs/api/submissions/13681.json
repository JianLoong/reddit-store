{"id": 13681, "submission_id": "12855iz", "title": "AITA for calling my sister a rude bitch in front of my girlfriend?", "selftext": "Hi. So I (22M) am 6\u20198. My siblings and my parents aren\u2019t really that tall (my dad is 6\u20192, my brother is 6 foot) and we don\u2019t know where I get it from but oh well. I don\u2019t really care anymore about it either but my sister (24F) seems to have a problem with it.\n\nAny time she meets one of my friends, she will ask them if they\u2019re only friends with me because I look like a freak, and she tells that I\u2019m \u201cactually really boring apart from my height\u201d. It\u2019s always this or something variation to this which includes insulting my height, or my face and says I\u2019m hard to look at (I have really bad acne, but she usually insults my height). I know she\u2019s just joking so I didn\u2019t say anything up until now but god it\u2019s so annoying. She\u2019s done this around 5 times now every time me and a friend are around her. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I get high every time I need to see her just so I can tolerate her. And I see her a lot, but usually she doesn\u2019t say as much when I\u2019m alone seeing her. Apparently she does it because I was the golden child and now she needs to toughen me up but she\u2019s just a dick.\n\nSo this time, me and my girlfriend (26F) were at my parents house where she was there. I didn\u2019t expect her to be there so I wasn\u2019t high this time, so naturally I was pissed off. My sister has met my girlfriend before and she\u2019s done these jokes before too. She asked me why my girlfriend is back again and she asked my girlfriend if it\u2019s because I\u2019m good at sex, but then she said my face is so ugly that only a gay man (not the word she used) could love me so she wonders if my girlfriend is secretly a transgender man (again, not the word). She also told me that she knows my girlfriend is only with me because of my height and that I am probably adopted because I\u2019m so tall (this makes more sense in context but I don\u2019t remember her exact phrasing). and that I look like an embarrassment when I\u2019m stood next to her and that she hopes she dumps me. This was all done throughout the course of the dinner. My girlfriend just smiled at her but I had enough and I told her to fuck off and that she\u2019s a rude bitch who doesn\u2019t deserve anybody. This wasn\u2019t in front of my parents but it was in front of my girlfriend, who was very upset with me. \n\nMy sister didn\u2019t say anything and nothing happened until after the dinner party is over, but afterwards my girlfriend asked me why I said that and I asked her if she was being serious and if she also heard what I heard. She said yes but my sister is clearly joking, and that calling a woman a bitch is very sexist as I\u2019m a man and that I should know how to control myself better (the last time we saw her I didn\u2019t say anything). My sister didn\u2019t say anything but my gf is clearly upset.

Your sister learned the hard way that you have teeth and will in fact bite back.

Your sister isn't joking. She is purposefully insulting you. If your girlfriend can't recognize insults, or even if she does and expects you to just take it, she needs to open her eyes and really see what your sister is doing. \n\nIf your sister is upset with what you said to her, too damn bad. She has been pushing your limits for sometime. Maybe this time she will learn not to do that again.", "I, a female don't believe in men hitting women, but in this case, I might make an exception if you smacked the shit out of your sister. Your girlfriend sounds like she doesn't have a backbone. Sorry, your sister is an asshole and a bully! BTW tall men are hot! One of my biggest crushes in high school was like 6'9. Own it!", "NTA.. and your GF seems the type that think women cant be abusers because obviously a man can defend himself", "Nta.  Sister played stupid games and won stupid prizes.  She deserved it.", "you could have used better wording but i don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for lashing out. ESH", "NTA. It seems that your sister took it well. Not sure why your GF was upset...", "esh\n\nas abbreviations said, better wording would've helped. your sister does come off as mean as hell for seemingly no reason, i guess to put on a show for the other parties that are present (red flag in and of itself, i've seen far too well). can't blame you for lashing out if it's this repetitive, but would've been best to talk to her privately and tell her to cut the shit.\n\ni would've done the same, and i suck too", "ESH. Your sister is an AH. But you handled it really wrong. You need to learn to respond to a minor offense in a proportionate way rather than taking it repeatedly and then exploding disproportionately. Talk to your sister privately. Tell her the height jokes bother you and ask her to never make another joke about it. \n\nPS You dont have a very accurate understanding of genetic height determinants. Your brother  is +1 SD, your father is +2 SD. Unless you have a fairly rare condition involving a third sex chromosome, your height of +3-4 SD isnt that unusual for your family. But i am curious: how tall is your sister? It's more common for girls to be sensitive about height, especially if she is +2-3 SD. Maybe her own height bothers her more than yours.", "ESH except your girlfriend.\n\nSo you thought to combat rudeness you had to be rude yourself? Your sister sucks for constantly insulting your appearance and trying to defend it by calling it \"jokes\"\n\nYou suck for choosing to be rude back instead of talking to her about it. You said it's annoying, how about telling her that and asking her to stop", "ESH \n\nyour sister is old enough to know not to degrade you, but if you haven\u2019t said anything to her about it prior to calling her out of her name, then your reaction was equally immature.", "so to get even with your sister being rude  \nyou use a word offensive to the gender of your GF in front of your GF and you're confused....", "ESH. Not a good look for the lashing out, the abuse, nor appeasement of the abuse. You all got a dose of what stressful times are going to look like in the future, unless there is commitment toward change.", "OP you're 22 and if you don't get used to how immature your sister is and just let it go then she's going to continue on.  Obviously your gf is much more mature to just let it go than you are, and you're obviously going to hear much worse as you get older besides what she's saying.  You need to learn to keep being the bigger person like your gf and take this as a learning lesson   As long as your sister thinks she's getting to you she'll keep doing it.  You ignore her then she'll eventually get tired of it.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA.

Not that women need to \u201cstand behind their man\u201d because it\u2019s their place or some patriarchal BS, but if she loves you, she would stick up for you. After the \u201cjoke\u201d is said at every damn opportunity, it\u2019s not a joke anymore and she clearly has some issue with you. You were completely in your right to call her a bitch because she was being one and HAS been one to you forever.
