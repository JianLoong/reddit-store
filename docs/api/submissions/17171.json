That was a conclusion based upon OP having a dirt yard, not an unfenced swimming pool or anything else.\n\nAh but you did. The person you originally responded to raised the possibility that OP, now being aware that a toddler was regularly visiting her property, might conceivably be liable if the neigbour's child was injured on her property. She concluded her comments with: \"IANAL, consult one.\" You replied with: \"Lawyer here.\", and then you gave your advice. I'd like to see you argue that this somehow does not constitute giving legal advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Kinda hard to see how OP would be negligent merely for owning a property.\n\nAnd this was clearly your advice - \"don't worry about it\". But the thing is, nobody (in the first world, mostly) only owns a dirt yard. There are always potential dangers, especially for a toddler. You assuming that there's literally nothing but dirt - a hypothetical that never exists in reality - would seem negligent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you want to make-up stuff, instead of a pool...\n\nI never made anything up. The comment about the swimming pool is something I said to another commenter, where I was giving an example of instances I'm aware of where a person absolutely can be held liable for the results of such trespass. I also raised possible issues such as antifreeze and gardening shears, but it  seems you've read them. The point being that, unless you literally believe that people live in nothing but dirt, with no other potential hazards that might incur liability in such a case, then such liability is a real possibility.", "There is no grass in the front either.", "The reality in the US is that you can be sued for anything by anyone who can pay the filing fee.  And in some cases, that fee can be waived.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that suit will win.  Just means it\u2019s incredibly easy to sue someone."]}
