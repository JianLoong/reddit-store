My partner (27M) has always agreed with any choice I have made towards our daughter and has always tried his best to help me and her as much as he can. \n\nHowever this all started when my child was around 3 weeks old, I had her early (37 weeks) via emergency C-Section, my mother in law, came to see us when we was back home and all she kept talking about was having my daughter over night (MIL has 3 other children at home male 13, female 6 female 2) I politely said not a chance not yet, I\u2019m a new mum, I\u2019ve literally just had a operation and she\u2019s dependent on me due to her being breast fed, she can come for day visits when we are all a little more comfortable (as I just had her 3 weeks ago) but I have said no to any over night stays right now, she shut up and quietly changed topics, she left after about an hour and then we saw her once more since then when my daughter was around 3 months old.\n\nShe is due to come see us again on Friday (it is late Wednesday night when I\u2019m writing this) I have said to my partner if she goes on about having the baby over night whilst she comes Friday then I\u2019ll ask her to leave, he has said I\u2019m being unfair and that cause I let my older sister have our child for a few hours when he\u2019s at work and I went out for my birthday that it\u2019s only fair if his mum can have her over night, I said no I don\u2019t trust her to be out my care over night, due to still being quite little and also being breast fed, he now won\u2019t talk to me much and is calling me selfish, now I\u2019m dreading his mum coming on Friday and feel like they will both try getting me to let her have my daughter overnight when I\u2019m not ready and I don\u2019t trust her.  AITA??\n\n\nJust to add\n\nShe\u2019s always had a bit of trouble with her children she has 6 children she has my partner, a daughter who doesn\u2019t live with her due to moving for university and then she also has twin boys one lives with his dad and other lives at home with her and her 2 younger girls, the twins aren\u2019t aloud to both live with her (social services say so) and with her having social around and the police at her door all the time due to the twin boy who lives with her that\u2019s another part to my reasoning of her not having my daughter over night as I don\u2019t want her to be exposed to all that yet as she\u2019s still young \n\nUPDATE \u203c\ufe0f\nI\u2019ve spoken to my partner and showed him this post, he has finally seen my side of it all and agrees that her being away overnight will not only not be beneficial for her but also for my pp anxiety and depression and has agreed that if his mum mentions it on Friday to back me up and tell her it won\u2019t be happening any time soon and she can have her a couple of hours one week but once she starts showing more of an effort towards seeing her.

I will never ever let my future children to stay overnight at my FMIL's house because she always says rude things about me behind my back.

If you don't trust her then that is important and needs to be dealt with/talked out between you and your husband. I would cancel the visit if you feel they're going to gang up on you, or let her come but go visit your own family with the baby. \n\nBut also, how are you being selfish to not let your baby who you're still nursing go overnight when neither you nor your husband need it? Your MIL has 3 young kids at home, why does she need your baby overnight? And why are your MIL's wants more important to your husband than your own, the baby's mother and your husband's wife? \n\nYou and your husband may not agree on this topic and that's okay.

In fact your husband pouting and refusing to talk to you is being an asshole. As a recovering people pleasure. I can only give you what I think to do is best. I don't know if this will help you I hope it does.\nFirst, if he's having a hard time, understanding that nine months is when babies get sick a lot because they're immune system is horrible. I would say that is a much needed conversation if he really can't understand that.\n\nTwo maybe compromise not with mother in law with your husband. It'll just benefit mother in law. He pointed out that your sister watched the baby for a few hours. Tell him while you are not comfortable with the baby being gone overnight. As what you previously stated concerns are. if she is staying for more than one night. Or maybe that night that she comes.As a compromise, maybe let her watch the baby while you and him go to dinner.\nAs the child, the first grand child and a family. I've seen all my aunt's uncle's cousins act kind of like this. The only thing I can tell you is that as Seems to be your first child.. you are going to be overly protective of them because you are now responsible for a child. your husband doesn't seem to be at the same level. You are. and the more control over some situations you have, the better it will be for you.  Until you're ready for her to have overnights. This might be a good compromise. for your husband and your mother-in-law. And until you are ready, you can start building trust in mother-in-law using these small outings. Where she can babysit. she might still ask about it. But at least you can point out that you're letting her spend time with her to your husband and that you are trying to gain trust with her. I think the problem was that his mother and him had been talking and he seeing her Side of things more.That's his mom. It's creating a awkward situation. well I do agree. He should be United with you on this. showing him that you are going to at least try might go a long way.\n Because if you're not careful, he might start feeling like. It's you or his mother. And that's going to be a very horrible situation. For your life with a baby, it's gonna create a lot of arguments.\nThe only other advice I have for you is to maybe read a few monster in law tips From reddit subs", "Curious, how often does your sister see the baby? If MIL has only seen the baby twice the baby does even know her. NTA regardless.", "NTA\n\nYou need to get your husband on board before your MIL comes. There is a world of difference between your sister watching the baby for a few hours, and your MIL taking her away for a whole night. I'm assuming he trusts your sister, and if he didn't, you wouldn't let her babysit, so why is he trying to bulldoze you to let a woman you *don't* trust babysit?\n\nAlso, she's nine months old! What is going in with people demanding to take infants away from their parents overnight? I didn't have overnights at other people's houses without my parents also staying there until I starting having sleepovers with friends.

The normal place for a baby is with its mother.\n\nBut aside from my personal radar, I think the moral reasoning of this situation is that this is an area where you have veto power. A baby is not something you have a moral obligation to share around like candy, with everyone who wants access to the baby getting their designated share. Your husband does not get to decide that keeping your own baby with you is selfish. That is extremely manipulative on his part and I would see that as a red flag personally. \n\nStick to your guns and do what feels right to you. Mom instinct is a real thing.", "NTA.

That is not something even if you had a child before you can jump on with no help the night of. Also do they even have a crib, monitor etc.   Becasue this is your husband mother I assume you don't want cause problems in the future. Is there any other thing you can talk to your husband about trying that would make him happy with it but still keep you happy too?\n\nCould you all try to to comprise and have her stay over for the night and she and your husband can be in charge and let you sleep and if it doesn't work out you can ban her from trying anything more until the baby is grown. Could you give a timeline of when the baby can stay over such as when they is not breast fed or sleep through the night or over the age of 1 1/2?", "I'm confused. Has she asked twice to have her overnight or is she constantly pushing for it? I don't think it's wrong for her to want to her grandbaby over for a sleepover, what's wrong is if you continuously say no and she keeps pushing it", "NTA. No one \u201cneeds\u201d an overnight. Certainly not a 9 month old that barely knows the MIL. Does she live nearby? Why has she not seen this child more than twice in 9 months. My kids were at least 2 before I ever spent a night away from them and even then it was just with my husband. We have had grandparents stay over at our house with them when we\u2019ve left town but we\u2019ve never even done a sleepover otherwise. \n\nIf she asks, you just say, \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable being apart from her overnight. She is very attached to me and she barely knows you.

WHY can't her two girls live with her? Is SHE safe to have your child around?", "What possible benefit would tere be for your child in being away from you overnight?\nWhy is your husband not prioritising you and his daughter rather than his mother.\nYou are absolutely NTA and as she is breastfeeding it's impractical too.", "NTA\n\n\nYou do not have to justify your reasoning behind not letting your new baby go out overnight! Your husband's argument about your sister isnt the same, you mentioned she only watched her for a few hours while you both were out. This is not the same as having the kid over for the entire night. Your child is being breastfed, which poses a valid reason in not being viable. But aside from that I wouldn't use that as your main excuse, because I see your MiL looking for ways to negate that at some point. You need to sit down and have a calm and rational discussion with your bf about this. You need him to understand that he needs to support you on this..not wanting your brand new baby to be away from you is a valid enough reason without throwing in all the other potential risks such as your MiL being under CPS watch. Does your bf realise the potential risks to your own parental rights if your kid is with your mil and she gets raided and it goes badly? Is he willing to take that chance to appease his mother? By all means if you are both comfortable, let her babysit for a couple of hours like your sister did, but if you aren't comfortable with your kid being away from you for such and extended period then you have the right to say no. I also find it strange that she barely shows any interest in the kid for the last 3 months and then will potentially want to take them overnight.... Why?? If you can't manage time to visit, why would you trust her to manage time to care for the baby overnight. I hope your bf understands where you are coming from. But You are NTA .

Doesn't your MIL have her own children to take care of?", "NTA, baby is 9 months old, why would the baby go for overnight stay on a whim because grandparent wants it.\n\nNo need to rush and if there are issues in grandparents home I wouldnt as the parent want my child there overnight.", "My mama who was there for the birth of my son by my request & rubbing my feet and being awesome did the first year with me doing once a month overnight visits & the deal was I put him down with me, but when he woke at an ungodly hour he was all hers to hang out with etc. I was pumping and brought bottles. She embraced this and was really cool about it & I often got to sleep in and spend some time with my husband. Now that he\u2019s 7 she gets tons of consideration about seeing him and I very much work around her schedule so they can visit together!", "I breastfed all my kids. I don't think any of htem were away from me before they were 2 years old. Her fascination with having the baby over night is weird. Especially since she already has a cPs case and troubled child.", "TA for burying  the lead.  If it's because she has parenting problems then no she can't keep the baby overnight.  You made it sound like you just don't like her", "I'm unsure how your partner expects the baby to be fed overnight, if it's with your MIL?", "NTA\nBut I think it would be a serious mistake to let her watch the baby unsupervised at all.\nSocial services says she can't watcher HER OWN KIDS why would you give her yours? ESPECIALLY at an age where yours can't TELL you if something bad happens.", "I never left my kids overnight like that! I can't imagine someone demanding to take my baby!!!!", "Your child isn't some toy that needs to be shared equally. \n\nYou as the parents know best. NTA.", "NTA. Don\u2019t question yourself, feel assured that everything you\u2019re doing is for the safety and wellbeing of that precious baby girl that you carried.", "Seriously, husband is an idiot if he doesn't understand the difference between babysitting for a few hours for the benefit of the parents and MIL taking a baby overnight for no reason, to no one's benefit, and without the full support and trust of both parents.", "I don\u2019t know fully why, it\u2019s just the things I\u2019ve been told by MILs mum (my partners Nan)", "I\u2019m the same my mum and dad don\u2019t have her over night and never will", "It\u2019s also weird that she hasn\u2019t seemed that interested in visiting the baby, but only wants her to stay at her house overnight.", "She is your child. Not hers.  You get to be mama bear and decide on any overnight visits.  I personally would never let this happen in view of what you told us about her.", "Dude. When the words \"you are selfish\" come out of someone's mouth, get offended and show them the door. This is why people like the word \"fuck\" by the way. \"I'm selfish? Get the fuck out of my house.\"", "The healthy authorities in my country prescribe to exclusively breastfeeding for 6 months and then continue breastfeeding while introducing formula. World Health Organization prescribe 2 years breastfeeding. I only did 14 months. So my baby started napping at my mom\u2019s after 1 year when I went back to work. And then slept over after 2 years. \n\nYour MIL is selfish. She probably have a mental illnesses to cuddle babies. That\u2019s why she keep having babies and when they grow out of that stage, she was not a good mother and went on having another one. \n\nAccusing you of hogging due to breastfeeding is simple the most selfish, entitled, and evil thing to say in order to have her play time with your daughter. She only care of her playing with your daughter, not the baby health. I would straight up yelled at her.", "What the hell do you mean \u201cshe\u2019s always been in a bit of trouble with her children\u201d??? Some of them aren\u2019t allowed to live with her? There\u2019s CPS and police at her door constantly??? What is going on?", "NTA. He\u2019s an idiot if he thinks a few hours equates to overnight. She can spend the night at MY house is it matters that much to her.", "You made that baby. It\u2019s your right to \u201chog\u201d her all you want. \n\nNext time agree with her and say \u201c of course, I am, because it\u2019s my baby ! \u201c and don\u2019t engage after that. Because you can never win with such ppl \n\nAlso, if someone asks for over night stays, say no. Don\u2019t say not to right now, they simply take it as oh, that means she is gonna say yes later.", "My cousin has Down syndrome, his sister is two years older, and his other sister is 6 years younger, as soon as my aunt and uncle had him and he was diagnosed, they abandoned their loose \"plan\" to have each kid 2 years apart. \n\nI love him to death, but I also remember the stress and slight panic at my grandmas house when my other aunt had her baby, he really wanted to play with her, but obviously couldn't and didn't understand why. Meltdown ensued.\n\nAnd that was just a day visit...\n\nNTA- you made the right call, hopefully in a few years her kid will have settled a bit, and could be around the (slightly older) baby/toddler, but right now, it's just not worth even the slightest hiccup.", "His mom literally has CPS cases against her.  She\u2019s unfit to be around this child.  And the husband is trying to push the \u201cOP has postpartum depression\u201d angle to get his mommy\u2019s way and allow her unsupervised nights with a baby that can\u2019t tell anyone if Grandma does something weird?  Fuck everything about that.  I\u2019d be checking for Grandma and her friends on the sex offenders list.", "Trust your instincts, mama. They're there for good reason.

I had the bouncy seat on the bathroom floor so I could peek out at baby DURING MY SHOWER.\ud83e\udd23", "To be honest from all the things that you've said in the thread I wouldn't let my kid over there unsupervised at *any* age. Not to be rude but she sounds extremely irresponsible if not actually dangerous.", "In addition to all the other reasons not to let her take the baby overnight, the fact that the family is being so secretive about this situation in which bad things happened is... not a good indicator of safety for your child.", "That makes no sense sense to me. That she hasn\u2019t made effort to see you & your husband hasn\u2019t made effort to see her is bizarre.", "It\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s hard to imagine an actual human saying those things\u2026 this sub is such a reality check for me sometimes", "Seriously! She is a baby, not a toy OP won\u2019t share. No parent is obligated to let anyone other than the other parent hold their child and definitely not obligated to allow unsupervised time before they are comfortable with it. \u201cHogging\u201d her own baby, give me a break.", "So what exactly is MIL planning to do with the baby where she needs to not be supervised by a parent to do it?  This is so damn shady.", "This is how I feel about my own parents.. I survived you guys.. my baby will not experience your parenting whatsoever..

I work in child welfare and this is exactly the right answer. No overnights (unless absolutely necessary) until she can tell you the proper names for ALL of her body parts, understands that others are not allowed to touch them, and can verbalize to you if someone does. \n\nYour instincts are spot on and don\u2019t let anyone make you second guess yourself, especially not for their own selfish bs!

The decision, for me was, what kind of mother did I want to be and would I look back and regret my actions, or lack there of , based on someone else\u2019s opinion and the answer became a quick NO.
