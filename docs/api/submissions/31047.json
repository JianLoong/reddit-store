At some point, you are allowed to move on in your life.  You can\u2019t allow them to continue to project their grief onto you.  Go LC and be happy.", "NTA, you don\u2019t owe them anything and you only need to worry about the commitment to your current wife and unborn sons. I would straight up tell them, it\u2019s not mean, it\u2019s honest. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. They have conditioned you into thinking you owe them something. You owe them nothing, they took the inheritance. They are feeding their own grief in a sick way off your energy and kindness (for letting them get away with taking money)", "NTA. You will never forget your first wife and unborn child but that doesn't mean you don't get to move on with your life. I think you've spent enough time and energy on your former in laws as they moved through  a difficult time. You don't need to keep supporting them since your ex mil seems to want to suck the joy out of your current life.", "*I am thinking in just talking to them, and end the relationship*.\n\nIf this makes you uncomfortable, you could let the friendship taper off gradually.

I\u2019d at least give them the benefit of a sit down and talk to try and hash things out, including impressing upon them that although you wife and son are gone, you are not.

Not just a mourning club. \n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that it will go well. Maybe they will make the right noises, but who knows if they will follow through.

You can choose to respond and not share whatever information they are looking for.", "NTA. Congrats on your upcoming births. \n\nWhen I got married, my MIL was kind to me, at the same time she would make little jabs that weren\u2019t so kind. I\u2019d always let them go, but they really messed with my head. After like 8-9 mths of this, I shared this with my mom. She gave me the best advice. \n\nIf an in-law is comfortable enough to speak to you as if you\u2019re their son that they raised, that means that you in turn can speak to them as you would your parent. \n\nIf they can say to you, don\u2019t forget their daughter and child, you can equally say back I never will and  that you no longer want to hear them say this to you. That if they can\u2019t respect that boundary and also celebrate who you are, you\u2019re not sure how much further this relationship can grow and evolve. Let them know they haven\u2019t checked on you, and you\u2019re not sure what their intentions are to keep in touch. If it\u2019s solely because you\u2019re their connection to their daughter, they need to find comfort elsewhere.", "NAH. I get both sides really. You both went through an immense loss together, they with their daughter and grandson, you with your wife and child. I also understand that you feel like a placeholder for the love they had for her and are emotionally depended on. \nFor the \u2018conflict\u2019 part here, I responded NAH because you mentioned your feelings on how scary this is to be going through after the devastating loss of your first wife and child, it must be terrifying and triggering the trauma from that event. I imagine MIL feels the same in her own way, which is why she\u2019s distancing herself. It must feel like another stab in the heart for them to see everything they were excited for last time happening, but this time without their daughter.", "I am sorry for the loss you have suffered, it's not easy.  I'm afraid that your analysis of the relationship with your ex in-laws is spot on.  They view you as a connection to the daughter (and grandchild)  they lost - your gut is telling you this, and their actions show you this, it's never been about you.  I wouldn't go out of the way to \"end the relationship,\" it will eventually end itself.  If they reach out, be cordial - but keep it short and sweet (seriously).   I mean you'd be an asshole if you just called them up and said don't contact me anymore, there is a way to let things go without forcing it, time will do the work for you.  Congrats on the twins!  YWBTA", "NTA for wanting to distance yourself, but you have to understand that one of the world's biggest heartaches is to lose a child. It's different from any other loss in the world. You can lose your parents, wife, sibling, or whatever. I'm not saying that we don't miss those people - of course, we do - but losing a child is against the laws of nature in a sense. We are supposed to pass before our children and not the other way around. There is no grief worse than that. You are right that you are their connection to her memory and now you are moving on. That is very hurtful for them, but it is not your fault at all.\n\nI don't think you need to announce that you are cutting them off. Just call less, see them less, do less until it's about the level of contact that you desire.", "Gotta cut them off. \n\nYou move forward. Chin up. Smile.\nBecause your first wife would want you to be happy.\n\nGood luck.", "Sending you the best of wishes. You are NTA and you need to go very low contact with your MIL - She wanted you around and present in grief but you have moved forward with your life and that is not what she wants. Now that you have a new wife and babies on the way you are entering a different stage and she cannot share that with you. It seems since she has been no contact since the announcement that she has already pulled away.", "NTA.. it is time to let this relationship go. It isnt healthy for either of you. \n\nCongratulations on the twins. We know its impossible to forget your first wife and baby but hopefully there are happy memories that you can reflect on occasionally. It natural for you to move forward and create a new life. Best wishes", "NTA. Their lives will not move on at the same pace as yours, and because losing a child is a different type of grief. (No worse or better than losing a spouse, just different.) It may trigger her that your life is moving along, but it has to and I\u2019m sure your wife would not want you to be alone. Don\u2019t feel guilty for making the best of the rest of your life.", "NTA\n\nIt's really too sad, if they had been there for you and were able to open their hearts, they could be included in the joy of welcoming the new babies, and perhaps even welcomed as bonus grandparents.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA!  Some people thrive in grief and will never let the experience subside.  Which is where your ex MIL resides.  You have chosen to process your grief and move forward with a new start in life.  Congratulations and best wishes for an easy birth and healthy boys!!! \nPlease let these people go.  They are not healthy for you or your new family.  I\u2019m fairly certain your late wife is looking after you, your new wife and your new babies and wishing you so much happiness.", "NTA. And congrats on the twins! I (36M) have got 6 month old twin boys myself... prepare for crying in surround sound my friend \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. \n\nSo many social and business relationships have a limited shelf-life and will fade away as people move on with their lives.\n\nPeople who contribute nothing positive to your life don't deserve any of your time or emotional investment. Don't gift them any. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nI find it odd that they still want to have contact with you this long after losing your wife. With no grand kids to worry about I don't think there is any reason to keep in touch if you don't want to.", "I\u2019d have cut off contact once they cheated you out of your inheritance.   \n\nAnyways, you are not obligated to them in any way and you need to cut those toxic people out of your life now. NTA", "So, you lost your wife six years ago, and you got married again three years ago? That\u2019s absolutely reasonable. It sounds a whole lot like they expected you to be single for the rest of your life, which is quite unfair. Frankly I might have been a little confrontational at the message that you shouldn\u2019t forget your wife and unborn son. I am appalled *for you* on that one, dude.\n\n\u201dWhat makes you think I would ever forget about them? Do you think they meant THAT little to me? What have I ever done to make you think so little of me?\u201d \n\nAnd I probably would\u2019ve cut ties right then. \n\nNTA, not even close, and great for you for finding love and living life again after such unspeakable tragedy.", "NTA but I would do this slowly. They need therapy obviously as do you probably let\u2019s be honest it can\u2019t hurt. You\u2019re not breaking up like a girlfriend you\u2019ve been seeing for 3 months. \n\nYou can definitely scale down this relationship to holiday greetings and well wishes, since I\u2019m sure you will never in fact forget them (your wife and child)", "Yeah. I forgot to mention: whenever they feel I am not doing what they expect me to do they pull the \u201cyou are forgetting about your wife and son\u201d\nCard\u2026.", "Clear conscience! That\u2019s a good point and a fair concern! Thanks (FYI: even though it might sound like sarcasm, I really mean what I say here)", "Emotionally blackmailing someone and stealing 80k firmly puts you in the asshole category. Did you read the post?", "That\u2019s a fair point, but at the same time it\u2019s really difficult to me come to terms with not letting them know why I am drifting apart from them. I feel I at least owe them, and myself, an explanation\u2026.", "Yeah. I get everything you say, but I feel I owe them, and more importantly, I owe myself, an explanation as to why I am moving on and \u201cdrifting away\u201d from them\u2026.", "\"I could NEVER forget about my late wife and our unborn son. They are with me always. I think they would be appalled to hear you invoke their name to scold me for something you don't agree with. I'm going to create some space between us. I hope you can see a therapist and find more helpful ways to process your grief.\"", "Oh yuckkkkkkk\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy your guilt trip free future with your current wife and your sons!\n\n(Also I am sorry for your loss. That must have been so hard to lose both of them together. And to have her mother torture you about it makes it so much worse!)", "\"I gave you 80k that my wife would have wanted me to have.  Consider that my Fuck Off Forever payment.  Any further contact will be met by a bailiff with a cease and desist.\"", "Good luck. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that when making decisions like this, there is a real value to saying that you really did give people a chance to come along with you and were willing to work with them.", "Would telling them why you\u2019re drifting away make them feel better or you?", "That\u2019s a nice way I will probably rephrase in a more friendly way when I talk to them. Thanks!", "I like that. I like that a lot.", "\"Love is not a finite resource. I have enough love in my heart for both my late wife and unborn son and my new wife and future children.\"", "Engaging with those people in any way is basically inviting negative vibes into your life. Do not entertain any contact with them because it\u2019s clear they haven\u2019t tried to support you an ounce when you were also grieving your wife.\n\nIf it\u2019s been over three years, they need to seek grief counseling and not policing your life. NTA here too though I have commented elsewhere"]}
