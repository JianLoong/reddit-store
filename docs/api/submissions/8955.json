Need advice on this as I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being cold-hearted or if my opinion is valid. \n\nSo without giving too much away, I live in a tourist destination city in USA with theme parks. I really love going to them and have annual passes (no I\u2019m not a Disney adult lmao) and that is what I want to do for my birthday this Sunday. I graduated college back in august and work remotely so I\u2019m living at home with my parents to save some money. On my birthday that plan is to go to the theme parks with my mom, dad, and my boyfriend. Just us 4. We have dinner reservations and park reservations all squared away. My aunt and uncle and 7 year old cousin also have theme park annual passes, and I would love for the three of them to come with us. \n\nAunt and uncle work a lot, so they aren\u2019t so sure if they\u2019ll be able to come. They also live about 45 minutes from us, and we live about 20 from the theme park. My mom has suggested we drive to their house the morning of my birthday, pick up little cousin, and bring him to the parks with us. Then he will spend the night at my house with us. Now, he is a kid so I\u2019m not blaming him, but going to theme parks with him always includes him wanting to do certain things and throwing a fit when we don\u2019t do things he wants to. That\u2019s all fine, but on my birthday I just wanted to hangout with my family and boyfriend and do the things we like to do there (and also drink around the world a bit, iykyk) and I just don\u2019t want to deal with entertaining a kid, if his parents were there then it wouldn\u2019t be all on us. \n\nMy mom says I am being selfish and cold-hearted by saying I don\u2019t want to spend my birthday with a 7-year-old and that I need to grow up. I\u2019m not really a person who makes a big deal about my birthday, but having it on a weekend is a great opportunity to do something I really want to do.

What you don't want to do is spend your birthday catering to the whims of a child. There is nothing selfish about saying what you want to do on your birthday.", "NTA.  Why not have your parents entertain him and you and your bf can enjoy the parks doing what you want?", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday ffs. It\u2019s one day out of 365 and you all have annual passes. Choosing another day to go out with the kiddo should be easy as pie\n\nEDIT: but maybe there\u2019s your diplomatic solution. You say something like \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this for my birthday but how about we make plans to take the cousin out another day soon?\u201d That\u2019s not anti-family!", "NTA- I think it would be wise to state that you would rather just NOT GO if you are going to have to baby sit. And it would be different if it was a potential once in a lifetime experience for your cousin, but with his parents being annual-pass holders you aren't really denying him anything.", "NTA. This is a change for me because usually I'm the grumpy old person complaining about what people expect on their birthdays. \n\nBut solid NTA. Who wants to babysit on their birthday? That's unfair of your mom to be guilt tripping you about this. It sounds like the child has ample opportunities to visit the park with their parents or another time, so its not even like this is the one chance he has to go.", "NTA\n\nHe's not your kid and it's your birthday. I'm a firm believer in the birthday boy/girl gets to do whatever they want, and if other people are there to celebrate it, they abide by that to the best of their ability. You can either tell your parents they can look after him, but you'll be enjoying your day first and foremost. If they don't like that. They can either let you and your bf enjoy the park alone and look after the child alone, or not include him.", "Look, it\u2019s *your* birthday. If you don\u2019t want to spend it catering to the tastes of a seven year old, then you shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nYea, the kid is probably old enough to remember what fun the day would be, but the kid doesn\u2019t have to go *on your birthday.*   Some *other* day would be just as memorable, fun and special. \n\nIf your parents won\u2019t compromise here, cancel the plans and reservations and go do some adult, fun, overnight things with your boyfriend. NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t being \u201cselfish\u201d, and even if you are, so what?", "NTA, it\u2019s your birthday you will have a totally different experience without handling a 7 year old. Make plans for another family day or tell your Mom she\u2019s on deck and the 7 year old will be her complete responsibility so you and your BF can go do what you like and maybe meet up for lunch.", "NTA. Your mom is being an asshole by trying to add an unnecessary babysitting component to your birthday. If I had to guess, she assumed you'd like the idea and already told your cousin. So you're now the bad guy even though she did the wrong thing.

Why does this one day have to be about the 7 year old?\n\nGo with your friend and leave your parents with the 7 yr old.", "NTA I think you have a very manipulative mother who gets her own way by guilt tripping and using emotional manipulation. Tell her you have decided to have a grown up birthday, so you are just going to spend it with your bf. You need to work on boundaries with your mother. You are 24 but she talks to you like you are turning 18.", "NTA NTA NTA. I AM a Disney Adult, and there is a VERY specific reason I differentiate my trips with adult friends and with my nieces (5f, 17mo f). It\u2019s a COMPLETELY different trip. If your parents are going to accommodate the 7yo\u2019s wishes then by all means. But if it\u2019s a group dynamic and they\u2019re expecting to stick together, your birthday is going to be overshadowed by the young one\u2019s requests.", "NTA, it is your birthday and you don't need to be the baby sitter for your cousin.  They have passes and they can go another day.", "NTA. It is not your son, so you don't have to spend your birthday with him. But if you already told him, you will take him, it can be disapointing. But as you both have annual passes, you could tell him and/or your uncle and aunt the truth. That you want to cellebrat your birthday with your closed family and are afraid it has to be different than you want (with drinking, staying long in the park, etc.) if you have to go with a child. But also maybe offer that you will make up for it and maybe do a cousin only or just you, your boyfriend - if your cousin likes him, and him day at the park one or two weeks later", "NTA\n\nEven if it is \"selfish\" big deal, It's your B-Day you get to be selfish.", "NTA but honestly, it seems like your moms mind is set. I\u2019d go off with your boyfriend and have a good time 1-1", "NAH, honestly. Would your parents not be willing to separate and take him to do the things he wants if there's disagreement on where to go next? You'll have your boyfriend and can meet up with the other 3 when possible.

It's not like this is your nephew's only opportunity to visit the park. On your birthday you should at least get a choice as to with whom you spend it.", "NTA. Honestly, spending a day at a theme park with a 7-year old sounds worse than just not going. It's your special day, I don't think you're being unreasonable. Birthday parties are typically an invite-only thing.", "NTA\n\nI really don't see where there is any \"anti-family\" in your description. If I'm being honest if anything you seem to be more interested in doing something with your family than most people that age do. One way or another, it is totally reasonable to decide how and with whom you want to spend your birthday.\n\nAlso it's not like you invited your whole family except your cousin or something...", "You are NTA for wanting an adult birthday. Your mom is T A for prioritizing her grandchild over you. For heaven's sake: everyone lives close to the park and has passes! And Disney is just as much for adults as it is for kids, especially the fantastic eat-around-the-world events.   \n\n\nI'd focus on that aspect and explain to your mom that you don't want her to miss out on the fun grownup stuff that you are planning to do, since she would be the one to wait in like with the seven-year-old for the kid-oriented stuff that you're not intending to do at all this trip. \"I'm not even going to the Magical Kingdom: I am staying in the Utopian Prototype Community of Tomorrow all day. It's too bad that doesn't sound like fun to you.\"", "***\"My mom says I am being selfish\"***\n\nAnd you are.

Stand your ground.", "You're not paying, and the cousin was already gonna be there except now his parents won't be.\n\nI'm gonna go with NAH. You don't want the kid there, your mom is thinking you're acting like a little kid yourself. \n\nSince this is a family event, I don't think you get to win here unfortunately. You can celebrate without your family and not have to worry about the kids.", "NTA, but there is room for compromise.  Go together,  do what the 7 yr old wants to do first. Then when he starts getting cranky, as 7 yr olds do, have your parents do mellow stuff while you and your bf separate for a bit, then meet up again.  Have the kiddie stuff as your warm up, then off to adulty adventures.\n\nEdited to add... I'm pretty sure you and the bf don't necessarily want ALL your time with the parents.", "That\u2019s a good compromise!", "*I think it would be wise to state that you would rather just NOT GO if you are going to have to baby sit*.\n\nCame here to say this.\n\nI suspect that your mother has already told your aunt that the child can come with your group without his parents, and that is why she is being so nasty about your not wanting to take him, OP.  It's easier for her to bully you than to tell aunt that child can't come after all.\n\nNTA", "That would work to keep the 7 yo entertained, until it comes time to go for adult beverages and they find out the child isn't allowed in there or the cousin is bored and wants to do something fun.  There is a very different vibe when it is only adults.  And the first melt down that the cousin has will change it from the OP adult birthday celebration to a family friendly event.  Neither version is bad, but the OP wants the former.", "Sounds good but it won't work lol. Once you try to go off and do something with just you and your bf, your mom is just going to do the same thing! You're selfish, cold-hearted, \"anti-family\" blah blah. I'd put my foot down on it and say he can only come if his parents come. It's okay to be selfish about what *you* want to do on *your* birthday!", "and make it clear to mom in advance that is the plan. that you guys will meet them for dinner and you know cousin will have an awesome day and your folks.", "And if mom and dad don\u2019t except the compromise, offer to use those annual passes on a different day with your 7yr old cousin. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just another day at the park, it\u2019s your birthday.", "The adult beverages thing and the vibe would still be issues if the parents came *with* their 7 yo though, and OP *wants* that."]}
