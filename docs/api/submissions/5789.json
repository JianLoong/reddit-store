Everything else related to house remodeling he either asks his dad (who has even less experience) or he uses YouTube tutorials. \n\nHe came up to me a few days ago and said he wanted to start remodel on our deck. I told him to wait as we have other bills we need to pay. He started talking about the price of wood and the expansion he wants to do. I made the mistake of mentioning how much a deck contractor would cost. He told me he would never pay someone for something he could do himself. My husband has NEVER done any wood working like this before. I put my foot down and said I wanted it done by professionals. This led to a major argument. He told me I was being stupid with money by wanting a professional and i told him that every project hes done in the house has been a disaster.

To prove a point, he went the day after our fight and bought all this wood and started remodeling the deck while I was at work. Shocker, it looks terrible, it's not finished, and we have a huge snowstorm coming in that's going to soak the untreated/ unstained wood.

He tries to fix the holes but they are never flush with the wall or ceiling. I had to fix the holes in the ceiling because he just never got around to it. \n\nThe tile in the bathroom is sick on linoleum. HE PUT IT OVER THE OLD TILE. It looks terrible and it's already peeling up.\n\nI have holes in my wall that either started out as a project or were damaged that he put drywall in and you can definitely tell there was a hole there. \n\nI have been very patient with everything until now.

Can he really not \"see\" how his clumsy attempts are devaluing and destroying the house?  \n\nHe's just spinning this like you are being mean and unappreciative.\n\nSuggestion:  Hire a home inspector and/or appraiser to come in and do a complete assessment of everything that needs to be repaired or replaced, especially the half-done and badly-done things he did.  Get an appraisal of the house, as is.\n\nMaybe having a neutral party describe what needs done in order to bring the house up to code will be a wake up call to him.  Maybe not.

Not just your equity, which is a big deal when you are living paycheck to paycheck, but also your safe space.

It's something that definitely needs to be done safely and correctly or someone could get seriously hurt. I would've lead with that and used that as the justification. This isn't a new light fixture or tile floor.\n\nAside from that, his shoddy work is probably crashing the resale value of your home and costing you more money in the long run.", "Really, ESH. He's been doing half-assed, half-finished projects for a while, but you've said nothing, so he probably thought he could do the same thing with the deck.
