Amy has been talking about her wedding day for the 20yrs I\u2019ve known her. It was destination wedding in Spain. I brought my partner as a +1, Liz brought her bf of 1 year, Joe (36M) and their 9 month baby boy, Ellis. Amy is very child free, wanted a childfree wedding but made an exception for Liz because she\u2019s her MOH. \n\n\nSitch:\n\nOnce my bridesmaid duties were done, I took a seat next to my partner and Joe. Amy\u2019s culture involves the MOH taking part in some really lovely customs, so Liz was still with her. I was holding Ellis while Joe recorded the MOH & bride ritual. Ellis started fussing and crying and he clearly wanted a parent so I gave him to Joe, who put him in the pushchair. But Ellis carried on crying and Amy was shooting DAGGERS in our direction. I told Joe it was best if he just stepped out of the hall with the baby while the ritual was taking place as it was causing disruption. \n\n\nJoe told me to take the baby as he wanted to keep recording. I told Joe I\u2019d be happy to record for him, but he really needed to be the one to take his baby outside and soothe him. We kind of starting whisper bickering and he finally got pissed off and took Ellis in the pushchair. I took a video of the whole ritual, nothing was missed. \n\nAfter the ceremony part was done, he sulked during the reception and Liz asked for my side of what had happened. I told her and she asked why I couldn\u2019t just take Ellis out since I\u2019m so good with him. I told her I didn\u2019t want to miss Amy\u2019s wedding and she replied that I made her bf and son miss an important moment for her and now Joe was really pissed off and felt like he was \u2018othered.\u2019\n\nAfterwards, Amy sent a message to our group chat saying that she\u2019d specifically said to PLEASE take the baby out of the hall if he cried and it shouldn\u2019t have taken as long as it did. Liz blamed me for not just taking him immediately and waiting for Joe to do it when I knew he was recording. Amy is kind of flicking between both arguments and isn\u2019t sure whose fault it is, she\u2019s just pissed off which is fair enough.\n\n**ETA**\n\nThere was no agreement in place that I would be babysitting Ellis at the wedding. My partner and I had taken Ellis off their hands multiple times over the course of the week so that Liz & Joe could enjoy a date night/sightsee in Spain because I genuinely love Ellis and I\u2019m good with him. He was also a bit sickly that day and the day before and fussed more with me because he clearly wanted mum or dad.", "created_utc": 1670331715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze67e6/aita_for_making_my_friends_bf_leave_a_wedding/", "score": 1459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes it sucks as a parent to miss out on certain things due to your baby, but that's part of the deal. \n\nI don't blame Amy for being pissed. She made an exception for them and Joe had to be a jerk about it instead of just manning up and removing his baby from the wedding per the bride's wishes.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s HIS baby, not yours!!!

Ellis is JOE\u2019S CHILD! Also, Liz and Joe have been together one year and have a 9 month old baby?

FFS.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid, not your responsibility End of discussion. I get that he wanted to record the ritual, but as a PARENT, your child comes first.

Also, why should you have to miss the ceremony because THEIR baby is fussing? They knew beforehand to take the baby out if he started crying so Joe should have been prepared to do so when the moment happened. He could have simply handed you the phone to record and politely walked outside. Sucks he would have to miss the ceremony but I feel like that's only fair if an exception was made for only them to bring their child.\n\nETA- also, who wants to travel all the way to Spain and miss an important part of the wedding because you are taking care of SOMEONE ELSE'S kid????", "NTA not your baby, not your problem", "Easy NTA.

You could have done the video while the father took care of his child. They were out of line.", "NTA - Dad needed to step up. You're not their nanny. \n\nIt all comes off like sexist BS.

Mom's in the wedding, baby gets fussy, Dad takes the baby. Simple as that. Joe needs to get over himself.", "NTA - This was YOUR friend's wedding. You absolutely deserve to be present for that over another friend's partner. Especially since it is HIS child. Joe recording the ritual does not take precedence over you experiencing it first hand.

Why should you miss the wedding, it's HIS kid, not yours!", "NTA.  You did handle it, you went and got the parent and asked them to parent their child.  It was Joe who is the AH for shirking his duties for the video.  The video is important and understandable that Joe would want to be part of it but doesn't override his responsibility to parent his own child particularly when he was close buy.  Now if wasn't there then the judgement would be different but he was so he is the AH.", "NTA In this situation it was 100% on Joe to remove Ellis from the room. Amy is your friend & Ellis is not your child. Even if you were helping out, you shouldn't have to miss any part of your friend's wedding to take care of a child that you didn't bring.

The parents are the ones responsible for handling a child at a child-free wedding.  If they did not want to miss it, they should have gotten someone to watch their child.", "NTA. As a parent of 2, I fully believe that my kids are MY responsibility. ALWAYS. Yes, that sometimes means I have to leave things or feel left out in order to take care of them, but that\u2019s the price of being a parent! (And believe me, the price is SO worth the reward anyway). Joe should have taken care of his child immediately. It\u2019s not your responsibility. \n\nThat being said, I will also note that your duty as a bridesmaid is to help the bride however she needs to make her day go smoothly. Arguing with Joe even via whispers obviously wasn\u2019t the way to do that.", "NTA.

Silliness.", "NtTA his baby his responsibility idk why ppl think its ok to pawn their children off on other ppl", "NTA. This was your friends wedding and Ellis is Joes baby. He should have taken him outside once you gave Ellis to him and let you film. Joe and Ellis could watch the video to see what happened and FGS Ellis who is 9 months old missed nothing.", "NTA. \n\nBetween you and Joe, your presence in the ceremony is more important. It would have mattered more to both you and Amy to be present and witnessing everything. \n\nWhy is Joe and Liz making it all about them??? Being an important moment for her when Amy is the bride here? \n\nNext, when it comes to Ellis, between you and Joe, obviously Joe is the preferred person here because he\u2019s the FATHER. And Ellis was sick and being fussy so all the more he would need his parent. How is their baby YOUR responsibility? And why should you be the one to miss the ceremony when you\u2019ve been Amy\u2019s friend for 20 years when Joe has only been in your lives for 1 year? Wtf?\n\nJoe is throwing a hissy fit and has to grow up because guess what, in this situation, he is the \u2018outsider\u2019 because the fact is that he\u2019s only been Liz\u2019s boyfriend for a year and only known Amy for a year but you\u2019ve been Amy\u2019s friend for 20 years. So he shouldn\u2019t be upset about that. Facts are facts.\n\nAlso, if it was that important for Joe and Liz to have Joe and Ellis witness Liz in the ceremony and not miss anything, then they should have brought a babysitter/nanny because it\u2019s not your job.", "NTA - Not your child, not your responsibility.", "NTA. Why the heck would you want to take a baby to a wedding? Surely they could have arranged a babysitter. Then none of this would have happened. I\u2019m sure Amy is now regretting letting the baby come but it was the father\u2019s responsibility, not yours. He needs to understand life isn\u2019t always going to go to plan with a kid.", "NTA.

As well as a lack of responsibility. \n\nPeople who don't plan ahead with a child are doomed to fail everytime, because it isn't other peoples jobs to look after their child or entertain them because the parents choose not to parent.\n\nI will say you are NTA but also that everyone lacked decision making skills and commnication and Amy was the one to get upset on her wedding day ceremony and that sucks.", "NTA Liz and Joe are. They\u2019re the parents and you\u2019re not the babysitter. \n\nAlthough, to his claim of being \u2018othered\u2019 I do find it odd how you referred to your partner as \u2018partner\u2019 and Joe as \u2018bf of 1 year\u2019.

End of.", "NTA\n\nUnless there was an agreement in place that you'd be the default babysitter, which there wasn't, they are wrong.  \n\nAmy is the one who wanted a child free wedding and made the exception for this one couple.  That's on her.  One parent was busy with the bride, the other was just an asshole to you.  If Liz thinks that you made her b/f and her 1 yr old miss out on a moment of hers (which you recorded,) there is a bigger issue here, it sounds like you were default expected to cater to their needs of babysitting.  Not cool on anyone's part.", "NTA\n\nLiz knew that the bride would have preferred a child free wedding and should have had a plan or hired someone to watch baby at the wedding.\n\nLiz and Joe are parents and I get he didn\u2019t want to miss it, you offered to take over the phone and he could have watched it later, part of being a parent is you end up missing things because of the baby.\n\nPerhaps since you helped out and the assumption probably was made you\u2019d just step in. If you communicated before, hey, I\u2019m here for the wedding too, if baby needs to be attended to, the parents are the ones that need to step up. I\u2019m here as a guest and not babysitter. But it\u2019s wrong for them to assume.\n\nThe bride once she allowed a child, there is the chance that something would have happened that would have interrupted , babies cry, get fussy. \n\nUltimately , the parents are responsible and Joe put his wants over that of his child\u2019s needs, the bride and the rest of the guest.

Yes, Ellis is Joe\u2019s responsibility and Joe should have IMMEDIATELY handed you his phone and taken Ellis out. However, when it became clear that Joe wasn\u2019t going to do that, rather than arguing DURING THE WEDDING and  disrupting the ceremony, you should have taken Ellis out. By arguing about it, you distressed the bride and anyone around you who could hear you over the ceremony.\n\nAnd the lesson here for all involved is to hire a sitter for child-free weddings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When it was time for him to go down the aisle, he got scared from all of the people looking at him, threw the pillow with the rings on the ground, and started crying. It was an outdoor wedding so his dad picked him up under his arm like a football and ran as far and as fast as he could so the kid wouldn't disrupt the wedding (the wailing of the child tapering off into the distance like a cartoon). The best man retrieved the rings from the middle of the aisle, made some silly faces while walking back up to the front to hamm up the comedic value of the moment, and the wedding continued as planned. It's now just a funny anecdote we all enjoy. If the dad hadn't swept in quickly resolved the issue could have gone in a different direction. \n\nJoe put his own desire to observe the ritual over the needs of his child, his wife, the rest of the wedding guests, the bride and groom, and the ritual itself. There is no question that he is TA here.", "Plus, OP has known the bride for 20 years, was in the wedding party, and Joe has known her for a year.

That's 18 months total from having sex to having a 9 month old baby. Even if they had sex the first day of meeting they could not have a 9 month old baby in 12 months. I'm not being a prude I'm just doing the math. Maybe 12 months is not how long they have been together or maybe that doesn't include time they were having sex before being official.

If it was just super new then it might be possible, but they've clearly been together longer than a year or maybe the kid is actually someone else's.

High up in the comments I think we have now gotten to an understand their is a culture of misogyny in this friends group where childcare is something women do and OP should be subservient to Joe's wants.

I hadn't heard that term until now, but from what I gathered, Joe is being extremely overly dramatic.
