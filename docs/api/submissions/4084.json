Amy has been talking about her wedding day for the 20yrs I\u2019ve known her. It was destination wedding in Spain. I brought my partner as a +1, Liz brought her bf of 1 year, Joe (36M) and their 9 month baby boy, Ellis. Amy is very child free, wanted a childfree wedding but made an exception for Liz because she\u2019s her MOH. \n\n\nSitch:\n\nOnce my bridesmaid duties were done, I took a seat next to my partner and Joe. Amy\u2019s culture involves the MOH taking part in some really lovely customs, so Liz was still with her. I was holding Ellis while Joe recorded the MOH & bride ritual. Ellis started fussing and crying and he clearly wanted a parent so I gave him to Joe, who put him in the pushchair. But Ellis carried on crying and Amy was shooting DAGGERS in our direction. I told Joe it was best if he just stepped out of the hall with the baby while the ritual was taking place as it was causing disruption. \n\n\nJoe told me to take the baby as he wanted to keep recording. I told Joe I\u2019d be happy to record for him, but he really needed to be the one to take his baby outside and soothe him. We kind of starting whisper bickering and he finally got pissed off and took Ellis in the pushchair. I took a video of the whole ritual, nothing was missed. \n\nAfter the ceremony part was done, he sulked during the reception and Liz asked for my side of what had happened. I told her and she asked why I couldn\u2019t just take Ellis out since I\u2019m so good with him. I told her I didn\u2019t want to miss Amy\u2019s wedding and she replied that I made her bf and son miss an important moment for her and now Joe was really pissed off and felt like he was \u2018othered.\u2019\n\nAfterwards, Amy sent a message to our group chat saying that she\u2019d specifically said to PLEASE take the baby out of the hall if he cried and it shouldn\u2019t have taken as long as it did. Liz blamed me for not just taking him immediately and waiting for Joe to do it when I knew he was recording. Amy is kind of flicking between both arguments and isn\u2019t sure whose fault it is, she\u2019s just pissed off which is fair enough.\n\n**ETA**\n\nThere was no agreement in place that I would be babysitting Ellis at the wedding. My partner and I had taken Ellis off their hands multiple times over the course of the week so that Liz & Joe could enjoy a date night/sightsee in Spain because I genuinely love Ellis and I\u2019m good with him. He was also a bit sickly that day and the day before and fussed more with me because he clearly wanted mum or dad.", "created_utc": 1670331715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze67e6/aita_for_making_my_friends_bf_leave_a_wedding/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes it sucks as a parent to miss out on certain things due to your baby, but that's part of the deal. \n\nI don't blame Amy for being pissed. She made an exception for them and Joe had to be a jerk about it instead of just manning up and removing his baby from the wedding per the bride's wishes.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s HIS baby, not yours!!!

FFS.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid, not your responsibility End of discussion. I get that he wanted to record the ritual, but as a PARENT, your child comes first.

An exception was made for Liz and Joe to bring their baby to a childfree wedding so Joe should have been respectful enough to take the baby out while he was crying. Also, why should you have to miss the ceremony because THEIR baby is fussing? They knew beforehand to take the baby out if he started crying so Joe should have been prepared to do so when the moment happened. He could have simply handed you the phone to record and politely walked outside. Sucks he would have to miss the ceremony but I feel like that's only fair if an exception was made for only them to bring their child.\n\nETA- also, who wants to travel all the way to Spain and miss an important part of the wedding because you are taking care of SOMEONE ELSE'S kid????", "NTA not your baby, not your problem", "Easy NTA.

You could have done the video while the father took care of his child. They were out of line.", "NTA - Dad needed to step up. You're not their nanny. \n\nIt all comes off like sexist BS.

Mom's in the wedding, baby gets fussy, Dad takes the baby. Simple as that. Joe needs to get over himself.", "NTA - This was YOUR friend's wedding. You absolutely deserve to be present for that over another friend's partner. Especially since it is HIS child. Joe recording the ritual does not take precedence over you experiencing it first hand.

Why should you miss the wedding, it's HIS kid, not yours!", "NTA.  You did handle it, you went and got the parent and asked them to parent their child.  It was Joe who is the AH for shirking his duties for the video.  The video is important and understandable that Joe would want to be part of it but doesn't override his responsibility to parent his own child particularly when he was close buy.  Now if wasn't there then the judgement would be different but he was so he is the AH.", "NTA In this situation it was 100% on Joe to remove Ellis from the room. Amy is your friend & Ellis is not your child. Even if you were helping out, you shouldn't have to miss any part of your friend's wedding to take care of a child that you didn't bring.

The parents are the ones responsible for handling a child at a child-free wedding.  If they did not want to miss it, they should have gotten someone to watch their child.", "NTA. As a parent of 2, I fully believe that my kids are MY responsibility. ALWAYS. Yes, that sometimes means I have to leave things or feel left out in order to take care of them, but that\u2019s the price of being a parent! (And believe me, the price is SO worth the reward anyway). Joe should have taken care of his child immediately. It\u2019s not your responsibility. \n\nThat being said, I will also note that your duty as a bridesmaid is to help the bride however she needs to make her day go smoothly. Arguing with Joe even via whispers obviously wasn\u2019t the way to do that.", "NTA.

Silliness.", "NtTA his baby his responsibility idk why ppl think its ok to pawn their children off on other ppl", "NTA. This was your friends wedding and Ellis is Joes baby. He should have taken him outside once you gave Ellis to him and let you film. Joe and Ellis could watch the video to see what happened and FGS Ellis who is 9 months old missed nothing.", "NTA. \n\nBetween you and Joe, your presence in the ceremony is more important. It would have mattered more to both you and Amy to be present and witnessing everything. \n\nWhy is Joe and Liz making it all about them??? Being an important moment for her when Amy is the bride here? \n\nNext, when it comes to Ellis, between you and Joe, obviously Joe is the preferred person here because he\u2019s the FATHER. And Ellis was sick and being fussy so all the more he would need his parent. How is their baby YOUR responsibility? And why should you be the one to miss the ceremony when you\u2019ve been Amy\u2019s friend for 20 years when Joe has only been in your lives for 1 year? Wtf?\n\nJoe is throwing a hissy fit and has to grow up because guess what, in this situation, he is the \u2018outsider\u2019 because the fact is that he\u2019s only been Liz\u2019s boyfriend for a year and only known Amy for a year but you\u2019ve been Amy\u2019s friend for 20 years. So he shouldn\u2019t be upset about that. Facts are facts.\n\nAlso, if it was that important for Joe and Liz to have Joe and Ellis witness Liz in the ceremony and not miss anything, then they should have brought a babysitter/nanny because it\u2019s not your job.", "NTA - Not your child, not your responsibility.", "NTA. Why the heck would you want to take a baby to a wedding? Surely they could have arranged a babysitter. Then none of this would have happened. I\u2019m sure Amy is now regretting letting the baby come but it was the father\u2019s responsibility, not yours. He needs to understand life isn\u2019t always going to go to plan with a kid.", "NTA.

As well as a lack of responsibility. \n\nPeople who don't plan ahead with a child are doomed to fail everytime, because it isn't other peoples jobs to look after their child or entertain them because the parents choose not to parent.\n\nI will say you are NTA but also that everyone lacked decision making skills and commnication and Amy was the one to get upset on her wedding day ceremony and that sucks.", "NTA Liz and Joe are. They\u2019re the parents and you\u2019re not the babysitter. \n\nAlthough, to his claim of being \u2018othered\u2019 I do find it odd how you referred to your partner as \u2018partner\u2019 and Joe as \u2018bf of 1 year\u2019.

End of.", "NTA\n\nUnless there was an agreement in place that you'd be the default babysitter, which there wasn't, they are wrong.  \n\nAmy is the one who wanted a child free wedding and made the exception for this one couple.  That's on her.  One parent was busy with the bride, the other was just an asshole to you.  If Liz thinks that you made her b/f and her 1 yr old miss out on a moment of hers (which you recorded,) there is a bigger issue here, it sounds like you were default expected to cater to their needs of babysitting.  Not cool on anyone's part.", "NTA\n\nLiz knew that the bride would have preferred a child free wedding and should have had a plan or hired someone to watch baby at the wedding.\n\nLiz and Joe are parents and I get he didn\u2019t want to miss it, you offered to take over the phone and he could have watched it later, part of being a parent is you end up missing things because of the baby.\n\nPerhaps since you helped out and the assumption probably was made you\u2019d just step in. If you communicated before, hey, I\u2019m here for the wedding too, if baby needs to be attended to, the parents are the ones that need to step up. I\u2019m here as a guest and not babysitter. But it\u2019s wrong for them to assume.\n\nThe bride once she allowed a child, there is the chance that something would have happened that would have interrupted , babies cry, get fussy. \n\nUltimately , the parents are responsible and Joe put his wants over that of his child\u2019s needs, the bride and the rest of the guest.

Yes, Ellis is Joe\u2019s responsibility and Joe should have IMMEDIATELY handed you his phone and taken Ellis out. However, when it became clear that Joe wasn\u2019t going to do that, rather than arguing DURING THE WEDDING and  disrupting the ceremony, you should have taken Ellis out. By arguing about it, you distressed the bride and anyone around you who could hear you over the ceremony.\n\nAnd the lesson here for all involved is to hire a sitter for child-free weddings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Joe wasn't even in the wedding party", "My SO is a partner because she\u2019s a woman and that\u2019s how I refer to her. Joe is a bf because he\u2019s a man and that\u2019s how Liz refers to him? would be a bit of a weird attempt to minimise him by calling him\u2026 the thing that he is? Sorry, I might have misunderstood the point you\u2019re trying to make but that\u2019s the reasoning? Not quite sure what else to say?", "Babysitting during the week is totally different than babysitting while trying to be a bridesmaid. They were both completely unfair and it was not a reasonable assumption that you\u2019d be the third parent in their relationship.", "Stop babysitting  completely immediately.  They are taking you for granted and ignoring their own responsibilities.", "This is where I am getting about missing information! You: Black, female, gay. ....Joe: Male, straight. ...You: successful childless empowered woman ...Joe: thinks childcare is women work? ...Amy: caught in the middle?\n\nEdit: Looked at your other posts to try to figure this out and saw some more info. I am on your side that this is obviously Joe's responsibility to watch this child", "Redo the math, a baby takes 9 months to make. If it was 3 months into the relationship it would be a newborn not a nine month old lol.", "Meaning it wouldn\u2019t have been as big of a deal for him to miss the ceremony as it would have been if OP missed the ceremony. She\u2019s known the bride 20 years, he\u2019s only known her 1 year. Not to mean ruin the kids is HIS responsibility, not anyone else\u2019s. OP is NTA", "Just as the other person said. It\u2019s not like he is less of a guest or friend, that\u2019s not what I meant, but he obviously has less relations to the bride or husband", "You're asking what the relevance is of a plus one missing part of a wedding as opposed to a friend of the couple? You don't understand the difference?", "And just because they\u2019ve only been together a year, doesn\u2019t make it frivolous. They are legitimate partners at this point.

But, it's not like she is a stranger, either. Nor, that it was just some party. It was a wedding and a cultural ritual was happening. The child needed to be removed pronto, not sit and bicker over who's kid it is, who's responsible, etc. There was no reason she couldn't have done it. Notice I say COULDN'T, not \"should\", not \"responsible\"... but COULDN'T have done it.", "My sister is dating a woman she calls her \"girlfriend\". I am dating a man I call my \"partner\". I use that term for him because, while we are not married (hence not \"husband\"), we are in a committed long term relationship. A \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" could be of a few months or a few decades. A \"partner\" definitely means long term. While you can use the terms interchangeably, there can be a hierarchy when you use them in the same paragraph for too different people. I interpreted your intention to say your girlfriend is a partner and thus a long time thing. Joe is a boyfriend and maybe not worthy of the title partner?", "Also joe, immediately whines about being \u201cothered\u201d because he, a man, was expected to care for his own child. What a joke.", "The question isn\u2019t related to the concept, as evidenced in my other comments, but looking for clarification over the use of \u2018however\u2019.

Joe promptly placed his son in his pushchair and tried to ignore the situation/force OP to deal with it. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how people will blame a woman for not taking care of a someone else\u2019s child instead of expecting the actual father to do his job.", "I mean idk, I have been with my partner for many years. Liz refers to Joe as her bf, so I refer to him as her bf. They\u2019ve been together a year if that helps?", "You just made up some rules that you live by and are trying to push them on someone else.", "This has nothing to do with her \"being a woman\". \n\nThis has to do with it being a wedding. \n\nYes, OP was a bridesmaid. But, it wasn't HER wedding. SHE wasn't getting married; her friend was. When a kid starts crying during a wedding, you get the kid out as fast as you can. I don't care if it's a man or woman. The wedding going nicely for the bride and groom is paramount over everything else. Yes, instead of doing so, she handed the kid to Joe, NOT getting it out of there. Yes, Joe is also an AH for not getting the kid out of there and putting it in the pushchair. But, his action was secondary to OP not simply getting the kid out herself. It's not like she was some stranger to Liz, Joe and kid. \n\nThe fact the bride was standing there shooting daggers at everyone says it all. It's HER day. Not OP's. Not Joe's. Not Liz's.", "This story seems so cut and dry. Of course Joe should have watched his child. Since they all know you are posting this, ask them if anyone has other information or feels wronged in a way external to this story.", "No, I am trying to clear up a cultural vocabulary because those details matter in and AITA", "By your logic, not HER baby. Baby's dad was right there. And it wasn't HIS wedding either. When the baby started fussing, there was nothing stopping him from IMMEDIATELY stopping what he was doing and taking HIS kid and carrying him out. He just didn't want to. OP's NTA here. Joe is. And the baby's mother for being mad at the wrong person. And for her expectations. \n\nIf Joe had been female, would you have thought that his \"action was secondary\" to OP's?\n\nAlso, if OP had been male and known to the child, would Joe and Liz have still expected OP to take out the child?\n\nEdited.", "You are making it about OP being a woman because you are lambasting HER for not removing a child (that she has ZERO responsibility towards) and excusing the child\u2019s FATHER that was right there next to her and his screaming child. Just because OP is known to the child doesn\u2019t obligate her to take primary care of the child when his parent is both present and able. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you would be making that same demand of OP had she been male. \n\nHis actions weren\u2019t secondary to OP, they were primary because he was in charge of his own child and the mother was busy and couldn\u2019t intervene. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t OP\u2019s wedding but it also wasn\u2019t Joe\u2019s or Liz\u2019s. OP has known the B&G long/well enough to be in the bridal party, while Joe has only been dating Liz for a year and was attending as a +1. It\u2019s illogical to demand that OP leave the wedding to take care of a child, that she has no responsibility for, while Joe stays at the wedding to play with his phone.", "What part of, \"I don't care if it's a man or woman\", did you not understand or read in my comment? Or, that I already said, Joe was also an AH for not taking the kid out when it was handed to him?\n\nNo, it wasn't OP's kid. No, had this been an office party or some other gathering with little importance, did she have any obligation TO take care of the kid. Yes, in that situation, handing the kid to the parent and saying 'you deal with your kid' would have been appropriate. This was a WEDDING. A day special to the bride and groom. THEIR day. And, being close friends, you want THEIR day to go as well as possible. Right? Not sit and bicker over who's kid it is, who's responsible for it, while the kid crying interrupts their wedding. OP had already helped with the kid prior to the wedding, so, it's not like she was some stranger.\n\nThere simply was no good reason she COULDN'T have just taken the kid out until Joe or Liz were able to take over when the kid started crying and kept the interruption to as little as possible. She didn't.", "I'm not even going to dissect your pretzel logic and end with this...\n\nIf I were the bride, who watched NOBODY step up to remove the crying kid interrupting my wedding... then got to watch those same people sit arguing over who was the AH for NOT stepping up to remove the crying kid that interrupted my wedding... I would start ghosting them as friends. ALL OF THEM.", "Op was a bridesmaid, a part of the bridal party. Her responsibility was to tend to the bride. Joe wasn't a member of the bridal party. Lia being mad that \"her bf and her son missed an important moment for her\" when really it's supposed to be a moment for her and the bride that her son and bf had nothing to do with is ridiculous. As Joe wasn't there as any kind of attendant to the wedding party he should be the one taking care of his kid, not a bridesmaid whose job it is to attend the bride. Joe and Lia are selfish for trying to make someone else's event all about their feelings", "Because it\u2019s completely logical to blame other people instead of just the actual parent who is not doing his job. \ud83d\ude44"]}
