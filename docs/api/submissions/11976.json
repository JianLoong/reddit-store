It didn't occur to you to talk to her friends to see if she had mentioned anything or they had plans or a like that?\n\nThe reason I voted YTA instead of ESH is because when this dilemma popped up, you didn't speak to your gf about it at all.

Are they saying her birthday isn't important?\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\nThey told you the day of her birthday... did they think you didn't plan ahead and make plans for your gf already? Pretty sure if they were bestiesil and talked they would've known there were plans. Probably saw on FB that it was her birthday and made a decision last minute. You made a reasonable compromise.", "NTA.\n\nTheir lack of planning does not constitute your emergency.", "Nta.", "Yes, the friend should have contacted OPs girlfriend directly.", "The friends are the ones choosing to keep this a secret.", "The only way to find out what she wants is to ask HER.", "Ouch I feel called out by this comment.", "NTA and way to compromise, although your reasoning of her being a complete stranger at dinner is weird considering you're meeting your best friends gf for the first time \ud83e\udd37\nI would of just added her into the reservation tbh", "NTA. I would ask them why they thought you wouldn't have already made plans for her birthday. Very short sighted on their part.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. They waited until the last minute to say something. They are angry because they didn't get their way. Tell your girlfriend about this if you haven't told her yet. Boundaries need to be set.", "Don\u2019t change your plans, and don\u2019t drop her off with them after dinner.", "NTA, if their surprise was this important they would have teed this up with you well in advance.\n\nIt is a BIT weird that you agreed to a dinner date with another couple (espec. your friend not hers) for your GF's birthday but presumably she didn't object when it was arranged.\n\nComing into town to surprise someone means you risk them HAVING PLANS. The fact that they didn't check with  you until the day of is bizarre", "NTA. Her friends are selfish.", "NTA only children pull that \u201cI have this important thing\u201d last minute. They must have known in advance, and, it\u2019s not going to kill them to wait just a bit longer for her to reunite with her friend. What a bunch of brats", "How about brunch so I can sleep in too...72 yr old", "47-- \"I knew I always thought hermits were cool.\" and also \"I'm not ready for a platonic relationship.\"", "I hate when my bed decides to hurt me. I thought we had a good thing going and it stabs me in the back \ud83e\udd7a", "45 - I prefer my sofa and the company of my two dogs kthanksbye.", "Nta", "NTA but how did it go? Do update us.", "NTA at all", "NTA there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t wait and no reason they are trying to crash your date.", "Info: what\u2019s the gender of the \u201cbest friend\u201d?", "As is OP, who knows and isn't telling.", "\nMy office hallway hurt me yesterday. Seriously. I was walking along minding my own business then suddenly I had a torticollis."]}
