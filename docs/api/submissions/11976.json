This is the first I have heard of this plan. \n\nI tell them that we actually have a dinner reservation tonight that was made ages ago but that I would be able to drop her off anywhere immediately after we finish eating. The dinner reservation is at 18:30 so we won\u2019t be out too late, I thought that was a reasonable offer. \n\nApparently her friends thought otherwise because they did not like my idea and instead suggested many ideas of their own\u2026 Change the reservation to tomorrow? Maybe her friend from out of town can come join the reservation? I said no to those suggestions because it would be inappropriate and impossible to change the reservation and also because my gf\u2019s friend is essentially a stranger to me. At this point they started to try and guilt me into it saying \u201cBut it\u2019s her best friend coming into town from so far away\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s not really a stranger because it\u2019s her best friend\u201d etc. I continued to tell them that this will not work and finally they agreed and coldly told me \u201cDrop her off at home after your important dinner.\u201d \n\nSo now I think all of my gf\u2019s friend are pissed off at me because I wouldn\u2019t compromise for their last minute plan that they sprung on me. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to change my plans to accommodate a stranger? Is it not reasonable to just let us eat supper and then meet her friends for the surprise after?? I don\u2019t understand the big deal with seeing her an hour later and letting us enjoy our dinner in peace, but maybe I\u2019m the asshole.", "created_utc": 1678470746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nvui0/aita_for_not_inviting_someone_ive_never_met_to/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not your fault they waited until the last minute to get their shit together and inform you of their plans. Telling you the day of and expecting you to a) not already have any plans for your gf's birthday, and b) drop what you have planned was foolish on their part.", "NTA Your gf friends are immature spoiled brats. There's no harm in them waiting for you to drop off your gf after dinner.", "NTA. Honestly if I was your gf, I\u2019d be annoyed at my friends for that. Like boohoo, she won\u2019t be able to see y\u2019all tonight, she can\u2019t see y\u2019all tomorrow? It\u2019s their fault for telling you last minute and really they shouldn\u2019t have assumed that she\u2019d be free on that particular night anyway. Not the end of the world.", "NTA\n\nYour GF's friends failed to plan appropriately and tried to screw up your plans with your intimate partner. They are not entitled to ruin your established date with your girlfriend just because they wanted to surprise her. \n\nThey need to *plan better* in the future. They completely failed to realize that your GF might have already made plans before committing to the surprise.", "NTA\n\nIf it's her best friend how do you not know who she is? \n\nYou already have plans that aren't related to her bday, on a day that's not her bday. This is their fault for planning a surprise so late. Surprise! They'll have to wait till after dinner. \n\nBut, you should also consider what your gf would want.", "NTA. GF's friends want it to be a surprise so it's not like you can tell her, because otherwise yeah it would be her decision. You don't have to accomodate to their poorly organized plan, you gave them an appropiate solution.", "NTA\n\nYou offered a compromise. Go have dinner & then have gf\u2019s friends surprise her. Everyone wins. \n\nText her bestie & tell her you will text her at the end of dinner. Her friends can surprise her at the restaurant without interfering with anyone\u2019s plans.", "NTA, this can't have been so last minute that they couldn't even give you a week or so notice?", "NTA. There are AH hints because it looks like you are gatekeeping your gf but you are not because they want to surprise her. It's time to realize the surprise is poorly planned and bound to be ruined at this time and start talking to the Gf.", "NTA.\n\nIf it was that big a deal, they should have arranged this with you weeks in advance.  They waited until the day before you had a plan, and then expected you to just bend to their will.", "NTA but maybe talk it over with your friend and see if he recommends changing the reservation. \n\nIt's your friend's special dinner, but he would understand if plans changed for your GFs birthday. \n\nOnly AHs are GFs friends, because they didn't try to compromise or update their plan once a conflict was made known.", "NTA, while you don't provide ages of everyone involved, i think it's safe to assume you're all adults. As such adults sometimes make plans, and can't be expected to drop those plans for another person to randomly show up. I think your response was great told them you had plans and said you'd be good to drop off later.\n\nIf they had said something sooner maybe you could be arrange to move the reservation, but the day of is way too late. It's not just you and your gf is the other couple too.\n\nThe one thing I'd be concerned with is why would it be needed for her friend to come to dinner tomorrow if you rescheduled, does this best friend have plans to stay with GF or if you live together both of you for the weekend?", "NTA", "NTA but I think you're wrong for not telling her. It's bound to come out and then she's going to get their narrative plus will know that you never told her. I would be more upset about being kept in the dark and about my boyfriend having to deal with my friends being rude to him, than having the surprise ruined.", "Nta. It was a last minute plan. Her friends took the risk that you and your wife may have a conflict when they made a last minute plan without coordinating with your or your wife.", "This should have been your girlfriend's decision.", "INFO\n\nWhy did you not talk to your girlfriend about this? \n\nIt's not really your decision to make...this is classic WE decision not a YOU decision", "ESH both you and her friends are making decisions *for* her without including her. I get that they want to surprise her but then they should have planned ahead of time. But also, you not caring about her friend visiting from out of town just because you don\u2019t personally okie her is selfish. I would have told the friends \u201cyou didn\u2019t plan this far enough in advance. Either I can tell her what you\u2019re planning so she can decide how she wants to spend her time that night or you can accept that you will have to do your surprise after dinner.\u201d", "ESH. The friends should understand that waiting until the last second to make plans might mean that there is a conflict and you shouldn't have unilaterally made this decision for your girlfriend.", "YTA. Her friends should have told you about their plans much earlier than they did, that's completely on them.\n\nWhy did you set up a double date with your best friend and his latest gf on your gfs birthday? It seems selfish that for her birthday, you arranged to meet your best friend. You may not have intended it to be selfish, but it really comes across that way. \n\nDidn't you ask your gf what (if anything) she wanted to do to celebrate? It didn't occur to you to talk to her friends to see if she had mentioned anything or they had plans or a like that?\n\nThe reason I voted YTA instead of ESH is because when this dilemma popped up, you didn't speak to your gf about it at all. You made a unilateral decision based on what you wanted. That's toxic in any relationship.\n\nI hope the birthday girl had a great night out with her friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I may cancel. I don't meet anyone on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. Or Sunday. Monday or Tuesday is afternoon only for lunch, maybe a very early dinner.", "But she was missing 50% of the information.", "They should tell her. I literally do not understand what the fuck it matters if they tell her now or later that her friend is coming.", "Agree completely. Without knowing that, I still think ESH. If it comes out that the gf wouldn't want to know anything at all, I am definitely open to amending it.", "No she wasn't.  When the reservation was made, she had all the relevant info.  The only thing that is changed is the friends decided they want to take her time.  But she already agreed to do something, and the friends aren't willing to tell her. \n\nAs the friends are the ones who want to change the plans, they need to either respect that she had already made plans with her boyfriend, or tell her themselves.  They are putting him in an unfair position.", "\"When the reservation was made she had all the relevant info.\" Annnnnd now she doesn't? \n\nI'm not saying the boyfriend is TA. I agree that the friends just need to grow up and tell her. I agree with you there."]}
