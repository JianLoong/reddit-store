Most classes were combined into multiple grades.\n\nIn my 7th-8th grade class I fell into the \"mean girl\" group. We wore goth-like makeup, smoked cigs we stole from our parents, and told ourselves we were in a girl gang even though the toughest thing we did was flip off passing cars by the road. It was as cringey as you could imagine.\n\nAnyway, there was this boy I'll call Danny (not a real name). He was undersized and just a whiny, annoying boy in general. None of the other boys liked him because he was a tattle-tale.\n\nI guess he developed a crush on someone in my girl group because he would follow us around the school yard at recess, insist on sitting with us on school projects, and just get close at every opportunity.\n\nMy most vivid memory of him was when we were forced to group up during a group project in class.\n\n>Him: (Out of the blue) It's not my fault I'm short because I take pills for my heart.  \n>  \n>Friend: Oh.  \n>  \n>Him: And if I stop then I'll die. You don't want me to **DIE**, do you?  \n>  \n>Us: Awkward silence.  \n>  \n>Finally I said something like: No... just keep taking your pills?  \n>  \n>Him: Maybe I won't! People won't let me sit with them. Maybe I'll just **die**.  \n>  \n>Us: Incredibly awkward silence.  \n>  \n>Me: Just... keep taking your heart pills.\n\nLooking back as an adult it was clearly a cry for help, but as a 12-year-old I knew if I gave him much encouragement at all, he would latch on like a lamprey and never let go.\n\nFinally after Danny following us around the school yard (and us screaming at him to leave us alone), he threatened to tell people we were smoking behind the trees. One of my friends complained to the teacher for him being annoying. Danny was finally moved to another part of the classroom where he latched onto another group, and the cycle began again.\n\nI don't remember gossiping about him afterwards. He was... such a non-entity in my life.\n\nAnyway, fast-forward waaaay too many years. I'm turning 40 soon, y'all. It's been awhile.\n\nSuddenly, I get a message from Danny on Facebook. (Guess he kept taking those heart pills after all.) He reconnected by demanding an apology for all the years of hell I put him through.\n\nI might be the asshole here but there is no way in hell I'm apologizing for not letting him follow us around and be annoying. We were enforcing boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, he had zero friends when even the autistic girl in our class did. It couldn't have been easy for him.\n\nInstinctively, I knew then that if I gave him attention I would never be able to shake free from him. And I don't feel like giving him attention now as an adult. I think I'll just unfriend and block him without a word. He might feel he finally got the opportunity to \"tell me off\", but I don't care.\n\nBut I need the gut check from the internet hive mind.\n\nSo AITA for not apologizing for rejecting the ostracized kid?", "created_utc": 1676317652, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111i37l/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_being_a_middle/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now that you are 40, it seems very odd that he would be reaching out about a middle school issue. I would not get involved and just not respond. Seems like more of an issue that he hasn't moved on and healed from middle school drama more than anything.", "NTA for not apologizing/interacting.\n\nYou're talking about something that happened decades ago. Obviously the two of you remember things differently, which of course makes sense. The tree remembers what the axe forgets. Hopefully getting what he said off his chest will help him heal (especially if he's been holding onto that for all these years), but I don't think you're under any obligation to talk to him about it.", "> He reconnected by demanding an apology for all the years of hell I put him through.\n\nThe fact that he connected with you to demand an apology is all I needed to hear. NTA -- who knows why this is still bothering him all these DECADES later but I think your idea of just avoiding him is a good one.", "Whoa, at first I thougt *OP is thinking about this still?* and then the climax of him actually reaching out and demanding an apology- you were kids.\nI wouldn\u2019t entertain this, it does not sound healthy nor does it sound like anything you need to do for *you* so I am on team-block him and forget all about it. NTA\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Unless there is more you're not telling us, you didn't bully him, you just didn't want to be friends and ended up having to push back fairly hard when he wouldn't take the hint. I feel sorry for him, and it sounds like you do too, but I don't think you have anything to apologize for. \n\nI agree it's best to just block him. Anything you say is likely to open up a can of worms; someone who reaches out after years demanding an apology is not going to be satisfied with a simple \"I'm sorry.\" If you give him any kind of in he's going to go off.", "NTA it seems like you didn\u2019t do anything to bad to him and he was being annoying, unless there something you left out, but it seems like you didn\u2019t do anything too bad, also it\u2019s been over 20 years since thsi happend and you were literal children, he should get over it", "NTA to NAH. This reminds me, in a strange way, of the bit on 30 Rock where Tina Fey's character finds out she wasn't the bullied outcast\u2014she was the bully. You and Danny remember middle school very differently. \n\nI'm more sympathetic to you than some of these commenters; I was the girl being followed around in my friend group in middle school in a remarkably similar situation, and when I finally told the boy off, the girls who usually actually bullied this boy told me off for being too directly mean when he just liked me. Ugh. \n\nWith that said, I don't think you'd be wrong to just block and move on, but a rote \"i'm sorry for however i may have contributed to that\" or something wouldn't hurt either.", "NTA \n\nI was in your shoes. I didn\u2019t actively bully him, but I did make it clear that he\u2019s being highly creepy and I wanted him gone. I might have used very strong language. I absolutely would refuse to apologize. You didn\u2019t bully anyone. You set up boundaries.", "Sounds like he\u2019s basically still chasing you around screaming.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it\u2019s not a 12 year olds responsibility to make sure that another 12 year old has friends. No one is obligated to be friends with someone else", "NTA\n\nAnd don't respond. Something is very wrong with your former classmate. If you're still in contact with your \"mean girl crew\", give them a heads up that they might be next. This is 30 years later - remaining fixated for that long is very disturbing. Whatever it is he wants, its not an apology. And any type of engagement will likely encourage more of whatever he has planned. \n\nI was bullied horribly in elementary and middle school, with some assault thrown in for good measure. As a 40+ adult, I no longer care and was pretty much done with anything actually to do with them by end of freshman year. Therapy for the trauma, but, who tf cares about the stupidity of pre-teens. If I saw them I might not let their kids hang out with mine cuz, that seems... unwise. But as for the individual bullies, I literally could not care less. \n\nI've had a few reach out over the years to apologize. I was pretty uncomfortable with this since this was for them not me, but, I knew they were in AA or going through something difficult so accepted the apology and wished them well. \n\nI would never, in a million years, reach out and demand and apology. There is something really, really off about him.", "So, he was whiny and a tattle tale. He followed around your group, cozied up in an attempt to get the attention of his crush, threatened to tattle on your group\u2019s smoking, and then randomly told you all he was short because of a heart medication. Then, he refused to listen when told to leave you all alone, got moved in the classroom, and began his cycle all over again. Did I read that correctly? \n\nLike all of us, I\u2019m sure there are things you remember quite differently. There are likely times you/your group shut him out and he felt bullied. That does not mean you bullied him. \n\nNTA. \n\nWe have the right to associate with people of our choice. I think Danny felt left out because he was not part of a group. And unfortunately, he reacted to being left out by tattling (which never goes over well with middle school kids). Delete his message and block. You do not owe him an apology, especially an apology that has been demanded.", "NTA. Block and move on.", "NTA. If he approached it differently I might offer something like,  \"ya I was kind of an ass 2 and half decades ago and I'm sorry my behavior hurt you\" but the way you describe it sounds like he's still crying out for attention and I wouldn't want to be involved in that. Personally,  I'd ignore him.", "NTA\n\nHe basically threatened to kill himself if you wouldn't be his friend. \n\nIf you were a grown ass adult, we would all call that abusive and  manipulative", "Reaching out like that sounds a bit like he hasn't changed.\n\nNTA", "NTA and block, you were not mean you enforced boundaries which he didn\u2019t respect", "NTA.\nI came in expecting this to go a different way because I've been the ostracized kid before. It seems he though he could fit in with your group because you were somewhat \"outsiders\", but you didn't have an obligation to be friends with him. I'm sure it sucked for him, but even in that situation, if people tell you to leave them alone you need to leave them alone.\n\n\nYou weren't purposely being cruel or bullying anyone, it doesn't even sound like you were that mean to him. It's strange he would single you out all these years later. Anyway you have no obligation to engage with him as far as I'm concerned.", "Honestly as a kid who was bullied relentless in middle school to the point of being injured, my locker broken into, etc, it doesn't sound like you were mean to him.  You didn't bully him and in fact it sounds like he harassed y'all.  I'm sorry other kids bullied him but you didn't.  Him demanding an apology is ridiculous. \n\nNTA", "For all the people acting like op traumatized this kid in some way... wtf? it sounds like she and her friends were harsh in trying to deal with a kid who wouldnt leave them alone and was unpleasant to be around. I wish id been able to enforce boundaries that well when i was 12. Also, as a 12 year old girl, it was NOT HER RESPONSIBILITY to monitor and modulate this kids emotions. She was 12. she didn't single this kid out (unless she's excluding a lot of relevant info), seek him out to torment, physically hurt him, or even want to be having these interactions with him! saying \"go away\" (even if the words were harsher) isn't bullying. he chose to force his presence on people who didn't want him to be there, and then was surprised pikachu face when they... didn't want him there.  and, again, they were TWELVE YEARS OLD\nNTA", "NTA. It was over 20 years ago.\n He sent you an invite to connect and then demanded an apology- which is rather rude.\n\nWhile you may have been a mean girl as a child, you are not that person anymore. Therefore, if you don't want to apologize, you don't have to.\n\nPersonally, I'd  block him and anyone else who's fixated on middle school and HS drama 20 years later because it suggests he's not very stable.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Based on the examples you gave from what you remember, it doesn\u2019t sound like you bullied Danny. It sounds like you guys just didn\u2019t want to be friends with him, which I don\u2019t think makes you a \u201cmean girl\u201d tbh. Regardless of someone\u2019s setbacks in life, it\u2019s kinda toxic to force kids to be friends with people they just don\u2019t like/vibe with. Maybe it was a little harsh with how you cut ties but from what you recall, he did sound a little obnoxious. A pre-teen isn\u2019t always going to make the best call on how to deal with this stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible he remembers it differently and maybe there was what he perceived to be bullying and his experience is valid. But having been bullied myself, I don\u2019t feel like anyone owes me an apology. That\u2019s kind of weird and self-involved on his part to reach out and demand an apology. It\u2019s not other people\u2019s job to give you inner peace.", "A very weird interaction.\n\n  \nWe're not even the same person we were when we were young adults in University ages, let alone when we were 12.  Everyone at every age is dealing with their own crap the best they can with the tools they have available at the time.  At 12... your tools suck.  Even if you were a bully, a demand for an apology; is this a step in some sobriety program?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would just send some kind of sympathetic response of feeling bad about whatever they are going through in life that brought them to you now in this way and wish them the best in their life.  If I didn't want to open any communication door possibilities I'd say so in the message that where I'm at in life I can't move this far back personally... then block them.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, no one I know from that long ago lives within 1000s of miles of me so... if you share a small town with this person maybe this approach isn't right.\n\n  \nI'll go with:  \nNAH since I have no idea why they send it.. silent block or not you are NTA.", "Nta you have no obligation to apologize from what i have read. You established a boundary which he consistently broke", "NTA. I think I\u2019d consider asking him how you made his life hell. He probably has different memories. On the flip side, it really depends on how much energy you have to deal with this guy rn. You were both children. It\u2019s not your duty to help him get past this, but if you have the time and energy it could be the decent thing to do, or it could turn in to something really annoying with you ending up needing to block him.

I've still got emotional scars from all of that, even though it was 20 years ago.\n\n**However**, I would never reach out to anyone from that time and demand anything or confront them about anything. Because it just wouldn't benefit me. One of the less severe bullies reached out to me at one point to apologize and I just said I appreciated but didn't accept it and wished them the best. But even that did nothing to help me. It doesn't erase the damage that was done.\n\nNow, I'm not at all saying that mine and Danny's situations are comparable. You sound nothing like any of my bullies. I just want to make that clear. If he was bullied, it wasn't by you. My point is simply that even if in **his** mind **you** bullied him, there's really nothing that you could do to help him heal. That has to come from him working through everything in therapy. \n\nIf Danny is still thinking about this to such a level that he needed to contact you to demand something from you then literally no matter what you do it's not going to give him what he seeks/wants. I wouldn't even try if I was you, and would just ignore him and let it go.\n\nYou're NTA. Not now, and not then. \n\nI'm just not willing to say anything specifically about Danny either, because I don't know what he went through. It's not impossible that he was bullied or had a really awful time in school, and his only mistake here is that he's projecting it on you when you weren't the culprit. So I'll remain neutral when it comes to that. But you're not to blame here either and he shouldn't be demanding anything from you to begin with.", "YTA for your description of a child who sounds insecure.", "I don\u2019t care that everyone else thinks you\u2019re NTA, or that I\u2019ll get downvoted to hell. Bullying hurts. It\u2019s traumatic. If it costs you nothing to apologize and put him at ease, then you should do it. He reached out at a time when he was vulnerable and you rejected him. He\u2019s reaching out again, clearly still in pain. I don\u2019t think you should feel guilt as you go through your day-to-day, but you should acknowledge that you caused this person pain. \n\nAnd FWIW, the fact that he described your treatment of him as \u201chell\u201d makes me think you may have been crueler to him than you\u2019re admitting here", "NTA but Why can\u2019t you just apologize for how you treated him? You didn\u2019t sound like a bully, but you sounded like the mean girl you described. Apologize. Move on. Help him move on by admitting you were not nice to him.", "\"he had zero friends when even the autistic girl in our class did.\" \n\nWhat? I was thinking you are not the A-hole until I read this line.  Now I'm going with ESH", "Info: what is wrong with a simple apology over messenger?", "Have you not seen Billy maddison?", "NAH - I am a successful mom of 4 with an amazing partner. My life is everything I thought I'd never have. However I was bullied in middle school and some moments still haunt me to this day. While I'll never reach out to my tormentors, it doesn't mean I haven't fantasized about it. The way he approached you was not ok and you have every right to set boundaries then and now. I say no a holes because part of healing can sometimes be confronting depending on the therapy you're seeking. My own bullies may not have realized the impact but as many have said everyone has their own vantage point. Especially as a child. They are self centered by nature which is normal.", "ESH, clearly there was more to it then you remember if he's still trying to work through it. So no you don't get an automatic pass. I've been the new kid in a situation like that and the mean girls made their victims feel like shit in a 100 different ways. So just own it and apologize,it costs you nothing now!", "Agreed - he seems like an unreasonable person to accommodate. You probably were mean, but you were also in 7th/8th grade. The real issue is that he is reaching out with intensity about this decades later. His mental health is probably not in the best place, and I don't think you engaging with him will be of benefit to either of you.\n\nNTA", "Honestly, I think they did just fine. I don\u2019t know what they could have done better. They didn\u2019t taunt him, they just declined to hang out or encourage him. If there were AH it was the adults in his life who didn\u2019t teach him how to interact better. A situation can hurt without the people being deliberately cruel.", ">The tree remembers what the axe forgets.\n\nThat is a lovely quote, I'll remember it for the future.\n\nThat conversation I outlined (and yelling at him with my friends to stop following us across the school yard field) are the strongest memories I have of him.\n\nOthers are just impressions: I think the boys were actively hostile to him, though I don't remember an instance I could point to. And flashes of his mom constantly coming in for teachers conferences.  (This was a small school so everyone knew everyone's business). If he was actually sick and needed medication, that would make sense in hindsight.\n\nSo there's a lot that's been lost over the years. And of course we're all the heroes of our own stories. Though I could be catty at that age among my friends, I wasn't the type of kid who would pick on another.\n\nI could ask him for specific incidents, but also... that same feeling is hitting me. I don't particularly want to interact with him.", "Eh, just because someone demands an apology doesn\u2019t mean you have to bow down to them. An apology requires an admission of guilt, and if you truly feel that you were just dealing with an aggressive classmate with social issues then why apologize for that?\n\nReaching out exclusively to demand an apology was clearly either a power play or a slightly unhinged person latching onto a few random interactions from decades ago and feeling significantly wronged", "Nah, an insincere blanket apology is worse than just blocking.", ">\"i'm sorry for however i may have contributed to that\" \n\nThat type of apology reeks of insincerity.", ">So, he was whiny and a tattle tale. He followed around your group, cozied up in an attempt to get the attention of his crush, threatened to tattle on your group\u2019s smoking, and then randomly told you all he was short because of a heart medication. Then, he refused to listen when told to leave you all alone, got moved in the classroom, and began his cycle all over again. Did I read that correctly?\n\nYup, switch the heart condition and then threatening to tattle events and you've got it right. (To my memory)\n\nThanks for your input.\n\nI'm just going to tell myself that he went to a different high school (because I don't remember him attending mine and it was a small school) where he learned some social skills and was fabulously popular with good friends. So his ostracization in his k-8 stands out as unusual and cruel. \n\nThe alternative is... not happy.", "Yeah, the more I think about it the more I'm coming around to this point of view. We just didn't have that many interactions (that I remember and... it seems like the sort of thing I would?). But it would make more sense if he was just angry at the entire class.", "The boy in your past seems to be a lot different then \"Danny.\"  Being ambivalent and not bullying him was kindness to him.  He probably knew you were milking him for answers during your CC runs, but it was an interaction with a peer that he probably craved.  I hate FB as much as the next millennial, but it is a handy tool to find people if you have key info.  He maybe doesn't care, but if it weighs on you, spend an hour trying to find him and reach out if you can.", "I'm honestly not sure. I've been on facebook for years (though I only check the account occasionally).\n\nMy hometown is on the edge of a reservation. Back then there were many houses that weren't hooked up to the electrical grid, and a lot of the kids were native (not me, and not him). I'm not sure of the electric situation any more as I moved out and didn't look back at 17, but it's entirely possible a lot of those people aren't on facebook. Or maybe their accounts are private.\n\nSorry this is unsatisfactory. I just don't know, and I don't keep up with the people back then to find out if he's reached out to anyone else.\n\n**Edit**: Forgot to mention my impression was that the boys were actively mean to him though I can't point to a specific incident.", "I don't see how she mocked him as an adult", "How did OP mock him? OP states they haven't responded to him.", ">\"Hi Danny, looks like you've gone on to overcome those middle school days. I'm happy for you. I don't think any of us are still the same people we were back then, and I apologize if difficulties navigating my own pre-teen years caused you pain. I wish you nothing but the best.\"\n\nThis verbage is helpful, thanks. I'm not sure how to word it if I choose to reach out because... I don't think I did anything wrong? At the same time, Jesus, it's been 30 years.\n\nI don't remember him in high school (which is odd because it was a small school). I'm guessing he moved.\n\nBut at the same time... still not sure I want to reach out. It's a little freaky that he has such strong feelings about grammar/middle school years.\n\nI have that same gut feeling I did back when I was a kid: If I give him attention, he won't go away.", ">The \"even the autistic girl had friends\" comment. Damn, girl.\n\nYou didn't ask but what the hell this is an alt so Imma tell a story about the autistic girl. \n\nFirst: I knew her from Kindergarten through senior year, and not ONCE did any adult use the word autism or ever explain to the class why she was so very, very, very odd. She wasn't in the special ed classes.  And since we were in a shitty reservation and it was a shitty time just before dial up, it wasn't like we could google 'hand flapping' and 'hyper fixation'  (she fixated on Russian history for what felt like a year and would fill the ear of anyone who would listen of the rich history of tsars. Funnily enough, I never heard much of anything after Stalin. Her thing was pre-USSR). \n\nSo we all knew there was *something* going on with Lacey (not her real name) but not sure what. That all said... no one was actively mean to her. Sometimes someone would make a snarky comment, but then they'd get slapped down hard by the other girls. Making fun of her just Wasn't Done.\n\nNot that we all hung out with Lacey because she could be a little much on a personal level, but she had her own friend (who was an obsessive horse girl) and I think even a boyfriend in high school. She was sweet and she did well and people generally didn't give her a hard time that I saw.\n\nI dunno. I'm sure we weren't perfect, but looking back I'm proud of my class for that.\n\nThat's why I put that sentence in there. We were all pretty accepting of Lacey even though no one even knew the word 'autistic' or why she was the way she was. Danny, though... well, he was another story.", ">I feel like we're getting only a sliver of the full story.\n\nYeah, I feel the same way! He was just such a... non-entity in my life that I don't recall much of him other than that time he followed my group around, and general impressions of him as a person and his role in the pecking order of the school.\n\nThough I grew up in classes blended by grade, being a year younger (as he was) was still a big deal back then. So I just didn't pay much attention to him.\n\n>He's still clingy, and you're still repulsed and avoidant of it.\n\nThat's it exactly. You've put it into words for me, thanks. It's one of the big reasons I don't even want to ask how he thinks I wronged him. It feels like I won't be able to shake him.", "How is he still clingy? Cause he wants an apology from someone he clearly saw as a bully. I think there is WAY MORE to this than op is saying cause if we believe what she says there no way he reconnecting now, I think she was alot more vile than she says and he possibly had to have years of therapy to get over it. There no way he mentioned his heart problem and these 12 years only said yeah keep taking your pills and she's not even sorry for how she made him feel \"he clearly kept taking his pills\"", "big time. haven't matured or learned anything..", "He might take the blocking as a further slight and it could further stoke his grievances.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you were an actual bully, which is what I think of when I think of a mean girl. You just weren\u2019t particularly kind to an unpopular boy who followed you around. You didn\u2019t tell him to stop taking his heart pills, and it\u2019s hardly your fault you didn\u2019t recognize a cry for help when you were 14 or 15 years old. You\u2019re allowed to not like people without apologizing, it\u2019s only being a tormentor that needs forgiveness in my book. NTA.", "Go with that instinct. It really doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything wrong. It sounds like he\u2019s a Jerry and his life strategy is making people feel so sorry for him and awkward around  him that they give him what he wants because they don\u2019t feel like they can criticize him without seeming heartless. That strategy can be forgiven when you\u2019re a screwed up 12 year old figuring out how get your needs met, but at 40 it\u2019s inexcusable and potentially dangerous for you. He sounds like he could easily become the stalker type. I wouldn\u2019t engage with him at all.", "Follow your gut, don\u2019t engage. He\u2019s an energy vampire. It sounds he had a tough time in life with medical issues and some middle school bullying, and it\u2019s tragic that he was lashing out at people because he felt isolated and alone, but classmates aren\u2019t obliged to provide patient love and support to a random other child. You felt harassed, he was a pest.\n\nI highly suspect that you weren\u2019t the only person he\u2019s sent a message like that to. Don\u2019t feel obligated to interact with this total stranger out of some sense of guilt.", "If you are going to engage, maybe ask him who else he has contacted about middle school.", "Eh, as I said, it might not be something you can answer, so no worries. But I still feel like there's a good chance that he's redirecting his anger to you for whatever reason. I mean, I doubt you were nice to him, but I also doubt you were the sole reason he was unhappy/ostracized at the time. \n\nPart of me is wondering if there's a male entitlement thing going on, like you gatekept him from the girl he liked, so you must be evil, when you were actually protecting the girl he liked from him. That's pure conjecture, though, based on my own HS experience.\n\nETA: NTA. As I said before, I was bullied really badly at the same age, and it has literally never occurred to me to try to track down my bullies on social media and get them to apologize now, because I'm a reasonably well-adjusted adult. No matter what happened in the past, the guy is unhealthily fixating now and you don't need to engage with that.", "[deleted]", "I would guess they mean in the post, and the description given.", "You were clearly never tortured in middle school then. That shit stays with you forever. I thought we all looked up our bullies from time to time. Maybe just me? You're saying you did nothing wrong but also admit to being cruel to him. That's so confusing.  I wouldn't go out of my way to make someone apologize for it 30 years later, because that would be embarrassing, but who knows, maybe a therapist suggested it to him. I still think it's easy to apologize and block. I don't know why you're harping on the attention piece. It's the internet, not someone you see at work everyday. He won't magically appear next to you by responding to a FB message.", "You keep calling him a \u201cnon-entity\u201d and yet you seem to have a lot to say about him\u2026maybe treating him like he doesn\u2019t exist is part of the problem?", "Lmaoooo shut the fuck up dude they were twelve", "A lot of bullies don\u2019t think they\u2019re bullies \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">he sounds like he could easily become the stalker type\n\nThis is exactly what I was thinking.", "If it helps, I was trying to reach back and recall how I thought of him as a 12 year old.\n\nAs an adult I'd use different language: He was lonely, didn't know how to interact with his peers, and every time he tried he'd go overboard and shoot himself in the foot. In a situation where even the special needs kids had a friend, he had none.\n\nAgain, looking back on that conversation I outlined I see it as a cry for help. *Possibly* even a proto \"If you don't be my friend I'll commit suicide\" manipulation. \n\nBack then...
