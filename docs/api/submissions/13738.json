It\u2019s been years and we slowly stopped talking, so it was cool to meet up again. \n\nShe got a huge raise at work and said breakfast was on her. We had a great time catching up. On the way back to the car, a homeless lady asked for spare change and my \u201cfriend\u201d did a complete 180, saying \u201cI don\u2019t give money to druggies,\u201d and kept walking.\n\nI apologized to the lady and gave her a dollar I\u2019ve had forever. I caught up to my \u201cfriend\u201d and asked what that was about. She went on a rant about homeless people taking advantage of the government, doing drugs, not putting in work to get themselves out of their situations, etc. \n\nMy mind was spinning bc this wasn\u2019t the person I knew 8 years ago. I told her I was homeless in 2020 when the pandemic hit, and that she stereotyped the lady. She threw out excuses about how I\u2019m somehow different than \u201cnormal\u201d homeless people. I told her I literally have $17 in the bank because of a procedure where I wasn\u2019t told I had to pay part up front, and that most Americans are one medical bill/car accident away from homelessness. So her saying she\u2019d pay for my meal beforehand was a HUGE help since I have virtually no food and the food pantries here are almost empty. She kept using the same talking points then somehow brought Jesus into it. That was my limit. I told her she\u2019s a terrible excuse for a Christian and got out her car to take the bus home. \n\nShe texted me later saying I could\u2019ve gotten my point across without disrespecting her religion. I just told her to have a good life because clearly we\u2019re not meant to be friends anymore. With the huge raise that she got, she\u2019s forgotten her compassion. I\u2019m not saying she was obligated to give the lady money, but as someone who was homeless and is now food insecure, what she said hurt. Today was my first real meal in weeks, so not only am I still gonna be hungry, but I\u2019ve lost a friend too.", "created_utc": 1680372293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128tukf/aita_for_calling_my_friend_a_terrible_excuse_for/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Glad you tried", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to judge anyone, let alone someone  that you just saw for two seconds outside. Judging someone off there location and appearance is rude and unfortunate", "NTA. Your friend had no idea if the woman was a \"druggie\" or not. And from what I know of the Bible, Jesus would definitely have helped druggies; he said he was here to save the sinners, not the righteous. \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019 (Matthew 25:40).\n\nAnd PS, you weren't \"disrespecting her religion.\" You were saying she doesn't live up to the tenets of her religion.", "NTA.

It shows that you\u2019re not generous because you have so much, you\u2019re generous because *you know what it feels like to be without*.

They take the Bible, cut it up, then paste together the pieces they like to make themselves look and feel good, damming everyone who doesn\u2019t agree with them. Good on your for calling her out", "YOU DIDNT DISRESPECT HER RELIGION!!!

Not that fucking hard.", "Nah that sounds exactly like what a Christian would do lmao", "NTA. There\u2019s a lot of stereotyping here. Certainly not all homeless people are taking advantage of the government, etc, as your former friend seems to think, but not all homeless people are like you, and not all Americans are, as you state, \u201cone medical bill/car accident away from homelessness.\u201d Homeless people are without a home for many reasons, and they can\u2019t be categorized into one simple group. \n\nRegardless, your former friend\u2019s remarks were thoughtless and especially hurtful to you. It\u2019s fine to put an end to this friendship and move on. Edit: It\u2019s never wrong to show compassion, which you did. Jesus always did too.

Fine, ask if you can get them some food or drink or something else. I had a guy respond with \u2018socks\u2019. I couldn\u2019t that evening but the next time I saw him he got his socks.

Your friend is a reasonable representative of their religion.", "NTA and not going to comment about being a good person based on religion. But homeless people have feelings, too, and not all are addicts. The stories I have heard such as how others treat them, even when they are reaching out for help (rehab resources) hospitals just give them a band aid when they need stitches (metaphorically).", "Your quotation marks are saying a lot. I even gave her a hypothetical situation. If I\u2019m qualified to work at her company and if were on the street, would she give me a job interview? She said no. Proved my point. Homeless people have skills like the rest of us housed people. Just no house.", "Exactly. Part of me wants to go find that lady and just talk for a while. I had a teacher who\u2019s brother was a lawyer or something. He got into a car crash, had surgery, got hooked on painkillers, then lost his wife and kids because of the addiction. Homelessness doesn\u2019t happen because of lack of motivation.", "Hell if I were homeless any longer than I was, I would\u2019ve been doing drugs too. Shit.

He was also well known for setting light to prostitutes and making sure that the needy were kept needy and gloated as they starved to death.\n\nAt least, this seems to be the meaning that many people who claim to be Christian interpret from their reading of the bible. Those who *do* read it of course.\n\nRaised Salvationist, atheist since my twenties and an old geezer now. The behaviour your friend displayed is the very antithesis of what I was taught as a kid and wickedly common among far too many of those who 'believe'.\n\nWell done you for having some decency, kindness, empathy and understanding. Whether you are a Christian or not, you showed, first and foremost, your humanity. I commend you, for what it's worth\n\nNTA in the least.", "ESH  \n\n\nYour friend shouldn't have been rude to the woman. And you shouldn't give money to a a woman who may be an addict.

If I had a cent for every time that \"You should give money to charities and not beggars\" had resulted in one of these facebook-level posts about being a heartless shrew, I would have enough to run a soup kitchen of my own.\n\nYou're an idiotic dramaturge, getting asspats from psychos. Get a life.", "NTA. She isn't a good Christian, but she is like many \"Christians\" I know.", "NTA\n\nAnd of course you didn't disrespect her religion.\n\nYou said she wasn't very good at practicing it.", "NTA. Charity is actually one of the most important tenets of Christianity and a great example of Jesus\u2019 selfless love.

I think that people often forget that because they have money now or because their status in society has changed that they're somehow higher than others. I'm glad you were a good enough friend to her to call her out on it and not stay connected to her. It stinks that you lost your friendship but at least maybe now she'll rethink a few things about herself.", "NTA. \u201cChristians\u201d like your ex friend are 100% the reason I stopped being Christian.

It really sucks that so many otherwise decent people hold with that particular prejudice.", "I\u2019m an atheist, and my childhood Vacation Bible School (cheapest childcare my mom could find!) was a long time ago, but I distinctly remember being told that taking care of and loving the poor as our brothers and sisters was something Jesus expected us to do.

I know a lot/most Christians have gone down this path of disdain for the poor, but what they\u2019re doing is literally against the letter of the law of their faith.", "Exactly. It\u2019s complete hypocrisy.", "Same.  Lifelong atheist, but from a Lutheran background. That Jesus fellow was pretty cool. His followers, not necessarily.", "Read some history.  Christians generally don't behave any better than non-Christians and they never have.  Very often they have been worse.", "Is there a Sikh temple near you? They often cook and serve meals to anyone who wants or needs to come, regardless of religion. If you reach out they would likely be happy to deal you when they do so, and can be a huge and non judgmental live saver."]}
