On the way back to the car, a homeless lady asked for spare change and my \u201cfriend\u201d did a complete 180, saying \u201cI don\u2019t give money to druggies,\u201d and kept walking.\n\nI apologized to the lady and gave her a dollar I\u2019ve had forever.

I told her I was homeless in 2020 when the pandemic hit, and that she stereotyped the lady. She threw out excuses about how I\u2019m somehow different than \u201cnormal\u201d homeless people.

You weren\u2019t calling out a religion, you were calling out your friend.", "I'm Christian and trust me your friend is the type of \"Christian\" that gives Christianity a bad name. Jesus always taught to help the homeless and those who are less fortunate than you. Not to mention that there is a verse where Jesus said that he didn't have place to lay his head which would mean that Jesus himself was homeless. A lot of \"Christians\" use it as a title and to be thought of as a good person without having to put the work in to actually follow the teachings of Jesus. If I have extra money, I will give what I can. If it's a charity for a hospital or something that helps people who are less fortunate than me I will donate at least a dollar. I live in a small county so it's rare to see homeless people out on the street but when I do, I give them at least a few coins in not a full dollar as they still need food to eat and water to drink.

If you wanted to keep your friend, try not to attack their character when you perceive a flaw in their personality.", "ETA - yeah your friend is wrong but maybe instead of name calling and throwing a fit about how she chooses to spend her money you actually try to help someone? \n\nYou\u2019d give someone you know a dollar which might help them buy half a cheeseburger but you won\u2019t give a friend the opportunity to change?

Her comment to the woman was unnecessary and rude but you weren\u2019t any better. Just because she\u2019s a Christian doesn\u2019t mean she can just throw money at every needy person. That\u2019s simply financially irresponsible and totally unfeasible.", "NTA\n\nAlso she had to do was tell that lady no. I personally do not give out money to people that approach me on the street or when I am in my car because I don\u2019t like being asked for money from anyone. I just say no or shake my head and move on.", "NTA - By giving the homeless person spare change and chastising your friend about the way she treats homeless people, you were being MUCH more Christ-like than her.", "NTA  \n\n\nSHE is disrespecting her religion. I actually left christianity because I was homeless for over four years and the amount of nastiness and indifference I got from christians was enough to break my faith for good.", "I am confused. You haven't seen her in years, yet she called you out of the blue for breakfast and a catch up?\n\nYou're not actually friends and haven't been for a long time. \n\nYou took her judgement personally and lashed out. You would like to feel self righteous about this so you feel good in general, rather than ashamed because of your current circumstances. Hence this post and desire for everyone to pat you and tell you that despite having nothing at least you're better than this woman. Well, actually both of these women, the panhandler, who statistically likely is on drugs, and your friend who has the successful career, housing security, and enough cash to both travel and eat more than once a week.\n\nI don't really care.

Your friend is a good example of Christian love.", "NTA for standing up for what you believe is right. Bigots need to be called out and what she was doing was very bigoted. Maybe a homeless person that was all those things she said had wronged her but that does not give her the right to treat all or even regard all the same any more than the treatment from one POC gives a person the right to treat all POC as if they will do the same. There are many wonderful examples of Christians that follow the command to treat thy neighbor as thyself, but she wasn't and deserved to be called out. And no, I am not overly religious as I believe in God and Jesus but not in any defined religion, such as Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, JW or Seventh day Adventist, etc. That you can worship God by sitting amidst the splendor of the forest or beside the waterfall as much as going to a man-built church. I believe that I need to be the best I can be and treat people the way I wish to be treated, regardless of color, creed, gender, financial situation, etc. as directed in Mark 12:31 and found as a common thread at the basis of many of the world's religions.", "I'm so sorry for your plight.

As a Christian, she shouldn\u2019t stereotype and judge people for the situation they\u2019re in. In any case a good response would have been to give her some money and leave it on gods hands and he will see what they use it for.", "NTA, but her Christianity is on brand.

NTA, and I hope things begin looking up for you.", "Based on the Biblical teachings of Jesus coupled with this woman\u2019s behavior, yes.", "Some people just don't have the empathy that they think they do. I had a former friend repeatedly extend and retract an offer to sleep on her floor when I was living out of my car with my dog in the dead of winter. She then pretended to check on me just to ask for concert tickets I'd bought months prior and was genuinely shocked / hurt that I dropped out of her wedding and told her to never contact me again. Another would pressure me to talk about what I was going through then called me triggered and made fun of my mental state; was also surprised when I told her to lose my number.", "I think you mean the prosperity-based \"Christianity.\"\n\nThere are many mainstream denominations that run soup kitchens, allow church parking lots for homeless shelters, help folks get rehab or jobs, etc.\n\nDon't paint with too broad a brush, please.", "To get past the anti-Christian biased Redditors have and show them that they are being unnecessarily harsh on their friend.

I guess it\u2019s always been this way!", "Thank you! I have been estranged from them for about 30 years. It's been a very interesting road, but I don't regret going no-contact with them. They offered no help, safety, security or love, so any regrets I have are just about having NO parents, not MY parents.  \n\n\nI don't know about strength, I just want to live. <3"]}
