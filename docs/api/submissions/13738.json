On the way back to the car, a homeless lady asked for spare change and my \u201cfriend\u201d did a complete 180, saying \u201cI don\u2019t give money to druggies,\u201d and kept walking.\n\nI apologized to the lady and gave her a dollar I\u2019ve had forever.

You weren\u2019t calling out a religion, you were calling out your friend.", "I'm Christian and trust me your friend is the type of \"Christian\" that gives Christianity a bad name. Jesus always taught to help the homeless and those who are less fortunate than you. Not to mention that there is a verse where Jesus said that he didn't have place to lay his head which would mean that Jesus himself was homeless. A lot of \"Christians\" use it as a title and to be thought of as a good person without having to put the work in to actually follow the teachings of Jesus. If I have extra money, I will give what I can. If it's a charity for a hospital or something that helps people who are less fortunate than me I will donate at least a dollar. I live in a small county so it's rare to see homeless people out on the street but when I do, I give them at least a few coins in not a full dollar as they still need food to eat and water to drink.

Your friend is a good example of Christian love.", "NTA for standing up for what you believe is right. Bigots need to be called out and what she was doing was very bigoted. Maybe a homeless person that was all those things she said had wronged her but that does not give her the right to treat all or even regard all the same any more than the treatment from one POC gives a person the right to treat all POC as if they will do the same. There are many wonderful examples of Christians that follow the command to treat thy neighbor as thyself, but she wasn't and deserved to be called out. And no, I am not overly religious as I believe in God and Jesus but not in any defined religion, such as Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, JW or Seventh day Adventist, etc. That you can worship God by sitting amidst the splendor of the forest or beside the waterfall as much as going to a man-built church. I believe that I need to be the best I can be and treat people the way I wish to be treated, regardless of color, creed, gender, financial situation, etc. as directed in Mark 12:31 and found as a common thread at the basis of many of the world's religions.", "I'm so sorry for your plight.

Not very loveable.", "I read a book a couple years back that had a really fascinating explanation/theory on religion that I adored. It's a supernatural romance type book but not too explicit. The Demons Muse if anyone's interested. Some great concepts on good vs bad etc.", "I think your situation is actually tougher. Big internet hugs.", "Nobody is obliged to give panhandlers money. She didn\u2019t need to be rude about it, but many panhandlers *are* druggies.\n\nYou gave $1 out of your grand total $18, is that wise?\n\nThe lack of social safety nets in the US is an embarrassment, but this is not your or her job to fix.\n\nIf you *really* feel the need to help, charities make that money go much further than giving to the individuals.\n\nYou\u2019re acting like she personally put those beggars on the streets.", "NTA\n\n>saying I could\u2019ve gotten my point across without disrespecting her religion.\n\nYou were doing *the opposite* of disrespecting her religion! Stating that she's a sorry excuse for a Christian is stating that Christianity is a religion with good ideals.", "You didn't lose a friend that day. You avoided a problem.\n\nYou lost your friend long before you reconnected. Or rather, your friend abandoned who she was.\n\nNTA", "I wish more friends and family would call this out.", "NTA, but remember, there's no hate like Christian love. Love thy neighbour, but only if thy neighbour is the 'right' sort of person.", "It\u2019s amazing how some of the most Christian people are the least Christian people", "You didn\u2019t disrespect her religion. If anyone did then she is the one disrespecting the very religion she claims to practice with her values. You simply pointed it out. She has become a nasty human being and lost sight of what any kind of religion (when practiced as it should be) has at its core which is love and empathy. Unfortunately most religions can be twisted to follow whatever narrative the person practising wants which is why we have extremists and why people like your ex friend can use their faith to justify their own judgmental feelings and be bigots and zealots and many other things and think it is ok because \u2018religion\u2019 is on their side. I am not religious but I have no doubt that if something is out there and they really do judge you on your actions in life I would be fine in whatever afterlife existed because I know I treat people with respect and decency and help whenever I can (and sometimes even when I can\u2019t!) every single day.\nThis person is no loss to you and I really hope that she hears the words you left her with. You are so right in stating how easily everything can change for a person through no fault of their own and if they don\u2019t have the right support then getting back on your feet is nearly impossible. You are definitely NTA.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe already had fed one charity case that day.", "Unfortunately there is a good chance she\u2019s always thought like that and through religion she\u2019s found \u201cjustification\u201d for her thoughts.", "There's literally a passage on the Bible too where Jesus makes much the same argument you are making here, also the bit about doing unto the least of your brothers.\n\nNTA, you are factually correct both theologically and morally. I hope your situation keeps on an upward trajectory.", "Wow. You are so NTA and have real moxie for getting out of her car and telling her to her face she\u2019s a hypocrite. \n\nThat is some kind of logic she\u2019s got. \nFriend: \u201cThese freeloaders should get a job!\u201d \nHey, look. They\u2019re filling out an application at your business. But, they\u2019re homeless. \nYour friend: \u201cFuck \u2018em!\u201d \nAin\u2019t no hate like Christian \u201clove.\u201d", "Lol, the christians today would crucify jesus in a heartbeat if not one of them just shoots him before they even have the chance to put him up there. Feeding the poors? Are you f*cking kidding me? Go to hell jesus. \n\nThe christians nowadays are everything the bible warned us against. There is no other place you can find more false prophets and hypocrites as in a church on an average sunday.\n\nOr like others before stated: there is no hate like christian love.", "This is also the root of things like prosperity gospel as well because Calvinism says that good fortune in this life demonstrates God's favour. \nCalvinism is just a messed up philosophy to allow the greedy to act self righteous.", "I've known 'Christians' who actually believe that it doesn't matter what you do because all you have to do to fix it is pray \"Dear Lord, please forgive my sins.  Amen\" and that immediately fixes it, all is forgiven, the slate is clean for this week, so you can go out and do whatever you want until next Sunday morning and it will be all fixed again.", "What's the funniest to me that basically biblical Jesus said; \"Treat other people the way you want to be treated\"and \"Don't judge other people unless you want to be judged\", among a bunch of other things and the bigots seem to do nothing but judge and anyone they don't think is worthy they treat like trash.", "I could never figure that out.  Why try to force rigid rules on people who are going to Hell under any circumstances?", "Have to give people a chance to damn themselves. Can\u2019t send them to hell if they\u2019ve never heard the good word!", "Not *always* but basically since Christians started becoming a majority in the West around 300-400AD", "I saw a video where someone was going through Jesus\u2019 teachings and basically said canon Jesus was essentially a hippie and that they love canon Jesus, but his fans have ruined his best hits. And I was like huh that\u2019s so true. Canon Jesus said a bunch of teachings that, even as a non Christian who is deeply distrustful of and kind of traumatised by organised monotheism based religions, can totally get behind. Plus he basically is the face of malicious compliance (you want to force me to carry all of your stuff because of laws in place? I will literally go the extra mile so then it\u2019s illegal and you\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Canon Jesus is great). People just pick and choose what parts of the bible to go by - and normally pick the bits that let them appear \u2018godly\u2019 while really being awful to anyone who isn\u2019t acting how they think you should behave, even when there\u2019s nothing in the bible to back their case. Also OP is 1000% right. The friend was not acting in a way Jesus Christ would approve of. NTA."]}
