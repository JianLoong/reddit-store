Proudly trying to pretend it's his boat lol", "NTA. There is no world where I would let a friend take a bunch of strangers out on an expensive piece of property of any kind without supervision. What if someone got hurt or damaged the boat? I guarantee they would say it was entirely your fault and your problem to fix.", "NTA. Your *family* owns the boat, not you, and this so-called friend can go rent one. There\u2019s no way a sensible parent would hand the keys of their boat to a random AH.

This person is not your friend and moving forward, you don't have to waste and time or energy on him\n\n2) I've had boats my entire life.  NOBODY...who is responsible enough to take a boat out by themselves, would ever expect someone to just \"let them borrow\" what I assume is probably a 50-60K wakeboarding boat.  That tells me that letting this guy borrow your boat, would almost assuredly end with the boat being damaged or sunk.\n\n3) Don't cancel the day all together.  Just take other people and do your own thing\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. He is as are his other friends.", "NTA. Your 'friend' is a massive one though.

Time to flush him like the turd he is.  NTA", "Absolutely NTA. I highly doubt I'd ever let anyone use a boat i owned, other than maybe a cheap canoe or kayak. Expensive, and way too much can go wrong. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like that! That's completely messed up...", "NTA.  Clearly he is not your friend.  He is just using you for your boat.", "Shoot... NTA! I wouldn't let someone use my boat (if I had one!) even if they were nice as hell and I just couldn't make it that day. You need to trust someone pretty well with something that expensive.", "NTA. Advice: since it's not just your boat, I would go to the most senior person in your family who does own it (whoever is responsible for paying on the insurance, maintenance, etc.) and tell them about the situation. You need to make sure the boat is secure and can't be \"borrowed\" in the middle of the night...", "NTA, obviously. If your friend asks, I would straight up tell him that you can\u2019t let anyone else take the boat out without owners or family because of liability issues. \n\nAlso, I would dump the friend.", "NTA. And cut this \"friend\" off. You were doing him a favor", "NTA-why would he think you would intrust him with a boat with people being drunk and him being a jerk?", "NTA. It is completely bizarre he thinks that is ok. Who in their right mind thinks that is ok!?", "NTA\n\nWho's going to be responsible for repairs or replacing the boat once they damage it?\n\nHe should be an ex-friend at this point.

I don't know about the others in that friend group, but this guy for sure doesn't need to be around you anymore, even if the others are.\n\nHe had the choice of being a good guy and introducing you to the other group of friends. If he didn't think you'd fit in, he could give you a heads up and still stand by you because THAT is what friends do. \"This is my friend BOX386, guys. It's his boat and he was nice enough to let us join him on it. Come say hi, he's a really nice guy!\" That. That is how you treat a friend that does you a favor.\n\nI'd bar this AH from ever setting foot near me again, and any friends that side with him - you know where they stand and you can ditch them too.\n\nYou deserve friends that appreciate what you bring to a friendship... boat or not.", "NTA.

I am sure you are as tired as I was with people inviting themselves along and not contributing to gas, food, etc. but I would never let someone take my boat out without me and especially when they point out that they want to exclude me.\n\nThis is why it costs $500.00 or more a day to rent a boat in some places...they can do that and invite whomever they chose.  I am sorry you have such shitty friends.", "NTA.\n\nexcluding the person who owns the boat and is allowing you to use their boat is very rude. like they're doing you a favor and you dont even have the decency to invite them on their own boat. thats crazy. and saying OP's not part of the friend group is dumb because OP can make new friends.", "That is no friend of yours and that you are nice enough to buy snacks and drinks...which you shouldn't anymore.

Totally and completely NTA\n\nIt's your family's boat, it's a totally AH move to want the boat eithout you.\n\nFurthermore, the liability issues, Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster the insurance and liability issues.

My husband and I used to have a big party boat and one day, a friend of mine called and said that she and some friends and family had a big trip planned at a lake in our state and she asked if she could not only borrow our boat but also our big towing vehicle.  I said sure, we'd love to come and join them and that's when she told me that we were not invited but could she still borrow our boat and SUV.
