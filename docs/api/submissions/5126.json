He lied and said it\u2019s his boat.", "Indeed, do this, but screenshot the texts first and toss it in the group chat so he can't claim some other bullshit for why it's happening.", "This is such a sad story. Those last few minutes of video footage as Mallory and Anthony were walking towards the boat at the marina breaks my heart. You could see the love between the two and how genuine it was. Anthony says how much Mallory changed him for the better. I could never fathom being responsible for a close friends death because of my carelessness and callous behavior. Not to mention that Alex Murdaugh,the actual owner of the boat, is a straight up sociopath. His trial begins late January 2023 and I'll be watching the trial. I whole heartedly believe he killed Paul and Maggie to cover up/protect his money. Maggie supposedly visited a divorce lawyer at least a week prior and he was being sued due to the boat accident. The boat accident is what caused the Murdaugh dynasty to implode.", "Probably said the boat was his instead of OP\u2019s. Such a weird thing to do otherwise.", "There you are. I've been looking for you. :)\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Wow.", "This guy is NOT your friend. He's someone that buddied up to you, with the intention of using you. \n\n  He's not a guy with $$, right? But he wants to pretend to be rich by \"borrowing\" your family's boat.  HE IS A USER and that's all he will ever be.", "I want the boat, I want pet fish", "NTA... that's a rude friend, not friend", "\"Sure thing dude, and while you're out on my boat I assume I can have your house keys and throw a party yes? But please don't come back too early, I don't want you at the party\"\n\nNTA \ud83d\ude05", "NTA and wouldn't that be illegal?  I'm assuming none of the non-boat owners have a license, let alone insurance?  \n\nWhat an absolute nut!  \n\nSounds like the perfect way to get your boat flipped in the middle of the lake.", "\u201cFine this is a business transaction then if i\u2019m not invited. You owe me this amount for using my boat along with a deposit for insurance in case you do any damages to my boat.\u201d", "NTA - this person is NOT your friend.", "NTA. What's next, host a party at your place and ask you not to be there? Boat rentals exist. If he wants a boat, he can rent one.", "NTA!! omg\n\n*Of course* you'd be going! IT'S YOUR FAMILY'S PROPERTY. Geez. That's some nerve he's got.\n\nThis person is not your friend. I'm sorry they treated your generosity in this way. Not everyone is an AH, but they are. There are much better friends out there for you. You sound awesome.", "As a former boat owner (hallelujah) NTA.\n\nAbsolutely hell no would I let anyone borrow my boat, or my jet skis. That is a damn disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA why would ANYONE think they can just go off in someone's expensive boat? They want a boat minus you, they should rent one like normal adults. There wasn't a need to shit on you in this either.", "Lol I would reply and say \"well you're not part of this family and so we don't want you on our family boat\". \n\nWhat a dick. NTA.", "We have a 70's Glastron w 55 Merc runabout. Ain't worth shite. Don't matter.\nNo one drives my boat nor takes my boat out without me on it. Nevermind something expensive like what OP is talking about. NTA", "NTA Your \"friend\" is using you to have access to a free boat. He doesn't want to spend time with you, he wants to show off to his friends that he has connections to a free boat. I can't believe he had the nerve to ask this. Tell him to go rent a boat. Why should your family take on liability for something happening when none of you are there? You should not take the risk when there is no reward.", "NTA and this person is not your friend.", "NTA.\n\nHe's taking advantage and he'll I would never just let him take the boat without someone of the family there. What if there's an accident and someone gets harmed? Your family might be liable if you weren't there and insurance if you have one might refuse to pay.\n\nHe's also a jerk for excluding you and \"not wanting you there\" when it's YOUR damn boat. He's a rude AH.", "Dafuq??\n\nNTA... time to ditch this \"friend\"?\n\nMaybe double check that someone didn't borrow / steal his phone first... cuz its hard to believe its true...", "Are you serious, your that gullible..no wonder why he takes advantage of you", "You would have been a chump to let him use your boat.  NTA\n\nThis guy is not your friend, block him and get a better one.\n\nAlso, never lend out something like a boat unless you're so rich that you can eat any damage that happens and don't care if they wreck it.", "OMG! Totally not the NTA. And I can't imagine your parents would be cool with it. I would never let my kids friend borrow something like that. The insurance and liability alone gives me anxiety. Cut that friend out of your life ASAP.\n\nEdit: and if it is your boat and not your parents, same applies. I was not sure what you meant by family, but it doesn't matter.\n\nThis friend's situation does not matter. Let the jerk buy their own boat AND never let him on your boat again.", "Cut the breaks", "Definitely NTA. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. Honestly, I would take it one further and never invite this \"friend\" on the boat anymore even with your shared friend group.", "NTA and I'd make it obvious that you're not friends anymore and why. State it loud and clear that the reason you're no longer friends is because he felt entitled to your family's expensive property without you there to take care of said property. If he makes a big deal ask him if he'd pay for the cost of the boat of something were to happen to it because no one was there to take care of it. I'd screenshot it as well so he can't turn your mutual friends against you.", "NTA, fuck that guy that doesn't sound like a friend to me.", "NTA. I\u2019d treat as a business transaction in that case. Pay to rent the boat and leave a credit card number in case of any damages.", "Absolutely not! Find a new friend.  This is beyond forward.", "NTA. I won't even let friends and some family drive my car. A boat is so much more responsibility.", "NTA.  No one borrows the boat.  Not to mention he was incredibly rude.  Say goodbye to that friend.", "NTA. You even have to ask this? You're under zero obligation to let anyone use your boat. Tell friend you're gonna borrow his car and take it to the local midnight street races, but he can't come because that's not his scene. See how that goes down. It's the same thing. Dude has some brass balls.", "Yeah, boats are expensive. (Break out another thousand)\n\nNo possible way I'd let someone take it out, unless I knew and trusted them an awful lot. Our boat is 50 years old, and a fun little rat, that is literally three slow boat to china, and I still wouldn't lend it out.\n\nBesides, everyone knows the guests bring snacks and drinks.\n\nThis guy is nuts", "I learned how to drive our boat years ago and being a little people, I can never see over the bow until the trim drops so I prefer to be a passenger. There's a lot to master and it's completely different than driving a car.", "Yeah, well I wouldn't lend my car to someone who says \"we don't want you here\" either i think.", "This is only just starting to be implemented in the US. When I was a kid (late 90s, early 00s) I was allowed to drive the boat no matter what. Even some Fish and Wildlife folks complimented me at like age 6 on how well I was driving the boat. I grew up on the Columbia River."]}
