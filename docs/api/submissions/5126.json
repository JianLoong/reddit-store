How incredibly rude and mean. Also, as a boat owner, there's no way I'd trust a group of random people take out my boat without either me or someone I trusted a LOT.", "Nta. Your 'friend' is. Proudly trying to pretend it's his boat lol", "NTA. There is no world where I would let a friend take a bunch of strangers out on an expensive piece of property of any kind without supervision. What if someone got hurt or damaged the boat? I guarantee they would say it was entirely your fault and your problem to fix.", "NTA. Your *family* owns the boat, not you, and this so-called friend can go rent one. There\u2019s no way a sensible parent would hand the keys of their boat to a random AH. Think about the liability issues, if nothing else.", "Seriously NTA. And I\u2019d re think about this friend. Sounds like he\u2019s trying to use you. So he can look cool.", "NTA - that\u2019s messed up. Do not let him and his friends on your boat. Especially without you being there. But preferably never.", "He ain't ur friend them", "NTA & for liability/insurance reasons, he shouldn't have free access to your boat without an owner present.", "1) Congrats.  This person is not your friend and moving forward, you don't have to waste and time or energy on him\n\n2) I've had boats my entire life.  NOBODY...who is responsible enough to take a boat out by themselves, would ever expect someone to just \"let them borrow\" what I assume is probably a 50-60K wakeboarding boat.  That tells me that letting this guy borrow your boat, would almost assuredly end with the boat being damaged or sunk.\n\n3) Don't cancel the day all together.  Just take other people and do your own thing\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. He is as are his other friends.", "NTA. Your 'friend' is a massive one though. He was happy to let you assume you'd come, until it was all arranged. Probably figured you'd bow out and still allow them to use the boat.   \nI wouldn't let people (especially people I don't know) use my boat without being there myself either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Time to flush him like the turd he is.  NTA", "Absolutely NTA. I highly doubt I'd ever let anyone use a boat i owned, other than maybe a cheap canoe or kayak. Expensive, and way too much can go wrong. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like that! That's completely messed up...", "NTA.  Clearly he is not your friend.  He is just using you for your boat.", "Shoot... NTA! I wouldn't let someone use my boat (if I had one!) even if they were nice as hell and I just couldn't make it that day. You need to trust someone pretty well with something that expensive.", "NTA. Advice: since it's not just your boat, I would go to the most senior person in your family who does own it (whoever is responsible for paying on the insurance, maintenance, etc.) and tell them about the situation. You need to make sure the boat is secure and can't be \"borrowed\" in the middle of the night...", "NTA, obviously. If your friend asks, I would straight up tell him that you can\u2019t let anyone else take the boat out without owners or family because of liability issues. \n\nAlso, I would dump the friend.", "NTA. And cut this \"friend\" off. You were doing him a favor", "NTA-why would he think you would intrust him with a boat with people being drunk and him being a jerk?", "NTA. It is completely bizarre he thinks that is ok. Who in their right mind thinks that is ok!?", "NTA\n\nWho's going to be responsible for repairs or replacing the boat once they damage it?\n\nHe should be an ex-friend at this point. He had the audacity to ask for your boat and tell you they don't want you there. Naaah, bro.", "NTA - he tried to use you for your boat then kick you out of the event? HA. HAHAHAHA. HA HA HA HA. Not happening.\n\nI know you may not like hearing this but this dude is not your friend. I don't know about the others in that friend group, but this guy for sure doesn't need to be around you anymore, even if the others are.\n\nHe had the choice of being a good guy and introducing you to the other group of friends. If he didn't think you'd fit in, he could give you a heads up and still stand by you because THAT is what friends do. \"This is my friend BOX386, guys. It's his boat and he was nice enough to let us join him on it. Come say hi, he's a really nice guy!\" That. That is how you treat a friend that does you a favor.\n\nI'd bar this AH from ever setting foot near me again, and any friends that side with him - you know where they stand and you can ditch them too.\n\nYou deserve friends that appreciate what you bring to a friendship... boat or not.", "NTA. Please realize this person is NOT your friend.", "YTA - I just watched White Lotus and all this post made me think of was the rich doosh who spends all of season 1 throwing a fit about the room his mommy booked.
