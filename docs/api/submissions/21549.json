Overall I think your parents are the assholes.", "ESH", "Given the circumstances only in this case, NTA. But save yourself some hassle and see if you can get a portable door lock off Amazon, so you can get some peace whilst you\u2019re in your room, and so you don\u2019t have to resort to hamster-napping again.", "NTA. Hopefully she learnt her lesson.", "Not even touching the sibbling rivalry here, but you and your gf are definitely AHs for treating the body of her hamster as a prop for a prank.

You\u2019ve traumatised your 11yr old sister with a dead hamster congrats. Of course everyone is giving you the cold shoulder you took it too far, you could have used the same pranks on her - dosing her with soda when she\u2019s asleep/being generally annoying. You took it from soda pranks to dead pet trauma. You want to be proud of what you did then take the consequences that your family will view you differently, especially your sister. There were better ways to handle what happened and your parents are the main people at fault for letting you both run wild with no guidance. Imagine if it was your dog? They convinced you your dog was dead, even brought a dead dog that looked like yours, would you feel that was justified retaliation for pouring soda on you?\n\nYou got what you wanted, there will be no more pranks and as it was done in such an extreme way you have to accept that you sister will never have the same relationship with you. She\u2019s 11 and you used dead animals to traumatise her.", "NTA\n\nKids need discipline and not being disciplined for things like pouring soda over someone\u2026 yikes", "NTA. I hate practical jokes. They are usually mean and not funny. I give you a \"not guilty\" on this one on grounds of self defense. \n\nI admit, I did LOL. That was sooo wrong of me.", "NTA Since your parents aren't going to teach sis about real world consequences, it's good if you to help her out.", "NTA. Nice work!

They don\u2019t seem to parent.", "Agreed, no harm was caused. Sister just realised what you are capable of, and that she should leave you alone. \n\nSadly in life you sometimes have to demonstrate to people that you shouldn't be fucked with. \n\nA lot of people also would have used violence against a sibling so yknow...good job", "I don\u2019t know why you guys want him to stoop to her level so bad or worse, beneath her. I mean the nature of the \u201cpranks\u201d tell you that. Her idea of a prank is pouring soda on him and his is doing\u2026this? It just seems like it\u2019s too far. It is too cruel spirited given their age/maturity difference. He\u2019s watching his fourth grader sister sob over an (assumed) dead pet and is laughing over it. I find that far more disturbing then an 11 year old letting the dog out or pouring soda on someone. His intent is more malicious because he is more emotionally mature.", "NTA, but a 16 year old dating a 19 year old? What? And the sister is an asshole.", "Indeed, I'm quite impressed by the solution. It might be a harsh one, but much better than I've generally witnessed in life (e.g. he would have beaten her).\n\nOP's sister definitely need to feel some real boundaries in her life though, since she doesn't seem to realize how social life works.

Maybe not all of them, but these types of pranks go beyond \"lol oops I didn't know any better\" \n\nThat said OPs response was extreme, I understand why because his parents are being shits but still, let's not pretend that the two girls just didn't know any better. They did", "Well, now that you said it? INFO: dear OP, what is this ? Spare us adults the regular talk of we're in love and she ain't like that and blah blah blah. Why are you dating a 19 years old?", "16 - 19 could easily be a high school senior that stayed back once dating a sophomore.  Not that unrealistic.   16-18 happens all the time.", "The Parents are the worst, they know their 11year old is running around with a knife opening doors probably damaging them in the process and don\u2019t intervene?\n\n(don\u2019t know how sturdy American doors are but if you tried that with a German door you would definitely have scratches and dents in the frame before you could open them)", "Right? A prank was warranted but putting a dead pet in the cage was horrific.", "Cannot believe these comments. I\u2019d be devastated if someone faked the death of my beloved pet.

However, I think the response was a buildup of frustration from them (and his parents) repeatedly ignoring his requests for the pranks to stop.\n\nYes, he took it too far, but the 11 year old needs to learn she can\u2019t pester people indefinitely without consequence. The parents are the AH because they should have stepped in when OP first asked them too.", ">His intent is more malicious because he is more emotionally mature.\n\nHis intent is more malicious because it's not just a prank, it's revenge and meant to teach her a lesson.", "There is nothing that said that she loves her hamster that much", "Because, surprise, not everyone is in the US.

They are hollow on the inside and the knife trick will work easily on many doors though not all. Some interior doors can be opened by a card. The knife probably would leave some scratches but not much cause the lock won't give much resistance. \n\nIt's normally mostly exterior doors that are heavier and much harder to bypass the lock. And of course things like hotel doors are made a bit more secure as well since you don't want someone breaking into your hotel room. In a way this is good cause in the event of a fire an interior door won't be too hard for a fireman to break through especially if they have an ace.", "I'm going to stand by my vote, regardless of the downvotes. This was really taking it too far. OP could have fought fire with fire - sister pours slime on him, he can do it to her. Etc. This was an unnecessary escalation.", "Yeah the parents suck no doubt. I would've voted NTA but his prank went a little too far for me I guess.", "Laugh, because a little kid playing a game where they try to mess with your nap is funny? Why is he so fragile? Or he could stop napping? Or put a wedge in his door?\n\nHe tattles to his parents because... his little sister is messing with his nap? Is this serious? He really can't deal with this? What is it going to be when life has some actual adversity? Even his parents told him he's being a child and to deal with the problem himself. They surely didn't mean to start dealing with dead animals. You don't try to out-prank an 11-year-old, that's just messed up.", "Oh yikes! I missed that. I don't think it makes OP more manly, but I don't think it influences my judgement.\n\nExcept maybe my judgement about these parents. Letting their daughter stomp over people's boundaries with a shrug of \"it's a prank war\" is bad enough, shouldn't they look into this legal adult dating their minor son?", "TBH the entire story doesn't ring true to me.", "I think he calls her \"girlfriend\", while she's just the babysitter.", "God I hope its a typo", "Pranks can be used as revenge or to teach someone a lesson.

Japan has recently updated their age of consent - it's now 16. Even prior to the update, only ona few (I think it was 2) prefectures in Japan actually kept the age at 13 - most other prefectures had an age of consent from 16 to 20. The law change was recent so I'm not actually sure if the old ages are still in place - the previous one was a \"minimum for the whole country but specific prefectures can raise the age\".\n\n\nSome countries also have Romeo and Julliet laws which basically state that, in a certain range of ages (usually 15/16-18), you can be in a relationship with someone up to 2 years older than you.

Of all the things he could have done, he takes an actual dead hamster, shows it to her, and is like \"this is yours... Haha jk it was a prank!\" ??? Had he done something not as extreme I would've said ESH.\n\nParent should've stepped in sooner and not have let this behavior continued. And telling him to deal with is bullshit. They're the parents they should act like it. \nAnd I dont blame OP for wanting to get back at her, but there is a million other things he could've done before this.\n\nAnd yes, OP's sister is going to have to experience the loss of her hamster at some point, but she didn't have to experience it now. This caused her unnecessary grief."]}
