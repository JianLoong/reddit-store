They've also let my dog out of my room knowing he isn't supposed to be out and countless other bullshit.\n\nI've told my parents and they just tell me to be a man about it and suck it up. I've tried locking my door but they have some trick where they put a knife in-between my door and jam it open.\n\nI told Reece if she ever did another one on me, she'd fucking regret it and wouldn't like the outcome.

Your sister sounds like a menace, but faking the death of a child\u2019s beloved pet is not cool. That said, I feel like the adults in this situation were also very much in the wrong, because you did try to get them to deal with the issue first, and being told to \u2018man up\u2019 about something that\u2019s clearly bothering you is pretty crappy. Also, I\u2019d say your sister has moved past just \u2018pranks\u2019 if she\u2019s breaking into your locked room, which is a definite invasion of privacy. If your parents aren\u2019t aware of that one, be sure to explain it to them (and if they are aware and still told you to \u2018suck it up,\u2019 they\u2019re even crappier than I first thought).", "ESH\n\nThe pranks are annoying but at the end of the day they are children and you are a 16 year old. The parents are near neglectful based on the lack of action and they also seem to be misandrists. The ones least bad are the children. Their actions are not fully understood at that age, especially if the parents haven't raised them correctly. That 'prank' is downright traumatizing to a young child. You should know better.", "Meh you all seem like jerks but seems like problem solved.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. Here is why - \nThe brain and mental development for a 11 year old female consists of: understanding and considering other peoples point of views and no longer only their own; understanding how their behavior affects others; a developed sense of right and wrong; \n\nYour sister, despite her young age, was completely capable of recognizing the fact that you were not amused by her pranks. And, as you said, you gave her a warning and a final chance for her to stop. Which she didn\u2019t. \n\nAnd as they say, don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it.", "That's really going for the jugular, there, but it's hard for me to judge you too much since it seems like they have made a point of tormenting you for a while and nobody else is doing anything to help you.\n\n1. I can't believe your parents just told you to be a man about it and suck it up.\n2. I don't share your certainty that she'll never screw with you again.\n\nI'm going to say a tentative NTA.", "NTA.  Your sister is going to be a handful when she grows up.  \n\n---\n\nI'm skipping ESH/YTA because the parents and the sister are the problem.  OP is some 16-year-old man trying to deal with his boundaries not being respected.\n\nWas it childish? Meh no one was hurt.  OP's sister is doing more damage than OP is.", "[deleted]", "I'm going to go with YTA. That's not a prank, that's just cruel. Your sister is a child, you are closer to adulthood than being considered young enough to do stupid stuff like this. The death of a pet is hard enough to deal with on its own. This is extremely traumatising for someone.", "Y T A\n\nMaking someone, especially a child, think that their pet died is not a prank. And to let her believe her hamster was dead for half an hour?? It's just cruel.\n\nPranks are for having fun. If it causes harm to someone then it's not a prank.", "Yta", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TAH but I do think you\u2019re a jerk. You could\u2019ve put blue dye in her shampoo or used disappearing ink on her favorite outfit or something to that effect. As a parent, you took it too far. However I\u2019m upset by your parents complete lack of discipline where your sister is concerned. NTAH but you could\u2019ve done something different for payback.", "YTA. \n\nI'm still trying to comprehend... Your sister is 11... you are 16 with a 19yo gf... you pull this traumatic prank and then brag about it on the internet...  your parents dont punish you...\n\nAll I can say is that your parents have clearly failed you both, and all I can do is hope that your sister gets her revenge one day.", "Pulling a prank is almost an automatic Y T A.\n\nThe stunt you pulled was horrendous and would normally also get you Y T A.\n\nHowever, the girls were merciless in tormenting you and your parents just shrugged it off.\n\nThe normal way to stop it would be physical violence. You didn't do that. Instead, you gave them a warning and delivered on that warning when they didn't stop tormenting you.\n\nWhat you did was so awful and shocking to them that you left them in fear about what your next retaliation might be. You may have given them sufficient respect for your determination to supply consequences.\n\nYou avoided violence, you were driven to your limit, and your parents totally failed you. **NTA** for your solution.", "YTA.\n\nThe pranks your sister pulls are annoying and juvenile. She's probably doing it because you react so perfectly - it's amusing to her. Definitely your parents should have stepped in, they're useless. As a 16yo you could've been naked and masturbating in your locked room which I'm sure they don't want your 11yo sister to see.\n\nBut what you did was sick and twisted. That's why people are giving you the cold shoulder. It was too far. I dunno what your relationship with your sister is going to be like moving forward, but maybe you don't care.", "YTA, this is horrendous. Grief isn't a funny prank; you should know better. When you are older and a beloved pet of yours dies you will remember this and regret it. \n\nOn a side note, what the hell is wrong with your GF for having a week-old dead hamster lying around? WT-everloving-F, dude?!", "Hahahahaha NTAH, you warned her. Sometimes some kids just need a taste of their own medicine\ud83e\udd23", "YTA. Don\u2019t play with peoples emotions. Pranks are to be funny for all parties involved.", "F the ppl saying \"YTA\". Good one, stay true to your word. NTA \ud83e\udd23", "For fucks sake ofc YTA. That is actively cruel. How would you feel if she did that with your dog? \n\nShe\u2019s a child. She might be annoying you, and mean, but she hasn\u2019t done anything nearly equivalent with *convincing her her beloved pet is dead*. \n\n\u201cBe a man about it\u201d is bullshit advice but, given the quality of parenting in this post, I\u2019m really not surprised you think this is okay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
