I feel like him taking away your ONLY card and then refusing to drive 20 mins to give it back is his way of flexing some sort of control over you and to leave you feeling vulnerable. Don\u2019t just lock the card, but replace it completely. Some banks will give you a digital card to use right away if you have a smart phone.

You don't tell him every little detail about what you get up to when he's not around because it's none of his business.

Since there's no way this was actually an accident, you may fear he'll take your card again if he doesn't feel like you'll need it and you'll be more likely to tell him what your plans are when he asks, regardless of it being any of his business or not.\n\nYou are NTA, but if you don't break up with this guy, you'll be TA to yourself.", "Maestro and Vpay seem to both have credit card style numbers now.
