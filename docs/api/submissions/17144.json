You can go with a theme but try to stick to 3 similar colors.\n\nGo home and cut them out into shapes. They can be hearts, flowers, polka dots!

It'll make it easier to clean up after) and stick the designs over the walls. You can cut up samples to make confetti (only if you clean it up after!) or letters to make a message on the wall!

Spent Mother\u2019s Day planting them wherever she directed, and she had them for half a year.

Set a reminder in January, and make your mom feel special.", "NTA, as a mom, when my kids were still at home and asked what I wanted for Mother's Day I would tell \"to not have to cook all day and for everyone to get on for the day\" which led to some strange meals and at least half a day without fighting", "NTA.

None of this makes either of y\u2019all wrong, but things get really bad when you start telling someone what to do/get for another person. NTA!\n \nI do have an idea on something else you can do to add to this though. I suggest you go to the library and find a couple books she might like so she can spend the day curled up in a good book while you do the things you said.

A bunch of flowers, her choice for movie night, whatever she would like. \n\nNta for not *getting* something...its not about the purchase, its about the love.

Even that you would take the time to make something simple means a lot to most moms. Hope you have your mom have a great day!", "NTA.  My sister was a single mom of 2.

Always around the same time. Same month. You had 365 days to prepare. \n\nLook at it another way. I bet your mom has been short on funds and busy prior to your birthday more than once. I bet she probably still got you a gift. This is your time to celebrate all the selflessness she has done for you throughout the years. \n\nI am a mom. I don\u2019t expect Mother\u2019s Day gift from the kids. Acts of service would be enough. But if they always gave me a gift every year and then this year said, I\u2019m too busy/ broke to bother this year. I would be hurt. Esp if they had a job/ access to $. So it\u2019s more about the precedent (how you celebrated in the past) if you usually just did breakfast in bed, she\u2019s likely not expecting a gift. \n\nYou could also say it didn\u2019t arrive yet, do the acts of service and pampering, and then give her a gift next week.", "NTA at all!

I mean they're all made up, but I digress. Nor would I want my child to skip any studying and sitting for finals. If you have a halfway decent mom, she doesn't want you to put yourself out or give to your own detriment. Gifts are things that can be used up and thrown away.

My kiddos would bring me coffee to my room made exactly as I like it and we'd spend the day together. I'm not a big breakfast person, so coffee in bed was perfect.", "Even if money wasn\u2019t tight, my kids showering me with love and appreciation for a day? Better than any present.", "NTA", "NTA kid if there's anyone who knows that money is tight it's your mom and she will completely understand that you couldn't get her anything this year, besides, moms feel overjoyed with just the fact that you remember the date, she will really appreciate you helping her with stuff she needs", "NTA. Breakfast in bed and a couple of chores sound like a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA as a mom with a kiddo about your age, I would freaking love it if my kid cooked for me and cleaned up around the house without being asked. (I'd love it more if it happened on more than just Mother's Day...) Gifts are nice, but any effort at all is appreciated.", "NTA.\n\nI get phone calls for Mother's Days and I appreciate them. I don't want my kids spending all their money or time, running themselves ragged. I know they love and appreciate me. I don't need flowers or food to prove it.\n\nYour parents seem to be cut from a similar cloth. Do what you were planning and don't worry about your friend.", "Please make her a card tonight, with a \"certificate\" for a mother/daughter in-house spa day. \n\nLet her pick a day after your exams and get some face masks from the pharmacy, do at home Mani/pedis (if you don't have a nail kit you can buy one from the dollar store), and drink cucumber water. All a mom wants is to spend quality time with their kids.", "NTA.  I never expected a gift from my kids.  If one of them offered to clean out the refrigerator for example I would be so happy.  You are a sweet girl to do house things as a gift.", "Make her breakfast \nMake her a card / write a poem \nTell her verbally how much she means to you\nMake popcorn & Have a mom/daughter movie date w snuggly socks and blankets\nMake her a coupon book for dates in the future w things to do together\nBake her some brownies (and clean it up) \nAnd do the cleaning. That is a good one for sure! \n\n\nAlso, college classes? You\u2019re 16? Do you mean college prep? What is your extra curricular and what does keeping up with your mental health entail? Asking bc I am wondering if some of this (except for the money) is poor planning on your part given Mother\u2019s Day is every year in May, and perhaps you\u2019re being a little self absorbed. You wouldn\u2019t be doing any of those things mentioned above if you weren\u2019t born. \nJust sayin\u2019 \nAll that said, thoughtful homemade gifts are always the best. And tell your friend to support you not denigrate you. NTA but have a little growing up to continue to do. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA, ignore your friend. Doing something helpful and kind for your mom will be greatly appreciated. My kids did something similar for me one year, and it was so very appreciated at the time.", " My mom used to say all she wanted for Mother's Day was a clean house that she didn't have to clean herself. I think as long as you're taking the time to acknowledge your mom and everything she does for you, and you spend some quality time with her, she'll be happy!", "To answer your questions, My school offers some college level classes to its students I'm in two of them. I'm in my school's ROTC program which helps plan, set up, and execute school dances, sports games (mostly the parking), and sometimes fundraisers. And I see a therapist every couple of days to help me work through some issues. \n\nThough you're kind of right and I could have planned a bit better. I don't feel self absorbed but once again I could be wrong. Thank you for your comment.", "For moms, it's not about a gift or doing random chores. It's about a huge hug, and being told you're the greatest mom ever!  That's the gift your mom will cherish forever.", "NTA, and tell your well meaning friend to butt out. It's not about gifts; it's about showing love and respect. Every year I am asked what I would like for Mother's Day. Every year I say the same thing; a tidy house and a day off from doing all the household chores. And every year I am lavished with gifts which are thoughtful and I love them, but it's not what I ask for. And every year it disappoints me that my family just don't care enough to make an effort around the house.  To the point now I don't enjoy Mother's Day. \n You know your own mother. Ask her what would make her happy and deliver.", "NTA. A clean house is all I ask every year. That is a gift in and of itself", " NTA \n\n A gift isn't a necessity, anyone can go out and just buy something with a generic happy mothers' day card. I'm almost 30 and got my mom a $25 indoor plant (she prefers those over bouquets because they last a long time and she like to \"enjoy\" her gift) and I made her her favourite cookies. \n\nShe was more than happy with that and the fact we all spent time together (my little family and extended family) today, she was happy af. \n\nWhat you're doing for your mom is perfect. You didn't forget and you're still appreciating her on Mother's day.", "If you were my son and you made me breakfast in bed and cleaned around the house do mother's day, that would make my day. I would absolutely love that more than any other gift. Maybe run to the store and get a nice card, or better yet, make one. NTA at all.", "NAH sometimes money is tight. If you can\u2019t afford to do a gift then you can\u2019t. If you don\u2019t have time you don\u2019t have time to make something. \n\nBut cleaning in your own home is not a gift! Seriously - I\u2019d be so offended if someone thought helping out around their own house was a gift for me. It\u2019s right up there with buying her a package of cleaning products (unless specifically and directly requested!).\n\nFind something free/affordable to do with your mother that she\u2019d enjoy. Go for a walk. Play board games. Do a puzzle together. Watch a movie on free tv. Whatever is within budget that she\u2019d like. \n\nOh - and do the housework anyway not as a gift - but because it is needed. \n\nNow - if your family is atypical and your mother doesn\u2019t do a larger share of house work - then that\u2019d be different. But mothers overwhelming do the majority of household unpaid labour in my country - by a considerable margin - so it is a safe bet to assume that\u2019s a high possibility in your household too. (I am not a mother btw)", "That\u2019s a beautiful idea. Mom approved here. You sound lovely op.", "Nta. Not all parents like worldly things. If you want to do something nice, make her favorite treat if you can and have a movie night just you and her and watch her favorite film. Majority the time, quality time, with loved ones is always better than material possessions. \n\nI live far from my mom, so I actively try to speak to her often, more than the rest of my siblings and i know some much more about her than the rest do. Knowing her better like this has also given me the ability to know her humor well and when i can afford funny gifts i send them to her randomly through out the year since love isnt limited to just one day. You can celebrate her year round by showing you care. \nBest of luck op.\n(Also your friend sounds a bit shallow or materialistic, or comes from a wealthy family, either way stay weary of that one with sharing personal things)", "NTA - Acts of service is also showing love, not everything is about money. I\u2019m a mom, a home made card and my kids showing me how much they love me, by making me breakfast and a coffee or whatever kind thing they do for me would have me over the moon. Quality time and showing someone you love them is more important than a gift that costs money.", "For anyone needing to do something for Mother's Day, DO THINGS. Sweep. Dust. Clean the silver (we have 2 candelabras. They always look like crap). Walk the dogs. Make dinner. Empty the dishwasher. Remember to water the new grass seedlings. Pull the mulch bags out of the trunk. Bonus points: LAY THE MULCH. \n\nI can think of literally 100 things that would make me feel special. SEEN. \n\nAnd none of them are flowers, perfume or chocolate.\n\nWelllll, maybe chocolate. Fresh baked chocolate chip cookies are my nemesis. But showing that you know that, and making them?? OMG.\n\nNTA.", "Nta, most moms appreciate gifts from the heart more than ones from the store...rather it's handmade gifts or labors of love.", "Jumping on to say that a handmade card or even a note on regular paper might be something to add?", "YNA. \"Coupons\" for breakfast in bed, cleaning the house will no doubt be appreciated by your Mom. But I would advise making a homemade cards too no matter what age you are. (I happen to love them, and have actually requested them  lol)"]}
