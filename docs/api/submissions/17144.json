It's not like you're refusing to celebrate her at all. Money is just tight right now, and most moms I know would definitely appreciate having things, especially household chores and the like, done for them so they don't have to for even one day by their teenager over getting another bouquet of flowers any day.\n\nSometimes doing something tedious for someone else so they don't have to is the true gift.", "NTA, Buying gifts when money is tight is so stupid. The cold hard cash is so much more valuable and your mother should understand this. \n\nInstead do something nice for your mother, make her food or take some responsibilities off her shoulders for the day.", "NTA\n\n\nGift could be a gesture. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a thing. You are doing what you can within the time and limit you have. And your mom would hopefully appreciate that. \n\n\nIf your friend doesn\u2019t understand that someone\u2019s situation could be different than hers then too bad.", "NTA - Your plans sound nice. Acts of services is a perfectly good thing to do, and many people value them over physical gifts.\n\nSometimes money is tight and schedules are tighter. You\u2019re still putting in effort to make your mom feel special. That isn\u2019t negated because you aren\u2019t buying her a thing.", "NTA. Things happen, it's alright. Maybe make her a small card to give her in the morning, but you have a pretty good plan in place.", "NTA...", "NTA.\n\nThe day is to show your appreciation. How you do that is up to you, not everyone expects gifts.", "NTA.  A clean house is a WONDERFUL THING!!  Add in a homemade card listing what you love about your mom and she will be elated.   Trust me!", "NTA.", "NTA\nActs of service can be a beautiful gift and just as meaningful as giving a physical gift. My teen very much shows love with gift giving but also loves to do acts of service to show how much she cares. I'll be open and frank in saying that she's an amazingly thoughtful gift giver but I couldn't tell you what she got me for mother's day last year but I CAN tell you that in 2020 she had my sister take her to the grocery store where she purchased all the ingredients to make a lovely but simple dinner and then cooked me dinner and did all the post dinner clean up. Even if she'd just made pancakes and eggs out of the pantry, it would have been just as meaningful.", "YTA why\u2019d you wait till the last minute? mother\u2019s day is annual. you had a year", "Dude at least you\u2019re not ignored and told it\u2019s a different day lol idk what year it even is..month etc..due to being ripped off all, my meds", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's about thanking her for her role in your life. Although it's become commercialized, it's not about buying things. How people demonstrate their love and appreciation can vary. A treat of breakfast in bed is perfectly acceptable (make sure you clean up too \ud83d\ude09). I'm sure she'll love it!  NTA.", "NTA \n\nAs a mom, I would love the effort you're planning to put in on Mother's day. I think the point is to show your mom that you love and appreciate her, and you're doing that.", "Definitely NTA, the fact you are doing things around the house is incredibly thoughtful. You don't just have to show love through spending money.", "NTA. Sometimes the best gifts are free. You can always give her tokens to cash in like a hug or something to help around the house like cooking dinner.", "NTA \n\nBut i think you could additionally write her an heartfelt letter. It will not cost anything and it's also something that she can keep", "NTA\n\nIf you feel up to it, I know how to decorate the place when money is tight. It takes a lot of time, but if you clean up after yourself, it's a really nice gesture.\n\nGo to the nearest shop with free paint samples and grab a bunch of them in different colors. You can go with a theme but try to stick to 3 similar colors.\n\nGo home and cut them out into shapes. They can be hearts, flowers, polka dots! But this will take a lot of time, it's easier if you stack them and cut a bunch of your design all at once. Them take some tape (the cheapest kind if you don't have any at home. It'll make it easier to clean up after) and stick the designs over the walls. You can cut up samples to make confetti (only if you clean it up after!) or letters to make a message on the wall! If you can spare a dollar, go to the nearest dollar store and find some balloons and blow those up too. You want the place to feel special for her and decorations go a long way.\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA \n\nI'm a mother and let me tell you, someone taking some of the load off of me is the best present I could get. I'd rather have someone do the dishes and mop the floors than get flowers or something material. I think showing your appreciation is way better than buying something. And I bet your mom agrees. But may I suggest just making her a card or something or you could even do a little coupon book with tasks you plan on doing. Moms eat that stuff up.", "NTA I'd be happy with hugs from my teens. I love when they're thoughtful and I'd prefer that over something bought any day.", "I would love breakfast in bed and for someone else to clean!  That is a sweet and thoughtful gift.", "Dude, she's a kid with no money. Me and my sister are twice her age and literally figured out what we were getting our mom two days ago", "I don\u2019t plan for Mother\u2019s Day in advance.
