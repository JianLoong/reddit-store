Make it clear that if it's acceptable for you to watch kiddo alone while he is drinking with a friend then so can you too. It sounds like you need to start taking more time for yourself.

You fully deserve to let loose and have fun. If he can have time off, then so can you.", "Whoa, he is an ass! Why is it way to soon for you but not for him? This kinda shit pisses me off", "NTA. Even if you were obnoxious while drunk it doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything embarrassing or dangerous. Breastfeeding is hard work and you saved up for this night. I would press him to say exactly what y\u2019all won\u2019t be doing again and why.", "I'm so sorry you spent two whole weeks preparing for this event and your husband is a dick.", "You asked him to watch *his* baby?

It's so unfortunate you had a baby with this man.", "Oh helll no...\nNTA!!!!", "Nta -you have as much right to a night as he does. \nI wouldn\u2019t be really annoyed if my husband acted like that.

You husband just finally had to bear the full weight of responsibility for caring for the child, AND caring for you, which was probably a lot to throw on him all at once... but really, I think it was well deserved so you're good for it.", "NTA. \n\nIF your husband were actually a good provider for you and your child, he should have been able to manage parenting by himself for a few hours.", "NTA, he makes you watch the kid alone when he goes to hang out with friends but then gets pissy that he has to watch them a single time on a day you scheduled well in advanced and gave him plenty of time to prepare for?

As he said, you deserve that time so him actually seeing you do that should have made him happy, not irritated. Now if you being loud or whatnot disturbed the baby or something then that\u2019s something to work out going forward but you said that wasn\u2019t the case. You absolutely have nothing to be sorry for that you\u2019ve provided, and your husband is being very disrespectful with his attitude. You seem like a great mother and wife, keep being you and have a talk with hubby on expectations going forward and that you felt hurt by his attitude about this. I hope you resolve this for the future. Mothers definitely deserve selfcare, and time away from responsibilities concerning the baby. It\u2019s an exhausting time you\u2019ve been through since pregnancy after all and being a mother doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get to be an adult individual too!", "NTA. You\u2019ve just grown a human for 9 months you\u2019re allowed to let you\u2019re hair down. It is not too soon I had my first drink after 1 month of my baby being born. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It\u2019s nice you\u2019re having a drink with you\u2019re friends you need balance. He was going out himself so soon so he cannot really say much . It\u2019s not like he\u2019s \u2018babysitting\u2019 it\u2019s his baby. Similar happened to me on the weekend my boyfriends mom had our son and I ended up having a few glasses and my bf did not like it at all.", "Wonder why many guys work on making a baby, yet want nothing to do with said baby. \n\nJust don't have a kid.", "NTA. You are your own person and are allowed to have fun. Sucks that he has preconceived notions on what moms should look like when doing so, but that\u2019s on him.\n\nI would have a conversation with him to determine a little bit more about his feelings about the situation, but do not let him gaslight you into thinking your behavior was the problem.", "NTA OP! Please make this a routine ritual and preferably go out and hang out with your friends!! Let the husband take care of the baby all alone!!", "He knew I planned to drink and I even asked him before inviting her over to continue drinking and he said that was fine. I wouldn't say the details were 100% discussed but at least 75%. He knew I pumped for the occasion, knew I planned to drink, etc. The only thing that wasn't discussed with the original plan was Jody coming back to my place but again, I asked him before I asked her and he didn't act irritated at that point. He even went and grabbed us wine.", "Sounds like he has some preconceived notions of how a mother is supposed to act and when he realized that he wasn'treally okay with OP still being herselfAND a mom, he came face to face with his misogyny and foisted off on her, blaming her for his issues. \n\nNTA", "You're NTA then. What's good for the goose...\n\nI hope you had a good time and enjoyed your little break. You should show your hubby these comments.", "The part with the friend coming back to your place and you and her continuing to drink while your hubs watched the baby is of course the real issue.  \n\nWhat was the issue though?\n\n* Was it your husband felt sidelined, excluded, a 3rd wheel to you and your friend?  \n* Or was it your husband was annoyed about watching the baby?\n\nNTA, if it he was annoyed about watching the baby.  As a father of 2 with my youngest at 20, you need to really cherish those 1 on 1 times with your baby, those moments are precious and fleeting.  If he didn't, he's a dumbass and a jerk.\n\nIf it wasn't that, no one likes being excluded especially when its happening right in front of you. Even if it was \"your time to cut loose\" and your husband gets his time away from the home that you haven't, it's still kind of sucks to be excluded from something happening in front of you.  I wouldn't say that you are an ahole if that's the situation.  \n\nYou should talk with your husband to find out exactly what he was upset about.", "You didn't ask him to watch the kids next door. You asked him to spell you for an evening and manage his offspring. Lots of people don't even need to be asked. They just help out and let their partner take a breather.", "I think you replied to the wrong user.\n\nEdit: but I agree with you."]}
