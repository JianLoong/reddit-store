But this comment makes me wonder if he's not actually annoyed about watching the baby, and instead specifically about whatever you did while drunk.\n\nCould it be that he's not upset at watching the baby, but because he wasn't left to watch the baby _in peace?_ \n\n OFC you're entitled to let your hair down and let loose with your friends, but I think when he promised to give you time off to go and do what you wanted, he might have meant for you to leave the house to have fun (like he does) instead of bringing the fun back home. The baby might not have been bothered by how \"pretty fucking loud\" you were, but it sounds like your husband was. Or maybe he feels it's inappropriate to get drunk around such a young baby, regardless of who's watching it, and your behaviour made him uncomfortable. \n\nNAH, just a miscommunication of expectations to clear up for next time.", "NTA. You definitely deserve a night off. I wonder if he felt like you were drunk so you were out of commission until morning if the baby needed anything? So his few hours could potentially be a whole night solo for him. Just making a guess.", "NTA - he\u2019s being ridiculous. I would sit down with him and talk out why he is upset, and why he feels he can go out and have drinks with his friends but you\u2019re \u2018not having a repeat of that anytime soon\u2019.\nHe was happy to pay lip service to your social life but not do any actual labour towards it.", "NTA. No you're not in the wrong but he's probably feeling out of his depth and while it can feel awkward for a solo inexperienced man to handle the baby alone it is something good for both him and the baby to get used to. I don't particularly blame him though ( for the anxiety not for being a moody git) as a 4 month old baby is still very much a mother/baby bond naturally and wouldn't be left with men that often or for very long historically. I say this as an older man who did a LOT of caring of my young son whilst his mother carried on with a degree course. Many men can rise to this occasion but even though culturally it's difficult for some. Many men have not been trained in what to do and so feel out of their depth in such a situation. Of course this applies to women also. If he is a good man/father/parent then he can overcome this and thrive with it but you sound like you need to discuss this deeply and thoroughly.", "Your husband sounds like a boring, pathetic, narrow minded small dicked man if he cannot bear to see you have fun.", "NTA!! You had half a bottle of wine (of course you were feeling it because you probably haven\u2019t drank for over a year!) and you made sure your daughter was completely provided for. I would say to him that you won\u2019t be having a repeat of him speaking to you like that any time soon!", "\u201cHe\u2019s a damn good dad\u201d has gone out several times since you gave birth, tells you your time will come\u2026 but not yet\u2026 even though baby can take bottle and you\u2019ve pumped extra milk\n\nNTA but take the blinders off, your husband is being super controlling. Half a bottle of wine while hanging out with a gf at home is so tame, it\u2019s scary that he\u2019s so mad about it. Was he like this before or is this a \u201cnot how a mother should act\u201d thing?", "NTA. Here\u2019s another dad who wants a trophy for \u201cbabysitting\u201c his own child.", "YTA\n\nYou are gaslighting us by making the title about your husband watching the baby when this story has nothing to do with that and is instead about your drunken behavior.", "NTA. Hubs needs a reality check. Every time he goes out and has drinks with friends, so do you.", ">Too soon to be acting like that.. \n\nLike what? Enjoying life and blowing off steam? Hanging out with friends and reconnecting?\n\nI have a suspicion, that the husband has an idea of what \"proper behaviour\" is for moms - and getting tipsy and having loud fun isn't on the list. \n\nThis needs to be a serious talk between the two of them, because otherwise I see this going into the \"I won't ALLOW my wife to embarrass me in public like that\" after a while. And that's .. well.. not good.\n\nNTA", "This reminds me of that Spongebob episode with baby clam where Patrick is the dad and Spongebob is the mom", "NTA\n\nHe's not a good dad if he's never been with the baby before just because she's been breastfed. I really pity straight women because y'all essentially made, cook, sex doll servants no matter whether you bring an income or not because even when y'all split and half the bills y'all still end up doing most of the chores and child care. And the bar for fathers is so low where dude doesn't even have to spend time with his kid to be considered a good dad. I know a bunch of commenters are going to come in with disagreements but the data shows most couples are paying the bills together and women still do all or most of the child care and chores. The data shows coupled mothers spend 2.5 times more in child care than coupled fathers.\n\n\nI honestly hope that you have some form of allowance that allows you to save up the money because you're going to need a divorce once that child hits 18. Or see if he will allow you to go to a technical school so that you can get some certifications. And I do mean the word allow you because the fact that he's freaking out over you going out drinking for one night is telling me there's going to be some control issues here.\n\nNo amount of communication or counseling is going to fix this and instead it's likely going to give him ammunition to further hide his abuse using therapy talk. I honestly seriously suggest you reflect on your relationship and see how controlling he is, how little he actually is involved in parenting, and how much respect he has for you. Start noticing if there are double standards on what he can do versus what you can do in regards to socializing.", "i think against everyone really that this is a NAH here. I dont think he was mad about being with the bby. I think u might have gotten a lil unhinged but tbh I DID TOO MY FIRST TIME AFTER PREGNANCY. Its NORMAL. JUST THINK HOW LONG U HAD TO BEHAVE!!! He most likely got irritated because he thought you were not behaving as a new mother should but you did your homework, you prepped everything and she is chill. Tbh my first outing after goving birth i got so shitfaced i was barfing and shitting at the same time. My (now ex)husband was absolutely livid lmao and i get his point. But i think this needs to be a conversation about this since he still hangs out regularly with his bestie its not fair to be so dramatic about ONE time. Also post partum wine drinking gets u like 30 times more drunk omg. Dont feel like an idiot. But next time, try to drink lil less and example in a daytime situation to show his ass its not aleays gonna be like that. You go mama you dont need to lose ur identity because u are a mom", "Seriously. Are we to believe husband hasn\u2019t had 2-3 drinks (likely considerably more on occasion) with pals? Why is it any different for you? You get to relax, too. And no, that doesn\u2019t change \u201cnow that you\u2019re a mom\u201d just in case that BS argument comes up. Moms get to have fun while dads/others  take care of baby, just like any other human adult.", "Never said anything about dealing with the baby. You assume he is inept.  No where in this post outside the title does op suggest watching the kid was the issue.  The issue is she was sloppy drunk and loud.  Perhaps he was embarrassed because of her behavior.", "Not even sure why she had to have everything organized.  It is just as much his responsibility as hers.  But you are correct NTA!", "So if he stumbled home completely smashed and was being super loud and the op took issue, she would be the AH as well?", "This is what got me too. A parent doesn\u2019t \u201cwatch\u201d or \u201cbabysit\u201d their own children. Her husband is already of the mindset that anytime he\u2019s involved with *his* *baby*, he\u2019s actually doing his wife a favor.", "Let\u2019s say he had actually brought a friend home and was embarrassingly drunk.  Being loud and carrying on.  Op is annoyed as she\u2019s stuck being the adult in the room.  He\u2019s not an ass?", "What info given in the op led you to this conclusion?", "What in this post suggests caring for the child was the issue and not the sloppy drunks.", "It wasn't well-prepared though. OP says in a comment that there was no discussion beforehand of her inviting a friend over and continuing to drink. \n\nIt sounds more like OP's partner was annoyed that he had two drunk adults being loud while he was trying to deal with a baby, and less like he was annoyed about the childcare aspect. \n\nAt that age, it probably is too soon to invite ppl over for a nightcap on zero notice.", "It\u2019s his responsibility as much as hers to look after the baby.  Does he discuss with her that she will be looking after the baby the whole night when he goes out?", "That's the vibe I'm getting too. I don't think OP is an asshole, but her husband may have just been shocked at how drunk she got and had not expected her to be acting a fool. I personally hate being sober around a bunch of drunks. Throw a baby in the mix, and no thanks! I think OP and husband just need to have a conversation. No ones an asshole.", "Well the obvious difference is that he goes elsewhere when he drinks, whereas OP invited a friend over with no notice to continue drinking. \n\nNote that nowhere in the post does OP actually say that the husband was annoyed about watching the child.", "If you are that annoyed at your own spouse having a few drinks for the first time in over a year, especially in ways that didn't wake baby, I'd think it was time to reevaluate if I really, actually, liked my spouse or not.\n\nThe way you talk about OP here you make it sound like it's normal that her spouse might hate her, hate her actions, and not be ok with her acting *unmotherly* every once in awhile. It sounds like you have a really specific way you expect your partner to act, and I  sure hope they fully understand this before engaging with you further as a potential mate.\n\ntldr: While many of us do get annoyed at loud people in restaurants, many of us don't consider our spouses to be loud or annoying most of the time either, nor do we lash out at them in the way you have here. Most people actually like their spouse, and don't need them to leave the shared home for each of us to have a good time without directly involving the other.", "OP says in a comment that the friend coming over to their home afterwards was not discussed ahead of time. That's a pretty major shift in plans.", "In a comment, OP says that did have a plan for the friendsgiving dinner, but that inviting her friend over after and continuing to drink was something that just sort of happened.", "Can you read? She pumped enough for 8 feedings beforehand. Baby was fine and never in danger.", "The baby was in no way at risk.  The baby is being bottle fed breast milk from before she drank alcohol.", "I think you might be misinformed about the risk. The ABV of breastmilk is the same as that of your blood. If you blow a .08, your blood is 0.08% alcohol by volume. A ripe banana (something people are very comfortable feeding babies) has an ABV of 0.2%. As long as she wasn't getting completely blitzed, it's fine", "OP ensured the baby would take a bottle and pumped and stored enough to feed the baby during the time the alcohol was in her system. OP also ensured there was a sober adult (the baby\u2019s father) on duty for when she drank 2 glasses of wine. She covered all the potential risks. \n\nNTA", "She pumped before hand, she had enough bottles, the baby was at no risk", "Either you didn\u2019t read the post or you don\u2019t understand how pumping works.", "4.5 months isnt desperate?\n\n\nShe\u2019s probably not drank in over a year and you\u2019re shaming her for having one fun night?", "Me and hubby have a 3yo and the rule of atleast one sober parent when we are alone with him.

Why do you think this post warrants the post I replied to", "Ours never latched. My wife stopped pumping 4 weeks ago when our little one was 10.5 months. Up until then she was exclusively bottle fed with breast milk until the last few weeks where we tapered it off.
