The baby might not have been bothered by how \"pretty fucking loud\" you were, but it sounds like your husband was. Or maybe he feels it's inappropriate to get drunk around such a young baby, regardless of who's watching it, and your behaviour made him uncomfortable. \n\nNAH, just a miscommunication of expectations to clear up for next time.", "NTA. You definitely deserve a night off. I wonder if he felt like you were drunk so you were out of commission until morning if the baby needed anything?

No you're not in the wrong but he's probably feeling out of his depth and while it can feel awkward for a solo inexperienced man to handle the baby alone it is something good for both him and the baby to get used to. I don't particularly blame him though ( for the anxiety not for being a moody git) as a 4 month old baby is still very much a mother/baby bond naturally and wouldn't be left with men that often or for very long historically. I say this as an older man who did a LOT of caring of my young son whilst his mother carried on with a degree course. Many men can rise to this occasion but even though culturally it's difficult for some. Many men have not been trained in what to do and so feel out of their depth in such a situation. Of course this applies to women also.

Hanging out with friends and reconnecting?\n\nI have a suspicion, that the husband has an idea of what \"proper behaviour\" is for moms - and getting tipsy and having loud fun isn't on the list. \n\nThis needs to be a serious talk between the two of them, because otherwise I see this going into the \"I won't ALLOW my wife to embarrass me in public like that\" after a while.

I really pity straight women because y'all essentially made, cook, sex doll servants no matter whether you bring an income or not because even when y'all split and half the bills y'all still end up doing most of the chores and child care. And the bar for fathers is so low where dude doesn't even have to spend time with his kid to be considered a good dad. I know a bunch of commenters are going to come in with disagreements but the data shows most couples are paying the bills together and women still do all or most of the child care and chores. The data shows coupled mothers spend 2.5 times more in child care than coupled fathers.\n\n\nI honestly hope that you have some form of allowance that allows you to save up the money because you're going to need a divorce once that child hits 18. Or see if he will allow you to go to a technical school so that you can get some certifications. And I do mean the word allow you because the fact that he's freaking out over you going out drinking for one night is telling me there's going to be some control issues here.\n\nNo amount of communication or counseling is going to fix this and instead it's likely going to give him ammunition to further hide his abuse using therapy talk. I honestly seriously suggest you reflect on your relationship and see how controlling he is, how little he actually is involved in parenting, and how much respect he has for you.

Why should you care? \n\n She has been prepping for 2 weeks prior so that the baby is used to taking a bottle (it takes time for them to.go from a human nipple to a bottle) and so that she has plenty of milk in the fridge. She did not up and decided to get drunk on a whim. Even with the friend visiting, in a comment, she says she asked if it was ok. He said yes and even brought them a bottle of wine to drink.\n\nGetting shit faced in an irresponsible manner is bad. But she made sure her baby had food, could take a bottle, and has a caretaker( the babies father). And it sounds like she hasn't been able to let go with her adult friends for a year.

Many fruits and juices have the same alcohol content as what breast milk would after drinking", "Wish I could upvote this x 100. Everyone should go read cribsheet & emIl newsletters by Emily Oster who breaks down this and other commonly given advice. The \u201cno drinking while BF\u2019ing\u201d rule is not at all evidence based. The amount of alcohol in your breastmilk matches amount in your bloodstream. So if you\u2019re just over the legal limit to drive (.08 - roughly 2-3 drinks), then there\u2019s only .08% alcohol in your milk. There is no studies to suggest this would harm the baby and it defies logic to conclude it would. This part is perhaps more contentious but even having a moderate amount of alcohol with food while pregnant - which does send more alcohol to the fetus than BFing does to the baby - has not been linked to FASD\nor other adverse affects. So BF\u2019ing after a couple drinks is way safer than moderate drinking while pregnant - which I would argue is also perfectly safe. It drives me bonkers that BF\u2019ing parents have been conditioned to think we need to prepare for a night where we have a couple drinks as if it\u2019s a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.", "Agree, the amount of alcohol isn\u2019t literally zero but it may as well be.

Normally, neither of us would consider ourselves watching the kids, we both are by default unless otherwise discussed.
