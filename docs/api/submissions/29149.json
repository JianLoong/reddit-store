From the very beginning the family got weird vibes. Example: she put on my wedding ring that was in my bathroom drawer and sent a Snapchat to her story that said \u201cshe\u2019d be next\u201d. She followed my brother once 45 min away while he dropped something off to our mom because she suspected he might be cheating. She texts all of us incessantly saying she can\u2019t wait to be part of the family. For reference, my brother does not want children and she already has three from her last two marriages.\n\nThree months ago, he started trying to end things. Oldest trick in the book, she stopped taking her birth control. They had a condom break so he bought her plan B. They went on a trip, came back, he\u2019s unpacking his duffle bag a week later and finds the plan B. She states she forgot to take it. \n\nTwo weeks later, she finds out she\u2019s pregnant and texts a picture of the test to me saying \u201cit\u2019s uncle time!\u201d. For reference my wife is also pregnant and I got confused and thought she was talking about OUR pregnancy. My brother had no idea she told me and he asked her to get an abortion. She said it was too late for the pill abortion (not true - only 7 weeks along) but that she was planning on getting an abortion when she went to see her parents in a nearby town.\n\nGoes to see her parents. He logs onto his computer and see that she\u2019s bought all sorts of \u201cdad\u201d Christmas gifts for him as they share an Amazon account.\n\nHe\u2019s freaking out, of course. Decides it\u2019s all too much and ends things with her. She tells him we (my side of family) will never meet the baby if he doesn\u2019t stay with her and marry her. \n\nHe feels awful, like he\u2019s abandoning a pregnant woman. I told him she knew his wishes, ignored them for her own personal gain, lied to his face. I told him he can be there for the child without enabling all of this from her. He\u2019s happy to coparent and pay child support once baby is here but we made it clear SHE is not welcome ever. \n\nJust not sure what the right thing to do it. I\u2019m bummed in a lot of ways because this kid would be my kid\u2019s cousin and would be born the same month. If it wasn\u2019t for how off kilter she seems, I\u2019d love to have a relationship with the child as obviously this isn\u2019t the baby\u2019s fault.", "created_utc": 1697602474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ahv4c/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_abandon_his/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. Just after the first paragraph she sounds coo coo for coco puffs. I think now is the time to start separating a relationship with her/ the baby. She already has three kids; she won\u2019t be able to do it alone. He should definitely break up with her and run far far away so he can enjoy a normal life. She will always try to use the baby as a weapon against him unless he sets the boundaries now that he wants to help with the child but NOT her. If he does not want anything to do with the child, that is his right as well.", "I recommend your brother asks for a DNA test, and if the kid is his, sue for full custody. She does not sound stable enough to parent a child properly. She sounds unstable enough to allow the child to bond with Dad, them traumatise it by ripping it away and denying visitation.", "NTA, she's obviously one of those people that think that adding a baby to a deteriorating relationship will save it. He needs to get a paternity test first and foremost, so he's not paying child support if the child isn't even his. Once the results come back, if he is indeed the father, he needs to take legal action to get child support set up and always pay by check or through the state, so he has a record it was actually paid, as well as a visitation schedule. If she doesn't allow visitation, he needs to start documenting the time and date she refused visitation so that he can later sue her for custody based on not allowing him his mandated visitation.\n\nEdited for spelling.", "There\u2019s a massive difference between abandoning a pregnant ex and refusing to have to do with her and the baby and just splitting up because the relationship is no longer working \n\nHe can split up with her because he doesn\u2019t love her/doesn\u2019t see a future/feels manipulated and lied to. And still be there for the baby. \n\nIf he suspects she\u2019s going to play nasty I\u2019d suggest he keeps everything in writing (all offers of help, requests to come to scans etc) and maybe get some legal advice. \n\nBut he can\u2019t stay with someone just because she\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s not fair on anyone.", "NTA - what she's done sounds a lot like reproductive coercion and is really manipulative. I'm not sure how things would work out legally, but I think your advice is sound about being there for the child without giving in to his gf's manipulations.", "NTA she sounds unhinged. If she\u2019s really pregnant he should get a paternity test. If he\u2019s the father he can take her to court for visitation or shared custody. Honestly what are the alternatives. Is it good for the baby if your brother is ex husband number 3 ?", "This is why you don't stick it in crazy. \n\nOf course the reverse is true as well, don't allow crazy to stick it in you.", "NTA. It's all up to your brother, but if she wants child support, she will have to work custody and visitation out through the court. He doesn't have to marry her to co parent.", "She does seem sketchy, but so is everyone here. Not least your brother for \u201ctrying to break up\u201d with his girlfriend by continuing to have sex with her, I guess? ESH", "NTA. This is a complex and difficult situation. Your brother's concerns are valid, and it's clear that there are a lot of red flags in his relationship with this woman.  \nHe tried to communicate his wishes and concerns about having a child, and her actions suggest a disregard for his feelings and desires. It's not fair for her to manipulate the situation, especially by threatening to withhold access to the child unless he stays with her.", "mmmmm are we *sure* there actually is an actual baby? wouldn't be surprised if he caved and married her and oh noooo she lost the baby what a shaaaame. if it is legit though, he wouldn't be abandoning the kid just by dumping her.\n\nNTA", "your brother FAFO, literally. Now the thing is out of his hands, whether he will be the father or not is not up to him.\nWhile he should make it very clear to her that he doesn\u2019t want any long term relationships, the girl is obviously toxic, he has to prepare himself for the fact that he might well have a child.\nWhat you do with that kid as a family determines whether or not you all AH.", "So brother doesn't wants kids yet dates a woman with 3 from 2 marriages?

What a mess. This woman tried to trap your brother. Don\u2019t worry too much. With child support comes the right to visitation. Your nephew can visit.", "NTA.  That is one of the oldest tricks in the book.  In a week or two, she will start spotting and claim she had a miscarriage.  \n\nINFO: why is he with her if she has three kids already and he doesn't?  Did she lose custody of the kids?  If she did, that is a ***HUGE*** Marinara (red) flag.", "NTA.  Time to see a lawyer and get a rock solid completely clear parenting plan in place. And +1 on the paternity test recommendation.", "NTA already been said but no your brother have ever right to run away. It sucks but she literally breached his trust without taking plan B.", "NTA.  Agree with everything others are saying, separate fully, support baby emotionally and financially.  Also, just a thought.  Has she seen an actual doctor and gotten a positive test or just a pee stick at home?     \nYour family should really surround your brother with support and love and help him see that this woman is trouble and he can be a father to this child, without embroiling himself any further with her.", "He needs to have a real come to jesus talk with her, preferably at the top of the stairs", "NTA this woman is unhinged. Getting pregnant on purpose to trap someone is beyond wrong!", "NTA - but why did your brother go on a trip with her and keep sleeping with her when he wanted to end it and couldn\u2019t trust her to take birth control ?", "I\u2019d make sure he gets a paternity test first, this woman sounds unhinged.

She sounds like a bunny boiler", "NTA.. he was professionally baby trapped. It's all over now except for the shouting..", "I\u2019m with you on NTA. Honestly OOP, I\u2019m a bit concerned for your brother\u2019s safety with some of his girlfriend\u2019s behavior. It sounds really toxic and emotionally immature. I think the advice is sound but if he does want to leave, it may be a good idea to have a legal custody agreement so she doesn\u2019t weaponize his child. Your brother has my sincerest wish that he can live his best life with his child.", "I told him I think he should be there for the child financially and as a father since that is his obligation. But to get away from her. We still have 5 months to figure things out, but he needs to step away from all of this I think.", "He\u2019ll be required to pay child support. Fathers have visitation rights. He can have the baby over without any interference from her. If he doesn\u2019t want to see the baby, he\u2019ll still be required to pay.", "It is NOT his right to abandon his baby. It takes two to tango. That baby hasn't done anything wrong.", "I will say, for what it\u2019s worth, I actually really like her other three kids which is a little funny to me in the big scheme of things. I think she\u2019s a decent mom just an absolutely nuts partner. If that\u2019s possible.", "Thanks. This is helpful. He has no idea how to raise a kid but my wife and I are happy to help however we can.", "Yeah, I\u2019m trying to tell him that she\u2019s not playing by any rational rules so he needs to get a lawyer etc. thanks for this.", "I\u2019m hopeful that they can peacefully coparent if she has enough time to realize he\u2019s not going to be with her.

But yeah definitely going to advocate for paternity testing.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell him. That he can do the \u201cright thing\u201d without being with her.", "That\u2019s a really good point and puts it into words well. She knew what he wanted and she actively went against his wishes for her own selfish desires, knowing he would be unhappy.", "Yeah, the kid is welcome. The kid is not the problem. It\u2019s the mom. Tbh would actually love our kid to have a cousin close in age.", "Totally agree brother was idiot, she said she was done having kids and actually had two abortions before they met. So he just\u2026 believed her. Her kids are all teens", "OP literally said that his brother can still be there for the child without enabling her.\n\nShe is a lying, manipulative person and he owes her nothing.\n\nAre you one of these \"the man is always wrong\" people?", "Abandoning/breaking up permanently with crazy ex doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s abandoning his(?) child.", "Exactly he\u2019s the one who got into  a relationship with a single mother of 3 with 2 different fathers.

Thanks. Whole thing sucks.", "Is it really an obligation though? You seem to either want to or do have a lot of say in your brothers life...", "If, as a woman, you stop taking birth control when you know your partner doesn\u2019t want a baby- that\u2019s called reproductive coercion. It\u2019s very different than having mutual unprotected sex. She manipulated him, and no man or woman should be forced to have a baby under such conditions.", "Eh if a woman can abandon a baby at a safe haven a man should be able to abandon a baby too. Would be really sexist to suggest otherwise.", "I agree the baby did no wrong in this situation and the baby deserves two parents. I am not saying stay together or anything but Co parent there is apps out there so you don't need to communicate much only on things retaining to the baby.", "Hol up - she\u2019s got other kids???", "Your brother is ... Not a smart man.", "You're welcome. We all get a crash course in raising kids when we become parents.

The man still stuck his dick in crazy and came up a dad. Suuper surprised here", "Nah I try my best to stand up for men in general, especially on Reddit where men really get stomped on unfairly.\n\nI don't think he owes her anything, I just think that there is a third person involved that is more important than either of them and my position on the issue is in relation to that.", "Yeah it\u2019s an awful situation. I hope he can work something out.", "He can get 50/50 custody and avoid paying support.", "Yes. Parents are generally expected to take care of their own children. Most developed countries have something called child support. \n\nStupid questions get stupid answers, dude.", "Shouldn\u2019t, but at the end of the day, he might be required to pay support. My ex and I 50/50 custody, so we were each responsible for our son when he was with us. If OP\u2019s brother wants to be involved, he might be able to get joint custody.", "Yes. Lives in a one bedroom apartment", "Yeah I found myself telling son not to lick toilet seat last week. Can\u2019t wait to teach him about safe sex someday", "I don\u2019t think anyone is really questioning paternity as he spent the weekend with her (Thursday - Tuesday) in another state when she got pregnant. They know the day it happened based on her period, and she was calling/ texting him all the time even days they weren\u2019t physically together before that. So I worry that getting a paternity test would look bad if that makes sense?", ">The man chose a woman who was not mentally stable\n\nHang on, it's *his* fault she is not mentally stable?\n\n>expected her to play along when she clearly Chooses to have children over abortion.\n\nSeems like she indicated she wanted to terminate. she's been lying all along. Again, not his fault.\n\n>The man still stuck his dick in crazy and came up a dad.\n\nAnd OP has said he can support the child without dealing with the crazy woman. Are you implying or his brother are at fault here?", "Thanks mate.", "A paternity test is a must. I was angry at the time when my ex did it, but my son was set to inherit quite a bit of money. I can\u2019t say I blame them once I thought about it.", "You are NTA but hopefully this is a huge learning experience for him\u2026 so so many red flags.", "Yeah, that was a fun conversation too. I was a single mom, so showing him how to roll a condom down a banana, so it doesn't have an air pocket, was not my idea of a good time. It still had to be done, though. I'm still not sure whose face was a more brilliant crimson.\n\nI have to give you props, I never had to stop anyone from licking a toilet seat.", "I mean I agree honestly but he's going to need one for the custody stuff anyway so might as well. Normally I hate the idea how that's everyone's immediate go to and I don't think it all help their relationship at all if anything it could be a nail in a coffin."]}
