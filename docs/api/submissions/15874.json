I only wanted an immediate family dinner with just me, my mom, my dad, and my brother (M23). My family doesn\u2019t really have a good relationship with my brother because he is extremely bipolar and has a lot of other mental disorders and is also a drug/alcohol abuser. Throughout the years we have had a really bad relationship with him and he moved out because we didn\u2019t approve of his lifestyle and the way he leeched off of us. I really want our family to have a good relationship again, but just this once I\u2019d didn\u2019t want to invite his gf (F18) to this event. She comes to multiple family events but I just wanted this to be immediate family. She finds ways to make everything about herself and makes my parents miserable too. She\u2019s a high school dropout that refuses to get a job so her and my brother live in a trailer together. My only reasoning asking that she didn\u2019t come is just so I could spend time with my brother. My brother completely blew up about it and blamed my mom for influencing me to not like her, but this is completely my decision. My parents have been nothing but kind to her even though we can\u2019t stand her. My brother refused to come to my birthday dinner, and has been lashing out at my parents. Recently, my brother completely ruined his truck and begged my parents to buy him a new one and they did and he didn\u2019t even thank them. Just yesterday, he said he was not going to come to my graduation because of the relationship between my parents and his girlfriend. I was always the person that was his biggest support system and showed up to all of his soccer games and his football games and his graduation too. So AITA for being outraged at my brother not coming to my party?", "created_utc": 1682662476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131jg9n/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brothers_girlfriend_to/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope you are more outraged by your parents STILL enabling your brother/with the new truck/the SAME OLD temper tantrums they put up with/ya know brother being the ASSHOLE he is on any random day?

I wish I had some piece of amazing advice that could help you with this, but the truth is: every addict has to hit their own bottom.

But try to enjoy this time with those in your life who are supportive and are here for you. Graduation is a fun time and you should celebrate it.

It seems like your family has provide a lot for him and all you want is to spend time with him.

You are setting a boundary! \n\nYour brother seems to be blowing this out of proportion and is behaving like an addict/alcoholic. The selfishness, the gaslighting, the codependency, anger and resentment are all very common with someone suffering from substance abuse. The best way to combat this behavior is setting and keeping boundaries. \"I'd love to have you at my birthday dinner, but this time, I just want it to be our family. I love and miss you!\"\n\nKeep your boundary - but also know that it is okay if he doesn't come. That is his choice. It's hard, and it'll hurt if he doesn't come, but at least you won't be enabling his behavior.", "NTA\n\nBut, rule to the wise, if you're trying to \"extend an olive brach\", you started off absolutely terribly.", "NTA, it\u2019s always your choice who gets to come to your parties.\nYou can be upset he didn\u2019t come but you can\u2019t demand he be there.

I only wanted an immediate family dinner with just me, my mom, my dad, and my brother (M23). My family doesn\u2019t really have a good relationship with my brother because he is extremely bipolar and has a lot of other mental disorders and is also a drug/alcohol abuser.

I decided I wanted to extend the olive branch to him for my birthday because I want our family to have a good relationship again but I requested his girlfriend (F18) didn\u2019t come because I just wanted to spend time with him. She finds ways to make everything about herself and makes my parents miserable too. She\u2019s a high school dropout that refuses to get a job so her and my brother live in a trailer together. My only reasoning asking that she didn\u2019t come is just so I could spend time with my brother.

Unless I worded that wrong I just said it because I still want him to be part of the family", "Yep that\u2019s how it went by the sounds of it. And I don\u2019t like the fact OP used his bipolar to demonise him, and that she listed that as one of the reasons THEY DONT LIKE HIM. He cannot control his bipolar, and bipolar often gets worse in stressful environments (source: I am bipolar) so it\u2019s not shocking it\u2019s bad considering the way he\u2019s treated.", "Yeah I think I should ask for 1on1 with him more often, but I have invited her to multiple things. This was just the one thing I wanted immediate family but I do understand what you\u2019re trying to say.", "Why would she want to hang out with her brother's drug addicted, high school drop out gf? LMAO did you read the whole post??", "It\u2019d be kind of hard to want for include someone who sucks the life out of the party.", "Only wanting immediate family for a party where *you choose the guest list* is 100% fair\nThe fact the gf sucks is just the cherry on top", "If you wanted him to come at all, asking him to leave his partner at home was the worst possible move you could make. \n\nBefore you even have an opportunity to start and patch up anything, you start off by drawing a line, even though you were the one asking him.", "He's also done nothing to get his bipolar under control. \n\nHaving a disorder doesn't mean you get to hold the people around you hostage", "Fr, people with bipolar can thrive and do amazing with a good support system and the right combo of meds. When I was little, my dad entered a sorta psychosis and was diagnosed bipolar, and it was bad for a little bit, but the people who care about him rallied to make sure he was okay. He's been stable for the last (at least) decade. And tbh idk what \"extremely bipolar\" means lol that's not a diagnosis\nHe either is or he isn't, and he's being treated or he's not.", "Please don't listen to this person OP. You are under no obligation to spend time with anyone, especially on your birthday", "Exactly this. 100%. I know it sucks. Sorry to be harsh. I know you miss him. It's time to transition to your adult relationship with him, and let go of his mistakes. Look forward, never back.", "They are a couple, dude. The more you try to exclude one, the less you'll see of the other. At this point, he dgaf about his family. If his sister wants to see him, she's gotta realize they are a package deal.", "Also, I'm curious, how old are you? And do you have any children yourself?", "I get that totally but by the sounds of it he isn\u2019t well off and doesn\u2019t have any help he could use; this is not an excuse, but I feel as though their family could\u2019ve attempted to get him help", "This is the most asanine logic I've ever heard. \n\nSo OP is basically a hostage to her abusive, drug addicted brother? \n\nIt honestly sounds like you've never known addicts before because if you did you would be advocating for OP to stay far, far away", "What does that have to do with the tea in China? So you can claim superiority because you took a creampie from someone?", "Literally none of that matters. She's an adult who wants to have a relationship with her adult 24 year old brother. I guarantee if she keeps trying to exclude the girlfriend, her brother will have nothing to do with her.  \n\nShe said he WAS an addict and whatever, the girlfriend too and a dropout. Who cares? What about now? Sis don't know because she's stuck in the past. \n\nTo have a relationship now, she's gotta start now. Not stay stuck in the past. Also, she's 18 and he's 24. How much of this do you think was put in her mind by her also toxic parents?\n\nWake up, dude. And stop responding to me. Sounds like you need to lay off the drugs and go back to school as well.", "So you insult me because I disagree with you?\n\nI hope you're reading this, OP. This person doesn't care about you, they just want to be right", "Idgaf if you agree or not. You started with the insults, not me. Good luck. Seriously hope you don't have any kids \ud83d\ude09", "I never insulted you."]}
