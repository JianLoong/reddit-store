I only wanted an immediate family dinner with just me, my mom, my dad, and my brother (M23). My family doesn\u2019t really have a good relationship with my brother because he is extremely bipolar and has a lot of other mental disorders and is also a drug/alcohol abuser. Throughout the years we have had a really bad relationship with him and he moved out because we didn\u2019t approve of his lifestyle and the way he leeched off of us. I really want our family to have a good relationship again, but just this once I\u2019d didn\u2019t want to invite his gf (F18) to this event. She comes to multiple family events but I just wanted this to be immediate family. She finds ways to make everything about herself and makes my parents miserable too. She\u2019s a high school dropout that refuses to get a job so her and my brother live in a trailer together. My only reasoning asking that she didn\u2019t come is just so I could spend time with my brother. My brother completely blew up about it and blamed my mom for influencing me to not like her, but this is completely my decision. My parents have been nothing but kind to her even though we can\u2019t stand her. My brother refused to come to my birthday dinner, and has been lashing out at my parents. Recently, my brother completely ruined his truck and begged my parents to buy him a new one and they did and he didn\u2019t even thank them. Just yesterday, he said he was not going to come to my graduation because of the relationship between my parents and his girlfriend. I was always the person that was his biggest support system and showed up to all of his soccer games and his football games and his graduation too.

And I don\u2019t like the fact OP used his bipolar to demonise him, and that she listed that as one of the reasons THEY DONT LIKE HIM. He cannot control his bipolar, and bipolar often gets worse in stressful environments (source: I am bipolar) so it\u2019s not shocking it\u2019s bad considering the way he\u2019s treated.", "Yeah I think I should ask for 1on1 with him more often, but I have invited her to multiple things.

The more you try to exclude one, the less you'll see of the other. At this point, he dgaf about his family. If his sister wants to see him, she's gotta realize they are a package deal.", "Also, I'm curious, how old are you? And do you have any children yourself?", "I get that totally but by the sounds of it he isn\u2019t well off and doesn\u2019t have any help he could use; this is not an excuse, but I feel as though their family could\u2019ve attempted to get him help", "This is the most asanine logic I've ever heard. \n\nSo OP is basically a hostage to her abusive, drug addicted brother? \n\nIt honestly sounds like you've never known addicts before because if you did you would be advocating for OP to stay far, far away", "What does that have to do with the tea in China? So you can claim superiority because you took a creampie from someone?", "Literally none of that matters. She's an adult who wants to have a relationship with her adult 24 year old brother. I guarantee if she keeps trying to exclude the girlfriend, her brother will have nothing to do with her.  \n\nShe said he WAS an addict and whatever, the girlfriend too and a dropout. Who cares? What about now? Sis don't know because she's stuck in the past. \n\nTo have a relationship now, she's gotta start now. Not stay stuck in the past. Also, she's 18 and he's 24. How much of this do you think was put in her mind by her also toxic parents?\n\nWake up, dude. And stop responding to me. Sounds like you need to lay off the drugs and go back to school as well.", "So you insult me because I disagree with you?\n\nI hope you're reading this, OP.

It's for the best. I know you want to mend that relationship,  but until your brother is ready to work on himself,  these things will continue to happen. You should be enjoying yourself. It appears that he has been draining the family for years , don't continue on this pattern.", "Opie, I think it's time to step back and as the commenter above said, you are not obliged to hang around talk to people.

If my partner's family asked to have a meal just with her I'd be completely fine with that, and vice versa. It's not like she told her brother it's because she doesn't like the gf, she just wanted it to be her immediate family, the people she grew up with.", "[removed]", "So his YOUNGER sister is supposed to fix all that?\n\nLike respectfully because you're being respectful to me.\n\nOP had every right to decide who attended her birthday", "[removed]", "No I\u2019m not at ALL saying she was supposed to fix that, I do not think that at all. I think their parents should\u2019ve offered the support needed. \n\nI totally agree OP has a right to decide who attended the party- I don\u2019t care if his girlfriend was invited. What I AM saying though, is that I believe OP should\u2019ve reached out previously and asked for one on one time before the party. OP absolutely has a right to that, and they\u2019re not TA for not inviting her, but I think they\u2019re the AH for the way she resents her brother for his bipolar, and for the way she went about inviting his brother. \n\nThis could all be an honest mistake by OP and she didn\u2019t realise what she was saying was going to have such a big impact.", "[removed]", "That's fair. I read this differently as I've been both the little sister and the big brother in this regard. \n\nI agree that OP might not have realized that her words would carry so much weight but, again, she's the younger sibling and it sounds like her older brother has been toxic and irresponsible for a while.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Big fat nope. Im getting married and only having immediate family. I love my sisters husband and other sisters boyfriend, i like and get along well with my future inlaws partners.

I would not say that I am more important than her to him or that I should be.

I do think there comes an age and a point in relationships where it\u2019s okay that they are more important.", "INFO: how long have your brother and his girlfriend been together?? the age gap is already weird, quite a difference maturity wise between a 18 and 23 year old.", "ESH besides you.

Sounds like they\u2019ve created a monster by letting him do whatever he wants, and they pick up the pieces.", "Just wanted to pop in and say that bipolar isn\u2019t an adjective. It\u2019s a neurodivergent diagnosis. Just cause the guy has emotional problems and can be volatile doesn\u2019t make him bipolar. That said, if he has an actual diagnosis, great. I\u2019m just really tired of people using NDs as a descriptor for unhealthy or negative behaviors.", "Agree, and want to add:   OP, have you or your parents attended any Al-Anon or other support groups for people who have a loved one with a substance use disorder?", "NTA. I understand you love your brother , want to support him and you have your own very valid reasons for not like his girlfriend. Your brother is an addict plus his has serious mental issues plus his girlfriend and even your parents are enabling his behavior. He's an adult now and even with him being bipolar it's on him to take responsibility and charge of himself becoming clean and sober and wanting to get help for his mental health issues. Until he wants it there is nothing you can do to help him. Happy birthday and celebrate it with those who actually support you.", "NTA. Although I think you have to start coming around to the reality that your brother is not the same person anymore. Maybe he\u2019ll grow out of it, but it\u2019s not going to be anytime soon and I\u2019ll be honest with you, guy who go down that path usually don\u2019t come back. \n\nI\u2019d recommend starting to make peace with the idea that this is who he is now. I\u2019m not saying you have to approve of or put up with his antics.
