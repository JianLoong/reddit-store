I only wanted an immediate family dinner with just me, my mom, my dad, and my brother (M23). My family doesn\u2019t really have a good relationship with my brother because he is extremely bipolar and has a lot of other mental disorders and is also a drug/alcohol abuser. Throughout the years we have had a really bad relationship with him and he moved out because we didn\u2019t approve of his lifestyle and the way he leeched off of us. I really want our family to have a good relationship again, but just this once I\u2019d didn\u2019t want to invite his gf (F18) to this event. She comes to multiple family events but I just wanted this to be immediate family. She finds ways to make everything about herself and makes my parents miserable too. She\u2019s a high school dropout that refuses to get a job so her and my brother live in a trailer together. My only reasoning asking that she didn\u2019t come is just so I could spend time with my brother. My brother completely blew up about it and blamed my mom for influencing me to not like her, but this is completely my decision. My parents have been nothing but kind to her even though we can\u2019t stand her. My brother refused to come to my birthday dinner, and has been lashing out at my parents. Recently, my brother completely ruined his truck and begged my parents to buy him a new one and they did and he didn\u2019t even thank them. Just yesterday, he said he was not going to come to my graduation because of the relationship between my parents and his girlfriend. I was always the person that was his biggest support system and showed up to all of his soccer games and his football games and his graduation too. So AITA for being outraged at my brother not coming to my party?", "created_utc": 1682662476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131jg9n/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brothers_girlfriend_to/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love and miss you!\"\n\nKeep your boundary - but also know that it is okay if he doesn't come. That is his choice.

I only wanted an immediate family dinner with just me, my mom, my dad, and my brother (M23). My family doesn\u2019t really have a good relationship with my brother because he is extremely bipolar and has a lot of other mental disorders and is also a drug/alcohol abuser.

She finds ways to make everything about herself and makes my parents miserable too. She\u2019s a high school dropout that refuses to get a job so her and my brother live in a trailer together.

Unless I worded that wrong I just said it because I still want him to be part of the family", "Yep that\u2019s how it went by the sounds of it. And I don\u2019t like the fact OP used his bipolar to demonise him, and that she listed that as one of the reasons THEY DONT LIKE HIM. He cannot control his bipolar, and bipolar often gets worse in stressful environments (source: I am bipolar) so it\u2019s not shocking it\u2019s bad considering the way he\u2019s treated.", "Yeah I think I should ask for 1on1 with him more often, but I have invited her to multiple things. This was just the one thing I wanted immediate family but I do understand what you\u2019re trying to say.", "Why would she want to hang out with her brother's drug addicted, high school drop out gf? LMAO did you read the whole post??", "It\u2019d be kind of hard to want for include someone who sucks the life out of the party.", "Only wanting immediate family for a party where *you choose the guest list* is 100% fair\nThe fact the gf sucks is just the cherry on top", "If you wanted him to come at all, asking him to leave his partner at home was the worst possible move you could make. \n\nBefore you even have an opportunity to start and patch up anything, you start off by drawing a line, even though you were the one asking him.", "He's also done nothing to get his bipolar under control. \n\nHaving a disorder doesn't mean you get to hold the people around you hostage", "[removed]", "Please don't listen to this person OP. You are under no obligation to spend time with anyone, especially on your birthday", "Exactly this. 100%. I know it sucks. Sorry to be harsh. I know you miss him. It's time to transition to your adult relationship with him, and let go of his mistakes. Look forward, never back.", "They are a couple, dude. The more you try to exclude one, the less you'll see of the other. At this point, he dgaf about his family. If his sister wants to see him, she's gotta realize they are a package deal.", "Also, I'm curious, how old are you? And do you have any children yourself?", "I get that totally but by the sounds of it he isn\u2019t well off and doesn\u2019t have any help he could use; this is not an excuse, but I feel as though their family could\u2019ve attempted to get him help", "This is the most asanine logic I've ever heard. \n\nSo OP is basically a hostage to her abusive, drug addicted brother? \n\nIt honestly sounds like you've never known addicts before because if you did you would be advocating for OP to stay far, far away", "What does that have to do with the tea in China? So you can claim superiority because you took a creampie from someone?", "Literally none of that matters. She's an adult who wants to have a relationship with her adult 24 year old brother. I guarantee if she keeps trying to exclude the girlfriend, her brother will have nothing to do with her.  \n\nShe said he WAS an addict and whatever, the girlfriend too and a dropout. Who cares? What about now? Sis don't know because she's stuck in the past. \n\nTo have a relationship now, she's gotta start now. Not stay stuck in the past. Also, she's 18 and he's 24. How much of this do you think was put in her mind by her also toxic parents?\n\nWake up, dude. And stop responding to me. Sounds like you need to lay off the drugs and go back to school as well.", "So you insult me because I disagree with you?\n\nI hope you're reading this, OP. This person doesn't care about you, they just want to be right", "Idgaf if you agree or not. You started with the insults, not me. Good luck. Seriously hope you don't have any kids \ud83d\ude09", "I never insulted you.", "NTA. Your brother needs to get off the sauce. Sounds like he reeeeallllyyy can\u2019t handle it.", "Nta. It's for the best. I know you want to mend that relationship,  but until your brother is ready to work on himself,  these things will continue to happen. You should be enjoying yourself. It appears that he has been draining the family for years , don't continue on this pattern.", "Opie, I think it's time to step back and as the commenter above said, you are not obliged to hang around talk to people. You have all the reason to be angry at your brother but I think right now you should go low contact with him and enjoy the time you have with your family.\n\nHappy Birthday Opie, signed from *a random redditor*", "Yes, part of growing up is knowing how to clearly communicate your needs and boundaries and not making excuses for other people's shitty behavior. Seems like OP is doing just fine in that department. NTA.", "This doesn't sound like her reaching out after a long time of no contact though. The brother's gf joins other family events already. I don't think it's unreasonable at all to ask to have a meal just with immediate family for a change, especially if their bonds could use some strengthening. If my partner's family asked to have a meal just with her I'd be completely fine with that, and vice versa. It's not like she told her brother it's because she doesn't like the gf, she just wanted it to be her immediate family, the people she grew up with.", "[removed]", "So his YOUNGER sister is supposed to fix all that?\n\nLike respectfully because you're being respectful to me.\n\nOP had every right to decide who attended her birthday", "[removed]", "No I\u2019m not at ALL saying she was supposed to fix that, I do not think that at all. I think their parents should\u2019ve offered the support needed. \n\nI totally agree OP has a right to decide who attended the party- I don\u2019t care if his girlfriend was invited. What I AM saying though, is that I believe OP should\u2019ve reached out previously and asked for one on one time before the party. OP absolutely has a right to that, and they\u2019re not TA for not inviting her, but I think they\u2019re the AH for the way she resents her brother for his bipolar, and for the way she went about inviting his brother. \n\nThis could all be an honest mistake by OP and she didn\u2019t realise what she was saying was going to have such a big impact.", "[removed]", "That's fair. I read this differently as I've been both the little sister and the big brother in this regard. \n\nI agree that OP might not have realized that her words would carry so much weight but, again, she's the younger sibling and it sounds like her older brother has been toxic and irresponsible for a while.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]"]}
