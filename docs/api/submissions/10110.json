Are they going to want to rehome the first time they\u2019re bitten? Because even the nicest, most bonded foxes are going to bite at some point; it\u2019s a communication tool to them, and you cannot train it out of them. They also need speciality vets, and are not legal in most states - have they looked into any of that? Where is the closest exotic vet that is taking new patients? What kind of licensing or permits from your state do you need to house them? Do they know anything about what goes into securing an enclosure? Because let me tell you, they take the term escape artist to a whole new level; you have to dig down below ground level to have horizontal fencing or they will dig out, and you have to have the top of the enclosure either fully closed off or with inward facing curve to keep them from climbing out if it\u2019s open air. \n\nThese are just a few of the points that make owning a fox a bad idea for most people.

You are totally right to point out that foxes are being abandoned for a reason. They simply do not make good pets.\n\nI have worked with red foxes at a wildlife sanctuary, so I\u2019ve got some hands on experience with them. Your fears about the smell are well justified; fox urine is very potent and the smell is very persistent. They can be litterbox trained, but you should know that if you let your fox in the house 1) accidents are guaranteed and likely to be frequent, and 2) if you have a litterbox in your home it will smell of fox piss for a loooong time. And unless your yard is truly huge, having a fox enclosure in proximity to your house will mean that the smell travels through your windows, not to mention sticking to your clothes and skin after providing care to them. I\u2019m sure that the odor didn\u2019t bother your family during a brief visit in the outdoors, but living with it at all hours in your house is a different story. Dogs definitely have their smell, but it\u2019s just not the same.\n\nI work at a pet store now, and I see stories like this one play out with other animals all the time. Whether it be a turtle, parakeet, guinea pig, fish tank, or whatever else, I totally understand seeing a cute animal and feeling the impulse to make it a part of your life. But seeing an animal under professional care and reading about them online can\u2019t fully prepare you for the investment of time and resources that a pet requires when you bring them home. A large percentage of the animals that are sold in even a chain pet store end up abandoned, unwanted, or neglected, and all of them are more suited to pet ownership than something like a fox.\n\nIt\u2019s great that your daughter is doing the research on her own. But (speaking from experience,) I think her youth and naievet\u00e9 may be preventing her from taking a second to consider that the original owners of these foxes were almost certainly very much like her. They also saw how wonderful these animals were, they also thought they were prepared for the commitment, and they only found out how wrong they were once they had the pee stench sticking to their clothes. Does your family want to end up being the fourth fox owner who had to abandon their animal because they couldn\u2019t hack it?\n\nI sympathize with your kids, and I think it\u2019s nice of your wife to be supportive of their interest (although I do want to call out that \u201clivening up the space\u201d is a horrible reason to justify getting a pet, as if they were a piece of fancy furniture,) but it\u2019s also totally reasonable to not want an exotic canid as a pet. This is the sort of thing that the whole family needs to commit to, so if somebody isn\u2019t onboard, it\u2019s a no-go.
