You are totally right to point out that foxes are being abandoned for a reason. They simply do not make good pets.\n\nI have worked with red foxes at a wildlife sanctuary, so I\u2019ve got some hands on experience with them. Your fears about the smell are well justified; fox urine is very potent and the smell is very persistent. They can be litterbox trained, but you should know that if you let your fox in the house 1) accidents are guaranteed and likely to be frequent, and 2) if you have a litterbox in your home it will smell of fox piss for a loooong time. And unless your yard is truly huge, having a fox enclosure in proximity to your house will mean that the smell travels through your windows, not to mention sticking to your clothes and skin after providing care to them. I\u2019m sure that the odor didn\u2019t bother your family during a brief visit in the outdoors, but living with it at all hours in your house is a different story. Dogs definitely have their smell, but it\u2019s just not the same.\n\nI work at a pet store now, and I see stories like this one play out with other animals all the time. Whether it be a turtle, parakeet, guinea pig, fish tank, or whatever else, I totally understand seeing a cute animal and feeling the impulse to make it a part of your life. But seeing an animal under professional care and reading about them online can\u2019t fully prepare you for the investment of time and resources that a pet requires when you bring them home. A large percentage of the animals that are sold in even a chain pet store end up abandoned, unwanted, or neglected, and all of them are more suited to pet ownership than something like a fox.\n\nIt\u2019s great that your daughter is doing the research on her own. But (speaking from experience,) I think her youth and naievet\u00e9 may be preventing her from taking a second to consider that the original owners of these foxes were almost certainly very much like her. They also saw how wonderful these animals were, they also thought they were prepared for the commitment, and they only found out how wrong they were once they had the pee stench sticking to their clothes. Does your family want to end up being the fourth fox owner who had to abandon their animal because they couldn\u2019t hack it?\n\nI sympathize with your kids, and I think it\u2019s nice of your wife to be supportive of their interest (although I do want to call out that \u201clivening up the space\u201d is a horrible reason to justify getting a pet, as if they were a piece of fancy furniture,) but it\u2019s also totally reasonable to not want an exotic canid as a pet. This is the sort of thing that the whole family needs to commit to, so if somebody isn\u2019t onboard, it\u2019s a no-go.

And apparently, the scent gland that gives off this musky odor can't be removed. No wonder they've been surrendered. (Can you imagine a fox lying on the sofa and leaving its \"presence\" behind? Againg, that doesn't happen with dogs.) \n\nYour wife and kids are enamored with the foxes' cuteness and haven't a clue what they're signing on to.

Because they're like high on amphetamines all day long and will absolutely trash your house. Nor will they be content in a dog run or kennel. They have an extremely strong odor. If the fox comes inside, your house will absorb the musk odor. Your nose will become muted to it, but others will really notice.\n\nThere was a research project studying the domestication of while animals through human history. They were working on the gene involved in domestication, and wondered how many generations it would take to domesticate a wild species. They bought foxes from a nearby fur farm (very sad.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA wild animal can get used to one or a few people, but will usually be wary of others. Corvids, like a crow or raven, especially, can learn to become friendly to people, and ask for food. This is due to their intelligence, not actual domestication. Its instinct will be wild and free, only choosing to come into contact with people periodically.\n\nThis project did develop domesticated foxes. They like people pretty well, and behave much differently than their wild brethren. However, domestication means its ability to bond with humans, NOT calmness or suitability to be a house pet.\n\nFoxes are NOT calm, easy to care for pets. They require space, stimulation to alleviate the boredom, and species appropriate food.\n\nFoxes are beautiful, very clever, and often go crazy in the confinement of a home or kennel. They'll trash the house until they're left outside in a dog kennel, where they'll bounce off the walls and make loud noises, until after all that mental torture on the poor fox and those humans who kept it, it will be turned in to an animal sanctuary.

If these animals kill 50 people a year, by your numbers, that is actually more humans than dogs kill, despite massively less exposure and opportunity. Creating an environment that would actually be healthy for these animals is generally beyond the reach of most people, and safe (for both the human and the other animal) interaction with them requires training and self-discipline that is similarly out of the reach of most.\n\nAnimal shelters are full of domesticated animals that have nowhere to go, literally.

They're not semi-domesticated-- they're not domesticated at all.", "Go for it!", "I live in inner city London in an estate where we\u2019ve had four murders in 18 months. The one shooting left everyone \u2018did I hear shots?\u2019 but not loud loud. Stabbings are horribly quiet. At 2am when the fox noise starts especially the unholy murderous screaming during mating time, you see people\u2019s lights go on freaking out it is another murder.\n\nGenuinely the emergency line here will ask you report screaming questions to see if it is human or fox because can be so hard to tell especially when you move here first.\n\nThey come up onto my outside space and you see why they say cunning as a fox. I like the arrogance. They like to steal my meth head neighbour\u2019s garden decorations. He makes his own ragdolls like a Mormon mommy blogger but weirder. The foxes plau tag like pups and ritually sacrifice them. And you can smell the stench. They are incontinent the amount they expel that reeks. You can taste fox not just smell them.\n\nThey also love bins, digging up dead birds, dragging out the used pads in the trash all in front of the neighboirs and will sit there fronting you out angry as hell in broad daylight that you dared walk in their space. They are the cockiness arseholes with a certain charisma I like a lot.\n\nThey are as good a pet as my crafty meth head neighbour. Just come to London at 6am for the fox experience. Keeping them as pets is cruel. I routinely have to clean down the smell from them just hanging out in my outside area. The posh pandemic puppy supplies I passec yesterday sells fox poo shampoo and detergent to clean your dog and then anything the dog touched after rolling in fox shit. I was a dog walker. That smell will haunt you. Especially in summer.\n\nFoxes could bring the word miasma back into common use\u2026NTA", "Im just curious, does the fox smell rub off on your coworker? Like does he have a stench from being around the fox all the time?", "It's not even about safety (although this does matter a lot as well lol). Bringing in exotic species in a new environment can have disastrous environmental consequences. After realizing taking care of an exotic animal/reptile/insect/whatever is a LOT of work and ressources...some people just decide to release them in the wild! They can go on to become invasive species and mess up whole ecosystems. Animals becoming endangered because someone wants a cool pet can also have the same effects. Or sometime even spread diseases woops. All of this is we'll documented. Nature and animals aren't about pleasing you.", "If the last article I read is correct, they\u2019re also changing color as the domestication progresses.  No longer red or silver, they\u2019re getting splotchy and piebald.", "Thanks for sharing about the Russian experiment.  I hadn't realized that the musk had also gone away.\n\nI do remember that several generations into their experiment with foxes that some of them were piebald, which is another sign of species domestication (the piebald pattern/colors makes the animal much more visible in the wild to predators, but domesticated animals have more human protectors).", "I saw a documentary on this. In addition to all the other changes, these foxes laugh. It's incredibly charming. But they're still a ways from being good housepets. There was an interview with 1 woman who kept one in her home. She mentioned the time it urinated into her coffee.", "Can confirm this - don\u2019t have a fox, just a dog who seems to think it\u2019s a great idea to roll in fox pee while on walks. God she stinks like you wouldn\u2019t believe for AGES afterwards, I swear it even survives bathing her. It\u2019s an awful smell and I\u2019m not even getting it \u2018fresh\u2019.", "I agree.", "Ok, ok relax. It's not \"monsterous\" Demonizing people doesnt help. Getting angry doesn't help. We need more to put more work into educating people the downsides of keeping wild animals while still acknowledge the tempting \"upsides\".\n\nYes that baby animal is hurt, it is cute, and you'll probably love it quite some bit. But people have to know why that's a bad idea and, most importantly, what they must do instead. Rehabbers exist for a good reason. Yelling at anyone who even touches a wild animal hurts the cause as much as promoting grabbing them from the wild. The former just causes people to ignore animals truly in need and the latter hurts more than it helps. It's how we got that myth of birds and deer abandoning their young. \n\nLet's not swing the pendulum in the other direction.", "Not only that, but their ears are getting floppier, and they wag their tails in response to people (like dogs do). It's really interesting the phenotypic and behavioral changes that come from domestication."]}
