The difference is that skunks use their musk glands for defense. They don't stink constantly of their gland oil. Foxes use their glands to communicate within their animal group, to mark territory regularly, and they intensify the oil release whenever startled or excited.\n\nAlso, unlike skunks, you can't de-scent a fox by removing the gland because it's an important part of the foxes steroid hormone metabolism.", "They can be pets", "Wow, that's crazy.\n\nI'm surprised by the **\"anymore\"** I would think it'd be hardest to deal with when you first get the fox, but then you'd get more accustomed or noseblind to it like with any other smell.\n\nAny reason it doesn't work that way?", "Do you know it is possible to buy the smell (musk, urine, whatever causes it) so that OP could do trial by hot(smell)boxing wife and daughter for few hours?", "When I was a kid about 5 or 6 yrs old (I'm 60) the neighbor up the street had a fox \"Snoopy\" set up in a really nice indoor/outdoor kennel that I used to love to go visit, but I can STILL remember the odor!

We haven't domesticated foxes. That is a wild candid someone is calling a pet.", "I second this, definitely check that account out.

A lot of animals release it from scent glands for various purposes (mating, territory marking, predator deterrent, etc) and it is a very strong smell that will not go away easily. \n\nFor example, when a skunk sprays you, that is musk.", "A lot of canids have scent glands in their anus, including dogs, used for marking territory and identifying individuals (scent to a dog is as important as vision is to a human; it's their primary sense, like vision is for us). Most dogs don't usually express it, but sometimes a dog will, and you can take them to a vet who will... manipulate the glands to get the scent out.\n\nIt's _not_ a pleasant smell.
