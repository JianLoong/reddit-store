Stay here. Join local groups to connect more. There should be local Facebook groups to point you in a more specific direction. Also see what social services are located in your area to help with food, money, and employment too. Check out the county and local churches for help. Also here in the states there are buy nothing groups where they give away free clothing etc. join those groups and reach out. Since your 17 you might want to look into your high school and see what programs they have for employment, internships etc. Hope this helps.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wish I knew a bit more about your brothers circumstances, like if he is well off or if he truly could afford to keep your mother financially stable, but if he is, HTA for not supporting you all. Personally I would help my family in this situation, as I don\u2019t even know how much I feel the need to thank my mother for the support she has given me all my life.\n\nI wish you a good future OP\u2026", "NTA maybe you could contact health and human services and tell them your situation and ask what resources are available to you and what resources will be available to you when you turn 18. There are a lot of resources out there you just need to know what they are", "NTA but I think you need to chill on the entitlement of your brother\u2019s money and situation. You\u2019re not 18 and your mother is responsible for you. Regardless of whether or not your brother has the money and can afford to chip in, he\u2019s in no way obligated, and you\u2019re in no way entitled, to it. The good thing is that you are under 18.  I\u2019m sure there are social services, assistance, etc. that you can get access to. I think a therapist, in add to some job search help, would be a worthwhile goal. You\u2019ve obviously struggled with tense and difficult situations for most of your life and you would benefit greatly from learning healthy coping habits, GL."]}
