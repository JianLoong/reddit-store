My birthday is in October, mid October.\n\nAnyways, I have been looking at some restaurants to celebrate my birthday with my core group. Today as I was searching for a dress to wear for my birthday. I found the prettiest white dress with sunflowers tho white gave off autumn vibes. Its also very fairy/hippie like which fits my whole aura in general.\n\nI excitedly show my sister the dress- and yes, its overwhelming white because its long with peasant style puff sleeves, however, its clear that its not remotely a wedding like dress or bridal party dress. She asked me how could I wear white when she is the bride. Her wedding festivities had begun (we just got back from her bachelorette and her bridal shower is towards the end of October, after my birthday) and me wearing white is not okay. Only she can wear white. \"You're not a bride you cannot wear white\" were her words.\n\nI took it as a joke, and told her, its my birthday, I can choose to wear whichever color I wanted. She is a reddit lurker, and I told her I was going to ask reddit for their opinion.\n\nSo reddit, WIBTA if I choose to wear white to my birthday dinner? Or is my sister on the verge of becoming a bridezilla? So far things have been light hearted between us, however I do believe she would take issue with me wearing white.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I want to wear a white dress for my birthday in October- my sister is getting married in November.
