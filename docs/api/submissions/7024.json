{"id": 7024, "submission_id": "108kjlj", "title": "AITA for paying for my share of the trip with credit card points and not helping my friends pay their portion?", "selftext": "Two of my friends and I (all early to mid 20\u2019s) are going on a trip to New York in a few months. I\u2019m the only one with a high CC limit, so I offered to put the hotel and flights on my card. I recently got this card, and got a $900 bonus I can use to redeem on travel as a sign up bonus. I also get $300 in statement credit for travel. The trip is going to cost around $2100 a person. When I sent the screenshot of the trip to my friends showing them how much it would all cost, they asked why there was a discount not being deducted from their totals. I explained to them in was using my points to cover my portion, and that I still owed $1200 after that, and their amounts owed would remain the same. They both freaked out and said I\u2019m ripping them off. If I get a \u201cdiscount\u201d it should be split evenly, not just used on me. I explained again that I get these points as a reward on my card for the amount of money I spent to qualify for the welcome bonus; I earned these so they\u2019re mine to use. That pissed them off more. They thought I was calling them dumb by explaining it twice, they told me they know how cc points work and it\u2019s still unfair. I\u2019m holding my ground and they haven\u2019t sent me any money yet. They were both going to pay me $500 + whatever interest it incurs for the next four months because neither can afford to pay outright, but the first payment was supposed to be when I booked the trip and it\u2019s been over a day and I haven\u2019t heard from them at all. Now I\u2019m scared they\u2019re not going to pay me at all. They don\u2019t even know about the $300 in travel credit that will be added to my statement soon, am I wrong for keeping that from them as well? AITA for using points I earned on my own travel?\n\nEDIT: there\u2019s been a lot of confusion in the comments as to whether or not their purchase helped me get the sign up bonus. It did not. You can\u2019t use the points you would earn making a purchase on that very same purchase. I earned the points a couple months ago and haven\u2019t spent them yet. However, it did just occur to me I would be making 6k points from each of them, which equals $90 each. I\u2019m thinking maybe I should pay for an expensive dinner in NY to make up for that? Or maybe not make them pay the interest their purchases?

You created a problem that didn't need to exist.\n\nThey're AHs for wanting you to share your points with them and for making you worry that they might not pay you back.\n\nThat said, I think it's pretty dumb to plan such as expensive trip with people who can't afford it. Do you have cash available to pay off your share of the cost? Or will you be paying that down over the course of a couple of months, too?\n\nBottom line for me is you never should have agreed to put the whole trip on your credit card. If they didn't have cash or sufficiently high credit limits to cover their share of the cost, you all should have waited for them to save up enough first.
