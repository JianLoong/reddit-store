She can't grasp you're a good person who can send condolences and not have an affair. Her accusations are her insecurities for her to fix. This experience gives you insight; she created this tension.

But I have a candidate for your new ex", "NTA OP. This is a real red flag. I don\u2019t want to tell you what to do but I would suggest that you rethink whether this relationship is good for you.

This one is really not a keeper.", "NTA - you will be YTA if GF doesn't figure out what an insecure AH she is and you stay with her.\n\nWhat you did was kind and thoughtful. Sad that she can't see that.", "NTA but run. That is a major red flag, sending condolences and only sending condolences is in no way an indication for cheating.", "Honestly no, NTA, but I would also be curious why you'd reach out after so many years to someone you dated for a few months. Your gf is taking it too far though, for sure. All she had to do was ask you about it and confirm you don't have feelings for that person and move on.\n\nHas she shown a lack of confidence in your relationship in the past, specifically your commitment to it? Have you given her other reasons to think you could cheat on her?", "This should not come as a surprise after 7 years.", "NTA\n\nGod forbid you be a decent person to someone who lost a family member. Also, y'all dated in 2014 - not like it was long or recent!", "I'm going against the grain and not rendering judgement, because it seems strange for someone to go from 0 to 100 over something so trivial.\n\nINFO. Had you cheated on her or expressed wanting to cheat? You and the ex split in 2014, and it was only a 4 month relationship. Before and after, y'all were friends. You and your girlfriend were together for 7 years. So the first 4 years, you and the ex were friends. \n\nWhat happened that caused you to stop talking to her? Did you try to get back with the ex, spoke highly about the ex and said she's the one that got away, tried to cheat with the ex, or was cheating? Was the ex being disrespectful to your gf? Why doesn't she trust you? What happened in that first 3-4 years to make your ex react so strongly about her? What happened in the past 7 years that makes her need to snoop? Why did you immediately archive a message you sent? \n\nRegardless of judgement and who is wrong, the relationship is toxic.", "You were thoughtful and honest.  Your SO has issues.  her having an issue with what you did is just 1 problem and then how she's going about and punishing you for it a whole other issue. \n\nThis can't be the first time she's acted out like this.  If you look back I'm sure you'll find other examples.\n\nNTA - but you need to take a deep hard look at your relationship.  Do you want to talerate her behavior in the long run?  She doesn't think she's doing anything wrong.  I personally don't have a problem with her looking in your messages.  My problem is her attitude and how she's acting out.", "Nta but It\u2019s never worth it when contacting exes while in a relationship for any reason.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
