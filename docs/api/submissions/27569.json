She was seen as the most generous person in the neighborhood (she was not irl) for giving people things all the time. Once I became an adult, my rule is: my stuff is mine and I don't share. \n\nAs an adult, when I give gifts to people's children, the gifts are for the children. One of my former friends would force her children to donate a percentage of all money given to them on birthdays and Christmases. She would take their Christmas and birthday gifts, let them pick a couple, and donate the rest. When I found out, I stopped giving them gifts and told her I would donate to charity directly when I wanted to. Others did the same. She cut off everyone who stopped giving gifts. Her children are adults now and I give them gifts, all of which they keep. They refuse to donate, one even said that she donated enough in her childhood to last a lifetime.", "on holidays, we will have the kids pick out one of their gifts to donate\n\nNO. Complete AH move. Complete. Way to get them to resent giving. If it\u2019s so important to you to donate gifts, buy them yourselves.

Stop. Quit making your kids feel guilty for being fortunate and loved.   \n\n\n>my MIL was present and she thought it was unfair of me to make them give up presents\n\nThat\u2019s because it was.   \n\n\n>She thought that what I did was manipulative\n\nThat\u2019s because it was.   \n\n\nWay to go.

A child recently arrived at the shelter and her birthday is only two days after my kids', and I asked them if they would like to give a gift to her too. Even though I already got her something, the kids already got a ton of shit from family members and the play room is still cluttered. My kids were a little fussy at first because they always keep all of their birthday gifts, but changed their minds after I told them that some kids get no gifts at all. However, my MIL was present and she thought it was unfair of me to make them give up presents. She thought that what I did was manipulative.

You're letting your kids know their feelings are not important- you're just taking their stuff regardless, it sounds like you're telling them they're bad, selfish people if they dont allow you to strong arm their toys away from them.

This thing your ex boyfriend gave you? Why keep it? Oh I cleaned out your toys while you were away since I bought them so they\u2019re still mine.

This was especially true of the 90s' Puppy in My Pocket, Beanie Babies, and Littlest Pet Shop toys.

My mom was like \"well, you're not playing with them, so they need to be used.\" I cried as she started taking them, and she got so mad at me for acting childish that she threw some of my LPS and Puppy in My Pockets away since I \"didn't share, no one should have them.\" It was also a time when my mom hired a dumpster for spring cleaning, so when I was in school, some of my beanies got tossed. I was so mad!

To you, it's just a toy, but to a child, it's an important part of who they are at the time. And if they received them as gifts, those toys might have sentimental value to them, which adults don't seem to understand, especially when a child is young. They're only little once, let them have their toys. When they're old enough to make choices willingly on their own, they may choose to donate.

It keeps it from growing out of hand and teaches kids that they don't have to hoard their stuff to enjoy it, they can enjoy something and move on from it, and even make someone feel good by getting their old stuff! \n\nThere are studies about how having fewer toys actually encourages deeper play for toddlers and other benefits.\n\nI will say, showering a toddler with gifts is about the worst \"kind\" thing you can do short of letting them choose their own meals with no restrictions. \n\nI mean, if we as a species have a tendency to chase dopamine wherever we get it ... of course they wind up having tantrums etc when we don't provide them with the feel good chemical by buying The Thing I Saw In The Store! \n\nIt tends to make them think gifts are no big deal and also kind of takes away the fun from surprise gifts or birthdays and holidays.\n\nOutside of that, I'd just try to do what you're probably already doing: modeling respect for your possessions, setting clear verbal expectations for how she is to treat her possessions, correcting her behavior and then modeling how she should have behaved while explaining why, and setting hard limits about when she gets new stuff. \n\nOne definite suggestion if shopping can be a problem, set a limit beforehand. When you're getting ready to go into Walmart or wherever say: \"We're only getting food and supplies. There will be no toys and no candy today.\" That way, you can refer to the rule when they ask. It doesn't stop tantrums but it's seemed to help!\n\nOverall, don't replace things that are damaged by her not respecting them. If she asks, it's a no because you didn't treat the first one right, so you can't have anymore!\n\nAnother thing that might help is helping her verbally practice gratitude. Ask her to show you what her favorite toys are (may change by the day) and ask her why, what does she like about them? It gets her thinking about it, which may make them more special to her, and it allows for practicing her emotions/communication skills and vocabulary.\n\n[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/3v71iv/trying_to_teach_my_kids_to_respect_their/) a link to an older r/Parenting post on the subject that has some other ideas!", "Eh, if you'd seen some of the houses I've either cleaned as a housekeeper or worked in as a babysitter and then a nanny or tutor, you would be *shocked* at just how bad it can get with the amount of possessions that even toddlers can wind up with.\n\nGranted, I'm not saying the children *start* hoarding but rather handling possessions the wrong way can definitely lead to being susceptible to it later -- that includes both allowing them horrific amounts of toys and the other end of the spectrum where you do stuff like OP.\n\nDon't get me wrong, OP is waaaaay YTA but in general limiting the amount of toys that small children possess has been proven to be beneficial as it encourages deeper play and more appreciation for their possessions.\n\nIt's vital, though, to not only identify unused or underused toys but to also teach your children from a young age (again not in OP's way!) to identify what they do and don't use, and encourage them to self-select the items and get rid of them.\n\nIt teaches them how to let go of things they don't use, how to have empathy for those who don't have what you do, etc.\n\nOtherwise, for some families it becomes problematic way sooner than you can imagine. Especially with two sets of grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc.\n\nLike a family with a single toddler who had *two* playrooms filled to the brim with toys, toys in the child's bedroom, in the master bedroom, in all 3 bathrooms, the living room, kitchen, and the back porch as well as both mom and dad's vehicles. \n\nI think we can agree that's extreme lol \n\nI myself, in the ten years since reaching adulthood have probably unloaded enough toys to fill a 20ft [shipping container](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container) and I'm not exaggerating, nor is that including the amount of toys I donated in my high school years.\n\nAnd we were poor! \n\nUgh, but still OP is wrong AF. If they have reasons space-wise or something, then they need to go about it another way.\n\nFor God's sake, don't take their new toys. Don't force them to give away their damn birthday and Christmas presents. Teach them appropriate and fair ways of managing their possessions and how to feel good about getting rid of underused stuff.\n\nI mean, when I explained to a little girl I nannied about where her old toys would wind up when her parents donated them, she wanted to add more in case other kids might \"have more fun than me\" even though she'd initially been upset (it wasn't an OP like situation, she was five and they were baby toys)", "We only buy 3-4 in the first place because of cost", "So why not only buy them one gift in the first place, because of the cost? And then have them help you pick out a gift for the kids at the shelter?", "So you buy 2 gifts for each of your kids, stuff I'm assuming they'd like and then force them to pick 1 to give away? It would still be better to just buy 1 gift each and either take them to the store to buy a gift to donate or simply buy an extra one to donate while you buy the others. There's no point in giving someone a gift then saying \"alright now go give it to someone else\". You try to frame it like they're okay with it but it's clear that even when they aren't you don't respect that. No means no. Don't try to guilt them into doing what you want.", "Because I like to get something more personal for each of them"]}
