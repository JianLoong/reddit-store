She was seen as the most generous person in the neighborhood (she was not irl) for giving people things all the time. Once I became an adult, my rule is: my stuff is mine and I don't share. \n\nAs an adult, when I give gifts to people's children, the gifts are for the children. One of my former friends would force her children to donate a percentage of all money given to them on birthdays and Christmases. She would take their Christmas and birthday gifts, let them pick a couple, and donate the rest. When I found out, I stopped giving them gifts and told her I would donate to charity directly when I wanted to. Others did the same. She cut off everyone who stopped giving gifts. Her children are adults now and I give them gifts, all of which they keep. They refuse to donate, one even said that she donated enough in her childhood to last a lifetime.", "on holidays, we will have the kids pick out one of their gifts to donate\n\nNO. Complete AH move. Complete. Way to get them to resent giving. If it\u2019s so important to you to donate gifts, buy them yourselves. Don\u2019t take away what has been given to them.\n\n>My kids were a little fussy at first because they always keep all of their birthday gifts, but changed their minds after I told them that some kids get no gifts at all.\n\nJust. Stop. Quit making your kids feel guilty for being fortunate and loved.   \n\n\n>my MIL was present and she thought it was unfair of me to make them give up presents\n\nThat\u2019s because it was.   \n\n\n>She thought that what I did was manipulative\n\nThat\u2019s because it was.   \n\n\nWay to go.

We've always donated toys that our kids don't play with anymore to the shelter, and on holidays, we will have the kids pick out one of their gifts to donate. This has never been a problem and the kids don't really mind. A child recently arrived at the shelter and her birthday is only two days after my kids', and I asked them if they would like to give a gift to her too. Even though I already got her something, the kids already got a ton of shit from family members and the play room is still cluttered. My kids were a little fussy at first because they always keep all of their birthday gifts, but changed their minds after I told them that some kids get no gifts at all. However, my MIL was present and she thought it was unfair of me to make them give up presents. She thought that what I did was manipulative. AITA for making them give up presents?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As soon as her kids would open presents, she\u2019d go put them in the car while all us other cousins sat playing with ours. It pissed my Nanny off so much she started opening their presents and putting them in gift bags and making them come sit beside her to open and to play with their presents. I remember it made my cousins so happy and my aunt was furious.", "YTA", "YTA - why do you even bother asking? You're letting your kids know their feelings are not important- you're just taking their stuff regardless, it sounds like you're telling them they're bad, selfish people if they dont allow you to strong arm their toys away from them. I can't imagine being 5 years old and being forced by my parent to give up a new toy for some stranger. Being generous is taught by example, all you're doing is bullying a pair of small kids.", "YTA\n\nI hope all those kids you gave your kids\u2019 stuff to all these years know where the good homes are. \n\nBecause your two are gonna stick you in Shady Pines.", "Honestly this just sounds like straight control. The kids will probably hate holidays now because they get saddened by the idea of seeing presents but knowing much of them is gonna be taken away by mommy, who doesn\u2019t care how much her kids cry or how happy her kid was to get something before taking it out of their hands. \n\nAnd I bet this is gonna turn into - well, you\u2019re being a brat so you don\u2019t get to keep this. This thing your ex boyfriend gave you? Why keep it? Oh I cleaned out your toys while you were away since I bought them so they\u2019re still mine. Because having the heartlessness to take something a child has already SEEN and you deciding you want to take it back is just cruel. \n\nYou obviously didn\u2019t consider your kids in this decision and you want to get a high off of being the \u2018savior of the poor\u2019. Otherwise you would have bought something independently without trying to take from your kids.\n\nAnd as others say, this is the age where sentimentality is important. For me my momentos are the only way I remember the good parts of my childhood. If your kids don\u2019t want to give up more, don\u2019t make them unless you want no future with them. \n\nYTA. \n\nI hope you never do this again and that you get therapy.", "YTA. This will actually make your children see donation to the less fortunate as a horrible thing versus a caring thing. And the whole post reeks of virtue signaling.", "YTA. Y\u2019know joan crawford had her children do the same thing. This is not a compliment.", "YTA- It\u2019s one thing to take them to the store and let them pick out a toy or two to gift to these kids. And it\u2019s another to do what you\u2019re doing, and guilting them into doing it isn\u2019t going to make them more charitable. They will remember this, and your family will probably just stop giving them gifts all together now that they know what you do with them. Your kids might stop asking for gifts all together because they know it\u2019ll be given away to someone else.", "YTA. Not only to your kids but to the people who give your kids presents. They were purchased for your children. If you want to give gifts away give your own.", "I am in my mid 50s and am STILL salty about my father selling my child size A&W root beer mug at a garage sale.

We also donate old toys and our daughter knows that donated gifts go to children less fortunate. But to push your kids to give away their brand new birthday present toys is too far. You guilted your kids into giving away something that was just gifted to them. If you keep this up your kids will learn that your priority is the children you donate to vs your own kids. Like yes, keep donating old toys, but pushing them all the time especially with new toys isn't great in the long run", "YTA\n\nDonating toys that are unused is cool. But why purposely buy your child a gift that want then turn around and make them give it away??? Why not just buy one less gift for your children and instead buy a gift to donate??? I\u2019m not sure why you are doing this weird thing with your kids. All that will happen is in the future they will refuse to donate or hide things. Doing good for others does not always equal personal sacrifice. If you have the means to do it, then do it. Your children shouldn\u2019t feel bad or pressured into giving. They also shouldn\u2019t be taught donating or doing good is a painful experience.", "YTA. If you want to donate, go buy some toys you arent giving to your kids.", "YTA. Jesus Christ. All you\u2019re doing is teaching your kids that their stuff isn\u2019t theirs, and they will resent you more and more as they get older, and less inclined to be charitable.

Donating to this less fortunate is a wonderfully kind and thoughtful thing but it seems like that is your focus and not your children. They were fussy until you said some children don\u2019t get anything - that is manipulative and you are showing them that their wants are going to come second.

Forcing it just causes resentment.", "YTA.\n\u201cConvincing\u201d your kids IS manipulation. If you want to teach them how to be good people, give them less presents, and show them how to be grateful with getting less. It feels like you are giving them toys just to take them away. It\u2019s pretty messed up. I\u2019m guessing you also manipulate- I mean \u201cconvince\u201d them to chose certain toys to give away. You are truly manipulating their emotions- and I\u2019m sure at the same time, you are telling them whatever emotions they are REALLY feeling are bad or wrong. You are setting them up to keep their thoughts and feelings secret from you, because they know you will judge and shun them. \nGood luck. You still have time to fix this since they are only 5.
