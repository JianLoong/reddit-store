So for context my partner (26m) and I (25f) have been together for 5 years. \n\nYesterday my partner and our two kids ages 2.5 and 1, were staying round my parents house as my parents and my aunt, who is 76, were getting back from (separate) holidays on the same day. My aunt got back about midday as she left her car at my parents while she was away, and we were due to pick my parents up at 9pm. \n\nShe went to leave around 3ish to go home, but as we were leaving the house, she fell down the steps and smashed her face on the concrete drive, and was obviously very injured. \n\nWe called an ambulance, checked she was okay etc etc. I ended up going with her in the ambulance to hospital and staying with her til about midnight until we were discharged. My partner had to watch our kids by himself all this time (which ordinarily he would be fine to do). But his issue with me going and leaving him, was that \u2018someone else could have gone with her\u2019. \n\nI have three sisters, 24, 18, and 15. \n\n24 was picking up my parents from the airport at 9:20, so couldn\u2019t go with her. \n\n18 has a phobia of blood, and whilst is technically an adult, I think we all know that 18 year olds are not exactly the most experienced adults. He claims she should have gone in my place.\n\n15 obviously couldn\u2019t go. \n\nHe claims I had a choice in the matter, and could have got someone else to go. As it was my \u2018choice\u2019 to stay out so late, he has stayed in bed all morning and I have been up since 6am with the kids, despite having an extremely late night. \n\nAfter trying to wake him up a couple of times to no avail, i slammed the door and told him to set his own alarm. He is now taking offence to the fact that I did this and will not speak to me. AITA?\n\nEDIT for info: \n\nI told him to set his own alarm as I had been upstairs 4-5 times to attempt to wake him. He said he would get up in another 45 minutes, and it wasn\u2019t fair on my 1 year old, who cries if he sees me leave the room - if I can sneak out he\u2019s okay, or if he wakes up and someone else is there he tends to be okay - aside from a few exceptional incidents with teething. He also had a track record with refusing to get out of bed a up until a year ago when he had an NDE and then things got better.", "created_utc": 1667204309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi4pwc/aita_for_slamming_the_door_and_telling_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
