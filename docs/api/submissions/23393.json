{"id": 23393, "submission_id": "15cirmz", "title": "AITA for refusing to give up my room for a family with a kid?", "selftext": "I (19M) am interning away from home so I rented a room in a house, living with the mom and her 9yo kid (bad env to be in, can elaborate if anyone wants). When I got there, someone who was supposed to be living in the bigger next door room canceled, so I was given the bigger room for no extra charge. She also said that if the guy came later, he\u2019d get the smaller room. \n\nI\u2019m leaving in < a week and this morning at 8, when I was sleeping, she knocked, woke me up, and said we need to talk. She said another fam w/ a 7yo kid who paid for the big room decided to come early, and that she\u2019d like me to move all my stuff to the smaller room. I said no, not really bc it\u2019s smaller, but bc it\u2019s such a hassle to move everything (esp since I\u2019m leaving so soon), them coming early wasn\u2019t my problem, and she said I wouldn\u2019t have to move when I moved in. EDIT: forgot to mention that she then offered to help me move, but I still refused, which really pissed her off.\n\nNow she\u2019s upset bc \u201cI\u2019m not grateful\u201d for the free upgrade.

She's asking you to move twice in the space of a week.  That's silly.  The family can stay in the small room till you move out.", "NTA. That's nuts that you would have to move rooms for a single week because the new family arrived earlier than expected. Simply refuse to move your things and wait the week out. Shit happens in informal living situations like this.", "She expects you to be grateful for the \"free upgrade\" that lasted less than a week and would cause you to have to move in twice? Yeah right.\n\nShe literally told you up front that you wouldn't have to move. Why is it okay for her to go back on that, but not for her to tell the people who showed up early \"no\"? NTA", "NTA. You had an agreement for the larger room for a set period of time.", "That's a ridiculous request for her to make. She can just wait out the week. NTA", "That's why I always say no good deed goes unpunished. She should've kept to the original agreement and gave OP the smaller room. At least now she knows never to make that mistake again.", "INFO: Did you sign any kind of lease or contract stating which room you would be renting?", "NTA", "NTA", "I feel like her saying that was probs just to be nice since my parents were there, but still lol", "I get that, but it\u2019s just that I really don\u2019t want to move again. I wouldn\u2019t even want to move to a bigger room at this point", "The contract wasn\u2019t that detailed, so no. But we verbally agreed on the smaller room before coming.", "Yeah well, she could have said a lot of other things to be nice, but she said this. Now she should respect the deal she made.", "Okay, in that case NTA."]}
