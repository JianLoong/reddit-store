Like, if you are interested in me romantically/sexually then let me know early on so we can either develop a relationship OR I can tell you early on that I am not interested. I hate it when someone is only pretending to be friends with me for the purpose of down the line asking me out/trying to get into my pants. Someone like that is never an actual friend because he is not interested in friendship.\n\nThen the age difference is really inappropriate, so that's just gross on top of his 'orbiting' behaviour.\n\nListen to some music you like or an audiobook or whatever to take your mind off of him. And just never hang out with this guy ever again. He doesn't need to walk you to the bus stop. Also make sure that if he has a key to your apartment that you get it back, and that if your brother has a key to your place that he either gives it back or stores it somewhere A can't get to it. Find other arrangements for when you need your cat fed in your absence. Don't rely on A for this. He's made his intentions clear and you are rightly not interested.

Now I\u2019m of the mindset that brain development doesn\u2019t finish until 25 on average so you shouldn\u2019t be an adult until then. But most countries disagree. If you can join the military, vote, and such\u2026you are an adult.", "What did I miss?  He has expressed a romantic interest in her.  How did that suddenly make her a \"sex object\"?", "Where in the post did it say dick pics?", "I know what the legal definition is. Thanks ma'am", "You missed the photos he sent to go with the message.", "Well, first, the age difference is not good. You don't pursue 18 year olds in your thirties, especially not when it sounds like they had a polite, neighborly conversations and didn't actually know each other at all. I've had guys hit on me when I'm just being polite and friendly in a place where it's normal to be polite and friendly (work, service people at my apartment) and it always makes me -along with many other women - feel uncomfortable and objectified. Because I should be able to be a happy, friendly, polite person without being viewed as \"available sexual partner.\"  This is worsened by the fact that they're neighbors, so she can't avoid him. \n\n\n\n(Let me be clear: if I'm at a bar chatting to a stranger or a different social outing where flirting is on the menu, I don't care at all as long as the dude is polite and respectful, even if I'm being friendly and not actually flirting. Though I don't view men decades older than me as \"polite and respectful\" when they hit on me.)\n\n\nSecond, while it sounds like he was polite to her, he didn't actually know her, nor does it sound like they had any real friendship. See: polite and respectful, above, in a context where most people would be polite and respectful because they want good neighborly relationships. It doesn't sound like they connected over anything, or ended up in long conversations, or tried to progress from casual acquaintances to friends. So what is he basing this song lyric feelings on? I'm going to bet money not her actual personality. Every time I've had a man hit on me like this, it's always been when they have a completely false view of my personality...because I meet them in circumstances where I am polite, friendly, and stick to work-appropriate small talk. \n\n\nIn contrast, I once had a guy very respectfully ask me out after I went on a feminist rant at a book club. I didn't spark enough with him for a second date, but to this day, I hope he ended up with someone wonderful. He was polite, he was respectful, and he waited until he saw something interesting in me to ask me out, but didn't try to sneak a plausible deniability friendship in first.\n\n\nThird, he didn't politely ask her out in a way that let her have space. Like \"hey I'm about to go on vacation for a month/you're about to head home. I do really like you and wanted to see if you wanted to get coffee but if not, that's okay too\" and then if she says no they have a long time before they have to interact again. (Although again, would not recommend given the age difference.) He just sent her a meme that was way more intense than their polite, neighborly interactions. \n\n\nSo...yes, it's not explicitly stated, but honestly, what do you think he was attracted to in a young, 18 yr old girl who is interacting with him in a polite, friendly, neighborly way? I've got $100 that says \"because she's always nice to me and she's pretty.\" Not \"she's polite to everyone and that's important to me,\" or \"she's good in social situations and that is attractive to me\" but \"she's nice to me and pretty.\" without ever even considering that she's just being polite and friendly to a neighbor.", "\u2018I wake and see a text from him along with two of those pictures you only see once\u2019. 4th paragraph first sentence.

THIS implies \"sex object\" to you?", "That's a lot of words to admit that nothing he did indicated that he saw her as a sex object.", ">One picture, **the important one,** was lyrics to a song that talked about a \u201chow sweet your eyes are\u201d and how the singer wanted to spend his life with this girl. \n\nSeriously?

It wouldn't make much sense that he sent a dick pic and she says nothing about it.", "Yes. Because as a woman believe it or not a lot of women will gloss over that part because it\u2019s so violating.   And those lyrics are the song ok thinking off, then she\u2019s right to feel weirded out and read it as a threat. Making it the more important one in regards to her own personal safety. \n\nShe never did say what the second picture was but I\u2019d bet good money it was a dick pick. Just to ram the point home exactly what his intentions were. Maybe I am wrong but her wording is unfortunately all to familiar to me.", "Thank you!  These people are acting as though the woman is a total moron.  \"He sent me dick pics and I just don't what to think about it!\"  is a ridiculous thing to assume that this woman is saying.", "As a woman, I fully expect an 18yo woman to know that sending dick pics is NOT someone \"hitting on you\".    Nothing that she says indicated that she felt threatened, just grossed out that a much older man who she thought saw her as a sister, was actually romantically interested in her.\n\nObviously, you're right and this is a woman who received dick pics and yet she doesn't \"know what to believe\".   I'm sure most young woman are as stupid as you want to believe that she is.

She also saw this person as \u201csafe\u201d and thought that he saw her as a little sister. Realising that he sees her as a viable sex/dating option is throwing her through the loop and she is clearly upset about him not being as \u201csafe\u201d as the thought, again this might tie into a previous bad experience that she is still dealing with and the two are coming together in a big melting pot. I don\u2019t think this is a crazy reaction though, just a whole lot of tangled emotions coming out that she needs to unpack. Hopefully she has someone she can talk to about this and get some help processing new and old feelings.", ">.
