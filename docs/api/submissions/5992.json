I'm sure OP cooked  dinner, organized it, hosted it and paid for everything? If that not is this the time and place? \n\nI believe it was self centered and OP was looking for a fight. I care less what homphobic relatives think but for every one else who takes the time out of their day had endure this pettiness. Not only dealing with the homphobes but a little brat stiring up trouble for fun and recording it with the intention of embarrassing his family members. \n\nThis doesn't sound like a fun Christmas dinner and if I was the one the spent time and money getting dinner ready I would be pissed off.\n\nAm I saying OP should allow family members to make homohobic comments, no. But their a difference between not allowing comments and bullying and trying to start a fight.", "NTA.\nIf they avoid sharing their views in social settings then I see no point to what you did. If you have a problem with them it would be more mature to just not celebrate them.", "christmas is *exactly* the time.", "If they are hiding it, from **where**?\n\nFor there to be any info at all, regardless of how many hands you want to pretend it may have passed through, someone wasn't hiding something.\n\nAre you being deliberately obtuse?", "I\u2019m just asking OP to clarify what\u2019s meant by \u201ccloseted\u201d and \u201csecret.\u201d For instance , do the relatives pretend to be LGBTQ+-supporting in some venues but then trash talk the community elsewhere, or did they once express opposing views to OP\u2019s dad and then never brought it up again?\n\nIn other words, do OP\u2019s relatives behave offensively, or does OP just find them offensive on principle?", "Ah, yes , my favourit source of scientific information- \"trust me bro\"\n\nI don't know any definition of anomaly used in science that would apply to something just because it is small percentage.\n\nAnd I said it is silly to think that all people are meant to be in heterosexual relationship. Maybe try reading and replying to what is actualy written, instead of pushing your agenda.", "Exactly, that\u2019s what my friend said \u2014\u2018trust me, bro\u2019\u2014till I asked him to come up with a number based on some decent statistics. \n\nNow, do you want me to keep record of everything I read for you? No chance. \n\nWant a definition of anomaly, take whichever you want from any decent dictionary. Don\u2019t play silly with trying to deform words. \n\nIt\u2019s not an agenda \u2014 it\u2019s reality. Nowhere I\u2019m saying or will ever say it\u2019s right or wrong but it is beyond uncommon and thus not intended it that way."]}
