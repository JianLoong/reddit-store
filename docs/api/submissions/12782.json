If not, it sounds like maybe they didn't actually give it to you and if you put a home on it, possibly the subject of legal dispute.

If he's on an ankle monitor, then it is illegal for him to be anywhere near children.  Remind your family, if police find him near children, that he will go back to jail and anyone enabling him may also face criminal charges. Ask how they would feel if he hurt one of the kids because they keep enabling him. Is the property in your name?

Therefore, you set the rules. While I am generally of the opinion that having a criminal history does not make a person indefinitely inclined to criminal behaviors, my past work with criminal defendants has made me feel uniquely when it comes to certain crimes against children. The risk of recidivism is high and \u201crehabilitation\u201d isn\u2019t often successful in the ordinary usage of the word. You have the right and responsibility to ensure a healthy and safe environment with the children who live on the property. Your uncle has other options to visit the cousin without the cousin coming to the property.", "NTA - the mother of the convicted criminal wants her son to have access to your home where your grandchildren live and vist.  Your mother has surrendered to emotional blackmail by her sister, the mother of the criminal.\n\nYour aunt is probably saying he was falsely convicted and her sister doesn't have the heart to say 'He wasn't'.  In fairness to your aunt, people like him, if they are excluded from society, they are more likely to reoffend.\n\nObviously your primary concern MUST be your children and grandchildren.  Even if you ban him from the proerty, your aunt and uncle, even your mother might let him on, hoping that he wouldn't touch your grandchildren.  Obviously if his own children arn't safe from him - no child is.  What would this man do , if he reoffended and didn't want to be re-convicted?\n\nYour mother isn't putting your grandchildren first and you must tell her that you will not transfer the property back.  You built a home on it and it is yours.  Be sure the children are instructed to identify this man and avoid him.  Even saying they can't play outside because your uncle , aunt and mother cannot be trusted.", "NTA. Your uncles can meet him off your property. And if your parents insist, remind them that they're literally siding with a convicted child abuser over their own son, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.", "Do you live in a state with Castle doctrine? if so, I would apply it next time you see him.", "I'm not religious but I pray to god they don't find out that he's being allowed around not only more kids but around at all. He should be shunned, no one should talk to him. He's done unspeakable thing to children and they're just what? Forgetting about it? Brushing it under the rug? Disgusting behavior honestly.", "Agreed, stick to your guns and keep that criminal out of sight because nobody wants to play 'hide and seek' with a registered offender.", "Good point. If the home does not legally belong to OP, she might just need to move to avoid him being around her family. Protect the children above all else!!"]}
