Do not compromise one bit and just drink some water or sparkling apple cider or something else nonalcoholic. Your drinking or not has absolutely nothing to do with her wedding or any of them. I could understand if this was the exact opposite situation, like if a bride was asking a particularly messy drunk of a person not to drink at her wedding, but demanding you drink is absolutely insane, especially since you are trying to get your life together.
