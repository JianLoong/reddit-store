I\u2019m giving them back to you in case that person realizes the mistake.\u201d I don\u2019t know what slating means, but from context I guess she\u2019s talking about you and spreading drama.

Maybe they weren\u2019t broken but she realised yours was a good brand (GHD; Cloud 9) and replaced it with a cheaper version?", "NTA but this situation is strange and it doesnt sit well with me.", "NTA\n\nokay but what If she accidently broke straightener 1 and cause she was embarresed bought a new one and thought you just wont notice.\n\nBut cause she dosnt wanna tell the truth about breaking your property for whatever reason shes doing that drama.\n\nWhy else would you lie about something so stupid?", "Methinks the lady doth protest too much. NTA.", "I honestly think she broke yours and instead of just fessing up she figured you wouldn\u2019t notice and when you did she decided to gaslight you instead of being honest. It could be bc of a fear of confrontation or simply bc in her head she replaced it so what\u2019s the big deal.", "My straighteners were grey with black plates, quite plain. They had a lock system on the top of the hinge\n\nThe ones she gave back are black with beige plates and a weird swirly design on top. The lock is also at the bottom of the hinge.\n\nSame brand. Completely product...", "Probably old ones that belonged to SIL or her kid. They weren't working properly so she asked OP to borrow hers. She liked them so she gave OP the old ones and kept OP's.", "She's also dragging the whole family into it rather than talk to me. And I think that's where I'm most upset. I couldn't give a monkeys about the straighteners, hence why I said I'd buy new ones. It's the way she's conducted herself that's left me feeling... unwelcome?", "Thank you Internet stranger. You've summed it up very well!", "That's a possibility, but I'd rather she just said. I'd be more understanding\n\nThey're probably of equal value when both new, but mine were rather old so I can't compare", "Husband knows. Husband was with me when I said they weren't my straighteners.\n\nHusband doesn't want to be involved because it's nothing to do with him, per se. It's between me and his sister and she's dragged him into it...", "That would work if the only people getting ready at my in laws house aren't also the people my sil is getting involved in this unnecessary drama \ud83e\udd23", "But then why replace them with another pair? I mean, if they got destroyed or damaged, I'd rather she told me that than say I'm accusing her of something when I haven't lmao", "If she had someone else's straighteners, why borrow mine? Which is the very valid point everyone has made and I completely understand, but yeah I get what you mean", "Woah woah woah!\n\nLove?\n\nI want to drop it, but obviously it's just happened in the last few days and knocked me off kilter. Especially as its involved half my inlaw family \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I was happy enough to just get new ones and move on with my life!", "For clarity. New ones meaning straighteners, not in laws!", "They were only remington, so were the ones she gave to me", "The 18yo has extremely short hair. A crew cut basically", "Honestly I'd rather the truth, and no drama. Yeah I'd have been upset but they can be replaced easily enough!", "That's really weird. There's no way she thought you wouldn't realise and expected to get away with it. I'd look for ulterior motives and be on my guard around her, this woman will probably cause more problems for you down the line.", "The ones she gave back do work. My husband switched them on last night. They're still available on amazon. My old ones aren't. They're about 6 years old, maybe older? But they were reliable and worked well for my hair", "Shes dragged the family in it to victim blame. She hoped you wouldn't say anything about the switch.", "Anything that concerns his side of the family concerns him. Your husband should defend you from bad behaviour from his family, if he doesn't he isn't a good prospect for you.", "Oh okay, then your sister just wants to embarrass herself.", "I've always found that an aggressive reaction to a calm question is _usually_ a smoking gun for someone feeling guilty.", "She was hoping you'd just accept them. It's likely she liked yours better and decided to switch them. Cue making you feel so uncomfortable you won't go to her house and find your straightner there. Also people do strange things that others just can not comprehend, but the fact that she's accusing you of saying she stole them, when you clearly said and implied no such thing, is a red flag and points to that being the case (that she did steal them.)", "She wanted your hair straighteners because they did a good job and switched for the return.", "Maybe she also borrowed someone else\u2019s? Or someone left theirs at her house at some previous point?", "Well, I said love because........what's she going to say when your MIL tells her \"NeedaVent said she's forgotten the entire thing and loves you!\"  Will the SIL say  \"Well I don't love her!\"  Then she's look like an ass.    I'm sort of the nice woman who if I have to be mean does it in the sweetest way possible so the other person looks like a jerk.   Oh that makes me sound bad.  LOL", "Oh I know!  I meant hair straighteners too.  lol  Yeah don't trade in the inlaws yet LOL", "Weird. Dunno.", "so def not the daughter. This is the weirdest thing lol. Well rest assured, you have done nothing wrong and maybe her guilt is showing through and that's why she wont drop it?", "trust me some people are.. idk special?\n\nsometimes they will never tell the truth even when cought.", "Honestly this woman is usually lovely. I've never had a problem with her before. But she also brags about how she doesn't speak to this person, or that person, she uses her mother as a messenger for 2 of her kids. She always slates people and gossips about them and thats a worry\n\nBeen married 8 days and already got some inlaw drama \ud83e\udd23", "To me it feels like she broke them, didn't want to own up (maybe she's too embarrassed) and tried to replace them without you noticing. Since the original model wasn't available anymore, however, she had to buy the newer one and is now trying to pretend those are the ones you lent her. Could be entirely different, but that's what my gut feeling says.", "He does defend me when needed but this is between me and his sister. We're both adults and she should be talking to me, not his mother, his neice and him! It's regarding my property that I lent to her. We've both said that she shouldn't have gotten him involved and it's childish that she's done so and she's trying to cause issues between he and I.", "Yeah I can't say that to my husband. He's been put in such an awkward position. His sister, or his wife", "Maybe, I don't know. I've sent a message to her saying I'm not accusing her, but would have rather she'd spoken to me instead of getting half the family involved", "I like your style!!", "Honestly most of my in laws are just wonderful!", "Exactly! Which is why I said I'd order new ones. Partly to keep whatever peace there is and partly so I don't use someone else's stuff without their permission", "This is the only thing that makes sense. It completely explains why she's doing a drama fest now.", "See, you are feeding the drama llama. She LIKES that you are chasing after her. Just drop the rope.", "That's wonderful.  I only have one daughter in law & I adore her but I have 8 sons in law who I adore too.  I call them all my bonus gifts.  My kids are gifts and they're bonus gifts.    \n\n\nThey're probably all use to her ways & just blow her off.  I wouldn't stress over it anymore.   Now I'm nosy though.....have you had the wedding or is it coming up?", "That's the plan now. Just one message and that's it.", "It happened last week! Was an amazing day! I even gave the same SIL a pair of vans trainers that were too big for me and she was happy for those!", "Perfect. Hold your head up high, because you aren\u2019t the one causing drama. I wish you the best.", "Oh wonderful!  Happy Happy Marriage.   We have our 45 anniversary this month.  I'm getting rather excited.  My kids are planning something and usually I'm the planner so hopefully it doesn't involve mountain climbing or skydiving again.  lol", "Thank you so much!", "Oooh! I hope we get to 45 years! I hope you have the best day, whatever they plan for you!"]}
