In this case I agree with her.  Why should you tip someone who didn't provide any serivce?  It is the businesses responsibility to bay a decent wage, they set their prices.\n\nYOU are free to spend YOUR money however you like, if you want to put it in a tip jar, go for it.\n\nIN any of the other situations you defined, I'd be right with you, for tipping at a place where you order from the counter, I'd disagree.\n\nINFO: do you tip at McDonalds, or other fast food places?  If so, why not?", "NTA\n\nWhile it's true she did pay for the meal, you discreetly left a tip in the jar, albeit an extremely large tip. \n\nThe part where you could be the asshole here (but you're not) is where you kind of rubbed it in your Mom's face. You made your feelings known that you thought she should tip. You could have left it at that. In fact, you probably should have. Instead, you decided to share with her the fact that you decided to tip instead. \n\nAlso, just so you're aware of the way tips work: By Federal Law, restaurants have the right to pay their employees less than minimum wage, due to them \"making up the difference\" in tips. (It sucks that they get away with that, but it is what it is. Also, not every state pays their restaurant employees less than minimum wage. Check the laws in your area)\n\nHowever, if an employee does NOT make at least minimum wage, after tips, the restaurant is required by law to make up the difference, ensuring the employee makes at least minimum wage. \n\nSo, tip if you feel it is the right thing to do based on the service you received, but not out of some societal obligation to ensure employees \"make enough to live off of.\" Ensuring that isn't your job, it's their employer's. Your job is to pay for the service you receive. A tip is for service above the norm. \n\nIn this case, you placed your order at a counter, paid, and the food was brought to you. Question: Were they otherwise attentive to your needs? Did someone stop by every so often, asking if there was anything you needed, refilling your drinks, etc? Or were you, as I assume were, simply left alone to eat your meal?\n\nAlso, ask yourself this: Would you tip the person behind the counter at Subway, or McDonald's, etc, who basically do the same as this particular restaurant?\n\nI'm all for tipping at restaurants, but only when it is warranted, not out of some \"societal obligation\", pushed by the restaurant industry because they want to save some money. \n\nAs an example, my wife and I went to a nice steak restaurant the other night. The waitress there made sure we never really had to \"ask\" for anything. She would see our drinks were getting low, come over and ask if we would like some more. She made sure our table wasn't cluttered with empty dishes, etc. I tipped her $40 on a $120 tab. She was that amazing! Now, had she done the bare minimum, she wouldn't have gotten a fraction of that. \n\nMy point is, while your Mom is absolutely in the wrong for not really tipping at all, ever, you shouldn't feel guilted into tipping, either. Tipping is a way of showing your appreciation for what the wait staff has done FOR you, not to pay their bills. Trust me, if people don't tip waitstaff when appropriate (which is a crappy thing to do, to be fair. Note I said \"when appropriate\"), their employers are required to ensure they make at least minimum wage. All you are doing by dropping a ten spot on a $40 meal is ensuring the restaurant doesn't have to pay them more.", "NTA for tipping behind her back, because anyone can tip whatever they want for any reason they want. \n\nBut YTA for complaining to her about how little she tips, because anyone can tip whatever they want for any reason they want.", "NTA:  But I want to say. Maybe if everyone who complains about people who don't tip, complain that restaurants are underpaying their staff maybe we could get some changes in the laws. \n\nI see post tik tok videos and news articles about this.  Why not blame the people who's making the money and have them pay their employees", "YTA - You're imposing your belief system on her when she gave a clearly stated rationale for why she does not tip.\n\nTipping is generally for a service rendered and in most states is to offset a reduced wage (tipped wage). Counter service restaurants do not provide a service and are not paying tipped wage. On top of that, you have not even received your order when you are rendering payment at a counter service restaurant, so you are being asked to tip before you can even ascertain the quality of your food. \n\nNow on the other hand, you are well within your rights to tip to compensate on your own behalf, the fact that you knew you had to do that behind her back indicates that you knew it was wrong to do so without her consent.\n\nAnd it is quite telling that you close with a comment that differentiates one counter service venue form another, meaning that even in your own mind, some counter service folks deserve it while others would not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
