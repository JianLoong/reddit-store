She sent me a message saying that the buses were cancelled and asked if she could sleep over at her friends place and promised her friends parent would drop her back home as early as they could. I immediately said no as i do not know this friend or parent. She got upset with me and we started arguing on the phone. \n\nShe said that it will be that one time and i wasn\u2019t hearing it i wanted her to find home her way home. She argued that i never really let her go out during her school days which is true as i never understood why she wanted to go out with her friends on a monthly basis, i wanted her to focus on her education. \n\nShe shocked me and ended up staying at her friends place and came back the next day. I got home during my break soon after called her and her older sister (20) and stared shouting at her asking why she disobeyed me and stayed in a home that was not hers when she had her own home with her family. She then said back that i never let her live her life and go out with her friends and during school whenever she asked i always said no with no reason. I told my 20 year old that i wanted to hurt her when i see her i was so angry with her that my anger would\u2019ve got the best of me in this situation. \n\nI told her she\u2019s not allowed to leave the house until she goes back to college and she\u2019s not allowed to go back to the nursery she volunteered at i could no longer trust her. After that incident she stayed in the guest room and did not come out unless necessary. She hardly ate, showered, and spoke to anyone in the house. I again was upset at this as i don\u2019t know why she kept to herself in the guest room. We also hardly spoke. I asked her to apologise to me for what she did and she said she had nothing to apologise for. We spoke a few times when she asked me for money for a game she wanted to play on her phone and that was it. \n\nAITA for this?", "created_utc": 1694690499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ifrw9/aita_for_grounding_my_daughter/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Luckily, I did listen to her because today I have a good relationship with her, and she feels free to talk about things with me.\n\nLet's get a few things straight.  You can't control a person let alone a teenager.  You can guide them give advice and be supportive but ultimately, they are more likely to listen to their friends than you and teenagers are crafty as hell. You think you are clever they will outsmart you because they simply have more time thinking about how to do it than you. I suspect it's almost like how a prisoner will think about escaping. You will always be one step behind because they simply have more time thinking about how to screw you. Moral of the story? Don't even try. You are just going to lose and end up tired.\n\nIn the end our children will take their own paths and it's up to them how they want to do it. You have very little control. The only thing you can do is try to minimize the damage. That is about all you can do.

Your daughter's grown up, you should think about growing up too.", "YTA \nAnd would be a bigger asshole if this wasn\u2019t fake", "you ground your 18 year old daughter about something like a sleep over? bold move soon to be mrs. NC. she is a fucking adult, treat her like one\n\nmassiv YTA", "YTA, she is an adult, she can do whatever the fuck she wants.", "The kid is 18... it's time to cut those apron strings. yta. If I were your daughter, I'd go no contact after college.", "she is 19. she is an adult. you way overreacted and didn't even help her find a way to get home? the safer option is staying out. YTA.", "YTA Whether you like it or not, she's a legal adult. Keeping her in your home against her will is literally no longer legal. You sound incredibly controlling and if you don't change your behaviour she will likely resent you and keep you out of her life as soon as she gets the chance.", "YTA. This is how kids go no-contact once they have the means to move out. Socializing is a vital part of life.", "INFO: If it was so important for her to be home why exactly didn\u2019t you go pick her up?", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter had no way to get back home. Would you rather she walked miles in the dark at night alone or what? If you don't pick her up, she had no choice.\n\nAlso, the fact that you never let your daughter enjoy herself because she had to focus on school? It's high time some parents understand that kids need time off to relax and have fun. My parents didn't understand it either and pressured me to work day and night. I ended up with a burn-out at 15. Relaxing and having fun are indispensable to a good work ethic and motivation.\n\nLastly, as a parent you should learn to control your emotions. Screaming at your 18-year-old because she \"disobeyed\" you? If you wanted to protect her, don't chase her away like that. No wonder she stayed elsewhere, away from the screaming and the authoritariansm. Getting so mad you want to hurt your daughter? That's not mature nor good parenting at all. I'd get away from you too.\n\nI strongly advise you to reconsider how you treat your kids. They may not put up with it forever.", "YTA. She is 18 for flip sake. She is an adult. She can do what she wants.", "YTA\n\nEasiest solution would have been to call the parents you don\u2019t know, have a nice chat and thank them for letting your kid stay over. (I\u2019ve met some great parents doing that, BTW.)\n\nTBH you are a potential danger (emotionally and physically) to your family. Please get professional help or you will have no relationship with your kids very soon.", "YTA. To begin with, your daughter is an adult. A legal adult. She does not, actually, need your permission. The only reason you get her asking is because you're controlling. You treat her like a prisoner so that's exactly how she's behaving. For real, get a grip.", ">I told my 20 year old that i wanted to hurt her when i see her i was so angry with her that my anger would\u2019ve got the best of me in this situation. \n\n>After that incident she stayed in the guest room and did not come out unless necessary. She hardly ate, showered, and spoke to anyone in the house. I again was upset at this as i don\u2019t know why she kept to herself in the guest room.\n\nI suppose that your daughter had the good sense to keep herself safe and away from her demented mother is incomprehensible to you.\n\nYour best bet - call 911 and check yourself into a rehab home for mental patients. You are a danger to yourself and those around you.\n\n\nYTA actually you are beyond it.", "YTA  Time for daughter to get away from you and go NC!", "YTA your 18 year old is correct, it sounds like she never got to live her life. You force them to stay home and apologize for something out of their control. You then are acting like when you talked about your kid not really eating, you act like you don\u2019t care, you only care that\u2019s she\u2019s in the guest room. You don\u2019t allow them to hang out with friends. That\u2019s really bad.", "YTA AND MAJORLY \n\nYou grounded your daughter that is 18 yo because there was no buses to come back home ?????\n\nEven if there were, she should be able to stay at her friends house if she want to as she IS 18 YO\n\nShe can make her own decisions, and honestly you depriving her the ability to go out and stay with friends will just make her resent you and resent your house / home.\n\nIt will begin to feel like a prison to her, and she will look for a way to escape it. And once she does, everything you deprived her of she will do but 10x more, because she didn't get to do them before and she will feel like she has to recoup the time lost.\n\nLet her live and make her own decisions and have her own experiences. You are too controlling.", "She's an adult. She has rights. You can't control her like that. Don't be surprised if she doesn't go back home.", "Let me get this straight.  Your daughter is about to go off to college, where you will have no ability to monitor her behavior, and you think the best thing to do right now is treat her like a child(she is legally an adult) and give her no opportunities to incrementally take on more responsibility for her own well being.\n\nYeah, this is bad.  There are troves of upperclassman looking for angry, repressed freshmen wanting to rebel.  \n\nYou have basically set her up for failure while guaranteeing that she will go lc/nc with you as soon as she can.  Was that your goal?", "YTA. She's 18.", "YTA parents like you are the reason nursing homes full up. Plus I saw your other post where you disabled the comments and to me and the title of the post makes you know that YTA. Hope once your daughter leaves she never calls you again.", "what in the name of god is wrong with you", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted her home so badly,  why didn't you go get her? If you live in am city and don't own a car, did you expect her to walk home?", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s an ADULT ffs! You don\u2019t \u201clet\u201d her go out even once a month, you treat her like she\u2019s 6 years old, you ground her for something completely out of her control and you take away any kind of freedom she has - only abusive and controlling parents act like you do. \n\nBased off of this post, it\u2019s obvious to me that you have been isolating your daughter for her entire life which is abuse.\n\nShe\u2019s going to cut you out of her life as soon as she\u2019s living on her own and you only have yourself to blame for this. \n\nSince she\u2019s an adult - she does NOT have to introduce you to every single one of her friends, you do not have a right to demand to meet her friends parents, she doesn\u2019t need your permission to go out, you are not allowed to tell her that she \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d work or volunteer.", "I think everyone has already told you that YTA.\n\n\nNow I'll tell you what happen after because I was raised in a home like this, with this all rules.\n\nI understand that you want all of the best for her (education, discipline, safety etc.). But you're just trying to control her. And like it or not you cannot control smb who is an adult. You have to let her go and make her own mistakes. You have to build a relationship with her so she can trust you and call you in any case. She will be in trouble (grounded or not) and you want to know when it happens.\n\nI didn't trust my parents and I got myself in every dangerous situation they could imagined. They didn't know. They didn't help me. I was treated like a prisoner or a robot they could control (just like your doughter). I didn't trust them so only because I was lucky I didn't get kidnapped, raped or killed. I was poisoned and random people on the street helped me. I was more scared of telling my parents than to face this situations.\n\nOne day she'll be in a very dangerous situation and she won't call you bacaise she won't trust you. Focus more on a relationship now. It's to late to treat her like a toddler.", "Wow! When was the last time you made/seen your daughter smile? Laugh? Run up to hug you? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s been a while as by the sounds of it you\u2019ve essentially kept her imprisoned for the entire summer! \nAll because she stayed at a friends when she was 18! \nYou\u2019re not giving her discipline! You\u2019re giving her depression, anxiety, social separation, and genuinely ruining her life, why?\nWhere\u2019s your friends? I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re few and far between given your vile attitude towards your own adult daughters! \nSeriously lady, go to the west wing and release your daughter, tell her you\u2019re a dick, you love her, take her to McDonald\u2019s and drop her off at her friends house, let her enjoy herself instead of spending her fun times with her friends worrying what you\u2019re gonna fire at her for asking something every other kid in the world asks hundreds of times on a daily basis! \nGet a life and stop ruining hers, and as she\u2019s 18 I\u2019d start showing her some love and respect soon coz if I was her I\u2019d fuck college off, jump on a plane, get the fuck away from you and live my best life. \nSort it out while you still can", "\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t my child talk to me anymore.

All you\u2019re gonna do is push her away and she\u2019s never gonna come home from college again and then you\u2019re going to be on here wondering how come your daughter has absolutely no contact with you. Did you ever think maybe you could\u2019ve asked to talk to the parent and make sure that she was in an OK place. And how the hell did you expect to get home with the buses were canceled?

It took my years of therapy in my thirties to set proper boundaries.\n\nBefore people start saying I could have moved out - I grew up in a country where you didn't finish high school until you were 19, and no one worked as a teen (no such culture, strong laws against hiring minors), so I was stuck with my parents (my dad was even worse, he got angry all the time on top of being controlling). I moved to another country when I was 27 and it didn't stop them from acting like they owned me.  \n\n\nEdit: YTA. A big one.
