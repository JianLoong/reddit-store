I\u2019ve tried everything including surgery. I would be in and out of hospital if not for these 2 products specifically. Also try castor oil packs.

It\u2019s hard enough having your body fail you and you feel guilty enough. You don\u2019t need anyone else making you feel that way! \nAs far as the question AITA? No, you\u2019re absolutely not. Your feelings are valid, and I would be heartbroken if my husband asked me that. \nYou need to have a serious discussion about your relationship and how you both feel. \nYou both need to take steps in making it better. \nHe needs to be more understanding. He does not sound very understanding or empathetic. \nYou cannot help having endometriosis! You do however have to look into what you can do to hopefully better your health. I know it\u2019s hard due to the possibility of flaring and I don\u2019t know your financial situation but just try and take baby steps in seeing what you can do for yourself to be able to enjoy sex again. Sex can have a big impact on a relationship. It is a deal breaker for some ppl. \nSex with endo is possible though! \nIt might not be the same as before but you just need to be willing to learn together, trust and he needs to be more understanding! Work on it together. If you can\u2019t see each others pov in this situation and than it\u2019s not going to work. Idk what else to say tbh other than im sorry! Dealing with Endometriosis and everything that comes with it is hard enough. It\u2019s even harder when the ppl around you don\u2019t have enough empathy or understanding for you going through it. Endo is isolating enough, you need supportive ppl around you. I\u2019m speaking from experience. Not having understanding empathic family has shattered me a few times.

I think if you oppose his solution and you guys don't find another solution, be prepared for him to stick around only until the kids are old enough and then initiate a divorce and/or for him to cheat behind your back (whether that's with paid people or random people). You may not understand his sexual needs/drive or appreciate how important it is to him, but plenty people have a strong need for sex and if they can't have that within their relationship, it will be at their detriment and I can understand they will look for it elsewhere.
