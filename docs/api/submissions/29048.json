I agreed to watch a friend\u2019s 3 children, 7F, 8M, 11M, for 2 weeks while parent were out of the country. They had originally been planning for family to watch them but that feel through shortly before they were set to leave and I agreed to watch the kids so they did not have to cancel their plans. \n\nIn general the experience was good - their kids played great with our kids, and even though we had to take them to school (they don\u2019t go to the same school our kids do) - overall it went well. Then on the last day, their return flight was delayed, and instead of returning at 2:30 p.m. they ended up returning at 10:30 p.m. The original plan (before the delay) was for them to come get the kids at our house when they returned, so we suggested that we stick to the same plan. But, they then asked us to change the plan and bring the kids to their house. \n\nI pushed back, as I go to bed early and have to get up early and did not want to stay at their house potentially very late and then be tired at work the whole next day. I said they could come get their kids at our house whenever they got back in town, even if in the middle of the night, or we would be happy to drive them over in the morning by 8 a.m.\n\nMy friend wrote back and said she really wanted to see her kids and really wanted them at her house when she came home since she missed them so much while she was gone. But, she said she was exhausted and could not be bothered to drive the additional 30 min to our house to get them and said she and her husband would be fine if we dropped the kids off at 8 and left them since they have a home security system. I told her multiple times I would not feel comfortable leaving young kids at home alone at night like that with the uncertainty of travel, and finally told her I was shocked she was OK with this. Security systems are great but by the time something is going horribly wrong they are not a replacement for an adult. Plus it was storming that night and 7F is afraid of thunder. \n\nIn the end my SO agreed to stay at the house with the kids until they got back, which ended up being about 11 p.m. Nothing bad happened to the kids. However, my friend is now not speaking to me. I can see how she may feel I negatively judged her parenting (which is true, although I get that she was exhausted from the delay and maybe not thinking clearly) or that I was overriding her express wishes and I should have deferred to her even though it violated a boundary for me.

If she had chosen to leave her kids at her house unattended on any other day, and you questioned her about it, that would be different. What you did is refuse to willingly participate in leaving her kids unattended, as you have every right to do.

Wow, what a GEM of a friend. NTA", "You're NTA. The children were in your care, you were responsible for their safety. Leaving three children alone for hours, the oldest being 11 is absolutely inappropriate, in fact, it's abusive of the parents to try to put such a burden on their son! Security systems won't stop the house from burning down, won't save a child who fell on the stairs,  won't stop the child who found the loaded pistol, the liquor cabinet, the rat poison...\n\nYou made the correct decision, and if you had complied with parents' directive and a tragedy resulted, they'd have been the first to blame you.\n\nWhen I was babysitting, the standard for a satisfactory evening was: the house is still standing, undamaged and the children all alive. You did a great job.", "Nta yaaaaaa I wouldn\u2019t trust the friends parenting decisions if they told me to leave the kids.", "Holy hell, no. Where I live Kids are supposed to be more Independent than American kids and I often think some parents are overprotective. My 8y/o and 6 y/o cam stay at home for a 1-2h, but...at night? Without a certain time of arrival? While parents likely aren't available by Phone? With missing their parents, so Chances of going Outside and looking for them? No. Hell no. \nAnd - you are right. Calling Out parenting is a No Go, but you forget the one exception: Abuse. Neglect is abuse. 3h alone for a 7y/o at night is neglect.", "NTA.  A dozen things could have gone wrong on both ends. A fire at the house, a power outage, the kids acting up, the plane being delayed again, being turned back or diverted.\n\n This woman wasn't thinking AT ALL. She owes you a great apology and a debt of gratitude.", "I probably have a very different view as a latchkey child who was told pretty much as early as I can remember that I was mature for my age (and have even been told that as late as my 30s).\n\nBut 11/12 is around the age where I was left home alone for hours after school; when my sister went to a friend's house. And 8pm is late enough that you could probably have put the kids to bed and left them.\n\nBeing considerate to the 7f's fear of storms and not leaving kids on their own laudable. An 11 y/o might be fine alone, but not as fine with two younger siblings to look after; plus knowing your parent(s) are coming home will keep some kids wired well past their bedtime.\n\nNTA.

And bonus is, you won't have to ever offer to take care of their children again!", "Hold on, what did I just read?!\n\nYou stepped in at the last minutes to watch a FRIENDS 3 children for 2 weeks. Had to care, feed, take care of them and bring them to a different school for 2 weeks.\n\nFriends flight is delayed and you need to them drop the kids over later in the day or still drive and drop them so they can wait at the home until parents get home.\n\nFriend sounds really selfish and I get being tired, but either come pick up your kids or wait for the next day!!!!!\n\nYou came in and saved the trip and she is now not talking to you.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.

And then she has the gall to \"choosy beggar\" you with these very unreasonable requests at the end?\n\nHer parenting judgment is ridiculous, btw. Leaving kids that age home alone for an unspecified period, at night, is extremely irresponsible and you were right to refuse.\n\nIf she's not speaking to you, count it as addition by subtraction and move on.", "Did she even pay you for watching them?\n\nThe entitlement some parents have boggles the mind.", "[removed]", "NTA. When toxic people owe you an apology they rather avoid you then to admit they were wrong. That is the reason why your friend ghosts you.", "NTA.

You kept three kids for two weeks on short notice (I\u2019m guessing for free) and she\u2019s *inconvenienced* to come pick them up? What an ungrateful jerk. NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s not speaking to you after you babysat her 3 children for two weeks? The audacity of people. Good riddance.", "As a mother myself - NTA", "NTA. Your suggestions were perfectly reasonable, she was being difficult because she wanted to be lazy. She\u2019s probably embarrassed.", "NTA. You were worried about the kids' safety. That was an act of compassion on your part, not \"villainry\".", "You watched her kids for two damn weeks and now she isn't speaking to you over this? You need to let the other moms know how ungrateful she is so she gets no more huge favors. NTA.", "Your friend sounds selfish. After you spent two weeks looking after her kids she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to drive 30 minutes??? I would have a serious rethink about this friendship. NTA.", "If it had just been the 11yo by themself? Yeah, you would be. By that age I was babysitting other people\u2019s kids. I could manage a night on my own. But, **3** kids? And, one of them is afraid of storms? Nah. The 11yo didn\u2019t need, or deserve, that level of responsibility dumped on them.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour friend could have either picked them up, or waited until the next day. If she wanted her *kids* to remember it, she\u2019d have picked them up. I can recall a couple of times when I was younger that my parents were delayed and I went to bed disappointed that they weren\u2019t going to get back, only to be awakened much later because they gotten in and, knowing it was past my bedtime, they came to get me, anyway. I\u2019d have been fine if they hadn\u2019t, but the fact that they did made an impression.\n\nI never once doubted their love for me. That became even more important after my mom died shortly after I turned 14. \n\nYou\u2019re fine. Your friend is the one who needs to rethink things.\n\nEdited to fix tenses.", "NTA, she would have been in an airplane. She couldn't have done anything in case of emergency. Who knows whether they would have even had wifi on the plane. In the worst case she wouldn't be able to even use the security system.

Run of the mill stuff I\u2019m sure they\u2019re fine with, and could probably handle being on their own for the span of, say, dinner. But this was much later than that, and for longer, with a lot more variables than parents being a few miles away at a restaurant.
