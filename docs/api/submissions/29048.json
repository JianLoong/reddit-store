I agreed to watch a friend\u2019s 3 children, 7F, 8M, 11M, for 2 weeks while parent were out of the country. They had originally been planning for family to watch them but that feel through shortly before they were set to leave and I agreed to watch the kids so they did not have to cancel their plans. \n\nIn general the experience was good - their kids played great with our kids, and even though we had to take them to school (they don\u2019t go to the same school our kids do) - overall it went well. Then on the last day, their return flight was delayed, and instead of returning at 2:30 p.m. they ended up returning at 10:30 p.m. The original plan (before the delay) was for them to come get the kids at our house when they returned, so we suggested that we stick to the same plan. But, they then asked us to change the plan and bring the kids to their house. \n\nI pushed back, as I go to bed early and have to get up early and did not want to stay at their house potentially very late and then be tired at work the whole next day. I said they could come get their kids at our house whenever they got back in town, even if in the middle of the night, or we would be happy to drive them over in the morning by 8 a.m.\n\nMy friend wrote back and said she really wanted to see her kids and really wanted them at her house when she came home since she missed them so much while she was gone. But, she said she was exhausted and could not be bothered to drive the additional 30 min to our house to get them and said she and her husband would be fine if we dropped the kids off at 8 and left them since they have a home security system. I told her multiple times I would not feel comfortable leaving young kids at home alone at night like that with the uncertainty of travel, and finally told her I was shocked she was OK with this. Security systems are great but by the time something is going horribly wrong they are not a replacement for an adult. Plus it was storming that night and 7F is afraid of thunder. \n\nIn the end my SO agreed to stay at the house with the kids until they got back, which ended up being about 11 p.m. Nothing bad happened to the kids. However, my friend is now not speaking to me. I can see how she may feel I negatively judged her parenting (which is true, although I get that she was exhausted from the delay and maybe not thinking clearly) or that I was overriding her express wishes and I should have deferred to her even though it violated a boundary for me.

If she had chosen to leave her kids at her house unattended on any other day, and you questioned her about it, that would be different. What you did is refuse to willingly participate in leaving her kids unattended, as you have every right to do.
