I agreed to watch a friend\u2019s 3 children, 7F, 8M, 11M, for 2 weeks while parent were out of the country. They had originally been planning for family to watch them but that feel through shortly before they were set to leave and I agreed to watch the kids so they did not have to cancel their plans. \n\nIn general the experience was good - their kids played great with our kids, and even though we had to take them to school (they don\u2019t go to the same school our kids do) - overall it went well. Then on the last day, their return flight was delayed, and instead of returning at 2:30 p.m. they ended up returning at 10:30 p.m. The original plan (before the delay) was for them to come get the kids at our house when they returned, so we suggested that we stick to the same plan. But, they then asked us to change the plan and bring the kids to their house. \n\nI pushed back, as I go to bed early and have to get up early and did not want to stay at their house potentially very late and then be tired at work the whole next day. I said they could come get their kids at our house whenever they got back in town, even if in the middle of the night, or we would be happy to drive them over in the morning by 8 a.m.\n\nMy friend wrote back and said she really wanted to see her kids and really wanted them at her house when she came home since she missed them so much while she was gone. But, she said she was exhausted and could not be bothered to drive the additional 30 min to our house to get them and said she and her husband would be fine if we dropped the kids off at 8 and left them since they have a home security system. I told her multiple times I would not feel comfortable leaving young kids at home alone at night like that with the uncertainty of travel, and finally told her I was shocked she was OK with this. Security systems are great but by the time something is going horribly wrong they are not a replacement for an adult. Plus it was storming that night and 7F is afraid of thunder. \n\nIn the end my SO agreed to stay at the house with the kids until they got back, which ended up being about 11 p.m. Nothing bad happened to the kids. However, my friend is now not speaking to me. I can see how she may feel I negatively judged her parenting (which is true, although I get that she was exhausted from the delay and maybe not thinking clearly) or that I was overriding her express wishes and I should have deferred to her even though it violated a boundary for me.

Leaving three children alone for hours, the oldest being 11 is absolutely inappropriate, in fact, it's abusive of the parents to try to put such a burden on their son!

I\u2019d have been fine if they hadn\u2019t, but the fact that they did made an impression.\n\nI never once doubted their love for me.

But that didn't matter to your 'friend'.\n\nYou were responsibly not willing to leave 3 pre-teen kids alone in a house for HOURS (and possibly overnight, given the travel delays that had already happened). You care enough about the welfare of her children to know there was a storm that night (another reason that unexpected delays could continue) and know that it would frighten one of her children. But that didn't matter to your friend.\n\nYeah, this lady REALLY loves her kids to pieces. /s\n\nYour friend wanted to see her kids right away but couldn't be bothered to drive to your house to get them. (Again, she REALLY 'loves' those kids. /s)\n\nSHE's too tired, but who cares if you doing the running back and forth that she wanted you to do made YOU tired? Eh, that didn't matter to your 'friend'.\n\nIn the end, she got everything she wanted. Your SO sacrificed their time and convenience for her time and convenience (on top of two full weeks of sacrifice for her). And she thinks she has something to be offended/aggrieved by???\n\nThis lady won't speak to you until the next thing she wants from you. Take the win; enjoy the silence from her and let her drift out of your life. At the very least, stop considering her a friend.

They were your responsibility until you handed them off to their parents. You gave options but she didn't like any of them, too damn bad for her. She was out of line. Come get your kids or live with what's offered. Too easy.", "I really think you and your husband should have stood your ground here.\n\nNTA.

Why? Odds are good you know your own kid a heck of a lot better than a kid you are watching for someone else, so you have more information to judge how they will handle things, for one. For two - they aren\u2019t your kids! It\u2019s not at all uncommon to be more cautious with something you \u2018borrow\u2019 from someone else than with something that is yours, this is not that different from that.

That night, after they were in bed, I\u2019m tidying up the kitchen and I notice the longest (30cm), sharpest knife is missing from the block. \nI ripped the house apart looking for it only to find it in the knife holder/sharpener (for a much smaller knife) with bits of ham stuck to it!
