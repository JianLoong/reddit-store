I agree  the mother of the child should have some input about her family and their involvement but you answered the door and discovered a drunken irate woman who tried to physically bully themself into your home and people are ragging on you?  I, for one, am proud of you.  Good Dad trophy", "NTA you deserve to be treated with respect, especially in your home. Beth can bring the child for visits if you both agree it is safe physically and emotionally. Her family sounds like a lot.", "Some extra background points that have lead to where we are:\n- Beth's mum got married to her step dad the same weekend as my dad's 50th birthday, we decided that Beth would take my son to the wedding and I would attend my dad's 50th birthday party. This didn't go down well with Beth's family.\n- As my money increased and Beth let slip to her siblings how much I was earning she started getting messages from her mum and other family members to borrow money. She would ask me as I'm the sole earner in the house and 90% of the time I would say no. This lead to me being \"better than them\" and clearly don't earn enough money to support my family. \n- Comments had been made by Beth's mum at the beginning of our relationship about me having a daughter from a previous relationship and despite Beth giving her full details of the hell that relationship was and how difficult it had been to see my daughter she would make backhanded comments about dead beat dad's and how I would leave Beth to go back to my real family. \n- Beth's mum has 4 kids from 4 different dad's and from Beth's recollections from her childhood each year there would be a different man living in their house. Fair to say healthy relationships aren't her speciality.\n- Beth's dad shared some details of when he left her mum, short summary is he was baby trapped and as he comes from a religious family was almost forced into marriage before he cut ties with his own family. She would also refuse to let him see Beth and would tell her that her dad didn't want to see her. Which lead to the complete breakdown of Beth and her dad's relationship", ">Beth's mum has a drinking problem\n\n>Beth's mum showed up at our house demanding to take our son out for the day\n\n>She got angry and started shouting at the doorstep before trying to barge past me into the house.\n\nNTA. You and Beth need to sit down and discuss the boundaries and expectations you wish to enforce on this Trainwreck. You two need to be on the same page and Beth needs to take the lead on communicating with her crazy family.", "NTA. All other differences aside, don't ever let a practising alcoholic be in charge of your son. There is not much good to be said about even having drunks around, even if the parents are there, keeping an eye on things.", "NTA. A good friend told her son's grandma (when she arrive unexpectedly,) that she already had plans for the day with her son and to please give her a couple days notice if she wanted a grandma and baby day so that my friend could at least plan her life.\n\nHer (not,) MIL was not happy. But, what are you supposed to do? You can't be at the mercy of their hostilities all the time. \"Beth it not your mom's and stepdad's or your grandmother's baby. Its *our* baby and I'm not bending over backwards while they behave like toddlers. We don't have two yes votes here. We have one resounding NO. One no is all it takes for you to see we are not on the same page about this. The three of us are also a family.\"", "Clearly, you have a case for no contact with the parents, but Beth needs to be on board with the decisions and it sounds like she doesn\u2019t agree about her grandmother. This doesn\u2019t mean grandma gets to take your son wherever she wants, but the two of you can come up with an agreement that makes the two of you feel seen and respected. NTA", "NTA. Someone in active addiction who's trying to shove past you into your home while screaming is not someone who should be allowed in your home or able to have unsupervised visits with your son currently. Being an older lady doesn't make that behavior any more OK. \n\nBeth may need your support as having a narcissistic/toxic family member can warp your sense of normalcy and erode your boundaries. So I would try to be as kind as possible to her while keeping your son safe and your boundaries firm.", "Beth has been conditioned by her mother to accept this behavior as normal. Beth needs to agree with the these conditions, which she probably will initially. She will agree until her mother guilts her into submission to what her mother wants. Beth needs individual therapy, if possible like right now. Her mother is abusive and an alcoholic,  thinks nothing of stepping on and over you both, she will not follow any parenting decisions you make regarding your son, it is going to be an on going constant battle. And will get worse when her mother uses your child to make you the bad guy and you'll have 2 tantrums to deal with, this is not an if, but a when. Say son can't be alone with grandma, grandma will ask son (not you or Beth and probably infront of other people) if he wants to do something fun with just her at a time she knows you both can't go,  and you will be the one to say no, son is upset and grandma is yelling \"look what you did, you're abusive to son\". Beth needs to see this behavior as abusive and want to stop the cycle of generational abuse so your son can grow up happy and healthy. This is the only thing Beth has known, so be patient and speak calmly with her,  but Beth could really benefit having someone outside this drama tell her it isn't normal or healthy. Her mother will stop at nothing, especially blowing up your relationship to get Beth back in line and under her control. You are now her enemy because you aren't allowing her access to an innocent child that she needs as a supply to her narcissism. \n\nI have a narcissistic, alcoholic and abusive mother. I unfortunately did see it as clearly as I do now. It is very hard to enforce boundaries and consequences.", "NTA. Trying to push past you is bad for your child to see. That\u2019s blatant disrespect. And standing pounding on a door is just as bad. While he might not understand now, it won\u2019t be long before he will. It\u2019s better to stick to this boundary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She could get quite defensive of her mother. Be delicate if you suggest this. \n\nI would consider maybe taking coparenting classes.
