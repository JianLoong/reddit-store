A few months after I moved out, Jen showed up at my parents house pregnant and with a baby. They took her in again then called me and my brothers asking how we feel about her staying with them. My brothers were ok with it but I can\u2019t forgive her for what she did a few years ago. \n\nMy parents let her stay anyways but said they had conditions on her staying with them like her going to therapy and either enrolling in college or getting a job.

Time to let this go and be a bigger person.", "OK, let me unroll this for you:\n\n1. You had a friend who was in need of help / a safe space. Not only did you think it was appropriate to ask her out in a situation where she was somehow depending on you / your family, you also thought it was necessary to \"convince\" her when she initially refused. You are already pushing hard to be TA right there, but I'm giving you the benefit of young age here. You probably did not realise how abusive your behaviour was back then. I hope you do now.\n\n2. You went out for ONE date, and she \"broke up\" with you the next day? Let's rephrase that as \"she was not interested in a second date\" because, honestly, there was nothing to break up. Going on one date did not make you a couple. If you can't see that even years later, then clearly, you are taking another huge step to being TA.\n\n3. Your (former) friend, whom your parents have a deep relationship with, is in need of help, and your parents are willing to provide that for her. Not blindly, but based on the condition that she seeks professional help as well. If it hasn't been said before, let me the first so say: God bless them! I wish there were more people like your parents in this world! And yet, you resent their behaviour. Because of what? Because that girl did not want to date you? And not visiting is your way of \"punishing\" them? You asked for it, here it is: YTA.\n\nIf you don't want to go visit your parents, then don't go. You might be doing everyone a favour. But if you go, you might want to apologise to your friend for your behaviour in the past. Because, even though you called her a \"friend\" back then, you have not been one. Chances are that you have actually contributed to her leaving your parents' house in the middle of the night.", ">I can\u2019t forgive her for what she did a few years ago\n\n... Checks notes...

Cause all I'm seeing is that she needs help and your parents are willing to help her, but you're still being petty about things from years ago that were your fault. If anyone should be angry, it should be her for how you treated her.", "YTA. She's a young girl in a bad situation. She found some adults she could trust, the parents of a friend, and everything was going well into said friend pressured her into dating when she clearly wasn't interested. Them she lost the friend, and support network when she established her boundaries only to reach back out years later.\n\nYou went on one fucking date. I get you probably had strong feelings. It happens when we're young and inexperienced, and yeah, it stings when they don't reciprocate. But you should be grown. Get over yourself.", "YTA.\n\nYou bullied her into dating you and then when she came back after a few weeks, hoping you'd be over it, you bullied her out of your house too. \n\nShe was what, 14, 15? And you're actually mad that a 14-15 year old girl didn't make perfect choices when she was treated badly by you in the place that she used to see as her safe haven and you turned it into another place of misery for her?\n\nAnd you're really not seeing things from her perspective either. Clearly she learned that if you feel you have to leave, forget your stuff, and leave when no one can stop you. Notice how she turned up in the middle of the night according to you and also LEFT in the middle of the night from your place?\n\nI can almost guarantee you that is because she was previously hurt trying to leave at other times by other people and the scars from that meant when you made her feel miserable in the place she used to feel safe, she didn't feel safe telling you she was leaving. Her trauma told her that you would hurt her if she did or not let her leave.\n\nSHE likely felt incredibly betrayed that her best friend didn't accept no for an answer then after weeks of space, still decided when she showed up, to act like a jerk to her for weeks. SHE was likely worried that you weren't going to ever stop or were going to escalate like the people in her home life. SHE must have felt miserable and rejected having her best friend turn on her so easily and must have felt so afraid that other people could do that too.\n\nYour parents are also seeing what you aren't: Jen's bad home life set her up to fail and make the mistakes and errors in judgement she has. And they want to set her up with actual stability, resources etc. because they are kind caring people and have known her since she was a young child and want her to succeed.\n\nMake it your hill to die on if you want, but you won't get what you want by doing so, you'll just hurt your parents and that gives them all the more reason to choose her over you when she's not the one giving them ultimatums.", "YTA.

Your house was a haven for Jen, and possibly one of the only safe places she had access to. Instead of just being her friend through those difficult times, you badgered her into a date that she clearly wasn't interested in. (Here's a hint, girls who are into you don't need \"convincing.\") When she got desperate enough to turn to your family despite your boorish behavior, you were still hung up on the rejection and gave her a hard time. This girl was in crisis, and you prioritized your romantic hopes and injured pride over her actual well-being.\n\nAnd now, many years later, you're still holding that grudge even though you're the one who wronged her in the first place.

If your whole family is ok with it and forgiven her for running away, you shouldnt really have a problem with her.\n\nYou have a right to be hurt from rejection (it sucks) and your not obligated to go for Christmas obviously but if you could find it in yourself to apologise, swallow the pride and head home, everyone, including yourself would probs be happier in the long run", "Ya'll went on one date after you convinced(bullied) her into it.

She was your friend and took solace in your home because her homelife was horrendous. She wasn't there for just you, it was for your family.

You\u2019re her best friend and have been for years, your parents see her as family and she probably thought the same, and had a safe escape from her awful home life - and then you spring this on her and she can\u2019t say no outright because she owes you and now the whole friendship is tainted and she\u2019s lost her safety and her best friend and her surrogate family. So since you won\u2019t take no she agrees and gives it a chance of one date but can\u2019t go on with that so dumps you. Was it cowardly? Maybe but she\u2019s in a tough place and I don\u2019t blame her\n\nShe avoids you for weeks - but then in the middle of the night shows up. What happened that meant she had no other options? To drive her from her house to yours at an unsociable hour? \n\nBut you - her former best friend - make it clear that even though your parents are happy to welcome her you are not. So she\u2019s in this situation of being unwelcome - and by somebody she trusted for years.\n\nSo she leaves - because you drove her out. \n\nYou never really go into any of what she is experiencing but she\u2019s young, she had a bad home life, and now she\u2019s pregnant and she shows back up \n\nJust try and imagine how desperate she must have felt to come back to your parents. \n\nThroughout this post you don\u2019t even seem concerned about how your parents feel, let alone Jen despite the fact she was your friend for so long.

A lot of the problem she's having now are because of what you did to her. She didn't have a stable home, and then when she thought she had a stable home she discovered she is in a worst situation - it's not a safe place at all: she either needs to put out or be homeless or be on the guard from a man who doesn't take no for an answer- every woman worst nightmare, and she isn't even 18. So her all childhood she was either in unstable condition or in constant threat of sexual violence - it doesn't have to be a rape in the ally, it can be constant bullying if you don't go on 'dates'. So you ruined what was left of her childhood, and now complaining she is a broken person, and again demanding she should become homeless because she didn't put out - because why only ruin a childhood if you can ruin her adulthood as well for not putting out. You are the problem. Jen could have flourished, you could have flourished, but you trapped her and your family life in your little control fantasy, taking her childhood and stability out of her life, living her more broken - childhood is when your foundation is built, you are a more rocky person if your foundation weren't built stable - and she got a second chance at stability (a miracle), and you took it from her.\n\nYou need to forgive her? No no no. She needs to forgive *you* for something that is unforgivable.\n\n\"and I held true to my word and I haven\u2019t visited since.\" - Good.

Theyve known Jen since she was probably 5 or 6 years old", "It doesn't sound like Jen actually wants OP as a 'platonic company'. Jen ran away from OP's home at the age of 15 due to OP's bullying, even though her homelife was obviously really bad.
