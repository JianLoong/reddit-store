Time to let this go and be a bigger person.", "OK, let me unroll this for you:\n\n1. You had a friend who was in need of help / a safe space. Not only did you think it was appropriate to ask her out in a situation where she was somehow depending on you / your family, you also thought it was necessary to \"convince\" her when she initially refused. You are already pushing hard to be TA right there, but I'm giving you the benefit of young age here. You probably did not realise how abusive your behaviour was back then. I hope you do now.\n\n2. You went out for ONE date, and she \"broke up\" with you the next day? Let's rephrase that as \"she was not interested in a second date\" because, honestly, there was nothing to break up. Going on one date did not make you a couple. If you can't see that even years later, then clearly, you are taking another huge step to being TA.\n\n3. Your (former) friend, whom your parents have a deep relationship with, is in need of help, and your parents are willing to provide that for her. Not blindly, but based on the condition that she seeks professional help as well. If it hasn't been said before, let me the first so say: God bless them! I wish there were more people like your parents in this world! And yet, you resent their behaviour. Because of what? Because that girl did not want to date you? And not visiting is your way of \"punishing\" them? You asked for it, here it is: YTA.\n\nIf you don't want to go visit your parents, then don't go. You might be doing everyone a favour. But if you go, you might want to apologise to your friend for your behaviour in the past. Because, even though you called her a \"friend\" back then, you have not been one. Chances are that you have actually contributed to her leaving your parents' house in the middle of the night.", ">I can\u2019t forgive her for what she did a few years ago\n\n... Checks notes...

Cause all I'm seeing is that she needs help and your parents are willing to help her, but you're still being petty about things from years ago that were your fault. If anyone should be angry, it should be her for how you treated her.", "YTA. She's a young girl in a bad situation. She found some adults she could trust, the parents of a friend, and everything was going well into said friend pressured her into dating when she clearly wasn't interested. Them she lost the friend, and support network when she established her boundaries only to reach back out years later.\n\nYou went on one fucking date. I get you probably had strong feelings. It happens when we're young and inexperienced, and yeah, it stings when they don't reciprocate. But you should be grown. Get over yourself.", "YTA.\n\nYou bullied her into dating you and then when she came back after a few weeks, hoping you'd be over it, you bullied her out of your house too. \n\nShe was what, 14, 15? And you're actually mad that a 14-15 year old girl didn't make perfect choices when she was treated badly by you in the place that she used to see as her safe haven and you turned it into another place of misery for her?\n\nAnd you're really not seeing things from her perspective either. Clearly she learned that if you feel you have to leave, forget your stuff, and leave when no one can stop you. Notice how she turned up in the middle of the night according to you and also LEFT in the middle of the night from your place?\n\nI can almost guarantee you that is because she was previously hurt trying to leave at other times by other people and the scars from that meant when you made her feel miserable in the place she used to feel safe, she didn't feel safe telling you she was leaving. Her trauma told her that you would hurt her if she did or not let her leave.\n\nSHE likely felt incredibly betrayed that her best friend didn't accept no for an answer then after weeks of space, still decided when she showed up, to act like a jerk to her for weeks. SHE was likely worried that you weren't going to ever stop or were going to escalate like the people in her home life. SHE must have felt miserable and rejected having her best friend turn on her so easily and must have felt so afraid that other people could do that too.\n\nYour parents are also seeing what you aren't: Jen's bad home life set her up to fail and make the mistakes and errors in judgement she has. And they want to set her up with actual stability, resources etc. because they are kind caring people and have known her since she was a young child and want her to succeed.\n\nMake it your hill to die on if you want, but you won't get what you want by doing so, you'll just hurt your parents and that gives them all the more reason to choose her over you when she's not the one giving them ultimatums.", "YTA. You\u2019re such a massive asshole and haven\u2019t matured AT ALL.

Your house was a haven for Jen, and possibly one of the only safe places she had access to. Instead of just being her friend through those difficult times, you badgered her into a date that she clearly wasn't interested in. (Here's a hint, girls who are into you don't need \"convincing.\") When she got desperate enough to turn to your family despite your boorish behavior, you were still hung up on the rejection and gave her a hard time. This girl was in crisis, and you prioritized your romantic hopes and injured pride over her actual well-being.\n\nAnd now, many years later, you're still holding that grudge even though you're the one who wronged her in the first place. If you'd been less selfish towards Jen back in high school, things might have gone pretty differently for her.", "INFO: How is it a breakup after one date?", "YTA.\n\nIn 9th grade you pressured her into a date she never wanted, and then got pissed when she told you after the date that she still didn't feel that way for you.\n\nAnd you've held a years-long grudge over that.\n\nShe grew up rough, and had no safe place to fall except your parents, and you want to take that from her too, because your teenage crush wasn't reciprocated?\n\nI'm having trouble seeing where she ever did anything wrong to you.

Grow up.", "YTA, even ignoring the \"I admit I didn\u2019t love having her around and didn\u2019t make it easy on her\" which probably could be it's whole own thread that wouldnt look to good on your part, I think if your honest with yourself, you'd recognise your doing this almost entirely out of spite for being rejected in the past. If your whole family is ok with it and forgiven her for running away, you shouldnt really have a problem with her.\n\nYou have a right to be hurt from rejection (it sucks) and your not obligated to go for Christmas obviously but if you could find it in yourself to apologise, swallow the pride and head home, everyone, including yourself would probs be happier in the long run", "Ya'll went on one date after you convinced(bullied) her into it. I'll bet money she felt cornered and scared.\n\nYTA. She didnt do a damn thing to you. You are being petty.", "Look up \"nice guy\" and then look in the mirror. She was your friend and took solace in your home because her homelife was horrendous. She wasn't there for just you, it was for your family.

You\u2019re her best friend and have been for years, your parents see her as family and she probably thought the same, and had a safe escape from her awful home life - and then you spring this on her and she can\u2019t say no outright because she owes you and now the whole friendship is tainted and she\u2019s lost her safety and her best friend and her surrogate family. So since you won\u2019t take no she agrees and gives it a chance of one date but can\u2019t go on with that so dumps you. Was it cowardly? Maybe but she\u2019s in a tough place and I don\u2019t blame her\n\nShe avoids you for weeks - but then in the middle of the night shows up. What happened that meant she had no other options? To drive her from her house to yours at an unsociable hour? \n\nBut you - her former best friend - make it clear that even though your parents are happy to welcome her you are not. So she\u2019s in this situation of being unwelcome - and by somebody she trusted for years.\n\nSo she leaves - because you drove her out. \n\nYou never really go into any of what she is experiencing but she\u2019s young, she had a bad home life, and now she\u2019s pregnant and she shows back up \n\nJust try and imagine how desperate she must have felt to come back to your parents. \n\nThroughout this post you don\u2019t even seem concerned about how your parents feel, let alone Jen despite the fact she was your friend for so long.

A lot of the problem she's having now are because of what you did to her. She didn't have a stable home, and then when she thought she had a stable home she discovered she is in a worst situation - it's not a safe place at all: she either needs to put out or be homeless or be on the guard from a man who doesn't take no for an answer- every woman worst nightmare, and she isn't even 18. So her all childhood she was either in unstable condition or in constant threat of sexual violence - it doesn't have to be a rape in the ally, it can be constant bullying if you don't go on 'dates'. So you ruined what was left of her childhood, and now complaining she is a broken person, and again demanding she should become homeless because she didn't put out - because why only ruin a childhood if you can ruin her adulthood as well for not putting out. You are the problem. Jen could have flourished, you could have flourished, but you trapped her and your family life in your little control fantasy, taking her childhood and stability out of her life, living her more broken - childhood is when your foundation is built, you are a more rocky person if your foundation weren't built stable - and she got a second chance at stability (a miracle), and you took it from her.\n\nYou need to forgive her? No no no. She needs to forgive *you* for something that is unforgivable.\n\n\"and I held true to my word and I haven\u2019t visited since.\" - Good.

And if she does fuck up a lot it's probably due to her horrible upbringing during her formative years where she missed out on a hell of a lot of proper parenting, if she got any at. She's obviously had nobody other than your family to model how to parent her own child.  How fortunate you came from a family that was loving enough to care for a kid that was not their own. Are there perhaps jealousy issues?\n\n As far as the rejection, you seriously need to get over it. We've all been rejected, cheated on, dumped, some left at the altar.  And we've all managed to get over it in our own ways and times. But your time is LONG over. \n\nThis is the most overused comment on Reddit, but in this case I think it's spot on. Go see a therapist. It can make or break your family and get to the root of your issues with this girl.\n\nIt sounds like YOU'RE the one making your parents choose between you and her.", "Your going to have to be more specific.  What we see is a girl looking for safety, that was driven away by a horny boy.  So she sought safety elsewhere.", "No, she didn't. Your parents were adults then and are adults now and are therefore entirely capable of deciding for themselves whether they were willing to take on the responsibility they've taken on. You're just salty as hell because because she didn't want to date you. The fact that you're brooding heavily over this like a b-movie villain years and years later proves she made the right decision in that situation.", "So just like any child with their parent, they\u2019re there to support her regardless of the situation. You\u2019re not her ex and she owed you nothing. Imagine being so self centred and entitled. Your parents have forgiven her and moved on. Build a bridge dude.", "I guess if she was banging you like you so desperately want, she wouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "It sounds like you\u2019re the reason she left so maybe if you would have never coerced her into dating you your family wouldn\u2019t have had to go through a lot from her leaving.", "You put her through a lot, until she felt that she needed to leave and couldn't face saying why. All through what sounds like a really difficult and unstable time when an actual friend should have been supporting her. You have a chance to actually vaguely redeem yourself and be an adult but you're pissing that away too.", "YOU put your family through a lot.

Even without the date part, stay with your newborn in the house of your former friend and by that indirectly causing a rift in the family is not gonna end well for her - is not her fault, but by \"picking her side\" it comes expectations and strings that even with all the best intentions from OPs parents I don't think will do any good. \n\n\nIs easier said than done, but the sooner she finds a place to herself the better will be for her and the baby.", "EXACTLY! \n\nOP definitely YTA", "Your username is cringe.

I\u2019m embarrassed for you.", "i\u2019m assuming you do the same, since you\u2019re clearly super entitled. why do only you deserve her parents love? everybody in that house belongs to you huh?", "Because she has no one else to turn to. Who would you turn to if your life fell apart? She runs to them because they are safe, because they care about her and because they don\u2019t abuse her like her family obviously did. Do you really begrudge a homeless pregnant woman with a small child a safe place to get back on her feet? Like think it through, objectively. YTA", "Yeah a 9th grader not going to school for weeks then showing up at a friend's house in the middle of the night?\n\nSomething was really, really wrong at home.  And his parents took her in because they recognized that.  If they've known her since preschool they've probably tried to be a stabilizing force for her for her whole life.\n\nThis poor kid.

The fact that he\u2019s still that resentful and spiteful after all this time speaks volume.\nIt was only one date that she clearly was coerced into accepting and he calls her his ex.\nThe guy is delusional.", "I\u2019m glad I found this because as I read everything I kept thinking \u201chow bad is her home life that she keeps going back to OP\u2019s house?\u201d.

You made her feel unsafe in the only safe place she had, and she chose to protect your reputation with your family. She didn\u2019t put your parents through anything, you put your parents through a lot AND are continuing to do so by giving them grief for welcoming her back. Want to help your parents? Don\u2019t go home for Christmas, but do send them a copy of this, surely you want them to understand your side of this and you explain it so eloquently here it really would be a shame for them to miss out on reading it.

That then made the entire situation uncomfortable, distressing and maybe even dangerous for her (just going off how angry, unreasonable and unforgiving you are still after growing up), so much so that she ran off leaving every thing behind. \n\nYTA. It's no doubt taken her a lot to ask for this help. Grow up. Let your parents take her in, apologize to her and go to therapy and try to be a better human being.", "Okay, listen up: you say they consider Jen their daughter, right? Well, when she left, she wasn't just a rude house guest, she was their child. They lost a child, that night.\n\nFor most parents, that would be absolutely devastating. And a lot of parents who do go through this, they never get a chance to see that child alive again.\n\nYour parents are lucky in that regard. They got to see her again. They got to know she's alive. They got a chance to make sure she stays alive and leads a good life.\n\nI implore you to consider: do you really wish that the immense relief and joy your parents are feeling at her safe return would turn into the same anger and resentment you have? Are your feelings of hurt really that important that you'd rather see them anxious and depressed, all over again, because they wouldn't know whether she was safe or not?", "You do realize she left because of you?
