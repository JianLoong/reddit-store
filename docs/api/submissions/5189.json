Time to let this go and be a bigger person.", "OK, let me unroll this for you:\n\n1. You had a friend who was in need of help / a safe space. Not only did you think it was appropriate to ask her out in a situation where she was somehow depending on you / your family, you also thought it was necessary to \"convince\" her when she initially refused. You are already pushing hard to be TA right there, but I'm giving you the benefit of young age here. You probably did not realise how abusive your behaviour was back then. I hope you do now.\n\n2. You went out for ONE date, and she \"broke up\" with you the next day? Let's rephrase that as \"she was not interested in a second date\" because, honestly, there was nothing to break up. Going on one date did not make you a couple. If you can't see that even years later, then clearly, you are taking another huge step to being TA.\n\n3. Your (former) friend, whom your parents have a deep relationship with, is in need of help, and your parents are willing to provide that for her. Not blindly, but based on the condition that she seeks professional help as well. If it hasn't been said before, let me the first so say: God bless them! I wish there were more people like your parents in this world! And yet, you resent their behaviour. Because of what? Because that girl did not want to date you? And not visiting is your way of \"punishing\" them? You asked for it, here it is: YTA.\n\nIf you don't want to go visit your parents, then don't go. You might be doing everyone a favour. But if you go, you might want to apologise to your friend for your behaviour in the past. Because, even though you called her a \"friend\" back then, you have not been one.

Cause all I'm seeing is that she needs help and your parents are willing to help her, but you're still being petty about things from years ago that were your fault. If anyone should be angry, it should be her for how you treated her.", "YTA. She's a young girl in a bad situation. She found some adults she could trust, the parents of a friend, and everything was going well into said friend pressured her into dating when she clearly wasn't interested. Them she lost the friend, and support network when she established her boundaries only to reach back out years later.\n\nYou went on one fucking date. I get you probably had strong feelings. It happens when we're young and inexperienced, and yeah, it stings when they don't reciprocate. But you should be grown. Get over yourself.", "YTA.\n\nYou bullied her into dating you and then when she came back after a few weeks, hoping you'd be over it, you bullied her out of your house too. \n\nShe was what, 14, 15? And you're actually mad that a 14-15 year old girl didn't make perfect choices when she was treated badly by you in the place that she used to see as her safe haven and you turned it into another place of misery for her?\n\nAnd you're really not seeing things from her perspective either. Clearly she learned that if you feel you have to leave, forget your stuff, and leave when no one can stop you. Notice how she turned up in the middle of the night according to you and also LEFT in the middle of the night from your place?\n\nI can almost guarantee you that is because she was previously hurt trying to leave at other times by other people and the scars from that meant when you made her feel miserable in the place she used to feel safe, she didn't feel safe telling you she was leaving. Her trauma told her that you would hurt her if she did or not let her leave.\n\nSHE likely felt incredibly betrayed that her best friend didn't accept no for an answer then after weeks of space, still decided when she showed up, to act like a jerk to her for weeks. SHE was likely worried that you weren't going to ever stop or were going to escalate like the people in her home life. SHE must have felt miserable and rejected having her best friend turn on her so easily and must have felt so afraid that other people could do that too.\n\nYour parents are also seeing what you aren't: Jen's bad home life set her up to fail and make the mistakes and errors in judgement she has. And they want to set her up with actual stability, resources etc. because they are kind caring people and have known her since she was a young child and want her to succeed.\n\nMake it your hill to die on if you want, but you won't get what you want by doing so, you'll just hurt your parents and that gives them all the more reason to choose her over you when she's not the one giving them ultimatums.", "YTA. You\u2019re such a massive asshole and haven\u2019t matured AT ALL. Like you\u2019ve spent no time reflecting on this poor girl\u2019s life and that your immature choices forced her to leave the loving home she had with your family because you wanted to date her. \n\nIf I were your parents I\u2019d choose her over you as well!", "Info: You say you didn't make it easy on her but what did you actually do?\n\nBecause it sounds like you bullied her until she ran away to escape you.", "YTA. Your house was a haven for Jen, and possibly one of the only safe places she had access to. Instead of just being her friend through those difficult times, you badgered her into a date that she clearly wasn't interested in. (Here's a hint, girls who are into you don't need \"convincing.\") When she got desperate enough to turn to your family despite your boorish behavior, you were still hung up on the rejection and gave her a hard time. This girl was in crisis, and you prioritized your romantic hopes and injured pride over her actual well-being.\n\nAnd now, many years later, you're still holding that grudge even though you're the one who wronged her in the first place. If you'd been less selfish towards Jen back in high school, things might have gone pretty differently for her.", "INFO: How is it a breakup after one date?", "YTA.\n\nIn 9th grade you pressured her into a date she never wanted, and then got pissed when she told you after the date that she still didn't feel that way for you.\n\nAnd you've held a years-long grudge over that.\n\nShe grew up rough, and had no safe place to fall except your parents, and you want to take that from her too, because your teenage crush wasn't reciprocated?\n\nI'm having trouble seeing where she ever did anything wrong to you.

Grow up.", "YTA, even ignoring the \"I admit I didn\u2019t love having her around and didn\u2019t make it easy on her\" which probably could be it's whole own thread that wouldnt look to good on your part, I think if your honest with yourself, you'd recognise your doing this almost entirely out of spite for being rejected in the past. If your whole family is ok with it and forgiven her for running away, you shouldnt really have a problem with her.\n\nYou have a right to be hurt from rejection (it sucks) and your not obligated to go for Christmas obviously but if you could find it in yourself to apologise, swallow the pride and head home, everyone, including yourself would probs be happier in the long run", "Ya'll went on one date after you convinced(bullied) her into it. I'll bet money she felt cornered and scared.\n\nYTA. She didnt do a damn thing to you. You are being petty.", "Look up \"nice guy\" and then look in the mirror. She was your friend and took solace in your home because her homelife was horrendous. She wasn't there for just you, it was for your family.

You\u2019re her best friend and have been for years, your parents see her as family and she probably thought the same, and had a safe escape from her awful home life - and then you spring this on her and she can\u2019t say no outright because she owes you and now the whole friendship is tainted and she\u2019s lost her safety and her best friend and her surrogate family. So since you won\u2019t take no she agrees and gives it a chance of one date but can\u2019t go on with that so dumps you. Was it cowardly? Maybe but she\u2019s in a tough place and I don\u2019t blame her\n\nShe avoids you for weeks - but then in the middle of the night shows up. What happened that meant she had no other options? To drive her from her house to yours at an unsociable hour? \n\nBut you - her former best friend - make it clear that even though your parents are happy to welcome her you are not. So she\u2019s in this situation of being unwelcome - and by somebody she trusted for years.\n\nSo she leaves - because you drove her out. \n\nYou never really go into any of what she is experiencing but she\u2019s young, she had a bad home life, and now she\u2019s pregnant and she shows back up \n\nJust try and imagine how desperate she must have felt to come back to your parents. \n\nThroughout this post you don\u2019t even seem concerned about how your parents feel, let alone Jen despite the fact she was your friend for so long.

A lot of the problem she's having now are because of what you did to her. She didn't have a stable home, and then when she thought she had a stable home she discovered she is in a worst situation - it's not a safe place at all: she either needs to put out or be homeless or be on the guard from a man who doesn't take no for an answer- every woman worst nightmare, and she isn't even 18. So her all childhood she was either in unstable condition or in constant threat of sexual violence - it doesn't have to be a rape in the ally, it can be constant bullying if you don't go on 'dates'. So you ruined what was left of her childhood, and now complaining she is a broken person, and again demanding she should become homeless because she didn't put out - because why only ruin a childhood if you can ruin her adulthood as well for not putting out. You are the problem. Jen could have flourished, you could have flourished, but you trapped her and your family life in your little control fantasy, taking her childhood and stability out of her life, living her more broken - childhood is when your foundation is built, you are a more rocky person if your foundation weren't built stable - and she got a second chance at stability (a miracle), and you took it from her.\n\nYou need to forgive her? No no no. She needs to forgive *you* for something that is unforgivable.\n\n\"and I held true to my word and I haven\u2019t visited since.\" - Good.

Knowing her history, and the fact that they love her and want to be there to support her, welcoming her into their home and trying to help her get on her feet also is understandable. Truthfully right now she needs their support more than you do. Family isn\u2019t always blood, and they see her as family. \n\nI do think you should get some therapy to deal with this resentment you have towards her. It isn\u2019t heathly to be this upset about a one date break up and I think you need someone to help guide you through your parents feelings and decisions with regards to her. They see her as a daughter, and even when your child makes poor decisions and hurts you, you help pick them back up when they fall. The only people who get to decided if what she did was too much for them to ever take her back are your parents. \n\nYou\u2019re couching this as being protective of your parents, but they don\u2019t need your protection. I think this is just a deflection from you feeling hurt that they chose to do this even when you didn\u2019t want them to. You coerced her into dating you and got upset that she ended by text after one date. You were like 14/15 when this happened, right in the range of ridiculously butthurt over minor things stage, and while still in the midst of that, she moved in a couple of weeks later. A bigger gap of time might have given you time space to get over the disappointment and go back to being friends, but you hadn\u2019t had a chance to that yet and her need at the time was urgent. Any processing you had been doing was arrested at that point. Go to therapy and let them walk you to the acceptance step of grief. Until then don\u2019t go home, but tell your parents you are trying to work through your feelings in therapy and hopefully that can mean a future without this level of distance needed.

And you've been an asshole to your so called best friend ever since.... After ONE date? So in your head, she didn't have a right to say no to you? Yeah dude, you are 100% an asshole. You are not entitled to date her. You are not entitled to her love. You are not entitled to anything else you wanted from her. And it sounds like her home life was hell and she desperately needed help and support, and you just dumped her as a friend because you care more about your hurt ego than you did about your \"friend\".

You then bullying her afterwards and making her lose the possibly only place that felt like a home makes you an even bigger AH.\n\nThat being said, I can however sympathize with is not wanting to be around someone you had a crush on that didn't reciprocate the feelings. That is a perfectly natural thing. Stuff like that is always very awkward, even in the best circumstances. I'd suggest you try looking into therapy to talk to someone about those feelings which you obviously were unable to work through. \n\nAs for christmas you have, in my opinion, two choices:\n\n1. Agree to go home, but be up front to your parents about not wanting to directly interact with Jen for the time being because you are uncomfortable. See how it is being around her and base your next steps (like therapy) off of that experience.\n2. Stay at college, sulk and depriving yourself of a possibly nice time because you can't get over yourself.\n\nI understand that you're frustrated about your parents \"chosing\" Jen over you, but they aren't doing that. They are just trying to do something very decent for someone that was, in your words, like their own child for a long time. There is no perfect solution for this at the moment. Jen by now has two little kids and probably nobody else willing to help her. She doesn't have a great life. Your parents are trying to make it a little less shitty. \n\nIn case you are starting to debate whether or not to go home after the feedback in this thread and are on the fence about it, think about this:   \n**You'd be surprised how much your feelings about someone can change just by seeing them in person again. You still have the version of her that you had a crush on in your head. The version that didn't love you back like that, even though you, in your head, did nice things for her. That's what your grudge is about. 14/15 year old Jen. Not current Jen. Chances are that she is a completely different person at this point and as soon as you see her, that hatred just disappers.**   \n**Trust me, it happened to me with multiple people I considered close friends and then thought I'd hate forever because of something dumb that happened between us when we were teenagers. We never ended up being super close again like before, but we ended up being able to coexist in spaces and have quite nice conversations about how idiotic we all were.**", "YTA\n\nSo your being pathetic due to her not wanting to date you?

She was avoiding YOU. \n\nI went through a ROUGH life as well and it\u2019s always depressing when you have a male friend you think is true but then they make a move or don\u2019t accept your boundaries, and it\u2019s a huge damper and a reminder that men aren\u2019t a safe space for us. \n\nA little bit of psychology for you\u2026 she had a bad home life and trusted you and your parents to be her safe space. She thought she had a friend who would show her the love and protection she wasn\u2019t receiving at home. She may have even been abused, actually I\u2019d be willing to bet based on the rest of your story that she was. An overwhelming number of young girls with unstable home lives are sexually abused at some point by someone. She probably has a bad relationship with men and a deep mistrust of them. She saw YOU as her only true male friend who was protective and not like other men she knew in life. Then you expressed interest and it probably hurt her on the level that she suddenly felt trapped. She felt like she couldn\u2019t say no. There was a power imbalance in your relationship (her relying on you and your parents to be her surrogate family of sorts) that *YOU EXPLOITED* and in doing so, you made yourself and your home an unsafe place for her. \n\nShe probably showed up at your house after being low contact because she was dealing with things that are so far beyond your sheltered little understanding of life. \n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating to read this from your point of you because I grew up in a situation extremely similar to hers. I\u2019ve bounced around friends houses and couches and was the \u201cdaughter\u201d their parents never had, too. You are so selfish and coddled that you can\u2019t even conceptualize what she was going through!!!!!! Abuse is likely the tip of what she was dealing with if her LEAVING HOME was not alarming to her caregivers. \n\nShe likely left your home because I\u2019m willing to bet YOU made her feel unwelcome, unsafe & uncomfortable because she wouldn\u2019t date you/flirt or whatever. Imagine being in a *predator\u2019s* home and having to deal with them? She probably got that enough at home so why would she stay with your family when she felt unsafe *because of you*? \n\nShe was gone for years (so she dropped out I\u2019m assuming) and she showed up as a young teen mother seeking help from trusted adults. She showed up *knowing you were gone and she was safe there now*. Her love/trust for your parents was tarnished by YOU and she\u2019s working to recover and reconcile the relationship between them. \n\nHer becoming a mother so young likely means that she was being sexually abused. She could have been raped, she could be carrying her abusers child/carried one before already if she has a young one as well. Either way, her upbringing was not conducive to teaching her about developing healthy attachments, she likely has bad relationships with men she chooses/dates. (commonly called daddy issues - which is insensitive in itself). They may abuse her, expose her to unsafe situations, etc, but you\u2019re so self centered that you can\u2019t see any of that. HER LIFE IS SO FAR OUT OF YOUR GRASP TO UNDERSTAND!! \n\nEven if you hadn\u2019t said you were in college, I would have pegged you for a kid or someone with zero life experience based on your self absorbed and skewed view of the world around you and the experiences of others. \n\nI got my degree in psychology. I\u2019m home with my kiddos now mainly investing in real estate, but this was my field for years before my own trauma and the trauma of others became to depressing for me to bear anymore. \n\nso trust me when I say that you need to take a step back, stop being a petulant child and behaving like an incel. YOU are the unsafe party here right now, and you should stay away lest you take out your hurt ego on her even further, or God forbid, her children.\n\nThey\u2019re better off without you around until you can grow up and see the reality outside of your own inner world and into the real one.", "I think all the other comments have covered why YTA", "Omg dude.

It is possible that they may not fully understand the impact of their decision on you, and by expressing your feelings and needs, you can help them to understand your perspective.  \n\n\n  \nAs you navigate this difficult situation, consider turning to Neptune, the god of the sea, for guidance and strength. Neptune is known for his ability to calm and soothe the troubled waters of our lives. By committing to a life of worshiping Neptune, you may find comfort and solace in his presence and strength.  \n\n\n  \nIt may also be helpful to consider seeking the support of a therapist or trusted friend or family member as you work through your feelings about this situation.

We\u2019re all ignoring the fact she left her own home.", "But he\u2019s not an asshole for making them choose between her and him, though. \n\nAt least, not if they make the correct decision of choosing her.", "OP says that his parents called her \u201cthe daughter they never had\u201d, which makes it sound like they had either one child - a boy - or all boys if OP has siblings.", "No he just sounds like your typical Nice Guy who didn\u2019t get what he wanted from her so he decided she no longer had any value as a human.", "Which, judging by the way he worded his post and his comments, is a perfectly reasonable assumption to make... especially for anyone who has a person like OP in their own lives and knows the type from unfortunate experience.", "Good point. Thx", "Op has brothers", "As it is important to realize one\u2019s wrongdoings for such a therapy to work, I fear you are absolutely right.", "I\u2019m genuinely concerned for her.", "Why did your parents need to go to therapy after she was only there for a few weeks? That\u2019s weird.", "You can\u2019t break up with someone you were never with.

That's just pathetic at best and coercion at worst. I would say go and apologize, but she's better off never seeing you again. Yeah, YTA, OP.", "I feel like OP gives of a bit of incel vibes in this post.\n\nOp she is not your ex, going on a date does bot make you a couple, especially since you coerced her into doing it. She was never your gf so she can't be your ex.\nYour post shows a real lack of understanding of how you are how incels tend to be when a woman rejects them. You need to go to therapy.\n\nYTA", "I'm confused myself, but that's what I thought. That he's mad about the leaving... which still.....???  Idk.\nThe one thing I'm sure of is OP is coming across as YTA here", "OP taught her that if you don\u2019t surrender your body to a guy, there\u2019s a price to pay. \n\nHe also taught her that an environment that seems safe might still be risky. \n\nWhat a terrible thing to actively teach a vulnerable young woman. I\u2019m not at all surprised she ended up pregnant; I also wouldn\u2019t assume that sex was consensual.", "Yup. In what ways was he psychologically tormenting her that she felt the need to flee their house in the middle of the night?\n\nIn the same manner that she escaped her own house. YTA", "Yeah...\n\nWTF? What is there to forgive? OP hasn't written anything that needs forgives from him. OPs actions however are way wrong and she can forgive him if she wants. Not the other way around as there is nothing in the text for him to forgive. \n\nYTA and against someone what had a rough upbringing....", "Therapy might have been over whatever their son did to make her leave.", "What do you mean?", "True.", "Either that, or OP isn\u2019t being honest with us about what his parents have actually said to him. They\u2019ve clearly picked her side. OP claims they\u2019re trying to convince him to come for Christmas\u2026I think it\u2019s more likely him saying \u201cI want to come for Christmas but I won\u2019t come if she\u2019s there, make her leave\u201d and them saying \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you for Christmas of course but we are not making her leave.

Gross. \n\nAt first I was like, who chooses some other kid over their own.  But this OP is clearly the exception to that rule, and should do some real work on themselves so they don't actually end up an INCEL, whose own parents won't even talk to him in another few years. \n\nOP- Get some therapy.  Learn about compassion, and develop a gratitude practice. Read some books on adulting and get some real feedback on our attitude (it is terrible). You can have love and friends, and companionship in this life. But not with this attitude you have going on right now.", "YTA- heed this advice, because you are young. Go to a hardware store, buy lumber and nails - build a bridge and get over yourself.", "Wow, you are so YTA. So let me get this right if a girl says no to you she needs to be banned from your world? Are you really that fragile? You have tried to bully and harassed this girl who is in a a desperate situation into not having a home or people who care for her. I really hope you go back and reread what you wrote here and think about it from the opposite side. What if this was you? You are an unbelievably rude to your wonderful family, and to this poor young woman, thank heavens your parents are not as self-centred or egotistically as you are, and are helping her out.\n\nThis is an amazing opportunity for you to grow as a human being, I hope you get some therapy and start to realize that the world does not revolve around you. And that having empathy and caring for people in need is, an amazing trait that your parents have.", "He's mad that she slept with someone else, and had a kid for them. High chances that OP tried to physically pressure the young woman and that is why she was so creeped out/disgusted by him.", "Parents need to put op in therapy.

It\u2019s pretty safe to say he is unhinged and a creeper.", "It makes me sick this incel type can\u2019t see what he robbed this woman of by forcing her from her parent\u2019s house back to her own. God knows what was happening there. What he\u2019s don\u2019t is beyond forgiveness.", "I\u2019ve helped several girls and young women just like this who were trafficked, sold for sex, and/or got sexually coerced by older men.

And your comments are saying \u201cit\u2019s not possible for me to be the father, I haven\u2019t seen her in 5 years\u201d. What did you DO to her on that date? Jesus Christ. Let HER GUARDIANS care for her. Go to therapy.", "YTA. I'm not even sure where to ***start*** with this one. Let's start with what you're leaving out \u2014 since it's **blindingly obvious you aren't telling us the full story.** \n\n* What exactly do you mean when you say \"it took convincing\" to get her to date you?\n* What happened on your date that caused her to nearly drop out of school for several weeks? \n* What exactly did you do to \"make her life difficult\" when she was staying with your parents? \n* ***Why*** **did she** [**leave in the middle of the night without taking her shoes or coat**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqelpn/comment/j113e27/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**?** \n\nMaybe you thought leaving those details out would make you look better. ***It doesn't.*** Reading between the lines here paints a picture that quite simply turns my stomach. \n\nAlso, ***YOU WENT ON ONE DATE WITH THIS GIRL ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO, SHE IS NOT YOUR EX.*** Your conviction that she is alongside the fact that you still hold a grudge against her for ***DARING*** to tell you no is a colossal red flag.

My parents took her in no questions asked then she left in the middle of the night a few weeks later.

A huge, huge AH and there is no version of reality where you are anything but the hugest AH ever.

Because you realize that's what you did, right? Right???", "Am i the only one thinking it is really odd that OP would want to date his best friend since preschool?  Someone that practically lived at his house and that his parents seem to think of as a daughter?   Seems a bit creepy.... almost like wanting to date your sister.", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to have any sort of empathy at all. You bullied and harassed a child with no safe place, and now as an adult rather than reflecting and being ashamed you are doubling down. Shame on you. Your parents should disown you.", "YTA. You badgered her until she went out with you then got mad that she didn't want a relationship. She didn't break up with you. She chose not to engage romantically. She is allowed to do that. It's probably a good thing you're staying away from her. She doesn't need your nonsense.", "YTA - \nHow can you still be so bitter about something that happened in 9th grade?   It\u2019s time to move on.   I could understand being upset if your family was hosting an ex that you have an extensive past with, but this? A single pity date and failed coerced relationship?   Your parents are allowed to host whoever they want in their own home.", "YTA. I don\u2019t personally want to know what you did cause we can all tell it was really bad. The girl is a victim of abuse and you of course went ahead and added to it. You are a terrible friend and not seeming like a good person at all. Just stay away from her. Apologize to your family for trying to make them choose between you and keeping an abuse victim safe. For the record we all think your parents did the right thing and you suck.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m so aggravated at these comments calling the OP an AH. I swear nobody has any empathy anymore.

This is the vibe I was picking up from nearly the beginning. Red flags through the entire story.", "Exactly, it's honestly disgusting.

I have a bad feeling about this whole thing. This is worrying. OP isn't telling us everything, he wants us to think he's the best person in the world. Like the line \"It took some convincing\" makes me feel like he bullied her into agreeing to date him which is an AH move to begin with.
