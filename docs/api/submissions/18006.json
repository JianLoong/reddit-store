I did see your comment about dad fraudulently using your credit, which still doesn\u2019t tell me how much rent you were asking for: 1000 or $3000 for instance? And did you ask for anything else, like money to move your stuff across the country or money to buy new furniture. Everything really depends on what your actual request was and if it was reasonable.

Yet she also decided that giving her own child a small boost was worth less to her than money in the bank.\n\nI can excuse the not helping you with tuition, because so many of us were all in the same boat.  I can even let the not spending money on your graduation party slide.  It was a jerk move, but it was a one time even do I get it.  But someone who was not willing to give their kid a small short term loan on an apartment is not worth your energy.\n\nRight before the pandemic hit, a house in my small town came up for sale $15k cash.  My mom didn't even hesitate to consider making out her HELOC so I could buy it.  Then she dipped into her 401k for the money to replace the roof.  We spent the next 15 months worth of weekends fixing this place up enough to qualify for a mortgage and she got repaid in full.  Now I'm spending the next 6 weeks of weekends helping her husband repair the floor in their own house.", "Helping your child by giving them a *loan* so they can establish themselves in a new city with a great job? No way\n\nThrowing money in the trash can for her brand new criminal boyfriend\u2019s bond and lawyer fees which she\u2019ll never see again? Sounds great!\n\nNTA", "When she has retired and frittered her money away and her boyfriend is doing 10 to 20 years and she comes to you for help, you\u2019ll know what to say to her.", "NTA. You didn't lie, she's a real Shitty McShitterson. When she's old and decrepit with no man around, when she comes crawling around talking about how you \"owe\" her, just tell her sorry, you've got a deadbeat loser bf to bail out of jail. Surely she'll be able to relate to that.", "I would ask the mom if she thinks she will go with OP when shes old", "Hard agree. NTA.\n\nEven without the BF being in trouble, I can\u2019t fathom the mindset of a parent that wouldn\u2019t pay 1 month of rent for their child to move for an excellent job, knowing full well that they can easily do it and that they will get the money back.\n\nLike why not do them just 1 favor to kickstart their career?\n\nAdd in the BF thing, and OP just called a spade a spade. Good on them.", "Yeah. I am a big hater of \"entitlement\" behaviour in anyone, but the mother here has definitely shown her priorities with her choice. I would be hurt if a parent did this with me. Very sad. NTA.", "This. But, at least, OP, you can now go LC or NC with your mom without guilt. She's fine letting you suffer and struggle, but not her BF. That's how important you are to her, so why should she be any more important to you?", "I'll never understand parents like this.\n\nI couldn't imagine putting a love interest over my kid this way.", "The thing I can\u2019t get over is not lending her the $$ to take a great job offer.

I have the right to do all sorts of shitty things and so do you. We\u2019d still be assholes if we did those shitty things, despite being well within our rights.", "Because the kid will never stop being your kid. Even if they stop talking to you, they'll still be your kid. \n\nSOs otoh, can leave you. And then you'll be *gasp* single! So you have to try harder.\n\nIt's a pretty perverse logic, kinda similar to the \"boat steadier\" - they prioritize less stable relationships over more stable ones, bc they're more afraid of losing a bad relationship than interested in maintaining a good one.", "NTA. She IS a shit mom.", "Especially because it simply would have been a loan that OP would have been able to pay back reasonably soon after starting the job!", "i cant even get a housing loan at 22 years old just cause", "NTA for calling her a shitty mom. That is shitty, and it would hurt. However, as you\u2019ve already acknowledged, it\u2019s her money and she gets to choose what to do with it. However, the likely scenario here is that she has used money she planned to keep for retirement and will find herself in need of some help later, and you will be entitled to say no if you so choose.", "NTA", "NTA, she sucks.", "NTA\n\nOver six figures to cover bail but refuses to cover a loan for one month\u2019s rent - A LOAN - so you can take a job and start your adult life?\n\nYeah, I\u2019d be pissed too.", "NTA.

It would be my dream to have enough in savings to help pay tuition or first months rent for my daughter when the time comes (I'm working on it, she's 15 so I have a little time)  As it is I'm working like crazy to help when and how I can.  You are in no way the AH here and not entitled or ungrateful in the least.  For your own mental health I'd strongly consider going low to no contact with her.  \n\nWhen Dave bleeds her dry and leaves her I'm sure she'll come crying to you to help take care of her.  Where's your retirement money now, mother? She's a huge AH, and good for you turning out as a reasonable person, when you could have a lot of resentment.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nUngrateful? What do you have to be grateful for? She treats her felonious lover better than her own child.", "NTA. You made it clear you would pay her back.

I have a mom who makes about $200k a year, house and cars paid off, has worked from home since I was born, MASSIVE savings. She kicked me to the curb at 17 and hasn't helped me since. I'm 24 and the most she's done is sign as a guarantor on my apartments (no financial contributions) because I don't make enough. I've been homeless. I've been jobless. I've been starving. Her philosophy is that if you give your kids money, they'll come to expect it. \n\nFor some reason this only applies to me, and not my brother, who was allowed to live at home until he was 21 (no job, no college, she bought him a car) until he finally took a certification class at a community college and got a job in big tech and moved out.\n\nI'm not entitled to her money in the slightest, but it still stings when she shows what her priorities are.", "Nope NTA. Your moms quite a number tho", "NTA at all, you told the truth. I would literally be homeless if it meant my kid could have those opportunities, and I'm sure most parents feel the same. I'm sorry yours doesn't. Work to create a found family of your own and never look back. \n\nAnd DO NOT HELP HER when she inevitably spends all her money on this loser and comes begging.", "NTA. Sorry you have such a crappy mom.", "NTA, she\u2019s a shitty mom and you were only saying a fact", "NTA\n\nShe made her choices, and she's shown you where her priorities lie.\n\nYou have full power and control over how this relationship goes now.
