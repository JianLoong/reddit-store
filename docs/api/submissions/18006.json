I did see your comment about dad fraudulently using your credit, which still doesn\u2019t tell me how much rent you were asking for: 1000 or $3000 for instance? And did you ask for anything else, like money to move your stuff across the country or money to buy new furniture. Everything really depends on what your actual request was and if it was reasonable.

I can even let the not spending money on your graduation party slide.  It was a jerk move, but it was a one time even do I get it.  But someone who was not willing to give their kid a small short term loan on an apartment is not worth your energy.\n\nRight before the pandemic hit, a house in my small town came up for sale $15k cash.  My mom didn't even hesitate to consider making out her HELOC so I could buy it.  Then she dipped into her 401k for the money to replace the roof.
