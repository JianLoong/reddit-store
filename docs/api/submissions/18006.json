When I got offered a job across the country I asked her to assist me with just the first month's rent and I'd pay her back when I got paid.

But whatever, I managed to get another job closer after 6 months of unemployment.\n\nAll this time she had a savings account with money she'd been saving and what my late step-dad left her. There's a lot of money in there and it wouldn't have rendered her destitute to have helped me in at least one of these occasions but it's her money and I'm really not an entitled kid which is why I never brought it up even though I've always known about the account and alway let it go after she said no. She used to say it's for her retirement and I completely respected that.\n\nShe's been dating Dave for about 5 years now. And recently Dave got in trouble with the law and needed bail money. *A lot* of money. 6 figures. And my mom paid it. Not only that but she's going to pay for his lawyer. All from he saving account. When I heard this I got upset because what in the flying fuck? She didn't even consider helping me out but didn't waste a second hopping to the bank for her troublesome boyfriend.

Tell her she should have just worked harder and she'll need to get a job if she needs money that badly.", "NTA. I firmly believe that when you have a child, you are financially tied to that person for life, not just until the turn 18. It would be one thing if your mom was actually saving that money for retirement, but she\u2019s made it clear that she wasn\u2019t, she was saving it for some deadbeat loser who (allegedly) did something so awful his bail was in the six figures. \n\nYou\u2019re not entitled for asking for help from your mom. Your mom is TA for repeatedly refusing to help her child with very reasonable expenses and then turning around and throwing it away for some guy. \n\nMight be time to distance yourself from this person who has failed you time and again and clearly does not have your best interests at heart. You\u2019ll probably hear from her again when she needs money for a nursing home, and then it\u2019ll be your turn to tell her she should have worked harder and she sounds entitled.", "NTA of course not. She\u2019s a shitty mom and you should tell her don\u2019t ever ask you for money", "NTA. Sure, it's her money, she can spend it how she wants. If how she wants to spend it is dropping well over a hundred thousand fucking dollars on bailing her boyfriend of 5 years out of prison, but can't be bothered with, what, $5k? Less? For moving/1st month expenses for her own child so they can be successful in their career?\n\nYeah I'd say that's some shitty mothering, you're calling it like you see it.", "No, you are NTA.  \n\nYour mother is a huge one though. I totally understand saving for retirement. That makes sense. Spending money on a deadbeat bf for his bail and attorney?  No, that's what makes her a huge assh\\*\\*e. \n\nOP, you sound smart and capable. Your mother has issues (apparently) by putting her terrible bf ahead of her daughter/daughter's education.  I'm speechless.", "My advice is, if you are the kind of person who wants to work through a stable career, then it's easily worthwhile to take a loan for the career qualification. You'll earn it back and more but only if it paves the way into a career which exists and which you're willing to plod. Good luck. \n\nYour mom is a human who struggles to hold together her various needs. Maybe she could do better but keep in mind that you don't know everything about her situation. NAH.", "NTA.

It is true that it is her money and she is entitled to do with it what she wants, but wasting it instead of using it as an opportunity to help her child is such a shame.\n\nWith the way this boyfriend of hers is spending her money, she is going to need your financial support sooner or later.  Keep in mind her actions when you decide what to do.", "NTA part of being a parent, especially in this day and age with rising costs, is helping your kid. it\u2019s not like you demanded money from her as your due. you asked your parent for help AND had a plan and repayment schedule. instead of help her own child, she\u2019s blowing all her money to help her criminal boyfriend. you have every right to be upset with her for this and every right to call her out on it. she *is* unsupportive as a mom. i\u2019m really sorry, op.", "NTA. \n\nAs hard as it was, you know how to survive on your own. You're very mature, more so than your mother. A the end of the day, as you stated, it's her money. Your mom is going to blow her life savings on this dope. Then one day, once you're on your feet and living a financially secure life, she'll knock on your door begging for help. \n\nSit her down calmly, apologize if you approached her aggressively in the heat of the moment. She probably knows she's wrong and is trying to convince herself this is \"different.\" After you tell her why you're so hurt, remind her of the times she could of used that money to invest in your future, but is now gambling on BF's issues and a bleak looking future. Remind her people get old, and eventually need help. Ask her if she thinks this guy is worth it and if he would do the same, even though it's safe to say- no. If she thinks he's worth it, fine. She's an adult. Tell her you love her and continue thriving. \n\nBut without a doubt, the tables will turn, and one day you will have the opportunity to tell her that your money is for your future/family to ensure they will not have to give up dreams that you once had to, because you were financially on your own.", "NTA for being upset.  \nBut, your mother's money is hers.

I don't know anything about Dave but needing that much money for bail cannot be a good thing. These kind of relationships can put a strain on child/parental bonds.", "I'm going to go with ESH...but hear me out. Her refusal to help you doesn't make her a shitty mom by itself and we don't have any other context showing that she is. It's her money and she is entitled to use it as she sees fit. Plus, she taught you some valuable lessons by forcing you to figure things out.\n\nOn the other hand... spending thousands on someone's bail money was not the best idea she could have come up with. Especially if she plans on retiring on that money. It could lead to you having to take care of her in retirement. But then it will be *your* money to spend as *you* see fit.

OP realized at that moment that her mothers BF is more worthy of her funds than she is. \n\nWhy don't you ask OP what BF is in trouble for? Petty crimes do not garner 6 digit bails, i can tell you that much. The BF is terrible for the family if he's guilty of a crime.

So a rejection means you had no credit or bad credit. If you had no credit, that sucks but it's kinda on you that you didn't cultivate any credit throughout college while working 2 jobs - unless you didn't know about credit at all? If you had bad credit then that might explain why your mother was so reluctant to loan you the money.\n\nSo which was it?", "The one where my deadbeat father stole my identity and fucks up my credit which I had to use my savings and more to sort out.

Just say yta and move on. \n\nAnd I'm not entitled to her money. Nor do I feel so. I make my own money. It just sucks to see what she finds important and not important.
