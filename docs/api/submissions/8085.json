You\u2019re both young and in a very complicated situation. I can totally understand why you wouldn\u2019t feel the need to know someone that you don\u2019t feel any connection to. It\u2019s different than growing up in a house with a sibling. On the other hand, I don\u2019t blame Jane for wanting a relationship with you. The poor girls mom was cheated on by your shared biological father. I can understand why she would try to see the little bit of positive that at least she gets a sister out of it. \n\nHave you talked to your mom and dad about it? I definitley don\u2019t think you have to have a relationship with anyone you don\u2019t want to, but maybe they can help you find a kinder way to explain it to Jane and close the book on that issue.", "Nta but.... look kid, being mean to her and not explaining why is most likely going to get her to explain to her friends what's going on.  This whole story will be all around your school soon and you are going to have to come to terms with that.  \n\nExpect it to happen.  Start coping with it.  That's life in high school.", "Nta \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be friends or sisters with her. But you do have to be polite. If she is harassing you at school report it to the school. You don\u2019t want a familiar connection with her that is your right. \n\nSharing dna doesn\u2019t mean people have to be friends nor talk to each other.", "You don't get suspended for telling someone to 'screw off'. There's more to this story.", "NTA why are you suspended? You could have been more polite, but if you don't want to associate with her that's your right and given circumstances understandable. But remember the circumstances are not her fault.", "NTA, you don't have to have a relationship if you don't want one. It should by your choice and not that of your parents though. If you don't want one and she continues to harass you, report it.", "NTA\n\nYou are not required to have a relationship with someone just because you share DNA. You are allowed to have boundaries with people for whatever reason you choose.  You tried telling Jane that you didn't want a relationship with her nicely, and she ignored you and continued to try crossing your boundaries. When that didn't work, you were a bit harsher. That is how boundary enforcement works. And people getting mad when someone is \"mean\" for sticking to their boundaries are the people that enable toxic, boundary stomping behavior.", "NTA- you get to choose who you have a relationship with. You get to choose who you treat as family and who you don\u2019t. I will say, you probably could\u2019ve been nicer, but there\u2019s a point where being nice isn\u2019t getting the message across, and you have to be firm or down right mean to get people to listen. It\u2019s sucks that you two were born into this shitty situation, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be in each others lives. Your half sister should respect what you want and leave you alone. \n\nTell your parents you need more support from them in this, especially if the schools getting involved and suspending you.

Your biological dad had an affair. Those things are facts. The past isn't going to go away, just because they want to brush the facts of your *literal existence* under the rug.   \n\n\nIf anything, I would expect your half-sister to not want a relationship with *you*, because it paints her father in a much worse light than your mother, just from this third-party perspective, but she *wants* a relationship with you. Even though you clearly don't like her, nothing you've said about her has made her seem unpleasant. Not everyone understands \"letting down gently\", especially if you frame it like \"oh, no, maybe some other time\" or \"I'm not interested right now, maybe later.\" We have no information on how you \"let her down gently\".  \n\n\nBased on your post, I would go N-T-A but caution you to avoid burning bridges...however, based on your comments, YTA.

I empathize for everyone involved right now. Just remember, Jane didn't create this anymore than you did. I am not saying you have to be \"sisters\" or even friends, but try to allow for some grace to her. It sounds like you're both handling it very differently and have different perspectives, but ultimately BOTH of you are in a challenging situation to navigate because of adult decisions made very long ago. I think you should be in therapy to work through the best way to cope with this. I sincerely do not mean that as an insult. Plenty of adults need therapy to help cope with complicated family dynamics too. This is very important... It is not your responsibility to protect your adult parents from the adult decisions they made 16 years ago.", "My opinion is probably unpopular.

Did you know your biological half sister in person before she moved to live with your biological father.\n2. If you did how often have you seen each other in the past\n3. If not how long has she been in your life at this point\n4. Do you have a relationship with your biological father or is he just your sperm donor.\n5. If so does he have visitation\n6. Does he pay child support\n7. Who is listed as  the father on your Birth certificate", "Nta your allowed to want space. But consider therapy you maybe have unresolved anger", "NTA since she didn't listen the first few times. She should get the picture to leave you alone. \n\nAlso the number of people forcing titles on these people for you \"because blood\" and because \"legal\" is asinine to me. YOU decide who your family is and no amount of blood will dictate that for you. This girl might \"technically\" be your half sister, but you don't really know or have a relationship with her, so you don't have to claim her as such. And you don't have to play happy families with her if you don't want to. \n\nIt's fully insulting when people do that. Half of my family isn't blood related to me. And I have blood relations I don't claim. Good for you, OP, sticking to your guns and your boundaries. Focus on the people who love you and the people you have claimed. But maybe see if someone can have a talk with this girl to get her to leave you alone, and to teach her what \"no\" means. \n\nTake care of yourself, OP.", "I'm not gonna give a verdict, but I will give you some advice. Not gonna lie, you handled it cruely, but when people are so insistent, being nice tends to go right out the window. I have step siblings (step-mom's kids) that have tried to tell me that I only have one dad and I have had to break it to them that while they were right, the man I consider my dad and the grandfather to my son is the man that finally adopted me when I turned 21. Politely explain to her that while you understand you share a biological father, you are not at the point of wanting to know him or her and that the man that raised you is the man that you consider your dad. I would also mention to her that while you will be civil, if she continues to be insistent, it will only make matters worse and push you away. After that, talk to an administrator at your school. You don't have to give them all the gorey details, just apologize for your outburst and explain that it only came about because she constantly harassed/stalked you and you got to a breaking point. If you feel comfortable enough to inform of the dna you share, then explain that while you acknowledge the DNA, you don't appreciate her hounding you, stalking you, and making you feel stressed over the situation. Work with the school administrators to come up with a way to keep you apart as much as possible.", "I'm going soft YTA. You are so angry and it's not okay. You need to talk to a therapist. Not your mom, not your half sister, not your dad, and not the internet. You are fighting really hard to protect your mom's reputation, but she made those choices she can live with them. A bad decision doesn't mean your mom is a bad person, and it doesn't change your relationship with her. \nStop taking all the things you've been raised not to acknowledge out on someone else", "You are so young, I hope your parents and you go to family therapy.", "NTA\n\nIf this is a true story and you have been suspended for not wanting a relationship with someone who while you share DNA with you don't have a relationship with and  for asking her to stop harassing you and stalking you need to go through the complaints procedure. \n\nSpeak to your parents and take this further. It is not appropriate for school to force you to put up with this.", "NTA, you have told her calmly many times, and she didn't respect that. Your \"Dad\" hasn't reached out at all, so why should you consider this relationship.\nBut you should consider her feelings as well, she's new, she was excited to meet you, especially sfter her father mentioned you so many times. Maybe you need go be more patient with her. But you have no obligation to be sisterly to her.", "I think you need to talk to your mom and a therapist about this.  Her parents split but yours stayed together so you two see the affair differently. She maybe wants more siblings and your parents probably want to forget it and move on.  It\u2019s definitely awkward but she\u2019s here now so you need to set boundaries", "None of this is true is it\n\nYou're suspended? For making your sister cry.  Doubt it.", "NTA. I\u2019ve read your comments that you tried to explain it nicely to her and I don\u2019t get how people can call you an a-hole. It\u2019s completely valid that you don\u2019t want a relationship with her. \nMaybe that will change in the future or not, for now you made your decision and she should accept it.", "NTA. But..Why on earth did you get suspended for saying that.. that's what I'm wondering. Weird school.", "NAH. It's a shit situation for both of you.\n\nBy my assumptions she's either too young to know or just doesn't know about the situation. She's probably been sold this fairytale of you both being sisters.\n\nUnfortunately it may not get better until she is older and/ or knows the truth.", "Sweetheart I don\u2019t think that AITA is helping you. You don\u2019t need judgement when the school has already judged you recently. I know that it shouldn\u2019t be down to you in year 10 but is this the right school? What do you think?", "So, I\u2019m not going to give you a judgement because you are a 15 year old in a really tough and messy situation. But, I\u2019m going to put in my two cents on the situation because you put it out in the world. \n\nHow long have you known that you aren\u2019t biologically related to your dad?  I ask, because it seems like you\u2019ve known for a while because one of your comments mentioned that your bio-dad had reached out before and neither your mother nor you want you to have a relationship with him. How long has he been reaching out and wanting a relationship with you? I ask because it seems like your parroting words and anger you hear from adults in your life about this situation. This is not an attack on your mom nor your dad- but there seems to be a chance that one or both of them kept you from your bio dad to make it easier to move on from the affair.  \n\nIt seems like up until now you could all easily ignore any attempts from bio dad or bio-half sister at a relationship, but now with her at your school it\u2019s a lot harder. While she should have backed off the first time you told her to, let\u2019s exercise our empathy and realize this is a hard situation for her. I\u2019m not saying to do this because you owe her due to blood, but because it\u2019s a good personality trait in general to be able to have empathy for others. \n\nYou need to see a family counselor. This is a lot for you to try and deal with on your own, and you need a non-biased adult to help with this situation. There will be uncomfortable feelings that come up and you might have to face some uncomfortable facts, but you will be so much better for it on the other side. You have so much anger about this situation that you\u2019ve maybe been internalizing your anger for a long time, and now you\u2019re taking it out on someone who is truly innocent in all of this because she reminds you that your mom has made mistakes and isn\u2019t perfect.", "Nta I do think you should have spoken to your mom about it but you had gently let her down several  times before you blew up so it's kinda understandable  that u got angry", "NTA. You don't consider Jane to be your sister; and that's your prerogative to do so. Since she won't/can't take \"no\" for an answer, you probably should get your own parents involved in this. At the very least, you should not be suspended from school for something that is, at the end of the day, a private matter.", "NTA.  You are related, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to have a relationship or acknowledge the lineage.  What you do have to do is ask your parents to contact her dad to get her counseling and to get her to go NC with you.  I also find it odd that her dad choose your school system to move to, so I\u2019m not sure I would expect much help from him.  You should, with your parents and school counselor formulate a plan that doesn\u2019t require her dad\u2019s participation.", "NTA - you are so angry and it\u2019s understandable.  A bunch of adults made a mess and now two teens have to deal with and navigate it.  \n\nYour mom and dad need to step in and help you.  You can\u2019t change the past and you can\u2019t hide what exists.  Maybe you can reach out directly to bio dad and say \u201cI do not want a relationship with you or your daughter.  I\u2019ve tried to communicate this as directly and kindly as possible but she is not respecting my boundaries and I feel harassed.  Please communicate with her that I do not want to engage at all with her and let me finish my teen years and school in peace.

Blowing up at her wasn't good either, but I think you need to talk to your parents, and perhaps the school as well (they suspended you for that?)\n\nShe needs to understand that this is painful for your family and you do not want a family relationship with her, and she needs to stop harassing you.", "NTA  \n\n\nDo not let ANYONE force you to consider a blood connection as having meaning other than genetics.  \n\n\nThe reason people started the \"it's family\" nonsense was because they all lived and died in ten  miles of each other while using the woods as a toilet.

You have nicely told her you are not multiple times and even had your mother talk to her father about it and he blew it off.

Obviously being gentle didn't go through to her. \n\nYou don't have to have a friendship, let alone a sisterly relationship, if you don't want to. Just make sure to not bully or antagonize her. From what it sounds like, you just want nothing to do with her and you have the right to be left alone. \n\nAlso, its not like she's a little kid where you might have to be gentler. She's only a year younger which makes her your peer.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to avoid problems, just ignore her. Avoid getting angry, stay friendly.

I think a lot of the commenters are forgetting that this is two teenage girls here. OP, you don\u2019t have to accommodate Jane\u2019a desire for a sibling relationship but I suggest you stop worrying about people finding out about your mom\u2019s infidelity. It\u2019s nice that you want to preserve her and your (adopted) dad\u2019s reputations, but it\u2019s likely to become public knowledge anyway now that Jane is in your school.

It sounds like you don't even want to acknowledge who your biological father is and want to pretend it's not a part of your life. It sounds like you really want to just have a happy family with you, your mom and your dad. By acknowledging Jane, it's acknowledging the affair and having to really face the reality that your family situation is more complicated than any kid should have to deal with.\n\nI empathize, for sure. You're just a kid who shouldn't have to face the consequences of your mother's actions in this way. I get that, in your mind, if you accept Jane as your sister, that reality will have to set in and you don't seem to want that to happen. \n\nUnfortunately, things ARE complicated. Unfortunately, your mom and biological father put you AND Jane (and their significant others) in a difficult situation. It's unfair, but that's what it is. I think you're angry...but you're angry at the wrong person. Jane isn't the major problem here but I don't think you're ready to accept that your mom is part of the cause of all of this happening. Sorry, but she DID cheat and it WAS wrong and it's not going to go away, no matter how much you close your eyes and wish for it to. \n\nWho knows what Jane has been told by her parents, as well. Both of you are just kids put into a shitty situation. Both of you are living in different realities; for you, it's where the affair never happened and that you don't want to even have it affect your life. For Jane, it's where it's probably a blended family situation, where you can all be a happy family. Both aren't necessarily feasible. It IS affecting your life and it is NOT a happy family situation. \n\nJane may not even know the whole story; hell, you may not even know the whole story. So, depending on what Jane was told, I can't get mad at her for her reaction, even if she should back off. But I also think your anger needs to be redirected because Jane isn't the issue you have. She's just the easiest person to take it out on since you don't want to take it out on the person in your life who you are close to.\n\nIf you haven't gone to therapy with your parents, I actually think you should. It might be beneficial to work through these feelings. And Jane SHOULD back off, but that's something your mom will have to talk to her dad about.\n\nOverall, I'm saying a soft ESH because I get your anger and I get Jane not backing off (she should stop when she's told to), but the anger seems misplaced.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Theres no reason to keep it a secret that she's your half-sibling. \n\nI get you're in a tough spot and no adults that are responsible for this are really dealing with the issue and then you have someone you don't really know bugging you, but you're just adding more stress in your life by denying and hiding she's a half-sibling.", "Are you mad at her or are you just mad that she\u2019s a sign of what your mom might truly be\u2026\u2026must be hard having to cover for your parents mistakes\u2026", "So you're rude to a girl who is related to you and who had no choice in how she was conceived because you don't want people to know the truth about your mom?

You don\u2019t have to be fucking sisters but you can at least act like a human, it\u2019s not like she has done anything wrong. Your mom cheated?  This girl\u2019s very existence is your mom\u2019s fault.  Trying to look out for your mom\u2019s reputation at the expense of a whole ass person definitely makes you the asshole.", "If her dad is rich doesn't that mean your dad is rich. He's your bio dad right? Not saying you should have a realtionship with either your choice. But I'd advise you on getting him to pay child support. Depending on your state he could be paying you while you go to college. That's money in the bank.", "Yeah i don't get the people trying to force her to be nice to Jane. She doesn't want to deal with Jane. She's not outright mean or bullying she just wants to be left alone.", "this sounds similar to the gossip girl reboot premise\u2026", "OP is 15 but did something harsh enough to be suspended, like I went to suspend-happy schools and none of them would have suspended someone just for saying \"screw off, we aren't sisters.\" Gotta wonder why she got suspended tbh.", " \n\nI understand that no matter what and this young woman is being used by her father, it sucks around", "I said her comments are awful, not her. And it hasn\u2019t been 100 times, the girl joined the same school mere weeks ago according to OP. And OP freaked out at school bad enough to get suspended.

Every single one.", "Except for the one time she did?", "Your existence notwithstanding", "don\u2019t get why people down voted this comment. personally i agree somewhere with nah/ light yta but that doesn\u2019t mean anyone gets to disrespect your family. you wouldn\u2019t see anybody calling him your step dad or dad in quotes or anything besides just you dad if you were adopted or something .", "[deleted]", "\r  \n\r  \nYup It sounds like she won't leave OP alone\r  \n\r  \n*Since she learned who I am, she just won't leave me alone.

Biologically she is your half sister but because you were raised by your mothers husband, it\u2019s hard to see her as your half sister. Frankly I would be fuming.

Tell her to leave you alone or that you'll look into getting a restraining order.", "why because she doesn't like being stalked and harassed? Because that is basically what it amounts to. She has said no..she has said she isn't interested that should be the end of it.", "I\u2019m going to go with not enough info on the dad then. IMO we have no way of knowing what he did or didn\u2019t do, how hard he fought, if mom and her husband had way more money for a lawyer, if he was trying to save his own marriage and be there for his other kid, etc. I\u2019m not saying she should just be like \u201cyea bio dad we\u2019re best friends now!\u201d but without more context I think she\u2019s being harsh to her bio dad", "The sister is being a \"Nice Guy\" OP has repeatedly asked her to leave her alone and she will not.

So I need clarification because none of this logically makes sense.", "Telling someone to screw off is rude and you obviously said more to her than you\u2019re sharing, sorry but you\u2019re too young to see it now.

And she should respect your boundaries. No one can force another person into a relationship: not a boyfriend/girlfriend, not a stepparent, not a sibling.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Except you clearly are, your aggression to this other girl is unreal. You're trying to control her life because you're so terrified someone will find out.", "You're blaming a girl that had nothing to do with it, and you're blaming your bio dad.  Are you positive he wasn't around because your mom told/forced him not to be around?", "You\u2019re very mean person OP your mom is the reason why that girl is growing up in a broken home it is your mother fault if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault", "that's really unfortunate and I can see why you would get fed up. I think the majority of these comments are judging you pretty harshly, you're justifiably angry. someone else's comment about talking to a therapist is right, maybe they would have some tactics to firmly deny your half sisters desire for a relationship without getting you in trouble again. good luck and I hope you guys can get a peaceful resolution", "I think you have to have your mom talk to your counselor if your biological father is refusing to do anything...also have your father (not bio father) talk to the counselor.\n\nAnd I'm sorry people are being so mean on here...you're a kid and while you may not have handled it in the best way, I do think your reaction was understandable. Many people, on here, however, don't really get that sometimes bio relationships aren't wanted.  That said, I do think the real villain here is your bio father for not listening to your mother, not respecting your boundaries, and even enrolling his kid in your school without reaching out first to your mother and father.\n\nIf you have a friend you can trust, you might talk to them and see if they can run interference for you. I'd also talk to a counselor. And if worst comes to worst and kids start shit talking you, remember that high school in short term and no one will give a shit about this when you are in college. And if kids make fun of you, turn it around and stick the knife back in them...say something like 'ew, why are you concerned with my mom's former sex life, do you have mommy issues' or something like that. Basically, never let them see that it hurts or affects you...then they will (usually) move on and it will be old news.", "OP, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but this might bring up bouts of bad times for your parents and your family.\n\nYour mom screwed up big time (she did cheat, don\u2019t minimize it) and you are the product of it. Doesn\u2019t make you less of a person or a worse person because of what she did though. \n\nYour dad loves you and overcame it. But having your half sister come back means that they both have to face the consequences yet again of your mothers actions. These are not on you, and even being the best daughter right now might not fix it. Their happiness is not on you and you can be pissed off of the situation you currently are in. \n\nYou seem to have pushed off any type of relationship with your bio dad and half sister so you don\u2019t hurt your dad. I can see the anger, the hurt and the confusion you are going through right now. It\u2019s a lot at 15 and you are attacking the one that is causing all of this in your mind. Maybe you need to reevaluate what\u2019s really going on. Are you really angry at your bio dad and your half sister for being there? Or are you just mad of the possible ramifications of their presence in your life and the crap that comes with them? \n\nI would suggest sitting with your dad and telling him how much you love him. Then talk with your mom and see how this is affecting you. Let her call your bio dad and address the situation at hand. Talk to your half sister and say that what she\u2019s doing is not helping if ever you do want a relationship. Get the adults to figure it out, it\u2019s their problem not yours right now. Also, relax and calm down, you\u2019ve done everything right. You aren\u2019t a bad daughter if this situation is pissing you off, you are living it. You can\u2019t protect your mom, she\u2019s the adult she should be protecting you, not the other way around.\n\nSorry for this long text, but I\u2019ve got a daughter your age. It would break my heart if she would always feel the need to protect me, since that\u2019s my job.", "You're clearly not happy OP, and I truly don't believe this is what you want. You talk about how your family is normal, but it's not. And I think that's why you're so upset. It's not a normal family unfortunately, and pretending that everything is fine when it clearly isn't is only going to make things worse for you later on in life. Seriously, consider talking to your parents about therapy as an option. There's so much built up anger that's coming out in these comments and it's not healthy.", "I\u2019m not a therapist, but I have a teenager who is not mine (loooong story), but I feel like there are some similar enough emotions here. You don\u2019t seem happy. You seem like someone who has a facade of happiness that you are trying desperately to keep from cracking. I feel like you need to face that sooner than later or it\u2019s going to burst like a dam one day. You really need to talk to a pro about this ASAP. At minimum your guidance counselor if not a true therapist. They can absolutely help you", "You sure your mom is happy? She still getting enough play on the side? Your \"dad\" has no game lol", "I think you may be catastrophizing a bit though.  In this day and age a lot of people come from non-traditional homes.  Your dad is still your dad, even if biologically he isn't. Also, it isn't anyone's business the circumstances of how you have a half sister.  Even married people DO sometimes seperate for awhile and things may happen. Unless you are in an extremely religious or prudish community, I highly doubt people will care as much as you are thinking they will.", "I'm just going to say hang in there.  Breathe.  Rise above.  Protect the ones you love with your actions, not harsh words.", "It\u2019s also HER family\u2019s business too, she can tell her story if she wants to about how her parents broke up because her dad cheated with your mum. You\u2019re so concerned about people finding out that you\u2019ve likely made it more of a possibility by making such a big deal out of it. If you\u2019re gonna scream at and reject this girl who\u2019s just trying to be nice, what\u2019s stopping her from telling everyone?", "your dad *is* the man that raised you, i\u2019m not saying that \u201cyour real dad\u201d is this absentee jackass. rather i\u2019m only pointing out that i think you\u2019re expecting a very extreme or disproportionate response to something that happened fifteen years ago when the issue here involves making your bio HS a social pariah or come across as crazy when she\u2019s not to others. it\u2019s no one\u2019s business what the details are beyond \u201cwe\u2019re half sisters but don\u2019t have a relationship\u201d if it comes up and that\u2019s that.", "She is nothing to my mom or to my dad. Who is she to go out and reveal we're related because my mom cheated? That's not her family. That's my life. My family is not an open book. It's can be a dirty little secret and maybe it's not a dirty little secret but it doesn't matter because it's nobody's business but mine."]}
