You\u2019re both young and in a very complicated situation. I can totally understand why you wouldn\u2019t feel the need to know someone that you don\u2019t feel any connection to. It\u2019s different than growing up in a house with a sibling. On the other hand, I don\u2019t blame Jane for wanting a relationship with you. The poor girls mom was cheated on by your shared biological father. I can understand why she would try to see the little bit of positive that at least she gets a sister out of it. \n\nHave you talked to your mom and dad about it? I definitley don\u2019t think you have to have a relationship with anyone you don\u2019t want to, but maybe they can help you find a kinder way to explain it to Jane and close the book on that issue.", "Nta but.... look kid, being mean to her and not explaining why is most likely going to get her to explain to her friends what's going on.  This whole story will be all around your school soon and you are going to have to come to terms with that.  \n\nExpect it to happen.  Start coping with it.  That's life in high school.", "Nta \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be friends or sisters with her. But you do have to be polite. If she is harassing you at school report it to the school. You don\u2019t want a familiar connection with her that is your right. \n\nSharing dna doesn\u2019t mean people have to be friends nor talk to each other.", "You don't get suspended for telling someone to 'screw off'. There's more to this story.", "NTA why are you suspended? You could have been more polite, but if you don't want to associate with her that's your right and given circumstances understandable. But remember the circumstances are not her fault.", "NTA, you don't have to have a relationship if you don't want one. It should by your choice and not that of your parents though. If you don't want one and she continues to harass you, report it.", "NTA\n\nYou are not required to have a relationship with someone just because you share DNA. You are allowed to have boundaries with people for whatever reason you choose.  You tried telling Jane that you didn't want a relationship with her nicely, and she ignored you and continued to try crossing your boundaries. When that didn't work, you were a bit harsher. That is how boundary enforcement works. And people getting mad when someone is \"mean\" for sticking to their boundaries are the people that enable toxic, boundary stomping behavior.", "NTA- you get to choose who you have a relationship with. You get to choose who you treat as family and who you don\u2019t. I will say, you probably could\u2019ve been nicer, but there\u2019s a point where being nice isn\u2019t getting the message across, and you have to be firm or down right mean to get people to listen. It\u2019s sucks that you two were born into this shitty situation, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be in each others lives. Your half sister should respect what you want and leave you alone. \n\nTell your parents you need more support from them in this, especially if the schools getting involved and suspending you.

Your biological dad had an affair. Those things are facts. The past isn't going to go away, just because they want to brush the facts of your *literal existence* under the rug.   \n\n\nIf anything, I would expect your half-sister to not want a relationship with *you*, because it paints her father in a much worse light than your mother, just from this third-party perspective, but she *wants* a relationship with you. Even though you clearly don't like her, nothing you've said about her has made her seem unpleasant. Not everyone understands \"letting down gently\", especially if you frame it like \"oh, no, maybe some other time\" or \"I'm not interested right now, maybe later.\" We have no information on how you \"let her down gently\".  \n\n\nBased on your post, I would go N-T-A but caution you to avoid burning bridges...however, based on your comments, YTA.

I empathize for everyone involved right now. Just remember, Jane didn't create this anymore than you did. I am not saying you have to be \"sisters\" or even friends, but try to allow for some grace to her. It sounds like you're both handling it very differently and have different perspectives, but ultimately BOTH of you are in a challenging situation to navigate because of adult decisions made very long ago. I think you should be in therapy to work through the best way to cope with this. I sincerely do not mean that as an insult. Plenty of adults need therapy to help cope with complicated family dynamics too. This is very important... It is not your responsibility to protect your adult parents from the adult decisions they made 16 years ago.", "My opinion is probably unpopular.

Did you know your biological half sister in person before she moved to live with your biological father.\n2. If you did how often have you seen each other in the past\n3. If not how long has she been in your life at this point\n4. Do you have a relationship with your biological father or is he just your sperm donor.\n5. If so does he have visitation\n6. Does he pay child support\n7. Who is listed as  the father on your Birth certificate", "Nta your allowed to want space. But consider therapy you maybe have unresolved anger", "NTA since she didn't listen the first few times. She should get the picture to leave you alone. \n\nAlso the number of people forcing titles on these people for you \"because blood\" and because \"legal\" is asinine to me. YOU decide who your family is and no amount of blood will dictate that for you. This girl might \"technically\" be your half sister, but you don't really know or have a relationship with her, so you don't have to claim her as such. And you don't have to play happy families with her if you don't want to. \n\nIt's fully insulting when people do that. Half of my family isn't blood related to me. And I have blood relations I don't claim. Good for you, OP, sticking to your guns and your boundaries. Focus on the people who love you and the people you have claimed. But maybe see if someone can have a talk with this girl to get her to leave you alone, and to teach her what \"no\" means. \n\nTake care of yourself, OP.", "I'm not gonna give a verdict, but I will give you some advice. Not gonna lie, you handled it cruely, but when people are so insistent, being nice tends to go right out the window. I have step siblings (step-mom's kids) that have tried to tell me that I only have one dad and I have had to break it to them that while they were right, the man I consider my dad and the grandfather to my son is the man that finally adopted me when I turned 21. Politely explain to her that while you understand you share a biological father, you are not at the point of wanting to know him or her and that the man that raised you is the man that you consider your dad. I would also mention to her that while you will be civil, if she continues to be insistent, it will only make matters worse and push you away. After that, talk to an administrator at your school. You don't have to give them all the gorey details, just apologize for your outburst and explain that it only came about because she constantly harassed/stalked you and you got to a breaking point. If you feel comfortable enough to inform of the dna you share, then explain that while you acknowledge the DNA, you don't appreciate her hounding you, stalking you, and making you feel stressed over the situation. Work with the school administrators to come up with a way to keep you apart as much as possible.", "I'm going soft YTA. You are so angry and it's not okay. You need to talk to a therapist. Not your mom, not your half sister, not your dad, and not the internet. You are fighting really hard to protect your mom's reputation, but she made those choices she can live with them. A bad decision doesn't mean your mom is a bad person, and it doesn't change your relationship with her. \nStop taking all the things you've been raised not to acknowledge out on someone else", "You are so young, I hope your parents and you go to family therapy.", "NTA\n\nIf this is a true story and you have been suspended for not wanting a relationship with someone who while you share DNA with you don't have a relationship with and  for asking her to stop harassing you and stalking you need to go through the complaints procedure. \n\nSpeak to your parents and take this further. It is not appropriate for school to force you to put up with this.", "NTA, you have told her calmly many times, and she didn't respect that. Your \"Dad\" hasn't reached out at all, so why should you consider this relationship.\nBut you should consider her feelings as well, she's new, she was excited to meet you, especially sfter her father mentioned you so many times. Maybe you need go be more patient with her. But you have no obligation to be sisterly to her.", "I think you need to talk to your mom and a therapist about this.  Her parents split but yours stayed together so you two see the affair differently. She maybe wants more siblings and your parents probably want to forget it and move on.  It\u2019s definitely awkward but she\u2019s here now so you need to set boundaries", "None of this is true is it\n\nYou're suspended? For making your sister cry.  Doubt it.", "NTA. I\u2019ve read your comments that you tried to explain it nicely to her and I don\u2019t get how people can call you an a-hole. It\u2019s completely valid that you don\u2019t want a relationship with her. \nMaybe that will change in the future or not, for now you made your decision and she should accept it.", "NTA. But..Why on earth did you get suspended for saying that.. that's what I'm wondering. Weird school.", "NAH. It's a shit situation for both of you.\n\nBy my assumptions she's either too young to know or just doesn't know about the situation. She's probably been sold this fairytale of you both being sisters.\n\nUnfortunately it may not get better until she is older and/ or knows the truth.", "Sweetheart I don\u2019t think that AITA is helping you. You don\u2019t need judgement when the school has already judged you recently. I know that it shouldn\u2019t be down to you in year 10 but is this the right school? What do you think?", "So, I\u2019m not going to give you a judgement because you are a 15 year old in a really tough and messy situation. But, I\u2019m going to put in my two cents on the situation because you put it out in the world. \n\nHow long have you known that you aren\u2019t biologically related to your dad?  I ask, because it seems like you\u2019ve known for a while because one of your comments mentioned that your bio-dad had reached out before and neither your mother nor you want you to have a relationship with him. How long has he been reaching out and wanting a relationship with you? I ask because it seems like your parroting words and anger you hear from adults in your life about this situation. This is not an attack on your mom nor your dad- but there seems to be a chance that one or both of them kept you from your bio dad to make it easier to move on from the affair.  \n\nIt seems like up until now you could all easily ignore any attempts from bio dad or bio-half sister at a relationship, but now with her at your school it\u2019s a lot harder. While she should have backed off the first time you told her to, let\u2019s exercise our empathy and realize this is a hard situation for her. I\u2019m not saying to do this because you owe her due to blood, but because it\u2019s a good personality trait in general to be able to have empathy for others. \n\nYou need to see a family counselor. This is a lot for you to try and deal with on your own, and you need a non-biased adult to help with this situation. There will be uncomfortable feelings that come up and you might have to face some uncomfortable facts, but you will be so much better for it on the other side. You have so much anger about this situation that you\u2019ve maybe been internalizing your anger for a long time, and now you\u2019re taking it out on someone who is truly innocent in all of this because she reminds you that your mom has made mistakes and isn\u2019t perfect.", "Nta I do think you should have spoken to your mom about it but you had gently let her down several  times before you blew up so it's kinda understandable  that u got angry", "NTA. You don't consider Jane to be your sister; and that's your prerogative to do so. Since she won't/can't take \"no\" for an answer, you probably should get your own parents involved in this. At the very least, you should not be suspended from school for something that is, at the end of the day, a private matter.", "NTA.  You are related, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to have a relationship or acknowledge the lineage.  What you do have to do is ask your parents to contact her dad to get her counseling and to get her to go NC with you.  I also find it odd that her dad choose your school system to move to, so I\u2019m not sure I would expect much help from him.  You should, with your parents and school counselor formulate a plan that doesn\u2019t require her dad\u2019s participation.", "NTA - you are so angry and it\u2019s understandable.  A bunch of adults made a mess and now two teens have to deal with and navigate it.  \n\nYour mom and dad need to step in and help you.  You can\u2019t change the past and you can\u2019t hide what exists.  Maybe you can reach out directly to bio dad and say \u201cI do not want a relationship with you or your daughter.  I\u2019ve tried to communicate this as directly and kindly as possible but she is not respecting my boundaries and I feel harassed.  Please communicate with her that I do not want to engage at all with her and let me finish my teen years and school in peace.

Blowing up at her wasn't good either, but I think you need to talk to your parents, and perhaps the school as well (they suspended you for that?)\n\nShe needs to understand that this is painful for your family and you do not want a family relationship with her, and she needs to stop harassing you.", "NTA  \n\n\nDo not let ANYONE force you to consider a blood connection as having meaning other than genetics.  \n\n\nThe reason people started the \"it's family\" nonsense was because they all lived and died in ten  miles of each other while using the woods as a toilet.

You have nicely told her you are not multiple times and even had your mother talk to her father about it and he blew it off.

Obviously being gentle didn't go through to her. \n\nYou don't have to have a friendship, let alone a sisterly relationship, if you don't want to. Just make sure to not bully or antagonize her. From what it sounds like, you just want nothing to do with her and you have the right to be left alone. \n\nAlso, its not like she's a little kid where you might have to be gentler. She's only a year younger which makes her your peer.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to avoid problems, just ignore her. Avoid getting angry, stay friendly.

I would talk to your parents about her and her father if they don't already know.

I think a lot of the commenters are forgetting that this is two teenage girls here. OP, you don\u2019t have to accommodate Jane\u2019a desire for a sibling relationship but I suggest you stop worrying about people finding out about your mom\u2019s infidelity. It\u2019s nice that you want to preserve her and your (adopted) dad\u2019s reputations, but it\u2019s likely to become public knowledge anyway now that Jane is in your school.

It sounds like you don't even want to acknowledge who your biological father is and want to pretend it's not a part of your life. It sounds like you really want to just have a happy family with you, your mom and your dad. By acknowledging Jane, it's acknowledging the affair and having to really face the reality that your family situation is more complicated than any kid should have to deal with.\n\nI empathize, for sure. You're just a kid who shouldn't have to face the consequences of your mother's actions in this way. I get that, in your mind, if you accept Jane as your sister, that reality will have to set in and you don't seem to want that to happen. \n\nUnfortunately, things ARE complicated. Unfortunately, your mom and biological father put you AND Jane (and their significant others) in a difficult situation. It's unfair, but that's what it is. I think you're angry...but you're angry at the wrong person. Jane isn't the major problem here but I don't think you're ready to accept that your mom is part of the cause of all of this happening. Sorry, but she DID cheat and it WAS wrong and it's not going to go away, no matter how much you close your eyes and wish for it to. \n\nWho knows what Jane has been told by her parents, as well. Both of you are just kids put into a shitty situation. Both of you are living in different realities; for you, it's where the affair never happened and that you don't want to even have it affect your life. For Jane, it's where it's probably a blended family situation, where you can all be a happy family. Both aren't necessarily feasible. It IS affecting your life and it is NOT a happy family situation. \n\nJane may not even know the whole story; hell, you may not even know the whole story. So, depending on what Jane was told, I can't get mad at her for her reaction, even if she should back off. But I also think your anger needs to be redirected because Jane isn't the issue you have. She's just the easiest person to take it out on since you don't want to take it out on the person in your life who you are close to.\n\nIf you haven't gone to therapy with your parents, I actually think you should. It might be beneficial to work through these feelings. And Jane SHOULD back off, but that's something your mom will have to talk to her dad about.\n\nOverall, I'm saying a soft ESH because I get your anger and I get Jane not backing off (she should stop when she's told to), but the anger seems misplaced.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This girl\u2019s very existence is your mom\u2019s fault.  Trying to look out for your mom\u2019s reputation at the expense of a whole ass person definitely makes you the asshole.", "If her dad is rich doesn't that mean your dad is rich.

It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to start shit.\n\nThat seems like a very out of touch assumption. Parents typically both have say in which school their kids go to. Parents also typically send their kids to the best school they can (be it because of availability, districting, or financial reasons). A lot of areas also don\u2019t have high numbers of schools, or have so many student aged people that the numerous schools they do have are already past capacity. So if dad already vetted this school for the older daughter and realized it\u2019s a very good school along with being affordable and in their district, *of course* he would send his younger daughter to this good and affordable and close school as well. The parents all absolutely need to figure out a solution for the kids rather than leaving it to the kids to figure out, but your comment just comes across like you\u2019ve never had to figure out schooling for multiple children or that you\u2019ve always been in areas with above average schools available to choose from.\n\nEdit to add; I misread the original post and thought bio dad had been involved. That\u2019s genuinely my bad. However, the rest of it still stands. Not every school is the same quality, even within public districts. And not every district has more available spaces than students. Jumping to thinking someone has a mysterious ulterior motive in placing their kid in a school feels ignorant of all the vetting that goes into choosing a school.", "I never saw either version of it \ud83d\ude02", "Hah I wondered if anyone else realized it - you\u2019re right it sounds strangely similar\u2026", "But I am guessing the administration doesn\u2019t know the full details about the argument and what their connection is", "From the OP replies I suspect school don't actually know what is going on.

Maybe he regrets ignoring her and allowing her to be adopted, who knows. A lot can change about ppl in 16 years. But the adults in this story, especially biodad suck for letting things get this far. OP is 15 and this is her second year of high school where she is making friends and cementing relationships. She doesn't want a sister. She has told everyone she doesn't have a sister and now Jane is bringing it all back out through no fault of her own. OP doesn't want to explain to her friends that her half sister is the result of an affair. Its all nasty and the kids get the brunt of it.", "I remember at I think 19, I had this much older guy who wouldn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer and would keep asking me to hang out. At first, I was polite, made some obvious excuses, cut conversations short\u2026 but he would not take the hint!

Maybe, but she\u2019s 15 and her boundaries are being trounced by a literal stranger. If it wasn\u2019t her half-sister but a random male classmate trying to get her to hang out, no one would think twice about her being NTA.

Hardly something children should \"work out\" on their own. Especially with such extreme opposition.", "She doesn't want everyone knowing about how they became sisters.

He either gave up his parental rights or had them terminated. He would have to have done for her father to adopt OP.... Jane and OP share DNA with OP sperm donor...that does not make them siblings and OP has the right to say no to that relationship it's about consent.", "This!\n\nI understand to urge to do this - but you are 15 and it is not your responsibility what THEY did.", "So why are you so fucking mad?

It would have helped avoid the current situation you\u2019re in.\n\nLike I said in another comment, my husband raised a child his ex-wife had from an affair. She is about your age. She was not told as a child and as a result, is going through a real difficult time now. \n\nI believe you have a good relationship with your mom.

I know this because I heard the exact same line from my stepdaughter\u2019s mom. \n\nAnd like you, my stepdaughter has a lot of anger and hate towards her bio dad whom she barely met and never really did anything to her. In fact, *he is the one that had his daughter taken from him,* when she was born legally belonging to another man. **(In many countries a woman\u2019s husband is legally the father of any baby she gives birth to, and in many situations they can\u2019t get off the hook)**\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated situation. But being super angry at your dad and bio sister while giving your mom a pass is not fair. Sure she did everything for you.

You're not a 12-year old at the mercy of emotional outbursts, and I'm sure you understand that words have consequences since you're asking on here. There are many ways to communicate the essence of what you want to say (which is \"I'm not as into this sister thing as you are, who tf are you even\") but doing it in a kind and mature way.

You may have been mean about it (and may be TA in that sense but Jane also should not have kept pushing you), but in terms of the general situation, the whole thing sucks for both of you. Now the reason I'm commenting is so that you know the only thing you can control is whether or not you choose to have a relationship with her. What you can't control is whether or not she tells people her story. It's her story to tell, and she has the right to tell people who she is and what happened to her. She wouldn't be the AH for telling her story, even if it portrays your mom in a bad light. Affairs have consequences, and this might be one. I think you need to mentally prepare yourself for that. That said, if it happens, know it's not your fault, and also, people will get over it.\n\nMaybe in the future, you can give her a chance. That does not mean that you are betraying your dad or acknowledging Jane's father as meaning anything to you. But, she's probably the only person in this world who sort of understands your situation. Ultimately, it's your choice though. No one can (or should) force you to have a relationship with her.\n\nEdit: Took out the part about it may be sucking for Jane a little more. Your situation is complicated, and it can suck for both of you equally and differently. I do think you're more affected by what happened than you're admitting to yourself.

It's also reasonable for her half-sister to want to tell people who her sister is and how they are related", "But it is Jane's story too. Her parents were broken up by the affair that resulted in OP. Jane's life has been directly impacted in all ways.", "Fair.", "Jane is free to tell her friends that her parents got divorced because her dad had an affair. Telling other people OP\u2019s part of the story is where it crosses the line,", "You are so forgiving towards your mom (who cheated and broke up a relationship) but so aggressively cruel to this girl who did nothing. You want to protect YOUR mom?? You DO realize your mom is one of the people who hurt Jane??", "I agree - OP is 15 and dealing with a stressful situation, which the adults in her life seem to be handling badly. \n\nOP, how long have you known that your dad isn\u2019t your bio dad? You say that this knowledge hasn\u2019t changed your relationship with your dad, and you love your mom, but how has it really affected you? This is a lot to deal with! You had an idea of what your family is and now that Jane is in your life your whole notion of your family has gotten uprooted. I think your problem really is with how unsettled this situation has made you feel and that no one seems to be in your corner.\n\nBut also maybe look at things from Jane\u2019s perspective. Why has she come to live with her father after so long with her mother? Maybe something happened with her mom and Jane is just lost. She\u2019s trying to latch on to you because she seems to have little support herself. I\u2019m not saying you have to have a relationship with her, but perhaps if you can understand what her situation is it will help you come up with a better way to navigate this.\n\nNTA. Can\u2019t say the same for the adults in your life who have left you to deal with their mess yourself.", "You might be right, but OP doesn\u2019t have to accept her either. As you said they aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, but so is being a half sister and having to maintain a relationship. \n\nWe wouldn\u2019t expect an adult to have to accept her in her life, so why are we pushing it on a teen? Is it because they have a mutual parent and they can\u2019t have a say in how they feel?", "And OP has the right to say that she has no sisters since legally, she has no sisters. Jane's dad severed his parental relationship to OP, which means he is no longer OP's dad.", "At that age, everything seems like a catastrophe. I had some good times as a teenager, but I don't miss the drama. ;)", "This is all true. Jane has just as much reason to want to humiliate OP\u2019s mom as OP wants to protect her. The affair is the reason Jane\u2019s parents aren\u2019t together.\nI would go with NAH because both have understandable views and both are young. This is a lot to deal with. OP may be able to take measures to stop Jane from actually harassing her, but getting her not to talk about it is a very different matter.", "Nta get your mom to talk to admin to get the harassment stopped and suspension removed\nI consider jane to be stalkerish bullying \nAnd too bad you cant get a restraining order", "INFO: She is harassing you. Why are you suspended?", "NTA, how can you get suspended for that?", "how can the school suspend you because you told her off?  That seems rather excessive.  Are your parents contesting it?     \n\n\nI'm going to go with NAH.  She didn't realize you weren't interested in fostering a relationship with her, and you didn't know how else to subtly get her to understand.    \n\n\nDid she complain to the school authorities about you to get you suspended?  If she did, then she is the AH.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right not to engage with Jane. Jane considering you a sister does not make you a sister. You were raised separately, and you appear to consider another man your father.\n\nHonestly, while Jane may want a sisterly relationship, this cannot be forced. Trying to force it may make this worse. However, you do need to handle this better. When your suspension is up, reach out to the school authorities and explain that Jane is making you uncomfortable. You do not have ties to that part of your family and do not want to. Jane will not leave you alone and you are not ok with that. Ask for separate classrooms if possible because she is harassing you at this point.", "NTA you told her a few times to leave you alone and she refused to do that. From your perspective she is just a stranger who is suddenly invading your space and expecting you to see her as your family when the only relation you two have is the blood one. I imagine you are not very happy with her talking about her dad either nor about how he keeps talking about you. After all, you said you see your mom's husband as your father because he is the man who raised you and not your bio dad. She most likely did not have any ill intentions but she seems to not know how to take no as an answer nor did she consider how you feel about her dad considering she kept talking about him.", "Why were you suspended? For telling a stranger to stop harassing you?", "Yes boundaries getting violated over and over tends to evoke rage lol.", "If it\u2019s a US school you absolutely can. My HS had a zero tolerance policy so people who were bullied in instances that counted as \u201cfights\u201d also got suspended even if they didn\u2019t fight back. You could even get a day of suspension if you wracked up 3 dress code violations. There\u2019s absolutely no investigation into stuff like that at zero tolerance schools, either everyone is guilty and you can\u2019t fight it or they just decide who\u2019s at fault and pat themselves on the back for a \u201cjob well done\u201d lol", "Why is her behavior gross and her comments awful? She literally has her own desires, needs, and wants. Just because she doesn\u2019t want to be \u201csisters\u201d with someone who she only knows due to an affair? You go be friends with Jane then", "Are you serious? I read this whole thread looking for these awful comments you mentioned and don\u2019t find anything.", "You\u2019re gross.", "The adults are really something else, hey? I feel sorry for all the kids involved.", "Just because their parents fucked doesn't obligate OP to have a relationship with her.", "ok, that's how kids phrase things when they want to win someone over. my dad talks about you \"all the time\". it's highly likely she wants to have a relationship with her sister and *she* talks about her all the time and dad's just trying to participate.", "I figured it was some bs. NTA.\n\nI completely understand why you are hostile. You know you're lucky that your dad forgave your mom and stuck around and now this girl is harassing you to try to drag your bio dad into your life and screw up the good family you have. Makes total sense to me.", "Your vp is ridiculous!", "and people that express by telling someone off so bad they get suspended from school are generaly assholes", "Do school know about your and Jane's biological connection?", "But she did help ruin Jane's parents relationship? Why shouldn't Jane be allowed to tell people about what happened between her parents?", "\"I didn't grow up in a broken home.\" Oh, honey. Yes, you did. In fact, most families are somewhat broken. And that's okay! It's obvious the love is strong between the three of them. \n\nOP REALLY really needs some therapy. \n\nI'm probably gonna get thrown under the bus for saying this, but I wonder if she's suffering from only child \"syndrome\". She's very possessive...", "Perhaps, but that\u2019s her decision to make. We all get to decide who we want relationships with. If OP doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her half-sister then she doesn\u2019t have to have one. And she doesn\u2019t need to justify why.", "It's her choice though. No one should be forced to have a relationship with anyone else. It sucks and maybe OP is missing out but at the end of the days it's her choice. I'm sure Jane will make other friends and eventually move past this. Sounds like a hard situation for both but it's not OPs responsibility.", "Jfc this sub is full of insane people who don't actually interact with other human beings.\n\nYou're all awful.", "Absolutely this. How is everyone in this thread falling for it? She reeks unreliable narrator. Stank attitude, 15 or not.", "Lots of schools have zero tolerance policies, and yelling \"fuck off\" at a younger student would be enough.", "She can say she has a sister, but she shouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s OP. She can tell her story as she wants, but she doesn\u2019t get to bring OP into it. Her rights end where OPs begin. And if OP doesn\u2019t want her story aired that is her right.", "Not wanting anyone to know the truth is a weird family dynamic.   Your mom should be protecting you and not you protecting her.   It doesn\u2019t work that way.   She cheated and now those decisions have long term impacts.", "62 comments later we made it to the end.  Now you have a lot to say, time to say it to a professional.", "Bio dad has nothing to do with OP! He has only seen her a few times.", "But she didn't say \"fuck off\" per the post, she said screw off. One is considered a swear and the other is not generally", ">there's no need to tell everybody that both of your families got fucked up by the same affair.\n\nThere's no need, yes.\n\nBut also it's not Jane's responsibility to keep adults dirty secrets.\n\nShe is well within her rights to tell people:\n\n\"[OP] is my half sister, due to parental cheating. We weren't raised together and don't really have any family relationship, but I consider her family.\"\n\nLikewise, OP is well within her rights to be annoyed at Jane and not want a relationship with her.", "She may be beyond denial she is getting pretty angry\u2026..", "Family is more than blood. It\u2019s a shared history, caring about each other, and respecting each other. You can\u2019t force family as we\u2019ve seen on here time and time again. Letting this go is in Jane\u2018s best interest because she\u2019s never going to get the relationship she wants with OP.", "The whole situation seems to be incredibly uncomfortable for OP. She doesn't want a relationship with Jane, however if Jane keeps pushing her or talks to peers about this, their relation will soon spread and she has to explain to everyone that her mom cheated and whatsoever. I can understand why she simply doesn't want that. It's completely fine for Jane to want a relationship with her half sister, however OP doesn't owe her one. She doesn't want it and Jane has to respect that.", "I can see where you\u2019re coming from, but respecting people\u2019s boundaries is important.\nOP has set a clear boundary and Jane forcing her way through it is not the way.", "Agreed", "can we all keep in mind that we're talking about children here? not grown-ass adults.", "Her mom should have gotten her in therapy years ago so she would have been more mentally stable to handle all of this. \n\nJane may express love with gifts, is that a problem?", "Then your mom needs to contact the school and explain the situation. They should not allow her to continue to harass/stalk you.", "Can we all agree the mom and the dad are the assholes"]}
