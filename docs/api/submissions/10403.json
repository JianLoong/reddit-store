First, being a level 6 at age 8 means she is very good. It means she is an optional meaning she can create her own routines. Prior to that each level has to do the same floor routine. And while there is a lot I still dont understand after 10 years, I\u2019m wondering if you have EVER even watched her compete or you would at least understand that much?? After level 9, they are elite, like competitive in a national level. For context, my daughter is 15 and a level 7 and she started at age 4 and started competing at 7. And most girls in her level are teenagers. So yeah, for being so young. She\u2019s awesome. \nI agree though that it is concerning she doesn\u2019t even want to have a fun day and I understand you wanting her to have a normal childhood. In fact, I applaud that, because I\u2019ve seen parents take it too far, pushing their kids. \nBut if you take this to court and/ or make her quit you will ruin your relationship with your daughter. And as she gets older activities like this are going to help with self-esteem, depression, and keep her out of trouble. Think about when you were a kid: what was the ONE thing that really helped you when you were having a shit day, being picked on, did bad on a test, whatever that helped you to know you were worth something? \nAlso, stop complaining about her working out instead of spending time with you. Do you have any idea how many parents would love if their kid was active and worked hard like yours does? \nSo yeah, maybe go to her competition if you have not, and maybe just keep an eye on things . If you push it it won\u2019t go well with your ex, or your daughter. Time will tell and if things get worse maybe your ex will see what you see?", "YTA. My guess is that If she were a boy playing football or baseball and hoping for a college scholarship, you\u2019d view your child as a passionate, driven, and hard working athlete instead of viewing it as obsession or somewhat of a hobby. Leave her alone if you can\u2019t support her, but shame on you for not supporting her more.", "YWBTA\nYou're gonna COURT ORDER her to stop doing something she loves? Thats crazy. Your job as a parent is to teach balance to her. I did gymnastics when I was her age and I loved it.

She might achieve that. She may grow up and become a trainer FOR olympians. She may grow up and decide to be something else.

Yes, YWBTA for the action you are considering,but Y already TA for your attitude and treatment of your daughter.\n\nYou don't even know what a level 6 in gymnastics is. Neither do I, but I don't have a kid with an abiding passion either. If my kid was into a sport, you're damn right I would know what that term was because I would be taking her to competitions and classes and, yes, arranging time with her that wasn't sports-related, but that respected her schedule. \n\nYour child isn't your property and you have no right to take away something she loves because YOU don't like it. If she is too involved with something, work WITH your ex and stop casting her as the villain of the story. \n\nI'm sure your ex and Eve would appreciate you taking over some of the duties of conveying Eve to competitions and, if you live close enough, to classes and other events. You could be spending time with your daughter participating with her passion.  \n\nDon't bother if you're going to cut her down or belittle her interests, though.

After a couple of years, my brother and sister in law changed training gyms because they did not like the coaches, their attitudes towards the students and training methods.

As a parent you should want your kid to do something they enjoy and she enjoys it. The development in that sport will help many other sports in the future if she loses interest but I don't see a justification to forcibly stop something she loves. She could resent you for it. If she wants to try her hand at becoming an olympian you must let her try and fail/succeed, she needs to know it wasn't you that halted her dream. However, I feel bad about the fact that you're getting a super short end of the stick here in terms of being a father, this is completely bs. You need to figure out some way to negotiate more time you would be able to spend with her, also for example you can get her to teach you gymnastics.", "YTA.  Let her enjoy and love what she\u2019s doing.  If you force her to quit she will resent you, only making your relationship with her even more strained.", "YTA. This is something that your daughter loves and wants to do, and she's the one driving her involvement in gymnastics. Lots of kids that age are heavily involved in a sport. It sounds more like you're jealous of her gymnastics than you being concerned about her.  Moreover,  If you try to stop her from being involved in a sport she loves, she will resent you for the rest of her life, and for good reason.", "YTA Maybe you could work something out with your ex, so you can be part of her gymnastics. Watch a class or go to a competition. If it is about spending time with her this would be great.  Most young ones change their minds as they get older, she may too.

If this is something she has a huge interest in then walk alongside her, don't try and cut her off at the knees because it's something that you don't understand. \n\nAlso i will add that YTA for thinking that your daughter isn't Olympic material. Even if she isn't what sort of parent are you to think so lowly about your child?", "YTA.\n\nIf anything, your daughter is showing good judgement by avoiding the trampoline park. Its fine to want balance in her life, but balance at the cost of stealing something she loves is flat out cruel. Find another way - such as limiting her YouTube time for example.", "YTA It would make sense for a serious athlete to want to avoid getting injured just goofing around on a trampoline. Trampolines are actually pretty dangerous. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for parents of budding gymnasts to exercise caution, but, given that your daughter loves the sport, your reasons for wanting her to cut back seem selfish and petty. Your main complaints seems to be that she\u2019s not paying enough attention to you and showing enough interest in the things you think she should be interested in.\n\nYou should try to bond with your daughter by showing interest in HER interest.

Why don\u2019t you get more involved in gymnastics so you can bond over that and then also she will listen to you more if you suggest cutting back for a balanced life? Go to her meets, learn what the levels are and what they mean. When she is at your house stretch with her and watch videos with her. She obviously has a passion for gymnastics if she is doing stuff on her own so bond with her over what she loves, not what you want her to love.", "Oh hell!

I see both sides of this argument. \nMy daughter is now 13, started gymnastics and dance when she was 3, and trains between 15 and 30 hours a week. \n\nUnfortunately for her dad the majority of these hours are on his time with her. Which means he doesn't see her as often as he would like. \n\nHOWEVER, we asked him to get involved a little, attending a competition or two with us and watch her perform, meet the teachers etc. \n\nHe realises now dancing is her dream and her passion. He's still annoyed he doesn't see her as much as he would like but he doesn't take it out on her. \nGet involved and then see how you feel before making any rash decisions. Her dedication might surprise you!", "This is not going to be a popular opinion. \n\nNTA for wanting her to quit BC you truly think it's detrimental to her.  YWBTA if you just up and forced her to quit without any communication about your fears and concerns. \n\n So I'm coming from the mindset of someone who is married to a high performance coach. He wants all three of our kids to enter his sport (it is literally his life and passion). He will also not allow our kids to start training until he believes they are old enough (12 ish) This is bc he believes it is very easy for a child to be overworked and over trained. It leads to mental health issues and physical problems later in life and he has seen it over and over.  \n\nOur kids are involved in a variety of sports but none of them are hyper competitive. We make it clear the sports they do are for enjoyment and physical health. If they do compete there is no emphasis on winning but rather the experience for its own sake. I know this isn't everyone's mindset but it is the one we hold. \n\nI think you need to have a long hard talk with your ex and your daughter about next steps here.

That means she is not only able to do competition gymnastics, but, able to do competitions where she makes her own routines.\n\nWith some encouragement and support from her parents, she very likely could go on to be a level 10 gymnast.

And Eve's current situation means her shot at the Olympics is not totally unrealistic. So sit down about that one.\n\nIf you are concerned that Eve's connection with the sport is toxic, get more involved and find out what's going on. In fact, get more involved anyway. Do a few stretches with her. Watch some videos. If you can't follow her about gymnastics, talk to her about music. If the trampoline gym, and all the people in it being reckless on the equipment, scare her, step aside and play a few games of air hockey or skee ball - most trampoline gyms have that option.\n\nA thing to be aware of about your eight year-old is that she is clearly not a normal kid. Normal eight year-olds don't do 45 minutes of self-directed stretching. Because your daughter is not a normal kid, she is never going to have a normal childhood. She can have an AMAZING childhood, but it isn't going to be what you expected, just like Eve is probably not what you expected.\n\nI also want to speak to you as a divorced parent. I don't think kids are necessarily terribly harmed by divorce, but one thing I definitely noticed in my own kids is that divorce really made it clear to them that they don't control their own lives. They were pretty pissed at me about that for a while and I just kind of had to take it on the chin, because no way was I putting eight year-olds in charge. The children's desire for control led them to try acting out in some fairly startling ways to take control back. \n\nYou do not have a child who can be satisfied with coating the coffee measuring spoon with dish soap. Eve is a lot more driven than that.\n\nSo, if you want Eve to cut back on gymnastics (which is going to be a hard sell, and I would not rely on the courts to help with it), you need a substitute activity. Which, Eve being Eve, bless her, is going to get just as intense about. If you don't supply such an activity, and sell Eve on it, she will invent one. You may not like what she comes up with.\n\nIf you are concerned about balance, take Eve out to do something fun. Teach her to shoot pool or skip rocks or something that you can do with her. Clear a few weekends a year for time for the two of you, go to some meets when she's not in your custody. The more balanced you are about this, the easier it will be for Eve to also be balanced. Going to court to make her stop is not balanced.", ">the odds of her becoming an olympian are pretty low\n\nWay to turn something your daughter is apparently very good at into a failure.\n\nYTA.", "YTA!

She has dreamed of going to UCLA to be on their team and she had tunnel vision as a 7-8 yr old. She was so mature for her age, but I\u2019ve also realized - I let her do so much so fast which maybe led to some burnout.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing because she LOVED it and if she wasn\u2019t at practice - she was at home practicing.

On top of that - we have started having her try other sports and activities and she has realized besides gymnastics and cheer - she is pretty athletic and may like some other sports.

I am a goal oriented person, something a lot of gymnasts seem to have in common, and doing gymnastics just for fun was not nearly as satisfying as competing.\n\nTo this day many, many years later this is something I still resent.

There are tons of videos online, watch some with her.  If you have the Peacock app, the sports page carries some of the major meets, some of these are without commentary, have your daughter do it for you.  She will feel as if she gets to show you why she loves it so much. On one of your weekends you could watch the movie Nadia, this might help with a few things. It will let you open a discussion with her about some of the stress and pressure that comes with elite gymnastics as well as finding out her feelings on this and if she is starting to feel some of this pressure. It could also be a great learning opportunity for you both, because the movie was set in the 70s and 80s the scoring was still based on a perfect 10, ask your daughter to explain the current scoring system to you. But she will be amazed at the differences in the gymnastics from the time that first perfect 10 was awarded. There are also some modern shows-movies on Netflix (just search gymnastics) that could jumpstart the pressure/stress conversation.\n\nIf you want to take it to the extreme, the gym I coached at in college had an adult class and we sometimes had parents try out just so they could get the experience.  It was open to all levels and we loved having those parents.  Maybe there is something like that in your area.\n\nGood luck to you in navigating this. Just be careful in pulling her out of her classes, you may think you are just limiting her time, but you may inadvertently make the choice for her if she is going to be competitive or not.\n\nYTA- please listen to your daughter, she is telling you how important this is to her.", "YTA.

The \u201cglory\u201d one receives in the first 20 years of your life might not be worth the repercussions that occurs for the remaining 60-80 years.\n\nHaving a passion is great. Having the self drive to put in the work to improve is admirable and an indicator of future success. But when taken to an extreme these traits that seem positive can become a negative.

Will she develop an eating disorder just try to maintain control of her body?\n\nAn 8 year old isn\u2019t mature enough to make long term decisions for themselves and understand the risk and reward possibilities, that is why they need a parent to make those decisions. Some parents may be willing to play the lottery, and the occasional one will get a Simone Biles, but the vast majority won\u2019t.

Where do YOU then tell people to run and hide to be safe from life?\n\nFor someone that played varsity level sports in uni, you surely don't understand why kids start sports early and succeed at it far better than people that start later in years. In sports, let's say martial arts, an 8 year old doesn't have the strength to be effective. The body grows, gets stronger, catches up to the child who already has the basics down. In gymnastics, the same is true. The power needed comes with age. The body catches up.\n\nAs for the risk v reward? OPs daughter ALREADY showed she does understand that concept. Trampoline bad. Gymnastics good. Both can injure her. She was unwilling to get that injury outside of her chosen sport. THAT shows she, at 8 years old, understands the concept far better than some adults.\n\nAnd, since you don't KNOW who is going to be that next Simone Biles, you get the choice; let your child TRY to be that next sensation, or, dash those dreams because the odds are against them. I, for one, didn't care what the children I raised wanted to be, were passionate about, they had my support to TRY and fulfill those dreams. And no, I wasn't going to \"protect\" them from life.

I went 4 days a week for 3 hours at a time. Stretching at home daily. Watching gymnastics on tv. \n\nI loved it! Until I started high school and realized I was never going to be an elite gymnast, and was experiencing far too much stress for what was essentially a hobby. I realized I was fairly mediocre as a gymnast, and never did well in the upper level competitions for my age group. \n\nAs an adult, I *wish* my parents had encouraged me to have a more well-rounded relationship with sports. For me, gymnastics was extremely isolating. All the other kids at my school could hang out together, but I had to rush to gymnastics. They could talk about their hobbies together, but nobody knew or cared about gymnastics. \n\nI spent my early teen years with major self confidence issues after losing the one thing I was \u201cgood at\u201d. If I had played a team sport, I think I would feel less isolated, less pressure to perform, less stress over the financial burden to my family, and I would have experience with a less obscure / niche sport.\n\nI don\u2019t know if your reasoning is coming from the most altruistic place, but you are correct to be worried about her level of commitment to a sport like gymnastics. It\u2019s a lot to take on at such a young age, and you basically retire out of the sport at the \u201cold age\u201d of 20.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even getting into the horrific examples of abuse that have come out over the past several years. \n\nYou and your ex both think she\u2019s too involved.

Yeah I know she's only 8, but it can be a dangerous sport, like all sports.  I'm sure right now, that's what she wants to be when she grows up. When I was 8 I wanted to be a homemaker lol. Doesn't mean I was learning to cook and clean and all that. So it is very impressive she has this discipline and determination!

I was a ballerina for most of my childhood. I loved it, I would've done nothing but dance if I could. I couldn't, for multiple reasons (because I was growing up with a narcissist mother who estranged my very kind and reasonable father, remarried an enabling man with cult ties, had me in charge of raising my siblings, and because I was a sickly and chronically ill child). Still, if I wasn't being a little mother I was dancing, even at major detriment to my own health. Some adult should have stepped in the first time I had a seizure or severe allergic reaction in ballet class. Some tried, but my mother always brushed them off. She's a scary woman and not many were willing to cross her. I loved ballet and it was all I knew. \n\nAnyway. It all came to an end in my mid teens, when I had a seizure-related major fall that resulted in a spine injury and shortly after that a dance related knee injury. Both healed improperly and still cause me issues and will for the rest of my life. I had to restructure so much of my life. I still miss it, painfully so, though I know with my health issues (even before the injuries) that I should NEVER have been allowed in such a competitive and physically demanding sport. It was not safe for me and I was badly injured as a result. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that when your kid is in a sport to this degree, you as a parent absolutely MUST be involved.

From what I've read, you aren't involved in your daughter's life or sport to the degree that you'll know if things are getting dangerous. I'd say, go to her competitions, learn, pay attention.
