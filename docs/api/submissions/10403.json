First, being a level 6 at age 8 means she is very good. It means she is an optional meaning she can create her own routines. Prior to that each level has to do the same floor routine. And while there is a lot I still dont understand after 10 years, I\u2019m wondering if you have EVER even watched her compete or you would at least understand that much?? After level 9, they are elite, like competitive in a national level. For context, my daughter is 15 and a level 7 and she started at age 4 and started competing at 7. And most girls in her level are teenagers. So yeah, for being so young. She\u2019s awesome. \nI agree though that it is concerning she doesn\u2019t even want to have a fun day and I understand you wanting her to have a normal childhood. In fact, I applaud that, because I\u2019ve seen parents take it too far, pushing their kids. \nBut if you take this to court and/ or make her quit you will ruin your relationship with your daughter. And as she gets older activities like this are going to help with self-esteem, depression, and keep her out of trouble. Think about when you were a kid: what was the ONE thing that really helped you when you were having a shit day, being picked on, did bad on a test, whatever that helped you to know you were worth something? \nAlso, stop complaining about her working out instead of spending time with you. Do you have any idea how many parents would love if their kid was active and worked hard like yours does? \nSo yeah, maybe go to her competition if you have not, and maybe just keep an eye on things . If you push it it won\u2019t go well with your ex, or your daughter. Time will tell and if things get worse maybe your ex will see what you see?", "YTA. My guess is that If she were a boy playing football or baseball and hoping for a college scholarship, you\u2019d view your child as a passionate, driven, and hard working athlete instead of viewing it as obsession or somewhat of a hobby. Leave her alone if you can\u2019t support her, but shame on you for not supporting her more.", "YWBTA\nYou're gonna COURT ORDER her to stop doing something she loves? Thats crazy. Your job as a parent is to teach balance to her. I did gymnastics when I was her age and I loved it. You take that away from her she's not gonna want to see you because you'll be the person who took away something important from her.", "Lemme get this straight: You wanna make your kid miserable because *checks notes* she doesn't wanna spend her time with you?? \n\nYTA. Let your kid live her life. If you miss her, offer to take her to lessons. Sit in the gym and watch her. Take INTEREST in your kid's activities and loves.

This is great! Maybe she'll lose interest when she's older, and maybe she won't, but - assuming your lawyer doesn't laugh you out of the office at trying to prevent your daughter doing gymnastics - why would you want to be the parent who made her give up doing something she loves just because you're not interested in it?  \n\n\nBe a good dad!

She might achieve that. She may grow up and become a trainer FOR olympians. She may grow up and decide to be something else.

Not because of the issue with the sport, that's a complex decision.

The fact that all you have to say about her dream is that \u201cher chances are pretty low\u201d speaks volumes to your character. Support her. Learn about the sport she loves.

There are lots of reasons to worry about gymnastics as a sport but you chose a narrow band of it being a problem because it fucks with your schedule and you have no obvious interest in learning about the sport or why your daughter loves it. Great work, great job", "YTA\n\nIf your child likes a sport, you should encourage it.", "YTA. Yes, YWBTA for the action you are considering,but Y already TA for your attitude and treatment of your daughter.\n\nYou don't even know what a level 6 in gymnastics is. Neither do I, but I don't have a kid with an abiding passion either. If my kid was into a sport, you're damn right I would know what that term was because I would be taking her to competitions and classes and, yes, arranging time with her that wasn't sports-related, but that respected her schedule. \n\nYour child isn't your property and you have no right to take away something she loves because YOU don't like it. If she is too involved with something, work WITH your ex and stop casting her as the villain of the story. \n\nI'm sure your ex and Eve would appreciate you taking over some of the duties of conveying Eve to competitions and, if you live close enough, to classes and other events. You could be spending time with your daughter participating with her passion.  \n\nDon't bother if you're going to cut her down or belittle her interests, though. The fact that she had a panic attack at trampoline park makes me wonder if you just didn't listen to her and forced her into going and she had to lose her shit to get you to stop.

After a couple of years, my brother and sister in law changed training gyms because they did not like the coaches, their attitudes towards the students and training methods.

If you care so much, actually get involved in her interests.\n\nAlso, who cares if she will never be an Olympian?! Are you saying she can only do sports that she will be the absolute best in and that\u2019s all that matters? She loves it and is apparently very good! Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nThis seems like straight up jealousy on your part that your daughter is focused on something else during the time you have with her.

As a parent you should want your kid to do something they enjoy and she enjoys it. The development in that sport will help many other sports in the future if she loses interest but I don't see a justification to forcibly stop something she loves. She could resent you for it. If she wants to try her hand at becoming an olympian you must let her try and fail/succeed, she needs to know it wasn't you that halted her dream. However, I feel bad about the fact that you're getting a super short end of the stick here in terms of being a father, this is completely bs. You need to figure out some way to negotiate more time you would be able to spend with her, also for example you can get her to teach you gymnastics.", "YTA.  Let her enjoy and love what she\u2019s doing.  If you force her to quit she will resent you, only making your relationship with her even more strained.", "YTA. This is something that your daughter loves and wants to do, and she's the one driving her involvement in gymnastics. Lots of kids that age are heavily involved in a sport. It sounds more like you're jealous of her gymnastics than you being concerned about her.  Moreover,  If you try to stop her from being involved in a sport she loves, she will resent you for the rest of her life, and for good reason.", "YTA Maybe you could work something out with your ex, so you can be part of her gymnastics. Watch a class or go to a competition. If it is about spending time with her this would be great.  Most young ones change their minds as they get older, she may too.  You need to support her she will remember that, she will never actually like you unless she feels loved and supported.  So there you go. **STOP.** Whatever happened with your ex which caused you to have limited time with your daughter is **NOT** her fault, if you don't like it you have options but it is **NOT** your daughters problem.", "YTA.

If she loves it and she\u2019s good at it, it might be something she can excel at enough for a college scholarship or it could simply inspire a lifelong love of fitness. None of the behaviors you have indicated are at all concerning.

Major AH for doing so. Maybe try and read up about the sport and understand it more to have conversations and connect to her through her interest. If this is something she has a huge interest in then walk alongside her, don't try and cut her off at the knees because it's something that you don't understand. \n\nAlso i will add that YTA for thinking that your daughter isn't Olympic material. Even if she isn't what sort of parent are you to think so lowly about your child?", "YTA.\n\nIf anything, your daughter is showing good judgement by avoiding the trampoline park. Its fine to want balance in her life, but balance at the cost of stealing something she loves is flat out cruel. Find another way - such as limiting her YouTube time for example.", "YTA It would make sense for a serious athlete to want to avoid getting injured just goofing around on a trampoline. Trampolines are actually pretty dangerous. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for parents of budding gymnasts to exercise caution, but, given that your daughter loves the sport, your reasons for wanting her to cut back seem selfish and petty. Your main complaints seems to be that she\u2019s not paying enough attention to you and showing enough interest in the things you think she should be interested in.\n\nYou should try to bond with your daughter by showing interest in HER interest. Aren\u2019t there practices or meets you could attend? If she wants to watch gymnastics videos, couldn\u2019t you ask her to explain some of the moves to you, and talk to her about why she enjoys the sport and what her goals are and which  gymnasts she admires?\n\nYou could educate yourself about some of the actual risks and dangers of the sport and try to protect her from those.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nGood job on being selfish and a terrible parent. Why don\u2019t you go to her competitions and learn more about the sport she loves and start being supportive?", "Yta", "YTA. Why don\u2019t you get more involved in gymnastics so you can bond over that and then also she will listen to you more if you suggest cutting back for a balanced life? Go to her meets, learn what the levels are and what they mean. When she is at your house stretch with her and watch videos with her. She obviously has a passion for gymnastics if she is doing stuff on her own so bond with her over what she loves, not what you want her to love.", "Oh hell! Go for the court order\u2026 I am sure if you force her to stop doing what she loves all that love will transfer to you.\n\n\nOh, wait, it doesn\u2019t work that way! \nYTA", "NAH... I see both sides of this argument. \nMy daughter is now 13, started gymnastics and dance when she was 3, and trains between 15 and 30 hours a week. \n\nUnfortunately for her dad the majority of these hours are on his time with her. Which means he doesn't see her as often as he would like. \n\nHOWEVER, we asked him to get involved a little, attending a competition or two with us and watch her perform, meet the teachers etc. \n\nHe realises now dancing is her dream and her passion. He's still annoyed he doesn't see her as much as he would like but he doesn't take it out on her. \nGet involved and then see how you feel before making any rash decisions. Her dedication might surprise you!", "This is not going to be a popular opinion. \n\nNTA for wanting her to quit BC you truly think it's detrimental to her.  YWBTA if you just up and forced her to quit without any communication about your fears and concerns. \n\n So I'm coming from the mindset of someone who is married to a high performance coach. He wants all three of our kids to enter his sport (it is literally his life and passion). He will also not allow our kids to start training until he believes they are old enough (12 ish) This is bc he believes it is very easy for a child to be overworked and over trained. It leads to mental health issues and physical problems later in life and he has seen it over and over.  \n\nOur kids are involved in a variety of sports but none of them are hyper competitive. We make it clear the sports they do are for enjoyment and physical health. If they do compete there is no emphasis on winning but rather the experience for its own sake. I know this isn't everyone's mindset but it is the one we hold. \n\nI think you need to have a long hard talk with your ex and your daughter about next steps here.

I have a gymnastic daughter and while after 10 years, I still don\u2019t understand it all, I certainly knew as soon as she was competing what it meant to be one level or another. It sounds like OP has no involvement in this at all and hasn\u2019t even seen her compete. I could be wrong, but just the way it\u2019s worded makes me think he hasn\u2019t taken any interest or asked her anything about what she loves", "Also cirque de soleil is always looking", "Really.  I\u2019ve seen some amazing collegiate gymnastics.", "Seems like this guy is so disconnected from his children that he would be the same. Unless his kid was a moneymaking sports machine, he wouldn\u2019t give a shit. He wants his two weekends a month with no problems. Kids come in, he does his thing with them, kids go out. Emotionally absentee parent is what he is.", "Amazingly, I did a 30 second google, which it seems more than OP could be bothered to do. There are 10 levels. 1 is the lowest, 10 is the highest. As an 8 yr old, OPs daughter is a level 6. \n\nLevel 6 gymnast. That means she is not only able to do competition gymnastics, but, able to do competitions where she makes her own routines.\n\nWith some encouragement and support from her parents, she very likely could go on to be a level 10 gymnast. She'd have 10 years of training and competitions to get into college on a scholarship. 10 years of training for the olympics, etc, if that is her goal.\n\nAnd OP wants to take that away from her. Just sad.", "I feel like it\u2019s not fair assumption to say I\u2019m an absent father? I\u2019m there for my kids..I would love to spend more time with my kids. but I live Houston and they live Dallas for people who aren\u2019t familiar it\u2019s about a 6 hours drive round trip and I work full time and I actually pay for her lessons/ classes and it\u2019s not cheap in the slightest. My concern is more about time management for my daughter and how this can become unhealthy in the future I feel like my concerns are valid.", "There are so many scholarships too! College gymnastics is becoming a bigger and bigger sport every year with numerous schools adding teams, if she's a good gymnast and continues to love the sport and stay relatively healthy that could fund her entire higher education right there and give her a community of people to surround herself with. Also potential NIL deals as well!", "Then instead of taking this away or attempting to force the issue, how about taking more interest in the sport and use your time with your kid to involve yourself more with her hobby to really understand it?  \n\nIt's clear from the OP that you don't have any knowledge or understanding of the sport. It also looks like you're framing this as a problem primarily because of how it affects you. \n\nIt's fine to be concerned about your daughter overtraining or choosing unhealthy coping mechanisms, but you can balance that with a true interesting her as a person is separate interests and goals for her life. She's going to respond a lot better to you if you show respect for her interests.", "I learned what level 6 gymnast's are in a 30 second google after reading a post on the internet. Your daughter is 8 years old and you didn't take 30 seconds over the years she's been doing it to find out. It took an 8 year old to tell you that jumping on a trampoline is dangerous, could injure her, and remove her from physically being able to do her passion; gymnastics.\n\nYes. It IS fair to say that you are absent and so far removed from her and her passion since you didn't even know what her level in gymnastics meant, much less it took her refusing to do an activity because SHE didn't want to jeopardize her ability to physically do it.\n\nShe's 8 and found her passion. You should be ecstatic about that, supporting her, and letting that passion take her wherever it takes her.\n\nAnd you want to FORCE her to quit it? Yeah, she will resent you and hate you for the rest of her life if you do it. THAT would really be worth it, wouldn't it?", "You haven't taken even taken enough interest in your daughter to Google the basics of the sport she's passionate about. That's hardly making an effort to connect with her.", "Dude, Houston to Dallas is like 3.5 hours. Are you driving a horse and buggy?", "Again, all about you and your sacrifice and nothing about your children. Give a shit about your daughter. Listen to her. Pay attention to her. It doesn\u2019t matter if you make it to them, if when you finally make it you dismiss them and ignore their lives.", "What about getting her some counseling to work on her sport/life balance? Maybe talk to her coaches to see how good she is too.", "Even if she doesn\u2019t become an Olympic or college level competitive gymnast, she is getting exercise, learning about working towards goals, gaining poise from competing\u2026the benefits are immeasurable.  \n\nAs others have said\u2014take an interest and use it to connect with her.  Watch the videos, stretch with her, go to her events, etc.  If you\u2019re concerned about time management, get together with her mom and talk to her teachers, school counselor, and coaches\u2014find out if the time commitment is truly causing problems before making an issue of it.  If you force her to drop something she loves, she\u2019s going to resent you and not want to spend time with you anyway.", "Even IF it ONLY leads to her getting a 4 yr full-ride athletic scholarship, it's worth it. Least, to anyone NOT OP. \n\nMy step-daughter got a 4 yr full-ride academic scholarship. She got a dual degree. Her student loans were a fraction of what everyone else had to get. \n\nOPs daughter is 8 and a level 6. Simone Biles started at 6 and got a trainer at age 8. Imagine if her mother had been OP. No gold medals. No gymnastic moves named after her. No GOAT title. No career teaching just waiting for her to say, \"I'm taking students\", charging whatever she wanted to teach.", "He doesn\u2019t even have to google it! All he has to do is TALK to his personal gymnastics expert. \u201cYour mom said you\u2019re a level 6 but I didn\u2019t even know gymnastics had levels. What does a level 6 do that a level 5 doesn\u2019t? Did you have to take a test or do a demonstration or something to level up? Wow, that\u2019s so cool! I had no idea. So what are you working on now?\u201d", "I said round trip ?", "> My concern is more about time management for my daughter and how this can become unhealthy in the future I feel like my concerns are valid.\n\nOPs daughter is 8 and already a level 6. Simone Biles started at age 6 and at age 8 got with a trainer, hit her elite at 15. \n\nIt sure was unhealthy for Biles starting that young. All those gold medals. Gymnastic moves named after her. The teaching career just waiting for her.\n\nI just don't get people like OP wanting to kill their kid's dreams.", "My mistake. That's still no excuse for not being more involved."]}
