First, being a level 6 at age 8 means she is very good. It means she is an optional meaning she can create her own routines. Prior to that each level has to do the same floor routine. And while there is a lot I still dont understand after 10 years, I\u2019m wondering if you have EVER even watched her compete or you would at least understand that much?? After level 9, they are elite, like competitive in a national level. For context, my daughter is 15 and a level 7 and she started at age 4 and started competing at 7. And most girls in her level are teenagers. So yeah, for being so young. She\u2019s awesome. \nI agree though that it is concerning she doesn\u2019t even want to have a fun day and I understand you wanting her to have a normal childhood. In fact, I applaud that, because I\u2019ve seen parents take it too far, pushing their kids. \nBut if you take this to court and/ or make her quit you will ruin your relationship with your daughter. And as she gets older activities like this are going to help with self-esteem, depression, and keep her out of trouble. Think about when you were a kid: what was the ONE thing that really helped you when you were having a shit day, being picked on, did bad on a test, whatever that helped you to know you were worth something? \nAlso, stop complaining about her working out instead of spending time with you. Do you have any idea how many parents would love if their kid was active and worked hard like yours does? \nSo yeah, maybe go to her competition if you have not, and maybe just keep an eye on things . If you push it it won\u2019t go well with your ex, or your daughter. Time will tell and if things get worse maybe your ex will see what you see?", "YTA. My guess is that If she were a boy playing football or baseball and hoping for a college scholarship, you\u2019d view your child as a passionate, driven, and hard working athlete instead of viewing it as obsession or somewhat of a hobby. Leave her alone if you can\u2019t support her, but shame on you for not supporting her more.", "YWBTA\nYou're gonna COURT ORDER her to stop doing something she loves? Thats crazy. Your job as a parent is to teach balance to her. I did gymnastics when I was her age and I loved it.

She might achieve that. She may grow up and become a trainer FOR olympians. She may grow up and decide to be something else.

Yes, YWBTA for the action you are considering,but Y already TA for your attitude and treatment of your daughter.\n\nYou don't even know what a level 6 in gymnastics is. Neither do I, but I don't have a kid with an abiding passion either. If my kid was into a sport, you're damn right I would know what that term was because I would be taking her to competitions and classes and, yes, arranging time with her that wasn't sports-related, but that respected her schedule. \n\nYour child isn't your property and you have no right to take away something she loves because YOU don't like it. If she is too involved with something, work WITH your ex and stop casting her as the villain of the story. \n\nI'm sure your ex and Eve would appreciate you taking over some of the duties of conveying Eve to competitions and, if you live close enough, to classes and other events. You could be spending time with your daughter participating with her passion.  \n\nDon't bother if you're going to cut her down or belittle her interests, though.

After a couple of years, my brother and sister in law changed training gyms because they did not like the coaches, their attitudes towards the students and training methods.

As a parent you should want your kid to do something they enjoy and she enjoys it. The development in that sport will help many other sports in the future if she loses interest but I don't see a justification to forcibly stop something she loves. She could resent you for it. If she wants to try her hand at becoming an olympian you must let her try and fail/succeed, she needs to know it wasn't you that halted her dream. However, I feel bad about the fact that you're getting a super short end of the stick here in terms of being a father, this is completely bs. You need to figure out some way to negotiate more time you would be able to spend with her, also for example you can get her to teach you gymnastics.", "YTA.  Let her enjoy and love what she\u2019s doing.  If you force her to quit she will resent you, only making your relationship with her even more strained.", "YTA. This is something that your daughter loves and wants to do, and she's the one driving her involvement in gymnastics. Lots of kids that age are heavily involved in a sport. It sounds more like you're jealous of her gymnastics than you being concerned about her.  Moreover,  If you try to stop her from being involved in a sport she loves, she will resent you for the rest of her life, and for good reason.", "YTA Maybe you could work something out with your ex, so you can be part of her gymnastics. Watch a class or go to a competition. If it is about spending time with her this would be great.  Most young ones change their minds as they get older, she may too.

If this is something she has a huge interest in then walk alongside her, don't try and cut her off at the knees because it's something that you don't understand. \n\nAlso i will add that YTA for thinking that your daughter isn't Olympic material. Even if she isn't what sort of parent are you to think so lowly about your child?", "YTA.\n\nIf anything, your daughter is showing good judgement by avoiding the trampoline park. Its fine to want balance in her life, but balance at the cost of stealing something she loves is flat out cruel. Find another way - such as limiting her YouTube time for example.", "YTA It would make sense for a serious athlete to want to avoid getting injured just goofing around on a trampoline. Trampolines are actually pretty dangerous. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for parents of budding gymnasts to exercise caution, but, given that your daughter loves the sport, your reasons for wanting her to cut back seem selfish and petty. Your main complaints seems to be that she\u2019s not paying enough attention to you and showing enough interest in the things you think she should be interested in.\n\nYou should try to bond with your daughter by showing interest in HER interest.

Why don\u2019t you get more involved in gymnastics so you can bond over that and then also she will listen to you more if you suggest cutting back for a balanced life? Go to her meets, learn what the levels are and what they mean. When she is at your house stretch with her and watch videos with her. She obviously has a passion for gymnastics if she is doing stuff on her own so bond with her over what she loves, not what you want her to love.", "Oh hell!

I see both sides of this argument. \nMy daughter is now 13, started gymnastics and dance when she was 3, and trains between 15 and 30 hours a week. \n\nUnfortunately for her dad the majority of these hours are on his time with her. Which means he doesn't see her as often as he would like. \n\nHOWEVER, we asked him to get involved a little, attending a competition or two with us and watch her perform, meet the teachers etc. \n\nHe realises now dancing is her dream and her passion. He's still annoyed he doesn't see her as much as he would like but he doesn't take it out on her. \nGet involved and then see how you feel before making any rash decisions. Her dedication might surprise you!", "This is not going to be a popular opinion. \n\nNTA for wanting her to quit BC you truly think it's detrimental to her.  YWBTA if you just up and forced her to quit without any communication about your fears and concerns. \n\n So I'm coming from the mindset of someone who is married to a high performance coach. He wants all three of our kids to enter his sport (it is literally his life and passion). He will also not allow our kids to start training until he believes they are old enough (12 ish) This is bc he believes it is very easy for a child to be overworked and over trained. It leads to mental health issues and physical problems later in life and he has seen it over and over.  \n\nOur kids are involved in a variety of sports but none of them are hyper competitive. We make it clear the sports they do are for enjoyment and physical health. If they do compete there is no emphasis on winning but rather the experience for its own sake. I know this isn't everyone's mindset but it is the one we hold. \n\nI think you need to have a long hard talk with your ex and your daughter about next steps here.

That means she is not only able to do competition gymnastics, but, able to do competitions where she makes her own routines.\n\nWith some encouragement and support from her parents, she very likely could go on to be a level 10 gymnast.

And Eve's current situation means her shot at the Olympics is not totally unrealistic. So sit down about that one.\n\nIf you are concerned that Eve's connection with the sport is toxic, get more involved and find out what's going on. In fact, get more involved anyway. Do a few stretches with her. Watch some videos. If you can't follow her about gymnastics, talk to her about music. If the trampoline gym, and all the people in it being reckless on the equipment, scare her, step aside and play a few games of air hockey or skee ball - most trampoline gyms have that option.\n\nA thing to be aware of about your eight year-old is that she is clearly not a normal kid. Normal eight year-olds don't do 45 minutes of self-directed stretching. Because your daughter is not a normal kid, she is never going to have a normal childhood. She can have an AMAZING childhood, but it isn't going to be what you expected, just like Eve is probably not what you expected.\n\nI also want to speak to you as a divorced parent. I don't think kids are necessarily terribly harmed by divorce, but one thing I definitely noticed in my own kids is that divorce really made it clear to them that they don't control their own lives. They were pretty pissed at me about that for a while and I just kind of had to take it on the chin, because no way was I putting eight year-olds in charge. The children's desire for control led them to try acting out in some fairly startling ways to take control back. \n\nYou do not have a child who can be satisfied with coating the coffee measuring spoon with dish soap. Eve is a lot more driven than that.\n\nSo, if you want Eve to cut back on gymnastics (which is going to be a hard sell, and I would not rely on the courts to help with it), you need a substitute activity. Which, Eve being Eve, bless her, is going to get just as intense about. If you don't supply such an activity, and sell Eve on it, she will invent one. You may not like what she comes up with.\n\nIf you are concerned about balance, take Eve out to do something fun. Teach her to shoot pool or skip rocks or something that you can do with her. Clear a few weekends a year for time for the two of you, go to some meets when she's not in your custody. The more balanced you are about this, the easier it will be for Eve to also be balanced. Going to court to make her stop is not balanced.", ">the odds of her becoming an olympian are pretty low\n\nWay to turn something your daughter is apparently very good at into a failure.\n\nYTA.", "YTA!

She has dreamed of going to UCLA to be on their team and she had tunnel vision as a 7-8 yr old. She was so mature for her age, but I\u2019ve also realized - I let her do so much so fast which maybe led to some burnout.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing because she LOVED it and if she wasn\u2019t at practice - she was at home practicing.

On top of that - we have started having her try other sports and activities and she has realized besides gymnastics and cheer - she is pretty athletic and may like some other sports.

Ask about it.", "There are also all kinds of places gymnastics training can come in handy. What if the daughter decides to be a stunt woman or something? \n\nEven if she just does it for fun, she's enjoying it now and that's really what matters.", "  Ya m y   Gbch", "Some even compete in college and the Olympics", "She could become a gymnastics coach or instructor", "Holy fk, OP, read this. Your daughter is a gymnast prodigy! She probably COULD be an Olympian!", "Then move closer, seriously do everything in your power to get closer to your daughter.", "How about looking for a job in Dallas so you can actually be an involved parent to your child? You say you want to spend more time with all the kids but you're subjecting them to a six hour road trip TWICE every single time they come over and then go home to their mother. Seeing them more while you still live in Houston means more of those long ass trips which no kid wants to sit through. \n\nEventually they could easily start asking to stay with their mother full time purely due to that journey time, regardless of how \"good\" of a parent you actually are when they do get to see you.\n\nAnd I agree with the fellow commenters; maybe use some of that time your daughter is round your house to actually ask her about her passion? What does level 6 means, what is the difference between being level 6 and level 5, does she actually want to compete at an Olympic level when she's older if she's able to?\n\nJust cutting her off from it, when you only see her every other weekend, is just going to make her hate you and refuse to see you. So yes, YWBTA if you make her give it up.", "whether you\u2019re absent by choice or circumstance doesn\u2019t make you any less absent", "No you are not. So this is the problem? That you pay...cause that's sounds like it.", "So you want your daughter to leave a hobby she\u2019s passionate about so that she has nothing to do for the few days she spends with you a month? What would you do with her if she quit to spend the same amount of time that she spends on her hobby? Forcing her to quit is an asshole move especially since you\u2019ve not even tried to support her in it. YTA", "Have you been to any of her gymnastics meets/competitions?  Or are you only a father when she's with you?  Go see her meets and competitions.  Involve yourself in more than any other weekend.  It sounds like you know absolutely nothing about your daughter's life.  My father lived over an 8 hour drive away (one way) from me after my parents' divorce and he still tried to regularly talk to me and find out about what I loved and my hobbies. Do you do that?  Do you call her when it's not your turn?  Do you go to her competitions?  It sounds like you're very uninvolved if you aren't doing that, talking with her teachers or her gymnastic coaches.  Don't just think because you are paying for the lessons that is all you need to do.  This sounds very much like you want her to stop it because it impedes on your life.  You have to drive 6 hours to see her.  You have to pay for expensive lessons.  THEN DRIVE THE 6 HOURS TO SEE HER.  Find out of there's a gymnastics competition near to you when she has to go to them!  At her level, she's got to be competing in regional and state level soon if she isn't already.  BE A PART OF HER LIFE.  \nYou are NTA yet.  But YWTBA if you take this away from her.", "6 hours drive is not shit when it come to seeing your kids especially 6 hours round trip.", "But it's easier to make his child miserable to get what he wants instead of carrying about the real problem. He just something that won't resolve problems just because he feels it's his right. But he is not there, most of the time but he wants to decide what's best...", "I'm 40 years old. My parents divorced when I was 5. For most of my life, my dad lived the same distance from me, with the exception of 1 year when it was 15 hours one way or the year he was in Indonesia (in in the Midwest US). He was also remarried. Worked full time. And had 2 other kids. Yet i can remember him being at my concerts, competitions, and games. Not every one obviously, but enough that my teammates parents knew him. And this was BEFORE you had a computer in your freaking pocket. Do better. Take an interest in your freaking kid. My dad was a baseball/ basketball/football guy but he could tell anyone what chair I was in concert band, how I did at my last golf match and what the weather was like, and pull out a vhs tape of my sister's ballet recital.", "Do you go to her competitions? If so, how often?"]}
