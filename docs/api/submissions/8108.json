It sounds like that may have been the plan if a bunch of stuff was ditched. Maybe the wedding planner was supposed to collect everything left over for distribution. Maybe they planned for the venue to collect it all and return it to the people who PAID.\n\nYou were a friend to the brother of the bride, and that\u2019s it, that did not entitle you to all the leftovers, and you were not privy to the plan for them. \n\nIt is also a horrible look to look greedy by running off with 50 of the favors from somebody else\u2019s party unless they were directly gifted to you.", "YTA.\n\nDo you have no etiquette? I left a lot of things behind at my own wedding night at the venue, and the venue saved those items for me when I came back the next day. That night of the wedding, one of my guests loved the centerpieces I had no use for, and asked if she could have them. I had no problem with this. I had left my cake topper and my gifted bottle of wine commemorating the event (it was hosted by a winery). I later learned one of the groomsmen \u201chelped\u201d themselves to drinking it because I clearly didn\u2019t want it when it was left behind. I was livid. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s important to the wedding party and what isn\u2019t. \n\nWould it have killed you to walk up to one of the family members, maybe asking the brides mom who was clearly still there?

Without even asking the bride or groom?  That makes you TA.  The favors should have been left for the bridal party to decide what THEY wanted to do with the extras.\n\nAlso, you don't know WHAT they would have done with the extras, they could have been collected and given out as gifts by the bride and groom, ESPECIALLY the wine.   \n\nI don't blame them for wanting you to pay, because you DID steal.", "Holy crikeys, what a mess. That you created. You took 50-60 plants from a wedding you were a simple guest at, because you just assumed they\u2019d be thrown away. Then you got annoyed when confronted. The entitlement is astounding. YTA.", "Of course YTA, you tacky vultures. That you have the gall to be offended at being rightly called out as thieves tells me all I need about you. Sackville-Bagginses, the lot of you.", "YTA - this was incredibly tacky, the fact that you had to pull your car up to load it up!? If you wanted to take the left over plants you should have asked someone and not pillaged the room.", "YTA - I'm laughing at how entitled this is. You mistook a wedding for a free shopping experience! You can't just walk around taking as much of this stuff as you like. Guess it's these situations when someone shows their true colors.", "So you took 50-60 plants AND the bottles of wine and chocolates? Here I was thinking you were one of the last people and there were a FEW items here and there (from the guest tables, you shouldn\u2019t have taken anything off the wedding party tables!!!). You should have asked the bride and groom or wedding party before taking everything off the tables.", "What?\n\n>Rose suggested other people take more plants, which was rude and annoying,\n\nBut it wasn't rude and annoying of you to steal SIXTY plants from a wedding? \n\nGross. YTA.", "YTA.  She called you a thief because you are a thief.  You didn't pay for the favors, but you felt entitled to them anyway?  It's up to the bride and groom to decide what to do with the ones left behind.  You're just a vulture aren't you?", "Fuck is wrong with people", "You\u2019re not just an asshole, you\u2019re a thief and a shitty friend.", "YTA. It wasn't up to you to decide what happens with the leftovers. Maybe they had arrangements with the guests that they pick them up later or they had other plans with them. Without approval from the bride and groom you shouldn't have taken anything.", "YTA\n\n\nYou took the wedding party's favors? Had they even left?\n\n\nAs for the plants, as you said, there were other people who hadn't left yet. You took >50! Green said it was okay to take a few, it seems like you pressured her to let you take more. \n\n\nYou said they would have been thrown out. Why do you think that? They would have been given back to the bride and groom. Maybe they would be happy to keep them. Maybe they could have been donated to a school or nursing home or something. Maybe Green could have asked her sister the next day what she was doing with them, and if she didn't have a plan, ask if your brother could have them.", "YTA.  I'm not saying I haven't taken extra party favors before, as they do often get tossed, but you ALWAYS ask the people getting married if it's ok, first, and you never just ASSUME it's ok.  I also wouldn't have taken even close to all the plants, just a few extra, and then mentioned that if there were any left that they didn't want at the end, to let me know, because I'd like them.", "\" I pulled my car up by the venue, and Green helped me load up the plants. There were a ton of plants and the venue crew were starting to clean up.\" So, you loaded up your car with plants, then had the **AUDACITY** to take items from the Wedding Party Table! WTF! Seriously!!!\n\nDid you think to **ASK** someone first! If you would have BOTHERED to ask, you may have found out the people cleaning up had instructions to collect the items to return to the bride and groom! Then you are confronted by the mother, Rose, who probably PAID for part of the wedding, and you call her RUDE and ANNOYING? What is WRONG with you???\n\nNot only were you arrogant and a thief, most definitely **YTA**!", "YTA How tacky! It wasn't a fire sale, it was a wedding. And obviously the person who paid for the favors had plans for anything left over.", "YTA, holy scrounger, Batman.\n\nYou know that it's common for the bridal party to return the following day and pick up everything left behind? Wedding venues pack that stuff up for collection so that the bridal party doesn't have to take it with them on the night.\n\n\nYou took enormous liberties and completely embarrassed yourself. Look forward to not being invited anywhere with that group again.", "YTA. It should have been \"I'll collect the leftovers for you so they don't get thrown out\" and then given to the bride & groom.  If they had no use for them, they would tell you to keep them. If the did want them, you've scored points for being so thoughtful.  \n\nJust taking them?  No.", "YTA extremely. That was in shockingly bad taste. One or two extra I could see since there were a bunch left but scavenging up every plant and then casing the venue and housing bottles of champagne too? How gauche. We left everything after our wedding and it was packed by the venue and returned to us. You don't have any idea what their plans were or what they wanted to do with their favors. Yikes.", "YTA. Taking 1 plant with your name on it is a party favor everything after is theft. You had absolutely no idea what the venue staff was instructed to do with left behind items. They very well could have been instructed to gather them for the family to pick up. The audacity is astounding.", "YTA this is tacky as hell.", "YTA. \n\nIt is one thing to take a few extra favors when the room is pretty clear, but you DO NOT do a sweep of a wedding venue and take anything not nailed down. \n\nThere is a venue director or wedding planner that goes through and gets anything the couple forgot or others forgot. This venue wasn't empty and closed, as you mention people were still waiting for rides. The wedding party could be helping the couple with last things, or even just left and forgot. That is what the cleanup staff are for - to collect forgotten items and give them to the couple to get to the rightful owners. You are not the cleanup staff, you are guest, and had no right to decide what was left behind intentionally versus what was forgotten by accident. \n\nYou stole from the wedding, end of story, because you had no idea who might come back for stuff and who wouldn't. So repay the cost of what you stole, and do better in interacting with humans.", "YTA. You don't know that they would be thrown away. The clean up crew probably would have kept them but the real issue to me is you assuming they were up for grabs and then grabbing them all. Did it occur to you to ask someone before you pulled your car around to load up your haul?", "You know, I was mostly on your side with the plants.\n\nBut the wine and chocolates pushed me over the edge.\n\nYTA. What was Teal gonna do with 60 plants, anyway?", "YTA...there's a big difference between grabbing a couple of extra favours and pulling up the car to clear the place out. Yikes.", "Congrats, you\u2019re a thief\n\nYTA", "I was at a baby shower in my late 20's. they had these ADORABLE stuffed moose center pieces. Grandma overheard me say that they were so cute that I kinda wished I had one. I DID want one, but had no plan to take one, or ask for one, and was embarrassed that Grandma overheard me. She insisted, quietly, that I take one, and when I said that the kids there should have them, not me, she pointed out that there were plenty to go around. That moose spent a year in Afghanistan with me, and traveled all over the States with me as well. Candy got his own Combat Moose Carrying Case, and got tracked down once when the hotel maids accidently sent him down to the laundry. \n\nPoint is, I love that damn moose, and still have that damn moose a decade later, and I still had the decency to be shy about being overheard to covet the decorations. I cannot believe that someone would have the gall to LOAD UP THEIR CAR with pilfered gifts.", "YTA.\n\nTaking an extra party favour or two from your own table when you know the person it belonged to had peaced out is one thing. I have certainly done that. But clearing the entire room????? And then taking the pricier gifts for the wedding party\u2026when the bride and groom easily could have just given them to them next time they saw them? Wtf?\n\nIt would have been best to let the bride know that if they had no plans for the plants you\u2019d happily take them and go from there.", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like the bride intended you to take what you took.", "YTA, when performing a heist like this you really should have a more reliable get-away driver, dude ratted you out before you could escape. But, seriously, you should have asked first; It may not have been the score of a lifetime but you wouldn't have been busted.", "It sounds like Green brother-of-bride intended for you to take only a few extra plants, not dozens, and when he realized that he'd created a monster, became uncomfortable and tried to hint for you to stop.  Honestly, they were never his to give away in the first place; it was his sister's wedding and he probably had no idea what the contingency plan was for the leftover favors.  You don't know that they would be thrown away.  \n\nWhen the mother-of-the-bride became upset and clearly indicated you were out of line to take so much, you should've apologized and started unloading.  So much secondhand embarrassment for you.  You were almost certainly a topic of outraged discussion @ brunch the next day.  YTA", "Oouuuu that\u2019s triflin", "YTA - You just don't take things.  You don't think the bride and groom wouldn't mind taking the chocolate and wine back with them?  If the bride and groom say hey, take extra if you want, different situation.  But the bride and groom bought them, you don't decide what happens. \n\nWe didn't do favors but had candle table centerpieces and we told close family to take one if they wanted one.  Some other people came up and said, can we have one.  They asked!", "YTA, next time ask, don't just start loading your car up.", "YTA, first of all - ask. You couldy asked the staff where the rrst of the plants would go o Rose for that matter. Taking a few is okay, but 50-60? Wow and candy, perfume and vine on top...", "YTA.\n\nLOL if you have to back your fucking car in to take (read: *steal*) the loot...\n\nAnd then you couldn't keep your sticky paws off wedding party gifts!", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you just whip out Tupperware and help yourself to leftover food and cake? Uncultured hillbillies.", "You thought the brides Mom was rude for telling others to take more than one plant??? Plants that you actually stole! WTF! You are the rude one in this situation. Plus you stole things that were gifts to others. You are a huge AH! You're a thief, an entitled jerk and an idiot.", "YTA\u2026 you should have asked the bride or groom before taking the leftover favors.   Or let them know \u201chey my brother studies horticulture so if anyone doesn\u2019t want their plant and you don\u2019t want them, he will take them\u201d.   And you definitely crossed the line taking the wedding party\u2019s favors!   That was really tacky.", "YTA. Eww. I get second hand embarrassment just reading this bull. \n\nI suppose this is one way to receive no further invitations.", "YTA what the fuck is wrong with you? It wasn\u2019t even your friend\u2019s wedding, it was his sister\u2019s wedding and it would be one thing if he was super happy to offload everything to you but he wasn\u2019t! \n\nAlso things from weddings don\u2019t just get thrown away unless it\u2019s food. They all get collected and then given back to the decorator or bride - you are a greedy, rude, asshole b", "YTA;\n\nThat's a very tacky move, one should never just take and should always discuss with bride AND groom before making such decisions (this discussion may have yielded whether or not someone else had paid for them, such as in laws, and might want them had they been left). These discussions and options should also not be done until everyone else is gone to avoid this exact confusion.", "If you\u2019d grabbed a couple like from your own table, that might have been ok.  \n\nBut you cleaned out the venue!! You don\u2019t know that those plants would have been thrown away\u2014 you could have asked.  They might have wanted to keep some or share them with other people who couldn\u2019t make it to the actual wedding. YTA and a thief.", "I'm going to say YTA on this. \n\nEven though the things were left behind, chances are they were just forgotten. I've been to multiple weddings, and someone _always_ forgets something. Sometimes they'll call the person on charge, or the mother of the bride, or _whoever,_ and say, \"Hey, I left my ____, would you mind holding it for me until I come back/we meet up/etc.?\" People come back for things they left all the time. \n\nEspecially in the case of the wedding party. That is some expensive stuff that was meant _specifically_ for them. Taking it without permission is a no. \n\nReally, taking _anything_ without permission, left-behind party favor or no, is inadvisable. All you have to do is ask. Especially if it's just a party for a friend, that you were invited to as a courtesy. If it was your own family, that would be different.\n\nAnd if _you_ have a right to take the party favors, so do the rest of the guests. You can't call someone rude for encouraging people to do what you did. The difference is, _they had permission,_ whereas you did not and simply helped yourself. Rose is the mother of the bride, meaning she had a large hand in the wedding, and therefore, a say in what happens with leftover party favors. \n\nSo, yes. YTA.", "Imagine if the decorations she took were rented. Whew.", "YTA. Taking a few extra would be fine, but you really should have asked the bride and groom if you wanted more. And the wedding party was outside, not gone. Don\u2019t touch their favors.", "YTA, but less for what you did and more for how you did it.\n\nI think the key parts here is amounts and communication. If you had taken an extra plant of somebody who had definitely left, nobody would've said anything. I'm actually with you for the not wasting stuff, especially as plants are alive, but I think you should have asked the bridal party or if they're not there anymore/ busy, the venue if they could not throw them away and if nobody claims them, you'd drive by the next day and save them. After checking with the happy couple, of course.\n\nAs for the larger favours, I doubt they'd be thrown out immediately and it seems like people hadn't really left yet. These are personalised gifts, somebody might be driving grandma home, but they'll probably want to come back for their fairly large and expensive gift. \n\nI agree with you on not wasting, I just think you didn't do due diligence on whether this stuff was actually about to get wasted and went about it the wrong way.", "YTA\n\nSurely the first thing you do is walk up to the wedding organiser or the bride and groom and tell them your idea and ask permission?\n\nThese things were bought and paid for. Not by you.", "Why are you so adamant all the favors were going to be thrown away?? Completely wrong assumption and seems your way to justify being a heathen. YTA for being so greedy and stealing all the favors.", "Dude of course YTA that\u2019s called stealing", "I mean yes, YTA \nBut what happened after? Did you return the plants? This just ends at a crucial moment\u2026", "YTA it\u2019s pretty embarrassing you would even have to ask.", "Leaning toward YTA.  If you were there helping clean up and everyone else was long gone, this would have been acceptable, with permission of the wedding party/family.  However, the way you describe it is that people are still in the process of leaving and you pounced on everything you could get your hands on.  I had a grandmother that would always steal the Sweet N Low and she was an AH too.", "Holy wow, Batman. *Seriously* YTA, one of the least controversial ones I've seen here in years.\n\nYou are a thief. You could have asked the MOB if you could have leftover plants, but you chose to swipe 50 or 60 of them!\n\nEven if they'd meant to let you take all the ones you thought were \"left over\" (as for all *you* know, they could have been meaning to send them on to people afterwards), you capped that by literally stealing expensive favours from the wedding party's table. They were not \"left behind\". It's common practice for gifts to be left at the wedding venue while the wedding party goes off to change, for them then to be passed out to the respective owners during the reception. And *you* were not in the wedding party at all!\n\nI'm still a bit gobsmacked you had the sheer nerve to swipe their expensive gifts without asking any member of the wedding party, then ON TOP of that, *call the MOB rude* for letting other guests do with permission what you had already chosen to do off your own bat *without* it! \n\nIf anybody in this story is \"rude and annoying\", it's you. You ought to be paying *all* of that cost, and you clearly have no clue how good your boyfriend is being to you, to agree to take on half the cost himself for not having been more active in preventing you from behaving like a scrounging guttersnipe at his sister's wedding!\n\nPersonally, I hope this lad dumps you, he seems a much nicer person than you do. You probably won't be invited to a fancy event in that circle again, and even less so if you don't pay them back - and that would be completely deserved on your part.", "YTA this is the brokest fucking behavior. Are you not embarrassed? Have you ever been in public before? You lack basic social etiquette.", "ESH\n\nFirst, I would not offer to pay for the favors. They were there to be given away. Once the family knew you had them, they could have asked for them back. But once they let you go, that's all she wrote.\n\nHOWEVER, you should have checked with the wedding party before taking ANY extra favors! You didn't because you didn't want them to say no, but thats exactly why they were looking at you shady when they caught you.\n\nNext time, just ask! \"Hey I noticed a few people were leaving behind their *insert wedding favor here*, would it be OK if I took them/some? *Insert anecdote about your brother who loves plants*.\"\n\nIt would've been that easy and nobody would've looked at you funny.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then the bride would have decided what she wanted to do with them, if she chose to. She may have already had a plan for someone to retrieve them or with the venue. If you were actually trying to help,I'd be on your side, but in reality you took stuff you intended to keep. Not cool.", "Taking 2-3 extra plants that were CLEARLY abandoned would have been fine.  Taking somewhere near 60??  Not okay.  Taking wine and chocolates not given to you?  STEALING.  How do you KNOW they were going to be thrown away? No seriously- you crossed a serious line.", "YTA. Don\u2019t expect to be invited to any other parties that family throws. You\u2019ve properly branded yourself a thief.", "INFO: Were all of the members of the wedding party actually gone from the venue?", " INFO: You do realise that when the venue staff clear up they put the things belonging to the bride and groom (like left over favours!) separately for them to take home? They don\u2019t just throw them away.", "No plans were made for any left behind favors. As a plant lover, I would find it appalling to buy live plants, only to throw 50-60 away. She shared them, No one cared about them until she took them. As for the wedding party\u2019s \u201c favors\u201d. More likely gifts for the wedding party.  Those should have been surrendered to the mother to give to whoever left them.", "If you notice they are being left behind, maybe grab one extra one. You don\u2019t scavenge for 50-60 of them! Especially without asking! Maybe they had a plan for the leftover plants. Maybe they wedding party was changing into comfy clothes to clean up and didn\u2019t think someone would steal their gift. YTA and a rude one at that!", "I would\u2019ve definitely asked another family member, if the mother was still there I would have gave her, her place. The brother was already hesitant as you said I couldn\u2019t have done this at someone\u2019s wedding. The brother even asked for stuff to be given back to his sister so for me I think this was hint that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable and I feel he couldn\u2019t say no to you for some reason. When the brother said take a few more I don\u2019t think he meant pull ur car up and strip the party bare.\n\nTaking the plants is one thing but taking the wedding party stuff I think this was just terrible.\n\nWhat you could\u2019ve done was take all the stuff in your car and contacted the bride the next day and said Hey, I removed all your stuff as I thought the staff were throwing it out would you like me to drop it off to you? Maybe she would\u2019ve let you keep it and you wouldn\u2019t have needed to embarrass yourself. YTA", "Dude wth\nOf COURSE YTA.\nJesus tap dancing christ", "Had to put my phone face down for a bit because of the embarrassment. Yta", "Every time anyone in this family gets married for the next twenty years they will retell this story. YTA if it's unclear.", "NTA, just give it all back and stay well clear of them. They would much rather let it go to waste than have it to go to some use.", "I work in weddings and can tell you that if everyone has truly left the venue - including the planner and wedding party - those things would have been thrown away or taken by the staff.  NTA.", "Should have at least boxed up the wedding party favors and given them straight to the mother of the bride, as she was still on site.  Should have probably asked her about the plants too.", "I did this for my wedding.  I had like 20 plants to haul home.  But, you don't take everything but the kitchen sink.  Nothing would of just been thrown away.  If would of been gathered up and collected later.", "Yup, I've worked hundreds of weddings. All this stuff is packed away for the family to pick up the next day. OP thinking that it all goes in the dumpster is so naive as to be laughable. \nI honestly can't get over the gall of her pulling her car up and loading up on everything she can get her hands on.", "_Not the Costco samples\u2014_ XD\n\nAlso, this, extremely!! Taking anything from a wedding not your own should never be done unless you _ask_ first!", "I think OP didn\u2019t ask because they knew what they did was wrong.", "Not to mention she then had the audacity to do a \"last sweep\" for MORE plants... hooooly moly", "Tacky vultures is the best expression I've heard in a while. Thanks for the laugh. \ud83d\ude02", "I would have been understanding of the plants thing *if* she had asked the bride and/or groom. And I wouldn't be surprised if they were just happy the plants would be taken care of.\n\n....But the wine and chocolates and such? There is absolutely no way the bride and/or groom would be so understanding of OP trying to hoard all the good stuff to herself. \n\nJust a shame that the favors didn't include something OP actually needs, like an etiquette book.\n\nYTA, obviously.", "LOL I\u2019m surprised Lobelia here didn\u2019t try and take any silverware left on the table too. Y\u2019know, the plants didn\u2019t bother me too much, but the wedding parties perfume, wine etc? Proper Sackville-Baggins behaviour.", "\u201c tacky vultures \u201c \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Bahahahahaha that\u2019s the best insult I\u2019ve ever read!! \u201cSackville-Bagginses, the lot of you\u201d I have died, and my ghost it typing from beyond the grave. \n\nYTA OP", "Did you steal the silver spoons too?", "I expected OP to say they took an extra for Teal...not 60! On the other hand, did the wedding party seriously leave 60 plants to be cleaned up by the venue staff?", "I left my jacket at the wedding, I probably should check OP\u2019s car for it.\n\nGreen said take \u201ca few\u201d not clean the place out, I can\u2019t imagine having that much audacity to pull the car around. Unless someone who had some control (ie bride/groom) said it\u2019s ok you should not be leaving a wedding with so much that you need to pull a car around. Geez, I hope they cleared the gift table before you \u201csalvaged\u201d it.", "Please accept my nonexistent award for the use of Sackville-Baggins. \n\ud83e\udd47", "\"tacky vultures\"\nI'm dying", "Probably expected the bride to cover second breakfast too.", "I'm picturing OP putting flower arrangements, glassware, chafing dishes, tablecloths and purses that were left behind in their car. Just grabbing anything that wasn't nailed down.", ">Guess it's these situations when someone shows their true colors.\n\nBlue, green and teal \ud83e\udd23", "Is anyone else starting to wonder if Teal is a real person? Is a \u2018little brother who studies horticulture\u2019 just mentioned to distract from OP seeing an opportunity to get a bunch of stuff to sell on marketplace?\n\nRegardless, YTA big time", "Did he go to the kitchen and ask for a doggie bag of leftover food too?", "The difference between your one stuffed moose and OP is that you took ONE stuffed moose. She took 50-60 things and even things from the wedding party table. I could see taking maybe one or two extra plants, but even then I would feel bad. The number she took is honestly crazy.", "I once borrowed some wicker hearts for table decorations. Before the reception was half over, people started taking the decor off the tables to put in their car. We had to chase them down to take them back!", "She was cleaning up, but not the good kind.  The venue was doing the actual cleaning, she wasn't helping.", "How do you know that? It's an assumption on her part. She should have at least asked if that was the plan and if so if she could take the plants.", "Some venues have a next day clean up. My venue has 2 options 1) Friday & Saturday (until 11pm) and Sunday (until 12pm) access, 2) Friday & Saturday (until 11pm). My guests may not know which one I selected. If OP had asked first they could have actually saved themselves a lot of drama. I will also say wedding party gifts should have def been off limits.", "absafarkingutly.. the bride / groom left them to be taken..they dont care who takrs them and they  certainly dont want them and if they are not gone, they get tossed..too funny.. nta ..", "No wonder the username is \"ChlorophyllBandit\". Getting Poison Ivy vibes. _\"Rescue all the plants from being thrown away!\"_\n\nSuch a rude way to behave as a guest. \n\nDon't expect to be invited to anything else, OP.", "This, at my wedding, we did a sauce as our favour. Some people left or forgot them, and a friend of mine asked if she could take them, which I was all for, lol.\n\nWe also had a candy table and another guest asked if they could take a couple of extra bags(which again I was like please take it all!!!) Because I didn't want it to go to waste. But they both asked first", "I worked at wedding venues, most likely the bridal party and bride/groom were doing a combination of the below: \n\n1:  doing final goodbyes, finalizing contracts, etc., and they/someone would be along soon enough to collect items \n\n2: had made arrangements to pick everything up the next day (lots of venues include that as part of the contract), \n\n3: they had intended to leave extras for the staff as a thank you\n\nI seriously doubt 60 plants were going to be thrown away no matter what Op wants to imagine up to justify being a tacky vulture", "The partly eaten cake came to my mind.", "exactly!!!", "I know! Maybe two extras? Even three extra would embarrass me. I\u2019d hate for the others to be trashed, so I could see myself asking the bride about them with no shame there, but to walk around like staff just taking things\u2026", "Bro that\u2019s so insane!!!!", "I have a feeling that the plants weren't party favors and OP is just calling them that.", "And the idea that they were going to be thrown away shows how naive she is - I have worked hundreds of weddings across many, many venues. The plants, chocolate and wine would have been packed and set aside for collection by the family the next day.", "Yeah, every wedding I've been to there's been extras and some leftovers of some kind that people end up asking about.\n\nBut I still can't get over OP asking her friend to pull up the getaway car, swiping everything that wasn't tied down, and then throwing a fit when she's confronted over her atrocious behavior.", "I hadn\u2019t thought of 3 (leaving things as a thank you) but you are so right! Especially plants or flowers, if they staff wants them, of course.", "At my nephews wedding while they were saying goodbyes to guests etc, someone tried to swipe the  bridesmaid's bouquets and gifts.  Thief said oh I thought no one wanted them.", "But it was left behind and they were already cleaning!!!", "Or given as a thank you gift to the staff at the venue! My mom worked housekeeping at a popular wedding venue, she often came home with leftover favors and stuff given to her by the wedding parties. But only *after* they were collected, and given a chance to be reclaimed by the guests and members of the party who wanted them first!"]}
