Before one of the arguments, we were on a date which was going well. We both like physical touch so sometimes we get carried away with eachother. She had family problems at the time so I wanted to make her feel loved and was kissing a lot, everything at the time was fine.\nAfter the date we got into a fight. topic was irrelevant but she said in the moment that she didn't feel comfortable with kissing her at that time. I asked her \"You know I wouldn't do anything to you\" and she said \"I don't know\". This scared me. We've always been very handsy with eachother and there have been times when she's wanted to kiss me when I didn't feel like it, but whenever that happened I didn't take anything by it, because I knew she loved me and was just trying to be affectionate. I told her that she should be able to feel good with me and I quickly offered to make a safe word. She said no.\n\nAfter the argument she revealed that she didn't feel that way AT ALL, and that she was just stressed and wanted a throwaway comment. I was relieved that she felt this way, the comment was still very damaging to me. I love her and don't want her to feel that way. I just left it.\n\n From then on I've been less touchy, not noticeably, just initiating less. I don't want any of us to be uncomfortable.\n\n[The situation]\nSince our past fights, we've been much better. On the walk back from the gym she went for a kiss, I know she went for an innocent kiss however that argument always replays in my head and I didn't go for the kiss. I understand that I could've stopped the fight that followed if I just kissed but just the thought that she may feel unsafe with me made me not reciprocate. I told her \"i don't want to\", she walked off.\n\nWe got home, I explained to her that the reason I didn't kiss her and have been less touchy in general is because of what she said back then. She told me that she didn't mean anything by it. I appreciated that she said that but I said it was damaging and that I'm still gonna be physical with her but more cautious. I always kiss her but this time I just didn't want to.\nShe said that its not fair and I'm being pathetic for not kissing her. Said that I shouldn't bring up things from weeks ago, I have done things which are worse. I understand what she means however I'd rather her tell me anything that still bothered her. No matter how long ago it was. She said that \"kissing isn't a boundary\". I said i shouldn't have to kiss her when i don't want to, she thought the opposite. She started calling me manipulative and depriving her of touch? Although I've kept saying to her that I'm still going to be affectionate with her.\nI knew this wasn't going anywhere so I tried to end the convo, i told her just to respect my boundary for now. But then she says that I cause all arguments, and she can't stand me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667566571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylybdc/aita_because_i_didnt_kiss_my_girlfriend/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
