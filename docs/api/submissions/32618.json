We have had a strained relationship since she never took to me dating her mother. However, I've always supported her in whatever way I could & considered her as my own daughter (I paid for everything throughout her life, including meeting all of the wedding expenses solo). She never valued that, though.\n\nHer biological father's been absent from most of her life since she was a newborn, and yet she wanted him to walk her down the aisle. When my son asked her why she doesn't want me, she said \"I want to have my real father, and not someone who's not even related to me. At least mine never used to like a bulldog.\" (This was in reference to an illness I had, after which I suddenly developed a lot of weight, although I was normal after that).\n\nI was shocked, but did not argue, and I also did not decline to meet her expenses as I'd agreed to it. I attended the wedding & everything was fine after that.\n\nUntil a few months later, when her husband died in a car crash, and she was pregnant. She required help with money, and turned to me for help.\n\nI refused and said \"Ask your biological Dad for this, I am just a bull dog, what can I do?\" She got mad and said I am holding that over her, but I said nothing doing, and asked her to leave my house. My wife's mad at me for that, and saying that I should be considerate.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702062279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dtzwx/aita_for_asking_my_stepdaughter_to_ask_her/", "score": 2044, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You kind of signed up for \"dad things\" like paying for the wedding, college, etc. That's not stuff you can just bring up as a \"you owe me!\" If you agreed to it, it comes with the territory. It doesn't mean you have to be spineless about being insulted and mistreated, but whether or not she thinks of you as her father, that's your kid. Kids from broken families tend to really struggle with rejection issues for obvious reasons, which results in them pushing others away (self-fulfilling prophecy; they think \"no one cares about me\" and wind up acting in terrible ways to \"prove\" it when the people who do care inevitably get upset).\n\nIt clearly meant a lot to you to walk her down the aisle, and it sucks that she was so needlessly cruel about it. I can't imagine why she would say that. That's probably worth working through with a friend or even a counselor, because there's likely a lot of hurt. I think you probably care about her a lot still.\n\nThat said, now is not the time to bring up old wounds. I'm in shock at all the responses saying she treats you like an ATM. For the love of God, her HUSBAND JUST DIED AND SHE IS PREGNANT. Her world has been utterly shattered in ways most of us wouldn't care to imagine. I would posit that she doesn't think you're free money; she thinks you're kind (which you are). She's coming to you since she knows better than anyone that you have the track record of actually caring. This is a chance to be a dad and show that you're in it for the long haul.

She never valued that, though.\n\nHer biological father's been absent from most of her life since she was a newborn, and yet she wanted him to walk her down the aisle. When my son asked her why she doesn't want me, she said \"I want to have my real father, and not someone who's not even related to me. At least mine never used to like a bulldog.\" (This was in reference to an illness I had, after which I suddenly developed a lot of weight, although I was normal after that).\n\nI was shocked, but did not argue, and I also did not decline to meet her expenses as I'd agreed to it. I attended the wedding & everything was fine after that.\n\nUntil a few months later, when her husband died in a car crash, and she was pregnant. She required help with money, and turned to me for help.\n\nI refused and said \"Ask your biological Dad for this, I am just a bull dog, what can I do?\" She got mad and said I am holding that over her, but I said nothing doing, and asked her to leave my house.
