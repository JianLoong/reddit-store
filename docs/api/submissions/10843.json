Even if you pull out in time, pre-ejaculate does contain some semen. The practical use success rate of pulling out (especially when not paired with another form of contraception, like fertility awareness or spermicidal foam) is about 70%. \n\nNot all hormonal contraception results in weight gain, and there are tons of other non-hormonal methods that aren't Russian Roulette.", "NTA \nThey don\u2019t have the money for a child. \nShe could easily use condoms. They don\u2019t cause weight gain or mess with your hormones or don\u2019t involve putting a foreign object in your body. And they come in latex, and non latex", "NTA. One of my cousins got married because she was 3 months pregnant. Both her and the dad are young, they do work but struggle a lot and a major problem is their immaturity.  While I know they love their child you can tell they definitely wish they could go back and change things. \n\nBut yeah if you actively have sex with no protection your more than likely going to end up with a baby, not a flat screen TV or IPad.", "NTA, you were giving her the truth. Most gynecologists will be able to suggest a hormonal birth control method that doesn't cause weight gain..there are many options to choose from.", "NTA you know what makes you gain weight? Pregnancy. Yikes. The pill isn't the only option and she's old enough to be an active participant in her own healthcare. She shared details of her life with you and was met with valid concerns, not judgment. If she's too immature to see that, she's in for a wild ride...", "NTA, all you did was spill the truth. It\u2019s hard, but she definitely needs to know about it and keep it in mind.", "NTA \nShe knows better than to spread her legs without protection", "NTA. It is irresponsible.", "NTA. \n\nYou were trying to tell that the choices she\u2019s making have lasting effects for the rest of her life.", "You're not wrong, but I wouldn't go down that road. Let them screw up. Because they will if they rely on the pull out method!", "INFO:  There is a LOT of misinformation in this thread.  I'll probably get nuked for this, but oh well. \n\nDid you at least check if she was using the method correctly before telling her off?\n\nWith perfect use, pullout method is 96% effective. https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/contraception-advice/does-the-pull-out-method-work#:~:text=However%2C%20it's%20all%20about%20technique,about%2096%25%20of%20the%20time.\n\nThis is very close to the effectiveness of condoms, again, comparing with perfect use of condoms.  \n\nYou have to 1) do it every single time 2) do not reinsert/have sex again after using P/O method before the man washes and urinates.  \n\nI used this method effectively with my husband for 8 years.  The moment we decided we wanted another kid after all, we got pregnant.  It does work, if done correctly. \n\nIf your friend is not quite ready to have a kid, but is secure enough in her relationship that she is willing to roll with it if she finds herself in that 4%, then it really isn't on you to tell her it isn't good enough.  There are drawbacks to every BC, this method may be good enough for them with the lowest amount of hassle.\n\n\n*IF* they are being inconsistent/don't know what they are doing, then you are right to warn her.\n\nEdit:  the reason that so many reproductive health sites don't really recommend this method is because they can't make assumptions about who is reading.  They kinda have to assume the worst, that an immature teen who will forget all the rules is reading the column.  That, and it really isn't appropriate for less committed relationships because it doesn't offer other protection and you have to trust your partner.  It is true that if you are not consistent, you are pretty much doing nothing.\n\nEdit edit: okay you all, I'm not saying that it is blanket good advice for everyone, but you probably shouldn't lecture an adult individual about it if you don't even have your facts straight/know the details.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re 100% correct", "There a zillion \u201cpull out\u201d babies in the world.

Unfortunately not everyone knows that information", "And one of my friends got pregnant using the pill and condoms, another one got pregnant using an IUD, that's doesn't mean those methods aren't effective, it means my sample size is too small.

If your sample size is too small you're not going to get results that reflect reality."]}
