Even if you pull out in time, pre-ejaculate does contain some semen. The practical use success rate of pulling out (especially when not paired with another form of contraception, like fertility awareness or spermicidal foam) is about 70%. \n\nNot all hormonal contraception results in weight gain, and there are tons of other non-hormonal methods that aren't Russian Roulette.", "NTA \nThey don\u2019t have the money for a child. \nShe could easily use condoms.

They kinda have to assume the worst, that an immature teen who will forget all the rules is reading the column.  That, and it really isn't appropriate for less committed relationships because it doesn't offer other protection and you have to trust your partner.  It is true that if you are not consistent, you are pretty much doing nothing.\n\nEdit edit: okay you all, I'm not saying that it is blanket good advice for everyone, but you probably shouldn't lecture an adult individual about it if you don't even have your facts straight/know the details.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re 100% correct", "There a zillion \u201cpull out\u201d babies in the world.

I don\u2019t agree that people should be careless because they can abort, wtf\u2026?\n\nYour judgement is so misplaced, I find using abortion as your birth control worse than being an idiot who believes gaining weight from a pill is somehow more dangerous than a pregnancy, and then the choice of having a child you can\u2019t care for, adoption, or abort etc.\n\nMore I think about it you were judging and trying to justify it. If you\u2019d thought it through I don\u2019t see how anyone would think abortion works in place of birth control.

Pull out method is not a 100% guarantee, but no type of birth control is. I agree with one person\u2019s comment that this is a conversation, not a conflict.

Cant remember in the heat of the moment", "there\u2019s literally SO many alternatives, more options than the ones you mentioned, pulling out isnt a form of birth control. she also said she wont use a condom bc she doesnt feel like it, not because shes allergic. she wont get an iud bc she doesnt like that option. also everyone in this thread in favor of pulling out, fails to mention that you can get pregnant through precum, which is released during the entire course of intercourse, which is why its not a birth control method"]}
