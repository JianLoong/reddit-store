They kinda have to assume the worst, that an immature teen who will forget all the rules is reading the column.  That, and it really isn't appropriate for less committed relationships because it doesn't offer other protection and you have to trust your partner.  It is true that if you are not consistent, you are pretty much doing nothing.\n\nEdit edit: okay you all, I'm not saying that it is blanket good advice for everyone, but you probably shouldn't lecture an adult individual about it if you don't even have your facts straight/know the details.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re 100% correct", "There a zillion \u201cpull out\u201d babies in the world.

I don\u2019t agree that people should be careless because they can abort, wtf\u2026?\n\nYour judgement is so misplaced, I find using abortion as your birth control worse than being an idiot who believes gaining weight from a pill is somehow more dangerous than a pregnancy, and then the choice of having a child you can\u2019t care for, adoption, or abort etc.\n\nMore I think about it you were judging and trying to justify it. If you\u2019d thought it through I don\u2019t see how anyone would think abortion works in place of birth control.

Planned parenthood  states that pre-cum \u201cusually\u201d does not have any sperm in it. But for some people they may have a small amount. \n\nYes there are so many other Alternatives but your stating them like there a 100% fail safe when they aren\u2019t. With every single birth control method there is always a chance of a woman getting pregnant. In my op the best birth control option is to just not have sex unless your ready for the possibility of having kids, or same sex.\n\nAnd yes I agree with her. You are being judgmental. Reproductive care is so controversial mainly due to the horrible side effects it has on woman. I do admit the condom part is kinda iffy.  iuds are known to be extremely painful and getting them out can be pretty invasive. It\u2019s a pretty drastic procedure so I can understand why she might be apprehensive about that. The pills can fuck someone up mentally and physically \n\nMaybe she\u2019s uncomfy with how the condoms feel or maybe it\u2019s one of her boyfriends opinions rubbing off on her. We don\u2019t really know. Did you ever try discussing her bf getting a vasectomy??  from my general knowledge it is reversible so they can have children in the future.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s upset because you only focused on what she could do to avoid having children. Pulling out/withdrawal is also generally considered a form of birth control. It\u2019s not efficient but unfortunately several sexual and Medical articles state it as so. \n\nAnyways here are some other forms she could try: birth control patches. Maybe vaginal condoms if she doesn\u2019t like the feel of male ones. She can get shots for it. Instead of getting traditional birth control pills she can try progestin- only ones. They are considered much better in terms of weight gain and the most complaints about it are irregular periods. They can also try spermicide?\n\nThat method has not traditionally been talked about a lot so I doubt it\u2019s effectiveness. They can try planning it based off of her \u201cfertility cycle\u201d. She can try caps. \u201cPhexxi Pills\u201d or implants. I would also recommend telling her to talk to her general practitioner/doctor(if she has one) or take a trip to the nearest planned parenthood.( if you guys are American) \n\nThey are much better than you(and me) about birth control methods and alternatives that can be comfortable for the both of them.  They also can give free sample/suggestions for her to try.\n\nBut getting back into topic. From your comments yes you are being judgmental. Now that\u2019s not saying that she does not deserve to be judged. But try to be open minded about it. Trying doing it in a gentle manner. She has not committed any crime, nor have people who didn\u2019t use birth control and had kids. Yes people would be happier and the world could be a better place if it didn\u2019t happen. But that\u2019s life.\n\nAtp I don\u2019t think your the asshole. But I def think your being extreme about it. Instead of pushing her to use any specific type of birth control- like I said above push her to a cheap local health care provider who can help, educate and hopefully change her mind about birth control and protection. Sorry that this is so long, I wanted to get all my bases touched before I responded. I hope you guys can make up in the future", "lol mate i promise you, you can get pregnant via pre-cum (i did, it sucked cause we were pulling out as we had no money left for condoms). .

She\u2019ll probably be happy if she gets pregnant and if she\u2019s choosing to raise her baby without being able to afford it I\u2019m sure they would figure it out, ask others for help, use social services etc. But she shouldn\u2019t be dumping this on you if it\u2019s a worry, they could easily use condoms or any other birth control method.
