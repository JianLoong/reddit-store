They kinda have to assume the worst, that an immature teen who will forget all the rules is reading the column.  That, and it really isn't appropriate for less committed relationships because it doesn't offer other protection and you have to trust your partner.  It is true that if you are not consistent, you are pretty much doing nothing.\n\nEdit edit: okay you all, I'm not saying that it is blanket good advice for everyone, but you probably shouldn't lecture an adult individual about it if you don't even have your facts straight/know the details.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re 100% correct", "There a zillion \u201cpull out\u201d babies in the world.

I don\u2019t agree that people should be careless because they can abort, wtf\u2026?\n\nYour judgement is so misplaced, I find using abortion as your birth control worse than being an idiot who believes gaining weight from a pill is somehow more dangerous than a pregnancy, and then the choice of having a child you can\u2019t care for, adoption, or abort etc.\n\nMore I think about it you were judging and trying to justify it. If you\u2019d thought it through I don\u2019t see how anyone would think abortion works in place of birth control.

(It wasn\u2019t super high end since they\u2019re both working jobs with low pays.) However both agree that condoms don\u2019t allow as much pleasure, which is how he ended up with the first child. So you\u2019re NTA.", "What probably offended her was the word \"irresponsible\", but that's exactly what she's being. Especially thinking pull out method is effective. It's been a long while since scientists proved that the most agile and most likely to fertilize the egg sperm come from the pre-ejaculate, not during ejaculation itself. Her argument that she \"doesn't like condoms\"...who actually does? \n\nNTA OP. But I truly feel bad for that child she will inevitably end up pregnant with.", "NTA; your friend\u2019s an imbecile.", "NTA. Ive tried bc multiple times and I'm literally a whole different person on it. But it doesn't mean I don't take preventative measures. I'm religious about keeping up with my calendar and I also did a lot of research on natural supplements that I can say have worked for the last 7 years.", "Without reading: NTA bc ain\u2019t no fuckin\u2019 way.", "NTA and if she's not using protection then she is actively trying to get pregnant.", "NTA, the truth hurts and you\u2019re correct in what you told her. She\u2019s actively choosing not to use any form of protection. So the moment it does happen and she gets pregnant, she\u2019s going to be acting like a victim.", "The only thing I will say about the IUD is that it HURTS. I can completely understand why people don't go for that option because it was the most painful experience I've had. Was struggling for at least 2 or 3 days with the worst cramps of my life afterwards as well. It's obviously different for everybody, and I was told that because I've never given birth, it was likely to be more painful.\n\nNow, I'm not saying she doesn't need BC, she absolutely needs something, but an IUD is not what I'd suggest if she's this against basic things like condoms.", "She's playing the long game of weight loss. If she can't afford food for both herself AND a kid, she can't gain weight. Checkmate!", "The simple question to ask...\n\nTo your parents and their friends, \"how did your kids actually come to exist?\" Lol", "Some people *should* be judged.", "Or have the logic to work out consequences.", "Yep, the friend wants a baby, but wants it to be an \"oopsie! Well, guess I have to keep it now\" situation rather than admitting to herself that she deliberately planned to bring a child into her unprepared life. Hence her \"justifying\" to you (in reality, to herself) why all forms of contraception are off the table and why abortion would not be an option. \n\nThere's nothing you can do about this, OP. If she's really your friend, listen politely and love her anyway. The times we're behaving at our worst are the times we need our friends the most. Or if this has made you realise she's not really your friend, start to distance yourself from her now. Otherwise you'll find yourself on the hook for a shower gift and babysitting duties.", "yep you hit the nail on the head there", "You know why the pull out method doesn\u2019t work? Pre-cum", "yeah i told her no one can make her do anything unless she wanted to, and that she didnt have to use any preventative measures at the end of the day, but considering her position in life it was something she should look into if she wasnt ready for a kid atm", "I got an IUD in January. Was a bit scared going into the procedure because I had heard how painful it could be. Well, for me it was only a couple minutes of mild discomfort and then a sharp jab. I took some ibuprofen for the cramps afterwards, they were bad but nowhere near the I'm-about-to-faint-bad cramps I've had from my period sometimes. So I guess it really depends on the person.", "Exactly!  I don't take any form of BC because I don't need it (asexual.) But i know about a few forms of it and I would never see myself getting an IUD. I don't handle pain very well and the stories that I've heard are terrifying. \n\nIf you're not prepared to have a kid you have to take a little more preventative measures than pulling out. Either that or be open to an abortion. It's selfish to bring a child into this world that you weren't prepared for.", "You know what hurts more? Childbirth.", "What do pull ups mean, other than the exercise of getting your chin over a bar? Haven't heard it used any other way.", "That killed me! Please tell me that was an intended pun \ud83e\udd23", "INFO: do you miss her company or was it a friendship of habit? Good friends sometimes need to say difficult things to each other.", "Um I'm a woman and I love sex without condoms. I definitely prefer it. But I'm also not an idiot and I'm on BC. And additionally I only do it in monogamous relationships after being tested. But women absolutely can get more pleasure out of condom-less sex than with a condom.", "Oh, it 100% depends on the person. My mum had a similar experience to you, but I was curled up in bed crying because the pain was so bad, and nothing I did would relieve any of the discomfort. My fianc\u00e9 was amazing, though. I got ice cream in bed, cuddles, and back rubs every time it started to hurt, so I guess it wasn't all bad, haha!", "I only went for the IUD because my doctor suggested it to relieve some of my PCOS symptoms (hormonal IUD, of course), otherwise, I wouldn't have put myself through that.", "I'm sorry it was so awful for you. I've also been there where nothing you do helps the pain and wouldn't wish it to anyone. Sounds like you have a great fianc\u00e9 though! :)", "I\u2019ve done some research and yes you can get pregnant by pre-cum but the chances are extremely small.  Planned parenthood  states that pre-cum \u201cusually\u201d does not have any sperm in it. But for some people they may have a small amount. \n\nYes there are so many other Alternatives but your stating them like there a 100% fail safe when they aren\u2019t. With every single birth control method there is always a chance of a woman getting pregnant. In my op the best birth control option is to just not have sex unless your ready for the possibility of having kids, or same sex.\n\nAnd yes I agree with her. You are being judgmental. Reproductive care is so controversial mainly due to the horrible side effects it has on woman. I do admit the condom part is kinda iffy.  iuds are known to be extremely painful and getting them out can be pretty invasive. It\u2019s a pretty drastic procedure so I can understand why she might be apprehensive about that. The pills can fuck someone up mentally and physically \n\nMaybe she\u2019s uncomfy with how the condoms feel or maybe it\u2019s one of her boyfriends opinions rubbing off on her. We don\u2019t really know. Did you ever try discussing her bf getting a vasectomy??  from my general knowledge it is reversible so they can have children in the future.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s upset because you only focused on what she could do to avoid having children. Pulling out/withdrawal is also generally considered a form of birth control. It\u2019s not efficient but unfortunately several sexual and Medical articles state it as so. \n\nAnyways here are some other forms she could try: birth control patches. Maybe vaginal condoms if she doesn\u2019t like the feel of male ones. She can get shots for it. Instead of getting traditional birth control pills she can try progestin- only ones. They are considered much better in terms of weight gain and the most complaints about it are irregular periods. They can also try spermicide?\n\nThat method has not traditionally been talked about a lot so I doubt it\u2019s effectiveness. They can try planning it based off of her \u201cfertility cycle\u201d. She can try caps. \u201cPhexxi Pills\u201d or implants. I would also recommend telling her to talk to her general practitioner/doctor(if she has one) or take a trip to the nearest planned parenthood.( if you guys are American) \n\nThey are much better than you(and me) about birth control methods and alternatives that can be comfortable for the both of them.  They also can give free sample/suggestions for her to try.\n\nBut getting back into topic. From your comments yes you are being judgmental. Now that\u2019s not saying that she does not deserve to be judged. But try to be open minded about it. Trying doing it in a gentle manner. She has not committed any crime, nor have people who didn\u2019t use birth control and had kids. Yes people would be happier and the world could be a better place if it didn\u2019t happen. But that\u2019s life.\n\nAtp I don\u2019t think your the asshole. But I def think your being extreme about it. Instead of pushing her to use any specific type of birth control- like I said above push her to a cheap local health care provider who can help, educate and hopefully change her mind about birth control and protection. Sorry that this is so long, I wanted to get all my bases touched before I responded. I hope you guys can make up in the future", "lol mate i promise you, you can get pregnant via pre-cum (i did, it sucked cause we were pulling out as we had no money left for condoms). . Its not entirely likely but combined fertility can be super high and so something unlikely will happen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Op, NTA. She shouldn't be being so stupid.", "I know you can get pregnant via-pre-cum. But like I said it\u2019s rare. You can also get pregnant with literally any birth control method both op and I mentioned. But it\u2019s rare.  (I use rare as low possibly of happening btw)Lot of ppl in this comment section say they\u2019ve been withdrawing for years w/o getting pregnant until they wanted to. So it\u2019s different for everyone. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s stupid- just extremely uneducated on sex and birth control methods.( from what op mentions it def sounds like she\u2019s ignorant)"]}
