I think this girl is either trying to use you or another person in her family, likely a woman, has told her to do this.

You\u2019re totally missing the point: it\u2019s *GF* who said that the jewelry thing is cultural, necessarily implying that it is *common to everyone of that background.* It\u2019s not like OP said everyone of that background is good at math or a bad driver. Fuck\u2019s sake. NTA", "She's sus as heck, tho. If she wants to act like you are rich, she should say that. Sounds like she just wants to look good.

I'm sure that if you share the actual culture here you'll quickly get some ~~brutally honest~~ pretty direct input from people within that cultural group.\n\nI'm going with NTA for the moment.

It's a custom you've never heard of, and you as a naturally curious human being want to look into it. \n\nAfter reading on your recounting of the conversation: it sounds like you might be double checking the custom because you don't trust your girlfriend. When she told you it's a cultural custom, did you question her further to learn about the custom and it's origins? Or did you just take her word for it and decide to double check because you thought she wouldn't give you the truth? Doesn't make you an asshole if you did the latter, but it makes you distrustful and not a good communicator.\n\nTo address the validity of her custom: What is her background? Can you find any reliable sources online about this custom? How did you question your girlfriend about the custom? \n\nAdvice:\n- Try talking to her again to get a calm response (and without insinuating that she's lying to you). What's the origin of this custom? Is there a gift-giving custom for men? \n- If you don't feel comfortable going along with this supposed custom (whether because you can't afford it or just don't want to spend that much money for her family members because this is still a relatively new relationship), then let her know how you feel. How does she react? Is she pushy and forcing you to go along with the tradition, or is she genuinely taking your feelings into consideration? Maybe she might be an asshole for forcing you to take part in a custom when you clearly don't want to.", "INFO - What is her culture? Where is she from?", "NTA-BUT, yes- it is a tradition for certain Indian families. Mine does it and for that reason I didn\u2019t introduce my SO until we were about to get engaged. Then, when he came for the first visit, I bought the jewelry for him, so he could give it as gifts. Our tradition was only for my mother, sister, and the grandmothers, though. Not the aunts.\n\nAll the commenters saying your SO is a scammer need to get sensitivity training. How horrible to just assume this about her based on their OWN traditions. Ridiculous. Also, OP-there are thousands of different cultures in each individual Asian country. You can\u2019t go checking her story with someone else. You just need to decide if you trust her or not.", "ESH \n\nYou can ask multiple people from the same culture the same question and get a different answer from all of them.

Cultural customs can vary wildly. Internet research would have been better than asking a handful of people. \n\nNote, I'm not saying I think you should have to partake in this.

If it had been something like taking your shoes off when you enter the home, respecting prayer time or wearing something conservative that would be one thing but she\u2019s asking you to drop a bunch of money on gifts for strangers (even though you thought they may become more). There\u2019s nothing wrong with confirming an ask this large. You should always try to understand and learn about others backgrounds and cultures especially your partners but that also doesn\u2019t require you to take part in all of them.

You didn't make her cry, she made herself cry to make you feel bad.  I just want to point this out because it's more than a little bit of a red flag.  I won't say all women, but this isn't rare conflict strategy, let's put it that way.\n\nAre you able to speak to her father?  Maybe call and ask him that you've heard of the tradition and you wanted to learn a little more about what is expected.  You might find there's a range of what is expected and buying expensive jewelry was sort of the blow it out of the park end of the range over something more suitable.  This is a guess, but it could explain why she switched to the manipulative approach over trying to work with you to be well received.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.
