Can you find any reliable sources online about this custom? How did you question your girlfriend about the custom? \n\nAdvice:\n- Try talking to her again to get a calm response (and without insinuating that she's lying to you). What's the origin of this custom? Is there a gift-giving custom for men? \n- If you don't feel comfortable going along with this supposed custom (whether because you can't afford it or just don't want to spend that much money for her family members because this is still a relatively new relationship), then let her know how you feel. How does she react? Is she pushy and forcing you to go along with the tradition, or is she genuinely taking your feelings into consideration?

It\u2019s the perfect innocent Christmas prank. Then I could just hide the real sewing tin somewhere and tell them once they gig is up", "This is the best prank I\u2019ve ever heard of. And holy shit my cousins WhatsApp chat is just all of us lamenting we didn\u2019t think of it first", "I\u2019m allergic to hazelnuts and STILL am under its spell lmao - the boxes are fantastic for storing earrings and dainty necklaces too", "Haha that was specifically always an on the way to Delhi thing for us - used to stock up on the layover at Heathrow. Daims and flake on the way back but that was mainly just for my mom and I \ud83e\udee3", "I seem to remember \u201cbut in this kindness\u201d being bandied about a lot, when it meant nothing of the sort ha ha", "The cousins ended up cornering my dad cause they were all pissed about getting 100 Rupees apiece lol. My dad ended up paying them off. They also staged a lovely dance during the pre-wedding festivities and sang a song making fun of white boys. Gotta love those Indian cousins! (Not to mention when people ask how many cousins I have, it\u2019s a complicated answer, cause cousins, or cousins? The answer is either 3 or 30).", "Wouldn\u2019t be easy. This guy has at least one giant ring on every finger, half a dozen necklaces, a gold watch, and several bracelets on each wrist.", "I'm from central Europe so it really surprised me that it's so widespread! \n\nIt makes me really happy that grandparents across nations and cultures looked at those tins and went 'it's free real estate'", "If it's a cookie tin, it's reused as whatever you need. My grandma was sewing stuff. My grandpa was a crap ton of quarters and other odds and ends. It was really neat going through those tins when they passed. Showed the little things about them.", "I'm black and thought it was just us until I saw a twitter thread about it, lol!", "I was ready to throw down, but now I\u2019m gonna go down\u2026 to the store and get some Ferrero Rocher.", "Haha\n\nI swear, some Punjabi songs really are Weird.  My preferences are the more traditional artists.\n\nThe cousin part is so relatable!\nWhen someone asks \u201chow many cousins do you have\u201d, the best reply I found is \u201chow extended are we talking?\u201d", "haha...  \n\n\nmy mom is pretty conservative with money...   \nshe has 24 karat sh\\*\\* bro.  \n\n\nIndian women are on another level, you gotta check out some Punjabi marriages.   \nIf you don't believe me, 11% of the gold in the whole wide world... is held by Indian women for JUST wearing.   Yup.", "Now I need to figure out what I\u2019ll put in a tin.  After destroying the cookies, of course.", "Oh, May their memory be a blessing! \nWhat were they like? \n\nMy family also has some stuff that shows personality. We unearthed old Fotos and travel tickets recently, all neatly labeled and completely forgotten. And old glasses from ages ago my grandparents didn't want to toss out (might still be good, yk?)", "This old school hippie has used a tin for stash since the 1970s.", "Humanity is tied together by sugar cookie tins.", "Punjabi songs are amazing though, let\u2019s be real.", "Lol my response is usually \u201cwell at least 30-40 on my moms side and she\u2019s the white side\u201d", "For wearing? I swear 99% of the things my mom owns are rarely worn", "Yes! :) That's part of the joy of having a cookie tin! I found a ton at Aldi last week that had a music box built in. I have No idea what I'll use that for!", "I keep all my old glasses... what if my five other pairs break?", "They were good people. My grandma loved to keep little trinkets. She had a LOT of tiny tea sets. I have them now :) but some were in that sewing tin. \n\nMy grandpa was always thrifty. He grew up in poverty, born during the Great Depression. The quarters in there may have made him feel better, despite working hard all his life and having a nice nest egg. \n\nSure do miss them. When my mom died, my grandma's dementia/Alzheimer's got worse and my grandpa quit taking his heart meds. It really crushed them.", "Everyone\u2019s got their own taste :)\n\nMine lies with the more traditional ones, yours doesn\u2019t, and I can understand why tbh", "\ud83e\udd23 haha\n\nI am laughing so hard right now", "I know, but they gotta prepare for that once a year event because it\u2019s soooo important", "It had *what*?  I must find this!", "Haha I do that too!! \n\nBut to be fair, I have a small farm. And the first day I got my new glasses, my horse kneed me in the face and bent them up pretty bad!", "Me too! I'd be in trouble though because my eyes have gotten a lot worse though :')", "Oh no.. I am very sorry about your mom and your grandparents. Dementia and heart disease are just unfair. It's never enough time it seems\nAnd they sound lovely! \n\nIf the teapots fit in those tins, they must be really tiny - adorable! I imagine they brought your grandma a lot of joy when she collected them ^^\n\nThe quarters are really charming in an 'I wish he felt more secure' kind of way, though I might project (my grandpa was like that, too. My grandparents were in WW2 as soldier and nurse, so they were very hardworking and frugal when it came to their needs.. but spoiled the grandkids, as you do). But I am glad your grandpa was able to be and feel more financially secure later :) some people deserve all good things in the world", "When Midwest white trash meet India \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Oof, that sounds like it hurt! And just when they were new, typical\n\nHorses are great, but they always remind me that they could throw me around like a sack of flour if they wanted when I least expect it", "Wait what?"]}
