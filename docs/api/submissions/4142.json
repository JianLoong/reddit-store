Can you find any reliable sources online about this custom? How did you question your girlfriend about the custom? \n\nAdvice:\n- Try talking to her again to get a calm response (and without insinuating that she's lying to you). What's the origin of this custom? Is there a gift-giving custom for men? \n- If you don't feel comfortable going along with this supposed custom (whether because you can't afford it or just don't want to spend that much money for her family members because this is still a relatively new relationship), then let her know how you feel.
