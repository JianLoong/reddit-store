She\u2019s been staying with him consistently and is leaving her dog unattended and locked in a back room for 12+ hours or even days.

I called my roommate out and she tried to push it on me for not reminding her how long I\u2019d be away. And lied about coming in at certain times which I knew because I checked our front door camera and there is no recording of her and when I called her on it she just walked out to avoid the fight. \n\nI told her the dog got out of the backyard but I gave her to another friends grandma who recently lost her husband and is living alone.

Obviously she wasn't and didn't care about then at all.", "NTA", "On one level, YTA, in giving away someone else's dog.\n\nOn the other hand, NTA. That person obviously neglects the dog and doesn't care about the dog.  The dog is much better off having someone that will care for it properly.", "This is really hard to give a ruling on. That poor baby deserved more care and attention than she was giving. Not your fault, not your dog, you've got other shit going on. Your roommate is an AH for leaving you with the dog, and more or less abandoning her pup.

She\u2019s done this multiple times, typically when she\u2019s hooking up with or dating someone new and staying with them. \n\nThis had been going on for almost an entire year before I made a decision on anything. I tried to help her coordinate a schedule - offered to help just couldn\u2019t commit the amount she was overall making me do. \n\nWe have a rental and because she left her dog outside we have to completely replace the outside door frame and the siding of the house (she has separation anxiety), when she kenneled her she tore at the cage until she ripped her mail so I understood why she just placed her in the back room for more space and to help elevate her anxiety, but then she never left the back room except to use the restroom unless I took her on a walk. \n\nIt was the lying about coming to care for her pet and when I pulled the camera up continuing to gaslight me and say it \u201cdidn\u2019t catch her\u201d which is straight up not true at all. Then she was gone for 2 days and said \u201cit\u2019s what you get for calling me a bad pet owner\u201d. \n\nI was definitely petty, but there\u2019s no chance my friends grandma will get in trouble. She\u2019s 3 hours away, and my roommate has made no attempts to find her dog. Not even on her personal social media let alone other apps. She asked me if I had and said \u201cshe\u2019s do it tomorrow\u201d and I have yet to see anything happen. \n\nGrateful this is our last month of our lease.", "ESH.  While I agree the dog needed a new home, you stole someone's dog.  That is not ok.  There are appropriate, legal ways to report a neglected animal.", "ESH, your roommate sucks for neglecting the dog, but you can't just decide to rehome someone else's dog. Did you even have a conversation with her beforehand about how you're not willing to be the sole caretaker of her dog, and if this neglect continues, she needs to move out? Obviously the dog is in a better situation now, but you could've handled this differently, because that wasn't your choice to make.", "ESH \n\nIt's never cool to just assume a roommate will take care of a pet. She needed to communicate better with you. \n\nMost people tho would probs have a conversation first instead of rehoming someone else's pet", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, your roommate obviously sucks, animal abuse is horrible \n\nBut you should\u2019ve just called animal protective services, cause you stole that dog and worst of all gave a grandma a stolen dog. Worst case scenario the grandma gets in trouble cause legally it\u2019s not her dog. The dog should\u2019ve been rehomed, but in the right and legal way", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
