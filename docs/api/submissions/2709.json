I love my dad but there were times when I just can not take it anymore. Although most of the time I just go with the flow from the presssure.\n\n\nMelanie's getting married next month. Her wedding was the same date as my business trip but I did my best to reschedule and thankfully, I was able to reschedule and the new date was (Dec 11th). It was a hassle but I did it so I wouldn't miss the wedding.\n\n\nYesterday, I was visiting my dad's home and Melanie was there. I talked about my business trip to Italy on Dec 11th and Melanie acted shocked and confused. I asked what was wrong and she told me that she and her future husband were planning to go to Italy to spend their honeymoon, I was like \"So....?!\" She proceeded to tell me she didn't feel \"comfortable\" having me go to Italy the same time she's spending her honeymoon there. She said it'd somehow ruin the \"whole experience\" (as in going to another country) for her and the thought of me being in the \"same place\" makes her uncomfortable. She suggested I reschedule the trip but I said no way. My stepmom and dad got involved and called me selfish for \"attempting\" to ruin Melanie's honeymoon over a business trip that can be rescheduled/replaced. I said no because I'd already rescheduled and quite frankly, I thought her reasoning was unreasonable and quite ridiculous. They asked that I just cancel then since It's not worth ruining my relationship with Melanie\" but I refused. She left the house after a huge argument and I left too after my dad said that he was disappointed in how I treated my sister and how I shamed her for being uncomfortable.\n\n\nAITA for choosing this trip (unsure about it's outcome wether success or not) as my hill to die on?", "created_utc": 1668860417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzan1g/aita_for_not_canceling_a_business_trip_to_italy/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It will likely lead to some upsets in the short term, but these people are long overdue a reality check.  \n\nIt feels like Melanie wants to be the only person in your family in Italy at that time, to feel special perhaps? Although given her claims of feeling uncomfortable I really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a very odd statement. Why would she feel uncomfortable? \n\nYou might benefit from a bit of grey rocking around these people.

Should I have left when she came in?\"\n\nI think this calls for snide remarks just to show how ridiculous her demands are.
