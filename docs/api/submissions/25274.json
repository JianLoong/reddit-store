My husband argued with me about it and I told him to try me because he is unemployed and we have only been married under two years. I have no desire to be bullied by his parents and wait on them while they are vacationing with me. I was told I was disrespectful and they have no extra money to get another lodging right now. I\u2019m this close to divorce because the last two weeks that they have visited have been hell and I\u2019m stressed.

He can cater to his parents, if he's so inclined. I'd be damned if I'm working full-time and then playing the \"best hostess DIL\" after work for *weeks* at a time. Oh, hell no.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t sign up to be breadwinner and housewife. Screw their traditional gender roles.", "Tell them that you wear the pants in the family and he's a lazy house-husband that doesn't do near enough chores.  he should be catering to his own parent since you have to keep the bills payed.  Then go outside with a whiskey and a cigar.\n\nThat should shock the hell out of them.  NTA, by the way.", "NTA. Talk to your husband about his desire to become an American citizen. Explain that means he also has to respect American culture, he can't take the benefits and expect to be held to American social norms. You will be civil and polite to his parents but he must be firm that they treat you with respect. What is culturally correct in India will not happen here. When he is not working, he is the one to take care of his parents.\n\nIf he can't accept this, then seriously consider if you want to continue in a marriage where your husband will not back you up.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't going to change.\n\nHis attitude is that you (the breadwinner) must also observe the gender roles of his cultural background.\n\nTell him to get off his butt and get a job.

If it's the culture that the wife be subservient, isn't it also expected that the man supports the family? I'd be interested to know if the parents are encouraging him to get a job. Or are they happy he has you as a meal ticket? Now if you'd just get with the program and wait on everyone when you get home from work...\n\nI would make sure that birth control is rock solid.

I say this as a man who did that when I was young, realized the message I was sending, and learned the error of my ways. I'm not saying you need to divorce your husband, only that he is wrong in this and should apologize and create firm boundaries with his family about respecting your relationship.", "NTA, but y'all need lots of therapy or a quick divorce. This sounds deeply toxic. It sounds to me like you and your spouse have a fundamental values mismatch.", "NTA\n\nThey talk about disrespecting culture, but they came to this country to visit their son who married a non-Indian, but clearly they see this as a one way street.

Good Luck!!", "NTA - He is unemployed, and since he doesn't have any other job he can be the one to cater to his parent's. You can have respect for his parent's and not have to wait on them hand and foot at the same time.", "NTA. Explain to his parents that in American culture, the unemployed spouse is responsible for the majority of the housework, and cleaning duties until they get a job.  Since their son is currently unemployed he will be the one taking care of them.  Privately tell your husband that he needs to make sure his parents understand that you will not be catering to them. That his failure to deal with this is damaging your relationship with him. Be careful in using the power you have in this relationship unfairly. I\u2019m sure he is aware of it.

It doesn't sound as if he wants to improve his attitude so you need to think carefully about what your future with him could look like.", "NTA. I have a few Indian friends, but I have serious issues with Indian culture due to how issues due to how misogynistic it can be, and this is a prime example\n\nTell your husband to watch after them lol, it would make no difference unless they thought \u201cthe woman should be doing that\u201d", "NTA\n\nHe needs to go to work!  Why is he unemployed?  What exactly are his parents expecting of you?  Do they want you to wash feet or just sit and talk?  I'm trying to understand what is making this hell for you.\n\nSince you are willing to divorce, are there more things wrong not mentioned here?  If he wants a traditional Indian woman, he will have to go to work and support you, like in India...", "NTA - that sucks and if he\u2019s a reasonable partner he needs to defend you, even against his own family. Obviously there\u2019s different traditions/ways of thinking at play and that\u2019s not always easy way to navigate, especially within interracial relationships.

Def ditch this bum.", "NTA.\n\nRUN.", "ESH - threatening your husband with deportation is really, really shitty.  He's being really shitty  too by demanding you fall in line with incredibly sexist expectations that you never agreed to.  You could try couple's counseling instead of making nuclear threats like this.\n\nIf you don't want to try and makes things work in a healthy manner, you can of course divorce him.  **BUT** if you go to a judge and say your husband was just using you for citizenship (which isn't true based on your acknowledgement that you had a great marriage up until this point), that would make you a liar and pretty awful person.", "ESH. Your in-laws demands and your husband\u2019s reaction to them are terrible, and you have every right to be upset. Jumping right to threatening him with divorce and the immigration implications strikes me as an outrageous escalation.", "ESH- yes you're right you don't need to cater to your in laws but you're focus on \"he's only allowed to be in this country because of me\" is a red flag. Did you guys marry for love or is this an arrangement?", "ESH.\n\nThem for being just being horrible people stuck in the wrong century. You for holding someone's citizenship over their head.

No way, Jose.  Explain to him this is America and in our culture we don't do such things, it is a partnership first and foremost.

And you are very likely correct about the citizenship thing and it is likely to just get worse.", "NTA. You are not disrespectful of his culture, you are refusing to be treated poorly in your own home, in which you do not follow their Indian ideals. If it is important to him to impress his parents and they are impressed by menial labor, he married the wrong woman. If he wants to have a good marriage to the white woman he married, he needs to let his parents know that he doesn't live in India, and in your home, things are done a bit differently. His parents can and should live however they like. But if they expect to have a subservient, quiet, dutiful woman for a DIL, better luck with the next wife. \n\nA month??? What were you thinking!

It's a sexist culture, and should not be respected.", "NTA. An Indian daughter in law here. You're not alone. In our patriarchal culture a husband's family thinks and behaves like God and looks down upon the wife and her family. As if their son rescued the girl from hell by marrying her.

It\u2019s your house and you are under no obligation to provide free lodging. They can go back home if they can\u2019t afford to pay for accommodation.  In fact they should never have come if they could not support their travel and stay in your country.", "NTA. It sounds like the in-laws are just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. You listed several unresolved issues with your partner that are pretty significant. Based on your reaction, you\u2019re at a critical point where you need to decide to either pursue marriage counseling, or follow through on your threat of divorce.", "NTA\n\nthe thing about marriage between different cultures is that the respect goes both ways, you're the breadwinner, THEY need to respect you, your home, and your culture and if they don't like it, they can fuck off. so can your husband if he wants to take their side", "NTA. It sounds like they expected you to cook and clean? I\u2019m not sure what the exact disrespect is. That being said, cultural clashes are tough. You shouldn\u2019t bend over hand and foot to accommodate their culture, but I do feel like being in a mixed culture marriage myself, there are things I would do to appease his parents that I wouldn\u2019t do to my own. I\u2019d never dare call his parents by their first names, for example, even though that\u2019s not how we treat adults who aren\u2019t our own parents in my culture. I greet his parents in a way different than I do my own. Because I\u2019m accommodating their culture. But they would never expect me to cook and clean and act like a slave when they visit. On the contrary, my MIL is super great and helpful in the sweetest way possible. I guess it\u2019s easy for me to accommodate their traditions because they are so kind and respectful to me. It does sound like that\u2019s not the case for you. On one hand, I do believe a marriage can\u2019t work well if the families aren\u2019t on board. It\u2019ll cause a lot of anxiety and resentment on someone\u2019s part, whether it be you or your husband. On the other hand, the families cannot run your relationship.

I know a woman who was so mad at her husband and went straight to the police to tell them he forced her into marriage and blabla.

Not because the cost, or anything like that, but because if that was all she thought of me then we had no possible future. \n\nThat lead to her having a bit of a meltdown then changing her mind. Took me another couple of weeks to accept that, but I knew she had issues around marriage and she had explained she always had.   \nSo I put my issue with that aside and we've gotten over it.   \nNow we're planning on moving out of the US as soon as she's gotten through a few career goals. \n\nMy point is, so long as your relationship is genuine, making statements like that is so deeply demeaning of your partners intentions with and for you.", "YTA for threatening him with divorce because you\u2019re upset. Unless you have actually sat down & calmly discussed this, that is a crappy thing to do & it may well hurt your relationship - especially if you keep doing it.

Maybe you think/thought you knew that, but they live in India. There are very different norms & expectations. Im not Indian, but my family is Greek. We have a similar culture. I\u2019m first generation & my father was born during the depression & he was a much older father. While he put my education first, there was still the idea that the man was the head of the house. I don\u2019t believe that was \u2018wrong\u2019 - it was simply the culture. That attitude is slowly changing, but anyone who marries an immigrant or even an American who has strong ties to immigrant family & a community that still upholds traditions you may find outdated needs to be prepared for that. You need to have a supportive spouse who understands both worlds, however, that\u2019s going to be much harder when he\u2019s also from another country. He may logically understand how Americans are different, but it\u2019s incredibly different when it comes to interacting with one\u2019s parents.\n\nHis parents do likely expect that he has a wife who cooks & takes care of the home. If this is the first time meeting his parents, yes, I actually would have gone out of my way to make them feel welcome. Making a good impression IS important in his culture. Treating people like sh*t is not. \n\nThere isn\u2019t enough time or characters to actually sit here & explain everything to you, so I\u2019ll just say this: if you threaten someone with divorce, be careful because you may get that & more. You\u2019re frustrated & upset right now, but they\u2019re going to go home & you\u2019re still going to have to have a husband.

Your husband isn\u2019t going to disown his family. By even suggesting they go elsewhere, the offense caused is immense.

In all likelihood, his parents will want to live with you (or one of their sons) when they\u2019re old as that is a cultural expectation.

It\u2019s not something you would do to someone if you truly respected and loved them, which makes it a good enough reason to just leave", "He has demonstrated it multiple times during this visit. First by asking her to deal with it, then again every time they treated her badly and he sat there doing nothing and letting it happen, then finally by not supporting her when she\u2019d had enough. That is plenty to know that he\u2019s not a good husband, and a less than 2 year track record is irrelevant, because no decent partner who respects their spouse would behave this way. I do agree should never have mentioned his citizenship, but she absolutely should end the marriage even if that threatens his citizenship. His citizenship shouldn\u2019t factor into this at all, especially not as some mitigating factor that should make OP hesitate to leave his ass", "Good luck to you."]}
