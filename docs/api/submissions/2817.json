We've had them over a handful of times but their visits are not short, the 4 children are very loud, disorderly and disrespectful.

While my kids are ready for bed, her kids are still running around making a mess and raiding the fridge. After a while she says she's tired and should probably get going, and asks to do it again. She doesn't talk much, doesn't help with clean up after meals, doesn't help pick up the mess left by her children, and about 90% of her conversation is about how rotten her X is.

I was very direct and told her no, that we prefer to spend the holiday alone.

If they invite themselves over again, I\u2019d just say you don\u2019t really want to make a big deal out of the holiday, but that you can drop by her place for half an hour with some pie if she wants to say hello. I\u2019m guessing she won\u2019t fancy that and will drop it for a while. Rinse and repeat, alternating with \u2018oh so sorry already made plans\u2019.", "NTA. try to distance your family from them slowly, and maybe they'll understand.

Yay! They\u2019re not disgracing your Thanksgiving table. My mom used to say that when we visit someone, she wants them to be happy to see us - not \u201coh dear God, here they come again.\u201d We didn\u2019t overstay our welcome and we behaved accordingly. Mostly.", "NTA.  They are disrespectful and difficult to have around.  It is no doubt uncomfortable telling them that they can't come over.  Since they have no boundaries at all it's probably a good thing that they stay away.  Sounds like they want a free meal with no responsibilities for the day.  Interesting that they asked to be invited over but no, you do not need to do this anymore.", "NTA \n\nYou aren't obligated to entertain family for Thanksgiving, or any other time. These relatives make you and your family miserable. Enjoy your day without them.", "> and I feel like shit saying no to them coming over for Thanksgiving\n\nSo imagine the feeling when they are over and after as you clean up, replace things they broke, restock the fridge and your kids the next day that got less sleep.  That should  help make your decision.\n\nJust tell her no.  You are going to have a private thanksgiving and requires no further explanation.  Stick to your guns.

You must put your kids first. \n\nAnd if you dont want to tell the truth say you'd rather go out to dinner with them or to the park or something but you've decided in general not to invite people over. As for Thanksgiving say its close family or just you guys.", "NTA. Thanksgiving or not, you should refuse to host people like this. They sound absolutely awful.", "NTA.  She and her kids show no respect, you are right to not be the host to them anymore.", "NTA\n\nIt's really rude of them to just ask if you would host a family of six.", "The best thing about distant relatives is, well, the distance.
