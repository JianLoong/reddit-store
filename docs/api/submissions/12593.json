Wtf?) was completely unnecessary.", "I'm fairly good at a sport in which 95% of the competitors are men.  When the men win which is most of the time, the other competitors gather around the winners to ask tips, talk strategy, get pointers.  When I win, the other competitors will instead say \"wow, your \\[equipment\\] is really fast!\"  It's also fairly common for male competitors who I have just beaten to approach, say it's great that I'm there and then give me tips on how to be faster.  One memorable one told me \"you're pretty good for a woman.\"\n\nAll those men think they're being nice.  They're recognizing I'm in a sport with few women and I'm doing well.  But the way they do that is actually an insult.  I don't need their pointers.  I'm not doing well because my equipment is faster than theirs.  I'm not pretty good for a woman, I'm pretty good period.\n\nCan you not see how demeaning comments like theirs - and yours - are?\n\nYTA.\n\nAnd language matters.  Unless you're referring to the other competitors as \"boys\", these aren't \"girls\".  Language like that is yet another small way to demean women.", "YTA \n\nThe comment you made, whether you intended it or not, suggested that because they were all girls they were less likely to be able to handle to competition. They proved you wrong and won the competition.", "YTA.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the compliment. Had you simply complimented the progress they were making and left it at that, you would have been fine. There was no need to bring gender into it.", "YTA  \nI honestly wouldn't have been bothered by what you said but you could have easily said \"great job, you know two other teams dropped out\" without saying it was a girls team. Had two boy teams dropped out would you have said to the boys \"you know the two other boy teams dropped out\" But also I find it interesting that you rated them 3rd but everyone else rated them high enough to win.", "YTA, I can empathize, but you shouldn't have made it a point during your compliment to mention the other all female groups dropping out. Just a simple 'looks like it's coming along well, good work' would have been appropriate.", "YTA. IF the women adult students are \"girls\" to you, why are the male adult students \"guys\" and not \"boys\"? Why did you only compare the all-women group to all-women groups who'd dropped out? Why did the compliment directed to the all-women group come with a comparison to other all-women groups rather than all the groups regardless of gender? I hope you examine your deep-seated gender-based biases.", "YTA for how you complimented it. The other girls work was completely irrelevant and the fact that you said they were \"surviving\" makes it sound like you were surprised they were hanging in there.

She\u2019s correct that it wasn\u2019t a compliment. Why are you gendering the groups as \u201cgirl\u201d groups, let alone comparing them? \n>\nThe young lady who called you out was correct in her assessment, and also quite bold to call out a judge. I hope she goes far. (Who knows she may end up being your boss in 10 years).\n>\nEdited to add Q: Are these \u201cgirls\u201d in high school or college? I assumed they are HS because why would you call college women \u201cgirls\u201d however based on your obtuse comments, I\u2019m starting to wonder now.", "YTA - You're not TA for complimenting their project; you're TA because you singled them out for their sex and called attention to the fact that the other groups that were all women had dropped out. Did you make note of which all male groups had dropped? Did you go around to the other all-male groups and point out that they were sticking to it when other men had dropped? No, you did not. \n\nIt's weird of you, as a judge, to comment on how they were still sticking in when others had dropped. They're not in those other groups.", "YTA for bringing gender into your comment. The team took exception (and rightfully so). \n\nIt\u2019s about a mindset shift. Next time, ask yourself, would I say this to all teams and act accordingly.", "Yeah, YTA. The way you phrased it wasn't just complimenting their project for its own sake, it was attached with an implicit caveat that they should be particularly proud because the two other all-girl groups had dropped out - i.e, \"the trend indicates that all-girl groups can't hack it, so well done for bucking that trend\". The word \"surviving\" was a particularly poor choice because it brings to mind the age-old stereotype that girls don't work well together and they were somehow soldiering on in spite of their supposed genetic tendency to tear each other apart.", "Comparing them to another girl group was wrong. It wasn't necessary and pointing out gender in a biased way as to say girls can't code. \n\nAsk yourself if you would have done the same with guy groups? Obviously not.\n\nThis comes from someone who can code in multiple languages. I don't wake up and say because I am a woman, it is a miracle I can code.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nWork in a male dominated field. And there were 3 girls in my course at college. Only 1 finished, and she became the \u201clast girl standing\u201d\n\nWhy? 30 people finished the course, loads of people (male and female stood out). Why was she not just another finisher. But was singled out as the only girl who finished. \n\nThere was no need for the comment. You couldve just said they were doing well, or even mentioned the other teams dropping out, but without saying \u201cthe other girl teams\u201d. \n\nYoure giving them special credit for just being there, which is patronising. If you thought their project was good\u2026 say the project was good and leave it at that. \n\nHats off to the girl for sticking up for herself and taking it through to complaint. \n\nI dont think youre a bad person, but i think this was a bad comment\u2026 and you got called out on it. Takw the L. Move on. Be a bit more conscious in future of how things come across. Again.

Treat them the same.", "This is where I wish there was a YTF option, you're the fool. Your intent doesn't come across as assholish but putting all the women into one judging basket is not cool and I would be mad too. Womens successes can just be their successes, you didn't need to make the comment about the other group. Ask your higher ups if they could invite a speaker to do a workshop for staff to learn better about how to foster a good environment for women's/ everyones success in stem. Judgement wise, failing a YTF vote, its gonna have to be YTA", "YTA. But not for the reasons you think.\n\nYou're not an asshole for complimenting their project, but for saying it in the same sentence regarding the other female groups that dropped out. You should have just complimented it and not made it about women in science.", "YTA. Come on. You know what you did.", "YTA it wasn\u2019t eh compliment that made you TA. It was comparing them to the other girl group. You know that, don\u2019t act stupid.", "I mean, you DID compare them with the only other female team, stating they dropped out. Yes, the implication that girls \"normally\" can't handle those things are there.\nWould say NAH though as I assume it was just a case of bad phrasing, but you might want to consider those things more carefully going forward. Especially in a professional setting.", "YTA.  At a bare minimum, you were patronizing.   There are appropriate times and places to talk gender.  When you are judging a competition where contestants solely want to be recognized for their work, you are not in one of them.", "Kind of a shame this keeps coming up, yet it keeps the conversation going, and some people \u2018hear\u2019 - that is \u2018get\u2019 a point only when it\u2019s made a different way. Maybe some day gender, race and such won\u2019t be such a marker. I get it, OP is genuinely trying to be encouraging. The point made earlier - would he have made the same gender reference to an all-guy group - resonates with me. Speaking as a woman, we think differently as, for now, we come from different places. That difference is whittling away slowly. As women become more confident through collective successes such perceived slights will be shrugged off rather than addressed. Until then, patience, Sisters. It\u2019s coming.", "Your intentions make you NTA but your wording did warrant that response because you mentioned the other girl groups. Of course they would think you were implying that \"its good work for a girl\". Should have just kept it at the game was looking really good.", "NTA,\n\nYou're complementing a group of female contestants on their performance. Nowhere did you say: \"oh boy, for a group of girls you're pretty good. I'm surprised\" or anything close to that.\n\nThem not being able to take a compliment and feeling offended and even worse go tell on you to a manager because of it? That seems to be sexists from their part. Would they have taken the compliment if you were female?", "Against the grain here, NTA - you didn't say they were doing well for girls, you said they were doing well and (I assume) meaning that you're glad they didn't drop out like the other teams. Polite small talk seems to have been weaponised and taken out of context here... Maybe I'm an AH too?", "NTA people are just constantly looking for something to complain about.

The judges may or may not be at the event, depending on the specific Jam -- like, during Global Game Jam, what my school did was, we had our own voting on whose games were best and they \"won\" within our group, but then we all also submitted our games to the actual Global Game Jam itself and they were judged there. \n\nTypically when I participated, I'd do like.... 1 hour of work, 20 min break, repeat that 3-4 times, then sleep for 3 hours, then repeat the whole cycle again.

The objectification in the term, that comes from its use in science, connects with our experiences as women being objectified. This connection has likely been strengthened in the last few years by the fact that \u201cfemale\u201d as a noun has become almost a calling card for incels on the internet, so women who might not have immediately felt the distinction are catching onto it.

It's kind of common for groups to drop out during Game Jams regardless of gender. Sometimes participants drop out entirely, and sometimes they're absorbed into other groups, but it's generally the nature of the challenge regardless of gender. \n\nBasically, you're given a theme at the start of the Jam and then you have a super limited time -- generally 3 or so days -- to make a functioning game from start to finish. The specific rules vary from Jam to Jam, but usually like... You're allowed to use free assets that already exist for public use and that feasibly anyone could have access to, but beyond that you're generally you're starting totally from scratch. They're meant to be really hard for everyone. \n\nThe closest comparisons I've come up with so far are NaNoWriMo or Inktober -- you have a limited time to do something huge. The \"get it done in time!!!!\" energy is part of the challenge. I've seen people just... cat nap for 20 minutes at a time, and then power through the entire 3 days and build a game solo, and I've seen big groups of 5-10 people who feasibly *should* have been able to finish and remain well-rested end up disagreeing so badly over what direction to go that they don't get anywhere at all and they quit with nothing to show for it. There's also a lot of groups that go somewhere in between. It really just depends on each individual group's chemistry.\n\nGame Jams are entirely peer led -- the judges aren't there to help, they're there to make sure no one is cheating. Your group determines its own project scope, sets its own pace, and assigns its own tasks. There's no outside guidance beyond what your peers are able/willing to give and what you're able to get on Google. To be clear though, most of the time groups are really happy to help each other if they can, but often everyone is so involved in their own group's project that they don't really have time to spare to do much with other groups.\n\nTo give you an idea -- my typical Jam work schedule was 1 hour of work then 20 minutes of break, repeated 3-4 times. Nap for 3 hours, caffeinate, repeat. At one Jam I was the only one with the forethought to bring a graphics tablet, and when I wasn't helping with code, I was churning out art. My teammates slept and I churned out art, and they tied my graphics together into assets while I slept. We'd pull together and code and troubleshoot and bounce ideas off of each other, and we'd split off to do our own respective parts. We developed a sort of rhythm. How well a group does depends on how well they're able to work together with each other, not how well other groups listen to them.\n\nThey're honestly a great exercise in pushing yourself against a deadline, being self sufficient in a situation with minimal consequences, and working with a group under pressure.", "It was a game jam: the only people that need to listen to the people in each group are the people in that group.

The equivilant to \"guys\" is probably more like \"gals\" or something. But even then, for most men, if you called them \"boys\" it still wouldn't carry the weight that the word \"girl\" does because of the generations of misogyny that women have faced. Often misogyny presents-- and has presented-- as infantalization. \n\nNot directed at you specifically but lets stop for a second and remember that while modern men might feel like its been gone for generations, there are literally women still alive who are older than the right for women to vote in many first world countries. Maybe not remember it, we are talking about just barely, but the oldest living person in my country would have been 7 whole years old when women got the federal right to vote. A woman who is a hundred years old today would be old enough to remember when women were declared \"persons\" legally in my country. Heck, my still-living grandmother was born before women in her province had the right to vote in a provincial or municipal election and my mother was nearly ten years old when women in the province she was living in at the time were first allowed to serve on a jury. I'm under thirty and my mom was married by the time marital rape became a crime. My point here is to remind people that even if we can agree we've achieved equality, that misogyny no longer exists, that society has finished that fix and it's good now... this is all still in living memory. Misogyny has still affected young women today because those women were raised by women who dealt with it. It's hard for society to be \"over\" misogyny when inequality is in living memory.

You're doing an awesome job, imo.\n\nAnd good luck with your training!", "Howdy! Woman, coder, multiple Game Jam vet here!\n\nI've commented in a couple places already, but.... \"Surviving\" is common language in a Game Jam. Game Jams are short but super intense challenges, and it's really common for groups to drop out. Sometimes the participants get absorbed into other groups, sometimes they just bow out of the challenge entirely, but it's the nature of the challenge that not everyone makes it to the end.   \n\n\n\"Surviving\" is part of what makes it a challenge. A Game Jam is a little like NaNoWriMo or Inktober, but on a significantly shorter time frame. They're not usually done for prizes, money, grades, or scholarships. They're generally just a fun way to challenge yourself. \n\nYou're given 3 days to create a working game from start to finish. Typically a general one-word theme to follow is given at the opening announcements at the start of Day 1. From there you break into teams, figure out a plan, divide the work, and get to it. It's entirely peer-led. You choose your group for yourself -- they're not assigned or anything. After you've broken into groups, your group sets the pace for itself, divides the work for itself, and completes the work for itself. You're not given any outside instruction -- it's up to your coding knowledge, effective use of Google, and your ability to function as a team. \n\nIf you've mismanaged your time or you've made your scope too big... You don't finish your game in time. Some groups end up with too many people trying to push the group in different directions, and they implode early in the challenge -- \"too many cooks in the kitchen,\" so to speak. But those are all part of the learning process. It's a lot of pressure and you push yourself really really hard. If you make it through you come out on the other end ready to sleep for days and in desperate need of a bath.\n\nGame Jams are really tough, but they're also a really rewarding experience. You code and you learn to function in a group as a cohesive unit under intense pressure. You learn to be resourceful and independent... And it's all in an environment wherein failure is relatively \"safe\". There's no bad grades to worry about and no \"my company didn't make its deadline!\" or anything like that. You're there to challenge yourself, and if you make it to the end, there's an intense feeling of pride and satisfaction that comes with even *finishing* a game. They're little baby games, they're glitchy, they're rough... But they're *yours*. \n\nAnd at the end, it's pretty common to hear people say \"I survived!!!\" regardless of gender.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the rest of it, I can't really judge whether he's TA or not from just what he's written. Some women view \"woman coder\" in a way where the two are entwined as a singular concept, and others are very \"I am a woman and I am in tech,\" with a distinct separation between the two identities. If the first two groups were very \"GIRL POWER!!!\" and the last group was more focused on the distinction between the two identities, it's a lot softer TA than if all three groups were just \"we're women, we all code, we happened to end up together,\" and he called them all girl groups. Without the nuance I can't make a judgement of it.", "Thanks! This was very informative!", "I know of a doctor who will introduce the medical students shadowing him as. (male) \"student doctors\" and \"lady medical students\" *in the same sentence.*", "It's just certain people assume that by calling them female that its meant as an insult.", "Male and female flow better as an adjective and I will gladly die on this hill. I use men and women when talking about the group as a whole but if I'm using gender as an adjective about a specific demographic I use male and female exclusively.\n\nMan engineer vs Male Engineer\n\nWoman Doctor vs Female Doctor", "Holy crap that's so gross!!", "I hear you, but the larger and more common tendency for men to refer to women as females in so many contexts, many of them bizarre, where they wouldn\u2019t use males in place of men is definitely a problem. So, even contexts where it\u2019s \u201ctechnically\u201d appropriate, or let\u2019s say more ambiguous/grey like in this case, it can be off putting.\n\nAlso, the context of the post and it being an example of a man bumbling a well intended interaction with women and struggling to accept that people have decided he was in the wrong, lends to people being less charitable and more critical of his use of female\u2014even when it\u2019s not particularly egregious and may have been ignored in a different context.\n\nAlso, he made it very clear that he was judging a competition between teams of students that were tasked with producing the best game possible. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d have to repeatedly say, \u201cthe team of male/female students\u2026..\u201d after explaining that they\u2019re all students. No one would be confused if after setting the stage, he would\u2019ve said, \u201cOf the 3 all women/exclusively women teams, only one managed to finish\u201d, or, \u201cThere were several teams comprised of only men, a few with both men and women, and 3 teams whose members were all women\u201d. \n\nThis is incredibly nitpicky and in the weeds, 100%, but my point is just that when the crux of the issue is about gender and how women are treated in historically male dominated spaces, it\u2019s pretty reasonable to expect that word choice and language used with regards to gender will be more closely scrutinized.\n\nFor that reason, I think that men in positions of authority and with influence in those environments\u2014like OP\u2014should work hard to learn how to best support women in those fields, and it starts with a willingness to self police and change their own behaviors that may do harm; even when it\u2019s unintended or seemingly a small matter.\n\nI didn\u2019t always believe that \u2018female\u2019 could even possibly have a negative connotation. I thought it was absurd to suggest as much, because it was just a biological term and it was used across all species. \n\nBut, as I thought more about it, and looked at my own usage of the word, I was surprised to find that I did use female more than male, even in basically identical situations. I was/am positive that I wasn\u2019t doing it with mal intent or to consciously convey some belief about gender, but I was doing it all the same, and I saw that a lot of men were doing it too. I just hadn\u2019t really ever thought about it until I started to see/hear that so many women were all too aware of this phenomenon, and really didn\u2019t like it. So, even though I had zero bad intentions, this was a tangible example of how I was treating/thinking of women differently\u2014and more important than my intention, was how my actions/words were being received.\n\nSorry for the long rant, and I have this bad habit of replying to comments that spark a thought and use them as a springboard to a larger/barely related point I want to make. In doing so, it seems like I\u2019m arguing with them (even if I fully agree and I\u2019m just trying to emphasize) or talking directly to them when I\u2019m not.

It is not bad to say male or female students. If that pertains to the subject. \nWe shouldn't apply gender. Yet two groups of female students had already dropped out.

I have seen people in real life tiptoe around some things like this (I once had an advisor refer to me and another woman as \u2018you guys\u2019 and then quickly say \u2018oh no no I\u2019m sorry, I mean, you ladies.\u2019 And I remember being very confused, this was before I knew of such a taboo. He\u2019s probably more pro-women than I am, a woman, which is obvious by his actions rather than his use of gendered nouns). It also seems discordant to me to viciously attack such a subtle or nuanced use of a term/phrase. I mean jfc the attacks I\u2019m getting in the comments for what I feel is not that controversial of an opinion, which I think I am delivering fairly reasonably.

My game proposal was chosen and almost every single one of my classmates (except for two of them- did I mention I was the only woman in my cohort of 16?) told me to my face that the faculty HAD to let my game win because I\u2019m a female. (The department head told me it was because mine was one of the best they\u2019d ever heard- the proposals are anonymous so they didn\u2019t know it was mine until after voting). A few of the guys who I thought would be supportive, because they hadn\u2019t behaved in a sexist manner prior, were extremely butthurt that my game was chosen. Throughout my education, I was constantly doubted and questioned as to how I understood something (like discrete mathematics) when they (male classmate) didn\u2019t. My code was combed through for mistakes in group work when other guys\u2019 code would make everything crash (meaning there was a coding error that was overlooked). OP sounds typical of every single male faculty member who I dealt with, most of whom flat out denied that the industry is sexist (or racist, or has diversity issues). It\u2019s mostly white and male, and it\u2019s an echo chamber that they\u2019re not interested in changing. It\u2019s also why most video games suck, because they\u2019re making them for other guys exactly like themselves, and everyone else can go to Hell as far as they\u2019re concerned. I was in school during Gamergate and the self-pitying whining got intense. I won\u2019t bother repeating any of it- anyone can look up what was going on back then, and then double the effect for it being in person. Women dropped out of other cohorts because they just didn\u2019t want to put up with so much shit, but I was on a full ride for women in tech and determined to graduate. Plus as an \u201colder\u201d student (in my 40s, second career) I didn\u2019t give a damn what anyone thought about me. I had to work 10 times harder to get half the respect, but I commanded respect from day one so I didn\u2019t really care about that either. It\u2019s easier to do that when you\u2019re twice the age of your classmates and it\u2019s your second career (which I still do- I happily juggle both). \n\nSo yeah OP is a major AH. He deserves whatever education he\u2019s getting in the comments because clearly that world hasn\u2019t changed one whit in years. I\u2019ve participated in game jams, and people of all genders drop out for a zillion reasons. Being a woman has nothing to do with it (because clearly the implication is that women can\u2019t hack it). I\u2019ve dropped out before, because I had a good idea that I wanted to develop into something bigger than a game jam would allow. Choosing to be in an all female group is safety in numbers so we don\u2019t have to put up with anyone like OP. \n\nTo all my fellow women in STEM- stand strong. You\u2019re awesome and you\u2019re changing the world for the better. Special shoutout to my software and programming peeps. Keep loving what you do!", "F those guys, you keep on! They don\u2019t have your grit. \n\nIt\u2019s the same at my university, a friend of mine was in physics and she got a professorship right after finishing her PhD. \n\nA group of guys in physics said that it\u2019s because the school was trying to meet a quota and hire a woman.  \n\nShe whooped their butts in grad school and was teaching full courses after first year, the fact that she had been teaching already for 4 years and designed a course is why she got a professorship right away.", "They didn\u2019t smile at him enough. Clearly they weren\u2019t worthy of being judged objectively. You need to smile and be charming to win competitions. Didn\u2019t you know that game jams are also beauty contests for the female participants? \n\n/sarcasm up the yingyang", "See also well practiced artists using dollar store art supplies", "Thank you!\n\nI was reading the comments and it's like, oh no no no, he didn't give anywhere near enough context to make it clear what a Game Jam actually *is*. Dude's gonna get dragged *hard*. \n\nBut the challenge of a Game Jam is super fun. I haven't participated in any recently because I've been too bogged down with work, but even just hanging out in this post is giving me the itch to see if I can make time again!\n\nLike, you end up exhausted to the point where it's 3AM on the night of day 2, you've botched a piece of code in your jump mechanics and now your player launches into orbit instead of making a nice graceful leap over an obstacle, and you *cannot stop* laughing because there's nothing funnier in the world at that moment. But that's all part of the experience!", "As a woman (game dev/designer) and programmer, I fully agree with everything you\u2019ve said. Game jams are hard and people drop out for lots of reasons, often because they know that they won\u2019t finish their idea within the time limit. That happened to me. I was fine with it because I wanted to do more with my idea than just a jam. I\u2019m also an old lady and raging for three days with hardly any sleep isn\u2019t my bag anymore.", "Lol right? They just would scream out, \u201cFemale!\u201d And that was normal. Now this was 20 years ago so maybe it\u2019s changed.", "Ladies, damnit!", "Yeah, as a woman who is also a game dev/designer, I\u2019m constantly reminded that I\u2019m a woman. I hardly need anyone to point it out. OP is pretty typical of my colleagues in game dev. They\u2019re all pretty sexist even though they think of themselves as one of the good guys, exactly the same way OP clearly does. They learn it from their male professors at university, who were similar in their attitudes too (as the only female in my cohort, I was expected to do all the heavy lifting for all the women in STEM, and was criticized when I refused. We\u2019re not a hive mind but we\u2019re treated that way!). If this crap is still happening in 2023, then I don\u2019t have much hope that things have changed much since Gamergate.", "This should be the top comment. All the top comments are getting stuck in game jam lingo and procedure that they don't understand. This actually gets at the root of the problem", "Middle aged fat bald dudes got the most, somehow", "I wish I felt as comfortable at any table as a mediocre white man", "That\u2019s because you\u2019ve not been patted on the back just for existing your whole life, which is where theirs comes from.", "What's wrong with psychology or English :/", "So I\u2019m a game designer/dev/programmer, and during my degree I was constantly being told that \u201cmy female friend said that she doesn\u2019t mind ___,\u201d or \u201cshe told me that ___ isn\u2019t sexist\u201d as though all women share a hive mind and I shouldn\u2019t be kicking up a fuss about something because he already got our collective female stamp of approval. It was exhausting. I had an instructor who always called on me to get \u201cthe female perspective\u201d on whatever the class was discussing and he would get pissed off if I shut that down. But this guy also would say that the only thing women can do better than men is multitask, and even then it\u2019s only the simplest of tasks, so he couldn\u2019t even give us that. It won\u2019t surprise anyone to learn that his fellow (male) faculty members didn\u2019t see a problem with his views. For every guy out there who didn\u2019t care that I\u2019m a woman (and treated me like a fellow human being) there were four douchebags who were torturous to be around. Other fields are probably worse."]}
