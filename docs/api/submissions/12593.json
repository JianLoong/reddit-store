Their gender wasn't relevant.", "YTA\n\nIf their project was good, that\u2019s all you had to say.\n\nTelling them that the other \u201cgirl groups\u201d dropped out, and that \u201cit looks like they\u2019re surviving\u201d (\u2018surviving\u2019?  Wtf?) was completely unnecessary.", "I'm fairly good at a sport in which 95% of the competitors are men.  When the men win which is most of the time, the other competitors gather around the winners to ask tips, talk strategy, get pointers.  When I win, the other competitors will instead say \"wow, your \\[equipment\\] is really fast!\"  It's also fairly common for male competitors who I have just beaten to approach, say it's great that I'm there and then give me tips on how to be faster.  One memorable one told me \"you're pretty good for a woman.\"\n\nAll those men think they're being nice.  They're recognizing I'm in a sport with few women and I'm doing well.  But the way they do that is actually an insult.  I don't need their pointers.  I'm not doing well because my equipment is faster than theirs.  I'm not pretty good for a woman, I'm pretty good period.\n\nCan you not see how demeaning comments like theirs - and yours - are?\n\nYTA.\n\nAnd language matters.  Unless you're referring to the other competitors as \"boys\", these aren't \"girls\".  Language like that is yet another small way to demean women.", "YTA \n\nThe comment you made, whether you intended it or not, suggested that because they were all girls they were less likely to be able to handle to competition. They proved you wrong and won the competition.", "YTA.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the compliment. Had you simply complimented the progress they were making and left it at that, you would have been fine. There was no need to bring gender into it.", "YTA  \nI honestly wouldn't have been bothered by what you said but you could have easily said \"great job, you know two other teams dropped out\" without saying it was a girls team. Had two boy teams dropped out would you have said to the boys \"you know the two other boy teams dropped out\" But also I find it interesting that you rated them 3rd but everyone else rated them high enough to win.", "YTA, I can empathize, but you shouldn't have made it a point during your compliment to mention the other all female groups dropping out. Just a simple 'looks like it's coming along well, good work' would have been appropriate.", "YTA. IF the women adult students are \"girls\" to you, why are the male adult students \"guys\" and not \"boys\"? Why did you only compare the all-women group to all-women groups who'd dropped out? Why did the compliment directed to the all-women group come with a comparison to other all-women groups rather than all the groups regardless of gender? I hope you examine your deep-seated gender-based biases.", "YTA for how you complimented it. The other girls work was completely irrelevant and the fact that you said they were \"surviving\" makes it sound like you were surprised they were hanging in there. They are in CS and are gonna spend literally their entire careers being lumped in with the one or two other women in their departments, I'm just thankful she felt like she could call you out.", "YTA. She\u2019s correct that it wasn\u2019t a compliment. Why are you gendering the groups as \u201cgirl\u201d groups, let alone comparing them? \n>\nThe young lady who called you out was correct in her assessment, and also quite bold to call out a judge. I hope she goes far. (Who knows she may end up being your boss in 10 years).\n>\nEdited to add Q: Are these \u201cgirls\u201d in high school or college? I assumed they are HS because why would you call college women \u201cgirls\u201d however based on your obtuse comments, I\u2019m starting to wonder now.", "YTA - You're not TA for complimenting their project; you're TA because you singled them out for their sex and called attention to the fact that the other groups that were all women had dropped out. Did you make note of which all male groups had dropped? Did you go around to the other all-male groups and point out that they were sticking to it when other men had dropped? No, you did not. \n\nIt's weird of you, as a judge, to comment on how they were still sticking in when others had dropped. They're not in those other groups.", "YTA for bringing gender into your comment. The team took exception (and rightfully so). \n\nIt\u2019s about a mindset shift. Next time, ask yourself, would I say this all teams and act accordingly.", "Yeah, YTA. The way you phrased it wasn't just complimenting their project for its own sake, it was attached with an implicit caveat that they should be particularly proud because the two other all-girl groups had dropped out - i.e, \"the trend indicates that all-girl groups can't hack it, so well done for bucking that trend\". The word \"surviving\" was a particularly poor choice because it brings to mind the age-old stereotype that girls don't work well together and they were somehow soldiering on in spite of their supposed genetic tendency to tear each other apart.", "Comparing them to another girl group was wrong. It wasn't necessary and pointing out gender in a biased way as to say girls can't code. \n\nAsk yourself if you would have done the same with guy groups? Obviously not.\n\nThis comes from someone who can code in multiple languages. I don't wake up and say because I am a woman, it is a miracle I can code.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nWork in a male dominated field. And there were 3 girls in my course at college. Only 1 finished, and she became the \u201clast girl standing\u201d\n\nWhy? 30 people finished the course, loads of people (male and female stood out). Why was she not just another finisher. But was singled out as the only girl who finished. \n\nThere was no need for the comment. You couldve just said they were doing well, or even mentioned the other teams dropping out, but without saying \u201cthe other girl teams\u201d. \n\nYoure giving them special credit for just being there, which is patronising. If you thought their project was good\u2026 say the project was good and leave it at that. \n\nHats off to the girl for sticking up for herself and taking it through to complaint. \n\nI dont think youre a bad person, but i think this was a bad comment\u2026 and you got called out on it. Takw the L. Move on. Be a bit more conscious in future of how things come across. Again. Male dominated industry with female friends\u2026 its so easy for them to be discouraged.. dont contribute to that. Treat them the same.", "This is where I wish there was a YTF option, you're the fool. Your intent doesn't come across as assholish but putting all the women into one judging basket is not cool and I would be mad too. Womens successes can just be their successes, you didn't need to make the comment about the other group. Ask your higher ups if they could invite a speaker to do a workshop for staff to learn better about how to foster a good environment for women's/ everyones success in stem. Judgement wise, failing a YTF vote, its gonna have to be YTA", "YTA. But not for the reasons you think.\n\nYou're not an asshole for complimenting their project, but for saying it in the same sentence regarding the other female groups that dropped out. You should have just complimented it and not made it about women in science.", "YTA. Come on. You know what you did.", "YTA it wasn\u2019t eh compliment that made you TA. It was comparing them to the other girl group. You know that, don\u2019t act stupid.", "I mean, you DID compare them with the only other female team, stating they dropped out. Yes, the implication that girls \"normally\" can't handle those things are there.\nWould say NAH though as I assume it was just a case of bad phrasing, but you might want to consider those things more carefully going forward. Especially in a professional setting.", "YTA.  At a bare minimum, you were patronizing.   There are appropriate times and places to talk gender.  When you are judging a competition where contestants solely want to be recognized for their work, you are not in one of them.", "Kind of a shame this keeps coming up, yet it keeps the conversation going, and some people \u2018hear\u2019 - that is \u2018get\u2019 a point only when it\u2019s made a different way. Maybe some day gender, race and such won\u2019t be such a marker. I get it, OP is genuinely trying to be encouraging. The point made earlier - would he have made the same gender reference to an all-guy group - resonates with me. Speaking as a woman, we think differently as, for now, we come from different places. That difference is whittling away slowly. As women become more confident through collective successes such perceived slights will be shrugged off rather than addressed. Until then, patience, Sisters. It\u2019s coming.", "Your intentions make you NTA but your wording did warrant that response because you mentioned the other girl groups. Of course they would think you were implying that \"its good work for a girl\". Should have just kept it at the game was looking really good.", "NTA,\n\nYou're complementing a group of female contestants on their performance. Nowhere did you say: \"oh boy, for a group of girls you're pretty good. I'm surprised\" or anything close to that.\n\nThem not being able to take a compliment and feeling offended and even worse go tell on you to a manager because of it? That seems to be sexists from their part. Would they have taken the compliment if you were female?", "Against the grain here, NTA - you didn't say they were doing well for girls, you said they were doing well and (I assume) meaning that you're glad they didn't drop out like the other teams. Polite small talk seems to have been weaponised and taken out of context here... Maybe I'm an AH too?", "NTA people are just constantly looking for something to complain about. If u said man for a group of girls u really doing well against the boys. Or something more direct.", "there was nothing wrong with the way you complimented their work. but then again i forget it\u2019s 2023 and everyone likes to nitpick and find the wrong in anything for legitimately no reason. i remember being in school and getting compliments like that from my old teachers and never once have i thought it was rude or intimidating, or whatever the case may be. \n\ndon\u2019t beat yourself up. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
