I\u2019m big on safety and taking precautions. my daughter likes to visit and sometimes sleep the night and just hangout with her aunt/my sister. I allow it since sometimes I go and my sister lives alone. If I have to go to my office for a few hours on weekends, she sometimes goes to my sisters place.\nWhen my sister told me that she gave a guy her key for a bit it made me feel uncomfortable so I nicely suggested that she get her locks changed. Keep in mind she told me she knew this guy for maybe 2-3 weeks. My mind went to my daughter. What if this guy made a copy of the key and randomly comes over, especially when my daughter is there.when I said that, she got mad and said the guy wouldn\u2019t do that. Again, I nicely explained that she doesn\u2019t know for sure and I\u2019m just concerned about her safety.\n\nEdit 1: I forgot to add ages. I\u2019m 30 and she\u2019s 28. My daughter is 6. I also work from home.\n\nI\u2019m a single mom (widow) and I went to get info on a one-bedroom apartment I love. My sister tagged along and in order to get a move-in special, I had to do another tour and it was the first time she\u2019d toured it. She already has an apartment but loved the complex I\u2019m moving to.\n\nAfterwards, my sister asked if I wanted to be roommates. I don\u2019t want a roommate. Keep in mind I\u2019ve told my family about the apartment and they all know im only looking at one-bedrooms. I want to build my life and this will be the first time of having my own place as a single mom (lived with parents then with my fianc\u00e9 before I ended the relationship last year). Honestly, she isn\u2019t dependable financially or time wise. She also has a history of letting guys she barely knows come to her apartment and give them a key. Im not judging as that\u2019s her choice but I am not ok with that all so I just said reasons that I didn\u2019t think would offend her.\n\n\n\nFirst I said no because you can\u2019t smoke \u201cGrass\u201d there. She said she would do it on the balcony and I said you can\u2019t because the complex is strict about it. (It\u2019s brand new apartments and quality housing is hard to find here so I\u2019m not risking anything just so someone can smoke.\n\nShe then said that she\u2019d just go to a friends house to smoke and asked what other reasons do I have. \n\nAt that point, I had to be direct and say that we can\u2019t be roommates because I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with non-related men in the apartment and she got pissed and asked me why.\n\nI have a very young daughter and don\u2019t like being around men I don\u2019t know so I only want to live my just my daughter. I want to be independent and have a stable lifestyle for the two of us.\n\nI said that I understand if she\u2019s comfortable with guys she knows but don\u2019t know them and will not be comfortable. I would only be okay with our dad, brothers and a trusted male family friend that would  only visit and I would pay to help with moving, putting furniture together, etc.\n\nShe was mad and then said that if it\u2019s her place too then she should be able to bring the guy. Remember, this is a hypothetical apartment and she knows that I only looked at and only getting a one bedroom apartment.\n\nI told her that I understand but I don\u2019t agree so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t live with someone else bc I\u2019m very strict about that. She then said whatever and acted mad towards me.", "created_utc": 1677770411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g5awt/aita_for_telling_sister_we_cant_be_roommates_bc_i/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You clearly want to live alone and thats fine! You maybe didnt have to bring up the guy thing to your sister - its a bit shamey.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. Having one reason or 30 reasons just opens you up to arguments with her (and the internet.) Tell her one last time \"that won't be possible and each time you bring it up I'm going to hang up/head home/drop off.\" Then do it. Again and again until she drops it.
