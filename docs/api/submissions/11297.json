I\u2019m big on safety and taking precautions. my daughter likes to visit and sometimes sleep the night and just hangout with her aunt/my sister. I allow it since sometimes I go and my sister lives alone. If I have to go to my office for a few hours on weekends, she sometimes goes to my sisters place.\nWhen my sister told me that she gave a guy her key for a bit it made me feel uncomfortable so I nicely suggested that she get her locks changed. Keep in mind she told me she knew this guy for maybe 2-3 weeks. My mind went to my daughter. What if this guy made a copy of the key and randomly comes over, especially when my daughter is there.when I said that, she got mad and said the guy wouldn\u2019t do that. Again, I nicely explained that she doesn\u2019t know for sure and I\u2019m just concerned about her safety.\n\nEdit 1: I forgot to add ages. I\u2019m 30 and she\u2019s 28. My daughter is 6. I also work from home.\n\nI\u2019m a single mom (widow) and I went to get info on a one-bedroom apartment I love. My sister tagged along and in order to get a move-in special, I had to do another tour and it was the first time she\u2019d toured it. She already has an apartment but loved the complex I\u2019m moving to.\n\nAfterwards, my sister asked if I wanted to be roommates. I don\u2019t want a roommate. Keep in mind I\u2019ve told my family about the apartment and they all know im only looking at one-bedrooms. I want to build my life and this will be the first time of having my own place as a single mom (lived with parents then with my fianc\u00e9 before I ended the relationship last year). Honestly, she isn\u2019t dependable financially or time wise. She also has a history of letting guys she barely knows come to her apartment and give them a key. Im not judging as that\u2019s her choice but I am not ok with that all so I just said reasons that I didn\u2019t think would offend her.\n\n\n\nFirst I said no because you can\u2019t smoke \u201cGrass\u201d there. She said she would do it on the balcony and I said you can\u2019t because the complex is strict about it. (It\u2019s brand new apartments and quality housing is hard to find here so I\u2019m not risking anything just so someone can smoke.\n\nShe then said that she\u2019d just go to a friends house to smoke and asked what other reasons do I have. \n\nAt that point, I had to be direct and say that we can\u2019t be roommates because I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with non-related men in the apartment and she got pissed and asked me why.\n\nI have a very young daughter and don\u2019t like being around men I don\u2019t know so I only want to live my just my daughter. I want to be independent and have a stable lifestyle for the two of us.\n\nI said that I understand if she\u2019s comfortable with guys she knows but don\u2019t know them and will not be comfortable. I would only be okay with our dad, brothers and a trusted male family friend that would  only visit and I would pay to help with moving, putting furniture together, etc.\n\nShe was mad and then said that if it\u2019s her place too then she should be able to bring the guy. Remember, this is a hypothetical apartment and she knows that I only looked at and only getting a one bedroom apartment.\n\nI told her that I understand but I don\u2019t agree so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t live with someone else bc I\u2019m very strict about that. She then said whatever and acted mad towards me.", "created_utc": 1677770411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g5awt/aita_for_telling_sister_we_cant_be_roommates_bc_i/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re looking forward to you and your daughter having your own space. \n\nIf she likes it so well , she can rent her own space. \n\nAdded: Also, set up two beds in the bedroom so you both have a bed, even if she sleeps with you right now. A full and a twin maybe.", "NTA- you don\u2019t even need to justify why you don\u2019t want a roommate. Some people just don\u2019t want that, especially with a child in the picture. Your concerns are completely valid, I would also never want anyone (man or woman) that I don\u2019t know to have free access to my home. Especially with children, that\u2019s a big hell no.", "NTA. You have very specific reasons for not wanting to have a roommate and that is completely your right. I hate living with other people too because of all the variables they bring in.", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to room with her if it's not a match, and the two of you and your living styles aren't a match. It's as simple as that.", "I think OP is NTA. I feel like you were setting a boundary, not just for yourself, but for your child. Your sister not accepting that boundary is not your fault.\n\nI was in a similar situation where I was living with a roommate that was dating a man I was familiar with, but that I felt like I went into fight or flight mode any time he was around. No matter how many times I told my roommate how I felt, she kept disregarding it because she liked him. (They are both nymphos and started sleeping together before their relationship developed and she got pregnant.) I did eventually leave that environment for my own well-being.\n\nI think it's great that you're holding to your boundaries and getting your own place as planned. Good luck OP!", "NTA. It\u2019s a understandable reason. I wouldn\u2019t want strange men or strange women around my child just in case they were dangerous.", "> then said that if it\u2019s her place too then she should be able to bring the guy \n\nShe does realize that you explained why you won't be roommates? It seems she was lost in her defensiveness, and forget she asked for reasons for why you can't be roommates. \nNTA\n\n\nOn a side note, other then her being upset and in the right you're both in the right. I also went to be able to bring people over, even if my roommates don't know them. \nThat's why I won't roommate with people that don't want people they don't know.", "NTA but as others have pointed out, you should have just said \"I don't want a roommate. Periodt.\"\n\nYou do not have to defend your choices/boundaries.", "NTA. Your reasons are solid, and she's defensive because you don't want to move in with her and she feels like that means you don't like her enough to live with her. In honesty, you're right about your daughters safety and your sister is clearly not ready to live with a child.", "I just want to live with my daughter and I end of the conversation all the rest is a non-issue. JUST me and my daughter!!!", "NTA, you have a very valid reason to not want to be roommates with her. Giving somebody a key after only a few weeks is way too soon. And I don\u2019t see why she\u2019s so mad about a hypothetical apartment that you\u2019ve told her she\u2019s not moving into.", "NTA.  You're wise ahead of your years.  \n\nHint:  Roommate situations with RARE exceptions always go BAD.  Her being your sister doesn't improve the odds.  In fact it makes it more assured.  Let her do this behaviour where it's not influencing you or your feeling of safety/security.", "NTA I feel like if you really wanted to explain the reasons to your sister you should have said what you wrote in your post(you want to build your life, be independent, and live by yourself as a single mom for the first time) By the sounds of it you and your sister are at different places in life and that's ok. Your daughter's well-being comes first and foremost. \nI would have thanked your sister for wanting to be roommates, but then moved on from that subject.\nMaybe to mend your relationship have your sister help you decorate your new place. Have her over for dinner and family games.", "NTA for not wanting a roommate. YTA for giving your sister a bunch of excuses she could poke holes in. If you don't want to do it, that's enough.", "\"She got mad and said that if it's her place too then she should be able to bring the guy.\"\n\nThat's...the whole fucking point??? She's allowed to do whatever she wants in her own space. You are allowed to not put yourself in a situation where you share her space. Did she hear herself??? NTA", "She visits the sister.  She lives with OP.", "You might feel you were being polite and nonjudgmental, but I doubt very much it registered to her that way. That's a very sensitive topic and not really something you should opine on unless she directly asks you for advice on exactly that. \n\nSo...great proof that she would not respect the key boundary as a roommate, but not a good look for you.", "Well, I mean, she can get upset if she wants just like you can get worried enough to feel compelled to offer her your unsolicited (albeit, well-meant) advice. Perhaps she gets that way because she knows, on some level, that you have a point. Perhaps she has other reasons. Only she can say. But hopefully you guys will be able to work through and passed this soon (if that's something you guys want) and you will all be better for it. :)", "Personally I'd still go for the 2 bedroom\n. If nothing else storage space.  And when your daughter decides she wants her own room it could still be an option.\n\nShe will be a teen soon enough.band you should have your own space as well", "Thanks", "Her daughter is a minor so yes, she needs to be protected from a roommates guests at this point. When the girl becomes a teenager or older, if OP wants she can look into a possible roommate share.", "OP, regarding the key - many people leave a spare key with parents or someone close in case you lose the original or get locked out. \n\nIf you leave a copy with your parents, brothers or other family member(s), please make sure they don't lend it to your sis, even if she bats her eyelids and asks pretty please with sugar on top - otherwise all the precautions you are listing now will be moot.\n\nGet that apartment or another 1B of your liking and be happy with your child \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67", "To be fair you are judging her but it\u2019s OK to judge people sometimes , you\u2019re judging her for the way she allows unfamiliar men to have access to her home. She has giveb you sufficient evidence to believe that this is true and you made it clear you\u2019re  not OK with guests having free access to your home. You\u2019re totally fine to have the boundaries that you have and also you need to stop acting like you\u2019re not judging her because you are, and for good reason . So either own it or don\u2019t mention it at all", "Because you talked about saying no which seems to be more relevant to saying no to strangers coming over to have sex with her than no to give her key out I doubt the stranger asking her for a key to her apartment she\u2019s giving them out willingly", "Perhaps someone who didn\u2019t read the OP before looking for a fight, looking to talk down to someone, might have made that assumption."]}
