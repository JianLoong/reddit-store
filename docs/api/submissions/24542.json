This developed after eating some bad food on a cruise when I was 12.\n\nMy SIL, Ana, (25) and my brother (29) recently married. She's never had great food hygiene. No one else notices, but all I do is notice these things.\n\nI mostly eat vegan, it just reduces my anxiety and gives me a reason to decline food from people. \n\nMy aunties business was catering for the wedding; I asked to make a chicken dish specially for me. She's the only person I trust to make me food independently. She taught me food hygiene and helped me to trust meat (fish is out of the question, forever) again.\n\nMy brother was so proud of me when I said I would be eating with them, but Ana didn't really have a reaction. \n\nThe wedding:\nEveryone is seated and Ana's mother pushed out a food cart. She then gave a speech about how proud she was that Ana learnt the family recipe for the wedding (some paella dish).\n\nAfter, I subtly got her to speak with me in the hall. I asked her what was going on. She said this was a very important Spanish family tradition, that I need to grow up, stop eating like a toddler and embrace their culture. I spoke & she screamed at me that I was being a baby.\n\nI had several calls and a voicemail from my aunt. Ana had cancelled on her, at 11pm and her mother uninvited her to avoid drama. She only turned up to give Ana's mum my meal for her to put in the fridge. I looked for it - it was on the counter. Probably since morning. So I went back to my table and accepted that I'd cook later.\n\nSurprisingly, Ana's mum brings my meal, piping hot. She took great pleasure in seeming well-intentioned and made sure that my partner and the other guests at my table knew she lovingly cooked me this meal since I'm an awful picky eater. Of course I wasn't going to touch the plate. My partner noticed my discomfort with the food and took it away to ease my anxiety.\n\nI spoke to my brother and quietly explained the situation. I asked him to let the kitchen know I didn't need dessert. Ana overhead and started to cry silently and asked if I really don't trust her that much. I said at this moment, yes. Her crying was no longer silent. Her mother stepped in and blew everything up right at the head table.\n\nI apologised to my brother, then left quickly. He didn't deserve his day to be ruined any further. \n\nThe next week my brother invited me over. Ana said I ruined her wedding and I wasted her money since she still had to pay my auntie. She also said I ruined her wedding photos by looking gloomy with no food whilst everyone else was happy and eating. She pointed out the ONE problem photo where I was barely in the foreground, I have the worst rbf so sure, I may have looked gloomy.\n\nMy brother stayed neutral. But he said it was a bit of a dick move for me to chuck away my food. He said it would have been less embarrassing if I at least ate the vegetables furthest from the chicken. \n\nHis wording of that hurt. That he's essentially saying I embarrassed him at his wedding. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691921585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pv69f/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she didn't want your aunt cooking for everyone, then they didn't have to agree to have a contract with her.  It could've been cancelled a long time before the wedding.
