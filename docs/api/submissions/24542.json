This developed after eating some bad food on a cruise when I was 12.\n\nMy SIL, Ana, (25) and my brother (29) recently married. She's never had great food hygiene. No one else notices, but all I do is notice these things.\n\nI mostly eat vegan, it just reduces my anxiety and gives me a reason to decline food from people. \n\nMy aunties business was catering for the wedding; I asked to make a chicken dish specially for me. She's the only person I trust to make me food independently. She taught me food hygiene and helped me to trust meat (fish is out of the question, forever) again.\n\nMy brother was so proud of me when I said I would be eating with them, but Ana didn't really have a reaction. \n\nThe wedding:\nEveryone is seated and Ana's mother pushed out a food cart. She then gave a speech about how proud she was that Ana learnt the family recipe for the wedding (some paella dish).\n\nAfter, I subtly got her to speak with me in the hall. I asked her what was going on. She said this was a very important Spanish family tradition, that I need to grow up, stop eating like a toddler and embrace their culture. I spoke & she screamed at me that I was being a baby.\n\nI had several calls and a voicemail from my aunt. Ana had cancelled on her, at 11pm and her mother uninvited her to avoid drama. She only turned up to give Ana's mum my meal for her to put in the fridge. I looked for it - it was on the counter. Probably since morning. So I went back to my table and accepted that I'd cook later.\n\nSurprisingly, Ana's mum brings my meal, piping hot. She took great pleasure in seeming well-intentioned and made sure that my partner and the other guests at my table knew she lovingly cooked me this meal since I'm an awful picky eater. Of course I wasn't going to touch the plate. My partner noticed my discomfort with the food and took it away to ease my anxiety.\n\nI spoke to my brother and quietly explained the situation. I asked him to let the kitchen know I didn't need dessert. Ana overhead and started to cry silently and asked if I really don't trust her that much. I said at this moment, yes. Her crying was no longer silent. Her mother stepped in and blew everything up right at the head table.\n\nI apologised to my brother, then left quickly. He didn't deserve his day to be ruined any further. \n\nThe next week my brother invited me over. Ana said I ruined her wedding and I wasted her money since she still had to pay my auntie. She also said I ruined her wedding photos by looking gloomy with no food whilst everyone else was happy and eating. She pointed out the ONE problem photo where I was barely in the foreground, I have the worst rbf so sure, I may have looked gloomy.\n\nMy brother stayed neutral. But he said it was a bit of a dick move for me to chuck away my food. He said it would have been less embarrassing if I at least ate the vegetables furthest from the chicken. \n\nHis wording of that hurt. That he's essentially saying I embarrassed him at his wedding. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691921585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pv69f/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 648, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no circumstance where I'd risk my life for someone else's view of \"politeness\".\n\nWe make arrangements, like OP did, and if those arrangements fall through, we don't eat. Period.\n\nI've been at events where people made a huge deal out of it.  I don't, but other people sometimes feel the need to be controlling in that way.  This is on OPs family, not OP, and I hope that OP can avoid these horrible people in future.", ">\u2026no ken would have noticed\u2026\n\nI know you meant \u201cno one,\u201d but this cracked me up. Maybe ken wouldn\u2019t have, but I bet allan would have noticed!", "Why can\u2019t pregnant people eat seafood?", "This puts them firmly in the 21 month bracket.", "[removed]", "Bad bot", "Ahhh, no the OP broke this rule by directly approaching her brother, the groom, to ask him to not have dessert sent to her table and telling him all the backstory.  The groom counts in the do not approach the bride or groom rule.  OP could have just gone off and done something else until dessert was over, or found a kid who wanted an extra dessert or many many many other things than asking the person getting married to solve her problems.", "Nice of you to call my mom's alcoholism petty.  It was a serious problem, but not one I wanted to deal with on my wedding day.  Ana was playing stupid games - which is a serious problem, but not one that the groom should have had to deal with on his wedding day.  The OP approached her brother because she didn't want dessert delivered to her table, but that is not an issue you should ever have to take to the groom.  There are so many other ways to avoid the situation and could have approached her brother about the sabotage when they were back from the honeymoon.", "Bot.", "To be fair, it\u2019s not clear if the couple knew about OP\u2019s special arrangement with the caterer since OP approached his aunt directly and hasn\u2019t mentioned if/when he looped the bride and groom in. I\u2019m curious to know if they were aware of the arrangement.\n\nI don\u2019t think that commentator is criticising OP for having dietary restrictions. They seem to be pointing out that it is unusual to go straight to a caterer and not to involve the actual couple. It makes sense for OP to have done this himself, since it\u2019s his aunt and he has a good relationship with her, but it is still not the normal way it\u2019s done.", "But OP could've chopped things up and moved it around on her plate to blend in a bit more and make it look more plausible that she'd eaten some. I say, as someone who has done exactly that myself.", "I assumed it was kin.", "Oh 10000%", "Your point regarding the dessert is valid. At that point, what\u2019s done is done and damage control could have been handled better.\n\nStill holds that none of any of it would have happened if now-SIL had just minded her own business regarding OPs food concern.", "Are you the AH bride cause you are fighting so damn hard to find fault with OP?", "But they\u2019re damned if they do and damned if they don\u2019t. If they went to arrange it directly with their AUNT (not just any random caterer) then they did something weird by going behind the couples back. If they tried to organise it with the help of the couple it\u2019s making the day all about them and they need to grow up.", "Why would he have to or want to?\n\nHe has no obligation to put on some production so the host can pretend he is eating. They insulted him for having rules around food due to a medical condition, basically tried to force feed him and then blew up at him for not eating food he explicitly stated he would not eat.\n\nIf he were a vegan being served steak, is he also obligated to cut up the meat and move it around the plate?", "It is rather odd (but, like I explained before, understandable in this circumstance) to go directly to the wedding caterer. Normally there is a means for guests to notify the couple of any dietary restrictions (in my experience it\u2019s on the wedding invitation). Notifying the couple of this isn\u2019t \u2018making the day about him\u2019. I don\u2019t think it was an either/or situation. OP could have arranged this with his aunt but also involved the couple (it is their wedding and they are organising it, after all). There\u2019s no reason not to, dietary restrictions are normal and expected at weddings. Having said all that, it\u2019s not clear if he did/didn\u2019t tell them of his special arrangement."]}
