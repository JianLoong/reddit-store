This developed after eating some bad food on a cruise when I was 12.\n\nMy SIL, Ana, (25) and my brother (29) recently married. She's never had great food hygiene. No one else notices, but all I do is notice these things.\n\nI mostly eat vegan, it just reduces my anxiety and gives me a reason to decline food from people. \n\nMy aunties business was catering for the wedding; I asked to make a chicken dish specially for me. She's the only person I trust to make me food independently. She taught me food hygiene and helped me to trust meat (fish is out of the question, forever) again.\n\nMy brother was so proud of me when I said I would be eating with them, but Ana didn't really have a reaction. \n\nThe wedding:\nEveryone is seated and Ana's mother pushed out a food cart. She then gave a speech about how proud she was that Ana learnt the family recipe for the wedding (some paella dish).\n\nAfter, I subtly got her to speak with me in the hall. I asked her what was going on. She said this was a very important Spanish family tradition, that I need to grow up, stop eating like a toddler and embrace their culture. I spoke & she screamed at me that I was being a baby.\n\nI had several calls and a voicemail from my aunt. Ana had cancelled on her, at 11pm and her mother uninvited her to avoid drama. She only turned up to give Ana's mum my meal for her to put in the fridge. I looked for it - it was on the counter. Probably since morning. So I went back to my table and accepted that I'd cook later.\n\nSurprisingly, Ana's mum brings my meal, piping hot. She took great pleasure in seeming well-intentioned and made sure that my partner and the other guests at my table knew she lovingly cooked me this meal since I'm an awful picky eater. Of course I wasn't going to touch the plate. My partner noticed my discomfort with the food and took it away to ease my anxiety.\n\nI spoke to my brother and quietly explained the situation. I asked him to let the kitchen know I didn't need dessert. Ana overhead and started to cry silently and asked if I really don't trust her that much. I said at this moment, yes. Her crying was no longer silent. Her mother stepped in and blew everything up right at the head table.\n\nI apologised to my brother, then left quickly. He didn't deserve his day to be ruined any further. \n\nThe next week my brother invited me over. Ana said I ruined her wedding and I wasted her money since she still had to pay my auntie. She also said I ruined her wedding photos by looking gloomy with no food whilst everyone else was happy and eating. She pointed out the ONE problem photo where I was barely in the foreground, I have the worst rbf so sure, I may have looked gloomy.\n\nMy brother stayed neutral. But he said it was a bit of a dick move for me to chuck away my food. He said it would have been less embarrassing if I at least ate the vegetables furthest from the chicken. \n\nHis wording of that hurt. That he's essentially saying I embarrassed him at his wedding. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691921585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pv69f/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t ruin the wedding and you are absolutely alright in that you had a bad experience so you eat a certain way. But you should be prepared, I\u2019m deathly allergic to oranges, I touch one and I start the symptoms, put one in my mouth, off to the hospital I go, I always bring snacks or my own food in case soemthing has orange.  There were many ways to avoid all this. From both parties. \n\nI think you both suffer from \u201cmain character\u201d syndrome.", "YTA-I have dietary restrictions so I bring my own food or eat before/after. I was mostly on board with you until you went up to your brother, the groom, and said you didn\u2019t need dessert. I\u2019m not sure why you couldn\u2019t decline dessert when it was served. To top it off you told  the bride you didn\u2019t trust her much and made her cry. \n\nI kept having to scroll up to verify you\u2019re 21 and not 12. Even if you choose to not seek help for your phobia, you do need to grow up.", "[deleted]", "You didn't need to speak to the bride or groom at all about food yet you took time twice to speak to them both. Yes your food issues should be respected but if you are going to be that picky bring back ups. You need to just bring your own food, especially if you are not going to eat the specially prepared food someone does bring you. \nESH and I'm only voting that because you made such a big deal about it too both the bride and groom even after food was brought in especially for you.", "How does being Vegan help with this? Hope you are seeking therapy since all the papers I just read immersion therapy works best.\n\nNTA", "NTA - but why did you need to bring the situation to the groom's attention right then and there? It couldn't wait until later?", "ESH \n\nThey were mean-spirited and manipulative. \n\nYou made this such a drama before the wedding though. Why involve your aunt in a custom meal if you trust her cooking anyway? She was catering the wedding. Why did you need a specific dish? \n\nI get the feeling you do make this everyone\u2019s issue, and you unfortunately ran into people who (unkindly, dramatically) have had enough of you making it a focus.", "ESH your food issues should be your responsibility not everyone else\u2019s problem.", "ESH. I get phobias. I live with them daily. Not with this one but with others. But you both ignored boundaries. You both acted like the main character, and you both didn't handle it like grown woman. \n\nYour SIL is TA for trying to force you to eat something you don't feel comfortable with& starting drama afterward. And for not trying to understand that a phobia isn't a choice but an illness.\n \nYTA because you thought it would be appropriate to ask your aunt to make one special food only for you. Without talking to the bride&groom and getting their permission. They decide about the food, and if no one else is allowed to get special food, why should you? If you don't want to eat anything, that's should be accepted!! But you can't just decide that because you have a phobia you get special treatment without talking to the people whose wedding it is. Many people have anxiety, eating disorders, and struggle with textures, allergies, or anything like this. But I never heard from people deciding by themselves that they get a special food brought to a wedding.", "YTA\n\nYou need mental help about your phobia. You can't live this way and make this stress on everyone.", "NTA. Possibly NAH. \n\nI work in hospitality. Weddings are big emotional moments and are only complicated by logistics. \n\nYou seem to have don\u2019t everything right by showing up, being supportive, and politely/ subtly advocating for your unique needs. \n\nI completely understand why refusing cooking/ personal effort is rude and might get a brief outburst. Them continuing to push the issue would make them AH.", "I'm gonna roll with NTA purely because I assume you haven't learnt regardless of dietary requirements to *always* have backup food for a wedding. Something always goes awry, either the food is very late because everyone is making ridiculously long speeches or one dish is late so everyone descends on the vegetarian and vegan option leaving not enough for the folks who are actually veggie and vegan and then are full when the hog roast comes out. My best friend just got married and her family were so fucking precious about making sure vegan options would be available for my partner which honestly nearly made me cry but I still brought secret back up food because I didn't know if the venue would remember or if something would go wrong somehow. Is that probably overkill? Yeah. But in my experience always worth doing, especially if you do have dietary requirements. Also I do second what folks have said about therapy. This has stolen enough of your life. Your aunt sounds precious and your brothers new MIL sounds awful.", "The way you describe it, your SIL Ana is the a$$.\n\nI am surprised that your bother didn't do more to support you.  He should know about your emetophobia.\n\nWas he aware of how she changed the food at the last minute?\n\nPaella isn't for everyone.  If is made that  the way I have seen it made, there are mussels and / or clams.  I won't eat those.  It is not allergies, I don't like them.  \n\nNTA", "*auntie's", "NTA, i have emetophobia. \nYou\u2019re entitled to your bodily autonomy, and especially as an adult nobody should be able to force you to eat anything you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m glad your partner was understanding.", "NTA - you don't want to eat something then you don't have to. What children\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ESH", "NTA\n\nLike WTH?!\nWhat a drama family. I feel sorry for your brother ti be stuck with her.", "NTA. But I also blame the brother here. He is happy for his new wife to abuse both his sister and his aunt?! He's a total AH too.", "I will say that a golden rule of weddings is to never bother the groom or bride with your problems.  You should try your best to keep any and all drama as far away from the bride or groom as possible on that day - which means she should not have asked her brother to cancel her dessert. \n\n Yes - Ana was at fault and the asshole and clearly has some serious control issues, but the best thing to do would have been to just leave your food and go socialize with a relative or check your makeup or chat with the DJ until the meal was over.  Drama about it could have happened on a different day.  Heck, I probably would have scrolled through reddit on my phone in the coat room rather than brought Mt problems to the person getting married.  If anyone asks say you had acid reflux or something. \n\nI am still saying OP was NTA, but I really wish more people would follow this rule.  I think people think of it as 'they are throwing this party, they can fix it' but let them have peace on their wedding day.  SO many people brought issues to me on my wedding day - can I sit somewhere else and Uncle Steve said such and such and your mother is drinking, what should we do about it (my mother is an alcoholic and eight people must have come up to me about her drinking that night, like I was gonna drop everything and hold an intervention).", "I support this.", "Agreed. I don't think OP is an asshole but he is making his problem everyone elses problem more than would be needed. I dont judge but I can somewhat understand that an adult who's that picky about food is testing people's patience at times.", "Yep, this was an issue for the coordinator, point person, etc. to handle not the bride and groom. ESH.", "Thank god I'm not the only one thinking on this! \n\nCancelled and uninvited her husband's Aunt!!!\n\nThe night before she'd catered for a wedding. Of which she was family.\n\nAnd wtf with crying over someone else not eating a bowl of pre made  paella.", "Fear of vomiting.", "Fear of vomiting.", "The bride literally like shrieked at OP  for not eating the meal, I\u2019m not understanding how this isn\u2019t at last ESH in your eyes. OP says they were willing to accept they weren\u2019t going to eat, and while probably didn\u2019t have to let the kitchen know they weren\u2019t having dessert in earshot of the bride, but I don\u2019t think they were making it \u2018all about them\u2019 just having to deal with the prearranged accommodations being cancelled maliciously. To be honest I think it was the bride and the mother of the bride that made a huge drama out of the situation.", "But they didn't HAVE to at all. They forced this situation. They made it their problem.", "She did make arrangements with her aunt, who was catering the wedding. SIL decided to cancel her the night before the wedding and do something else.", "No. I refused to eat it because I knew it was left out, but she tried to serve it to me assuming I didn't know", "I agree but I also know some people just have no backbone when it comes to their SO. I feel like when that's the case it's more of a confidence or MH problem than being an AH", "Yep. People are responsible for who they subject the friends and family to. The fact that he was \u201cneutral\u201d but also said it was dickish and embarrassing behavior \u2014 yikes.", "This has stolen enough of your life. Your aunt sounds precious and your brothers new MIL sounds awful.", "This is a ludicrous line of questioning, OP is related to the caterer. Catering for special dietary requirements is a normal part of having a wedding, when I got married multiple people had different meals.", "I have emetophobia and I also dealt with an eating disorder. Often toxic dynamics can emerge where the obsession with whether the afflicted person eats or not becomes emblematic of the relationship and trust level different people have. People take others eating preferences very personally. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA because a phobia is a phobia and a wedding isn\u2019t the day to suddenly recover from a lifelong mental illness. They should have just accommodated you or let you not eat without making it a thing, and there\u2019d have been minimal drama - but OP from one emetophobe to another, you need to get yourself into some good good therapy.", "Sometimes the bride is the point person though....", "Her brother's new MIL made a big production of bringing out the meal her aunt made for her. You know the said same MIL who didn't bother to put it in the fridge? After all that, do you really think no one would have noticed she didn't eat it? Not buying that reasoning at all.", "OP did make accomodations for themselves prior to the event.  The bride just fucked up those accomodations by canceling catering last minute then leaving OP's meal on a counter for a whole day.", "Thank you.  Not sure why my question was downvoted; but I appreciate the clarification.", "It would never occur to some folks to demand a special separate meal for someone else's wedding, then call attention to themselves over it, especially over rejection of the bride's personal cuisine, moping all mournful through the event. It's surprising that anyone would be so presumptuous, in fact.\n\nDid the rest of the guests become ill with food poisoning?", "SIL is 100% cruel to uninvite the aunt. Surely not letting in outside food, which the venue probably has rules against, is enough?", "I understand that, that\u2019s why I said \u201cbe prepared\u201d you can\u2019t count on someone to be able to help watch out for yourself. I don\u2019t expect people to look out for my stuff so I just be safe, siblings, friends or anything. And ultimately at the end of the day, it\u2019s their wedding so if they choose to cancel, that\u2019s what they can do.", "I see what you mean. I read it incorrectly. Editing", "If Op had been my wedding guest, with dietary restrictions I'd have been thankful for her taking this into her own hands and giving me one less thing to think about, and I'dve been grateful to my soon to be aunt for dealing with it for no extra charge.", "This.", "So you think OP should have brought her own food, even though she made arrangements with the caterer? And who hires a caterer and then cancels them the night before the event, then complains about having to pay them? That makes no sense.", "No. My aunt owns the the business that they hired to cater for the wedding", "I feel like you\u2019re trying very hard to find wrongdoing on the OPs part. \n\nFrom the way the whole thing went down, there was no way that the OP could have avoided drama.", "I never said it made sense or that she is in the right for canceling and complaining and everything. If you read what I wrote, they both are ESH and yes, she should have brought something, if you are going to as picky as someone like OP is, you have to understand that people could choose not to make it, forget to, not have the ingredients, just like someone who is allergic,", "I agree with your except the caterer was HER AUNT, not some random person, so it wouldn't be expected that she'd forget or not prepare it. In fact, her aunt brought her food anyway, and SIL's mother decided to leave it out all morning so it wasn't edible. So while she didn't bring it herself, there was food there for her and they decided to ruin it for her and try to force her to eat food she can't eat."]}
