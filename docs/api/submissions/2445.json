We have lived together for just over a year & have been dating for 3. His mom relapsed with cancer 6 months into our relationship & after a few more months he essentially became homeless since he has no siblings nor a father & couldn't continue to pay $1500 rent plus bills & food. He ended up staying with me at my old place that I shared with roommates for another 4 months or so until we had to get our own place together as I didn't want to be that person who has their bf move in when there's roommates involved. \n\nOne month after we moved in together, his mom passed away. Like I said he doesn't have siblings & the rest of his family aren't good people, so he essentially lost the only person that ever really loved him. This was devastating as you can imagine & since we are young it made him spiral into a depression even more so. Since dealing with this loss he had struggled to work & thus there are many bills that have fallen behind. I've been trying to pick up the slack but can only do so much as neither one of us make good money since I'm barely getting started into my career after college & he works retail & hadn't finished college due to covid. \n\nLet me also say we both have a history with mental illness & my bf is also ADHD as well. I've been barely keeping us afloat for the past year since his mother passed. I'm stressed beyond belief from debt collector calls, medical bills from personal psychiatric appointments, etc. I told him it's hard for me not to resent how his lack of working has made us this way to the point where we are in serious debt but he thinks I'm just being an AH for not understanding his grief, tho I've been sympathetic for a whole year. He has been started to pick up more slack now that I've told him that I'm at my breaking point and we need this sorted out. He says we will get out of this in due time but I told him it still doesn't make me feel less depressed that we are in this financial hole in the first place & that my credit score is tanked.

You and your bf both need social services help, for whatever you may qualify for.  With that said, you are both drowning and if you don't save yourself he will take you down with him.  You need to extricate yourself from the situation, focus on your needs, and if your bf can pull himself out then it's something you can explore in a new relationship.  He's going to expect you to take care of him and yourself, instead of taking him making himself a priority like you should.", "NTA. At least as I read it. He hasn't worked for a year? It is waaay past time for him to have figured out how to help support himself. You should not have had to shoulder the financial burden for both of you for a whole year.", "NTA. As sad as it is, a death in the family doesn\u2019t stop the rest of the world from turning and doesn\u2019t excuse you from all of your responsibilities for a year. He\u2019s not taking responsibility for his own life and needs to learn how to handle his grief. \n\nMy only advice for the future is to address issues when they\u2019re not a huge deal yet and don\u2019t let them get to a breaking point if you can help it.", "NAH - You've done all you can and should be applauded. You are not TA for telling him after this long that you can't keep supporting him and he needs to be there for you now.\n\nHe isn't TA for having a difficult time with the passing of his mother. Even after this long, grief can sting and make you feel like you can't move on.\n\nIf he continues to pick up, then NAH. He will be TA if he does not take steps to deal with his mental health and contribute equally to the household.\n\nLosing a parent is devastating, but life does go on and he may need this ultimatum to motivate him to make the change he needs.", "NAH\n\nsounds like both of you are having a hard time, and having perfectly normal responses to an awful situation. \n\nalso sounds like he\u2019s finally starting to move on from a grieving process. so hopefully things will get better now. hang in there", "NAH. Grief can and often does cause depression, but so does prolonged financial stress and seeing your credit score crash, as you have experienced. It was good of you to carry him, but that burden gets to be emotionally exhausting. I hope he's been getting therapy. \n\nSit down with him and develop a plan together to pay off your debts. He literally owes you, so hopefully he'll be able to gradually pay you back. It may help to sit down with a financial advisor. Some banks and credit unions offer this service, so maybe check there. \n\nHe's very fortunate to have you. However, you both need to recognize that being someone's only source of love and support puts a lot of pressure on you. It's hard to be someone's one and only everything. Some families are born, and some are made. Hopefully, he'll be able to make a new \"family\" of close and loving friends..and you, of course.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but everyday people that are sad and have lost someone get up and go to work because they have to.\n\nYour bf needs to start working.  And it maybe time for him to go live with roommates and you need to go back and get some roomates too.   The truth is neither of you can afford your own place.  \n\nYou also need to quit financing everything.  Let the cupboards go empty turn off the cable and don't pay for his cell phone if you are.   Until he feels the pinch, sees the pinch, and the pinch slaps him in the face, he doesn't have to deal with any of it. \n\n do not pay any of his bills.", "NTA. While there is no set time for grief, nor should there be, a year is a long time if your life is falling apart. It does sound like he is recovering and that you both are communicating with each other, which is a big positive.", "NTA. The death of a parent is hard. I lost my mom at 21, my brother at 24, and my dad at 27. I'm 28 now. It still hurts like hell everyday knowing that I'll never see them again. But life moves on. I'm been very depressed and after mom died I started having very bad panic attacks, heart beating super fast and I choke on my own breath. But life goes on. I still work everyday. Other than the short leave from work to deal with funerals and what not, I've still worked 5 days a week, every week. No vacations. He has to pull himself together and be strong. His mom wouldn't want him to suffer the way he is.", "NAH. You were as supportive as you could be, and he's doing what he can and starting to do more. Hang in there and keep the lines of communication open as you have been.", "NTA. \n\nIt's understandable for him to feel like that. But, at some point he's gotta get his life back on track. It's disheartening to hear that she was the only person in his life that he loved (aside from you, of course), but now he's got you. Being depressed and grieving can bring you down. But, you gotta fight through it. I've had depression and anger issues in the past. As much as I didn't want to get up and go to work and do what I had to do I still did it. I wasn't grieving, but still, life and responsibilities don't stop just because a loved one passed away.", "I don't even know where to start with this. First you are talking about someone getting cancer and not an addiction so try not to call it a relapse. \n\nI get your frustration with the debt but everyone grieves differently. There is no time frame for it. One moment you can be fine and a year later it can all of a sudden hit.\n\nCan I ask how you were helping besides financially in that year? Was he going to therapy himself? Was there not some sort of government assistance he could have been getting to help?\n\nBy the sounds of this unless this is dating way back this all happened while the world was kinda shut down and just starting to open back up. So not only did his mother die the woman that gave him life, the only family member he ever had a connection with and cared about half the world was depressed and not knowing how they were getting through.\n\nI feel like you could have approached it differently but it came out the way it did. Hes back to work now and picking up the slack so whats the problem. Your biggest concern about this is that you are now in debt and your credit is tanked. All things that can be fixed he can't get his mom back. If you are going to hold onto that you are going to make him resent you.\n\nTry and focus on the positive that he is coming out of his depression and working more and helping out. Try and move forward.", "NTA a year is WAY more than you should be expected to handle. Heck 4 months would have been more than you should have handled on your own. He needs to figure something out and pull his weight not give the non answer of oh it'll work out.", "NTA. When grief takes hold, it can difficult to see and think clearly. And as responsibilities, bills, and other relationships fall into that ever increasing stressful pit, it feels easier in the moment to pretend there are no issues, because dealing with issues means thinking and feeling. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve been giving him a roof over his head and giving him the necessary comfort, but, coming from someone whose been in that awful pit before, he really needs a stable way to deal with more than just his portion of the rent/personal bills. My husband really helped me by setting up a specific task at a time to get done within a certain period. He\u2019d check in, make sure my anxiety was managed enough to get it done and that I didn\u2019t get forget. We also set up a budget and figured out what we each needed to contribute to the bills, groceries and gas to survive, what we could contribute to self money, fun money, and emergency/saving money. We made those things strict, and having that kind of stability actually helped me get out of my funk little by little. If your boyfriend needs to pick up more hours at his job or can pick up an extra job that\u2019s even only a couple days a week, that can go towards groceries and gas. That\u2019s a start, and will take a little of the load off you. \n\nI suggest figuring out a budget or a strict plan in a way that drives the point that it\u2019s for both you. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this together, for us, and this will help us live better and feel better. Something needs to change and in six months, we\u2019ll take a look at where we\u2019re at, and adjust accordingly if we need to.\u201d", "NTA. It's a really sad situation for your boyfriend, but if I understand it correctly, all you're asking is for him to contribute more financially by working additional shifts since you both have bills and debts that you can't cover yourself. That's a beyond reasonable request especially now that it's been a year. It'd be different if you were asking him to \"cheer up!\" or to act a certain way he's not ready for; you're literally trying to keep yourselves financially afloat. \n\nI hope your boyfriend, though still grieving, appreciates how much you have supported him this past year. If he didn't have you to pay for the other half of rent as well as all other bills, he wouldn't have had the freedom to work less and would've been in an even worse situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I loved my Mom more than anything, and she and I were actually living together, so every day we spent time together and we were very close. To this day I think that one day we will meet again, and I sincerely look forward to the time I can be with her again.\n\nGrief is different for everyone, when my Mom died fairly suddenly I didn't have the luxury of having someone cover my bills for me. I had family, but all of us had bills. We had to go to work. I was in physical pain the grief was so all consuming. My chest hurt so bad. I would hear a song in the car that reminded me of her, and break down in tears. I still had to work.\n\nWork did take my mind off my grief for hours at a time, eventually it got better. There are parents who lose children, and don't have the luxury of taking months off to grieve. Is there a possibility that you are enabling him? What was his work ethic like before? There are free support groups for bereavement, has he sought any help?\n\nIt sounds like he is not a go getter in life and you don't want to tie yourself to someone who is unwilling or unable to carry his own weight.
