My parents divorced when I was 13, at the time she told everyone it was because my dad had made too many poor financial decisions, but the reality was that she left him for a work colleague. Both remarried, my stepmother is lovely, my stepfather however is very indulgent of my mother, and often joins in her controlling behaviour. The final straw was my mother telling lies about my wife and MIL and causing an argument between us, then trying to convince me to leave her while I was still upset about it. She wanted me to move closer to her, and bring my 5yo son, leaving my 3yo daughter with my wife. Once I found out she had lied, I mended things with my wife, and politely (but firmly) asked my mother and stepfather not to contact me any more, not to visit, and that she wouldn't be allowed to see my kids any more. I kept an open line with my stepfather in case any of my elderly relatives became ill or passed away. Her response was to tell me how ashamed of me my recently deceased grandfather would be, as well as an essay of other unpleasant accusations. Fast forward 12 months of the best mental health I have ever experienced, despite an objectively very difficult year. My mother sent me a seemingly innocent message in an attempt to play on my emotions and get me to reach out to her. My father in law (who is nearly at the end of a 3 year battle with spinal cancer) had just been taken into hospital so I ignored the message. A month later she re-sent the same message over email. I replied to my stepfather and asked him to remind her of my request not to contact me. The reply was an essay describing 1)The immense support my brothers had given her during a difficult medical diagnosis (that nobody had told me about) 2) instructing me to either \"make certain changes\" or stop contacting them (despite that my only contact in 12 months was to ask her not to contact me). In the message she also accused me of being controlling and trying to dictate her behaviour, despite my insistence that all I wanted was to be left alone. They also decided to call in a sum of money given to me over 10 years ago, and a family \"heirloom\" ring given to me for my daughter to inherit. I offered to repay the money in small installments (they go on 2 cruises a year) and refused to give the ring back. Both were gifts freely given. I haven't been personal, unpleasant or even impolite, I'm simply refusing to engage in their dialogue, most of which is based on fantasy and all of which (I feel) is an attempt to resume the emotional manipulation I encountered in the previous 30 years. I have no ill feeling towards either of them, I simply want to leave them to leave me alone, I just want to live my life without them in it.
