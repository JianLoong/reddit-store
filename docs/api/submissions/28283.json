Why was a baby in the lazy river?  Where the heck were the park employees?\n\nNo, no you do not get yourself out of your tube - you're not supposed to be out of the tube in the lazy river.  You really don't have control over where you're going.  You'll bump.  Everyone else is supposed to be...in tubes.  Barring an accident, which the park should be prepared to respond to.", "NTA.

If they seem like a rational/calm individual who just doesn't understand how it works you can educate them.

If you are walking in it then you need to suck up getting bumped by tubes or move faster to try to avoid them. Either way you weren't in the wrong and there was really nothing you could do about it. You were using it correctly and she wasn't, so she's at fault here.", "NTA.  If she is that uncertain of her ability to hold a baby while being bumped, she either should not be in the river or should have a tube too so there is a barrier between her and other tubers.

They are meant to be used exactly as you said.", "There is nothing you could do. The current and other tubes just push you sometimes, and they have a life of their own. Every experienced river person knows this. Sometimes, you get bumped. It is sheer madness to walk with a baby. It's so hard to control tubes, rafts, kayaks, canoes, and other people, even with minimal current.\n\nIt's not like you aimed for her like you were river bowling or something.  NTA", "NTA.

It\u2019s my responsibility to fend for myself there. \n\nI\u2019ve taken my nephew on a lazy river when he was 1, and I did NOT walk with him without a tube for this exact reason.

You don\u2019t go in the lazy river, unless you\u2019re in a tube. The lifeguards should have yelled at her. You can\u2019t control where you go or how fast.

Sounds entitled.", "NTA.  The whole point of the Lazy River is to relax IN A TUBE.   She was an idiot for walking through with a damn baby.   That's an accident waiting to happen because she was was reckless.   Don't feel bad about it,   it's on her.", "NTA - you don't have total control unless your feet are on the ground in a lazy river. You are correct, that is how a lazy River operates.\n\nIf anything, she's the AH for carrying a baby in a lazy river where people don't have full control. She should have held it on the side of the pool or in a chair.", "NTA.  She shouldn't have a baby with her if she's going to stand/walk in a lazy river.", "NTA\n\nYou had no control. She was walking in the river with the baby.", "NTA, but couldn't you have warned her ahead of time?", "NTA \n\nI took my 6 month old into a lazy river but she was in her own baby inflatable ring and I was acting as an extra guard around her in case people\u2019s rings bumped into her because it\u2019s a lazy river and that\u2019s what happens. I spent my trip around apologising to those that bumped into me in case they felt I was in their way. \n\nThat mum was out of line and totally on another planet IMHO\n\nEdit - no one seemed bothered that I was there with a baby as I was keeping her safe and keeping out of everyone\u2019s way.

Especially considering this was absolutely the mothers fault.", "NTA, most people using a lazy river are going to be in a tube (even if it\u2019s not a requirement to use one in the lazy river) so if you\u2019re not in one you have to suck it up and expect to be bumped a couple times. Even more so if you\u2019re just standing around. Lazy rivers can be good to help sooth babies but at the end of the day it\u2019s still an attraction for everyone to use so again be prepared to be bumped and for there to be other people.
