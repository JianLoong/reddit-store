Your parents are the ones creating an unhealthy family dynamic, not you. Are you failing classes? If it's a case of some Bs and Cs post your report card and this whole thing on facebook/whatever social media your parents use, put their asses on blast. Is your sister aware of the situation? If you can get her to back you up on this it'll be pretty hard for your parents to deny.\n\nYour parents are playing a favorites to a disgusting degree, and they know that they will look bad if people find out. If this kind of thing happens in the future, go to the party and stir the pot as much as possible and go for maximum pity points.\n\nNTA, btw", "NTA\n\nI worked and volunteer in Education. You need to speak to a trusted adult at school. Your parents attitude is not helpful. If you are trying your parents attitude and the pressure from them is not only not going to improve your grades it\u2019s likely to make things worse. It\u2019s damaging to your self esteem and mental health. Your parents can\u2019t punish you into a genius. I have seen some horrible consequences of this kind of parental attitude over the years. Sounds like your parents need reality check from a educational professional. Not everyone has the same academic prowess even between identical twins let alone fraternal ones (you don\u2019t say which you are) \n\nIf you are struggling at school things to consider\n\n1. There are different kinds of smart.\n2. Consider what you are struggling with, you may have a low level SEN 40% of people do have various levels of SEN (special educational need) from the very sever to the very minor and if that\u2019s the case for you there maybe strategies to make your study more effective. \n3. Academic smarts are not all that is required for success in life\n4. Everyone has something they shine at you just need to find yours.\n\nAGAIN PLEASE PLEASE OP SPEAK TO A TRUSTED ADULT AT SCHOOL. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS IMPORTANT AND MORE VULNERABLE AS A TEEN.\n\nEdit\u2026..I would let it accidentally come out to your most gossipy relative what actually happened and the fact your now grounded because they felt the need to lie about their actions. The truth is if the felt it necessary to lie about what they did they know they are wrong.", "NTA \n\nIt was seriously a shitty thing for them to do to you.

Because their behavior is not OK", "So, if you DID go, did your parents think your relatives, who have known you for 16 years, wouldn't bring a gift for you? Or wish you both a happy birthday? Or wonder why the cake only had Sister's name on it?\n\nYour not being there plus the decent excuse of hanging with your friends would be far less embarrassing for your parents than all of the above. \n\nDo your parents think your family doesn't know what TWINS are? Or that they're fricking stupid?\n\nAnd NTA", "NTA.  Healthy families wouldn't do what your parents did. There is a reason your parents lied to your relatives and it is because they knew they would be judge negatively for what they did.  Yes there should be some kind of consequences for not doing well in school, but not getting to celebrate your birthday while allowing your twin sister to have a party on the same day is a really twisted form of punishment. Your parents have no idea what healthy families do.", "NTA, your sister, who this party is for, seems to know you care about her. The only people bothered are the parents. Assuming you are trying at school, this isn\u2019t a reasonable thing to punish you for. It isn\u2019t your fault at all that you\u2019ve been struggling in class, that just happens sometimes. This seems weird and vindictive. Also, what were they going to tell family if you did come, and didn\u2019t get cake/presents? You made a very reasonable choice, and I hope you had a good time. Your parents made their bed and now they have to lie in it.", "NTA. You approached the issue in mature and reasonable manner. You insured that your sister knows you love her. You even warned your parents. I do not see what else you could have done.  I do have one question though: Your parents did not think the relatives would notice that your parents celebrating only your sister's b-day and not yours. Wouldn't it create more questions. The only answer I can find is that your parents expected the question to be asked and were planning to answer that you are not getting b-day because of your grades which is an A move..", "NTA but also did none of the relatives get you anything?", "NTA. You told them you weren\u2019t going and made sure your twin knew what the deal was. Your parents seemed to be mad that they were embarrassed and had to answer questions about your absence.

In a \"healthy family\" parents don't punish a child who is legitimately trying their hardest, and they certainly don't punish by taking away a birthday celebration. They even KNOW what they did was wrong because they lied (albeit by omission) to others about it.", "NTA. \nI am applaud by your parents behaviour.\n\n1) You never ever punish a child that has done their best. Never. I have 4 children and embrace them being individuals with different strengths and weaknesses. If they do their best, they deserve praise regardless if one did better in school. \n\n2) A birthday is a celebration of this person being born, being in your life. It day where you tell them. Not by buying expensive gifts, but by showing love and appreciation. Any child need to be shown love. Even if they do something wrong. Which you didn\u2019t. \n\n3) I praise you for giving your sister a gift and showing her that you love her, and telling her why you didn\u2019t come.  \n\n4) They shouldn\u2019t blame you for not trying to solve it, because you did. You tried to speak to them. They did not take you seriously. Their fault. \n\n5) Their explanation to the family: They didn\u2019t tell why you chose this. They left out their part of it, because that would be embarrassing because they were wrong and scared to be called out on it.\n\nPlease continue to be a loving person in spite of your parents. I hope you and your sister will keep close.", "NTA\n\nYour parents were planning to shame you publicly at your sister's birthday party.  But surely your  relatives would have assumed it was a joint birthday party anyway?  Surely they brought a present for you as well and added your name when they sang Happy Birthday.\n\nSo really you absenting yourself made sure that the party was focussed on your sister.\n\nI'm sorry your parents are creating such an unhealthy family, rather than getting you tutoring or altering your education to suit your needs. Contact your relatives and tell them what actually happened, that you were expected to attend your sister's party as a punishment for not achieving academically to their standards.\n\nEdit: from reading some of OPs comments.  The extended family is pretty screwed up if they didn't bring a present for you because it's also your birthday.  I'd still talk to your relatives about this because shame is not going to make your grades match your sister's. Also if your sister was truly neutral she should have declined to have a party. I hope she got you a present and is helping you with your school work. Sounds like she's pretty competitive and quite pleased that she's coming out on top academically.", "Nta. If I were your twin sister, I would refuse to have a birthday party without you. You have been sharing everyhing since being procreated.

LIKE WHAT?!\n\nThey made up a lie to make themselves look good in everyones eyes! As long as you are trying in school that should be all that matters to them. Some people learn in different ways, I wasn't the best at showing up to class but aced all my tests, and that was a hard thing for my mom to wrap her head around, but she never denied me celebrating my birthday!\n\nI am so sorry that you have to go through this, it's almost like they are comparing you to one another and that's not okay either. \n\nHappy birthday/belated birthday and I hope that you realize that's not a healthy environment.", "NTA. Your parents are being unfair to you, leaving you out of the birthday party and expecting you to be ok with that. At the very least, they could've gotten something for you.

What they're doing is really unacceptable.\n\nYour sister is an AH for letting them do this to you. If she sided with you and say she wouldn't accept to have a party if you're not getting one as well, your parents would have had no chance but to give in as she's apparently their golden child.\n\nYou only very slightly are the AH for deciding to use your sister's party for this protest which indeed negatively affected her.

I do writing workshops in schools, and so often a teacher will say, 'I never realised X had such an imagination/great ideas/abilty at Y' because they've already made their minds up about the kid and never give them a chance", "Then go public...", "Right! I get working with kids is hard but treating them like people goes a long way.", "It probably isn't going to get DHS to step in and throw your parents in jail, but yes, what you're describing is abuse. Your parents may or may not even realize it. Most likely they grew up with a similar situation and this seems \"normal\" to them. \n\nWhole family needs therapy, but if they won't get it, talk to your counselor at school about how to get it yourself. These are unhealthy patterns that the sooner you learn how to overcome them, the less likely you are to repeat them with your own kids down the road. \n\nI was in my late 20s, divorced (and remarried), with 2 kids before I came to really understand that I grew up in an abusive home with an abusive parent and an abuse-enabling parent. I was probably in my mid-30s with teenagers before I came to understand how many of my parenting habits were unhealthy due to the way I was brought up. Don't let it go that long for you. Take care of yourself. \n\nAlso, the abuse hurts your sister too, even if she's the \"golden child\" in the sibling pair. It may even harm her more than it harms you.", "It's not just the birthday party though, is it? It's not like they flipped a light switch and turned off your birthday. They systematically went out of their way to isolate you and keep you feeling indebted and subservient and anxiously waiting and hoping that they don't do something worse.\n\nA lot of people don't celebrate their birthdays and it has nothing to do with abuse.\n\nBut I've never seen anyone but an abusive person treat someone the way your parents have treated you. It's not about the birthday. It's about everything else.\n\nEmotional abuse is abuse.", "Not in itself perhaps but you do sound like a victim of abuse. You sound absolutely resigned to \u2018punishment\u2019 no matter what you o. There\u2019s a quality to your replies that makes me think of a dog that cringes because its owner is going to kick it no matter what it does.\n\nIf that\u2019s your life then yeah, you\u2019re being abused.", "It is abuse when it\u2019s part of a wider pattern of behaviour. \n\nLet\u2019s consider \n\n1. Parents ride OP because she is unable to meet their (for her) unrealistic expectations.\n\n2. They punish her for not achieving them by giving her twin a party but not her. Had time to rethink that but didn\u2019t \n\n3. Obviously realised they went to far because they felt the need to lie to relatives\n\n4. They then grounded OP because they lied\n\n5. OP sounds like they are afraid of their parents to the point they don\u2019t want to admit what\u2019s happening at home\n\n\nAbuse is not just physical injuries. It is anything that damages someone emotionally mentally or physically.", "Sounds like you should just tell your family the truth. You are already grounded and they already didn't let you have a birthday party. Spill the tea.", "NTA. This is not healthy behaviour from your parents. They were embarrassed in front of family... because they are the AH. I am so sorry to you and your sister (who they also involved for reasons that are beyond me). Its a sad day when a 16yo reasoning, empathy and kindness, exceeds that of their parents. Be proud of yourself.\n\nI hope you had a great night out with your friends and celebrated yourself. Happy Birthday!! x", "NTA. Tell your relatives the real reason.", "NTA your parents sound like they suck \ud83d\ude1e sorry kiddo \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nI feel bad after reading OP's comments too cuz there's no one they can depend on", "NTA your parents are picking favorites and they know it's wrong because your relatives saw you were gone and they figured out the reason pretty quick humans hate being judged public. Shame is the greatest weapon ever\nIn about 2 years your parents are going to be wondering why you up and just cut contact with them if they do just refer them to your 16th. Not birthday I feel bad for your sister, she wanted you there and your parents are playing favorites", ">Got home late at night and my parents told me my absence was noticed by relatives and they were embarrassed.\n\nWell, wouldn't they have noticed anyways if one twin has a party and the other doesn't?  Their logic doesn't resemble our earth logic...", "If they are too embarrassed to tell the truth then they should re-evaluate their actions. If you\u2019re feeling petty reach out to your family to fill in the blanks. Saying \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable by my family having a warped perception of me because they are missing all the details. If me telling my family the truth is an issue I think this is a broader issue we should discuss with a therapist.\u201d", "NTA, you might want to follow up with your sister to make sure she isn't disappointed or thinking it's her fault you weren't there, just for the sake of making double sure she's fine with it. Then, next time your parents bring it up, you need to tell them that you told her ahead of time and talked to her again after it all blew over and she's still okay with what happened. Tell them you guys are twins and if they want to avoid being embarrassed by your absence, don't pull this stunt again (I know you would have to say it in a nicer way than me). You aren't responsible for how they feel, and the person they threw the party for was okay with your absence.\n\n\"Your claims of being upset that I wasn't there to support my sister are bs because she knew ahead of time I wouldn't be there and was fine with it. Please stop acting like you are upset on behalf of my sister. She is not upset about this now and was never upset about it to begin with.\" Tell them that, in your own less harsh words. They're using your sister as a scapegoat reason to be mad at you. Tell them to leave her out of it, and that they are risking driving a wedge between your sister and yourself by treating you both this way (this is honestly true, your parents doing this could cause issues between you two in the future, even though you made it clear that you both know it's not either of your fault).\n\nI'm glad to hear your sister is staying out of it but still understands you, things might be tough now but later in life you can both ignore your parents and your sibling relationship will probably be closer than ever.", "NTA, in a healthy functional family you don't punish someone for slightly less than stellar grades. Your parents are ridiculous.", "WTF wtf wtf wtf wtf.", "I honestly don't understand this idea of punishing a kid for not getting good enough grades. First of all, people are born with different abilities and talents. You can try your best and still not get it. Second, things can happen in a kid's life to make them fall behind in school - bullying, having a bad relationship with a teacher, mental health issues, etc. Third, if a kid is struggling, the kid might not tell their parents and ask for help, if they know they are expected to get perfect grades. They maybe even think it's better to cheat or that it doesn't matter if they get a C or fail, so why even try? And finally, it punishes kids that are disabled or neurodivergent unfairly.\n\nAlso, punishing someone by not celebrating their birthday is cruel. I've seen posts here about parents cancelling big celebrations because the child had acted mean to someone, which I understand, but don't cancel their birthday just for a minor screw-up.\n\nAnd in this case, with twins, there's a big risk of creating sibling rivalry or making them hate each other by celebrating one's birthday and not the other one's.", "Do you have failing grades at the moment, or leading up to the party?", "this comes to fuck around and find out. your parents can make your life miserable, but all they really care about is everyone else thinks they are good parents. you have the power to destroy that. you and your sister both. never forget that. they only care about what others think and you will be free to do your best without them one day. I'm sorry you are going through this", "That's where I'm ao confused. If OP had been present, wouldn't it add even more questions.\n\n\"OH this party is just for our daughter. OP simply isn't doing well enough in school to celebrate their continued existence.\"\n\nI am definitely speculating here but... I think their extended family is complicit. Their absence shows a lack of familial support to their sister but their presence brings up too many questions about why the party is just for sister, unless they'd be cool with that.", "there are different kinds of abuse. and honestly you saying that is basically the exact thing thats said by alot of kids ( and sometimes adults) who are in a relationship ( familial or otherwise) with an abuser. \n\nalso as someone who did have one of those much worse parents ( parent was jailed for some of what they did to me) i can tell you that the stuff that still effects me the most is the kinda stuff your parents seem to be doing. \n\n\njust because someone else is going through shit doesnt mean what you are going through is chocolate pudding", "Thank you. My English is a bit rusty.", "Your parents are abusive assholes. You don't live in a \"healthy family\". I hope you can cut them off when you are 18.", "I wonder how the parents thought it would go if OP did attend. OP not attending was probably the best case scenario. If OP did attend, all the relatives would see that the party was not ment for him/her.", "In my area, 83 is a C. B ends at 85. I generally got in trouble when any grade dropped below ~88/a high B. \n\nAnd yeah, I did need a scholarship to be able to go to college. Which i did get so I could go, so complaining about her methods always feels a little dirty.", "Your grandparents could. Shame is a motivator for people like your parents, they didn't even want to tell them the real reason why you weren't there."]}
