Your parents are the ones creating an unhealthy family dynamic, not you. Are you failing classes? If it's a case of some Bs and Cs post your report card and this whole thing on facebook/whatever social media your parents use, put their asses on blast. Is your sister aware of the situation? If you can get her to back you up on this it'll be pretty hard for your parents to deny.\n\nYour parents are playing a favorites to a disgusting degree, and they know that they will look bad if people find out. If this kind of thing happens in the future, go to the party and stir the pot as much as possible and go for maximum pity points.\n\nNTA, btw", "NTA\n\nI worked and volunteer in Education. You need to speak to a trusted adult at school. Your parents attitude is not helpful. If you are trying your parents attitude and the pressure from them is not only not going to improve your grades it\u2019s likely to make things worse. It\u2019s damaging to your self esteem and mental health. Your parents can\u2019t punish you into a genius. I have seen some horrible consequences of this kind of parental attitude over the years. Sounds like your parents need reality check from a educational professional. Not everyone has the same academic prowess even between identical twins let alone fraternal ones (you don\u2019t say which you are) \n\nIf you are struggling at school things to consider\n\n1. There are different kinds of smart.\n2. Consider what you are struggling with, you may have a low level SEN 40% of people do have various levels of SEN (special educational need) from the very sever to the very minor and if that\u2019s the case for you there maybe strategies to make your study more effective. \n3. Academic smarts are not all that is required for success in life\n4. Everyone has something they shine at you just need to find yours.\n\nAGAIN PLEASE PLEASE OP SPEAK TO A TRUSTED ADULT AT SCHOOL. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS IMPORTANT AND MORE VULNERABLE AS A TEEN.", "NTA \n\nIt was seriously a shitty thing for them to do to you. I don\u2019t know if they make your sister the golden child and you the scapegoat in punish you for things but I would tell your relatives exactly the reason you weren\u2019t there. Because their behavior is not OK", "So, if you DID go, did your parents think your relatives, who have known you for 16 years, wouldn't bring a gift for you? Or wish you both a happy birthday? Or wonder why the cake only had Sister's name on it?\n\nYour not being there plus the decent excuse of hanging with your friends would be far less embarrassing for your parents than all of the above. \n\nDo your parents think your family doesn't know what TWINS are? Or that they're fricking stupid?\n\nAnd NTA", "NTA.  Healthy families wouldn't do what your parents did. There is a reason your parents lied to your relatives and it is because they knew they would be judge negatively for what they did.  Yes there should be some kind of consequences for not doing well in school, but not getting to celebrate your birthday while allowing your twin sister to have a party on the same day is a really twisted form of punishment. Your parents have no idea what healthy families do.", "NTA, your sister, who this party is for, seems to know you care about her. The only people bothered are the parents. Assuming you are trying at school, this isn\u2019t a reasonable thing to punish you for. It isn\u2019t your fault at all that you\u2019ve been struggling in class, that just happens sometimes. This seems weird and vindictive. Also, what were they going to tell family if you did come, and didn\u2019t get cake/presents? You made a very reasonable choice, and I hope you had a good time. Your parents made their bed and now they have to lie in it.", "NTA. You approached the issue in mature and reasonable manner. You insured that your sister knows you love her. You even warned your parents. I do not see what else you could have done.  I do have one question though: Your parents did not think the relatives would notice that your parents celebrating only your sister's b-day and not yours. Wouldn't it create more questions. The only answer I can find is that your parents expected the question to be asked and were planning to answer that you are not getting b-day because of your grades which is an A move..", "NTA but also did none of the relatives get you anything?", "NTA. You told them you weren\u2019t going and made sure your twin knew what the deal was. Your parents seemed to be mad that they were embarrassed and had to answer questions about your absence. That\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA. Your sister is the golden child and you aren't required to feed into it.", "NTA. In a \"healthy family\" parents don't punish a child who is legitimately trying their hardest, and they certainly don't punish by taking away a birthday celebration. They even KNOW what they did was wrong because they lied (albeit by omission) to others about it.", "NTA. \nI am applaud by your parents behaviour.\n\n1) You never ever punish a child that has done their best. Never. I have 4 children and embrace them being individuals with different strengths and weaknesses. If they do their best, they deserve praise regardless if one did better in school. \n\n2) A birthday is a celebration of this person being born, being in your life. It day where you tell them. Not by buying expensive gifts, but by showing love and appreciation. Any child need to be shown love. Even if they do something wrong. Which you didn\u2019t. \n\n3) I praise you for giving your sister a gift and showing her that you love her, and telling her why you didn\u2019t come.  \n\n4) They shouldn\u2019t blame you for not trying to solve it, because you did. You tried to speak to them. They did not take you seriously. Their fault. \n\n5) Their explanation to the family: They didn\u2019t tell why you chose this. They left out their part of it, because that would be embarrassing because they were wrong and scared to be called out on it.\n\nPlease continue to be a loving person in spite of your parents. I hope you and your sister will keep close.", "NTA\n\nYour parents were planning to shame you publicly at your sister's birthday party.  But surely your  relatives would have assumed it was a joint birthday party anyway?  Surely they brought a present for you as well and added your name when they sang Happy Birthday.\n\nSo really you absenting yourself made sure that the party was focussed on your sister.\n\nI'm sorry your parents are creating such an unhealthy family, rather than getting you tutoring or altering your education to suit your needs. Contact your relatives and tell them what actually happened, that you were expected to attend your sister's party as a punishment for not achieving academically to their standards.\n\nEdit: from reading some of OPs comments.  The extended family is pretty screwed up if they didn't bring a present for you because it's also your birthday.  I'd still talk to your relatives about this because shame is not going to make your grades match your sister's. Also if your sister was truly neutral she should have declined to have a party. I hope she got you a present and is helping you with your school work. Sounds like she's pretty competitive and quite pleased that she's coming out on top academically.", "Nta. If I were your twin sister, I would refuse to have a birthday party without you. You have been sharing everyhing since being procreated. Also choosing favorites among kids by their scholar ranking is gross. I would love my child either way, not all kids are a+ worthy.\nYou were more than decent and nice. Like someone else said, put them in a nursing home when the time comes\ud83d\ude05", "NTA, they had a party for your twin and you were even gonna be honoured at it. It's your birthday too. How were they gonna explain having a party for your twin and not even acknowdging it's your birthday as well?", "Nta\n\nThey weren't throwing you a birthday party, so you threw one for yourself. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "NTA as a fellow twin I find your parent's treatment to be pretty abhorrent. Good for you for not playing their game.", "NTA. Put them in a nursing home.", "NTA, you gave your sister a gift ahead of time and told her why you were doing what you were doing.\n\nYour family sounds a little toxic, they sound a bit like the family that is all about keeping up appearances, you not getting good enough grades should never be a reason to not celebrate your birthday?! LIKE WHAT?!\n\nThey made up a lie to make themselves look good in everyones eyes! As long as you are trying in school that should be all that matters to them. Some people learn in different ways, I wasn't the best at showing up to class but aced all my tests, and that was a hard thing for my mom to wrap her head around, but she never denied me celebrating my birthday!\n\nI am so sorry that you have to go through this, it's almost like they are comparing you to one another and that's not okay either. \n\nHappy birthday/belated birthday and I hope that you realize that's not a healthy environment.", "NTA. Your parents are being unfair to you, leaving you out of the birthday party and expecting you to be ok with that. At the very least, they could've gotten something for you. You still did good with giving your sister a gift even if you weren't getting one. Hopefully, your parents come to their senses.", "NTA... Get on social media, tag all your family and tell them the truth. That you didn't go to your sisters bday because your parents refused to let you have a party at all.", "ESH, but you the least.\n\nYour parents are obviously the biggest AH in this situation. What they're doing is really unacceptable.\n\nYour sister is an AH for letting them do this to you. If she sided with you and say she wouldn't accept to have a party if you're not getting one as well, your parents would have had no chance but to give in as she's apparently their golden child.\n\nYou only very slightly are the AH for deciding to use your sister's party for this protest which indeed negatively affected her.
