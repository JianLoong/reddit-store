I get it, mind you. I'm autistic, and a former educator, and the urge to respond to a kid like Kevin, who is a vicious, persistent, unrepentant bully and who unapologetically opens his mouth in your class and addresses a completely innocent kid who is already isolated and excluded from his classmates with humiliating slurs . . . it's REALLY hard not to cut him down to size. He certainly deserves it.\n\nBut you can't do that. Not just because it could get you fired, but because you need to model being a better human for kids like Kevin or they will NEVER learn. Because a kid who uses the r-word freely like that is almost certainly hearing it at home. You need to teach by example, and that includes not retaliating, and not humiliating your students, even the awful ones. Don't be that guy. Be the guy who they ALL learn from, how to be a decent person. \n\nESH. Kevin needs suspending for bullying, and a lesson or five in how to treat other human beings.

He very recently moved from a SpEd class to mainstreaming with one-on-one time with a helper, and likely wouldn't recognize any of this situation as being insulting enough to bother telling me about it. Are Tony's IRL initials the same as a popular video game system from the 90's?\n\nETA: That said, ESH. It was incredibly unprofessional to stoop to bullying a child (even if he's a bully), and I think it's *illegal* to disclose a student's grades to people that are not the student or their parents. Obviously Kevin sucks for being a bully, no matter who he is bullying. And Kevin's parents extra suck because they're the ones that should be stopping Kevin's behavior.", "YTA Your comment was unprofessional.

As you describe him as extremely smart but socially inept. It sounds more like he should be on an accelerated schedule that skips much of the standard lesson plans. To get him to college as soon as possible. \n\nMy school didn\u2019t quite have that. But after the elementary school i went to did IQ tests of the students. I spent one hour of my school day in an accelerated math course which introduced more complex math topics. Although I didn\u2019t know at the time why I had to leave my normal class to this special class each day with two other students.", "NTA \n\nKevin is acting like a little shit and needs to be put in his place. While what you said was really blunt, you never insulted him and in fact, called him out on his hypocrisy when he made those ableist comments.", "YTA\nKevin's comment was completely out of line, but so was your response. You are the adult and a teacher on top of that. It's one thing to think it (I've had similar thoughts as a teacher in the past), but you cannot say it.\n\nIf the bullying is that big of a problem, steps need to be taken, of course.

You exchanged insults with a literal child who is under your care. What is wrong with you? \n\nHonestly, you should be more concerned with your own immaturity and inappropriate behavior than with a child\u2019s bratty behavior. It is horrifying that you don\u2019t think you did anything wrong - you have deliberately turned the classroom into a hostile, embarrassing place for one of your students. You should not be entrusted with teaching or supervising children when you act like such a child yourself. \n\nI hope you get fired for this, and find a career far away from children.", "YTA, even though what you said was completely accurate and completely called for.

You\u2019re a bully", "YTA - 35 kids in a class is unacceptable, so I can understnad if you feel overwhelmed, but this is 100% the absolute WRONG response to this situation. You don't shut bullying down with more bullying.", "OMG YTA. Please reach out to a school coach or admin and ask for support in building a classroom community. You are the adult and you should NEVER speak like that to a kid. Ever. It\u2019s your job to educate that child (the one you call the bully), hold him accountable, and give appropriate consequences. Not speak to him like you\u2019re 12.", "YTA.  You disclosed the bullying student\u2019s private info (grades, class standing, whatever you\u2019d call it where you live) in retaliation for behavior you didn\u2019t like.

I do not in any way condone bullying.  I was bullied as a child & it is torturous.  But I don\u2019t agree with a teacher bullying a student either - which is exactly what OP did.  She deliberately remarked on his academic standing in front of a room full of his peers in an attempt to humiliate him.  As the supposed responsible adult in the room, she should have followed whatever disciplinary procedures exist for a handling bullying in her classroom.  (And I\u2019d bet my salary those procedures do not include disclosing private info regarding a student to others - especially a classroom full of the student\u2019s peers.  If those procedures are inadequate, that\u2019s something she should advocate for rather than turning into a bully herself in front of a classroom full of her students.)", "YTA. I am a teacher too. I understand what it is like to have that one annoying bully in a class that disrupts everything. I actually have a couple of them right now. I also understand that you want to protect the other students from them. However, your response was inappropriate. You stooped, and exhibited the very behave that you want to deter. I would have spoken to him with an administrator present. I would have said that this was one of many incidents that is going unchecked, and there is no support from the parents. This would have lead to the admin having to do something. Perhaps suspension or detention. I would also suggest that this particular student undergo restorative justice. Meaning that they have write a reflection on their behavior and why it is wrong and they give that to the student they insulted. This is one of the things that we've implemented at our school. They are suspended until they follow through with the restorative piece.", "There's a saying \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\" How Kevin behaves from now on should give you an idea of how effective your comment was. If he continues to bully others, then it didn't work. If, however, he's genuinely shaken at being taken down a peg or two - and he becomes more humble as a result - well, that will be evident from his behavior as well.", "YTA the kid was clearly out of line and should have consequences and intervention.

Don't do that to yourself.", "Yeah this sub kind of only has three versions of kids victims, brats, and sweet babies that are too young to know better.", "That's what I was thinking too.", "Yeah, this could absolutely be the case. I went to school with a guy who started bullying around 4th/5th grade. It turned out he had undiagnosed dyslexia and could no longer hide his reading issues.", "No need to explore why bullies are bullies. They do it because they like to hurt others. Anything else is just an excuse.", "Or because he can\u2019t pass his classes.", "He\u2019s still a kid though.\n\nYes, it\u2019s poor behaviour from him but the OP is a teacher, not another elementary school pupil.\n\nSo I have put OP is TA because of the power imbalance. If it was 2 kids, everyone would suck. But OP is bullying a kid and being bad at their job.", "Yes, they will absolutely get fired if Kevin's parents (rightfully) make a complaint.\n\nFERPA violations are not something you fuck around with.", "That's a wild leap.\n\nMy actual job for the best part of the last three decades has been interacting with,  and advocating for teachers.  As such,  I've been in more than a few classrooms,  for more than a few minutes. \n\nI stand by my judgment, and I'm fairly sure every educator I've met in the last 30 years would agree.  This was some unprofessional bullshit", "Yep, this! OP is an authority figure putting down a child. If OP had been a classmate I would classify it as justified AH move, but they are the adult.", "Kevin learned being an ah is appropriate. Because his teacher did it.", "You just justified bullying.... no the teacher is the one that needs to hold their tongue. Did the kid deserve it? Yes I agree. However it's not the op place to make those statements. Plus bullies tend to not have good lives at home.", "But like maybe you could stop them from bullying if you understand them..?", "that's typically what held back means, yes, usually", "So you\u2019ve never taught a classroom of kids for any length of time but think they don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d to be in the classroom.  You must be a great advocate for teachers.  One false move in your book and it\u2019s straight to unemployment.  No wonder people don\u2019t want to be teachers.  Even there advocates only plan is to pass the buck every time.  Everyone is critical after the fact.  That kid is sure going to learn something for getting a teacher fired in your school.  Another Donald.", "It's gonna go one of two ways in my opinion if OP keeps pulling stuff like this, the kids around kevin in this case are gonna learn its ok to bully because their teacher is doing it and then follow suit in bullying Kevin for failing 2 subjects he could potentially have real struggle with or the student's around Kevin are gonna think OPs just another asshole teacher as time goes. It's a lose lose situation with things like this", "Bullying is when you constantly attack someone not a onetime statement of truth.  Especially to teach a kid that they can\u2019t get away with making fun of other kids when he is the least smart one.  It is the teachers job to teach him.  But if his parents don\u2019t reinforce that lesson then the kid will keep doing it.  \nNow if everyday she was making announcements in front of the class about him then it would be bullying.", "Not always. Some parents voluntarily hold kids back a year. Especially in elementary school if they think they might not have developed enough yet.", "No it's still bullying. Judt because it's not repeated behavior and it's not putting in place as if it was another student. It came from a position of authority to humiliate them. Plus no lesson was learned and just perpuated the cycle. We don't know what's going on in the kids life the kid could have behavior problems maybe the parents aren't trying ,but you're conflating your personal emotions with bullies or being bullied  with what should have been the right thing to do. Did the kid deserve it? Yeah personally they did. Is it okay for a teacher to do that? Not at all. The school system failed for not actually addressing it. I get the op's position but it doesn't change that it's out of line.\nBullying is an action usually seen repeated but it can happen even if once. The only reason op stopped was because they got reprimanded for it. Plus from an authoritive figure it would qualify as bullying.", "*typically* and *usually*\n\nEspecially during covid, yeah a lot of kids did get held back even though they technically passed.", "So what would have been the proper way to deal with this kid?   And I will say I have a bit of experience with kids this age.  They want attention, sure maybe because they don\u2019t get it at home or maybe they get to much.  But calling them out for attempting to get attention the wrong way is ok. Irony is a good lesson to learn.  Having consequences for distracting the whole class is a good lesson.  Continuing to make it person is not good.  But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.  There is nobody in the world that can handle all these fake high standards that parents put on teachers in classrooms today.  None of them follow them but are quick to criticize after the fact and claiming there was a better way.  But they can never give a better way.", "Let's see in a school they should have been sent to admin(it's not the best but in school there is protocol  for it) in my expierences with kids putting them down never helped.  Rooting the cause and showing the effects of actions is the course ideally. But it's not a fake standard to follow protocol. Again my main two points are still poignant. You're conflating your personal feelings with bullying or being bullied as a catharsis because a system doesn't work. And b perpuated a cycle by bullying a child won't solve it but make it worse. Kids are cruel and try to bully him. Kid might get physical", "So you don\u2019t have a solution except pass off the problem and complain. Got it.", "Tell me you didn't read what i wrote without telling me you didn't read what I wrote. Just because you have unresolved issues with being bullied doesn't mean what op did was correct. You need to calm your revenge boner.", "So you want to send him to the admin to be explain what he did was wrong and it hurt the other kids feelings?  Sounded like she did that already.  And let him learn from experience.  It sounds like you read a book and became an expert in a day.  Practicality is different then academic."]}
