The occasional client would pay extra for us to get matching clothes, some crazy makeup, or order a specific setlist. Lana was such a client: we agreed on an amount for us to buy pale lilac clothes and accessories, and she gave us a list of artists she wanted to hear during the reception.   \n\n\n  \nWe signed the contract, I got myself a lilac dress, the guys got their lilac ties and shirts, and I sent a photo of the ensemble to Lana to make sure we fit the wedding theme. We didn't: she expected the guys to buy actual lilac suits. I told her there was no way the agreed money would cover that, especially since they would have to be tailored in that color, but she started to point to the contract, said it wasn't her problem that we didn't expect lilac suits, and after a long argument I agreed to buy the suits on our dime.   \n\n\n  \nThen a month before the wedding she called me and said we will have to arrive 3 hours before the agreed time. I said sure, did the timing change for the reception? Oh no, she just doesn't trust people to be on time. She won't be left left standing there waiting for 'her staff' to arrive while her guests laugh at her.   \n\n\n  \nI tried telling her that we'll be there on time, and when that didn't work, that she will have to pay us for those extra 3 hours. She pointed to the contract again, which allowed for time changes on the wedding day. I told her that clause is for vis major events, like a fucking hurricane, not for free labor. She threatened to sue us if we 'broke' the contract, so I thought fuck it, those 3 hours are not worth this much drama.   \n\n\n  \nThen I went and changed the setlist we were planning on performing. I found the most obscure songs from Adele and Celine Dion and whoever else Lana wanted to hear, and told the guys that this is what we're doing now. They found the idea hilarious and we started to practice.   \n\n\n  \nFast forward to the wedding day, Lana starts looking angry at around the fifth song. She comes up to the stage and asks us to play something they know. I told her that we prepared from the agreed artists. She then started to demand specific songs, to which I said I'm sorry, but we have to stick to the setlist, as per our contract. She looked at the list and blew a fuse when she realized she doesn't know any of the songs.   \n\n\n  \nShe didn't dare make a scene on the stage, but she was visibly fuming the whole night, and later we learned that she was so upset she canceled their honeymoon. The songs were still nice and perfectly suitable for a wedding, but I still felt horrible by the time we were done with our little revenge plot,\u00a0because we \\*did\\* just ruin her own wedding for her. The guys still insist Lana deserved it but we all know men have no soul, so I turn to you, collective reddit conscience: were we assholes for going through with it?

You knew more than a month out that she was trouble.", "Your job begins when the contract is clearly established with all items agreed. Specials get even more clarity. Sadly, this is the kind of person who creates red flags and then sets fire to them. The signature line needs extremely clear agreement wording. You wasted the 1/3 1/3 1/3 payment rule.\n\nYou went way way above and beyond the agreement. Try to be agreeable ends when your spider sense tingles. Hard way to learn, know most folks are decent.", "NTA - What you did with the setlist was a little petty and unprofessional, but by the sounds of it, the bride deserved a taste of her own medicine.\n\nThe positive thing about this is that it reveals the flaws/loopholes that were in the contract that you created. You can now rewrite it in a way to ensure that this never happens again.", "Nta I think she had that coming.", "NTA, she played a stupid stupid game and won the GREATEST of stupid prizes! :) There are two things you should NEVER do for a wedding, anger the caterer and anger the person in control of the music! You ruined nothing, she chose to ruin it herself by acting a fool.", "NTA. Hey, she exploited the contract; you paid her back.", "Bridezillas usually get their comeuppance in the end.

Probably a lot of other people didn't wear lilac suits either in spite of her demands..", "NTA, she was a rotten person and earned her revenge.", "I want to hear more about her canceling the honeymoon.

Maybe later though, cause that would probably cause an influx of viciously laughing people merrily throwing around N T As. xD", "We always arrive 2 hours early to set up and soundcheck (it's usually an overkill but we've been to places that seemed surprised that electricity is required to work a mic, so 2 hours are a safer bet). She wanted the extra 3 hours on top of that, because the venue was a bit out of the way (about an hour from the city). So we ended up leaving 6 hours before the start and played sudoku while we were waiting for the guests lol. \n\nThanks for your judgement.", "I would've loved to have attended this wedding. I'm a big fan of B-sides. \n\nI don't think I would've been friends with this bride though, so I would never have been invited.", "I did want to tell the story, yes. That's why I'm here. \n\nBut also, imagine expecting to dance and sing along to your favorite songs on what is supposedly the happiest day of your life, and get only music you've never heard before. This was supposed to be a moment of happiness for her, and if she canceled her honeymoon because of it, then I don't think it was simply about anger. What if she cried after we left? She likely still looks back on the day with resentment instead of joy. \n\nIt may sound like a satisfying revenge story but we *did* ruin that day for her.", "Understandable, but canceling a contract within 6 weeks of a wedding comes with a penalty (it's near impossible to find a new band in that timeframe). We already invested money in the clothes, we didn't want to come out of it with a net loss.", "NTA.\n\nI was surprised when you changed the setlist to include only obscure songs from the bride\u2019s favorite artists.

Making sure someone else couldn't pull the same antics would have only been prudent.\n\nBut I would not be at all disappointed if you said the wording that let you uhhmmm... liberally interpret the range of music available from the requested artists for inclusion in the set list... was still in place. You're artists. You deserve that measure of artistic license.", "I\u2019d put a special hidden Easter Egg page on my band website with the team dressed in the suits looking awesome, with \u201cwe\u2019re professional and stylish!\u201d And include a list of the songs with \u201cfamous artist tracks, including\u2026\u201d. \n\nNTA. Well done!", "NTA\n\nAs someone who gets anxious about time, I would be sympathetic if she had asked you guys to ensure an extra 30-60 minutes in case of traffic/whatever else. That's it. All of her other requests were over the top, and her threats to sue and attitude of \"not my problem\" were nasty.\n\nIt sucks for her that her wedding day was marred, but it was by her own behavior. And it would have been anyway if you guys had decided to break the contract with only a month to go and she had to scramble for a replacement.", "Yeah, that whole part of the contract needs to go tightened up. I get it, times change, however, she literally ADDED THREE HOURS.  You could have shaved those three hours off the end of the reception, if the contract was worded differently.\n\nChanges are completely different than adding time.", "I\u2019m sure this sub will love the petty revenge and you will be voted N T A. And I get that but to give you the battle you seem to crave, I\u2019ll say ESH. \n\nFirst and foremost, your contract sucked. You didn\u2019t have sufficient clarity on the outfits and if the timing clause was actually for force majeur then it should have been clear enough to protect you from her ridiculous demands. I don\u2019t know why it wasn\u2019t, but I hope you fixed your contract for future bookings. \n\nSecondly, she sucked big time for not being reasonable about those things. Totally out of line. \n\nThirdly, you guys sucked a little bit for maybe taking the revenge a bit too far given the fact that apparently your contract wasn\u2019t a good one.", "You were quite cooperative, considering", "Yeah, Lana made sure our contracts have been airtight since then.\ud83d\ude06 Not that we have to fall back on it much\u2013people are generally reasonable and just want to enjoy their day with their loved ones. The Lana's are actually pretty rare. \n\nWe do allow specific song requests still, but we don't guarantee that we can do all of them. We have only so many instruments, minimal techno doesn't translate well to a piano, and Cardi B still doesn't work with our style no matter how hard we try. xD", "Yeah, the contract has been tightened since then, not that we meet many Lana's to be fair so it's rare that we have to fall back onto it to clear up issues. \n\nAnd thank you for your judgement\u2013tbh I was expecting to get more E S Hs to show to the guys to teach us some compassion, but I'll take what I can get.\ud83d\ude05"]}
