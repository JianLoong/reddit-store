My roommate B (23f) has been nice for the most part, and I\u2019ve even come to enjoy her company. My only issue is that she is always taking jabs at America. To clarify, I don't think America is above criticism, and I have no problem shooting shit from time to time. When I first met her I would laugh along, and didn't feel any type of way about it. However, it\u2019s become too frequent, and as time has gone on, I\u2019ve started to notice an obnoxious air of superiority every time she does this, which really makes me feel like it\u2019s not all in good fun anymore. She\u2019ll even refuse to believe me if I correct her when she says something untrue (i.e., when she said, \u201cAmericans are all so stupid because all of your tests are multiple choice,\u201d and I told her that wasn't true, she insisted the schools I went to must be different from most schools in America). I\u2019ve tried to go along with it, as I don't want to be an overly sensitive person, but it\u2019s starting to get on my nerves. \n\n\nAll of my frustrations came to a head last night when she started talking about how disgusting it was that America is so fat (a topic I\u2019ve heard her talk about *many* times). I was in a bad mood, I still tried my best to ignore her, but she just kept going. I\u2019ve always had to bite my tongue when she talks about America\u2019s obesity epidemic because B is overweight herself.  I finally snapped and stopped biting my tongue and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is a little ironic?\u201d she gave me a confused look and asked why she would think that, to which I replied \u201cWell I\u2019m an American, and I\u2019m a lot thinner than you. This conversation would make more sense if you were the thin one.\u201d She absolutely exploded and told me I had no right to make comments about her body. After that she locked herself up in her room, and now she refuses to talk to me. I made some beef stew for dinner tonight as a peace offering, but she still won't acknowledge my presence. I do feel bad about hurting her feelings, but I also feel like she shouldn't dish it if she can't take it.", "created_utc": 1701549095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189cfcp/aita_for_fat_shaming_my_roommate_because_she/", "score": 8574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My roommate B (23f) has been nice for the most part, and I\u2019ve even come to enjoy her company. My only issue is that she is always taking jabs at America. To clarify, I don't think America is above criticism, and I have no problem shooting shit from time to time. When I first met her I would laugh along, and didn't feel any type of way about it. However, it\u2019s become too frequent, and as time has gone on, I\u2019ve started to notice an obnoxious air of superiority every time she does this, which really makes me feel like it\u2019s not all in good fun anymore. She\u2019ll even refuse to believe me if I correct her when she says something untrue (i.e., when she said, \u201cAmericans are all so stupid because all of your tests are multiple choice,\u201d and I told her that wasn't true, she insisted the schools I went to must be different from most schools in America). I\u2019ve tried to go along with it, as I don't want to be an overly sensitive person, but it\u2019s starting to get on my nerves. \n\n\nAll of my frustrations came to a head last night when she started talking about how disgusting it was that America is so fat (a topic I\u2019ve heard her talk about *many* times). I was in a bad mood, I still tried my best to ignore her, but she just kept going. I\u2019ve always had to bite my tongue when she talks about America\u2019s obesity epidemic because B is overweight herself.  I finally snapped and stopped biting my tongue and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is a little ironic?\u201d she gave me a confused look and asked why she would think that, to which I replied \u201cWell I\u2019m an American, and I\u2019m a lot thinner than you. This conversation would make more sense if you were the thin one.\u201d She absolutely exploded and told me I had no right to make comments about her body. After that she locked herself up in her room, and now she refuses to talk to me. I made some beef stew for dinner tonight as a peace offering, but she still won't acknowledge my presence. I do feel bad about hurting her feelings, but I also feel like she shouldn't dish it if she can't take it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think there are a lot of guys who take the frustration and pain they are receiving in life (shitty bosses, customers, family, etc) that they have to take and transfer it to their friends. They felt powerless but if they can hurt another that means they aren't powerless. If they can leave a mark, so to speak, that affirms that they do exist and aren't just irrelevant and invisible.
