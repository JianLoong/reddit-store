Obviously, I\u2019ve taken a ton of math/physics classes over the years to be able to conduct research properly.\n\nMy FIL [60M] recently retired from his job in sales. Since then he has taken up studying physics. This does not mean that he went back to college and took physics/math classes (he took a semester of calculus in college like 40 years ago for his business major). Instead, he gets high and watches YouTube videos. For a while it was fun when he asked me to explain what we know about dark matter to him and I\u2019d draw out galaxy rotation curves, but about two years ago he started claiming he\u2019s figured out how to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. This is a huge unsolved problem in physics and would surely be worthy of a Nobel prize. I tried to shut him down and encouraged him to study more math, but he was pretty adamant that he didn\u2019t need to know math and his \u201coutsider perspective\u201d was actually a huge advantage. I was annoyed. Eventually my MIL and husband told him to stop bothering me. \n\nI thought that was it, but my SIL [32F] recently brought home a new boyfriend [38M] over Thanksgiving. This boyfriend has no schooling past high school (no hate, just want to make it clear). He does not study math/physics on the side either. He loves getting high with my FIL and listening to his physics theories, fancies himself a bit of a physicist himself, and they bounce ideas off each other. I always make myself scarce when I notice this happening. Eventually, SIL\u2019s boyfriend noticed and called me out one night as I was leaving. I tried to brush it off as \u201coh I\u2019ve turned my brain off for the night haha\u201d but then SIL\u2019s boyfriend said that with my PhD, I could really help them by fine-tuning their theories and get them published. I said no. FIL said he\u2019s really figured it out, he thinks he can get a book deal, and I should really listen to his theories. I said no, and reminded him that he should study more math. Sister\u2019s boyfriend then called me a snob who went to a fancy school and accused me of jealousy. So I finally said that I might be a snob, but they\u2019re just two armchair physicists who probably know as much calculus as my cat. Then I told FIL I\u2019d listen to his theory if he could tell me what a metric is (big concept in differential geometry, the branch of math you need to known to understand general relativity). Then I told SIL\u2019s boyfriend I\u2019d give him an even easier question and asked him what an integral was. Dead silence from both, so I left. We flew out the next day.\n\nHonestly I thought this was all behind us but husband and I are flying out to MIL and FIL\u2019s tomorrow, SIL and her boyfriend are coming too, but yesterday SIL called me and said her boyfriend is waiting for an apology from me, and so is FIL. I told her to put her boyfriend on the phone. Then I asked him if he knew what an integral was yet. He still didn\u2019t so I laughed and hung up.

I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t mean any harm, but they\u2019re acting entitled to your labor, and also it\u2019s frankly insulting that they think they can know more (or even an equal amount) about physics than you off of just YouTube videos. It all feels like it has undertones of misogyny if you ask me. If you were a cis man with a PhD in physics would they be doing all of this and demanding things of you?

Your FIL and SIL BF are not self-aware enough to tell when someone wholly disagrees with them and finds them irritating. Planetary physics are a mindfuck that I do not understand and would need multiple lifetimes of education to get to the PhD level. Them telling you they figured out the theory and you just have to do the proofs and publishing is like them telling you they designed a car and the only thing they need you to do is build it, get it running, test it, sell it, and mass produce it.\n\nThat said, they're dipping their toes in your topic of study and it is frustrating. I had an electrician at a plant that I worked at the constantly had ideas for a perpetual motion machine to run a generator for infinite electricity. Scares the bejesus out of me to think he was our only state-licensed master electrician. The more you explain the math side of things, the more they don't understand because letters and numbers dancing is an abomination to them.

Not putting yourself out there at all, of course.\n\nKeep exiting the conversation. Leave the room, take a walk. Play with a kid or pet, wash dishes, anything but engage.

On the one hand, it's is important that modern-day scientists have public support.  How else does CERN get built?  But on the other hand, highly technical fields are maybe not that well-served by public awareness.  No one thinks it's a good idea to encourage the amateur thoracic surgery club.\n\nQuantum physics Profs often have disclaimers on their websites asking people who don't at least know LaTeX to please refrain from sending them \"breakthroughs\" in theoretical physics!  Just yesterday I had to field the latest of several earnest requests from a retired physical therapist who keeps asking me to read his \"research,\" which I would characterize as a series of rambling and vaguely racist Word documents - all because I told him I did a tiny bit of quantum computation research in undergrad!\n\nI think that maybe it's worth considering your audience here.  It sounds like despite their professed interest in science, there is minimal chance that your FIL or BIL have any interest in taking differential equations at the local community college.  It also sounds like a reasonable observer should have known this already.  Their interest begins and ends at fun youtube videos, and you kinda knew that when you decided to scold them for not knowing what a linear transformation is.\n\nSo, knowing that their interest in science didn't extend past drug-induced \"deep thoughts,\" maybe you were too harsh with them.  They are here for middle-school level science demos, not grown-up literature review, and they are maybe even trying to connect with you about a thing they know you like.  Treat them like you'd treat a curious third grader who declares that he has a plan for a perpetual motion machine, not unruly undergrads biting off more than they can chew in office hours.", "NTA", "Info: what strand are they using?

He still didn\u2019t so I laughed and hung up.\n\nThat whole family, but especially the FIL and SIL's BF are exactly the type of people to buy into shit like perpetual motion devices and are short hop skip and jump away from flat earthers.  TBH in your position I would avoid talking about anything even remotely scientific around them like the plague, but if you're going to engage, give them the respect to act like you're teaching stuff to a child", "ESH.

At least I didn\u2019t have to contend with masking, social distancing and overall defense of herd immunity.", "This is fucking fantastic!", "Short answer: an equation with a derivative in it. \n\nLong answer: differential equations normally arise as models of other phenomena when you notice something changing. Or relationships between things that change. A famous example is Maxwell's equations--Faraday does all these experiments with magnets and coils of wire where he notices that moving the magnet through the coil (change in position) causes a current in the wire (change in electricity), and Maxwell takes all these observations and turns them into a set of equations relating how changes in magnetic fields induce changes in electric phenomena and vice versa (this is the dumb version of this story). Or the vibrating string problem (wave equation): someone noticed that when you create a \"wave\" in a string, the acceleration (change in velocity/second derivative of position along the string) in one direction was proportional to the curvature (change in slope/second derivative of distance from equilibrium). \n\nThe difficult thing with differential equations is that you're looking for the functions that make them work--and there's no single method. Each type of equation has its own recipe (or sometimes none, at which point we have to look for less direct methods of solving them).", "Kindly, this is the kind of opinion that happens when a person doesn't actually understand what math is.

That rate of change is the gradient of the line *at that point* which is useful in a line that's not consistent (wibbly! \ud83d\ude42)\n\nThat makes sense if you think about the notation dy/dx, because it's really a simplified way of writing \u0394y/\u0394x (\u0394 commonly used to denote \"change\")\n\n\n*NB I'm a chemist not a mathematician", "This is very true. Except, learning music theory can take decades. Of research, listening to music, finding different music, reading various theories on music. Understanding the instruments,  playing styles, different conductors, how sound affects listeners and even the environment. All of that takes time and study, and knowledge from those who came before you.\n\nSome of which you can access through the internet.  You can watch and listen to symphonies led by the greatest conductors of the last 75 years(maybe more, I have never looked), you can go see videos of people in random city listening to a live band as it is happening. \n\nYou can read books by or about composers from all over the world. From all different times and cultures.\n\nYou can learn about all different instrumen, s why they are made a certain w, y and how it affects playability and sound.\n\nYou can get countless amounts of sheet music. \n\nYour point about how to read research sounds great, but here is a story. I was taking a research writing class, and the professor was explaining as a formula how to quote a research paper in your own research.\n\nIt never made sense.\n\nSo I read through a bunch of research papers, reviewed how they used quotes in sentences, and practiced doing that. The rest of my time writing pape, s I used what I figured out, not what I was taught.\n\nThis wasn't to say what they taught was wrong. It was to say no one in the class understood it, and most didn't try to figure it out. \n\nThe fact is that the majority of online college courses I have taken in humanities, there was little to no feedback on anything taught. You read the readings, you did your assignment,  and if your professor vaguely cared, you got a grade in a week or two.\n\nI had a class where I had to go complain because I had an incomplete. The professor went on vacation before submitting grades and since there was a grand total of no grades or feedback given during semester I didn't even know if my assignments were ever received let alone if I actually was doing the work correctly. \n\nI was writing research papers before anyone taught me to. I just would look up what a paper looked like and try to create it myself.\n\nOh, when the professor got back, I had an A. \n\nYou can learn a lot with written guidance, which can be found online. And, as I have put in other responses, part of what I am saying is that you have access to resources you didn't have in the past.\n\nI may have to pay for a resource. In fact, much of what makes this type of study actually viable is that you don't need to have access to a university library to get that exact paper you wanted to read. Some you can get for free,  some you have to pay for, but you can access them yourself. \n\nI wrote a paper on an author from 150 years ago, and my professor was actually surprised at some of the resources I found through the internet. \n\nSo yes, there are benefits to going to college and having a professor in front of you. But if I get an A in a class with nothing but doing reading and writing assignments, then other than a degree at the end, what am I gaining that I can't get on my own. \n\nAs I have also stated elsewhere, I am talking about getting an undergraduate level of knowledge in a subject. \n\nOh, even now if I want to read a research paper and I don't understand something I do searches online for information about what I don't understand.  Sometimes I may have to go through various research and concepts before I start reading the paper itself. Can be time consuming,  but ultimately worth it, since I make sure I understand what I am looking at.", "INFO- Has he told you the theory?

Absolutely NTA!\n\nI have a PhD in geology. I'd like to say you wouldn't believe how many people have tried to mansplain my field to me but you know exactly what I'm talking about! Your FIL and SIL's bf really take the cake on this one, yikes.\n\nThey don't respect you or your expertise. They don't like being showed up and told how little they actually know so now you're the bad guy. The fact that the rest of your family sees nothing wrong with those two \"knowing more\" than you, the actual PhD, is really gross too. Youtube videos do not a physicist make, the same as it is for any other STEM field. You can sure learn a lot from reputable sources, sometimes including youtube videos done by experts, but you have to be so full of shit to believe you know more than the actual experts just because you've watched some videos. \n\nI have many anecdotes but here are my two favorite ones:\n\n- My dad legit convinced other people he knows more about my research than me, the actual PhD who DID the research. Why? Because he had proofread a handful of my grant proposals for grammar and that apparently gave him some deeper understanding of my work despite him not having any of the basic knowledge to fully understand it, including higher math. And then he further convinced people while I was still in grad school (and languishing with my dissertation) that HE could write it FOR ME, but it would just enable my \"laziness\" because he couldn't understand \"why is it taking you so long to write a paper\" when no dude, I was writing a fucking BOOK. Those don't just pop themselves out in a weekend. It took me four years to write that fucker. But he seriously thought he understood things better than me because he had read a few grant proposals and looked some things up on google. To this day he still refuses to acknowledge to me that I have a PhD (not even so much as \"congratulations\") but has no issue whatsoever bragging to other people about it and how he was \"so helpful\" and \"instrumental\" in my success. Because he read a few proposals and did some googling. Please note, you can't really google what I did in my dissertation because I was the first person in my field to do it, so...\n\n- The second example is from an ex bf. He fancied himself an intellectual. To be fair he is very intelligent but also very insecure and he really didn't like that his gf was getting a PhD when he barely had a GED (don't ask how we met or why I stayed, it's a dumpster fire story). As part of grad school I taught undergrad classes, mostly intro classes that cover a bit of everything. Part of the material I covered was climate change. In addition to that, part of my dissertation addresses climate change caused by meteorite impacts, so I do know what I'm talking about. I don't remember exactly what we were talking about but he made an off hand comment about how \"siberia will be a nice place to live\" when shit really hits the fan because \"it will be cold there\". I explained that no, high latitudes warm disproportionately compared to lower latitudes so siberia won't actually be cold. He insisted he was right and would not back down, even after I was like \"you know I used to teach this to students right?\" and \"you know I do active research on climate right?\". That's when I first recognized how insecure he was. He then tried to lecture me on various political things to prove I was wrong, as though that has anything to do with high latitude warming. He just didn't like being told he was wrong by someone with actual expertise in that area, just like your FIL and the bf don't like being told they are wrong by someone with actual expertise in that field. \n\nThis whole situation reeks of misogyny OP and I'm sorry you have to deal with it. It's frustrating to have your expertise questioned, especially by people who went to the School of Youtube and don't have the foundation to actually fully understand the concepts they are \"studying\", much less do something like come up with a grand unification theory. Small people don't like being reminded how little they actually know, especially by someone who knows what they are talking about. All they are interested in is looking cool and feeling good from getting attention and from other people (like SIL) thinking they are smart. It's about image, not any actual science.\n\nI'm sure you know this, but don't apologize. You've done nothing wrong except remind people who are absolutely full of themselves that they don't actually know as much as they think they do. Imo it's a mark of being an intellectual that you can freely admit how much you don't know rather than double down and insist you are all-knowing when someone challenges your ideas. That's where you break out the white board and markers to prove what you're saying, except they don't have the math background to prove anything. Maybe next time remind them that if they want to publish anything they will have to prove it, and in this case it will require proving very specific math to a hell of a lot of experts. Otherwise their \"grand theory\" is as good as toilet paper. \n\nKeep on being a rockstar my fellow scientist!

Clearly we have each taken at least two semesters of calculus. Clearly we did not go to the same school(s). I am of the opinion that I got a pretty decent handle on integrals in Calc 1 (which, for me, did include definite integrals, your own experience notwithstanding), and you are of the opinion that the meaning of integrals became clear to you in Calc 2.\n\nWhy did you feel a need to correct me, as if your experience invalidates mine?", "Kindly... I was a computer science major and a mathematics minor in undergrad; although that doesn't make me a mathematician, it does put me fairly squarely in the STEM category insofar as my education is concerned.\n\nYou can disagree with me on my assessment of STEM vs. humanities, but you will not talk down to me as if I'm a Trump-loving mouth breather whom be to dum too understood mat.\n\nKindly.", "First off, yeah OP isn\u2019t obliged to do anything of this sort with her ILs or really anyone, but this is AITA and regardless of whether or not one is obligated to do something doesn\u2019t change the fact that what they\u2019re doing can still be an AH move. \n\nSecond, nowhere does OP say that this has anything to do with not wanting to talk about physics outside of what could be an introduction. So again have to go back to, is this only about the fact that someone outside of the field has a theory or is there other behavior going on by the FIL? As of right now we can only really go with the former.\n\nThird, again seeing as OP said they enjoyed the talks until FILs theory, considering how OP and apparently you think about the FIL and his knowledge, it shouldn\u2019t really take all that much deep thought or time if they\u2019re the \u201cidiots\u201d you say they are to respond to their theory with \u201cyeah that\u2019s not really feasible because of X thing, I don\u2019t really want to explain it in depth but you can look it up\u201d\n\nLastly, just because someone isn\u2019t an expert in an extremely broad and highly complex field does not make them an idiot. Again, not going to say this guy has the answers or he\u2019s some genius but god damn if you have a friend who\u2019s an expert in something that you wanted to talk to them about and learn about from, and say you had a theory about it, how would you feel if they said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to bother listening because I know you\u2019re wrong\u201d you\u2019d feel kinda shitty wouldn\u2019t you? Not to mention while people outside of the field certainly aren\u2019t more knowledgeable about the field, to assume that people like that haven\u2019t contributed anything to the field is nothing short of idiotic. These aren\u2019t some strangers either, they\u2019re family, how can you for the potential sole reason of them having a theory on a field they aren\u2019t in, not even give them the time of day?", "Like I said, anti-derivatives/indefinite integrals are probably introduced in intro calc.", "And I find this a weird thing to get offended over. It\u2019s just the natural progression of calculus.", "Thank you!", "that's fair, I really only read your first sentence, it was mostly indefinite integrals."]}
