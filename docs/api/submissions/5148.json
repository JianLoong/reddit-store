Obviously, I\u2019ve taken a ton of math/physics classes over the years to be able to conduct research properly.\n\nMy FIL [60M] recently retired from his job in sales. Since then he has taken up studying physics. This does not mean that he went back to college and took physics/math classes (he took a semester of calculus in college like 40 years ago for his business major). Instead, he gets high and watches YouTube videos. For a while it was fun when he asked me to explain what we know about dark matter to him and I\u2019d draw out galaxy rotation curves, but about two years ago he started claiming he\u2019s figured out how to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. This is a huge unsolved problem in physics and would surely be worthy of a Nobel prize. I tried to shut him down and encouraged him to study more math, but he was pretty adamant that he didn\u2019t need to know math and his \u201coutsider perspective\u201d was actually a huge advantage. I was annoyed. Eventually my MIL and husband told him to stop bothering me. \n\nI thought that was it, but my SIL [32F] recently brought home a new boyfriend [38M] over Thanksgiving. This boyfriend has no schooling past high school (no hate, just want to make it clear). He does not study math/physics on the side either. He loves getting high with my FIL and listening to his physics theories, fancies himself a bit of a physicist himself, and they bounce ideas off each other. I always make myself scarce when I notice this happening. Eventually, SIL\u2019s boyfriend noticed and called me out one night as I was leaving. I tried to brush it off as \u201coh I\u2019ve turned my brain off for the night haha\u201d but then SIL\u2019s boyfriend said that with my PhD, I could really help them by fine-tuning their theories and get them published. I said no. FIL said he\u2019s really figured it out, he thinks he can get a book deal, and I should really listen to his theories. I said no, and reminded him that he should study more math. Sister\u2019s boyfriend then called me a snob who went to a fancy school and accused me of jealousy. So I finally said that I might be a snob, but they\u2019re just two armchair physicists who probably know as much calculus as my cat. Then I told FIL I\u2019d listen to his theory if he could tell me what a metric is (big concept in differential geometry, the branch of math you need to known to understand general relativity). Then I told SIL\u2019s boyfriend I\u2019d give him an even easier question and asked him what an integral was. Dead silence from both, so I left. We flew out the next day.\n\nHonestly I thought this was all behind us but husband and I are flying out to MIL and FIL\u2019s tomorrow, SIL and her boyfriend are coming too, but yesterday SIL called me and said her boyfriend is waiting for an apology from me, and so is FIL. I told her to put her boyfriend on the phone. Then I asked him if he knew what an integral was yet. He still didn\u2019t so I laughed and hung up.

Be sure to tell them that the field is highly competitive and not to mention your name because jealousy and fear would make them automatically reject their theory.  Tell them to write it all out so they have a theory in writing to submit and then they couldn't have their ideas stolen.  That takes you right out of the equation except as a spectator.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t mean any harm, but they\u2019re acting entitled to your labor, and also it\u2019s frankly insulting that they think they can know more (or even an equal amount) about physics than you off of just YouTube videos. It all feels like it has undertones of misogyny if you ask me. If you were a cis man with a PhD in physics would they be doing all of this and demanding things of you?

Definitely NTA though, and if you\u2019re not feeling like doing damage control then more power to ya!", "NTA\n\nI originally was going to say ESH but I can relate with the stigma around STEM (I'm an enjuneer). Your FIL and SIL BF are not self-aware enough to tell when someone wholly disagrees with them and finds them irritating. Planetary physics are a mindfuck that I do not understand and would need multiple lifetimes of education to get to the PhD level. Them telling you they figured out the theory and you just have to do the proofs and publishing is like them telling you they designed a car and the only thing they need you to do is build it, get it running, test it, sell it, and mass produce it.\n\nThat said, they're dipping their toes in your topic of study and it is frustrating. I had an electrician at a plant that I worked at the constantly had ideas for a perpetual motion machine to run a generator for infinite electricity. Scares the bejesus out of me to think he was our only state-licensed master electrician. The more you explain the math side of things, the more they don't understand because letters and numbers dancing is an abomination to them. You won't make a breakthrough, it's pointless, you're powerless, save yourself.\n\nI don't believe you owe them an apology.

The barstool experts get going....and so does my frustration. \n\nFor your own sanity, don't engage anymore at all. You're doing the right thing.\nIt'll take some time for them to realize you're the 'dumb' one, and  leave you alone.\n\nMaybe one idea for you would be to let them know that you're area of study is more narrow and confined, and their level of thinking operates at a higher level than what you do.\n\nAlso give them some general Google-able contacts to some pubs to satisfy that demand. Not putting yourself out there at all, of course.\n\nKeep exiting the conversation. Leave the room, take a walk. Play with a kid or pet, wash dishes, anything but engage. They'll realize their superiority over time and leave you alone.", "NTA. These two jokers don't know what they are talking about. You are under no obligation to take their stoner theories seriously when they have never studied physics or know anything about it.", "NTA, sounds like you were more than patient and only gave them any flak when they wouldn't drop it or listen to reason.

They could be having fun learning about physics from someone who knew (I used to live with a physics guy and led to some funny convos) but instead they chose whatever this is lol", "NTA\n\nThey singled you out when you tried to make yourself scarce, then they prodded you for information about a subject they don\u2019t have the qualifications to make huge advancements in.

My FIL (an accountant) used to explain my field of study to me on a regular basis.

Write down Einstein\u2019s equation for GR then tell them to re-derive Schwarzschild\u2019s solution for the radius of a black hole before you\u2019ll take them seriously. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be that difficult, Schwarzschild did it in 1916 while he was serving on the front lines in the German Army during WWI.", "NTA. I like your style.", "NTA\n\nTis the season for some nonsense!  Falalalalalalala!  But you bring up a trickier question.\n\nThere is a large community of science fans out there who don't know any math. People who like to smoke pot and watch Adam Savage blow things up, and think real scientists are All-American superheroes!\n\nIs it good that they think black holes are fuckin' awesome, etc. or is it just a way to waste real researchers' time?  On the one hand, it's is important that modern-day scientists have public support.  How else does CERN get built?  But on the other hand, highly technical fields are maybe not that well-served by public awareness.  No one thinks it's a good idea to encourage the amateur thoracic surgery club.\n\nQuantum physics Profs often have disclaimers on their websites asking people who don't at least know LaTeX to please refrain from sending them \"breakthroughs\" in theoretical physics!  Just yesterday I had to field the latest of several earnest requests from a retired physical therapist who keeps asking me to read his \"research,\" which I would characterize as a series of rambling and vaguely racist Word documents - all because I told him I did a tiny bit of quantum computation research in undergrad!\n\nI think that maybe it's worth considering your audience here.  It sounds like despite their professed interest in science, there is minimal chance that your FIL or BIL have any interest in taking differential equations at the local community college.  It also sounds like a reasonable observer should have known this already.  Their interest begins and ends at fun youtube videos, and you kinda knew that when you decided to scold them for not knowing what a linear transformation is.\n\nSo, knowing that their interest in science didn't extend past drug-induced \"deep thoughts,\" maybe you were too harsh with them.  They are here for middle-school level science demos, not grown-up literature review, and they are maybe even trying to connect with you about a thing they know you like.  Treat them like you'd treat a curious third grader who declares that he has a plan for a perpetual motion machine, not unruly undergrads biting off more than they can chew in office hours.", "NTA", "Info: what strand are they using? Could be fun", "I honestly don\u2019t know. Maybe an ESH, then way more that you.  \n\nFeel like you could have entertained their hair brained antics a little, but they way you got on the phone at the end and asked if he knew what an integral was yet made me laugh out loud.", "ESH...\n\nIt would be NTA, except for this line:\n\n>I told her to put her boyfriend on the phone. Then I asked him if he knew what an integral was yet. He still didn\u2019t so I laughed and hung up.\n\nThat whole family, but especially the FIL and SIL's BF are exactly the type of people to buy into shit like perpetual motion devices and are short hop skip and jump away from flat earthers.  TBH in your position I would avoid talking about anything even remotely scientific around them like the plague, but if you're going to engage, give them the respect to act like you're teaching stuff to a child", "ESH.
