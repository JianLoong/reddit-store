I would have full blow lied and said the better job was in the works first. But that is my fam jam, and everybody is unique. In my fam it\u2019s all truth or all lies: I tend to go with the truthX as I have accepting unconditional vibes in my life, but know that is not the norm. I changed my judgment with additional information already for the record.", "\u2026this cements the idea he isn\u2019t a keeper. At some point you go from being the subject of the lies to the one receiving them. Do you really want that?", "That is super relevant to my perspective actually, and does give you the moral high ground. It\u2019s bad form all around for this guy. If he needs to lie to his mom that says something about him as well. I change my judgment based on this. I\u2019ll go edit. If lying to his mom is halfway commonplace then it made lots of sense here, given your level of secrecy that sounds like a problem. He has some grovelling to do at the very least.", "this isn't \"hiding stuff from family\"", "Thank you, I appreciate that. It\u2019s one of those things where I genuinely don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong and I believe that I am in a lot of cases, but to me I wouldn\u2019t have done this to a friend let alone a partner. \n\nThere are things I could\u2019ve done differently along the way with this whole thing but I can\u2019t change that, I\u2019m trying to make the best of a difficult situation. This felt like a step backwards from someone I really care about and I\u2019d only just found my footing! \n\nWishing you all the best and thank you for seeing things from multiple perspectives", "The investigation is definitely what was embarrassing. I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to colleagues or clients I\u2019d worked with for 5 years suddenly out of the blue. Innocent until proven guilty doesn\u2019t work in this case and I wasn\u2019t allowed to communicate to anyone about it, so I knew they\u2019d know something had happened and given I couldn\u2019t clarify what, I was concerned they\u2019d let their imaginations run away and think I\u2019d done something illegal, immoral or awful.\n\nIt\u2019s also embarrassing for me personally. I pride myself on being good at my job, and committed and dependable, so the suggestion of not being so was very damaging to me. Also there\u2019s the embarrassment of facing unemployment this close to Christmas - who would willingly do that to themselves in this economy? I was so anxious until I got my new job and I thought everyone would think I was reckless for leaving.", "NTA...we should all have a reasonable expectation of privacy with partners. How can you now feel comfortable telling him anything and expecting it to remain between the 2 of you? How can you be sure he hasn't already shared your experience with your other friends (especially now that he is upset with you)?", "Yea this is a weird one.  BF should not have spilled that tea.  I personally would not have found that work issue to be embarrassing but that doesn\u2019t mean ignore your wishes.  I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a malicious if he\u2019s just being ignorant.  I can certainly see how it\u2019d be a red flag to how he valued your wishes.\n\nDoes he use his mother/brother to confide in other issues in his life?  I talk to my brother about everything.", "They are close but they don\u2019t talk about everything. He actually very rarely talks about me to anyone which is why this is so out of character. I was in hospital recently and the extent of him communicating about me to others was \u2018she\u2019s fine\u2019 when people asked how I was doing. It\u2019s not like him to have done this", "Signal fire warning others to stay away.", "Did he shop this information about your work to mutual friends or anyone else?", "NTA - and RUN. If you can\u2019t have personal stuff between you and your boyfriend you\u2019re gonna have a lot of problems in the future. This is such a small thing you asked him not to discuss. I can\u2019t imagine what bigger life things y\u2019all would go through that he\u2019d also feel okay to discuss just because \u201cit impacted him too\u201d what a lame excuse.", "NTA.

Asap.\n\nNTA by the way.", "NTA, but re-evaluate this relationship because obviously NOTHING you ask BF to keep between the two of you is guaranteed to stay that way", "NTA - You need to seriously reconsider this relationship.  Your boyfriend does not respect the bonds of your relationship and feels he should be able to steamroll your wishes about information that only concerns you.  \n\nHe had no reason to break your trust other than he wanted to.  And he's doubling down on it, which means he sees nothing wrong with what he did.  He feels entitled to blab any info about you because 'yOu CaN't cOnTrOl mE!'  C'mon with that nonsense.\n\nThis is what your future with him looks like.  Is that something you really want?  Someone who doesn't respect you and will lash out on you when he's the one at fault?\n\nThis man is showing you who he really is.  It's up to you to decide if he's the one you want to be your partner.  He certainly doesn't respect you or have your back, that's for sure.", "NTA, but your boyfriend is strongly TA. He has no respect for your wishes and is trying to twist it back at you to make it seem like he's the one who should be upset. Don't fall for this kind of treatment. Anyone who cannot respect your wishes in a situation like this doesn't truly care about you. He's showing you what he's made of, and it's not much.", "NTA, it\u2019s not his information to tell, and no, he\u2019s not allowed to decide how he speaks about it. He sounds like the kind of person who would tell his family your sensitive medical information without asking first as well.", "NTA\n\nYou changed jobs, that's it. The reasons why are none of your partner or his family's business.", "NTA - you told him something in confidence and he did not respect you enough to keep that confidence.  His family didn't need to know this.  I'd say this is a huge red flag.", "NTA...unless you stay with a person who is willing to trash you to his family.  \n\nDo you see the Red Flags?\n\nQuit the toxic relationship like you did the toxic job.", "NTA\nYour boyfriend has no right to tell your stories for you, and if you specifically ask him not to tell these stories or parts of them, he should respect that. It wasn't his story to tell. You may need to examine other ways your boyfriend undermines or embarrasses you because if this is regular behavior or if it could become regular behavior, it's abuse.", "It wasn't HIS story to tell, but now you know who is more important to him.", "NTA. You should resign this relationship like you did your job. You\u2019ll find a better boyfriend who will respect your wishes like you found a job with tons of benefits. Anyone who would just disrespect you like that then blame you for trying to control them, is way out of line.", "NTA I kept so many things from my family about my marriage. Even after the divorce I didn\u2019t tell them everything that went wrong because I didn\u2019t want it getting back to my daughter someday. Plus it was embarrassing or stupid. I can\u2019t imagine why he felt he had to tell his family", "Nta. You set boundaries he ignored. Major red flag. I have been married 26 years and recently realized that my husband does not respect my boundaries and has never done so. We are starting counseling soon and may be headed for a divorce. Not telling you to leave him, but I wish some one would have explained boundaries to me when I was much younger.", "NTA\n\nYou put down a boundary, you didn't even tell him he couldn't mentioned you're changing jobs, just to not tell the whole mess that happened, just the truth that you quit would suffice.  If this isn't the only boundary he's ignoring, maybe start weighing the pros and cons of the relationship and if the negative is outweighing the positive, act accordingly.", "NTA - I'd dump him over this. How disrespectful and cruel to be gossiping about your personal business", "NTA. You set a boundary and he crossed it, breaking your trust in the process. However. Your BF may not understand how important this was to you. He may have even thought you were being overly sensitive about it and reached out to his family to get perspective. My spouse and his family talk about everything, which, as a pretty private person, boggles my brain.", "NTA and it doesn't matter how long you've known his family, he's TA either way. I got into a car accident, wasn't even my fault but I didn't want my husband to tell my in-laws bc they have traditional views of women and driving, they only mention it in passing but it's enough to stress me out. He never mentioned it to them, he never will, because I asked him not to and he cares about my feelings.", "NTA\n\nHe disrespected your boundary.  That's a no-go.", "For me this is a clear NAH.\n\n(1) you have the right to ask your partner to keep a confidence for you, however,\n\n(2) you can\u2019t control your partner and he has the right to share important information with his family.\n\nOutcome, you and your BF have different priorities and values and probably aren\u2019t compatible. Breaking up might be the best solution to incompatibility but it doesn\u2019t mean either of you are an A H.", "NTA - but now you have to decide if this is a relationship you want.  It is up to you now that you know that he will tell his family everything even if you ask him not to. Are you able to live with that?  I know some people are very private and this would be a deal breaker other people not so much.  But this is what dating is all about so now you have to decide stay or go?", "NTA.", "NTA. He not only crossed a clear boundary, but got mad and defensive about it.", "NTA- \"ex-\"boyfriend is. This is a red flag \ud83d\udea9 of things to come.

The fact that he disregarded it and then flipped out on you when you pointed it out in order to make you feel bad and question yourself over his blatant disregard for you is HUGE red flag. His behavior is not normal or acceptable for good people.", "Absolutely NTA. You asked him to keep personal information in confidence and he betrayed your trust, as simple as that. The fact that they're his family has nothing to do with it and neither does the length of time its been since it all happened. He still made the decision to share your personal information. You were absolutely right to tell him that he violated a boundary, this is behavior that will definitely show itself again in the future.", "Thank goodness you aren't married, still time to get away from this horrible man with minimal difficulty. He has no respect for your wishes, your feelings, your boundaries- no respect for YOU.  NTA and please know that he is not good enough for you.", "NTA\n\nThese people who damage the ones they supposedly love the most and then blame the people they wronged are just the worst.\n\nYou should stick to your guns on this otherwise you\u2019ll never have inter-marriage intimacy with out feel afraid he\u2019s going to blab to his family.", "Expect every hardship to be explained to his family whether you want it or not.   In fact he may be doing this maliciously in order to break you down so he can control you.", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to make an excuse that this \u201cimpacted\u201d him too but honestly, this is just gossipy. You took care of business. There was NO need to tell his family.

That would make me really careful what I tell him in the future.", "NTA I hope your are working working on your self and kick that AH out of your life if he can talk about this what else is he saying and telling RED FLAGS RUN", "NTA. It's not any of his family's business and he's basically saying that he should be able to share it all he wants without you being allowed to get upset simply because he knows about it. He's told you straight up with his argument that he can't be trusted with anything that you wouldn't want to become public knowledge. You have every right to be upset that he shared personal info about you that you had specifically asked him not to share.\n\nAlso, his actions and the way he reacted when you confronted him sound very much like common behavior among abusers, especially paired with how you feel like you're going insane (a commonality with gaslighting victims).  It honestly sounds like he might have done it just to ruin your reputation with his family (alienate you from them) and/or to test the limits of how much he can disrespect you and get away with it (another abusive behavior). Obviously, I can't say that this is absolutely the case, but I've heard countless stories where abusers act exactly like this and progress their behavior after the relationship has been settled (around a year in). He's likely been building up to this level of disrespect over time if this is what's happening, though, so it might be good to look more closely at any other times he's purposefully disrespected you.", "NTA\n\nHe is a narcissist leave now, I grew up with a narcissist, they will make your life miserable, and he shows the classic signs of it. WALK AWAY .......", "NTA, but your partner is.", "NTA... and you're also not toxic. Whatever happened it happened to YOU at YOUR job. This didn't affect him really and you didn't ask him not to speak about it, you only ask him not to go into details. He went out of his way not only to talk about your situation at your job with his family and do exactly what you asked him not to (which wasn't much really). This is an absolute act of disrespect. Not his story, not his rights. He's trying to make this situation about himself and gaslight you in teh process. \n\nYou have to carefully consider that people DON'T change, this is who he is whether you are his girlfriend or his wife and the situations like this will only escalate the longer you are with him.", "NTA\n\n...

Your partner deliberately breached your trust in him. How can you trust him with anything now?\n\n> it was his experience too and he\u2019s allowed to decide how he speaks about it.\n\nGross and creepy.

He is a momma's boy, and an unsupportive partner. I don't care about the details of your previous employment. You shared with your partner, and you wanted him to support you. He stabbed you in the back. He mocked your sensitivity. He belittled your feelings. You deserve better. Go get it, because he's not it.", "Part of being in a relationship, even friendship, is making sure you are selective in what you share and who you share it with. You now know he can't be trusted with your personal information and will use it for attention and entertainment value.\nNTA", "By that logic you could tell him you can discuss his private matters with your family, since it affects your life (even if it doesn't), it is your experience too and you decide how you speak about things because you won't be controlled - just like him.\n\nIn fact, I'd go so far as to do it on the phone in front of him.   Hopefully he will eventually get the point and realize his logic (and excuses) is flawed.   \n\nHe is not showing that your feelings matter - only his perspective, which frankly is a selfish viewpoint.

You didn't take the road to fight these accusations. That doesn't mean they were right. Even if you *had* done what they accused you of, you deserve a clean break, and you are more than worthy. \n\nI thoroughly recommend that you seek some therapy to work past this, and walk with your head held high. \n\nYou can't control how other people (ex company, or even bfs family) perceive the situation, but you CAN control how you move past it, and how much power you allow it to have over your present and future.", "NTA leave him.. if he cant keep his mouth shut about that, there is no hope for the future. hes gonna tell them all of YOUR business... also who quits before using the evidence they have to Clear them? that literally makes no sense, but hey maybe youre embarrassed cause that was a dumb decision? idk either way, hes the AH for telling your business.", "NTA and dump him", "NTA.
