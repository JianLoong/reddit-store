Hi, Aunt Jean!", "My mother would not stop there lol, many might, but if I tried to leave that information dangling lol, I would hear about it for months. I would have full blow lied and said the better job was in the works first. But that is my fam jam, and everybody is unique. In my fam it\u2019s all truth or all lies: I tend to go with the truthX as I have accepting unconditional vibes in my life, but know that is not the norm. I changed my judgment with additional information already for the record.", "\u2026this cements the idea he isn\u2019t a keeper. At some point you go from being the subject of the lies to the one receiving them. Do you really want that?", "That is super relevant to my perspective actually, and does give you the moral high ground. It\u2019s bad form all around for this guy. If he needs to lie to his mom that says something about him as well. I change my judgment based on this. I\u2019ll go edit. If lying to his mom is halfway commonplace then it made lots of sense here, given your level of secrecy that sounds like a problem. He has some grovelling to do at the very least.", "this isn't \"hiding stuff from family\"", "Thank you, I appreciate that. It\u2019s one of those things where I genuinely don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong and I believe that I am in a lot of cases, but to me I wouldn\u2019t have done this to a friend let alone a partner. \n\nThere are things I could\u2019ve done differently along the way with this whole thing but I can\u2019t change that, I\u2019m trying to make the best of a difficult situation. This felt like a step backwards from someone I really care about and I\u2019d only just found my footing! \n\nWishing you all the best and thank you for seeing things from multiple perspectives", "The investigation is definitely what was embarrassing. I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to colleagues or clients I\u2019d worked with for 5 years suddenly out of the blue. Innocent until proven guilty doesn\u2019t work in this case and I wasn\u2019t allowed to communicate to anyone about it, so I knew they\u2019d know something had happened and given I couldn\u2019t clarify what, I was concerned they\u2019d let their imaginations run away and think I\u2019d done something illegal, immoral or awful.\n\nIt\u2019s also embarrassing for me personally. I pride myself on being good at my job, and committed and dependable, so the suggestion of not being so was very damaging to me. Also there\u2019s the embarrassment of facing unemployment this close to Christmas - who would willingly do that to themselves in this economy? I was so anxious until I got my new job and I thought everyone would think I was reckless for leaving.", "NTA...we should all have a reasonable expectation of privacy with partners. How can you now feel comfortable telling him anything and expecting it to remain between the 2 of you? How can you be sure he hasn't already shared your experience with your other friends (especially now that he is upset with you)?", "Yea this is a weird one.  BF should not have spilled that tea.  I personally would not have found that work issue to be embarrassing but that doesn\u2019t mean ignore your wishes.  I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a malicious if he\u2019s just being ignorant.  I can certainly see how it\u2019d be a red flag to how he valued your wishes.\n\nDoes he use his mother/brother to confide in other issues in his life?  I talk to my brother about everything.", "They are close but they don\u2019t talk about everything. He actually very rarely talks about me to anyone which is why this is so out of character. I was in hospital recently and the extent of him communicating about me to others was \u2018she\u2019s fine\u2019 when people asked how I was doing. It\u2019s not like him to have done this", "Signal fire warning others to stay away.", "Did he shop this information about your work to mutual friends or anyone else?"]}
