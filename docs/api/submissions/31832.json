At home though, in her pyjamas? YTA - but maybe by accident. Where is the risk that you are trying to protect her from? Is it you or other family members? It\u2019s weird to justify policing this in your home, her safe place to be as relaxed as possible. As an adult, I absolutely take my bra off in my home and wear singlets and comfy clothes. I am home. Others might have t-shirts and undies or otherwise semi-naked. Because they are home. You would have a bigger impact explaining modesty and how what we were out of the house may have tighter boundaries than in, or that different places have different expectations (beach vs church vs fancy dinner). But let her be relaxed in herself in her home.", ">Am i being too strict in wanting her to consider more modest choices even when we are at home?\n\n>i also find myself struggling with this choice especially when it comes to her dressing inside our home.\n\nINFO Why does her choice of clothing bother you so much in the privacy of your home?", "Info: Why do you want her to dress differently at home?

Have you ever considered how embarrassing and hurtful it is to basically be told you're dressing like a slut *in your own home.*\n\nNo? Probably not because you're a man. As women we deal with this all the time. She's at home, safe, and you're policing her clothes. I don't want to take on an accusatory tone here but I always find it extremely weird when men have an issue with their young DAUGHTERS not wearing a bra at home, or being too \"revealing.\" Ask yourself why you feel this way and self reflect.\n\nEdit: Nevermind, after reading your comments I am taking on an accusatory tone. Stop sexualizing your teenage daughter and maybe consider not staring at her breasts. I've always been able to wear whatever I want at home because my father doesn't see his child sexually, like normal people should do. Gross.\n\nEdit 2: OP is in the comments saying he's right because he's her dad, dropping \"100\" emojis to people who agree with him, and admittedly staring at his daughters boobs.

Why?", "When I was her age I started doing something similar but more with the trends of the day. My mum very honestly told me I was welcome to wear what I liked but that some people would hold issue and feel the need to comment/be creepy. She made sure I had the confidence to tell those people to 'Eff off' and left it at that. \n\nI think allow her to her thing, make sure shes warm enough in her clothing choices but otherwise I think you'll just need to sit this one out.", "YTA! From reading comments , your main worry is that the somewhat revealing clothes she wears AT HOME, she will want to wear in public , why would she wear her pyjamas in public ?? You\u2019re sexualising your own daughter and saying that she is showing too much \u201cskin\u201d . Stop looking at your daughter in that way.", "In your home- YTA.  Who is she being protected from?

But especially as pyjamas she should wear whatever is comfortable for her.", "YTA - She should be able to wear whatever she wants in the comfort of her own home. The way you're describing her clothing choices sounds like you mainly have a problem with her PAJAMAS being revealing. Why would you care??? The only people seeing her in her pajamas is family, no? Stop sexualising your child. And if you have guests over early in the morning/late at night when she is in her pajamas, get her a dressing gown or a robe for modesty.\n\nAs for OUTSIDE of the home, what she wears is still her choice. You can sit down with her and explain your concerns to her directly about how (I assume this is your worry?) people might view her differently if she wears revealing clothing. However, her clothing is STILL her decision, and ultimately you should be teaching her that it doesn't matter what other people think, especially total strangers ogling a 14 year old's body, and that she has the freedom to wear whatever clothes she is comfortable in. Anybody made to feel uncomfortable by a 14 year old's body has their own issues to work out. Unless she's going out wearing literal lingerie, leave her alone.", "My guy. No. YTA\n\nI used to be a teenage daughter of someone. That someone doesn't really express himself, but he's more on traditional side like he doesn't wear t-shirts or boxers or Bright colours.\n\nMy conservative dad let me wore shirts with open back, spaghetti strap tops without bra or booty shorts. I didn't hear a peep from him All these years. He asked me during winter why I was only in my undershirt once - and I explained to him I felt really overstimulated those days and would dress myself soon. He only criticized me if something wasn't fitting me right.\n\nDon't do this to your daughter. She might be overstimulated and these clothes might feel like She Can breath again. Don't jepardise her comfyness. She cannot do that anywhere else. Leave it be. Or communicate to her that you don't like it but you'll respect her Choice of clothing as long as She won't wear them outside.", "YTA.

People seem to be missing the point that he is policing what she wears AT HOME. Outside, yeah I would encourage her to dress a bit better because we live in a shitty world. This comes off as controlling and sexualizing his own daughter.

She should be able to be naked at home and your only concern about that should be hygienic reasons, ex if she scratches her behind while cooking. \n\nAnd I saw in a comment that you believe your daughter knows that she is safe at home to express herself, well if she had that feeling before you are certainly changing that now. And your creating for her the image to let men decide how and what she should wear. Most women do not were a bra at home. A tip for you is to start following some females online, read some books and feminist sites and info etc, to understand what it is to be a teenage girl. She should not be sexualized at home by you. By telling her she reveals to much skin you are in fact sexualizing her by definition.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to decide what she feels comfortable in.\n\nYou're her father, she should feel safe expressing herself around you, but you've decided to objectify her body and makes men's urges , her problem.

Why do you have a problem with seeing her skin?\nI've seen my parents and siblings naked all the time and it's the most natural thing.\nYou imply to her that you see her in a sexual manner by telling her to wear modest clothing around you.", "YTA\nIt sounds like you are afraid of your daughters growing body. She's nearing adulthood and she's not a little girl anymore (yes a girl and not an adult yet but not a baby and entering womanhood). This sounds more like you aren't comfortable with her body. That's a you problem and maybe you need to talk to somebody about it. You say \"I want her to feel confident and empowered but I also worry about how others might perceive her.\" What you actually mean is you either want her to be confident and empowered OR you want her to worry how others perceive her because there is no way to find a balance there. You are the issue here. You need to focus on undoing your beliefs regarding how women/girls dress and get over the fact your daughter ia growing into a woman. Her breasts and her legs are only an issue because you are making them an issue. I don't want to say you are sexualizing your daughter because that's a bit far for this post but you are getting very close to it. You need to educate yourself about perceptions regarding the way women/girls dress and you need to educate yourself on how to instil confidence and empower your daughter.

Did you think people would *agree* with you?", "as a teenage girl myself I just do not understand why ANYONE thinks they have the right to police my body. my mom has the same views as you do and while i understand wanting to protect your child against creeps, telling me what to wear just feels like YOU are sexualising me, not those creeps. it feels like you\u2019re seen as an object by those you love most, and it really really hurts.\n\nif others think about me in a creepy way because of the way i dress that is THEIR fault and not mine. if i feel confident and comfortable in shorter shorts or without a bra, that\u2019s my choice to make!! \n\nconclusion is that i really think your feelings are valid, but your actions need to change. parenting is hard: ofcourse you want to protect your daughter, but in my experience policing what your kid wears does way more harm than good.", "You think loose pajamas aren't modest?

So I suspect a lot of your discomfort comes from the fact that you haven't faced and talked about where your discomfort comes from with your daughter.\n\nIf you sit down and have a talk with her and explain that part of the reason you're so concerned with her clothing is that it serves to remind you that you are, gradually losing your baby girl and that it makes you very sad but that you want to support her and love her and want her to be happy, she might be a bit more understanding and inclined to support your feelings too.", "NTA - as a single mom, who has both teenage daughter and son, I teach my daughter to dress in a way which is appropriate.\n\nI do come from SE Europe where we just learn to dress for occasions and be respectful and place more importance on that than this craze to wear anything. \n\nDon\u2019t let this modern nonsense get to you.

For god\u2019s sake, she should be allowed to walk around in underwear or naked for that matter. It is her private space.

Entitled boys her age, who believe they are allowed to touch her without consent are entitled, abusive and wrong all on their own, it has nothing to do with her tops or whatever she is wearing. The thing about dressing appropriately is about context. You don\u2019t dress the same way to go to class as you do to go to a party. You don\u2019t dress like you are going to the beach when you go to work. Even in events that sound similar, there might be differences, like you can\u2019t use some dresses you would for your own prom or graduation party to someone else\u2019s wedding (depending on color or appeal).
