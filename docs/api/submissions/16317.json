We were separated into groups and dispersed around the school building. In my group it was me, my friend Ashley and two others Megan and Jeff. Megan and Jeff left to go get some things from the bands room so Ashley and I were left alone. Ashley who had been looking kind of pale all day mentioned she was dizzy and nauseous. I placed her arm over my shoulder and helped her to the restroom. It was after school and no was else was there and no other groups were close to this restroom so I thought it was fine for me to go into the girls room. \n\nI brought Ashely in and she threw up. After she was done I started helping her out. As we were leaving the restroom Megan appeared. She saw me come out the girls room and walked over to me. She started berating me and calling me a pervert completely ignoring the almost passed out girl I\u2019m holding up. I bring Ashley to sit down and explain what happened. Megan said that\u2019s no excuse and I should have waited for her to get back. She then storms off to get the band director. Soon Jeff appeared and said he just passed and angry looking Megan in the hall and asked what happened. When I explained the situation he said he would have done the same. \n\nWhen the director gets here he asked what\u2019s going on, all the while Megan is standing behind him looking all smug. When I explained it to him he told me it was alright and good on me for helping. Megan didn\u2019t like that I faced no consequences. So when going to the band director didn\u2019t work she tried to spread rumors of me peaking on girls in the restroom. Luckily for me Jeff, Ashley and the director were able to backup my side of the story and everything was fine. There were only a couple of girls who agreed with Megan and said what I did was inappropriate. Megan is still pissed and says she now feels uncomfortable around me. \n\nAlthough no one else is mad Megan\u2019s strong reaction makes me think there is something I\u2019m missing, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1683137887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136v2yn/aita_for_going_into_the_girls_restroom/", "score": 544, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately rumours can stick and hurt people for a long time to come, and people, especially teenagers, don\u2019t always think about the consequences of what they say or do. If needed, talk to your band director and say that whilst you feel comfortable with what you did at the time, Megan is making comments about you that make you uncomfortable, and you want to ensure that you are not put into a position where you are left alone with her or her friends.

Just because something is the way it is, doesn't mean we should accept that. Sex segregated bathrooms are being used a cudgel to other trans people now and it is important to understand that it a relatively recent phenomenon born out of bigotry around the turn of the 20th century, not some immutable constant throughout history. Understanding how and why things exist allows us to make informed decisions that are better for society. \n\n> shouldnt all that matter be how people feel now?\n\nNo. Creating good policy relies on much more than just modern feelings. Science, economics, theories of justice and many other non-feelings based concepts are of huge importance to creating good systems. If we just did what people felt no improvements would ever be made. \n\n> I would feel a bit uncomfortable if I went into a certain place expecting only a certain group of people but instead some of the people that were meant to be excluded were there.\n\nOooeeee....
