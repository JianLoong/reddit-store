We were separated into groups and dispersed around the school building. In my group it was me, my friend Ashley and two others Megan and Jeff. Megan and Jeff left to go get some things from the bands room so Ashley and I were left alone. Ashley who had been looking kind of pale all day mentioned she was dizzy and nauseous. I placed her arm over my shoulder and helped her to the restroom. It was after school and no was else was there and no other groups were close to this restroom so I thought it was fine for me to go into the girls room. \n\nI brought Ashely in and she threw up. After she was done I started helping her out. As we were leaving the restroom Megan appeared. She saw me come out the girls room and walked over to me. She started berating me and calling me a pervert completely ignoring the almost passed out girl I\u2019m holding up. I bring Ashley to sit down and explain what happened. Megan said that\u2019s no excuse and I should have waited for her to get back. She then storms off to get the band director. Soon Jeff appeared and said he just passed and angry looking Megan in the hall and asked what happened. When I explained the situation he said he would have done the same. \n\nWhen the director gets here he asked what\u2019s going on, all the while Megan is standing behind him looking all smug. When I explained it to him he told me it was alright and good on me for helping. Megan didn\u2019t like that I faced no consequences. So when going to the band director didn\u2019t work she tried to spread rumors of me peaking on girls in the restroom. Luckily for me Jeff, Ashley and the director were able to backup my side of the story and everything was fine. There were only a couple of girls who agreed with Megan and said what I did was inappropriate. Megan is still pissed and says she now feels uncomfortable around me. \n\nAlthough no one else is mad Megan\u2019s strong reaction makes me think there is something I\u2019m missing, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1683137887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136v2yn/aita_for_going_into_the_girls_restroom/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you did was not wrong. Keep being kind and supportive of those in need.  \n\n\nMegan seems overly sensitive about the issue. Between this, the fact that she says she feels uncomfortable around you, and her spreading rumors about you being pervy, I would make sure the two of you are never alone together.", "NTA.  Megan is super immature.  Adults understand why rules exist and have the sense to understand when it's OK to break them.", "NTA, Megan is acting very immature and her behavior is inappropriate. You helped someone who was clearly ill and needed help, Megan needs to mind her own fuckin business.", "NTA. Hey look, a director who gets it. Care comes first. Ensuring your friend is okay comes first.", "NTA. I'm not sure why Megan is so opposed to you helping someone who was ill. The only inappropriate person here is Megan and those that agree with her.", "Absolutely NTA! You were helping your friend who was having a medical issue! That\u2019s completely justified and you\u2019re a good friend for helping her out, regardless if you were in the girls bathroom or not. Megan honestly sounds like a fool here\u2026\n\nShe tried to purposely twist your story to fit her personal narrative, and when that didn\u2019t work. She went to desperate lengths to spread insane rumors about you being some kind of peeping tom pervert. She is 100% looking for drama and to ruin your life over not getting her way.\n\nI would definitely recommend staying clear the hell away from her. Because while it seems like she\u2019s \u201cavoiding you.\u201d She\u2019s probably still thinking of ways to get you in trouble and make you seem like the bad guy. Block her socials and just distance yourself immediately. This is what I don\u2019t miss about high school.

The reality in the world is that women sometimes go into men's restrooms and men sometimes go into women's restrooms -- it happens all the time, and when people are respectful about it, there is no issue.\n\nThen there are minor emergencies like the one you had.  Megan can go pound sand, you apologize to nobody here.  Good job doing the right thing.", "NTA - Megan needs to mind her own business. She could have actually made a positive difference by going getting the band director because your friend was ill.", "NTA, you were being a good friend. Plus Ashley clearly felt comfortable having you in there with her, and she was the one actually involved in the situation. So her opinion is all that matters", "NTA. What does she mean you should have waited? That's not how vomiting works.\n\nAnyway, there are lots of reasons people go into \"wrong gender\" bathrooms. As long as they aren't doing sexual harassment or assault, I don't care. And I would never just presume that's what someone is doing.", "NTA. Some people are just really hung up on weird religious gender roles. They would rather conform to a role than help someone out.", "NTA. You did just fine kiddo.

Sex segregated bathrooms in general are based on antiquated \"separate spheres\" ideology that says the \"weaker sex\" must be segregated from others for their protection in a similar way to how you had separate bathrooms for blacks.

Anyone that would go to the lengths that she did is no friend. Also how dare she assume your gender!?/s", "NTA. You brought her to relieve what she was feeling. It wasn't malicious. This Megan character seems to have wanted to splash some creepiness onto you without giving a crap about a fellow student being sick. Kudos to you. Megan, on the other hand, needs to start growing up because bathrooms are used by everyone, not just one particular group.\n\nOr, she was jealous. Just a thought.", "NTA\n\nMegan's behavior is something you and many people you know will encounter throughout life. That is to say people with rigid beliefs in right/wrong who are strongly averse to others who violate said belief. In this case the belief is \"The Women's bathroom should only ever have women in it.\" This is psychologically similar to road rage where people get angry at others for not doing what they feel is correct.", " NTA. She\u2019s uncomfortable around you because her plan to roast you did not work and now she looks stupid.", "Wow. Of course you\u2019re NTA. Megan is very young for her age, isn\u2019t she? She sounds like an eight year old.", "NTA. The girl you helped was feeling dizzy...the possibility of fainting and hitting her head on a stone/tile floor (which frankly people can die from) is worse than someone of a different gender making sure she is doing o.k. in the bathroom.", "No of course you were not wrong. NTA", "NTA and good on you for helping out a friend in need. \n\nHowever, I would be careful around Megan, and any of her friends who are backing her up. Unfortunately rumours can stick and hurt people for a long time to come, and people, especially teenagers, don\u2019t always think about the consequences of what they say or do. If needed, talk to your band director and say that whilst you feel comfortable with what you did at the time, Megan is making comments about you that make you uncomfortable, and you want to ensure that you are not put into a position where you are left alone with her or her friends. So anytime you\u2019re out into small groups, if you\u2019re put into a group with any of them, make sure you have a buddy and say \u201chey, no matter what happens, we need to stick together ok\u201d. Because sadly, she sounds like the type of person who would throw false accusations against you if she got half a chance, just for the attention", "Tell Megan you feel uncomfortable around her. Say it loud and often.", "NTA\n\nAshley should NOT have been left alone. If she passed out alone while vomiting, she could have aspirated it. You 100% did the right thing staying with her, because that's First Aid.", "NTA but do not be alone with Meghan any of her friends or unfortunately any girl you don't know at this point. Remain in view of other people or have your phone set to record if you have to.", "NTA - you helped someone in need.  I think you deserve a standing ovation!", "NTA", "NTA.  If Ashley had fallen in the bathroom, she could have broken her nose, teeth or gotten a disabling or even fatal brain injury.  This girl Megan just needs to shut her yap.", "NTA. But you need to be extra vigilant with Megan. She looks like the type that doesn\u2019t give up the fight. She will get you one day so be careful.", "NTA.  Megan is being extremely childish.  Be prepared for her to potentially lie or at least tell the story in the worst possible light for you.\n\nBut the only important things is helping a friend in need.", "Megan sounds republican. Hey you cant help that person in a way i dont want! /s", "NTA you were helping a sick friend", "NTA\n\nI honestly think you should report her behaviour to the principal if you can because she's actively trying to sabotage your reputation by slandering you. This is bullying, and it's dangerous.", "NTA you did what essentially any good person would have. Considering all the variables in play there\u2019s no way you\u2019re in the wrong unless Ashley specifically requested you didn\u2019t come in with her and or you didn\u2019t check to see if anyone was occupying the restroom before going in. I don\u2019t quite understand why some girls behave like that but they do. (had girls tear into for some small thing and make me out to be the devil it\u2019s been so long I don\u2019t even remember what they were upset about.)", "NTA- worst case you say you identify as a women and all is forgiven", "Megan is a huge AH. You did very well. Honestly I would go out of my way just to get back at her", "NTA, you were helping your friend, you shouldn\u2019t be dissuaded from doing so again in the future either. She clearly just wanted to get her way even realising she was mistaken, an ego too big to admit it was just a misunderstanding.", "NTA at all. Megan is. She needs to chill out. I bet if it was her that was sick and you DIDNT do something about it \u2026 she\u2019d be pissed too. (Even if she is ever sick in the same way NEVER go into a bathroom for her. She will turn it around so fast and get you into trouble \u2026 sounds like the type of person she is.)", "Definitely NTA. Megan\u2019s got some issues that go beyond what she is mad at you for. Good for you for being a good friend and helping someone out. If Megan can\u2019t see you were helping a friend out, that\u2019s on her, not you.", "Yeah, I wouldn't either. Anyone who spreads false sexual allegations to try to punish somebody is a dangerous person."]}
