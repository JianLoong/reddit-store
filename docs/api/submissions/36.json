My SIL snaps and says \u201c if you don\u2019t want to give the money to us just say that, don\u2019t lie and then continue to spend more on your useless cats, it\u2019s cruel\u201d and with that I was really shocked to respond because she seemed very irritated and did not want to continue the conversation.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m not a high earner ,this is my first full time job that I\u2019ve been in for 3 ish years .

Also, a trip to _Thailand?_ A bit extravagant. Go hit up a HoJo and let the kids swim in the pool for a couple of days. The kids won't appreciate that big trip yet anyway.

THEY chose to have children, you chose to be a foster mom to cats. You have every right to not want to give them money for a vacation. OP due to this abhorrent behavior from your family you should consider setting HARD boundaries on this. If they can\u2019t respect you, then they don\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA.\n\nIMO, they need a firm and direct reply: I have helped you meet your kids\u2019 needs many times. I have lent you money that you have not repaid. You can ask if I will pay for your vacation, but you should not act as though the money I work for is yours to claim when you want.\n\nI definitely understand dynamics among family can be difficult. We should all feel some obligation to help ensure those in our family are doing okay, and it sounds like you do that. You help meet needs and have let \u201cloans\u201d to them go without pressing the issue of repayment.\n\nIf they were asking for money for some genuine need (our kid is sick and needs treatment or they need help buying books for school) I would feel differently about it\u2014not that you could be said to truly obligated to cover their expense, but like they would be more justified in their frustration. But, they are asking you to fund their vacation. Vacations are nice, but they aren\u2019t something anyone should go demand anyone else pay for.\n\nYou work hard for your money. You can do whatever you want with your extra income. If taking good care of foster cats is what brings you satisfaction, then do that with your money. Even if you weren\u2019t spending money taking care of animals, you wouldn\u2019t be obligated to pay for their vacation.", "NTA - Definitely not. Funding their vacation and other whims is unacceptable. No need to justify your income and spending decisions. Her snide and direct comments about your life is disrespectful and wrong.  You are not on this earth to fund them; that is their responsibility. \n\nI noticed you never throw lending them money w/out being paid in their face. Sometimes this keeps people in check as to how outrageous their requests are. You understand where their entitlement perspective comes from but you DO NOT need to pander. Love on your nieces and nephews; sounds like this brings you joy. Best to you.", "NTA It is YOUR money you have absolutely no reason to feel bad for denying abusive entitled gaslighting dead ends in evolution like them!! They are nothing more than thieves trying to take what they have not earned through manipulation and lies thats the literal definition of a con artist ... As much as it sucks for the kids go no contact with them they can con others into sitting for them cause if you don't its only going to wear you down even more... You HAVE to grow a backbone stop being a meek pushover its just making you an even bigger target there is a difference between being non confrontational and being a doormat and right now you got boot prints all over you from them using those kids against you ... Cut them off", "NTA \n\nYour brother and SIL are so entitled and I can't believe they have the gall to call you and ask for that much money for a trip (that you wouldn't even be going on mind you). \n\nYou need to stop being a doormat and tell them flat out you won't be giving them any money. What you do with your hard earned money is non of their business and maybe they should stop having kids they can't afford. \n\nAlso, it takes a special kind of person to foster animals, mainly the kind hearted and empathetic kind. What you're doing isn't worthless, you're saving the lives of these animals.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are repsonsible for their kids. You're responsible for your cats.

Stop giving money to family period.", "1000% NTA. Your brother and SIL sound insane. They really asked you to fund their vacation? \"For the kids\"? Please, they don't have the money to vacation at all, let alone a crazy Thailand trip the kids may or may not remember. Those wonderful kittens have nothing to do with their poor financial decisions, and if they feel so entitled, they should go back to asking your parents. I'm sorry you have to deal with them though, I would feel tremendously embarrassed for asking family to fund me and my kids, for a vacation of all things. I am surprised that they would be this entitled to your money that you work hard for. And thank you so much, as a former foster, that you're taking care of such sweet babies.", "NTA.  You owe them nothing, not even the babysitting you are doing for free.  Use some of your money to get a therapist's help in to learn how to deal with your toxic, obnoxious family.

Stanger Things is such a great show.", "NTA. They're not asking you for money for the kids sake, they are asking for themselves. Kids at that age don't care about \"exotic\" destinations, adults often do.\nYou have no obligation to give your brother and sister-in-law a penny. From the way this sounds, you should start setting firm boundaries in regards to finances IMMEDIATELY or behaviour like this will only escalate.", "NTA\n\nNext time they bring it up, ask when they are going to give you the kids to foster. Since they obvs can't afford to care for them, and need you to do everything. And just keep saying that every time they ask for money or treat you as the free childcare. And be sure to comfort them that there's no shame in being bad with money.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to give money to them. Don\u2019t let them pressure or guilt you into it. Those cats need a home more than those kids need a vacation.", "NTA. The more you engage with them the more they\u2019ll push so try not to engage with them at all - give a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help\u201d and end the conversation.

It doesn't really matter how they feel.about the cat rescue,  as you aren't asking them to bankroll it. \n\nTaking care of family is a two way street, so if they're disrespectful and don't help you, they're absurd to think they can ask this of you.", "NTA.\n\nBut SIL and brother are.", "NTA - First of all, you owe nothing to your brother, the kids or this self entitled SIL you have.  You are not obligated to give them money bc it could be used \"on more important things\". That's not their business what you do with your money. Your responsibility is your cats, not them.  If they wanna hang their lips from their financial crisis, that's not your issue... don't let them back you in a corner to make u feel guilty. What are they doing out of the country anyway if they so damn broke? And you are expected to help with their expenses? Lol bruhhh, I would laugh in their faces and go off on both of them. They got nerve that's for sure.", "NTA.  You have passions that you are pursuing, and rightly so.  It's no one else's business what you do with your money.\n\nSay it with me: It's my money.  It's not my brother's money.  It's not my SIL's money.  It's my money.  I can spend it any way I please.\n\nI would strongly urge you to stop being your brother's--and by extension, SIL's--doormat.

The entitlement of your family is appalling!   You are ABSOLUTELY in the right to care for your foster cats (hats off to you by the way).  Your brother and SIL are ASSHOLES to the highest degree.  Just remember, \"No\" is a complete sentence.  They do NOT deserve your reasoning.  Just \"NO\".", "NTA\n\nYour brother, his wife, and THEIR (keyword here) 3children are NOT your responsibility. Raising kids is expensive (I have 3 myself) but NEVER should someone assume that it should be someone else's responsibility to pay for items that are not needed. It would be one thing if Brother and SIL were working full time and were having trouble covering basic needs, food, shelter, clothing, et. But it still would not be your responsibility.\n\nI would suggest you put your foot down and tell brother and SIL if they cannot respect your boundaries and stop asking for money, you will go no contact with them. Let your parents know that it is not your responsibility to take care of anyone but yourself and whatever you see fit to spend your money on. And if they continue badgering you about giving money to your sibiling b/c \"raising kids is expensive\" then you will go no contact with them as well.\n\nYOUR BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY ARE NOT YOUR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL don't get to decide how you spend your money. I would be very unavailable for babysitting in the future. Who do they think they are? The audacity of some people!", "NTA. TELL THEM NO.\n\nYour niblings aren't your responsibility. It is not down to you to provide for/give them anything. Not a single thing, especially not a holiday to Thailand!! The actual audacity! To me that's not so much a holiday for the kids, but for them! Stop lending them money. If your parents call cut the convo and hang up. \n\nThey chose to have 3 kids. Not you, and that means not going on holidays or whatever.", "NTA\nWTF what is wrong with your in-laws? Better use your money for sweet cats than these brats. I will never understand persons that are begging for money to have a more luxurious life.\nMy family was poor, we never did any vacations. Once our neighbours offered to take us with them. But my parents were reluctant because they weren't able to pay any compensation and did not want to be a burden for others. Maybe I was sad as a kid but as an adult I understand now their decision. As kids we did not really miss vacations, but it was nice to have others persons around to spent some time with us. Just playing lego or read a story to kids and they will be happy.", "You're being an asshole to yourself if you dont stand up. Why are you even in contact with them? All they do is shit on you.", "NTA so she chose to have that many kids - she didnt stick with one, she had more and now she thinks you need to fund their luxuries, not even necessities but luxuries like a long haul holiday. LOLOLOL if the kids need a holiday she can find somewhere local - holidays are anything where you don't sleep in your own bed. They are not exotic and long hall.\n\nAlso you can do anything with  your money. Stop handing money for emergencies - they can go to your parents or learn to save. Tell her it all stops because of her rudeness and entitlement.", "NTA\nCut your brother off or block them all at the very least like Jesus.\nDo not ever lend them money again as they seem to think your their wallet like wtf that's not how family are supposed to treat eachother ya know.\n\nAnd you do a very noble thing! I'm glad you help cattos in need even if they don't think so I do! You should be very proud and I'd love to see catto picks if you'd wanna DM!

Do not waffle regardless of what the money is for, for the next year, you need to say no all the time. And don't bother fighting about it either, simply say \"no, that isn't in my budget\" to all request for money. Sure, you can go in jointly on gifts, treat the kids when you have them, but any request at all for money should end with \"no, sorry.\" And then if your sister pushes, just ignore her, change the subject, or leave the conversation. \n\nDo not let her make you feel bad. You don't make enough money to support her family, you have no obligation to do so, and how you spend money on things that make you happy is no one's business. We all deserve hobbies and to spend on ourselves- or our pets - and you need to shut out her negativity completely.

And cats and other animals give pleasure and company 24/7. And in your case, you are literally saving lives. \n\nSo don't let them shame or guilt you about it. I am sure that no every penny they earn goes on the children - that they never eat out, go to a concert, on holiday. And if they are allowed that,then so are you.

My brother is stubborn if he sets his mind in something he won\u2019t let go until it has literally crumbled to nothing , so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be taking up a second job and sister in law might work full time once my nephew is a bit more older. \n\nThank you so much, the cats are my respite , they are never a chore or liability to me , and for as long as I can I want to help them without my family adding In their unwanted opinions", "And isn't OP their own family? Why isn't OP allowed to spend their money on themselves rather than giving any \"leftover\" to brother and SIL? And shouldn't \"take care of family\" also mean not have a family you can't afford? \n\nThis is especially manipulative as we know the brother and SIL would not give OP any money should they need it.", "I appreciate that just very scared about losing my family, it\u2019s something I need to learn to overcome , my fear and their guilt is making me cave in to their demands , I need to slowly learn how to stop it granted it might take some time, thank you so much, by right that is what I should do but just the anxiety around it , but after this incident I know it\u2019s going to ever get better until I make a stand.", "No, friend. It\u2019s gonna be 5k minimum. For flights. \ud83e\udd27\ud83d\ude37", "> I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019ll still be getting snide remarks from SIL of them questioning how come I\u2019m still taking care of the cats when I\u2019m struggling with money.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you are, but here the rescue will pay for costs if you can\u2019t afford it - they need foster homes & can raise donations to offset the costs.", "Ok as for the excuse for how you\u2019re still taking care of the Cats when the $ has gone down.  Come to say that since you\u2019ve been fostering so long and such on your dime that the organization as well as other fosters have come to your aid in time of need helping with supplies bc they know how much this means to you!  Also that is not non conceivable due to how that community is that helps foster.  Which would make SIL recognize that you\u2019re getting help from others to keep this up that she can see you don\u2019t have the extra $.  \n\nI hate to say I don\u2019t really have a relationship with family due to around the same means.  I was Mr money bags for a long while when they ever ran into trouble.  After a lot went down medically and current situation in housing trying to get back on our feet I don\u2019t have it.  Among other things I\u2019ve been basically cut off with contact.  I don\u2019t doubt that in the future when things are better w $ on our side they will rear their heads again.  I know true colors and choose what I will at that moment.  I had to learn at a early age family is what you choose and sometimes blood (family) is thinner that water.  I have my wife and I\u2019m perfectly happy with just us and friends.  I know circumstances are different for everyone, but if they continue the way they are ask if they put money first or a relationship with you.  No one likes to be put on the spot, but they need to see what they are doing looking in a mirror.  I\u2019ve seen many share the post after a long while with their peoples that need to reflect.  It made them realize a lot of what they were doing when they didn\u2019t want to see it for themselves.  While I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right choice for now..  they still need to see it from your shoes.. all parties involved to see how unfair this whole thing is.\n\nPs.  I know you said your parents helped him during that period and now it\u2019s your turn?  Who made the rules on that??  If he is not willing to do for his own and to place the responsibilities on you for financial help.. that\u2019s not fair at all.", "Say that your boyfriend is helping out with the cost of fostering cats because he can't do it at his house even though he really wants to (obviously ask boyfriend to help with lie so he knows beforehand).  It then becomes will your SIL and brother dare to ask boyfriend for money and then he could scare them off with interest contracts or signed agreements putting their house on the line if they don't repay haha.\n\nObviously if your boyfriend has a hard time saying no to people, then this isn't feasible, but it's an idea.", "> My parents reasoning is that they already helped my brother a lot during his schooling and his business that he has now , and now it\u2019s my turn to help.\n\nWHAT? Why is it your turn to help him??? You didn't give birth to your brother and you are not responsible for him and his family?\n\nDid/does anyone help you?", "Do what is best for you. Seriously, you have one life. Do not live with regrets, do things that make you happy. It may be hard but cut your family off and fill your life with people that respect and support you.", "It's not your turn to provide for your brother.  Your brother can't afford his lifestyle if your SIL is obsessing over any money you spend that she thinks she should have.\n\nNext time SIL asks you for money tell her to discuss finances with her husband.  When she starts arguing tell her that its clear to you that the elephant in the room is that they can't afford their lifestyle and while you feel sorry for the children, in your opinion their parents need to work harder and generate their own income to match their desired lifestyle.\n\nIf she keeps arguing.  \"Look all my life I'm known my brother was a loser and while I feel sorry for you, when you married him you agreed to become Mrs Loser.  For better or for worse.", "NTA in any way, shape or form. I would like to see kitty pictures but I understand you are not showing the shelter, etc.", "NTA. But stop letting people know you have any spare money and start calling to ask them for money. Act broke.", "\u00a0\u201cthe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\u201d"]}
