I\u2019ve mentioned that I\u2019ve slept over at theirs in a diff thread, and leaving tends to be as awkward.

If someone is drinking enough at your home that they would not be able to drive, you need to be proactive about making sure they can stay with you or they have an alternative way home.

We\u2019re they drinking?", "Were you drinking and were your plans primarily around drinking / hanging out? If yes, does your friend group usually crash at whoever's house is hosting if that's the primary activity?\n\nBecause it sounds like you're being awfully coy and you knew they might have assumed they were spending the night, but decided not to proactively say anything and just let them assume.", "ohh okok that clears it up, definitely odd that theyd just assume to stay when home was close enough", "It's still not your fault. They were being unreasonable guests. If they didn't say anything about staying the night before they got there you had no reason to think it would be an issue that could come up.", "I doubt there will be many future plans", "Yeah, no, the problem is *not* your communication. Are you going to add \"but you can't sleep at my house\" to all your evening plans from here on in? That is something you *should* be able to safely take as a given. I've *never* had friends specify that, and yet it's understood. \n\nYour friends are either just plain weird, or they have a very different circle of friends they *usually* hang out with, where the assumption is that everyone crashes at everyone else's house, and they just thought that was how *everyone* did things. If it's the latter, I'd cut them some slack, but otherwise? No.", "Hey, sisters need to stick together! I actually drove home after they left one time because I had a catering gig the next morning.

At this point I just wanted them to leave.", "Wtf? I crash at friends houses all time with a 30 minute drive. \n\nBecause we're drinking.", "Yup, we had drinks. No, the plans were primarily us catching up (alcohol optional). No, our nights (with all my friends) usually end with drawn-out goodbyes outside the host\u2019s home. Then a lot of \u201ctext when you\u2019re home safe.\u201d\n\nNope, my guest room only has a bed for one person, which they\u2019ve seen before. So apart from assuming they\u2019d spend the night, it also looks like they assumed I\u2019d let them sleep in my bed. Those are bold and unrealistic assumptions, I think.", "Yes that's really odd.  If I thought I was staying over at a friends (lol well first up I'd make sure THAT was the plan way a head of time) but I'd have my overnight bag with me when I came in the door and ask where I should put it, before starting our fun.  \n\nI could see that if the guests got too drunk to drive home safely a friend would insist they stay on the couch / a sleeping bag etc and boot their hungover butts out the next morning when you needed to leave, but it doesn't sound like That was the case either.", "This reminds me of the old SNL bit \"the things that wouldn't leave.\" \n\nPer Miss Manners: thank them for coming by and wish them a safe trip home. If that doesn't work, Clean up any mess from entertaining. Next step, vacuum the floor. If they still don't take the hint, tell them you are saying good night and to please remember to lock the door when they leave. Then turn out the lights and go to bed.", "I\u2019m glad this works for you. Unfortunately, I believe that if you\u2019re gonna make an active decision to drink over the driving limit, it\u2019s also your responsibility to make sure you have a plan to get home safely. There are exceptions to this though, because life happens.", "So you were completely surprised by their assumption? Like no idea they would have thought that?", "That\u2019s true. Spontaneous sleepovers can happen after many drinks, but this is usually extended by the host (when it\u2019s clearly dangerous for them to leave). But taking time to pack a bag, and not taking time to tell the host you\u2019re sleeping over is bizarre.", "My grandpa was known to say to his wife, \u201cwe\u2019d better go to bed so these people can leave.\u201d", "Naw my friends and I are cool with people crashing, if you're invited over for an evening it's assumed you have a place to stay unless work is an issue.\n\n'The plan' is my guest room or an air mattress. \n\nIf you don't have a free bed then that's one thing, but we all have houses now, so that that isn't an issue.", "Yes, naturally. It wasn\u2019t communicated.\n\nBut I feel like you already have an opinion about me, and that\u2019s okay.", "lol a bit 'Oh yeah we're BOTH planning getting wasted tonight and crash at your place but we're not going to mention it till around 11:45pm'", "That's a good line! I might steal it. With friends I just smile apologetically and say, \"I gotta kick you out now.\"", "But it's implicitly agreed upon, you have a well established story with these people. If you visited people whose habits you were less familiar with, would you assume it would be the same or clarify prior?", "We have different takes on this, and that\u2019s fine.", "NTA and no I genuinely don't have much of an opinion on you. At a glance at your post history and I think you're probably in the right here. I just couldn't get a sense of what was actually going on given that your comments seemed pretty unclear and a lot of people here try to leave out stuff they know is super relevant. In your case, I think they were making big assumptions and maybe your communication styles were so different that you didn't pick up on it, but that's on them.", "Honestly I can't imagine spending an evening with a couple or single friend that I wasn't familiar enough to have this expectation. \n\nLike I wouldn't be at your house by myself on Friday night if we weren't that close.", "I'm pretty sure you two are on the same page here and you're both talking about it slightly differently.", "I respect that. I can see why people would leave out important bits, but I genuinely wanted to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable so I can work on being a better friend.", "No I don't think you're being unreasonable, I think they are."]}
