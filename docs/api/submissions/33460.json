I think that he needs to be treated equally with the other step-siblings (your kids) who are present; otherwise, it's just not right.\n\nPlease talk with your husband and help him see that it is not about the ex husband.

Is he suffering depression?  Maybe you should get in contact with his sister or his parents to have someone make sure he is okay - because if he is alone on Christmas, and not doing well financially; someone might need to check in on him to make sure there's no tragedy this Christmas; wherein your step-son could become your son.\n\nI realize that's a leap in thought - but during this time of year; some people really suffer hardship and depression.  Alone on Christmas, away from his child; could these be warning signs that your ex isn't okay in a big way?

It was a last minute thing, and no one was really expecting me, but because they're all amazing people, no one batted an eye. When everyone was opening gifts, her grandma handed me an envelope with my name on it. It was a book of McDonald's coupons (this was the early 90s when that kind of thing was common around Christmas). She wanted me to have something to open, so she found a little something that she had sitting around so I didn't feel left out. \n\nAt my family's annual Christmas gathering, I never had a gift to open. It wasn't until I was a teenager that they told me these were gifts from godparents to godchildren, and that I never had gifts because my godparents weren't an aunt and uncle or something. It really sucked to be the only kid without a gift, not knowing why. \n\nLong story short, get the kid some things that will fit in his luggage on the way home.
