We separated when they were 6 months and 2 years old, divorced at 1 and 3, and he remarried when they were 3 and 5. I've never gotten along with his wife because she seems convinced that she's my kids' mom. It's only gotten worse since I remarried and moved. \n\nI tried to get primary custody of the kids when I moved but both of the kids asked to stay with their dad and their lawyer argued that they'd have to share a room with my stepkids and go to public school at my house while their dad has a house triple the size of mine where they'll have their own rooms and they'd go to a good private school so I ended up getting them every other weekend. \n\nTheir stepmom used to contact me constantly about foods they like/don't like/are sensitive to, not wanting the kids to have to share their toys, keeping an eye out for teasing by my stepkids (nothing happened, my 10 yo is just sensitive), and using something like a night light/white noise machine at night. Every time I tell her to back off and I know what I'm doing with my own kids but she never listens. Then she started picking them up instead of their dad. I told her I wouldn't let the kids go with anyone but their dad and they actually took me to court over this and had my custody reduced to visitation at their house for almost 2 years. \n\nNow I have them every other weekend again and I started to realize they call their stepmom mommy/mama, they don't call me anything, and they only call my husband by his first name. I tried to correct them every time they called her mom but she'd give me a look and tell them it was okay and that they could call her whatever they want. \n\nI eventually told them not to bother visiting if they insist on calling another woman mom but won't even call me mom. They haven't visited or called in over a month. Part of me thinks they turned the kids against us and wants to go to court for parental alienation but part of me just wants to let go and focus on my new family.

We separated when they were 6 months and 2 years old, divorced at 1 and 3, and he remarried when they were 3 and 5. I've never gotten along with his wife because she seems convinced that she's my kids' mom. It's only gotten worse since I remarried and moved. \n\nI tried to get primary custody of the kids when I moved but both of the kids asked to stay with their dad and their lawyer argued that they'd have to share a room with my stepkids and go to public school at my house while their dad has a house triple the size of mine where they'll have their own rooms and they'd go to a good private school so I ended up getting them every other weekend. \n\nTheir stepmom used to contact me constantly about foods they like/don't like/are sensitive to, not wanting the kids to have to share their toys, keeping an eye out for teasing by my stepkids (nothing happened, my 10 yo is just sensitive), and using something like a night light/white noise machine at night. Every time I tell her to back off and I know what I'm doing with my own kids but she never listens. Then she started picking them up instead of their dad. I told her I wouldn't let the kids go with anyone but their dad and they actually took me to court over this and had my custody reduced to visitation at their house for almost 2 years. \n\nNow I have them every other weekend again and I started to realize they call their stepmom mommy/mama, they don't call me anything, and they only call my husband by his first name. I tried to correct them every time they called her mom but she'd give me a look and tell them it was okay and that they could call her whatever they want. \n\nI eventually told them not to bother visiting if they insist on calling another woman mom but won't even call me mom. They haven't visited or called in over a month. Part of me thinks they turned the kids against us and wants to go to court for parental alienation but part of me just wants to let go and focus on my new family.

Tells them she doesn\u2019t want to see them because they call the woman who has helped raise them since they were toddlers mom.

She said this about her daughter \"nothing happened, she's just being sensitive\". Meaning, something upset her daughter and the mom completely invalidated and dismissed her.

She mentions the stepmother checking in about possible bullying by the stepsiblings. Obviously we don't know the truth of it, but OP was really dismissive about it in the post. Did OP make sure her kids weren't being bullied or did she do the bare minimum and just ask the step kids? From her description,  OP seems a lot less hands-on of a mom than stepmom so it wouldn't surprise me if the bio kids were having a terrible time over there and she had no idea.  \n\nBut yeah, if it's just about the room and the school,  that's doesn't seem like enough of a reason to give OP less than 50/50 custody", "OP said she tried to get primary custody when she moved...  I presume that meant her new house would be too far away to take them to the private school they were currently attending every day.\n\nIt's a bit insane she thought that would actually work.  She had limited custody, and thought that a court would side with her removing the kids from their school AND changing who the primary parent was, just because she wanted to move away?  \n\nA judge is going to value stability in a child's life...  the fact OP thought this was an appropriate request probably sealed her fate with a judge.  That clearly isn't in the best interest of the children.", "There\u2019s not necessarily anything wrong with sharing a room, but the way OP words it, it sounds like both of them would be sharing a room with her stepkids, so potentially four kids in one room? \n\nEither that or she\u2019s splitting them up so it\u2019s 1 bio kid and 1 step kid per room. Add into the fact that the stepkids seem to tease the 10 year old and op doesn\u2019t mention their ages, it doesn\u2019t sound like a reasonable ask to be honest.", "Yep. She's very clearly resentful, has very clearly BEEN resentful from the get-go, and is painting herself in a positive light. What you saw here is the positive light.\n\nI'm wondering if the kids' decision was due more to that than to sharing rooms.", "OP is YTA for telling her kids not to talk to her for calling another woman Mom, but in her defence, this whole situation sounds like it could be a very dysfunctional multi-family dynamic. If bio dad is wealthy, I sincerely hope he is providing the kids with ongoing mental health care along with the big house and private school. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t say what the custody arrangements were prior to her move, how far away her new home is, the relationship the kids have with their new stepdad, nor if her daughters have other step-siblings or half-siblings. These are all things that could factor into the current situation. \n\nOP\u2019s best move now is to start repairing the relationship with her kids.

She was notified that her daughter was upset about being teased by her steps, but called her daughter \"sensitive\" instead of taking it seriously. Her reaction to being given health info from the step mom was to tell her to \"back off\", and she is willing to forgo all visitation from her children because they don't call her mom. Furthermore, she had her custody reduced for 2 years to visits at the dad's house, which doesn't happen without good reason.\n\nNowhere in the post does she talk about how much she loves and misses her kids.

Considering the other parents house is 3x larger im gonna make an educated guess that her house is very small and she's expecting 4 children to share a very small room.

Another study showed that only 8% of fathers pursued custody, but of those 8%, 79% received joint or full. The myth that fathers never get custody is pervasive and negative.
