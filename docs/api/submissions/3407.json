My MIL has been away for awhile now, so I offered for her to go in the car with my wife, kids, and dog, while I took another car and followed behind. \n\nWhile at the Christmas tree lot, very predictably our daughter tripped and fell face first into a large puddle. Also very predictably, we had not brought any kind of change of clothes, so that effectively ended our afternoon of \u201cmaking memories.\u201d\n\nI carried our daughter back to our car and put her in while my wife and MIL got our son and dog and put them in the car. As we were leaving, they said they had to stop on the way home and then would be right there. I went right home and got a bath ready for our daughter and started prepping for supper. A little while later my wife came in the door with our daughter followed by my MIL with our son. All was good for over an hour until at one point my MIL looked around and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the dog?\u201d At that point i realised that I hadn\u2019t seen the dog since the dog went into the car at the tree lot. \n\nMy wife and I ran to the car, threw open the hatchback and there was our dog laying down in the back. Thankfully she was unharmed and just seemed bored. \n\nHere\u2019s where I get upset. This is the THIRD time that my wife has accidentally left our dog in the car for an extended period of time. We have been very fortunate that every time she has done so, it has been a comfortable temperature outside and a window has been down for the dog to breathe. So, given that this was the third time, I was very pissed and I let her know it right away. \n\nMy wife explained it was because she had both kids and our daughter was mostly naked because we stripped off her wet clothes before we put her in the car. She was focused on that and not on our dog. \n\nI decided to go for a walk because I was pissed off and wanted some space. My wife followed me and said she wanted to discuss it at that moment. So, standing outside, I told her how I was pissed at her and her mom because our dog could have died, again, from her not paying attention. She again said that she was busy with the kids and it wasn\u2019t on purpose so I shouldn\u2019t be mad at her. We came to a bit of a standstill and I said I needed to go for a walk so I could clear my head. Her mom was watching the kids in the house while this was happening. \n\nWhen I got back, my MIL was gone, so my wife and I talked everything through and came to a resolution. \n\nHowever, later on that night my wife was talking to her mother on the phone about what happened.  Her mother firmly believes that I am in the wrong and that I should not have made my wife feel worse for forgetting the dog, that I had no right to be angry, and that I should apologise to her, my MIL, for being upset at my wife when she, my MIL, was in our house.\n\nHer reaction got me thinking, AITA?\n\nEdit: here\u2019s some more info people had been asking about\n\nI wish Reddit allowed for more characters because a lot of details you asked about I couldn\u2019t include. So, really here is the main parts of the story I had to cut out for length.\n\nPacking the kids up to go was an all hands on deck. I got my daughter dressed while my wife got my son dressed.  I loaded my daughter into the car to go, and the dog, while my wife helped my son into his car seat. I had grabbed the poop bags for the dog, wrapped them around her leash, and put the leash on the dog. When everyone was settled then we left for the tree farm.\n\nWhen we were at the farm I took my daughter in one arm and the dog in the other so my wife, son, and MIL could find the best tree for both homes. Thankfully we found two very quickly, tagged them, and told the guy we\u2019d be back in a few weeks to chop them down. That\u2019s when the kids started running up and down the dirt lane and my daughter fell in the puddle.\n\nWe had backed the diaper bag and my wife and I looked at each other when she fell and immediately knew we had left it again by the door at home. This was not the first time we had done this. I scooped her up and carried her back to the car and stripped her down. We put a warm blanket that we had in the car over her so she wouldn\u2019t be cold and I then put the dog in the car while my MIL put our son in his car seat.\n\nWe both left at the same time, and about 5 minutes from home I noticed that my wife was in a turning lane at an intersection as opposed to the lane she should have been in. I called her and she said they had to stop by her moms to grab the fish for supper and that I should run a bath and start working on the veggies when I get home. So, that\u2019s what I did.\n\nWhen they came home, my wife came in with our daughter and my MIL had brought in our son. I put our daughter in the bath and gave her a quick wipe down to get the mud off while my wife took over some of dinner prep. When I finished, my MIL took over playing with both kids while my wife and I finished supper. That\u2019s when my MIL noticed the dog missing.\n\nI hope that helps clarify some of your points and questions.

You didn\u2019t suggest that your wife and her mother take your car while you took everyone else home, as she said they had to stop somewhere before you left the Christmas tree place. Instead you drove home, started a bath, and began dinner. \n\nYou had no idea your wife was home until they were all in the house. \n\nWhen she got in, did you take over the care of your child who needed a bath, did you take the wet clothes and put them in the wash, take care of the other child?  Or did your wife and mother in law?\n\nShe left the dog in the car because I\u2019m guessing the dog was asleep and your wife was focused on her children, specifically the half naked child who was probably cold and upset. Not because she\u2019s a monster or can\u2019t be trusted, but because she was overwhelmed with responsibilities right then with no actual backup from you. \n\nWhich is also something your MiL has noticed. Her POV, she came to a family event that went sour, she saw her daughter, whos probably trying to (poorly) hide how overwhelmed she is and then she sees her daughter make a mistake after all that effort and instead of you looking for actual solutions to make it better or stepping outside yourself to think about *why* this has happened three times, you belittle her and make her feel like a failure as a person and a mother. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question:\nWhere is your responsibility and accountability in all of this?

That's easy to say with hindsight, but I can imagine the kids would want the dog with them - seems very likely anyway. \n\nHaving the dog ride home with her doesn't seem like it would be overly tiresome, especially since y'all seemed so worried about your daughter being in wet clothes in the cold that you wanted to leave immediately.

You've had this issue with her *twice* before... while it ultimately wasn't your responsibility, I feel like you could/should have been a bit more attentive in the fact that the dog didn't come in with your wife. If she left one of the kids in the car, I'm willing to bet that you would've asked where the other kid was. That's why I'm also leaning a little towards ESH. If she didn't have a history of this, I wouldn't have this leaning. \n\nBrief clarification: if your dog typically stays outside to where you wouldn't have noticed if she *did* get the dog out of the car, I would understand you not necessarily thinking about asking and assuming that the adult responsible for the dog did the responsible thing. \n\nIf your wife was feeling overwhelmed and didn't want to also deal with the dog, she should have spoken up because that's also understandable.

You may want to have a serious discussion with her about her reaction to your very understandable anger. \n\nAs for your MIL, she's just taking her daughter's side when quite frankly she should be upset with her daughter as well.

I don\u2019t want to get dramatic, but this sounds like a mini cry for help.. OP glosses over the fact that his wife explicitly stated that she was overwhelmed.. it makes me wonder what their conversation after his walk was about.. if it was an extension of \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed\u201d, and OP is still here saying \u201cshe forgot the dog 3 times!!\u201d, that\u2019s a problem.

I can't believe some of these responses. OP was not driving the car with the dog in it. His wife was and should have been trusted to get the dog in and out of the car.

I'm more stuck on your wife having all of the responsibility here, having a dozen things to remember, and you getting angry at her, which is not useful to anyone. Maybe you can be more mindful in the future about not putting everything on your wife's plate or at least helping her mentally juggle all the balls by checking things yourself. We all screw up sometimes and it doesn't sound like your wife was shrugging it off. It sounds like she was also upset the dog got left in the car.

This was not the first time we had done this. I scooped her up and carried her back to the car and stripped her down. We put a warm blanket that we had in the car over her so she wouldn\u2019t be cold and I then put the dog in the car while my MIL put our son in his car seat. \n\nWe both left at the same time, and about 5 minutes from home I noticed that my wife was in a turning lane at an intersection as opposed to the lane she should have been in. I called her and she said they had to stop by her moms to grab the fish for supper and that I should run a bath and start working on the veggies when I get home. So, that\u2019s what I did. \n\nWhen they came home, my wife came in with our daughter and my MIL had brought in our son. I put our daughter in the bath and gave her a quick wipe down to get the mud off while my wife took over some of dinner prep.

I think that focusing on both the kids, especially the daughter, is a weak excuse since the hectic part with the daughter took place before they got in the car, and there were no problems with getting the dog *in* the car. The problem is with getting the dog *out* of the car, and daughter was already clean and warm inside with OP before the wife got home. Clearly she wasn\u2019t too worried about the daughter anymore because she was confident enough to make a stop on the way home and let the husband handle it. The only thing she had to focus on when getting home was bringing the dog in, and maybe getting the son in if he\u2019s not old enough to do so himself. \n\nBecause of that, I don\u2019t think it was fair for her to say he can\u2019t be mad at her.

Or grab the dog while leaving my children completely to my wife.\n\nThis man did so little and some of y'all want to give him a trophy.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous that anyone would think this was a fair split of the work, or even close enough that he should get to dress down his wife for the dog he also did not get out of the car and also didn't even bother to bring home.\n\nWhy were all the actually stressful jobs up solely to his wife?!", "He claims to be a very hands on dad in another comment but doesn't have car seats in his car. Hmm.... Sorry, I just disagree with you on this. He seems to have dumped all of the responsibility on his wife and acts like he's helpful by turning on the bathtub", "Are you saying popping outside to help upload is some super hard trial?", "Exactly.", "There is no reason why he could not have taken the dog, or taken the wet kid home himself so the others could finish the errand.  There's no excuse for how little help he was here.  \n\nDon't try to act like somehow his dodging all responsibility here was altruistic.", "If my dog could\u2019ve died twice I would drive the car with my dog period and he didn\u2019t notice the dog was gone, the MIL did so it kind\u2019ve in my opinion invalidated his judgment when he\u2019s not even aware the dog wasn\u2019t there, at least he should\u2019ve noticed if he\u2019s going to be angry at his wife when he himself didn\u2019t notice.", "What are you even talking about, I care about a dog dying in a hot car eventually obviously, he should obviously drive the car with the dog inside to prevent a tragedy obviously, that\u2019s my concern obviously and you\u2019re making no sense obviously, bcuz we are all concerned about the same thing obviously, what are you even going on about?", "Exactly. The daughters fall was \"very predictable\", meaning op thinks someone should have predicted it and brought clothes, but apparently not him, because he never blames himself. \n\nHis entire op has the ironic and amused tone of an emotionally detached elderly British bachelor telling his friends why he will never wed or have children, only he IS married and HAS children, which makes the story and the emotional detachment less funny and more sad.", "I don\u2019t double check everything my partner does. I trust them, and that\u2019s usually reasonable (as I suspect it is for OP). \n\nWhy don\u2019t you think he should trust his wife? Yes, the trust was misplaced. No, he\u2019s not an asshole for it.", "I dont know what point you think your making? Yes she could have asked him, but considering she later forgot the dog in the car, i imagine she was a little scattered and didnt think to ask. Either way, she could have asked or he could have offered, and this situation could have been avoided", "I'm pretty sure the trip ended because it was cold and the kid fell into a mud puddle. Wet + cold and no change of clothing means it's time to go home.", "I suspect they have car seats in the wife's car. Changing them over when you have a wet, cold, upset child would be a ball ache.\n\nDepending on the space, he should have taken the dog tho. It's easy to forget things when you have a 'kid emergency' but it is worrying that the dog has been forgotten 3 times now.", "Yes I see that now hence the edit at the top of my comment, where I said they were now equal assholes. He should\u2019ve taken the dog, and she did indeed have a lot to focus on. Don\u2019t think she takes most of the blame anymore.", "Two grown adults can't empty a car, you need three, or maybe four?", "Car seats (especially multiples) are expensive and take up a lot of space. My partner and I swap cars depending on who has the kids rather than each have two car seats. I also know people that have cars for work that don't really fit car seats either. \n\nSeems a bit of a reach to say he's a bad dad based on what is here, he's NTA for being mad about the dog.", "There's no evidence of that? He said HE took their daughter back to the car, got her out of her wet clothes and got her bundled in a blanket for the ride. HE put the dog in the car. She put their son in his car seat. He was expecting them to get home at the same time (where presumably he would have been right there to help unload everyone as well), but she made an extra stop, so he got everything ready for them for when they got back. There is zero evidence that he intended to leave her with all the responsibility. In fact, if anything, getting the bath ready before they were back shows more initiative and involvement than many men (this is not meant as high praise - it's just being a parent, which many men seem to struggle with). I just don't buy that the wife driving the car with the dog in it or only owning one set of car seats means she was being burdened. I suppose the wife and MIL could have taken the separate car, but if MIL wanted to spend time with the kids and/or the main car is nicer than the second car, this arrangement may have been wife and MIL's preference. \n\nIt's still not cool to put all the blame on her for forgetting the dog; the responsibility is about 60/40 on her in my mind. She was the one to unload, so she should have remembered to get the living being trapped in the car, and it's definitely an issue that she didn't (and apparently has done this repeatedly). They both should have noticed sooner that the dog was missing.", "Actually it\u2019s very possible his car doesn\u2019t have a child seat for the kids. And it might not be big enough for the dog. We don\u2019t know what kinds of cars they have. For all we know OP drives a 2 seat convertible that\u2019s can\u2019t hold anyone else but an adult human", "Damn. This whole thread is too real", "I mentioned to another comment, but we are a pretty unique situation car wise. We have two cars, but both work at the same school. My wife leaves earlier because her classes start earlier. So I\u2019m the morning she takes the car I took to go to the tree place, and I take the one with car seats to drop the kids off at daycare and school. Then, when she gets off earlier then me, she takes the car with car seats and picks them up and I take the car with no car seats home with me. It\u2019s a weird setup but explains why we only need one car with car seats.", "I love all these people referring to \u201cpreparing a bath\u201d like it\u2019s a PhD thesis.", "If she agrees to taking on the responsibility of her children and dog with the additional support of her mother who babysits regularly, doesn\u2019t communicate that it would be too much for her, and forgets the dog for the third time\u2026. Is she not to blame?? If it\u2019s too overwhelming, tell your partner that. Communicate your needs. If it was a one time event, it would be understandable\u2026 3 times is not. It\u2019s careless.\n\nAlso, OP didn\u2019t just go home and flick on the football game\u2026 he got a bath ready and started dinner, with the expectation that he could trust his wife to get all breathing individuals out of the car. Not sure why he trusted that after the first or second time, but it\u2019s not an unrealistic expectation for someone to open a car door or hatch. Having the dog in the backseat added no responsibility other than allowing it to get out of the car.", "i guess \ud83d\udc81very possible I'm underreacting but when i was a kid tripping over like that would never mean we just go home immediately so that was odd to me", "He\u2019s added that when they left, they were both going straight home, his wife only detoured when they were on the way. He had no reason to think they wouldn\u2019t be arriving at the same time. \n\nHe may not have taken the kids or the dog because his car is not set up for them - a lot of families only have one set of car seats. And her car is the hatchback which is probably set up for the dog, hopefully with a tether of some sort. \n\nI\u2019m still inclined to go with ESH. Slightly more so the wife for not giving him the space he asked for. My ex used to peruse me to argue when I had asked for space, to the point of sleep deprivation on many occasions, then weaponise my anger against me.\nEdit - typo (s)he", "A dog cannot ride in a 2 seat convertible, fascinating", "Your wife had the children, her mum and the dog with her. What about you, who did you have in the car?", "It really doesn't. I do the vast majority of driving with children in my household. But not only does my husbands car have 2 age appropriate seats, but we also bought them for grandparents car. The spare ones are not high end, but they are safe.\n\nSo if there is an emergency (from me getting stuck in traffic to someone being sick) there are multiple options for other people to safely transport our children. \n\nI'll also add that we live on the same street as their school. So there's actually very few scenarios where there'd be an emergency that required them to be driven by husband/grandparents. But we've prepped just in case. (And a 'go bag' of spare clothes, snacks, art supplies live in each car. Just in case.)", "I love all these people referring to 2 adults getting 2 kids and a dog out of a car like it's a PhD thesis.", "Now hold on a minute.. OP said himself that his wife tried to explain to him that she was overwhelmed.. he brushed it off.. if it has happened this way the other two times (unbalanced load, wife makes a mistake, OP gets mad, wife expresses that she is overwhelmed, OP doesn\u2019t want to talk about it aka have a conversation to get to the root of this recurring issue and solve it even though she does), mmmmyeah, I\u2019m gonna put more of the blame on him.. the next best thing for his wife to do is to take him by the shoulders, shake him, and say \u201cI FORGOT THE DOG AGAIN BECAUSE IM OVERWHELMED AND YOU DIDNT HELP ME\u201d.. if he lets this chain of events happen again because he refuses to have a conversation with her (one where he can stay level-headed), how will it not be his fault if she messes something else up again?\n\nAlso, I DID take note of that. I don\u2019t think OP is a bad father or husband, BUT with a wife, a dog, and two kids, you gotta adjust a little more when unanticipated things happen.. yes - he ran a bath.. but there was a lot more going on than either of them had anticipated.. they BOTH need to improve on working together as a unit and their communication.. and that\u2019s not going to happen if he likes to walk off when they\u2019re having a problem.", "Where would you put the dog in such car? The passenger seat?", "Dogs, like small kids, should not ever be in the front seat. In the event of an accident, they can be easily thrown through the windshield or crushed by the airbag if one inflates.", "It sounds like she was helping mom actually and carrying in the kiddos. I wonder if MIL had a knee jerk reaction with the apology thing because she knows what it\u2019s like to be an overworked mom who\u2019s tired enough to forget things like that. Kinda just overprotective because she gets it? She doesn\u2019t sound like an animal abuser or neglectful, she sounds absolutely sleep deprived and stressed tf out", "Yep. My 160 pound bullmastiff rides in the front seat all the time.", "You never thought to move the seat back and down so she could fit in the footwell?

What about the back seat? Our dogs used to do that even if there was only the driver in the car. \n\nOr better yet, why the heck are you taking your dog with you anyway but didn\u2019t have the foresight to pack extra change of clothes for (presumably) young children?\n\nThis just feels like shite planning from all the adults involved.", "I have a GSD x husky cross that\u2019s built like a tank, he fits in the backseat. \n\nInfo: Does your car not have a trunk to put stuff in or is your car always a pigsty?"]}
