My MIL has been away for awhile now, so I offered for her to go in the car with my wife, kids, and dog, while I took another car and followed behind. \n\nWhile at the Christmas tree lot, very predictably our daughter tripped and fell face first into a large puddle. Also very predictably, we had not brought any kind of change of clothes, so that effectively ended our afternoon of \u201cmaking memories.\u201d\n\nI carried our daughter back to our car and put her in while my wife and MIL got our son and dog and put them in the car. As we were leaving, they said they had to stop on the way home and then would be right there. I went right home and got a bath ready for our daughter and started prepping for supper. A little while later my wife came in the door with our daughter followed by my MIL with our son. All was good for over an hour until at one point my MIL looked around and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the dog?\u201d At that point i realised that I hadn\u2019t seen the dog since the dog went into the car at the tree lot. \n\nMy wife and I ran to the car, threw open the hatchback and there was our dog laying down in the back. Thankfully she was unharmed and just seemed bored. \n\nHere\u2019s where I get upset. This is the THIRD time that my wife has accidentally left our dog in the car for an extended period of time. We have been very fortunate that every time she has done so, it has been a comfortable temperature outside and a window has been down for the dog to breathe. So, given that this was the third time, I was very pissed and I let her know it right away. \n\nMy wife explained it was because she had both kids and our daughter was mostly naked because we stripped off her wet clothes before we put her in the car. She was focused on that and not on our dog. \n\nI decided to go for a walk because I was pissed off and wanted some space. My wife followed me and said she wanted to discuss it at that moment. So, standing outside, I told her how I was pissed at her and her mom because our dog could have died, again, from her not paying attention. She again said that she was busy with the kids and it wasn\u2019t on purpose so I shouldn\u2019t be mad at her. We came to a bit of a standstill and I said I needed to go for a walk so I could clear my head. Her mom was watching the kids in the house while this was happening. \n\nWhen I got back, my MIL was gone, so my wife and I talked everything through and came to a resolution. \n\nHowever, later on that night my wife was talking to her mother on the phone about what happened.  Her mother firmly believes that I am in the wrong and that I should not have made my wife feel worse for forgetting the dog, that I had no right to be angry, and that I should apologise to her, my MIL, for being upset at my wife when she, my MIL, was in our house.\n\nHer reaction got me thinking, AITA?", "created_utc": 1669608315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6m8ka/aita_for_making_my_wife_and_mil_feel_worse_about/", "score": 929, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was focused on that and not on our dog.***\n\nOkay...let's say you and MIL weren't with wifey and kids. Daughter got wet & cold, wife was focused on her, getting her into house, running a bath etc. Forgets son in car, because she was so 'focused' on daughter and not son. That okay as long as the kid doesn't die? She is so forgetful and can get so focused on one thing that she forgets other LIVING things?

When they reach the destination, mom has to care for everyone while OP did not help to check on all passengers.

I\u2019m thinking all the 3 times have also been the same, mom being burdened by the mental load and has no capacity to function well. Yes, she feels bad. But you should be supporting her, helping her carry the excess mental load, you should not be blaming her. Hope OP can pick up on the mental load.

They were in charge of the dog and kids and all three should have been brought in by them.", "NTA for expressing your frustration for this on-going issue and for wanting to walk away to clear your head. It's not like you were just shutting down any conversation ever.\n\nYour wife doesn't want to feel bad for endangering the dog... again, so she gets mad at you. She vents to her mom and gets support from her but doesn't acknowledge to you that this has been a repeated problem that needs to be addressed nor that whatever her reasons, this keeps endangering the dog.\n\nIf... whatever... is repeatedly making it too difficult for your wife to remember she has the dog with her, then she needs to not take the dog with her.\n\nMaybe it would have been nice if you had kept the kids and the dog with you so that your wife and MIL could have had a nice kid/dog-free visit in the car. It would also be nice if you both kept a set of clothes in your cars for the 'inevitable' kid needing a change of clothes. Your wife may need a little parenting breather (which would be lovely of you to give her), but she needs to own her behavior in this instance... and stop looking to her mommy for validating her excuses.", "Isn't it your dog too? Why is it all on your wife and MIL when you could have just as easily gone to grab the dog out of the car while she is dealing with kids? You also could have reminded her. YTA in this instance because the dog is just as much your responsibility as hers, as are the children, so you have no right to get upset this time. If it's that big of a deal, don't take the dog with unless the trip is INTENDED FOR THE DOG. Crate train the dog or use doggy daycare.", "Switch cars. Take kids and dog home and let wife and MIL go where they need to go. \n\nMove the car seat from one car to another. I've done this when out with sister and I was the one needing to take her kid afterwards. \n\nHave a car seat in both cars. If you can afford another car seat get one so you can always take care of your kid.\n\nIt's easier to get dinner and a bath ready when someone else is taking care of your kids, which is understandable to do when dividing duties, but getting angry at the way your wife took care of your kids while you had the easier duties is an AH move.\n\nEdit: spelling and clarity", "nta the dog could have died and she didnt seem to care", "Everyone sucks.

Leaving a dog in the car is not the same as leaving a child, but it's close.  Dogs are completely dependent on owners and are happy to be so.  Owning a dog is a commitment to care for it in exchange for the total love and devotion that is eagerly given to you.  Wife is making excuses.   Explaining to her isn't going to solve the problem.   The reality is that both of you need to take the care of the dog more seriously.   She had the dog and should have brought it into the house.  You should have asked about where the dog is when everyone came into the house.", "NTA.

What exactly do you co tribute to your children's care?", "YTA. She was literally taking care of the kids while you got out and took a bath. A part of marriage is the whole partnership part.

You didn\u2019t suggest that your wife and her mother take your car while you took everyone else home, as she said they had to stop somewhere before you left the Christmas tree place. Instead you drove home, started a bath, and began dinner. \n\nYou had no idea your wife was home until they were all in the house. \n\nWhen she got in, did you take over the care of your child who needed a bath, did you take the wet clothes and put them in the wash, take care of the other child?  Or did your wife and mother in law?\n\nShe left the dog in the car because I\u2019m guessing the dog was asleep and your wife was focused on her children, specifically the half naked child who was probably cold and upset. Not because she\u2019s a monster or can\u2019t be trusted, but because she was overwhelmed with responsibilities right then with no actual backup from you. \n\nWhich is also something your MiL has noticed. Her POV, she came to a family event that went sour, she saw her daughter, whos probably trying to (poorly) hide how overwhelmed she is and then she sees her daughter make a mistake after all that effort and instead of you looking for actual solutions to make it better or stepping outside yourself to think about *why* this has happened three times, you belittle her and make her feel like a failure as a person and a mother. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question:\nWhere is your responsibility and accountability in all of this?

I don\u2019t want to get dramatic, but this sounds like a mini cry for help.. OP glosses over the fact that his wife explicitly stated that she was overwhelmed.. it makes me wonder what their conversation during their walk was about.. if it was an extension of \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed\u201d, and OP is still here saying \u201cshe forgot the dog 3 times!!\u201d, that\u2019s a problem.

Maybe you can be more mindful in the future about not putting everything on your wife's plate or at least helping her mentally juggle all the balls by checking things yourself.

When I get home from an outing I\u2019m usually lugging kids and items in and if my husband isn\u2019t already outside to help, he asks if there\u2019s anything else that needs to come in.", "Thats where I'm at. I understand getting tired, but OP was not in the car, not driving the car, and was at home preparing a bath for the daughter. The wife was driving the car and the only actual owner of the dog in the car. It was her responsibility to get the dog out of the car.", "If he lets her take on the family load while he\u2019s just responsible for himself and doesn\u2019t offer to take a couple things off her hands and she ends up forgetting the dog a FOURTH time, is he still blameless?", "Unless it's a working farm dog the concept of \"outside dogs\" is abuse. And that's only because then it's the farm's dog, not yours, and it doesn't have that same attachment to the people as a pet does.", "The comments by AITA posters are always way more telling than the post itself.. you can start to sniff out the nuances of their character..\n\n\u201cwe live in a big old house, so it\u2019s very quiet\u201d\n\nEither this post is fake, or OP is trying to give us the run around and make all the excuses he can to not be seen as the asshole.. even if they\u2019re poorly researched lies.. so far, he seems the type to not take responsibility for as much as he should.. I\u2019m more inclined to take the wife\u2019s side", "What\u2019s it framed with? Wood?\n\nIs it over a basement? crawlspace? or slab-on-grade?", "Unless it's a literal freak of nature, it'll fit in any average sedan's back seat. I grew up with a large rottie and spent a lot of time with a bull mastiff. Both were big fucking dogs, don't get me wrong, but they can fit in a space made for 2-3 adults without a problem.", "Do you think you put all of the mental load on your wife?  Meaning, does she have to plan all the errands, plan how to pick up/drop off kids, is she the only one who\u2019s expected to remember the dog, etc?\n\nFrom this post, it definitely sounds like it.  If that\u2019s the case then you\u2019re making her plan and remember way too much stuff.  You need to take up a lot of slack.", "I love that you are willing to hear others opinions!  It is hard to admit fault, even partial fault  so many people come on and try to argue with everyone.", "FFS. It was a joke, but honestly, all the burden can\u2019t be placed on one person, and then have the one person pay the price when they inevitably miss something. Very helpful of you though to choose a single point from my comment and try to pick the whole thing apart without even  bothering to try to understand the rest of it.  \u270c\ufe0f", "Me LMAOOOO", "I\u2019m pointing out that if he knew she was coming home, with all these things to handle (cause who knows what else she brought with her, purse/wallet/whatever she uses, whatever the kids brought, wet clothes from a child, plus the children themselves) he could have made himself more available to help her when she got home. Instead he\u2019s in here with 100+ excuses as to why he wasn\u2019t able to help her, but he got so irrationally angry he had to physically leave the house, and yelled at her. \n\nLike, that\u2019s an insane response when all he had to do was be a little bit more available to her, especially if he knows the dog isn\u2019t her priority over the kids!", "This sub is just vehemently anti-man in such scenarios. \nWhy not move stuff from one car to another? \nThey have a soaked child during winter. That's not the time to move car seats. Or secure a smaller car for a dog. If anything they should've communicated so he ran the errand the rest went home. Even then the dog would be left in the car.\n\nSeriously if one person is doing chores at home, depending on the layout it might be hard to see if the dogs have come in. \nSomeone funked up here and it wasn't him. Yet the sub will pull at threads to make him at fault.\nThe same doesn't happen if the genders are reversed. If he were just sitting at home and not doing chores I'd call him the asshole, but he isn't in this situation.", "You don\u2019t have a passenger seat? Why even bring the dog when you know you\u2019re going to be coming back with two trees, two children, and a MIL? This all seems like poor planning all around on all sides. But YTA for yelling at your wife - that solves nothing.", "Ok, that\u2019s fair", "Not even! Cosco makes car seats for $60!", "The dog would absolutely not fit in the front seat and it would be very dangerous to try to fit her in. She\u2019s a big girl! Also, the decision to go look at tress wasn\u2019t last minute, but the inclusion of the MIL was. She wanted to ride in the car with the grandkids so we had to take the extra car. Hope that makes sense.", "Mine does this as well. It's just common sense and common etiquette in my opinion. It's teamwork.", "Agree here! No need to apologize to your MIL.", "The mom is not disabled. She is a functioning adult, not a source of extra work. She\u2019s the only one that noticed the missing dog.", "Why is everyone here acting like the MIL isn\u2019t an adult who can not only take care of herself, but an additional adult who could have helped with the kids and the dog?\n\nAges aren\u2019t stated, but with young grandkids, and with the MIL having been away for a while, she doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s particularly elderly or infirm.", "So if it wasn\u2019t last minute, why couldn\u2019t you remember to pack a change of clothes for your daughter? It\u2019s on you and your wife but this whole story put every responsibility on your wife.", "I mean, my parents had an extra larger German Shepherd and he rode in the front seat just fine. Im pretty sure ive also seen St. Bernard's in the front seat while driving around", "Alright OP, I\u2019ll bite, tell us what breed of dog it is, and/or how large she actually is.", "LET IT GO! I was JOKING. Sweet baby Jesus, move on from this. I made many other points.", "For me, it\u2019s more that MIL likely isn\u2019t part of any regular routine, therefore has to be asked/guided on how to help vs just knowing. She gets credit from me for being the one to realize the dog was mia!", "She\u2019s a 100lb sheepadoodle. She\u2019s very tall is the major issue. Picture more of a beautiful fluffy horse.", "Calm down, lol."]}
