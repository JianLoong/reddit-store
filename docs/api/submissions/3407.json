My MIL has been away for awhile now, so I offered for her to go in the car with my wife, kids, and dog, while I took another car and followed behind. \n\nWhile at the Christmas tree lot, very predictably our daughter tripped and fell face first into a large puddle. Also very predictably, we had not brought any kind of change of clothes, so that effectively ended our afternoon of \u201cmaking memories.\u201d\n\nI carried our daughter back to our car and put her in while my wife and MIL got our son and dog and put them in the car. As we were leaving, they said they had to stop on the way home and then would be right there. I went right home and got a bath ready for our daughter and started prepping for supper. A little while later my wife came in the door with our daughter followed by my MIL with our son. All was good for over an hour until at one point my MIL looked around and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the dog?\u201d At that point i realised that I hadn\u2019t seen the dog since the dog went into the car at the tree lot. \n\nMy wife and I ran to the car, threw open the hatchback and there was our dog laying down in the back. Thankfully she was unharmed and just seemed bored. \n\nHere\u2019s where I get upset. This is the THIRD time that my wife has accidentally left our dog in the car for an extended period of time. We have been very fortunate that every time she has done so, it has been a comfortable temperature outside and a window has been down for the dog to breathe. So, given that this was the third time, I was very pissed and I let her know it right away. \n\nMy wife explained it was because she had both kids and our daughter was mostly naked because we stripped off her wet clothes before we put her in the car. She was focused on that and not on our dog. \n\nI decided to go for a walk because I was pissed off and wanted some space. My wife followed me and said she wanted to discuss it at that moment. So, standing outside, I told her how I was pissed at her and her mom because our dog could have died, again, from her not paying attention. She again said that she was busy with the kids and it wasn\u2019t on purpose so I shouldn\u2019t be mad at her. We came to a bit of a standstill and I said I needed to go for a walk so I could clear my head. Her mom was watching the kids in the house while this was happening. \n\nWhen I got back, my MIL was gone, so my wife and I talked everything through and came to a resolution. \n\nHowever, later on that night my wife was talking to her mother on the phone about what happened.  Her mother firmly believes that I am in the wrong and that I should not have made my wife feel worse for forgetting the dog, that I had no right to be angry, and that I should apologise to her, my MIL, for being upset at my wife when she, my MIL, was in our house.\n\nHer reaction got me thinking, AITA?", "created_utc": 1669608315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6m8ka/aita_for_making_my_wife_and_mil_feel_worse_about/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Daughter got wet & cold, wife was focused on her, getting her into house, running a bath etc. Forgets son in car, because she was so 'focused' on daughter and not son. That okay as long as the kid doesn't die? She is so forgetful and can get so focused on one thing that she forgets other LIVING things?

You need to start leaving your pup at home for their own safety until you both get it together.

She\u2019s in the car with an elderly (mil), 2 young kids, and a pet. OP is in the car with nothing. When they reach the destination, mom has to care for everyone while OP did not help to check on all passengers.

I\u2019m thinking all the 3 times have also been the same, mom being burdened by the mental load and has no capacity to function well. Yes, she feels bad. But you should be supporting her, helping her carry the excess mental load, you should not be blaming her. Hope OP can pick up on the mental load.

They were in charge of the dog and kids and all three should have been brought in by them.", "NTA for expressing your frustration for this on-going issue and for wanting to walk away to clear your head. It's not like you were just shutting down any conversation ever.\n\nYour wife doesn't want to feel bad for endangering the dog... again, so she gets mad at you. She vents to her mom and gets support from her but doesn't acknowledge to you that this has been a repeated problem that needs to be addressed nor that whatever her reasons, this keeps endangering the dog.\n\nIf... whatever... is repeatedly making it too difficult for your wife to remember she has the dog with her, then she needs to not take the dog with her.\n\nMaybe it would have been nice if you had kept the kids and the dog with you so that your wife and MIL could have had a nice kid/dog-free visit in the car. It would also be nice if you both kept a set of clothes in your cars for the 'inevitable' kid needing a change of clothes. Your wife may need a little parenting breather (which would be lovely of you to give her), but she needs to own her behavior in this instance... and stop looking to her mommy for validating her excuses.", "Isn't it your dog too? Why is it all on your wife and MIL when you could have just as easily gone to grab the dog out of the car while she is dealing with kids? You also could have reminded her. YTA in this instance because the dog is just as much your responsibility as hers, as are the children, so you have no right to get upset this time. If it's that big of a deal, don't take the dog with unless the trip is INTENDED FOR THE DOG. Crate train the dog or use doggy daycare.", "Switch cars. Take kids and dog home and let wife and MIL go where they need to go. \n\nMove the car seat from one car to another. I've done this when out with sister and I was the one needing to take her kid afterwards. \n\nHave a car seat in both cars. If you can afford another car seat get one so you can always take care of your kid.\n\nIt's easier to get dinner and a bath ready when someone else is taking care of your kids, which is understandable to do when dividing duties, but getting angry at the way your wife took care of your kids while you had the easier duties is an AH move.\n\nEdit: spelling and clarity", "nta the dog could have died and she didnt seem to care", "Everyone sucks.

You could have brought the change of clothes you apparently could predict she would need. But no Mr misogyny you expect your wife to take care of everything concerning your daughter as well as the dog. \n\nSure your wife fucked up.

Sounds like there are three people in this relationship where there should obviously only be two.  Your wife is the AH for leaving the dog in the car for the third time and for running to her mother with your relationship problems.

Leaving a dog in the car is not the same as leaving a child, but it's close.  Dogs are completely dependent on owners and are happy to be so.  Owning a dog is a commitment to care for it in exchange for the total love and devotion that is eagerly given to you.  Wife is making excuses.   Explaining to her isn't going to solve the problem.   The reality is that both of you need to take the care of the dog more seriously.   She had the dog and should have brought it into the house.  You should have asked about where the dog is when everyone came into the house.", "NTA.

What exactly do you co tribute to your children's care?", "YTA. She was literally taking care of the kids while you got out and took a bath. A part of marriage is the whole partnership part.

Please say something logical instead of making yourself look worse, as the explanation you gave is BS.", "If she was sorry and did care it wouldn\u2019t have happened again after the first time. I have kids and pets. Yes they are a lot to handle at the same time, but you do it because the consequences are life or death.", "This has happened 3 times. She doesn\u2019t care enough to double check. I\u2019ve lost a dog in a horrible situation caused by my ex wife. Next time you guys might not get so lucky.", "Since they had two separate cars, and one has children (including a now dirty-wet-not having a good time child) why didn\u2019t he think to take the dog? Or take the kids since wife said she had somewhere to stop on the way home? \n\nReal wack that OP is getting this mad when he doesn\u2019t help with her mental load. Upset kid > dog chillin in the car \n\nOP is TA since he\u2019s okay to yell at his wife but doesn\u2019t think to help her!", "Three times though? I get once maybe even twice... But three times? Is a pattern. Maybe she is not actively trying to kill the dog but certainly doesn't try to keep the dog alive either", "I found out about the errand while we were driving home. I didn\u2019t know about it until it was too late unfortunately.", "That\u2019s true. She could actually be mad at you because you left her with everything while you went home alone, even though you knew she had to do something.", "Unfortunately the dog is quite large and would t fit in the backseat of the car I took.", "Unfortunately I had to cut details to meet the 3000 character length. I also know it sounds like I\u2019m trying to backtrack by saying that I did say, \u201cOh,  she\u2019s in the front room\u201d but that really did happen. The quick run to the car was because I immediately did realise that I didn\u2019t see the dog in the front room and knew she would be in the car again.", "The OP has a vehicle that\u2019s incapable of transporting children and animals, making it an excellent car for a family.", "ONE OF MY POINTS EXACTLY!!!! Not to mention, it isn't hard to stop dinner for 2 minutes and help get people and animals out of the car.", "Sorry, I certainly did not mean to imply that you don\u2019t know how to read. Other people had similar questions and I might have misread your comment. I apologise for that. \n\nFrom where I was in the kitchen and bathroom, I couldn\u2019t see anyone come home. I only knew they were home when they essentially came into the room. Our house is a big old house so you don\u2019t really hear anything until someone is in the room with you. I didn\u2019t help bring the kids in because my wife and MIL had brought them inside by the time I even could have known they were home. Essentially my daughter was giving me a hug by the time I knew she was home. I hope that clarifies that aspect of the situation.", "I had to cut a lot of details unfortunately because of character count. The dog wouldn\u2019t fit in the car I took unfortunately and my car didn\u2019t have a car seat. I only found out that they were making an errand after we were driving and they called and told me, otherwise I would have run the errand myself.", "Op explain in the comments there was no space for car seats or dog in the second car. The only other option was he take the other car while his wife took the other one to start bath and dinner.", "NTA. These comments make me feel insane.", "Your dog won't fit in the back seat that would fit 2-3 humans? Sure, sounds plausible", "OK cool but you didn\u2019t check. You assumed. She forgot. You were both wrong. You shouldn\u2019t be mad at just her. You do hold some blame in the situation.\n\nMaybe y\u2019all need to start a new routine if this happens a lot. I don\u2019t know, put a sticky note on the front door that says did you remember the dog? until it\u2019s habit.", "Why didn\u2019t you help her when she got home then?", "Why didn\u2019t they empty the car before going to a tree farm? Don\u2019t most people make room in their cats before stuff like this, when you know you\u2019re going to be making a big purchase like this? \n\nWhy didn\u2019t he meet her outside to help her shuffle everyone in? Two kids AND a dog on top of that is a lot for one person to handle. Why is he not helping her?", "That is a very fair point. And you are absolutely right, perhaps some of this anger was a bit of projection because I am frustrated at myself for not double checking that she had everything. I also like the idea of the sticky note somewhere to remind everyone.", "So you double check every single thing your wife does with kids and dogs? \u2026 Sounds like you don\u2019t have any of the three. My wife would lose her mind if I double checked her every move. It sucks for his wife, but whoever takes the dog is responsible for it. \n\nSide note- I live the southwest, so this has to be taken very serious, even in winter.", "Oh and screw your mother-in-law. That is a weird thing to request an apology for. You\u2019re never allowed to be upset at my daughter in my presence. So basically your wife can go full tilt upside your head with a baseball bat but you can\u2019t get mad if her mom\u2019s in the room?! M\u2019yeah no. You have to be impressed though. Your mother-in-law has some serious audacity skills. LOL!"]}
