She\u2019s white, I\u2019m multiracial. She\u2019s also a ditzy, rich girl who is constantly trying to demonstrate how progressive/open minded etc she is. For example on my bday she gifted me a nude painting of myself to \u201ccelebrate\u201d my heritage but that\u2019s another story. \n\nRecently we went to a mutual friend\u2019s game night and I met a (white) guy. We were in the kitchen when my roommate walked in, put her arm around me and demanded to know what was going on. At first I laughed it off and the guy jokingly said that he\u2019s *stealing* me from her. \n\nShe took this VERY seriously and told him that I deserve better than a \u201cprivileged white guy\u201d. I said sorry to him and she said that I shouldn\u2019t be sorry at all. She continued to quiz him on his \u201cintentions\u201d with me and if he ever took steps to \u201cunlearn his bigotry\u201d. This is NOT the first time she pulled a stunt like this (coming in between me and a guy under the guise of \u201cprotecting\u201d me). So I finally told her \u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP\u201d.\n\nLong story short, she cried. A lot. She said that she was only trying to protect me and that I\u2019m so mean. She said that she has never been so hurt in her entire life. \nI told her that she\u2019s literally protecting me from imaginary harm and that I\u2019m sick of her intervening every time.\n\nMy friend group is split but since SHE is the one who cried I look like the offender. I was told I\u2019m an asshole because it\u2019s well known she has a \u201csoft spot\u201d for me. Others said it was about time I did something about her behavior.

I think she has some major feelings for you. \n\n>We were in the kitchen when my roommate walked in, put her arm around me and demanded to know what was going on.\n\nShe was 'protecting' what she sees as her  girlfriend.\n\n>Others said it was about time I did something about her behavior.\n\nI think they are right.   You need to have a talk & ask her if she is gay.

You are are a grown woman who does not need protection from a white saviour.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nI mean, good for her that she's sensitive to privilege issues and all, but she's trying to basically be The Great White Savior coming to protect the poor POC from oppression.  She needs to stop that.", "NTA. This roommate is claiming woke while judging some guy she never met based on his skin color? She has mental issues, find a new roommate.", "Is she in love with you?", "NTA. Honey, let me teach you about the world of performative progressivism. Cause this biatch? Is it.\n\n- \u201cwoke\u201d things they do are still just loaded with stereotypes or horrible misconceptions or understandings of your culture (or insert minority group).\n\n- they\u2019re clueless and irony inept. \u201cPrivileged white guy\u201d\u2026 **every accusation is a confession**\n\n- they forget that the number 1 necessity of progressivism and \u201cwokeism\u201d (fucking hate this word) is to shut the fuck up and listen to the minority at hand\n\n- and form so much of their identity around being a good person or being \u201cwoke\u201d [without actually trying because they never do] that anything that challenges it is shattering. \n\nWouldn\u2019t be surprised if she is your closest friend or you are hers, or you\u2019re her diversity token friend, or the mere fact you\u2019re her roommate she\u2019s turned to a sign that she\u2019s super progressive, but ultimately you\u2019re now a part of that idea.\n\n(That \u201cprotection of minorities\u201d is also often either a white saviour complex, or a fetishising or infantilising of the culture which is just white supremacy through an UWU lens)\n\nShe has a \u201csoft spot\u201d for you because her view of herself as a good person is predicated on your silence and approval, and so when you call her out on her BS she can\u2019t handle it.\n\nIt sucks, but it\u2019s not your problem.

Tell her to shut the fuck up, again. Then say it a 3rd time if you need to. Maybe then, she will actually shut the fuck up.", "NTA, your roommate is acting like a white savior, we don't need more of that. That is in itself a form of racism.", "NTA. Her behaviour seems indicative of her having feelings for you. Regardless of that, she is belittling you by making it seem like you NEED her help to save you from the evil man who was talking to you.\n\nYou needed to talk to her about her behaviour, but in the situation you were in, it's understandable why you snapped.", "NTA You need to rip that band-aid off. She's not gonna get it otherwise. The \"privileged white person\" in the kitchen was not the guy, it was her. If she wants to be a true ally, she needs to be told in unambiguous language that her speech and actions are not supportive. Her attempts to \"protect\" you are in reality an embodiment of the \"white savior\" stereotype. You don't need saving, you want a friendship where you are equals and support each other in the face of any and all hardships. Any \"friend\" who is saying you're the AH because she has a \"soft spot\" for you is falling for the same racist claptrap. Take the racial element out and they're still wrong because they're asking you to defer to her because she pities you. You do your thing.", "She wants you.", "NTA\n\nThis friend's \"soft spot\" for you seems beyond platonic, FYI. I think maybe something a little more is going on here.", "NTA - right up until she made your frustration about HER I was willing to go with no asshole, because she might legitimately think she's being an ally, but the reality is that a white woman resorting to tears when a woman of color tells her she is being disrespectful to the WOC's agency is pretty classic white knight bullshit... So yeah, super NTA.", "NTA. \n\nShe's being exhausting.\n\nI understand that we live in a \"woke\" society for the most part these days, but everyone tries to hard too prove how inclusive they are. Just treat people like people instead of treating POC like they need saving from something or someone. \n\nIt sounds like you need to set some boundaries with your roommate. She might have good intentions, but she needs to understand when to back off.", "It's really hard when someone \"means well.\" It's even harder when someone keeps trying to take a part of your identity,  perpetually misinterpret it, and/or defend it without your okay. However, people not in this situation will never understand. All they understand is you made a \"nice\" person cry. \n\nYou are not a bully. Oddly, she may be. She is trying to force you to live in her perspective of your perceived obstacles, which is lacking.", "Take a picture of her gift and say the following: \"(so and so) I will not sleep with you.

Tell her to look up white women weaponizing tears if she\u2019s so insistent she\u2019s an \u2018ally\u2019", "NTA, she doesn't respect you or look out for your best interest, like a friend should. She sounds like one of those Moms that never made it and now force their daughters to live the life they never had, except with skin color and that you are the same age.", "NTA , but you guys maybe need an open talk and please don't let her talk the way she talks on internet , she sounds so much influenced and sensitive . \nAlso about her white privileged guy comment , she looks like she doesn't appreciate her own race and culture , maybe include that in your discussion .", "NTA, sounds like she may be in love with you. Does she date men or women?", "Nta shes in love with u", "NTA - this sounds like she is extremely possessive of you, almost to the point of her feeling she has ownership of you. How can she not see the hypocrisy in her own actions?", "NTA but you could\u2019ve addressed these issues way earlier in the relationship. You should have. She sounds like she has a crush on you.", "I might leave the word \"woke\" out of it because that word has been trampled into meaninglessness the last couple years. \n\nThat said, NTA. It sounds like your roommate has lived a very sheltered life, and is projecting her own privilege onto others. It's obviously not your job to educate her... but it's your right to call out her behavior when it affects you like this.\n\nThat shell of privilege she's hiding in isn't gonna come away without some tears, I'm sure. Speaking from experience.", "Wow this is a tough one.\n\nI want to give you the benefit of the doubt that you\u2019ve previously tried to patiently and compassionately explain to her before this incident how her wokeness can be condescending and/or controlling. If you had done that, I would say NTA for your reaction to this incident, because she\u2019s showing herself as stubborn (and ditzy as you say).\n\nBut if you hadn\u2019t done that, then you skipped an important step before you\u2019re justified in blowing up at her. If she never received the feedback about how her words and actions are perceived, than the poor girl is well-meaning, but just blissfully ignorant and lacking in life experience.", "YTA this don\u2019t even sound remotely believable", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
