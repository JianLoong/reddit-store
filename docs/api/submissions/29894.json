He was going out with a friend and he asked me if I wanted to come. I didn\u2019t want to be the only girl in the group, so I asked if I could take my friend. I took my friend and then we went for dinner, so it was 4 of us in total.\n\nAt some point, the guys said some of their friends were joining. All of their friends were girls, so there was a total of 6 girls that joined our table at a later time. \n\nOne of the girls, asked me if I was paid to be there. I played it dumb and I asked what does she mean by that. And she said you know if the guy was paying me to hang out and sleep with him. I responded yes, just because I wanted to find out if the other girls were paid and who he associates with.\n\nThe girl said they just been friends for many years and nothing more, but I kind of assumed the girls were paid, otherwise why would she have asked me this as a first question.\n\nAlso the friend of the girl who asked me this was looking at me the whole night and I think she might have asked her to ask me this, as she kinda liked the guy I was with and she even went home with him.\n\nThe guy messaged me the day after that it was second time he tried getting with me, and I responded to try harder, and then he replied easier to just pay. \n\nI told him that whatever I told to the girl, it was to test the waters and see who he associates with. I also told him that the girl asked me if I was a paid girl and that I would have never initiated this type of conversation even if they were, as I wouldn\u2019t have cared. \n\nAITA for his friends implying that I was one? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: The girls knew him for years so he must have a habit they know about. It was just a guy that I was dating and trying to find out more about him from his friends. I replied I was one because people feel more comfortable when you tell them you're in the same potential situation as them and wanted to know if they were paid. There were other things I observed that I didn\u2019t like so this was more like cherry on top and I decided I didn\u2019t have anything to lose anymore by trying to find more about him in this way.I dropped the guy as this was just the getting to know each other stage and he didn't make the cut. I think the way I reacted was a smart way of not getting played by him as he was only looking to sleep with me. \n\nHe also offered to pay, and called me a headache when I said I wasn\u2019t going to do it. I just think he was looking to sleep with me, and realised I wasn\u2019t about to be played by him.\n", "created_utc": 1698571248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17iz6ic/aita_for_telling_the_guy_i_was_dating_that_his/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think instead it offers evidence on the character of the people you were interacting with and their relationship dynamic. \n\nYou answered a ridiculous question in a ridiculous manner that exposed the goal of someone who was just trying to sleep with you. Since you say he was just trying to sleep with you I assume that meant you were there under the pretense of seeking out a serious relationship and not something casual. Under that light his friend question looks even worse. \n\nI would say NTA. Although in the future I recommend not playing along with the nonsense.

He's an asshole for ignoring you.\n\nI am also a bit puzzled that you stayed for so long. If your date is ignoring you the whole night, there's no reason to even be there.", "Umm no?
