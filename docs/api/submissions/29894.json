He was going out with a friend and he asked me if I wanted to come. I didn\u2019t want to be the only girl in the group, so I asked if I could take my friend. I took my friend and then we went for dinner, so it was 4 of us in total.\n\nAt some point, the guys said some of their friends were joining. All of their friends were girls, so there was a total of 6 girls that joined our table at a later time. \n\nOne of the girls, asked me if I was paid to be there. I played it dumb and I asked what did she mean by that. And she explained that she meant asking if the guy was paying me to hang out and sleep with him. I responded yes, just because I assumed the other girls must be paid to ask this type of question and I wanted to find out who he associates with.\n\nThe girl said they just been friends for many years and nothing more, but I kind of assumed the girls were paid, otherwise why would she had asked me this as a first question.\n\nAlso the friend of the girl who asked me this was looking at me the whole night and I think she might had asked her to ask me this, as she kinda liked the guy I was with and she even went home with him.\n\nThe guy messaged me the day after that it was second time he tried getting with me, and I responded to try harder, and then he replied easier to just pay. \n\nI told him that whatever I told to the girl, it was to test the waters and see who he associates with. I also told him that the girl asked me if I was a paid girl and that I would have never initiated this type of conversation even if they were, as I wouldn\u2019t have cared. \n\nAITA for his friends implying that I was one? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: The girls been knowing him for years so he must have a habit they know about. It was just a guy that I was dating and trying to find out more about him from his friends. I replied I was one because people feel more comfortable when you tell them you're in the same potential situation as them and wanted to know if they were paid. There were other things I observed that I didn\u2019t like so this was more like cherry on top and I decided I didn\u2019t have anything to lose anymore by trying to find more about him in this way.I dropped the guy as this was just the getting to know each other stage and he didn't make the cut. I think the way I reacted was a smart way of not getting played by him as he was only looking to sleep with me. \n\nHe also offered to pay, and called me a headache when I said I wasn\u2019t going to do it. I just think he was looking to sleep with me, and realised I wasn\u2019t about to be played by him.\n\n\nAnother edit: I apologise for the mistakes with tenses, English is not my first language.

Who the hell asks a woman out to dinner and then not only has a bunch of his women friends show up, but GOES HOME WITH ONE OF THEM?\n\nAnd again, how on earth is OP the AH in any of this?", "But was this friend paid or not paid? Or is it now a trend to offer non-escort girls money when you already tried two (!!) times to get with them? \ud83d\ude05", "In that case you should read again probably", "No friend of yours would be going around asking the girl you are with if they are an escort in a serious manner unless you have a habit of paying for escorts. Unless you have shitty friends.", "The question \u201care you a paid date\u201d comes with the implication that \u201cyour date regularly pays for dates\u201d", "He literally offered to pay her when he contacted her after the date.  She said try harder and he said it's simpler to just pay.", "Money can be exchanged for goods and services.", "The fact that when she turned him down he replied with \"it's easier to just pay\"....?", "did we read the same post", "NTA mission accomplished.", "She\u2019s the one who agreed that she was an escort. And he was joking obviously, she\u2019s an asshole", "Yes, but that's not really a funny joke and can be rather insulting", "I think OP has a really hard time writing in various tenses. I don\u2019t think he offered to pay her previously, he made a snarky comment about paying her the following day after he heard what she said to his friends.", "NGL, I love the idea that somebody just wanted to fit in so much they claimed to be a prostitute.  \u201cAre you a sex worker?  Ummm\u2026 yeah!!! Totally!! Sex work is the best!!! Right girls??\u201d", "I think he just has shitty friends. She was probably more conventionally attractive than the other women or more dressed up or something and they were being catty.", "I'd assume they were shitty and thought I was out of his league to the point he could only be with me if he paid me.", "Not a good friend, for sure. But someone trying to sabotage a relationship to favor their actual close friend? Yeah that can happen.", "Maybe OP is much more attractive than the guy and they thought he was just out of her league and made a teasing joke to OP about it\u2026 Maybe your friends are different but this scenario does not scream that dude pays for escorts all the time-_- it\u2019s weird to me you took the escort comment so literally.", "But then what does she gain by saying yes? Anything she learned was from the question, not her answer", "They would if the date looked like and acted like an escort.", "Or that the friend is being an asshole and trying to scare you off because her buddy has a crush on the date?\n\nGiven the frankness of the question, which do you think is more likely?", "So what did saying \u201cyes\u201d teach her about the date? The claim was that she played along and learned something.", "What a giant load of crap. The guy has no control over what this girl asked his date, it could imply many thinfs, maybe it could imply she was dressed like a call girl.", "Yeah. No matter how out of someone's league a date seemed, it wouldn't occur to me she was an escort unless the guy was the type to hire an escort/I knew he had previously hired escorts.", "That was a dig at OP since she admitted to a friend of his that she was an escort.", "I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve ever been in a relationship if you can tell that\u2019s sarcasm", "The notion of sex for pay only came up because she introduced it to the relationship. It was a dig at her when he was turn down for what the other girl say.", "That was a dig at OP since she admitted to a friend of his that she was an escort.", "I read that as a snarky way of dumping her, not an actual intention.", "So you're saying that if you were on a date and no money had been discussed, but your date agreed to *an extremely rude and uncalled for question* by your friends, you would instantly believe that you were actually paying an escort?\n\nMaybe my assumption about working neurons went too far ...", "Then why do you care that he was only wanting sex and liked sex workers? If you don't have any interest why are you so pressed about it", "But he didn\u2019t invite these girls the friend did\u2026 \n\nKeep spinning the story to try to make yourself look good. You just look like an absolute head case tbh", "If I was on a date with someone and they decided to tell my friends that I'm paying them to be there, I'd probably be not so happy with that person to the point of potentially ignoring them. OP I don't even know what game you are playing here but it really isn't going well", "Yeah, I agree there seems to be a language breakdown.", "Lots of women who put men in the friend zone are keeping them as spares she may not have liked op being with the guy.", "That seems like kind of weird joke to make to someone you\u2019ve just met? I wouldn\u2019t make the assumption that someone would just laugh something like that off. She barely knows the guy, and literally just met these women. That\u2019s just\u2026not the most pleasant icebreaker", "It\u2019s still pretty fucking insulting", "I mean that's an even worse take. His friends think he is so unattractive or appealing to women that money/favors must be involved for someone like OP to be around him damn friends like that idk... its more weird that a complete stranger would ask if you were a sex worker in the initial convo after meeting", "My buddy brought a girl who was dressed up for clubbing and one other guy referred to her as a \u201cprofessional\u201d after the fact. He didn\u2019t say anything to her though because he\u2019s not a lunatic and she never would have said she was one", "Well she asked the girl to elaborate on her accusation and she went all in by saying being paid to hangout and sleep together. If it was a playful joke they would\u2019ve just said that she means she\u2019s too hot to be with him.", "Well clearly that isn't the case since she replied saying he wanted to pay for sex.", "He literally offered to pay her for sex then insulted her when she said no. Kind of implies he pays for sex.", "why would it be appropriate to tease/make jokes like that towards a stranger", "Read to the end of OP\u2019s post. Maybe it was an edit after the fact?", "[deleted]", "She was trying to gauge if the reason they were asking was because he regularly paid for escorts, or if they were being paid by the other dudes to be there. Those are the only two reasons someone would ask that question.", "She's just trying to twist things to make her look good. But in turn, it's turning into a shit show for her", "I think she might have meant she realized on the night (of the date) before saying this (this being the escort thing), not that she knew she wasn\u2019t interested the night before the date. Not that it makes her behavior any better lol but think that part of her comment might have been unclear", "Nah I\u2019m with the other guy, this is some /r/justneckbeardthings incel bullshit. Some people suck and wish their hot friends to pursue them even if they\u2019re not interested in a relationship, but gendering this mentality is the root of all the alpha male bullshit.", "Lmao no one does that. That's a reddit thing.", "Very weird \u2026 \nnormal people do not ask someone they just met if they\u2019re a prostitute, what kind of weird passive aggressive stuff is that.  She dodged a bullet with this guy.", "He was being sarcastic, if I read it right. That was him taking a jab at OP for pretending to be a sex worker.", "The sarcasm flew right past you at hyper speed that you couldn't see it.", "You're shit at reading the writing of a middle schooler. He was saying it tongue in cheek.", "On one hand, don\u2019t tell people you are a paid escort and then she would not have to deal with the consequences of that declaration, but on the other hand, maybe this is just normal conversation women have to deal with everyday to protect them selves from people getting to know them too quickly.  I once worked with a woman who told me she had a five year old son, months later she invited me and my son to her nine year old daughter\u2019s birthday party.  She had no son.", "But notice that the guy never did with op. He was asking her out on dates.", "Isn't this completely moronic though? Wouldn't the logical thing be to say \"No, of course not. Why would you ask that? This is our first date, is that something he normally does? Are you paid to be here? That's an incredibly off color thing to ask someone.\" \n\nBut somehow playing 4D social chess is being applauded here on /r/detective", "I can think of a better way to gauge that.\n\n\"No, I'm not. Why would you think that? Does he pay for escorts?\"", "She\u2019s an absolute psychopath. It makes me fear for my children that people like this actually exist.", "Women definitely befriend guys they want to be with but \"only when the time is right\" aka they get all they want from their current relationship.", "The nuance is lost to so many Redditors my friend..", "I get that, but like, how could you possibly as your friend's date the first time you are metting them if they are an escort. either a) you are  tactless af so what kind of valid reply is deserved b) you are trying to create drama in the first place or c) you are used to your friend being with escorts..", "I don't think so, because when she refused he said she was a headache.", "Was he being sarcastic when he asked her if he could pay for sex before her friend ask if she was an escort or??", "I don\u2019t think we should applaud it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal, and I certainly don\u2019t think it was 4D social chess. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude to lie to someone who\u2019s asking you a rude question.", "It\u2019s not always easy to say the logical thing, particularly if you\u2019re around new people!"]}
