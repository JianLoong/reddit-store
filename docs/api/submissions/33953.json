She contributes a small percentage of her income (less than 20%) to help with rent/utilities/household expenses and the rest is hers to save/spend. She doesn't have a car and doesn't pay for any other expenses (insurance, etc) as those are all covered.\n\nShe's been dating her girlfriend Sophie for almost two years now and they're serious about each other. They're long-ish distance (about an hour away from each other) and only see each other once a month or so. Sophie lives with her family still as well, only she doesn't pay for household expenses and isn't responsible for any chores. Recently they seem to be getting really hype on talking/fantasizing about getting married and picking out engagement rings &tc. \n\nLast night Leah was telling me all these plans. \"Sophie is going to get me a sapphire engagement ring when she proposes\" \"I think I'm going to wear (x)\" \n\nAnd I was like \"It all sounds really nice hon, but I hope you're keeping your priorities in line. If you're grown enough to put a ring on your finger, you're grown enough to move out and support yourself.\"\n\nLeah wasn't happy to hear that and said they can move in together when they get married, and being engaged wouldn't really make any difference so why should she have to move out right away if they get engaged.\n\n& I told her that personally, I don't believe in marrying someone you've never lived with. I think it's terrifically short-sighted, especially because Sophie is 21 and her mom still does everything for her. But also because neither of them truly understand the responsibilities and pressures of supporting themselves. Especially in the current economy. \n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with having these fantasies and dreams with a partner, and I emphasized that. My intention was to caution her against getting swept away in it/prioritizing it above other milestones that would help her survive independently.\n\nShe told her aunt (my sister) about the conversation later and her aunt called me and chewed me out for spitting on a harmless romantic fantasy. I said if it's really that harmless, she shouldn't be bothered by the idea of having to wait.

It's very common for parents to help pay for weddings. Plus potentially a house downpayment, car payments, living expenses? If you're gonna have to pay for this wedding, she better as hell be sure this is the right person to spend the rest of her life with. And that involves living together for a short time.

Also, there's such a VAST difference between being in a relationship with someone you see like once a week, and one you see every day, even if you don't yet live together! Leah really is just a kid with no life experience and is insulted because you pointed that out.", "YTA, who can afford to move out at 20 these days?

How can two people commit to life together if they can't even \"mock up\" what that life would look like? at the very least, financials should be in order to make sure the start of their marriage is as stable as possible; they owe themselves that for their happy future.

I'm thinking that Sophie has no idea about how the real world works and probably doesn't know how to budget and Leah mat find herself doing all the housework because Sophie seems to think there is a fairy that does all of that.  \n\nYou're not wrong but this isn't the hill I would die on.  Leah is going to have to make her own mistakes and deal with the consequences.\n\nIt's probable that all Leah heard was that you want her to move out rather than the stuff behind it.  You might want to tell her that you're fine with her living at home but just to be aware that she does a lot more at home than Sophie does so may be in for a rude shock when they move in together and there is going to be an adjustment period and it may be a good idea to do that before they get married.\n\nYou may want to have a contingency plan when she does marry and move out and that might be that you aren't the safety net when they can't afford their rent because someone bought something that wasn't needed.  They are going to have to prioritise.  Leah has some idea.  Sophie may or may not have any idea.\n\nHaving said all that, Sophie may actually be really good at this stuff.  Just because she doesn't pay anything to live at home may be because her parents want her to save a deposit for a house instead and she's a very good budgeter.  She may also know exactly how to do chores but no one is enforcing it at her place... that you know of.   The girls have a long distance relationship... is it Leah that's telling you that Sophie does no chores because it's possible she's angling for you to tell her she also doesn't have to do any (will really be a rude shock when she moves out) or that Sophie doesn't have to do them when Leah is visiting so they can do more together.", "NTA I tell everyone they should live with someone before getting married.

It doesn't sound like you were dismissing Leah and Sophie's relationship, but rather giving your daughter some pretty sound advice.\n\nGetting married before living together and only seeing each other a couple of times a month is a TERRIBLE idea. If you only see your SO on date nights, you're both (hopefully) making an effort to make it a pleasant experience by being thoughtful and making special gestures - putting more thought into your appearance, bringing small gifts, planning a nice outing, whatever floats your boat.\n\nThe real test comes when you both come home from work exhausted, and some days you can't be bothered to wear anything but sweatpants, and you discover that you have incompatible sex drives, and your SO drinks milk straight out of the carton.\n\nMaybe your daughter and Sophie will get married, maybe not. And I totally understand being all moony and swept-up in the romance, but it's always a good idea to keep a little realism in the back of your mind.

She contributes a small percentage of her income (less than 20%) to help with rent/utilities/household expenses and the rest is hers to save/spend. She doesn't have a car and doesn't pay for any other expenses (insurance, etc) as those are all covered.\n\nShe's been dating her girlfriend Sophie for almost two years now and they're serious about each other. They're long-ish distance (about an hour away from each other) and only see each other once a month or so. Sophie lives with her family still as well, only she doesn't pay for household expenses and isn't responsible for any chores. Recently they seem to be getting really hype on talking/fantasizing about getting married and picking out engagement rings &tc. \n\nLast night Leah was telling me all these plans. \"Sophie is going to get me a sapphire engagement ring when she proposes\" \"I think I'm going to wear (x)\" \n\nAnd I was like \"It all sounds really nice hon, but I hope you're keeping your priorities in line. If you're grown enough to put a ring on your finger, you're grown enough to move out and support yourself.\"\n\nLeah wasn't happy to hear that and said they can move in together when they get married, and being engaged wouldn't really make any difference so why should she have to move out right away if they get engaged.\n\n& I told her that personally, I don't believe in marrying someone you've never lived with. I think it's terrifically short-sighted, especially because Sophie is 21 and her mom still does everything for her. But also because neither of them truly understand the responsibilities and pressures of supporting themselves. Especially in the current economy. \n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with having these fantasies and dreams with a partner, and I emphasized that. My intention was to caution her against getting swept away in it/prioritizing it above other milestones that would help her survive independently.\n\nShe told her aunt (my sister) about the conversation later and her aunt called me and chewed me out for spitting on a harmless romantic fantasy. I said if it's really that harmless, she shouldn't be bothered by the idea of having to wait. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also don't think they make enough together to support a marriage. I'm happy to support Leah while she works on building independence and getting to the point of being able to move out. I don't think she needs to be engaged right now.", "K but like, is that all you read?", "I mean it's literally in the title of the post so I'm with you on the vibes.", "Her life and relationship aren't a fantasy at all. But right now the wedding plans are - there's nothing solid holding them up. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think it's normal to have dreams together as a couple, and I support that aspect and told her that. \n\nBut you can't fulfill a dream if you don't give it a foundation. The foundation is finding a way to stand on her own feet as an adult so that she can be prepared to support that relationship transition.\n\nIf she gets engaged she's not getting thrown to the street, but I'll expect her to make a plan to move out.", "She would need to make a plan to move out if she got engaged.", "Not that I'll expect her to leave immediately/throw her out on the street, but she'll need to have plans in place to move out. If she wants to be engaged, she needs to be ready to support the relationship she's committing to.", "OP could mean an hour by car, which would make for quite a walk for most people.", "My boyfriend lives an hour away. It would be an 8 hour walk, mostly along the motorway, to meet halfway. Neither practical, legal or safe.", "Women who date other women tend to move really fast--there are a lot of potential factors that go into why this happens, but the fact is it's often a cultural norm in woman-loving-woman spaces to skip some of the early stages in a relationship (for better or for worse). And it's also pretty common for WLW to get into long distance relationships, which means that sometimes your choices are \"see each other every few months\" or \"move in together.\" So a lot of people choose move in together when presented with those options. I agree with OP that his kid probably ought to move out before getting engaged but I'm not really surprised that she wants to get engaged at this point.", "A stereotype of lesbian women is that they move into relationships really quickly.", "They also have the highest divorce rates. Gay men have the lowest.", "Yeah because they had farms to run, and because unmarried children were expected to provide labor to their households until they started cranking out kids themselves. Also, child labor used to be legal, gay people went to jail, and women weren\u2019t allowed to have bank accounts or access their medical records without a male relative\u2019s consent. \n\n\u201cIt used to be that way\u201d is an absurd rationalization - particularly from someone who\u2019s projecting a homophobia narrative.\n\nThe mom didn\u2019t say she\u2019d kick her daughter out for going against her wishes, either. She just made her opinion known that independent living should occur if someone is making an adult decision like engagement. But her daughter acted like a 12yo throwing a tantrum because mom won\u2019t buy her a pony. \n\nNo WAY this child is marriage material for anyone yet, and the gf sounds even more unprepared. I wish them the best if they do go that route but they\u2019d be idiots to not live together for a while *before* spending (at least) $2000 (likely of their parents\u2019 money) on a ring that will lose 75% of its value the second it leaves the store.", "But daughter isn\u2019t an adult, she lives under the umbrella of OP\u2019s financial protection which is one of the reasons OP said what they did", "Hey op ignore this idiot they clearly have a short sighted view of the world and it shows", "When she can operate as an adult she'll have all the privileges of one.

Is it not \"engaged to be married\"? Getting engaged means planning to get married, *planning* being the operative word here, which is exactly what OP is telling them, that they need to be *properly* planning their future together which means learning to support themselves.\n\nOP, NTA. This sounds like a very normal exchange with a young daughter and it *seems*, by your telling, that you handled it well.", "Ew", "For some reason the daughter seems like the type that would say \"oh I can't think about the logistics of moving out right now, we have to worry about planning and paying for the wedding and honeymoon.\" Then it's gonna be \"well I can't move out right now cause we just spent a lot of our savings on the wedding\". Op isn't explicitly saying the they can't get engaged. She's saying it's more important to make sure you can support yourself as an adult before planning big life decisions that generally come with big bills. \n\nEven if the daughter were to cut contact, I feel like she'd open that contact back up once she realizes how hard it is to pay bills yourself, especially while living with someone that has never done that before. You can cut someone off for any reason, doesn't automatically make you right for it. It's not smart to rush into big life decisions before you've even genuinely experienced all the stressful parts about living life as an adult. \n\nI mean seriously, how many women have married men that lived with their parents their whole life and never learned to be responsible for themselves as an adult and the woman only realized afterwards that the person she married couldn't be a responsible adult. It's just a big mess and a lot of money wasted for something that can be worked out before hand.", "That's not what you said in your OP, though. You said you thought they should live together before getting married.", "Disagree.", "I love this approach. It's so supportive and loving.", "You are right that they should live together before getting married. Overall, they are being fairly immature. \n\nYou are well intentioned, and your sister had no right to mouth off to you like she did. \n\nYou do need to tell your daughter that she is being unrealistic, but may have been shalt in the delivery. \n\nI'm going with NTA. As a mother/stepmother of many kids and someone who moved out of my parents' house at 16 years old... I get where you're coming from.", "ok but how does Leah's getting engaged affect you and her status in her household?", "What does that mean \"make enough to support a marriage\"? I marriage is 2 people agreeing to a lifelong bond. It doesn't inherently necessitate any money at all, except for the cost of the license. Also, no one needs to be engaged ever. This just sounds more like you want her to grow up, move out, and be independent. I don't know why you're tying this to getting engaged or married.", "That's the part you were saying you were missing.", "Haha very fair and good point lol", ">If she gets engaged she's not getting thrown to the street, but I'll expect her to make a plan to move out.\n\nWhy, though? I can understand not wanting her partner to move in, but if nothing else changed except they called each other fiance instead of girlfriend, would you still insist that she moves out?", "I agree her life and relationship are very real, I'm saying the wording in the OP came across to me like you feel that way, mostly because of the direct wording you used. I'm glad you feel that way though, and agree with your first 2 paragraphs\n\nThe 3rd still comes across like an ultimatum to me. I'm reading \"if she gets engaged, she MUST move out, and soon\"\n\nIt sounds like you're saying you feel different than it's coming across to me, and I'm only hoping that the feedback from people on here gives perspective on how your daughter might be hearing it too", "Maybe instead of phrasing it the way you did you could start asking about her plans for living on their own when they are married. Do they plan on joint finances, will they split bills 50/50 or a percentage based on income? Offer to help her with a budget for where they\u2019d plan to live etc. Ask how they decide who cleans the bathroom. Stuff just to get her to gently start thinking about what living on her own entails.", "This was you:\n\n>I didn't say \"If she gives you a ring I'll kick you out\". \n\nBut now you're saying, you're basically going to do exactly that, but maybe you'll be kind enough to give her an eviction notice. \n\nShe's just going to hide her engagement from you.

Why would you expect her to move out right away?", "Thank you for kindly explaining \ud83d\ude42", "I have a lesbian friend who dated this woman 20 yrs ago and it ended horribly with cheating etc.  They got back together 6 months ago, moved in after a week and a 1/2, broke up a couple months later for a week (the gf moved out and everything), got back together again (gf moved back in) and were engaged less than 2 weeks later.

They\u2019re literally planning on a 2K engagement ring?\n\nGetting married is inexpensive, but having a wedding and BEING married is very expensive indeed. \n\nOh, and the approximate *retainer* for a good divorce lawyer in the US? About 5K per party. Who do you think will end up paying that?", "Housing, utilities, bills, transportation, cell phones, insurance, etc. The same things you need to be prepared to support yourself with as an adult.\n\nThis is absolutely about independence. For me, independence comes before engagement. If you can't even take care of yourself, how can you meaningfully agree to marry someone?", "I suppose they could keep a longish-distance relationship where they both live with their own parents while married, but that honestly seems strange to me. \n\nThere is no reason why OP should care for her daughter's spouse if that is not something they want to do. I guess Leah could also move in with Sophie and her parents, but I doubt her parents would want to take on financial responsibility for another person either. \n\nIt's one thing to take care of your own child, but it is completely different for your child to expect you to take care of someone else.", "Ok but where's the \"or else?\"\n\nShe, an adult, needs to live on her own before considering marriage.\n\nYou need to flush the toilet after you're finished.\nYou need to check the water heater.\nYou need to brush your teeth.\n\nWould should be a better word?

It says he wants her to live with her fiance before marriage.", "due to circumstances outside of our control, we had to ask our parents for assistance a few times when we were first married.

Weddings don't have to be expensive, and being married doesn't have to either.", "All those things are entirely related to supporting one's self as an adult and have nothing intrinsically related to being married.

If she's saving as much as she can and you can afford to put even a bit of that money aside if a high interest savings account for when she's just about ready to buy a home for herself, it could really set her up for the future as well.", "I see, that does make it more reasonable, but still to say that your own daughter doesn't deserve the privilege of being treated like an adult until she moves out is toxic. She is an adult. She deserves to be treated like one. You should be encouraging her to think about the future, plan on getting an apartment, and really think about rushing in to marriage, but the way that you brought it up and the way that you're talking about it here comes off as disrespectful and condescending. You dangling the roof over her head won't help.", "The gf is the one that is the full time student not his daughter.
