{"id": 23143, "submission_id": "159r2ck", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL what her wedding first dance song was about?", "selftext": "My brother (29M we\u2019ll call him Tim) is marrying a really sweet girl (27F we\u2019ll call Carrie) the whole family loves her and is excited for the wedding. She\u2019s made a point of including me (25f) in the planning and it\u2019s all been going smooth until a few weeks ago. We\u2019re finalizing the design of the invites and Carries added a line for song requests to give the DJ on the RSVP. I mention that it\u2019s a super cute idea and she says she hopes no one requests her first dance song. I ask what her first dance song is and she makes me swear to keep it a secret. I promise and she tells me it\u2019s \u2018O Children\u2019 by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. \nMy mouth falls open and she asks me what\u2019s wrong. I ask her if she\u2019s ever really listened to the lyrics and the narrative of the song. She says it\u2019s just the Harry Potter song and changes the subject. I don\u2019t push it but can\u2019t get it out of my head. \nMy family is Jewish and the decedents of survivors. (Carrie is not religious but has happily come with us to synagogue and celebrated holidays with us.) This song is about the Holocaust, having verses about taking the train to the Gulag, being hosed down and inspected, etc. \nI see my brother the next day and ask him about it, hoping it\u2019s some artistic statement or some thing. He says he\u2019s never really listened to the actual lyrics and only knows it from watching Harry Potter with Carrie and since he\u2019s not super concerned about a first dance (he\u2019s never been a sentimental man) he left it up to her to pick the song. I\u2019m uncomfortable but willing to walk away from it at that point, it\u2019s not my wedding after all. And I think I\u2019m done with it until a few days later when I get a frantic call from Carrie.\nAfter I asked about it my brother looked up the actual lyrics as well as a few lyric breakdowns and told her she\u2019d need to pick another song. That the wedding will be done by our rabbi and our survivor grandparents will be there. That he wouldn\u2019t dance to a song that says gulag in it. Especially as Carrie wants the first dance to be recorded and he doesn\u2019t want to watch their wedding videos with their future kids and have to explain the song. He suggested finding some other song that is significant to them, like something from their road-trip playlist, but said he would not dance to O Children. \nCarrie was livid screaming that \u2018Tim never cared about the song before and that I had poisoned him against her, that the whole family would think she was a white supremacist.\u2019 (I asked around my relatives and no one has any clue why she\u2019d thing they\u2019d think that about her.) And that \u2018I had not only ruined her wedding day but the whole first dance surprise.\u2019 I guess Tim also spoke to our mom and she spoke to our grandparents about it and now most of the family knows. \nCarries is now refusing to talk to me and arguing with Tim about me being invited to the wedding at all while Tim is still steadfast that he won\u2019t have the song played or uninvite me. AITA?\n\nEdit: my brother knew the song choice before I spoke to him, he\u2019d just never really listened to/looked up the lyrics.\n\nEdit 2: thank you to the commenter who corrected me!

Then, knowing how your family would feel about it, asked your brother if he knew. He didn\u2019t. You still didn\u2019t say anything.

I\u2019ve never heard it and looked up the lyrics. Why on earth would someone want that for their first dance?!? A wedding is hopeful and full of promise. That song seems to be about sadness, lament and death.", "NTA. She\u2019s upset for now but later on she\u2019ll be happy she didn\u2019t have her first dance be to a song with Holocaust references in it. Sometimes being a good friend is telling someone what they  need to hear instead of what they want to hear.", "NTA! Carrie wtf. Honestly the biggest red flag here is that Carrie would be willing to overlook this song\u2019s meaning instead of respecting her future husband and his family. \n\nYou did not overstep by informing your brother of this. Good luck with the wedding", "NTA, there are different interpretations of that song, but if your brother says \"no\" and your family will be hurt, then hell no, put your foot down. Also, I've never seen the Deathly Hallows so I had no idea that was a Harry Potter song.", "NTA.  You saved the bride from embarrassing herself and potentially offending the husband's family.

Hopefully this behavior is out-of-character for Carrie.", "Definitely NTA, you probably saved everyone from a great embarrassment, even if she doesn't realize it.

Sounds like SIL is very stressed and taking it out on you.", "NTA wtf is wrong with your SIL, I don't care if it was my favorite song ever, if I found out it was a holocaust song there is no way it would be played at my wedding and my family isn't Jewish(but someone I know is/could be) but she's marrying a Jewish man and into a Jewish family, I would be weeping and begging forgiveness for my ignorance, to think she's more upset about a song than the impact of this on her partners family is disgusting and if I were your brother I'd be rethinking about the relationship and if he really wants to marry this person.", "NTA - you saved them from a HORRIBLE wedding disaster, that sound would not have gone over well. It shouldn\u2019t be playing at the wedding at all. She should be thanking you, unless of course she is actually a white supremacist who is going to put a movie above people who actually survived the holocaust.", "NTA.

However looping everyone else in was unnecessary.\n\nESH", "ESH. You did a good thing by letting Carrie know what the song is about and how it would be perceived. Probably would have saved her from a lot of embarrassment. Carrie\u2019s reaction was nuts. Then you undid the good you had done by talking to everyone about it.

The fact that they are mentioned in the first verse should be a pretty big clue that this song is not about Holocaust.\n\nThat's ignoring a shit ton of  nuance.\n\nGulags are Soviet prison camps. They operated before, during and after WW2. Soviet Jews often ended up in those camps as political enemies or as part of the population that was being rounded up at the time (e.g. the Great Purge). Jews were persecuted in the Soviet Union because of their religion and also because anti-semitism.\n\nDuring WW2 Stalin collaborated with Nazi command to remove Jews from political posts within the Kremlin. In addition when Poland was annexed just about all Polish people in Soviet territory ended up in a Gulag - that included Polish Jews. \n\nAlso after WW2 the Soviet Union took control of 10 Nazi concentration camps and then used them as part of the gulag system.\n\nGulags also share a ton of characteristics with Nazi Concentration camps and when you consider the Holocausts physical spread and timeline (starting in East Europe/Soviet territory then appearing in West Europe/Germany) you might note that simply defining the holocaust as mostly happening in Germany isn't quite accurate.", "Thanks for this - I was so confused as to why a gulag featured in a song about the Holocaust!", "Take my upvote!", "I just read the lyrics and it's really heart breaking.

Where'd you get that from?", "Yes, historically the gulags are similar to the concentration camps, but the gulag was an instrument of repression that was primarily directed against its own population as political opponents, while the concentration camps arose from the racist ideology of the Nazis (although the concentration camps were also used against homosexuals and political opponents, but the basic idea was to keep the German nation \"pure\" in the racist sense). This is a different ideological and political context. \n\nBoth concentration camps and gullies are low points in our human history that should never be forgotten and should urge us to never let something like that happen again and that's why I think the song is not wedding material but in the overall context, I think OP is wrong here.

It's not until about 1935 that Himmler calls for an expanded remit and includes all political dissidents like: LGQBT+ peoples, Jews, criminals, socialists and Freemasons. Edit to add: all these people were considered subhuman. The Nazis weren't racists in the traditional sense - they considered political, religious, physical and lifestyle choices in their hierarchy.\n\nThen by about 1938 it expands out to homeless peoples, peoples with intellectual disabilities and the unemployed. There are more political arrests during this time - Jehovahs witnesses and Germans who tried to emigrate.\n\nIt's not really until Kristallnight that we have a mass influx of Jews into concentration camps, and most of those arrested at that point were released when they promised to emigrate.\n\nOnce the war starts concentration camps are also used to house (mostly Soviet) POWs and Eastern Europeans from annexed areas. \n\nIn fact it's true that most Jews who were murdered as part of the Holocaust never ended up in a concentration camp. The death squads (firing squads) kill the largest number of Jews. The extermination camps that were set up specifically during the Holocaust were also not part of the concentration camp system.\n\nThe Holocaust itself occurs from 1941-1945, and the camps were in operation well before that.\n\nThe camps share a ton in common with gulags and the reasons Jews ended up in them initially weren't to do with the Holocaust itself.\n\nThat being said there is a ton of nuance, especially when you consider that concentration camps became gulags and both were used by different regime to murder/oppress Jewish people through the same points in history.", "Ohhh thank you for sharing!

No one from my country (which lost 1/3 of the population in the war) has ever called and will call the concentration camp Gulag. We know very well the difference between the Gulag and the concentration camp, in the end, about 100 thousand of my fellow citizens died in the Gulags, while the war and concentration camps killed about 3 million.

Sometimes a song is just a fun song choice that people like & it\u2019s not that deep.\n\nI don\u2019t know *exactly* where the line is, but\u2026 songs about Holocaust are DEFINITELY over that however.", "My husband DJ\u2019d a wedding and they wanted that Bruno mars song that says \u201clooking for something stupid to do, guess I\u2019ll marry you\u201d or something like that.", "But with this family in this case that particular song may be offensive and that\u2019s what the entire post is about. And as gulag means forced labor camp and Russian Jews were also targeted and taken and killed the word Gulag can be interpreted for their survivors and descendants as the same as a Nazi death camp. \n\nWe all have different perceptions and the OP and groom feel the same about this particular song.", "Maybe. If the concern is the grandparents getting upset, I don't undertand why they (or OP's mom) were told, though. This could have been handled between OP, her brother, and his fiance. Then she's less embarassed. Now, everyone is going to be thinking about this issue during the first dance. In my mind, it's put way more attention on it now.", "That one bugged me when it first came out, like he's such an asshole. Just break up with your girlfriend, you clearly want your ex back!", "Don't listen to 'I don't like Mondays' then!", "LOL, you're meant to put an /s at the end of such posts.", "Thank you for explaining. I don't know why my previous question was downvoted. It was a genuine question. As I said I've never read or seen any HP.", "Not just a transphobe but also a known antisemite.", "Not a love song but my husband pointed out to me that Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind has way more crystal meth and sex in it than most people think.", "Plus, and it's not *as* horrific, every one of her fat characters is evil or a coward. \n\nThere's more as well, Cho and Chang are both last names from different languages, and Seamus?

I'm sure there's more than this also", "Definition of gulag from Oxford dictionary: \u201da system of labour camps maintained in the Soviet Union from 1930 to 1955 in which many people died.\n\na camp in the Gulag system, or any political labour camp.\u201d\n\nThere is really no other interpretation of this song. You are *not* critically thinking about this.", "Dalbello - \"Gotta Get Close to You\" - super psycho stalker chick song.\n\n80s Canadian singer.", "Let's toss N'Sync's \"It's Gonna be Me\" onto this stalker trashpile. I recently heard it on the radio and had an entirely different reaction to it that I did when I was 15\n\nETA: It sounds like OP prevented her SIL from enacting this scene from Party Down: https://youtu.be/-t271itvSGQ", "\u201dEvery Little Thing She Does is Magic\u201d is almost as stalkerish as \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d.\n\n\u201cI resolve to call her up a thousand times a day\u201d. Really?", "How? Gen X started in 1965, and it came out in 1983.", "Going against the masses here.  YTA. the song is not about the Holocaust or anything like that.  If it were, it wouldn't have been heard in a Harry Potter movie which is meant for all viewers. I've never really watched an HP movie, but since children are the main characters, the song would need to be sensitive to that.  A gulag is a labor camp, and the children in HP were most likely being sent to one. \nOP made this about their culture and background when it didn't need to be.  It is NOT about the Holocaust.", "NTA for suggesting she review the lyrics but you are a little bit off on the meaning.\n\nTo Paraphrase Amanda London who desiphers song lyrics for a living:\n\n\u201cO Children\u201d is one of those pieces whereas a matured adult, in this case the vocalist, is lamenting the state of the world he, his agemates, and we can even say the older generation(s) left it for those who are now coming up. It is not abundantly clear what it is exactly that frightens him about the future, nor do the specifics of the situation appear to be the point per se. But he does appear to be speaking, theoretically, to the prospect of some type of governmental repression, considering that Nick uses terms such as \u201cGestapo\u201d and \u201cgulag\u201d to get his ideas across. However, in the grand scheme of the song, those references can arguably be taken more as symbolic than literal constructs. What Nick Cave is speaking to is contemporary society, if you will, knowingly leaving the world in a more messed up state than we found it.", "NTA, but I think your SIL just might be. Please do an update as I want to know if your brother moves forward with this wedding.", "NTA but there is something seriously wrong with your SIL. No matter how much she loved the song if she knew what it was about she can not have thought that was appropriate or reasonable!?\n\nThe dismissal of \"it's just the Harry potter song\" but she then didn't ask follow up questions or check screams that she knew and didn't care.", "**NTA** not at all! *You saw a disaster in the making so severe that, in your opinion, (and I agree with you) that it superseded your promise not to tell your brother.* So, yes, you did ruin the surprise but thank goodness that you did! Could imagine how that scene would have played out had she gone forward with the plan to use that song?! *Your brother was wrong, very wrong, to tell anyone and your mom is really, really, really wrong for telling your grandparents.* Once he had calmly explained to her what the lyrics meant, she should have agreed and thanked you for averting the disaster. Then that should have been the end of it but your brother and mother ran their mouths and now Carrie's wedding day memories will be forever tainted by the scandal that was created by their blabbing mouths. I can understand her concern of being thought of a white supremacist or having some members of your family change her opinion about her because she has gone from being a nice girl to \"the girl who wanted to play *that song* for her first dance\". However, that is not on you! If Carrie continues to blame you, take the responsibility for ruining the surprise about the song but quietly and calmly explain to her why you did it - you were trying to prevent a traumatic scene at the wedding as people heard/listened to the song. It almost sounds like she is more upset about losing \"her song\", the surprise, and what people will think about her now that your brother and mother have put it out there on blast rather than having picked the song in the first place. If I were her, after I'd crawled under the bed in embarrassment for choosing such an inappropriate song, I'd come crawling out to clean up the mess I had inadvertently created. I'd make my fiance, and have him make his mother, explain to everyone that they ran their mouths to that she liked the tune but had never really listened to the words/understood what the song is actually about. (BTW, shame on the Harry Potter movie people for even using the song. Why help popularize a song about the holocaust?!) However, just between us, doesn't a 27 year old woman know she should be looking at the lyrics before choosing the song she wants to dance her first dance as husband and wife?! Especially these days when many songs have lyrics that are not suitable for that purpose. \n\nClarification - you say your brother knew the song choice before you spoke to him - does that mean that he knew she had chosen it to be their first dance song? Because, if so, you did not ruin the surprise, someone else did but Carrie is blaming you for it. Or did you mean he was aware of the song but had not payed much attention the lyrics?", "Girl's shooting the messenger, for sure. Idk how OP could've been more tactful. She kept it to the people directly affected and let it go when it seemed like neither the bride or groom had a problem with it.", "Agreed, NTA and as listed here, there are no shortage of bad wedding songs.  \nWas at wedding years ago, the 1st dance was to Meatloaf, Paradise by the Dashboard Lights.", "She had her dream of what it was about-she's thinking 'harry potter magic' and is looking for someone to blame instead of thanking OP -NTA by the way- for saving her from the equivalent of having \"Springtime for hitler\" as her first dance.", "And if this IS the hill she wants to die on, Tim needs to reflect a bit before the wedding.", "Thank you for the explanation because god damn was I never going to remember where in the movies that song was from.", "Either way, I'm not sure how a song whose lyrics reference gulags or prison camps of any kind would belong at a wedding.    \n\n\nUnless it was about love that survived such a camp, but it sounds like this song (having not heard the song, and now not intending to) is not that.", "I just read the lyrics and you are seriously underplaying the Holocaust imagery in it", "Not at all, I\u2019ve never read or seen all the HP movies because I don\u2019t support the author but definitely not a song I\u2019d want played at a wedding at all, let alone for a first dance. \nTo be fair, she may not have known the meaning of the song before, but the fact that she\u2019s doubling down and having this reaction is raising a red flag for me!", "Feels realllly gross to tell Jewish people what can and can\u2019t remind them of the holocaust. You really think it\u2019s a reach from listening to the lyrics? The fact that it\u2019s part of a larger body of work is irrelevant, it\u2019s being played as a standalone piece at a JEWISH WEDDING. Would you really be making this argument in person?", "R.E.M.'s \"The One I Love\" is a breakup song, but it gets heavy rotation around Valentine's day. One part includes the lines \"A simple prop / To occupy my time\".\n\nSo yeah...", "I went to a wedding where they played \u201cBetter Man\u201d by Pearl Jam.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not paying attention to the lyrics (abusive relationship), you really can\u2019t avoid that chorus of \u201cCan\u2019t find a better man.\u201d", "Open up another package of My Bologna ... another song improved by Al Yankovic", "Except Jeremy is explicitly about a kid killing himself in class, and the line is actually \u201cJeremy spoke in class today\u201d, meaning he shot himself in front of his class. It\u2019s also based on a real event, sadly. The Wikipedia article for the song tells the story.

I think OP's objection is absolutely bizarre.", "Or, stay with me for a hot second here, the word \u2018gulag\u2019 is way easier to work into a song than \u2018extermination camp\u2019 lmao.", "That fucking song.  Used to fill me with rage.", "Because she doesn\u2019t really like Nick cave she just likes the Harry Potter song", "Didn\u2019t think anything could really shock me anymore but I stand corrected \ud83e\udd2e", "Omgggg", "Not the kind of a bang a bride dreams about.", "Oh my. I love dark songs with an upbeat rhythm, so I am fond of the original, but I do think Lorde's cover of \"Everybody Wants To Rule the World\" captures the, um, *tone* of the actual subject matter much more accurately.

I love that song but the beat is very fast for amateur ballroom dancing.", "This was like 8 years ago, and they're still a happy normal couple. Also still dumb as the day is long.", "It still does for me because iHeart radio keeps trying to play it.

He saw her with her new boyfriend on the Underground. They looked at each other.
