{"id": 23143, "submission_id": "159r2ck", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL what her wedding first dance song was about?", "selftext": "My brother (29M we\u2019ll call him Tim) is marrying a really sweet girl (27F we\u2019ll call Carrie) the whole family loves her and is excited for the wedding. She\u2019s made a point of including me (25f) in the planning and it\u2019s all been going smooth until a few weeks ago. We\u2019re finalizing the design of the invites and Carries added a line for song requests to give the DJ on the RSVP. I mention that it\u2019s a super cute idea and she says she hopes no one requests her first dance song. I ask what her first dance song is and she makes me swear to keep it a secret. I promise and she tells me it\u2019s \u2018O Children\u2019 by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. \nMy mouth falls open and she asks me what\u2019s wrong. I ask her if she\u2019s ever really listened to the lyrics and the narrative of the song. She says it\u2019s just the Harry Potter song and changes the subject. I don\u2019t push it but can\u2019t get it out of my head. \nMy family is Jewish and the decedents of survivors. (Carrie is not religious but has happily come with us to synagogue and celebrated holidays with us.) This song is about the Holocaust, having verses about taking the train to the Gulag, being hosed down and inspected, etc. \nI see my brother the next day and ask him about it, hoping it\u2019s some artistic statement or some thing. He says he\u2019s never really listened to the actual lyrics and only knows it from watching Harry Potter with Carrie and since he\u2019s not super concerned about a first dance (he\u2019s never been a sentimental man) he left it up to her to pick the song. I\u2019m uncomfortable but willing to walk away from it at that point, it\u2019s not my wedding after all. And I think I\u2019m done with it until a few days later when I get a frantic call from Carrie.\nAfter I asked about it my brother looked up the actual lyrics as well as a few lyric breakdowns and told her she\u2019d need to pick another song. That the wedding will be done by our rabbi and our survivor grandparents will be there. That he wouldn\u2019t dance to a song that says gulag in it. Especially as Carrie wants the first dance to be recorded and he doesn\u2019t want to watch their wedding videos with their future kids and have to explain the song. He suggested finding some other song that is significant to them, like something from their road-trip playlist, but said he would not dance to O Children. \nCarrie was livid screaming that \u2018Tim never cared about the song before and that I had poisoned him against her, that the whole family would think she was a white supremacist.\u2019 (I asked around my relatives and no one has any clue why she\u2019d thing they\u2019d think that about her.) And that \u2018I had not only ruined her wedding day but the whole first dance surprise.\u2019 I guess Tim also spoke to our mom and she spoke to our grandparents about it and now most of the family knows. \nCarries is now refusing to talk to me and arguing with Tim about me being invited to the wedding at all while Tim is still steadfast that he won\u2019t have the song played or uninvite me. AITA?\n\nEdit: my brother knew the song choice before I spoke to him, he\u2019d just never really listened to/looked up the lyrics.\n\nEdit 2: thank you to the commenter who corrected me! The lyric is \u2018key to the gulag\u2019 not \u2018train to the gulag.\u2019", "created_utc": 1690333300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159r2ck/aita_for_telling_my_sil_what_her_wedding_first/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People often get caught up in the music and don\u2019t listen to the words carefully. You may have prevented her from making a major faux pax that wouldn\u2019t easily be forgotten. She is being extremely immature and a real AH for her over the top reaction.", "NTA - someone needs to sit Carrie down and explain the giant ass favor you just did her and your brother. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s more embarrassed than anything right now but could you imagine if people got up and started walking out during their first dance? I understand the moment she pictured is not going to come to pass, but she\u2019s joining a family that has generational trauma that cannot be ignored. If she wants to make this her hill to die on, so be it, but I would seriously be rethinking my partner if they could not see besides themselves regarding something like this. You did good OP. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you any different.", "NTA. You\u2019re a hero for saving her from future embarrassment and regret. Hopefully one day she\u2019ll fully understand why that song was not appropriate for your family.", "NTA. you didn\u2019t tell her what it was about/an interpretation of what it\u2019s about. \n\nYou asked her if she knew. Then, knowing how your family would feel about it, asked your brother if he knew. He didn\u2019t. You still didn\u2019t say anything. Your brother then looked it up, didn\u2019t like it, and wants to change it. So Carrie is upset her soon to be husband has an opinion. \n\nCarrie needs to get a grip. And a new song. I\u2019ve never heard it and looked up the lyrics. Why on earth would someone want that for their first dance?!? A wedding is hopeful and full of promise. That song seems to be about sadness, lament and death.", "NTA. She\u2019s upset for now but later on she\u2019ll be happy she didn\u2019t have her first dance be to a song with Holocaust references in it. Sometimes being a good friend is telling someone what they  need to hear instead of what they want to hear.", "NTA! Carrie wtf. Honestly the biggest red flag here is that Carrie would be willing to overlook this song\u2019s meaning instead of respecting her future husband and his family. \n\nYou did not overstep by informing your brother of this. Good luck with the wedding", "NTA, there are different interpretations of that song, but if your brother says \"no\" and your family will be hurt, then hell no, put your foot down. Also, I've never seen the Deathly Hallows so I had no idea that was a Harry Potter song.", "NTA.  You saved the bride from embarrassing herself and potentially offending the husband's family.  Her response is tragically selfish.  No good deed goes unpunished.", "\u2026I\u2019ve never heard of this song so I googled it and my jaw dropped. \nI would be glad you let me know in her position, that\u2019s completely inappropriate. \nNTA at all", "NTA.  Future SIL is a fool.  You saved her from a huge embarrassment that will be recorded and remembered, and she's angry at you?  News flash: \"O Children\" makes sense for HP bc Voldemort was a supporter of blood purity, remember that tiny detail and the battle that was fought?  Genocide is on-theme for HP -- does Carrie want that theme for her wedding?\n\nTim has the right idea.  Hopefully this behavior is out-of-character for Carrie.", "Definitely NTA, you probably saved everyone from a great embarrassment, even if she doesn't realize it. Besides, why is she even angry at you? You haven't told anyone but your brother, who has looked up the meaning of the lyrics and made this decision by himself", "NTA - Her response is whack-a-doodle. She takes no time to reflect;  only deflects hate while screaming. This is an extreme reaction. I was waiting for her to thank you after she read the lyrics in context of your family Hx. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Knowledge is power. You mentioned interpretation: How do you misinterpret Gulag...the cleaners have come..etc. There is nothing right about playing this song during your brother's wedding. It's also OK if you don't go. Ceremony's are public (typically) and you can be present then.", "NTA,\nCarrie needs to chill. I assumed she just didn\u2019t know but this over the top reaction actually has me wondering tbh.", ">'...the whole family would think she was a white supremacist.\u2019 \n\nWell, let's hope that isn't a sign of things to come.\n\nNTA and well done.", "NTA. You were trying to save her a big embarrassment.", "I've never seen HP, and also don't know the song... I just googled the lyrics.\n\nWTF how is this a song in a children's movie?????\n\nNTA", "Her battle over this song is the dumbest fight I\u2019ve heard from a bride in a long time.  You did nothing wrong.  Why she won\u2019t just pick another frigging song is not your problem.", "NTA. Sounds like SIL is very stressed and taking it out on you.", "NTA wtf is wrong with your SIL, I don't care if it was my favorite song ever, if I found out it was a holocaust song there is no way it would be played at my wedding and my family isn't Jewish(but someone I know is/could be) but she's marrying a Jewish man and into a Jewish family, I would be weeping and begging forgiveness for my ignorance, to think she's more upset about a song than the impact of this on her partners family is disgusting and if I were your brother I'd be rethinking about the relationship and if he really wants to marry this person.", "NTA - you saved them from a HORRIBLE wedding disaster, that sound would not have gone over well. It shouldn\u2019t be playing at the wedding at all. She should be thanking you, unless of course she is actually a white supremacist who is going to put a movie above people who actually survived the holocaust.", "NTA.  That's not a very romantic song.", "op=NTA\n\nThere was a mother who wanted her Mother-Son Dance to be Hearts--I want to make love to you.  \n\nknew a Bride who chose father-daughter dance:  You look wonderful tonight(leaving out the last verse)", "NTA. Let her pick Every Breath You Take and ruin that sing for her too.", "I just went on YouTube to watch it. Nearly every comment is about Harry Potter and no one seems to recognize the... Very obvious Holocaust references.", "I want to say you\u2019re not TA here, as I think it was very important that you got them to pause and listen before using that song.\n\nHowever, what also sticks out to me is: \n\n>I asked around my relatives and no one has any clue why she\u2019d [think they thought of her as a white supremacist]\n\nand\n\n>Tim also spoke to our mom and she spoke to our grandparents about it\n\nI mean, that\u2019s pretty rough that she confided to you what she thought was an innocent surprise and instead now has your entire family thinking she either is either highly ignorant or potentially evil.\n\nI think you were absolutely right to tell your brother. However looping everyone else in was unnecessary.\n\nESH", "ESH. You did a good thing by letting Carrie know what the song is about and how it would be perceived. Probably would have saved her from a lot of embarrassment. Carrie\u2019s reaction was nuts. Then you undid the good you had done by talking to everyone about it. Now she can\u2019t trust you and you have humiliated her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP's only compelling evidence is \"having verses about taking the train to the Gulag,\" and that's NO WHERE in the song.  At the beginning there's keys to the Gulag which are given away before the kids run away and at the end there's a train taking happy kids to the kingdom. It's a creepy song and weird for the wedding, but it's not about the Holocaust.OP, YTA. \n\nEdit: no, gulags are Russian, hosing them down is another way of saying give them a bath, hoses were a form of torture the Nazis did not use, inspection happens everyday at private schools and sports leagues.  And their happy to be taken away by train.  Were the kids who were victims of the Holocaust happy to be packed into trains like cattle?  I never read that in any book.  OP is a major AH and so is everyone defending her.  She spread and internet rumor and took her future SIL's wedding song from her.", "The later HP movies really aren\u2019t children\u2019s movies.  The series was written to kind of grow up with its readers (that is, it gets progressively scarier and higher stakes as the series goes on), and the movies if anything heighten that.  The movie this was in was PG13, and with good reason.", "I only spoke to my brother about it as he already knew the song choice. He\u2019s the one who spoke to our mom and it spread from there.", "There is a line about the keys to the gulag. \n\nAbout hosing them down and cleansing them. \n\nAbout being taken away by train. \n\nAnd you DONT think it\u2019s an allegory for the holocaust?", "You think:\n\n* lovely little gun\n* mopping up the butcher's floor\n* They've hosed you down, you're good as new/And they're lining up to inspect you\n* In this process of elimination\n\nYou think these lines are about happy little children taking a train????????  \nReading comprehension, not your friend.(nor allegory)", "But what is the relationship of a song about the gulags with a romance between 2 characters? Why was that song chosen...\n\nI don't expect an answer, just wondering.", "It wasn't a romance between Harry and Hermione.\n\nThey were dancing to a song about Gulags as they were on the run from people who wanted to kill/imprison them.", "Not a HP fan myself, but I always saw the movies with my mom because she loved the books. The song is played when the two main characters are essentially on the run, as they search for hidden objects to destroy the antagonist. All the protagonists are being chased down, tortured, killed etc. at this point in the story. \n\nAnyway, the two characters are emotionally drained and listening to the radio and the song comes on and they start slowly dancing to the song. Not sure if they did a remix of the song, or just did a very good selection from the song, but it is an effective scene, and does play out beautifully in the context of the lyrics they played and the tone of the film. \n\nBut to be honest, I never heard this song played any other time in my life, and never heard the whole thing until I looked it up a few minutes ago to read the lyrics in full."]}
