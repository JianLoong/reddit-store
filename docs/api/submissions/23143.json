{"id": 23143, "submission_id": "159r2ck", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL what her wedding first dance song was about?", "selftext": "My brother (29M we\u2019ll call him Tim) is marrying a really sweet girl (27F we\u2019ll call Carrie) the whole family loves her and is excited for the wedding. She\u2019s made a point of including me (25f) in the planning and it\u2019s all been going smooth until a few weeks ago. We\u2019re finalizing the design of the invites and Carries added a line for song requests to give the DJ on the RSVP. I mention that it\u2019s a super cute idea and she says she hopes no one requests her first dance song. I ask what her first dance song is and she makes me swear to keep it a secret. I promise and she tells me it\u2019s \u2018O Children\u2019 by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. \nMy mouth falls open and she asks me what\u2019s wrong. I ask her if she\u2019s ever really listened to the lyrics and the narrative of the song. She says it\u2019s just the Harry Potter song and changes the subject. I don\u2019t push it but can\u2019t get it out of my head. \nMy family is Jewish and the decedents of survivors. (Carrie is not religious but has happily come with us to synagogue and celebrated holidays with us.) This song is about the Holocaust, having verses about taking the train to the Gulag, being hosed down and inspected, etc. \nI see my brother the next day and ask him about it, hoping it\u2019s some artistic statement or some thing. He says he\u2019s never really listened to the actual lyrics and only knows it from watching Harry Potter with Carrie and since he\u2019s not super concerned about a first dance (he\u2019s never been a sentimental man) he left it up to her to pick the song. I\u2019m uncomfortable but willing to walk away from it at that point, it\u2019s not my wedding after all. And I think I\u2019m done with it until a few days later when I get a frantic call from Carrie.\nAfter I asked about it my brother looked up the actual lyrics as well as a few lyric breakdowns and told her she\u2019d need to pick another song. That the wedding will be done by our rabbi and our survivor grandparents will be there. That he wouldn\u2019t dance to a song that says gulag in it. Especially as Carrie wants the first dance to be recorded and he doesn\u2019t want to watch their wedding videos with their future kids and have to explain the song. He suggested finding some other song that is significant to them, like something from their road-trip playlist, but said he would not dance to O Children. \nCarrie was livid screaming that \u2018Tim never cared about the song before and that I had poisoned him against her, that the whole family would think she was a white supremacist.\u2019 (I asked around my relatives and no one has any clue why she\u2019d thing they\u2019d think that about her.) And that \u2018I had not only ruined her wedding day but the whole first dance surprise.\u2019 I guess Tim also spoke to our mom and she spoke to our grandparents about it and now most of the family knows. \nCarries is now refusing to talk to me and arguing with Tim about me being invited to the wedding at all while Tim is still steadfast that he won\u2019t have the song played or uninvite me. AITA?\n\nEdit: my brother knew the song choice before I spoke to him, he\u2019d just never really listened to/looked up the lyrics.\n\nEdit 2: thank you to the commenter who corrected me!

Then, knowing how your family would feel about it, asked your brother if he knew. He didn\u2019t. You still didn\u2019t say anything.

I\u2019ve never heard it and looked up the lyrics. Why on earth would someone want that for their first dance?!? A wedding is hopeful and full of promise. That song seems to be about sadness, lament and death.", "NTA. She\u2019s upset for now but later on she\u2019ll be happy she didn\u2019t have her first dance be to a song with Holocaust references in it. Sometimes being a good friend is telling someone what they  need to hear instead of what they want to hear.", "NTA! Carrie wtf. Honestly the biggest red flag here is that Carrie would be willing to overlook this song\u2019s meaning instead of respecting her future husband and his family. \n\nYou did not overstep by informing your brother of this. Good luck with the wedding", "NTA, there are different interpretations of that song, but if your brother says \"no\" and your family will be hurt, then hell no, put your foot down. Also, I've never seen the Deathly Hallows so I had no idea that was a Harry Potter song.", "NTA.  You saved the bride from embarrassing herself and potentially offending the husband's family.

Sounds like SIL is very stressed and taking it out on you.", "NTA wtf is wrong with your SIL, I don't care if it was my favorite song ever, if I found out it was a holocaust song there is no way it would be played at my wedding and my family isn't Jewish(but someone I know is/could be) but she's marrying a Jewish man and into a Jewish family, I would be weeping and begging forgiveness for my ignorance, to think she's more upset about a song than the impact of this on her partners family is disgusting and if I were your brother I'd be rethinking about the relationship and if he really wants to marry this person.", "NTA - you saved them from a HORRIBLE wedding disaster, that sound would not have gone over well. It shouldn\u2019t be playing at the wedding at all.

However looping everyone else in was unnecessary.\n\nESH", "ESH. You did a good thing by letting Carrie know what the song is about and how it would be perceived. Probably would have saved her from a lot of embarrassment. Carrie\u2019s reaction was nuts. Then you undid the good you had done by talking to everyone about it.

There was a song that came out a few years ago, I actually can't remember the name, but it sounds like slow romantic love song. When you actually listen to the words though it's basically about someone's wife being told that the cancer that she had fought has come back and there's nothing tha they can do. I destroyed a few people's love of it when they mentioned how they loved it and I suggested they listen to the actual lyrics.", "I went to a wedding where \"Every breath you take\" By sting was their first dance. Me and half the guests looked around, had a little chuckle to ourselves and left it at that. Years had passed and we were talking about the dance and the bride laughed so damn hard as it was that moment she went \"gee it kinda soumd like a stalker song!\" I laughed and said it was pretty funny but half the wedding thought it was a super sweet song lol\nThat being said thats a big difference in song/lyrics in my firends wedding vs OPs SIL.  OP was right to mention what the lyrics were and how it could offend or even traumatise some of the guests. Its a song, another one can be picked in its place, easily.", "Pumped up kicks", "Friends of mine had the winner takes it all from abba as a wedding song. Some ppl just don't listen to lyrics. (It's about a divorce)", "I would imagine she wants it because she's a Harry Potter fan. Harry and Hermione dance to it at one point, but they're not romantically linked and it's not a romantic moment and it sounds as sad as it is so I don't get it, even as a fellow Harry Potter fan.", "Ok. I don't know about no Potter or this particular song. Is there truly a song about the Holocaust in these silly kid's book movies?\n\nedit: [Wow. What a bunch of edgelords the creatives involved with this franchise are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKWydA69o9E&t=80s)", "I had to give it a listen to as I couldn't remember it being in Harry Potter, and lyrics aside, it just doesn't seem like a first dance song. Doesn't seem very much like a wedding song at all, tbh", "There are no Holocaust references other than in OP\u2019s head. Have you read the lyrics?", "People wanted a wedding song where part of the chorus was \u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019ll never be with you?\u201d", "Yeah I just listened to it, it's pretty obvious that it is a metaphor- it's not like, pro-genocide.  It's still a bummer of a song but OP is way off base as to the reasons why it's bad.", "There was concentration camps in russia occupied territory, hence why they probably say they're \"Gulags\".\n\nHere's a list of the camps in russia https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/full-listing-of-concentration-camps#russ", "So perfect for a wedding, then.\n/s", "What does the Soviet Gulag have to do with being Jewish?", "Cave isn\u2019t confused. The people thinking it\u2019s about the Holocaust are confused.", "Cave wasn't confused, he's not an idiot. The song isn't about Holocaust at all. OP is confused and it's very weird to talk so much about being from a family of survivors while not knowing what a Gulag is...", "It's not about the holocaust. Gulags were Soviet prison camps.", "It\u2019s not even about the holocaust, Nick Cave uses the word Gulag (Soviet, not Germany) in a metaphorical sense. OP is over analyzing and lacks historical knowledge.", "Right? It\u2019s weird how overreactive she\u2019s being. I get maybe not knowing the lyrics if she only knows it from Harry Potter, but after OP said something I would have looked up the lyrics, and changed song choice. \n\nHer reaction is making side eye her motivation for picking it in the first place", "My parent\u2019s wedding song was The Best of My Love by The Eagles \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35 (it\u2019s a breakup song)", "My uncle had \u2018It Started With A Kiss\u2019 by Hot Chocolate as his wedding song.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad song about a guy who encounters his long adored childhood sweetheart as an adult, only to realise that she doesn\u2019t even remember him.", "Tom Jones' 'Delilah' is a popular one...", "Or Bruno Mars 'Grenade'. My idiot sister played it at her wedding", "My Sharona....", "The best I've witnessed personally was \"Gravity\" by Sarah Bareilles. They thought it was a song about being super duper in love, when it's clearly about codependency. At least it wasnt the first dance.", "NTA. you didn\u2019t tell her what it was about/an interpretation of what it\u2019s about.", "It still baffles me how many people dont know that song is about a school shooting.", "Also: 'decedents' means dead people. OP was looking for the word 'descendants.'", "I don't know the song, but while the gulags were not extermination camps where millions were gassed, they were nonetheless pretty horrific for the estimated 18-25 million people who suffered in them (estimates of how many died in them vary, but at least 1.5 million is a pretty safe bet) \u2013 and anti-semitism was absolutely a factor in why many people were banished to them. So it's really not surprising that descendants of Holocaust survivors would not be terribly pleased to listen to a song that talks about the gulag.", "Thank you!!! I\u2019m starting to think they don\u2019t teach history in school anymore.", "Was it Wrecked by Imagine Dragons? I really messed with my co-worker's head when I told him it's about the singer's sister-in-law passing away from cancer.", "In an old interview I saw many years ago, Sting said he was always bemused that people play that sone at their wedding as it IS about a stalker!", "I do hope that\u2019s true. Hardly something she should ruin a friendship or wedding over, although her embarrassment might override her thoughts right now. \n\nOr, much worse, you ruined such a special song for her by telling her the truth and she genuinely feels resentment. The feels like a red flag.", "I think it\u2019s from the scene where Harry and Hermione dance together in deathly hallows part 1 - so that may be why she associates it with dancing", "No.  Gulag is a Russian work that means prison.  No one in the German Army in WW2 is using Russian words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF you think Nick Cave doesn't know the difference between an extermination camp, a death camp, a concentration camp and the Russian gulag prison system, clearly, you have no idea who Nick Cave is", "Forgive me, I also see lines about housing people down and lining up for extermination or what not and get reminded of a particular kind of imagery.", "Damn - you guys are destroying the classics tonight. I had no idea. And thank you.", "Or \u201cI Honestly Love You\u201d", "Saving all my love for you is explicitly from the point of view of a mistress pining after her married lover, and yet it is still used as a first dance sometimes.", "My husband requested that we dance to \u201cEverybody Wants To Rule The World\u201d by Tears for Fears at our wedding and neglected to mention that the lyrics were about *nuclear warfare.*", "I might just be ignorant, but what\u2019s wrong with the song? It seems like he\u2019s just singing about how much he loves his wife and how pretty she is.

I mean, it's still not really appropriate for the stated purpose, but it clearly isn't about Holocaust, or at least not only about it.", "It's so weird though. That scene is very clearly, \"We're trying to hold onto a glimmer of normalcy during a war that's tearing our families apart. We're enjoying today because tomorrow isn't guaranteed.\" That sort of thing. It's weird anyone would hear it and think it'd be good for a wedding.", "Because it's a song about Soviet genocide and purges while ole no Nose Voldemort is planing a genocide and purging wizards who aren't on his side.", "Listen sunshine don't get your knickers in a twist because you think you know best when your not fully informed. \n\nGulag means \"Glavnoye Upravleniye Ispravitelno-Trudovykh Lagerey\" which translates to \"Chief Administration of Corrective Labour Camps\".\n\nThe Gulag was the government agency in charge of the Soviet network of forced labour camps which were set up by order of Vladimir Lenin, reaching its peak during Joseph Stalin's rule from the 1930s to the early 1950s. The Slang term of gulag meant \"Any prison or detention camp, especially for political prisoners.\" \n\nBut there was also concentration camps in russia during the ww2 but only in areas the Germans had taken from the Russians.

We just focus on the Nazis because they singled out race/religion, Mao added a zero and still didn't think hittler's numbers were high enough...", "Yeah I\u2019m going to need to look up the interpretations for all of these songs later.", "You're Beautiful by James Blunt. Yeah, a song about being sad after stalking your ex and her new fella on the London underground while high is great for a first dance.", "But for the mother son dance?
