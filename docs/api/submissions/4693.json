Good luck on this one", "NTA\u2026nope.  Stop calling off.  Tell your parents that you can no longer call off or you will lose your job and that is not going to happen.  Your brother\u2019s mental health is not your responsibility.  What if something g does happen?  And they did not get him the help he needs?  Are they going to blame you?   Also, babysitting a 16 year old\u2026being there  is one thing, but if he can play video games, he can cook and clean up after himself.   Also, I realize mental issues are different for everyone, but when my daughter is suffering, she cannot do much else, but lay in bed and she is a gamer herself.  I am wondering how much is mental, laziness or is there something going on at school?  Your brother really needs to be evaluated and your parents need to make it happen.  Would they rather have to call off work to get him the help he needs or to plan a burial?", "NTA. Not your responsibility.", "NTA Time to say no and tell her you are not his parent and you will not be there so she needs to get him help that isn't you", "I would present that sum as as a bill to the parents when they pull out the \"but we're family\" line as what their inadequacy costs OP", "Nta.

The only reasons I can see why your mother wants you to call off work and babysit your 16yr old brother is because he's suicidal or is at risk of substance abuse (or something similar along those lines).  If this is your mothers concern, then they need to be the ones stepping up - not an 18yr old brother.  By stepping up, I mean - getting him professional help (sounds like even his school is recommending he get help).\n\nIt is wrong for your parents to be putting this type of responsibility on you.  You are right to not want to call off work any more - you've already done it and it shows you do care about your brother but you can't be considered his long term solution.", "NTA my job is as important as yours, my brother is not my child, either put him in therapy or send him to the grandparents who  am not jeopardising my future because you she don't want to deal with your sons issues", "NTA. you are not his parent", "He's 16. He can look after himself. NTA.", "If OP's parents think that their jobs are more valuable than OP's, ok. They should pay her the same wage she would make if working out of home.

Complete with hazard pay in case he ever got aggressive with op", "NTA\n\nYou aren't the parent. Depending on what are the brother's issues at 16 either he needs to be learning to take care of himself or if he isn't then your parents need to find another way to have him watched."]}
