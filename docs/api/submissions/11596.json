(On 3/4/22) Of course I agreed & would never mind doing my nieces hair, as i\u2019m a hairstylist & i\u2019ve always done my sisters hair, too. \n\nSo after I agreed , my sister sent me a few inspiration pictures & before she started planning further I forewarned her that I wasn\u2019t comfortable rendering a service in which a ton of heat would be used on her daughters type 3C/4Ahair- because it could potentially damage her hair. Also, children tend to run and climb around so it would be a waste of heat.\nHowever, in her usual fashion, she was persistent & didn\u2019t let up. (even after I forewarned her that I wouldn\u2019t be rendering said style & to choose a new one) \n\nFast forward to the day of my nieces party, she brings her into the salon to get her hair styled. When my niece got in my chair she was visibly upset so I asked her what was wrong & she said that she wanted \u201cPrincess Tiana\u201d hair & \u201cNot down hair\u201d (the Farrah Fawcett inspired blowout that my sister told her she would get) I agreed with my niece because it Which was 100% more doable & practical for such fragile hair. My sister intervened & told my niece that she didn\u2019t have a choice because they needed pictures to which I told my sister that my niece DOES have a choice on her birthday. \n\nI also reminded her that I forewarned I wasn\u2019t doing a salon blowout on her daughters hair because of her fragile texture. She got upset, left, & traveled to another hairstylist who rendered the service. I didn\u2019t chase after her as I had 2 more clients to service before I was off for the day & arguing with her would\u2019ve thrown me off my pivot.\n\nNot even 25 minutes after they were out of the salon, the hair was becoming frizzy & ruined because my niece was crying & having a tantrum- since she said she wanted Princess Tiana hair & got a ridiculous Farrah Fawcett blowout.\n\nSo when the birthday party started, the hair looked undone & she causes this scene to the family & friends about how I ruined her plans & wasted her money she spent with the other hairstylist (even after forewarning her weeks in advance) \n\nMy sister is giving me the cold shoulder because she claims I left her to fend for herself after she stormed out of the salon when I refused to compromise the health of my nieces hair so early on.  \n\nShe also claims that I took resources from her for having to find a new hairstylist who takes squeeze in appointments. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel like the A**hole because my family is making it seem like I blatantly disrespected my sisters vision & social media pictures. \n\nI understand the pressure of social media but she embarrassed me at my nieces party & discounted my expertise as a stylist when she made it seem as if I was lying when I said heat is damaging on fragile young hair .\n\nI just hope the stylist didn\u2019t damage my nieces curl pattern because of her over zealous mother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678073553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jn4ss/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_6_year_old_a_niece_a/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel bad for your poor neice though. Sounds like she had a really bad birthday", "NTA. You are not responsible for your sister\u2019s bad decisions. But what is this stuff about \u201cthe pressures of social media\u201d? That\u2019s nonsense. The reality is, social media is an entirely voluntary thing, a source of entertainment and distraction, and that\u2019s all. There are no \u201cpressures\u201d \u2014 the only \u201cpressure\u201d is her own vanity and hunger for attention and ego validation if she posts pictures and gets likes. \n\nShe could simply *not post any pictures at all* of her young child\u2019s birthday party, and that BS about \u201cher vision\u201d is a just self-important garbage. In the grand scheme of things, your sister\u2019s pictures online are completely irrelevant, no one cares about them. And her \u201cvision\u201d is nothing more than a pathetic scheme to get some fleeting sense of validation.\n\nEven people who follow her or upvote her posts will give them a moment\u2019s attention and then forget all about them. THAT is what she considers more important than her own child\u2019s happiness on her birthday. Shame on her, and shame on your family for acting like her stupid social media posts are something that should matter to anyone.", "NTA. Social media pics being so much more important to your sister than what her child actually wanted is pretty messed up though", "NTA. You put your niece\u2019s health and wishes first. You know, what her mother should have done.", "From my perspective, which will be different from someone else's, I will confidently say you are NTA.\n\nYou are two important things in this situation: \n1. You are a professional hairdresser (and it sounds like you know your stuff when it comes to that). \n2. You are a loving relative (uncle/aunt/you pick) to your niece and don't want to mess up her hair. \n\nI think your sister was being a bit selfish by not respecting her daughter's wishes (on her birthday no less), or your professional advice. From my perspective, she's in the wrong.\n\nYour decision to not style your niece's hair in a destructive way only caused hardship to your sister because she would not compromise. \n\nSure, your niece's hair was doomed the moment your sister decided how it was going to be styled, and your decision to not help only delayed the inevitable, but if you had simply made it easier on your sister, YOU would be the one messing up the hair, which would not only have been a disservice to your niece, but also to yourself both personally and professionally.\n\nI hope you can productively resolve this with your sister soon. Stubbornness can be a great annoyance, but also a great strength when pointed in the right direction.", "Wait, I\u2019m confused. \nYour niece wanted hair like Princess Tiana, \n\nYour sister wanted her to get a Farrah Fawcett blowout\n\nYou politely declined because the Farrah Fawcett blowout would damage her hair\n\nYour sister went to another stylist who did what she asked\n\nThe hair got ruined like you said it would because of her texture\n\nNow she\u2019s blaming YOU?\n\nDo I have that right?", "NTA - you seriously have to ask? You did right by your niece and protected her beautiful locks. Children that young do not belong getting a Farrah hairstyle. Does your sister have a thing for Charlie's Angles? She is the one with the agenda and obviously did not care what her daughter wanted for her birthday. She was being a bad mommy!", "NTA. For some women, their children are nothing more than fashion accessories. Poor kiddo. Thanks for standing up for her.", "NTA i feel bad for you your niece it sounds like you sister only cares about what she gets out of pictures and probably can post on social media and not about you niece\u2019s happiness", "NTA. You gave her plenty of time to chose a more appropriate hairstyle and she made the choice not to and didn't even listen to her daughter. I hope your niece has better birthdays in the future.", "NTA. You listened to your niece on her birthday. It's horrible that your sister wants to push some vision that her daughter doesn't share, and that would potentially damage her hair. It's pretty sad, really.", "NTA. You were trying to look out for the safety of your niece. You even expressed your concern and told your sister beforehand to pick another style. \n\nIt's so sad that social media trumps the health, safety, and emotional well-being of our kids. Sister needs to get off her social media high horse.", "NTA.\n\nYour niece wanted to be a princess and you wanted to help her be a princess. You had legitimate reasons for not doing the other style. \n\nI would tell your sister that her social media bull**** is not more important than her daughter and that if she thinks it is, maybe she shouldn't have had kids. Kids have their own opinions eventually and a princess style would still have looked adorable in photos. This kid is probably gonna go NC with her eventually if she keeps this up.", "Obviously NTA.", "Obviously NTA. Your sister was obnoxious. I\u2019m sorry your niece got stuck in the middle.", "NTA at all. If she wants to use your niece for likes, I would post the chat where you communicated with her about the blowout. Maybe that's too petty but she can't blame you for the mess she made.", "NTA Your sister is. Yes she's the child's mother and what she says goes. But that's ridiculous and mean. What's with this Farrah Faucet look? Because this little girl was forced this look her hair came out awful. Her mother should have listened to you especially on her child's birthday", "NTA\n\nYour sister is abusing her child for likes. It's not okay. She is teaching her kid that her consent and opinion doesn't matter if it makes mummy happy.", "NTA It sounds like your sister needs to find a new stylist. Ignore the haters, you did nothing wrong. All the subsequent negative fallout belongs completely to your sister.", "Woof NTA.\n\nYou're literally a hair expert and your sister ignored your very valid concerns, and oh look the kids hair got messed up! Gee who could have predicted that? Oh right. You. The expert.\n\nSorry your niece had to deal with her mom being thirsty on social media.", "NTA.
