Let their parents parent, and if you have anything to add, you bring it up with their parent later, away from the kiddos.\n\nFor another... In my own experience, the only appropriate answer to \"You're not my mom,\" is to acknowledge that that's correct, you're not, and then either apologize for overstepping or explain why you feel justified in doing or saying something parental. CALMLY. like an ADULT. When a kid says that, it's because they feel you've overstepped their boundaries and they are letting you know where those boundaries are. You don't get butthurt about it. ESPECIALLY not when you're SIX MONTHS IN. \ud83d\ude44 Hell, at that point, it isn't even justified getting your feelings hurt over it. You're not even a step-parent. Get a clue.\n\nI can see how the age plays in here as it would be difficult to take someone seriously as a \"parent\" when they're that close in age to you. But tbh, I think she was way out of line regardless of her age (and tbh she sounds pretty immature anyway.)\n\nAlso you don't tell someone else's kid to \"shut up.\" Hell, I have trouble imagining telling my own kid to shut up (maybe in anger in a moment, but I'd certainly feel bad about it.) But definitely not my partner's kid. Wtf.\n\nAnd imo your dad is an AH for standing up for her and not you.\n\nThat's my $.02.", "YTA. You don't need to shut up because she's your mum. You need to shut up because you need to shut up. She was right, you were wrong. If you don't want her comments, maybe don't have a ruckus in front of her.", "Anytime I see a post from a kid who has a stepmother/girlfriend where the age difference between the dad & the SO, & the SO & kid are really close, my reaction is usually NTA. It\u2019s just ick. And it\u2019s usually because the stepmom/gf is showing their ass & trying to demonstrate their adult-/parental hood.", "NTA! I'm very proud of you for standing up to your stepsister I mean your dad's girlfriend lol I hope you don't apologize either", "I once broke up with a guy I\u2019d been dating for a few years because he was trying to parent my kid.  He wasn\u2019t doing anything outrageous, he was just a little bit more strict than me, and my kid is a pretty great person so didn\u2019t really need disciplining.  Things like, kid would ask to go to a friend\u2019s house, he would answer before me that since kid didn\u2019t clean their room they couldn\u2019t go out.  Anyway, wishing him well wherever he is, kid is still great and only has to be parented by those that birthed her.", "Not only is she completely not your mother, sounds like she was only 11 when you were born. You're almost peers. That worries me more than her trying to tell you to shut up. If they do not end up married, your dad is going to get gf's that are increasingly younger, and eventually younger than you. You owe him and her nothing. Stand your ground on this one, especially if Dad sides with her. Get Mom to back you up if you can.", "I (F) shared a room with my brother from the time he was born (I was 5) until he was 13 because my parents couldn't afford enough rooms for the 4 of us.

She's nothing to the OP. She should have kept her mouth shut", "It's a pain but you should be taking stuff into the bathroom to change rather than kicking your brother out of his own bedroom. Same goes for any privacy he might be wanting in the years to come. Not relevant to the question because yes, lexie shouldn't have said anything but changing happens twice a day at least normally so you should have a coping mechanism in place.", "I mean yeah, people need there own space...

She doesn't act like this most of the time, she did in this situation because she was irritated and offended by OP's comments. Think of her as a roommate who is sick of OP's shit.", "yup I agree with you.  especially since shes only been around 6 months. \n\nWhen my mom got with my stepdad, My siblings and I were already adults.  he was completely respectful of us and never pushed any of us or told us what to do like all my moms ex idiots. I admit it took me over a year to even be around him a lot. \n\nIm very lucky he is a great stepdad. always gave great advice to us, respected our boundaries and was even a dad figure to my husband. My husband made us go to there place every weekend lol My stepdad took us camping and  shooting... fishing.. my husband never got to do any of that with his own dad. \n\nNow my mom and stepdad have been split for a few years now unfortunately, but i still see him as my stepdad.", "your probably right.

Not cool or legal,.", "ESH.\n\nIf your dad and Lexie actually told you the words 'shut up' that's not exactly appropriate, but it's a different story if you're just describing it that way because you're mad that adults intervened when you and your sibling were bickering. \n\nThe dynamics of a blended family are tough, so I recommend seeking out some counseling to help you cope with it. \n\nAt the end of the day though it doesn't matter how old Lexie is: she's an adult and you do have to give her a baseline level of respect just like you would give an aunt, a camp counselor, or a teacher. It sounds a lot like she was just following suit with whatever your dad was doing to handle the situation, and while I realize it's tempting to see her as an outsider it doesn't justify being shitty towards her at all.  \n\nI would strongly recommend trying to take the 'path of least resistance' here and try your best to give Lexie the benefit of the doubt as an adult who simply set a boundary with you. She probably felt like she was supporting your dad. A single interaction like this can be rattling and frustrating for you - especially at your age - but it doesn't automatically mean she's trying to take over as a parental figure. \n\nIt may be tempting to retaliate, but I guarantee you that is going to create tension that is wholly unnecessary. There's just no point. You don't have to inject that into this situation, as difficult as it may be to realize it. Remember that she doesn't have to be seen as a 'threat' - regardless of her age. She isn't a mom replacement: she's just a new addition to your dad's life, and she might make him really happy. There's no way to know this early on. \n\nWith all that said, it's your dad's decision to bring her into the household. If you have issues with her or how things are going in the household in general you need to confront your dad about it, because Lexie is essentially what you might call a 'neutral third party' here. She's just a spectator to how your household is run by your dad at this point. If \\*he\\* isn't respecting your boundaries that's something you need to discuss with both him and your mother.", "NTA, and Lexie needs to realise that apart from being in a new relationship the age gap between OP and her is only slightly more than between her and OPs dad- so she\u2019s never going to have a maternal role with her boyfriend\u2019s children and if she expects/wants the relationship to be lengthy, she\u2019ll need to work out how to exist in their lives without any authority. Being friendly would be a good starting point and she\u2019s tripped at the first hurdle", "NTA. You have a mother and the gf is not it. Your dad should be the only one in his house that is disciplining you and your brother.  That being said, you should still be respectful to the gf\u2026IF she is respectful to you and your brother.

And respect is not a one way street\u2026 you have to give it to get it.   \n\n\nYou should talk to your mom about this situation, and if there have been other situations where the gf has tried to parent you guys.   \n\n\nThe gf needs to stay in her lane.", "Everything u said here is reasonable. \n\nWhy does bro wanna see sis changing huh?\nWhy is Lexi now telling you what to do, she's practically ur older sister, but I'm not judging the age gap it's just a little to big .", "NTA.

I don't agree with the dad letting a brand new girlfriend take on a parenting role, but not all verbal reprimands are parenting. This sounds like an isolated incident where OP was shocked that they actually got any kind of negative feedback from dad's girlfriend, but regardless the 15 year old should generally be deferring to the adults.", "Exactly; if you\u2019re causing fights with your sibling, expect to get checked by someone for it. Does not mean that person wants to parent you.", "This is the comment I've been waiting for. There are a lot of things going on here that aren't ideal, but being disrespectful to an adult just because they aren't your parent sets a bad precedent.", "No, the brother was being a little kid.   Even this teenage girl knew that.   She admittedly said it just to be rude.  Next time OP can change in the bathroom,  like normal people who share a room do.  And if she was arguing like that,  she kinda deserved to be told to shut up but whomever was having to listen to it", "he asks me to leave so he can change, I do so without any issue", "This is terrible advice. You're just encouraging additional dysfunctional and disrespectful behavior, and it's not constructive.", "Not only that, but she\u2019s closer in age to OP than she is to OP\u2019s dad!", "This was my issue.

In fact, I don't think yelling \"shut up\" at anyone is okay. But hey, what do I know, I've only been a step-parent and I'm raising my child on my own because my ex did stuff like that to me.

Plenty of teenagers don't want to be seen naked by their siblings.\n\nI shared a room with both brothers and my sister when visiting my dad for a term when we were young.
