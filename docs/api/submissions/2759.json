For one, six months in is WAY too soon to start stepping into any form of discipline or chastising (especially when you're only seeing them every other weekend.) Unless you've been specifically asked to babysit (and you're too old to need a sitter anyway), you stay out of that stuff. Let their parents parent, and if you have anything to add, you bring it up with their parent later, away from the kiddos.\n\nFor another... In my own experience, the only appropriate answer to \"You're not my mom,\" is to acknowledge that that's correct, you're not, and then either apologize for overstepping or explain why you feel justified in doing or saying something parental. CALMLY. like an ADULT. When a kid says that, it's because they feel you've overstepped their boundaries and they are letting you know where those boundaries are. You don't get butthurt about it. ESPECIALLY not when you're SIX MONTHS IN. \ud83d\ude44 Hell, at that point, it isn't even justified getting your feelings hurt over it. You're not even a step-parent. Get a clue.\n\nI can see how the age plays in here as it would be difficult to take someone seriously as a \"parent\" when they're that close in age to you. But tbh, I think she was way out of line regardless of her age (and tbh she sounds pretty immature anyway.)\n\nAlso you don't tell someone else's kid to \"shut up.\" Hell, I have trouble imagining telling my own kid to shut up (maybe in anger in a moment, but I'd certainly feel bad about it.) But definitely not my partner's kid. Wtf.\n\nAnd imo your dad is an AH for standing up for her and not you.\n\nThat's my $.02.", "YTA. You don't need to shut up because she's your mum.

In no way does she have any place to tell you what to do.\n\nYou were getting changed so you deserved some privacy, even if it\u2019s a shared room. She only said shut up because your dad did and you guys listened to him. It was clearly an attempt to get a bit of power of you/wedge her way into the stepmum role. Although to give her a small benefit of the doubt, maybe she was just in a bad mood (not an excuse but it would change her reasons for saying it)\n\nAlso for future reference, maybe get changed in the bathroom sometimes just to save the drama. Especially if he\u2019s already doing something in the bedroom like playing a game or watching tv etc. It is both of your room so you can\u2019t necessarily kick him out if he doesn\u2019t want to leave. So just get changed in the bathroom if he\u2019s busy.\n\nCalling him a creep was unnecessary too, his mind obviously wasn\u2019t in that place so it was creepy on your part to make that comment about your own brother.

Sounds like the gf dumbly followed his lead to back him up, and he is cool with that, so of course he\u2019s going to come down on you.\n\nBut this really feels more like an issue between you and your dad, and the gf happens to be there. It might be a good idea to talk to him about how it makes you feel when someone tells you to shut up, and how you\u2019re tolerating it from him because he is your parent (which rubs me the wrong way on principle), but you don\u2019t like being disrespected.

You should learn to use them in that proportion.
