Her husband Mike and her have 4 young children. Amy recently moved the family from a very expensive home (2.3k rent) to an even more expensive, bigger home with a pool (4k rent). She pretends to be wealthy/instagram-y like all the other mom's in the area.\n\nMike was brought to America as an infant and is not a citizen. He works super hard to provide for Amy and his kids. Amy has not worked since she had her first child. She did have a lucrative in-home nanny job, but would randomly tell the parents she didn't want to watch the child day of and was incredibly unreliable. The parents begged her to be professional, but when Amy moved she refused to give them her new address.\n\nMike is a great Dad. He can be sometimes absent minded, and he is constantly on his phone when he works from home, which Amy hates. Amy constantly complains to me about Mike. If her dog barks while outside, somehow it's Mikes fault. She doesn't want Mike to have his own car, but just purchased a very expensive one for herself and gets mad when she has to drive Mike to work, 15 minutes away. She is so mean to Mike that he literally sleeps in the hallway so he is able to hear the kids at night and help, but not be with her.\n\nShe is constantly miserable, and believes Mike is the root of all her problems. She threatens to take the children and leave nearly weekly. Her biggest complaint is that he works too much and doesn't provide enough.\n\nI am very supportive. I help where ever I can, we talk all the time and I always try to listen to her. But this new round of \"I'm leaving Mike\" just got too much. Mike bought a car. Not even a nice one, but now she no longer has to drive him. She messaged me to complain about the payments and how she'd be so much better off without him. Her plan is to take the kids and he will pay for them to live somewhere else and visit when he can.\n\nI listened. And then I was honest with her. I told her that with or without Mike she will still have the same bills. Rent, car, insurance, electricity, W/S/G, phones/internet... But without Mike she has zero income. I asked her if she was going to work when she leaves Mike to cover her own bills, and if so, why isn't she working now? I also said that she obviously hates Mike, based on how incredibly rude she is to him, constantly.\n\nShe told me I was a jerk for saying that she hates Mike, she didn't appreciate \"tough love\" and now isn't speaking to me. I'm going to be honest, I do miss her but I don't miss the constant negativity.

I think Amy is based off your description of her. Sounds like she is ungrateful for her current situation and instead of doing something about it like getting a job to help support the fancy lifestyle she wants, she is going to use Mike as an excuse. He works hard to provide, but then shes mad that  hes always working? Maybe Mike wouldnt have to work so hard if someone (cough amy cough) got a job and helped with the bills.

One time she went a whole year without talking to me because I told her that giving people the \"silent treatment\" is abuse and when she didn't believe me I told her to google it. She translated that into I was calling her abusive and to \"save me from her abuse\" she just didn't talk to me for an entire year.\n\nI am weirded out by your insistence  that she is made up for karma farming.

My circle includes a very real Amy.", "You're so afraid of her that you posted to a public forum and used her name?  \n\n\nThis is more and more suspicious.", "She doesn't understand reddit and obviously Amy and Mike are not real names.", "Doesn't understand Reddit? What???? That makes no sense. You are totally making this sh!t up.", "Wait how tf is she going to find it if she doesn't understand Reddit??", "NTA your sister sounds like a narcissistic user and abuser. She's salty about Mike getting a car because he has a little bit more freedom. She makes him sleep in hallway!! Constantly threatening to leave is emotionally abusive too. \n\nFrom your post it also sounds like she's living beyond her means and needed to get a job yesterday. You're right in that she doesn't know what side her bread is buttered on and would be in for a shock living as a single parent.", "NTA if you help them out with money I hope you are smart enough to give it to Mike though cause your sister won't be spending it on useful shit", "Poor Mike, she sounds awful - he needs to Lawyer up \n\nNTA", "She sounds like an energy sucker.  People who are so negative all the time suck the energy out of you to the point where you're just exhausted.

Possibly even support that allows her to work if there are available programs. \n\n\nIt was entirely Amy's decision to move...despite the fact that, as the one with no income, Mike definitely had to prove income for the lease.\n\nHow is she buying an expensive car?\n\n\nAlso, why doesn't she work? She has 4 kids....do they require daycare? A lot of people have to quit their jobs when they have little kids because daycare is more than income or absolutely impossible to find. People are put on wait lists while pregnant. \n\n\nIf Mike has issues, he needs to deal with them.

NTA, op.", "She should leave him and then find out that in most states, even if the spouse doesn't have a job, child support is calculated as if you have at least a minimum wage job. And if she lives in a high COL area, it's a good bet that minimum wage is probably about $15/hour, or ~$30k a year. There's no way child support and alimony will be enough for her to continue her lifestyle.\nNTA.", "No no no... you missed what wife meant.  \n\n\nShe wants to move and have Mike live in a box and send all the money to her so that she never has to work again.  \n\n\nThere is still time to save Mike and the kids.

Your sister is\u2026yuck.", "Your sister is selfish and unpleasant. Let's call a spade a spade: she is abusing Mike, and holding their children hostage with her threats to leave with them.\n\nIf her moral failings aren't enough to persuade you to wean yourself of her company, maybe the fact that she is an energy vampire will do?

I mean thats typically what happens ?\n\nI guess Mike is screwed either way", "NTA, your sister actually sounds quite abusive and manipulative. I hope for Mike and the kids sake he grows a pair and kicks her out.", "NTA Seriously If I was Mike I would be thinking of leaving her and taking the kids.

Most times they hurt.", "...It sounds like Amy is financially and probably emotionally abusive.

I feel bad for Mike and the children. NTA op", "If OP was accurate in their storytelling, then she gave out best kind of tough love: it pointed out behaviors, inconsistencies and possible outcomes for the empty threats the sister openly shares, but without trying to assassinate her character. \n\nOP can establish a clear, strong boundary to that habit of her sister's.  Any unwelcome delusional rants will get firehosed with tough love. It may take time, but since the sister has no leverage and probably detracts more (time, effort, etc) than she adds to their relationship, then she will either correct herself or leave her alone. It's a win-win.", "Omg I read the part about $2.3k for rent being expensive and I was like, \"that's not expensive, that's what I pay for my crappy apartment.... Oh.\"\n\nNow I'm wondering where y'all live that rent is so cheap.", "She's probably gaslit him into believing that he'll be deported and/or he'll never see the kids again if he leaves. Why else would he stay?", "If you aren't a mental health professional, stop trying to diagnose people on the internet without any freaking basis for your statements. This is an opinion sub, not a medical advice sub, and you have NO understanding of who her sister really is based on a few paragraphs from a single perspective. Certainly not enough to diagnose her with a \"severe personality disorder\" \n\nIf you are a mental health professional, you should know better than to armchair diagnose online.", "You keep wondering if the post is real and the only one calling YTA. Are you Amy? \ud83d\ude00", "Interesting, you dont think its true, but if it IS true they should stay out of their sisters marriage and just ignore the fact that she is abusing Mike.
