Also, this man is her friend's brother. He's married and has a children (which she was well aware of). The first time they had inappropriate relations, he initiated it by asking her out to dinner. She tried to do the right thing by suggesting they meet up at his sister's house. Even still, he made advances at her that his sister didn\u2019t stop (and somewhat encouraged).

My gf then mentioned that she called him over multiple times with the intent to have sex afterwards, but they still never had \u201csex\u201d. I tried to follow up and ask about the details of these meetings, but she said it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nWe had a pretty big argument because I learned that she still follows this man on IG and likes pictures of he and his wife or he and his kids from time to time.

She was cool with helping someone cheat.", "She\u2019s lusting over him and is keeping him in her circle for when she breaks up with you", "I'm going to go NTA \n\nShe's correct that the details of their affair are none of your business, but the fact she's unwilling to cut off communication with a love interest is a bit concerning. Good luck with this OP.", "Here's the thing. If you have a problem with her character why are you with her? If you are going to be with her, knowing what kind of person she is, none of the details even matter. Whether or not she blocks, mutes, or ghosts him, you don't trust her, and you probably shouldn't. But if you are not going to, then don't be in a relationship with her. Unless you just like the drama, I see zero reason to be with her.\n\nYou don't even sound like you like her.  And if she cared about you, she wouldn't keep dangling this guy in front of you to keep you jealous and insecure. \n\nYou are NTA, but either make a decision to either trust her or end it.", "NTA, but dude, she'll totally end up cheating on you eventually (if she's not already). And while the married guy is the biggest AH for cheating on his wife, your gf is no better than he is because she knew he was married and fooled around with him anyways. She sounds like a disgusting person honestly. Why would you want to be with someone like that?", "Helping a married man cheat aside - Continuing to communicate, and 'liking' pictures of his wife and kids knowing what they did behind their backs? Thats a disgusting human being. And she doesn't understand why you're bothered by it...thats because there is something missing inside of her. These people don't deserve real love. She's still taking that woman for a fool. Shes a coward who doesn't fight fair.", "NTA, but frankly you should just dump her - unless you're ok with being cheated on.  She lacks basic integrity and decency.", "NTA once a cheater always a cheater.", "I don't think I'd date someone like her,  personally. NTA", "Nta she is a homewrecker and she will do what homewreckers do.\n\nMake sure it's not your house getting wrecked.", "My brother in Christ, you don\u2019t need details, you *need* to *run*.", "Run. She's keeping him as a side piece and as soon as he opens the chance for her guess whose bed she'll be in? NTA", "ESH. You suck for pushing for more 'details'. What additional details could you possibly need?! She'd already been relatively explicit with you in terms of what happened with this guy.\n\nPersonally I think there's a distinct lack of integrity here on her part. She had an affair with him and likes photos of his family on insta- knowing fine well what he did. I think that's all you honestly need to know and it says a lot about her character.", "NAH. All of that happened before you were in her life, it\u2019s none of your business. If she\u2019s choosing to keep him in her life now (no matter how minimal she feels the contact is) After you\u2019ve expressed that you\u2019re uncomfortable with it, then you now know how little she respects you and your feelings. \n\nIs that what you want in a relationship? Sounds like it\u2019s a new one and you\u2019re already obsessing over her past, it\u2019s only going to get worse, and you\u2019ll have lost all that time for nothing but heartache. YOU choose how people treat you by what you allow. He\u2019s said he wants her sexually and shes said she\u2019s not cutting contact. If You\u2019re not comfortable, You have to be responsible for your own heart and cut this off before it gets worse because she\u2019s made it clear she will do whatever she wants, regardless of how it makes you feel. Go find a partner that actually wants a healthy relationship instead of this lady that needs a \u201cback burner\u201d man.", "Yikes, YTA here for staying in this relationship.", "YTA. You don't get to tell her what to do or who she can be friends with. You can decide not to be with her because of it, but that's all.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m personally in a very secure, healthy, and non-jealous marriage and I still requested my husband unfollow his ex on Instagram (it wasn\u2019t even as bad of a situation like yours where she was married. They just dated). She\u2019s reached out a few times where he\u2019s ignored her, but still insanely annoying. He asked why and I said it made me uncomfortable. He simply did what I asked cause our relationship and my feelings is a priority to him. Has not been an issue since. \n\nIf she is refusing to simply remove someone off of social media cause you are voicing that it is uncomfortable for you, you may want to reevaluate her priorities in general. Also just the fact that she did cheat with a married man (AH) and continues to show interest on social media in his life (AH), she seems like an attention seeking brat that enjoys rocking the boat/the adrenaline of knowing she\u2019s the other woman. \n\nMy advice, leave. She doesn\u2019t respect you, your feelings, or the poor wife/family of the man she cheated with. Her values are completely off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didn't want explicit details", "I think the only reason I have a problem is because he's mentioned that he's not going to stop trying to have sex with her until she's married.  It's not so much about them just being friends for me. I don't think ex-lovers have to hate each other or not still be friends.", "Thank you for sharing. It sounds like you and your husband have the type of marriage I aspire to have someday.", "She wasn't a cheater then - she was enabling a cheater. Though I would also say maintaining this connection with the cheater could be labelled as an emotional affair - since she doesn't seem to want to let him go, which makes her a cheater on OP.", "Who was she cheating on?  She was single.  It wasn't her job to enforce HIS vows.  He's the cheater, not her.  If she and the current boyfriend have agreed to be exclusive and she's in a relationship with the other guy now, then she's a current cheater, but we don't know that.\n\nClearly there are issues with this whole thing, and I personally have never understood why someone would knowingly get into a relationship with someone who is already committed to someone else, but when it comes to contracts, you can't break a contract you are not a party to.", "Then I think you aready have your answer", "It sounds like you have a boundary that she doesn't respect, which is fine. But instead of demanding she do something, maybe just move on, since she downcast are anything wrong with their relationship.\n\nAre there other areas of conflict, or is this the only one?", "Yes, she was a cheater then. She was intimate with a married man. That makes her a cheater.\n\nShe does not need to be in a relationship and sleeping with someone else to be a cheater, as long as one of the two is in a relationship then they're both cheaters.", "It's called common decency, don't sleep with a married man. Doing so is cheating, even if she's not technically cheating on anyone - s she's cheating with someone.\n\nTrying to defend this, or claim it's not cheating, is kinda gross of you.", "This general idea of trust is the only area of conflict. But I guess given how fundamental that is to a relationship, it may not be fair for me to stay if I can't fully trust her", "Well...you told me! Someone call up Oxford Dictionary and let them know their definition needs changing!"]}
