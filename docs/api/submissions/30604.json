It doesn\u2019t say if the brother showed the mother the laptop, just that he told her. When I was in middle school, there was boys in similar situations and blamed it on/used their siblings laptop so they wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. The brother making it up could be a possibility (20% imo) It\u2019s also the fact that this laptop hasn\u2019t been used in three years and the OP stopped using it because it was slow so I\u2019m confused on how that computer could reload tabs or still have saved the history on it", "that\u2019s\u2026a very weird comparison to a teenage boy watching porn, but okay lol. i\u2019m sure that\u2019s what his brothers gonna be doing in a few years anyway", "The brother is smart.  He set already blamed all future history  on his brother using the laptop previously heh"]}
