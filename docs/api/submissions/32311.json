She and her husband had plans to come by our home after they came back from picking up their 1 year old son from her mom\u2019s house. When they arrived she was extremely angry and distraught and explained that her husband dropped her and baby off while he looked for parking, but she saw a spot open up nearby so she tried to hold it by standing in the spot with her son in stroller. A man got to the spot first and started to back his car into the spot despite seeing her and the baby there and she was forced to move out of the way. She said she went off on him, cursing and saying that he\u2019s an evil person to steal a parking spot from a baby and to endanger them by backing into the spot. The man apparently gave her a big F you and said her name isn\u2019t on the spot. \n\nHonestly, I wanted to stay neutral on the matter, especially after my husband confirmed with her and via house camera that the man very slowly backed in and clearly was not trying to run them over. SIL was clearly upset and shaken up over it but she kept talking about how awful the man was hours after they arrived and her husband kept validating her which made her  feel like my husband and I would be on the same page. She kept asking for our input and we kept skirting around it with plenty of \u201cthat\u2019s crazy\u201d and \u201cso sorry that happened to you\u201d.

There were plenty of other parking spots (she should know as she lives in the neighborhood) and she can\u2019t assume that everyone will pass her by when they see her holding a spot just because she has a baby. What if the man got angry and backed in without giving her time to move? I also told her that she can\u2019t force anyone to not take a public parking spot. \n\nShe got huffy and said that she knew I wouldn\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a parent and that I can\u2019t comprehend how traumatic the experience was for her. Her husband said that the man should not have backed into the spot and just talked to her if he needed it that badly. I told them that I do understand that it was scary for SIL and that it was messed up for the man to back in, but ultimately, no one is entitled to a public parking spot and she shouldn\u2019t have put her and baby in the street to begin with.

Have a genuine sit down with SIL to express concern and check in. I still don\u2019t think an in the moment, call out was helpful and just escalated things. Wasn\u2019t the time or the way.", "While I agree that bullying is definitely trauma, there is a HUGE difference between bullying and a situation you caused yourself like OP\u2019s SIL did.", "Yes, and it\u2019s important that we not indulge that sort of histrionic behavior. The end.", "I would definitely SILs actions as dangerous because she put herself and her child in the way of a vehicle to prevent them to park in a public spot. People can be unpredictable. Sure, this time it *only* shook her up and ruined everyone's day. But it could have been different if that stranger was a more dangerous stranger. SIL is a mother in charge of her baby's safety. Not her own convenience. OP states there was other parking and that she went through \"that's crazy\" and everything...OP is NTA who even holds a parking spot with a body?", "Fair enough - I live in a sleepy small town so I guess I was picturing it differently. Standing in a parking lot here wouldn\u2019t be a big deal - just had a winter festival and it was a pretty common occurrence. But I can see how in a different place maybe that\u2019s a more risky/intense action.", "Standing in a parking lot is different than holding a spot that a car is trying to park in. SIL was out of line even if there was no baby or danger. It's worse that she made her kid a part of it. Then worse again she didn't even see what she did wrong. Then to bring it all back up after it was over, then to not let it go several more times. She expected this man to talk to her? About what? Seems his intentions were clear...just a guy out here trying to park his car in a parking spot.", "ESH.  No baby was \"endangered\", but sure, she was the one that brought the baby to the sacred parking spot.  Why engage?", "NTA yeah the guy backing into the spot had issues but SIL is the one who endangered her child by standing there while it happened.", "NTA.  Standing in a spot isn't going to force anyone to give it up.  The endangerment was on her for being short sighted enough not to realize this.  She put the proximity of parking ahead of her baby, assuming that it would be enough to guilt someone into letting her have the spot.  She learned a lesson here.", "NTA- I also feel like I saw this on TikTok. Your SIL is the AH.", "NTA she\u2019s just lucky that this time all the guy did was cuss her out, there\u2019s all kinds of crazy\u2019s everywhere and one day one may not be so kind", "NTA, if this is not a thing in your area.\n\nIn PR, during holiday shopping we respect holding a spot, but the car has to be close by, maybe one row over and be hurrying to park.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is the kid-on-bike-who-puts-stick-into-his-own-wheel meme.", "NTA - this woman just realized that she is not on the top of the food chain with her entitled attitude and that's what shook her up. That she didn't get her way - not because she was in danger. A baby doesn't give you cart blanche to be at the top of the world and own everytyhing. She's probably a narcissist and thinks she runs the world and since they left when you \"went against her\" that's a very narcissistic thing to do...", "nah, SIL was standing in the spot.

Up there with line cutters, and people who leave shopping carts in the middle of the parking lot.", "Where I'm from we have a saying; \"The most dangerous man in the world is the man who is cornered and has nothing to lose.\"", "They tried not answering but SIL kept pushing for them to give an opinion", "About a month ago SIL physically took a shopping cart away from an older woman in Target who just started to walk with it. She didn\u2019t want to get one from the parking lot. She told the woman she needed the cart because she has a baby and he was crying. Another man saw what happened and got a new cart for the woman. I was really embarrassed and apologized to the woman, did separate shopping and acted like I didn\u2019t know SIL in the store. SIL said I was being dramatic for apologizing. So yeah, I guess she does act pretty entitled at times. She wasn\u2019t like that before she got pregnant and had her son.", "It was probably someone calling the SIL a name.", "Yes you can. Whether you should is a different discussion.", "I suspected it started after pregnancy.  Some women think they become nobility when they give birth.
