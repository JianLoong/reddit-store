{"id": 32311, "submission_id": "18ae71m", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL that she endangered her baby?", "selftext": "My (29F) SIL (33F) lives in the same community as me and my husband (32M). She and her husband had plans to come by our home after they came back from picking up their 1 year old son from her mom\u2019s house. When they arrived she was extremely angry and distraught and explained that her husband dropped her and baby off while he looked for parking, but she saw a spot open up nearby so she tried to hold it by standing in the spot with her son in stroller. A man got to the spot first and started to back his car into the spot despite seeing her and the baby there and she was forced to move out of the way. She said she went off on him, cursing and saying that he\u2019s an evil person to steal a parking spot from a baby and to endanger them by backing into the spot. The man apparently gave her a big F you and said her name isn\u2019t on the spot. \n\nHonestly, I wanted to stay neutral on the matter, especially after my husband confirmed with her and via house camera that the man very slowly backed in and clearly was not trying to run them over. SIL was clearly upset and shaken up over it but she kept talking about how awful the man was hours after they arrived and her husband kept validating her which made her  feel like my husband and I would be on the same page. She kept asking for our input and we kept skirting around it with plenty of \u201cthat\u2019s crazy\u201d and \u201cso sorry that happened to you\u201d. I had enough of it and told her that I am sorry that that happened to her and that I understand that it was scary, but even though it wasn\u2019t her intent, she was the one endangering her child by forcing herself and baby into the road to hold a spot. There were plenty of other parking spots (she should know as she lives in the neighborhood) and she can\u2019t assume that everyone will pass her by when they see her holding a spot just because she has a baby. What if the man got angry and backed in without giving her time to move? I also told her that she can\u2019t force anyone to not take a public parking spot. \n\nShe got huffy and said that she knew I wouldn\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a parent and that I can\u2019t comprehend how traumatic the experience was for her. Her husband said that the man should not have backed into the spot and just talked to her if he needed it that badly. I told them that I do understand that it was scary for SIL and that it was messed up for the man to back in, but ultimately, no one is entitled to a public parking spot and she shouldn\u2019t have put her and baby in the street to begin with. They decided to leave when they couldn\u2019t get me to agree with them and my husband and I feel bad because SIL genuinely was shaken up. Just wondering if we are AHoles and should apologize and make peace.", "created_utc": 1701671026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ae71m/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_she_endangered_her/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The guy gave her plenty of time to move. As for 'if he needed the spot, he should have talked to her?' What, he should have blocked the street and asked her to move, which *of course* she would have done. /s This is the same lady that called him evil for taking a publicly available parking spot. \n\nYou responded correctly, acknowledged that it scared her, and didn't call her a ninny for standing in the street with her baby. They took offense over you not wholeheartedly agreeing that they had the right to that space, because baby!\n\n You are in the right, but this also seems like a strange hill to die on.

And once we get stupid and dangerous out of the way, let\u2019s add entitled. Once someone pulled up and was going to use the spot she should have moved immediately.
