My Husband's sister has 3 children, an 8th month old baby, a 3 1/2 year old, and a 6 year old. My Husband and I do not have kids, nor are we planning to have any. His parents and aforementioned sister live about 3 hours away. Because we have less \"baggage,\" we are typically the ones who will travel to see them, usually every month or so. \n\nPreviously, his parents, sister and her husband and her kids have done day trips to visit us (they all prefer to go home and sleep in their same beds, it's not that we haven't offered for them to stay). Anyway, the last time the entire group came, our nieces were very poorly behaved. Now before you say \"THEY'RE KIDS\"- I'm talking about playing on the stairs, jumping on the future, wiping their dirty hands on the walls, etc. things kids do, sure, but when in someone else's home, you'd assume their parents would try to limit this kind of behavior. However, my SIL and her husband do not believe in disciplining their children. I'm not talking \"gentle parenting\", I mean, as soon as a tantrum gets going, their immediate reaction is to give them whatever they want, immediately fix whatever their problem is, without explanation. \n\nMy Husband mentioned that he would like the group to visit this weekend, and I'm really not interested. I don't mind if my mother and father in law come, but I tried nicely to explain to my Husband that I'd prefer his sister and the kids not come along as well. He was not pleased. I'm not trying to be an asshole, and I generally like my SIL and her husband, but in my opinion, if they're not going to discipline the kids (or allow others to set boundaries within their own home) I don't think they should be allowed here. I'm not saying forever, but I think until her kiddos clam down a bit, then it's better for our familial relationship if we stick to visiting them at their home, where they can do as they'd like.

You are allowed to set boundaries and they should be respected.  However, this is you husbands family.   Yeah you going to their place is good for the children to not ruin/disrupt your home but that\u2019s 6 hours in the car for you and/or your husband.    Perhaps you/he don\u2019t have the time and the traveling family does or he doesn\u2019t want to be in the car for that long.   \n\nAll that being said yes of course the issue of uncontrollable offspring needs addressed.  \n\nI think starting with a mindset of \u201chow do we fix/improve their behavior when visiting\u201d vs \u201cno visiting until they fix/improve their behavior\u201d would be much better for a healthy and happy family and relationship dynamic.  \n\nAlso as someone else suggested they can visit you while limiting the actual time in your home.  \n\nGo have a grill out in a park/go to the zoo/etc.    then maybe they are only in your home for 30-60 minutes while enjoying a several hour visit of family time.", "YTA.   Instead of having a discussion with him or with them about the situation you arbitrarily decide they aren't welcome.   Use your words.", "NTA \n\nMaybe suggest getting a hotel for them and just spending time anywhere other than your home", "NTA but I understand why your husband is upset, that\u2019s his family. Y\u2019all need a compromise. Offer for everyone to spend the day at a nearby garden or zoo or park and everyone (parents included) needs to get an Airbnb or hotel if they plan on staying.", "NTA.  Let them visit. You go to a hotel and enjoy yourself.  Let your husband deal with the prep, the poor behavior and parenting, and the cleanup. It'll be the last time he invites them to stay.", "They don;t believe in disciplining their children? That's cute.\n\nWell, you don't believe in having your house invaded by a pack of feral offspring. You can meet at some neutral ground like a restaurant or a pool or something and see how well that goes, when three unruly kids make everyone around them feel terrible.", "NTA\n\nJust don't entertain them at home.", "Did you read the post, the discussion is literally what happened", "NTA \n\nBut your husband is part of the issue. Tell him to talk to his sister and explain your house has rules that need to be followed when the children are in your home.", "This is another situation for my favourite implement the AIRHORN!\n\nTell your husband you\u2019ve found a solution, and pre-warn your IL\u2019s that everytime they misbehave in your home you will blast it. \u201cWell if you don\u2019t want to disciple your children I\u2019ll find a way to distract them!\u201d When the baby starts kicking off too then I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll leave quickly!", "NTA and if your husband does convince you to let them come over, make it very clear to him that he's cleaning up after them not you", "NTA. I wouldn't be fond of this kind of visit either. I get your husband he wants to see them.

I strongly suspect that would fall on OP.", "That's the worst suggestion, I promise OP will come back to total destruction. \n\nPrecious and sentimental items lost/stolen after the kids ransacked closets and drawers they shouldn't have gone into and now 3 1/2 can't be parted from OP's childhood teddy and the pretty earrings 6 decided to wear to the park, OP's great grandmother's diamonds, fell off somewhere.\n\nValuable possessions broken because husband decided to make a point of not giving into a tantrum so 6 hurled something into the TV.\n\nExpensive repairs needed after 3 1/2 played multiple rounds of \"does it flush?\" causing the toilet to flood the upstairs bathroom and in turn collapse the ceiling below.\n\nAnd where is the money to make right all of it going to come from, if it can even be made right? Their joint finances.\n\nHard NO.", "This is the way.", "Well put. ESH. \u201cOur house -> our rules\u201d is a perfectly reasonable approach. 2 of the kids are school age so they should have an idea of how to behave in a more controlled environment. OP and her husband need to lay down the law at the beginning of the visit and be firm about it. If husband can\u2019t support that, then it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for OP to take a day out for herself and he can be responsible for managing the chaos and the clean up.", "Then she goes back to the hotel", "NTA \u2026 when I was 10, my parents had a Christmas party at our house.  A lot of family and friends.  my cousin came with his wife and 4 kids.  The kids were terrors\u2026 we knew they were not well behaved before they came\u2026 but their behavior was so bad, I got conscripted to follow them around trying to prevent catastrophes.  Dumping food on the floor. Pouring drinks on the carpet, intentionally\u2026 it was bad\u2026 the parents did not believe in discipline Of any kind.  my mom finally cracked (it was my dad\u2019s side of the family), and she told the parents that they need to get their kids and leave, immediately and she didn\u2019t want what them near her house until They were all over the age of 18\u2026 they were angry, they left, it caused some drama in the family, but not too much because everyone recognized that all of the kids were out of control. (in their own house, soaked the mattresses with water, rolled a burning log out of the fireplace and onto the floor, threw food in the pool\u2026)\n\nso, I support you that you don\u2019t want them in your house until they can behave.  If they are anything like my cousins, they aren\u2019t going to get better until they become adults and are held accountable for their behavior by society\u2026\n\nI have to wonder why your husband wants them to visit, surely you and hubby have a wonderful life to live and adventures or weekend getaways to go on?  If not, I suggest you get busy adding things to your calendar.", "NTA. Did your husband clean up after his sister's kids last time? Because whatever he did before is likely what he'll do again.

Unless you won't your husband to disregard the mess his family makes in your home, do NOT clean up after them again. Just go for a vacation with friends or literally leave the trash they drop alone and let the walls remain dirty. \n\nHe probably thought it took you less than an hour to clean up after the mess they left behind last time so it's not a big deal if they return.", "Unfortunately with parents who give in to their whims these kids are not going to calm down a bit.\n\nEither way you are NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA and holy crap, these are going to be horribly disappointed children when no one else in the rest of the world just gives them what they want when they whine about it.
