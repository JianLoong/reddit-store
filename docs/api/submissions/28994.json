Likewise guacamole has entered the English language to mean the same thing it does in Spanish, but pronouncing it in the local English dialect\u2019s accent doesn\u2019t make it wrong. I\u2019m Australian - if I say New York as \u2018Nyoo Y\u00e5k,\u2019 am I wrong?

It just feels distrispectful and it's not about the language, it's just the lack of respect to the language that you are showing.\n\nHowever, it does seem like this specific word is the same in English, there are many English words that aren't etymologically English and it would be weird if we all start trying to suddenly infuse accents of other languages into the language we are speaking depending on the origin of the words.\n\nOn a side note about racism that I see being discussed in other comments.I lived in 5 different countries speaking 5 different languages. I speak some of them without an accent and some with. The point of speaking another language is to effectively communicate. Demanding a perfect accent from a person for whom that language is not native is defo either racist or hiding some other pain. From the examples you provided, it is equally racist for English speakers to demand that Spanish speakers speak English with no accent, as it is for Spanish speakers to demand that English speakers speak spanish with no accept. It is a foreign language to either sides. And if she says it is different, it is not. Would it be the same if you moved to a Spanish speaking country were Spanish was  majority language, the language of the country and then they demanded you speak with no accent? Would it it be racist then? The cause of the racism might be different, one coming from hurt while the other coming from arrogance... the action is still discriminatory based on perception of race or culture that is recognised via language as a representation.", "YTA for thinking holy moly guacamole is cute and silly.

Americans can be racist to other white people for example when that person is a white foreigner eg Polish, or Croatian etc. Other countries have their own most prevelent types of racism. Countires that are not white, eg. Latin American countries, Asian countries, African countries can absolutely discriminate against white people cause they are the foreigners there. Not the whole world is USA. Different countries have their own problems.
