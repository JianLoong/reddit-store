I speak some of them without an accent and some with. The point of speaking another language is to effectively communicate. Demanding a perfect accent from a person for whom that language is not native is defo either racist or hiding some other pain. From the examples you provided, it is equally racist for English speakers to demand that Spanish speakers speak English with no accent, as it is for Spanish speakers to demand that English speakers speak spanish with no accept. It is a foreign language to either sides. And if she says it is different, it is not. Would it be the same if you moved to a Spanish speaking country were Spanish was  majority language, the language of the country and then they demanded you speak with no accent? Would it it be racist then? The cause of the racism might be different, one coming from hurt while the other coming from arrogance... the action is still discriminatory based on perception of race or culture that is recognised via language as a representation.", "YTA for thinking holy moly guacamole is cute and silly.

Some total AH put up this big, ugly, rusty fence. We can hardly see across the river now.   Well anyway, I spent many an annoying and humorous lunch hour trying to teach a native Mexican how to properly say bitch and driveway.  She just couldn't pronounce those 2 words.  Bitch always came out beech.  She could say itch, but not bitch.  And making the \"v\" sound was impossible.  She even spelled driveway dribe-bu-way.  I explained how to put your upper teeth on your lower lip to make the \"v\" sound.  She could do that.  Until it was time to put it in a word.  I think the funniest thing she ever said was \"we need to move our beek-als.\". Beek-als?  What is a beek-als?  Vehichle.  We needed to move our vehicles.

We do have an obligation to try to say the foreign word properly. We speak English with our accustomed relaxed pronunciation.

One I hate a lot is when people think they are saying \" voil\u00e0 \" (Look, here it is) in French, and they pronounce it, wallah. Oh, dear.
