This is complex and I don't think you're an ah. Good on you for keeping Amy safe at gout house. There needs to be some compromise on all sides though. Amy's grandmother is ill and that is likely stressing everyone. Lily is a bit obnoxious and needs a discuss about respecting  her sister's privacy and her stuff...it seems that she's understand that she messed up, bur probably needs to talk with someone. Your BIL seems a bit unreasonable in the way he's handling this, but he's under significant stress and he's not entirely wrong. Amy is being overly sensitive to her sister going through her stuff. She will need to face going home, probably within a day or 2. She needs to talk to her parents and her sister about how she's feeling. Your sister needs to facilitate a conversation to mediate all of this; but might be a little overwhelmed with her ill MIL, stressed husband, and fighting kids. You're not a bad person for giving Amy a place, but keeping her when her parents want her to return home isn't your place either. Everyone needs to compromise and discuss all that's going on. You don't get to determine the time frame though, your getting involved is likely exacerbate drama between your BIL and niece. Get your sister over and let her start the discussion with Amy.", "NTA,\n\nBut what I will say..

All the yelling, screaming and threatening, not to mention trying to forcibly remove his 16yo kid and refusing to leave until you threaten to call the police.\n\nTbh that's all concerning. \n\nYou're not wrong to give your niece a break, your niece isn't wrong to be frustrated and utterly done with her sister, your brother and sil aren't wrong to have had to take in the mother who is injured. \n\nThe 11 yo is kind of a dick, the parents are kinda assholes for not pulling the younger sister up more. \n\nHave you sat down and asked your niece what her plans are?

You\u2019re giving a kid who has already run away from home at least once, a safe place to stay. Nothing more. Nothing less. I would keep your door open to her and otherwise try your best not to get in the middle of it more than you have to. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't keeping her from her dad. She ran away after her sister violated her privacy. All you're doing is providing a safe place for Amy to stay. It's clear they all need some family therapy.", "NTA. Is Amy Dan\u2019s kid? Cause this of giving major evil stepfather energy.", "What an unpleasant family altogether.\n\nNTA but make your sister sort this out asap, this is not your decision or your responsibility", "Yta. I grew up in a similar situation.  I was the young sibling.  You are enabling the sister to run away. You should back away from the situation and let the parents deal with the siblings.  You are only making it harder for the parents to have the older sibling listen and be respectful.", "Sounds like Lily takes after Dad, who doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. Amy isn\u2019t complaining about sharing a room; she\u2019s complaining about her sister\u2019s snooping and stealing. Your sister seems to understand the problems and is trying to protect Amy by letting her stay with you. The reality is that Amy only has two more years before she can decide her own fate and Dad needs to smarten up. Some counselling is in order. NTA for giving Amy a safe space.", "NTA. Someone needs to get through to the father that if he pushes too hard he will lose any future relationship with her.\n\nWhen children become teens, the authoritarian style causes more harm than good. He needs to start to treating his daughter like the young adult she is becoming - listen, respect and discuss options.", " NTA\n\nAll you're doing is giving your niece a safe space to be while she works out her upsets and differences with her parents.\n\nMom and Dad are nowhere near on the same page. Give your niece some time to take a break from them.  Doesn't matter what Dads childhood looked like. His daughter isn't living his childhood so that's not a reflection of her experience.  Sharing a room has been hard on her.  She needs space.  She is taking space with her aunt nearby.  Why is this so problematic to Dad?", "I wonder if Lily\u2019s tears were real.\n\nShe might have just been crying crocodile tears to try and get her way, or her delightful father might have threatened her into it.\n\nWhile Lily is the GC, I bet he\u2019s awfully embarrassed that Amy won\u2019t come home. But not enough to ask her what\u2019s wrong and try and find a solution or even a compromise.", "NTA. Seems like Lily is the golden child. Good thing Amy had a safe place to go and it was very good of you to take her in. Lily is a brat. Seems like the real problem here is Dan. he probably bulldozed his way through Sue to go to your house.", "Are you in the US? If so, what state?\n\nAt 16 many \"children\" can become \"emancipated minors\" if their living situations are not good. You're not kidnapping her, but her home life right now is not acceptable. \n\nLily is obviously spoiled, but Amy shouldn't sacrifice her privacy for that. You may want to contact your local social services agencies to see what kind of action you should take moving forward. Because Amy is two years from being an \"adult\", her wishes will be taken into consideration.", "Any advice on how to do that? I feel like I just keep making it worse. Last time my bil came over I really tried to mediate but it just ended with him and my niece screaming at each other through a closed door. I\u2019m mostly sure he was bluffing about calling the police? My sister seems to have zero interest in making her come back right now. I think you\u2019re right and she\u2019s stressed. I was hoping maybe things would go back to normal on their own if my niece just stays here a couple days until everyone\u2019s calmed down but everyone\u2019s just getting angrier and I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m inadvertently causing that", "That\u2019s his argument.

At this point I\u2019m just not sure she will.", "I'm so sorry you never learned this lesson but when someone displays abusive behaviours you're meant to seperate yourself from them. \n\nNow I assume your counter argument will involve how high your threshold for counting behaviour as abuse is.", "Oh, I didn\u2019t threaten to call the police, he did. He tried to force his way into the bathroom but eventually gave up and left, but he basically said I was keeping his child from him and if I didn\u2019t send her back soon he\u2019d call the cops on me, which I\u2019m now worried he might. My sister says he was just frustrated.\n\nMy niece keeps evading the issue. She says if I want her to leave she\u2019ll leave but she\u2019ll ask to stay at a friend\u2019s house or something. She knows it\u2019s not a good long term solution but she says if she goes back home right now she\u2019ll go insane", "Id agree if there was evidence of abuse but this  is just sibling arguments and a teenager not wanting to listen", "I wonder what it\u2019s considered legally. Depends on the country I guess. Plus the mom seems to be on board", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being disrespectful at all but she\u2019s definitely not interested in working this out at the moment and in that I guess I am enabling her.

CPS will likely return her to her house.", "I\u2019ll keep that in mind for a worst case scenario. Taking those kinds of steps without trying other things first would feel like a betrayal against my sister but even she seems to see that everyone needs some space right now. I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to educate myself on this now so I can talk options with my niece", "Sounds like sis and bil didn't listen to their older child until this situation exploded. And bil puts more fuel to the fire. Maybe your niece can stay until grandma can return home.", "I think you can try talking to your niece first. Ask  your sister to come over when you do. Tell Amy you understand that it's tough right now and that what her sister did was hurtful. Mention that her sister is genuinely remorseful and while she's not obligated to immediately be back to normal, it's important to forgive when someone is genuine - not only for her sister, but for her sake. Tell her you understand that she's upset with her dad, but talk about how he may be stressed. Then ask if she's willing to have her mom facilitate a conversation. Tell her you're not going to kick her out, but that running away doesn't solve problems. Offer kindness and support, but let her know she will have to return home and address what's been going on.", "Keeping her from facing her family won't do her any good in the long run and will only prolong the issue.  She's going to need to work on it...if she refuses there's nothing you can do.", "That\u2019s not true.  She tried to work it out and Lily was being a brat.  When she tried to complain about it to her parents, they blew her off.  At 16, she doesn\u2019t yet have the skills to work this out because she has no authority over Lily.  She can\u2019t make Lily behave.  Your sister seems checked out.  And Dan just wants to bully his oldest in to complying with his demands.\n\nIt seems that Dan has absolutely no insight to teenage girls.  There is a big difference between teenage girls and teenage boys.  Boys don\u2019t care about sharing.  Girls do, especially when they have always had their own room.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Dan and Sue are doing nothing to show Amy how long she is going to be out of her room.  Is this 6 weeks? 8 weeks? 12 weeks?  When you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, it is a lot easier to suck it up and deal.  Amy at 16 needs some privacy, and her stuff needs to be respected.  How are Dan and sue recognizing Amy\u2019s needs??  They seem to only be focused on punishment and not finding a solution for everyone.\n\nI would suggest that you need to keep being Amy\u2019s safe haven, because you don\u2019t want her running away and falling prey to traffickers or whatever.  You should ask your sister over to discuss what I have said above.  Dan and Sue have less than 2 years before Amy is a legal adult and can just leave and never contact them again.  They need to start recognizing that if they don\u2019t start respecting her needs, they will lose her when she becomes an adult.", "Well,\n\nWhat about her going to college and getting a car and having funds.. are you going to fund all that?? \n\nBut you are enabling her to basically hide and not face up to reality", "Nothing was abusive..", "If you have written proof from your sister like a text saying she can stay you need to keep it. Make things easier if he does call the police", "NTA. I am happy your niece has someone safe. She is showing she trusts you. Coming from a home with two emotionally immature parents, in my opinion,  your niece is begging for help even though she is shutting down when you ask her questions. This isn't just running away. There seems to be a lot more going on that she doesn't feel safe to say, or she is assuming that she will be ignored. On the outside, everything looked fine when people looked at our family. Our family was not okay. She is sixteen, and she is clearly showing her needs are not being met, notndoes she feel heard. Promises of change is not the answer if they really do not change. Her father is showing you and her that he is not, himself,  able to cool off and be mature to work this issue(s) to work towards a resolution. The manipulation to you and your niece is not good with the anger, manipulation (with threats of authority), and physical abuse when he put his hands on her to remove her from your home.  That is just not excusable, and it is wrong. Gently talk to your niece and ask her if she feels safe at her home. She needs to be heard and sewn right now.  If he calls the police, be honest.  If you feel she is not safe, state it. Tell her you love her and she has your support.  Hopefully, she will open up  more. She definitely would benefit from talking to a therapist. I would encourage her to do that. You are not her Mom, but it doesn't mean you can't support her and make sure she is going to be okay as well as safe.", "Honestly the disrespect seems to be coming from the little sister and dad, not the older daughter. She's reached her limit in patience and was going to leave, period. What you've done is given her refuge, and now she can try and deal with it all from the safety of your home. Quite frankly, the dad is giving off authoritarian vibes, I mean it doesn't sound like even your sister is able to get him to be reasonable. The fact is, your niece is a young woman, not a child, but he doesn't seem to have any respect for her as such. It sucks you're in this position, but definitely NTA.", "Back out of the situation.  If the kid isn't in danger do not enable her running away.  I now have no relationship with my sister or the person that enabled her.  It's put a strain on my family for 25 years", "Would they?

Her parent yelling at her occasionally isn't going to require a nuclear option.", "There are multiple issues going on here. The elderly mother needing care, Lily being an obvious brat, and the father's complete and total lack of empathy or understanding. \n\nThey all need a break from each other. Sounds like the dad just expected everyone to fall into line, and he wasn't firm enough with Lily. Amy is at an age when she just cannot lose all her privacy and not be expected to react. \n\nAnd it is **not** betraying your sister to make sure your niece has a soft place to land. You're likely helping out the entire family with this. You're a great aunt. Keep up the good work.", "I feel like that would be the best solution. I\u2019m still hoping that my sister will smooth things over with her husband. Or let\u2019s my niece get some more of her things, otherwise this isn\u2019t going to work anyway once school starts again", "NTA   But it\u2019s a tricky situation to manage moving forward. You need to let Amy know this is not a permanent or long term solution & that the same would be true about her threat to stay at a friends house. That currently she\u2019s allowed to stay with you because her moms ok with it & if that changes she has to go back home. In light of her having to return home at some point, initiate a conversation about what she needs in order for moving home to feel manageable. Explain that both she & her parents will have to compromise & make an effort. \n\nI think you should look up resources for both individual & family counseling wherever you live. If those are hard to access a school guidance counselor or a teen crisis hotline could help short term. While you should keep helping how you can, Amy\u2019s dad is right that down the road she will continue to use you as a way out of directly addressing problems with her parents. You are not the best equipped person to teach her how to do that & she could use professional help. \n\nI agree with others that your BIL anger issues & sisters disengagement are worrisome. My guess is that dynamic is the real root of Amy\u2019s problems vs having to short term share a room with an annoying sibling.", "OP isn't keeping her from her family, she asked the mother if she was fine with it and she was. All of this unfolded with nothing to do with OP except it being in her house. OP is just a neutral third party in all this. OP is doing the right thing by not getting involved and not telling her sister and BIL how to parent their kids. If they can't work this out, the family should get some counseling.", "It will absolutely do her good in the long run.\n\n\nShe has space to get away from her shitty father until she's old enough to support her own ability to stay away from her shitty father.", "I agree and I've upvoted you but this\n\n>Boys don\u2019t care about sharing\n\nIs not true, I had 2 younger brothers and having to share did bother me. My son also at times hates sharing with his sister", "You\u2019re just an A H yourself with all your comments. OP is someone trying to look out for her niece and you\u2019re missing the bigger picture. \n\nShut up, Dan.", "God no, I hope this will be resolved in a week at most, I\u2019m just not sure how to go about it. While she\u2019s here I can at least try to talk to her, try to figure things out. Then again that hasn\u2019t really worked so far", "Incorrect, unfortunately.", "I guess with a vivid imagination you could count him trying to physically move her as abusive.", "I do. She has repeatedly texted me I should just keep my niece with me for a bit and that she\u2019ll talk to her husband", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that, I hope you\u2019re doing better now.\n\nThat thing about change is exactly what she said. I asked what she thought would happen if she went home and she said for a week or so her mom and sister would be nice and her dad would best case scenario ignore her existence and afterwards everything would go back to normal. She says it\u2019s suffocating and she wishes she was 18 already", "Yeah, again, that\u2019s the worst case scenario. Best case scenario for me is everyone calms down and moves back when school starts again", "OP providing a shelter is great short term. Allowing the kid to stay when her parents want her home isn't fine, and letting her stay indefinitely isn't a solution. OP can talk to the kid, bring the mom to talk, then needs to let the kid go with mom to resolve the other stuff at home.", "Most boys ight mind sharing their stuff like video games, etc, but they usually don\u2019t care about sharing a room with each other, unlike girls who prefer to have their privacy in their room.  Of course these are generalizations\u2026", "It hasn't worked so far, because Amy doesn't want it to work..

I really empathize with her. It is a very lonely place to be at a young age. From what she said, it seems like there is emotional neglect and emotional immaturity in her home. She isn't crazy and she is 100% allowed to speak how she feels, and it is 100% valid. The behavior her Dad is showing her is stonewalling, and he sounds emotionally immature. Mom seems complicit and emotionally immature, which is not good at all.  Her sister is 11 and a child in the same household, so she isn't responsible for their parents' behavior. She still needs understanding and time to grow and mature, too. Morgan Pommels, a therapist, speaks about this.  Dr. Sherrie, another therpist, speaks on this. There is a book called Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, as well as others out you can read too. Just do a Google search. They have an online presence. Keep listening to understand and ask her what she needs. Sometimes, it may be something as sumple as a hug and that you aren't judging here, even if she makes mistakes.  No one is perfect. Again, therapy is strongly encouraged so she can start healing. \n\n(I have gotten the support I needed, and I am okay now. Thank you.)", "This is probably the best solution", "Your childhood must have been horrific.

I'm a realist..", "Well the 16yr old can go for an emancipation..", "And not a relevant one, and if you'd actually been in the military you'd know that.", "Lol ok sure", "Honestly that would probably be the smartest choice. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s a small child anymore", "Her actual actions say otherwise..\n\nMy own colleague some years passed, her daughter pushed for that at 16 and she got what she wanted.. 7 years later she's trying to rebuild bridges with her mom, her mom currently backpacking the world, has absolutely no interest.. mentally she's not there for it..", "Do you honestly believe two more years will make a difference?
