This is complex and I don't think you're an ah. Good on you for keeping Amy safe at gout house. There needs to be some compromise on all sides though. Amy's grandmother is ill and that is likely stressing everyone. Lily is a bit obnoxious and needs a discuss about respecting  her sister's privacy and her stuff...it seems that she's understand that she messed up, bur probably needs to talk with someone. Your BIL seems a bit unreasonable in the way he's handling this, but he's under significant stress and he's not entirely wrong. Amy is being overly sensitive to her sister going through her stuff. She will need to face going home, probably within a day or 2. She needs to talk to her parents and her sister about how she's feeling. Your sister needs to facilitate a conversation to mediate all of this; but might be a little overwhelmed with her ill MIL, stressed husband, and fighting kids. You're not a bad person for giving Amy a place, but keeping her when her parents want her to return home isn't your place either. Everyone needs to compromise and discuss all that's going on. You don't get to determine the time frame though, your getting involved is likely exacerbate drama between your BIL and niece. Get your sister over and let her start the discussion with Amy.", "NTA,\n\nBut what I will say..

All the yelling, screaming and threatening, not to mention trying to forcibly remove his 16yo kid and refusing to leave until you threaten to call the police.\n\nTbh that's all concerning. \n\nYou're not wrong to give your niece a break, your niece isn't wrong to be frustrated and utterly done with her sister, your brother and sil aren't wrong to have had to take in the mother who is injured. \n\nThe 11 yo is kind of a dick, the parents are kinda assholes for not pulling the younger sister up more. \n\nHave you sat down and asked your niece what her plans are?

I grew up in a similar situation.  I was the young sibling.  You are enabling the sister to run away. You should back away from the situation and let the parents deal with the siblings.  You are only making it harder for the parents to have the older sibling listen and be respectful.", "Sounds like Lily takes after Dad, who doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. Amy isn\u2019t complaining about sharing a room; she\u2019s complaining about her sister\u2019s snooping and stealing. Your sister seems to understand the problems and is trying to protect Amy by letting her stay with you. The reality is that Amy only has two more years before she can decide her own fate and Dad needs to smarten up. Some counselling is in order. NTA for giving Amy a safe space.", "NTA. Someone needs to get through to the father that if he pushes too hard he will lose any future relationship with her.\n\nWhen children become teens, the authoritarian style causes more harm than good. He needs to start to treating his daughter like the young adult she is becoming - listen, respect and discuss options.", " NTA\n\nAll you're doing is giving your niece a safe space to be while she works out her upsets and differences with her parents.\n\nMom and Dad are nowhere near on the same page. Give your niece some time to take a break from them.  Doesn't matter what Dads childhood looked like. His daughter isn't living his childhood so that's not a reflection of her experience.  Sharing a room has been hard on her.  She needs space.  She is taking space with her aunt nearby.  Why is this so problematic to Dad?", "I wonder if Lily\u2019s tears were real.\n\nShe might have just been crying crocodile tears to try and get her way, or her delightful father might have threatened her into it.\n\nWhile Lily is the GC, I bet he\u2019s awfully embarrassed that Amy won\u2019t come home. But not enough to ask her what\u2019s wrong and try and find a solution or even a compromise.", "NTA. Seems like Lily is the golden child. Good thing Amy had a safe place to go and it was very good of you to take her in. Lily is a brat. Seems like the real problem here is Dan. he probably bulldozed his way through Sue to go to your house.", "Are you in the US? If so, what state?\n\nAt 16 many \"children\" can become \"emancipated minors\" if their living situations are not good. You're not kidnapping her, but her home life right now is not acceptable. \n\nLily is obviously spoiled, but Amy shouldn't sacrifice her privacy for that. You may want to contact your local social services agencies to see what kind of action you should take moving forward. Because Amy is two years from being an \"adult\", her wishes will be taken into consideration.", "Any advice on how to do that? I feel like I just keep making it worse. Last time my bil came over I really tried to mediate but it just ended with him and my niece screaming at each other through a closed door. I\u2019m mostly sure he was bluffing about calling the police? My sister seems to have zero interest in making her come back right now. I think you\u2019re right and she\u2019s stressed. I was hoping maybe things would go back to normal on their own if my niece just stays here a couple days until everyone\u2019s calmed down but everyone\u2019s just getting angrier and I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m inadvertently causing that", "That\u2019s his argument.

At this point I\u2019m just not sure she will.", "I'm so sorry you never learned this lesson but when someone displays abusive behaviours you're meant to seperate yourself from them. \n\nNow I assume your counter argument will involve how high your threshold for counting behaviour as abuse is.", "Oh, I didn\u2019t threaten to call the police, he did. He tried to force his way into the bathroom but eventually gave up and left, but he basically said I was keeping his child from him and if I didn\u2019t send her back soon he\u2019d call the cops on me, which I\u2019m now worried he might. My sister says he was just frustrated.\n\nMy niece keeps evading the issue. She says if I want her to leave she\u2019ll leave but she\u2019ll ask to stay at a friend\u2019s house or something. She knows it\u2019s not a good long term solution but she says if she goes back home right now she\u2019ll go insane", "Id agree if there was evidence of abuse but this  is just sibling arguments and a teenager not wanting to listen", "I wonder what it\u2019s considered legally. Depends on the country I guess. Plus the mom seems to be on board", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being disrespectful at all but she\u2019s definitely not interested in working this out at the moment and in that I guess I am enabling her.

CPS will likely return her to her house.", "I\u2019ll keep that in mind for a worst case scenario. Taking those kinds of steps without trying other things first would feel like a betrayal against my sister but even she seems to see that everyone needs some space right now. I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to educate myself on this now so I can talk options with my niece", "Sounds like sis and bil didn't listen to their older child until this situation exploded. And bil puts more fuel to the fire. Maybe your niece can stay until grandma can return home.", "I think you can try talking to your niece first. Ask  your sister to come over when you do. Tell Amy you understand that it's tough right now and that what her sister did was hurtful. Mention that her sister is genuinely remorseful and while she's not obligated to immediately be back to normal, it's important to forgive when someone is genuine - not only for her sister, but for her sake. Tell her you understand that she's upset with her dad, but talk about how he may be stressed. Then ask if she's willing to have her mom facilitate a conversation. Tell her you're not going to kick her out, but that running away doesn't solve problems. Offer kindness and support, but let her know she will have to return home and address what's been going on.", "Keeping her from facing her family won't do her any good in the long run and will only prolong the issue.  She's going to need to work on it...if she refuses there's nothing you can do.", "That\u2019s not true.  She tried to work it out and Lily was being a brat.  When she tried to complain about it to her parents, they blew her off.  At 16, she doesn\u2019t yet have the skills to work this out because she has no authority over Lily.  She can\u2019t make Lily behave.  Your sister seems checked out.  And Dan just wants to bully his oldest in to complying with his demands.\n\nIt seems that Dan has absolutely no insight to teenage girls.  There is a big difference between teenage girls and teenage boys.  Boys don\u2019t care about sharing.  Girls do, especially when they have always had their own room.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Dan and Sue are doing nothing to show Amy how long she is going to be out of her room.  Is this 6 weeks? 8 weeks? 12 weeks?  When you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, it is a lot easier to suck it up and deal.  Amy at 16 needs some privacy, and her stuff needs to be respected.  How are Dan and sue recognizing Amy\u2019s needs??  They seem to only be focused on punishment and not finding a solution for everyone.\n\nI would suggest that you need to keep being Amy\u2019s safe haven, because you don\u2019t want her running away and falling prey to traffickers or whatever.  You should ask your sister over to discuss what I have said above.  Dan and Sue have less than 2 years before Amy is a legal adult and can just leave and never contact them again.  They need to start recognizing that if they don\u2019t start respecting her needs, they will lose her when she becomes an adult.", "Well,\n\nWhat about her going to college and getting a car and having funds.. are you going to fund all that?? \n\nBut you are enabling her to basically hide and not face up to reality", "Nothing was abusive..", "If you have written proof from your sister like a text saying she can stay you need to keep it. Make things easier if he does call the police", "NTA. I am happy your niece has someone safe. She is showing she trusts you. Coming from a home with two emotionally immature parents, in my opinion,  your niece is begging for help even though she is shutting down when you ask her questions. This isn't just running away. There seems to be a lot more going on that she doesn't feel safe to say, or she is assuming that she will be ignored. On the outside, everything looked fine when people looked at our family. Our family was not okay. She is sixteen, and she is clearly showing her needs are not being met, notndoes she feel heard. Promises of change is not the answer if they really do not change. Her father is showing you and her that he is not, himself,  able to cool off and be mature to work this issue(s) to work towards a resolution. The manipulation to you and your niece is not good with the anger, manipulation (with threats of authority), and physical abuse when he put his hands on her to remove her from your home.  That is just not excusable, and it is wrong. Gently talk to your niece and ask her if she feels safe at her home. She needs to be heard and sewn right now.  If he calls the police, be honest.  If you feel she is not safe, state it. Tell her you love her and she has your support.  Hopefully, she will open up  more. She definitely would benefit from talking to a therapist. I would encourage her to do that. You are not her Mom, but it doesn't mean you can't support her and make sure she is going to be okay as well as safe.", "Honestly the disrespect seems to be coming from the little sister and dad, not the older daughter. She's reached her limit in patience and was going to leave, period. What you've done is given her refuge, and now she can try and deal with it all from the safety of your home. Quite frankly, the dad is giving off authoritarian vibes, I mean it doesn't sound like even your sister is able to get him to be reasonable. The fact is, your niece is a young woman, not a child, but he doesn't seem to have any respect for her as such. It sucks you're in this position, but definitely NTA.", "Back out of the situation.

The elderly mother needing care, Lily being an obvious brat, and the father's complete and total lack of empathy or understanding. \n\nThey all need a break from each other. Sounds like the dad just expected everyone to fall into line, and he wasn't firm enough with Lily. Amy is at an age when she just cannot lose all her privacy and not be expected to react. \n\nAnd it is **not** betraying your sister to make sure your niece has a soft place to land. You're likely helping out the entire family with this. You're a great aunt. Keep up the good work.", "I feel like that would be the best solution. I\u2019m still hoping that my sister will smooth things over with her husband. Or let\u2019s my niece get some more of her things, otherwise this isn\u2019t going to work anyway once school starts again", "NTA   But it\u2019s a tricky situation to manage moving forward. You need to let Amy know this is not a permanent or long term solution & that the same would be true about her threat to stay at a friends house. That currently she\u2019s allowed to stay with you because her moms ok with it & if that changes she has to go back home. In light of her having to return home at some point, initiate a conversation about what she needs in order for moving home to feel manageable. Explain that both she & her parents will have to compromise & make an effort. \n\nI think you should look up resources for both individual & family counseling wherever you live. If those are hard to access a school guidance counselor or a teen crisis hotline could help short term. While you should keep helping how you can, Amy\u2019s dad is right that down the road she will continue to use you as a way out of directly addressing problems with her parents. You are not the best equipped person to teach her how to do that & she could use professional help. \n\nI agree with others that your BIL anger issues & sisters disengagement are worrisome. My guess is that dynamic is the real root of Amy\u2019s problems vs having to short term share a room with an annoying sibling.", "OP isn't keeping her from her family, she asked the mother if she was fine with it and she was. All of this unfolded with nothing to do with OP except it being in her house. OP is just a neutral third party in all this. OP is doing the right thing by not getting involved and not telling her sister and BIL how to parent their kids. If they can't work this out, the family should get some counseling.", "It will absolutely do her good in the long run.\n\n\nShe has space to get away from her shitty father until she's old enough to support her own ability to stay away from her shitty father.", "I agree and I've upvoted you but this\n\n>Boys don\u2019t care about sharing\n\nIs not true, I had 2 younger brothers and having to share did bother me. My son also at times hates sharing with his sister", "You\u2019re just an A H yourself with all your comments. OP is someone trying to look out for her niece and you\u2019re missing the bigger picture. \n\nShut up, Dan.", "God no, I hope this will be resolved in a week at most, I\u2019m just not sure how to go about it. While she\u2019s here I can at least try to talk to her, try to figure things out.

I asked what she thought would happen if she went home and she said for a week or so her mom and sister would be nice and her dad would best case scenario ignore her existence and afterwards everything would go back to normal. She says it\u2019s suffocating and she wishes she was 18 already", "Yeah, again, that\u2019s the worst case scenario. Best case scenario for me is everyone calms down and moves back when school starts again", "OP providing a shelter is great short term. Allowing the kid to stay when her parents want her home isn't fine, and letting her stay indefinitely isn't a solution.

I really empathize with her. It is a very lonely place to be at a young age. From what she said, it seems like there is emotional neglect and emotional immaturity in her home. She isn't crazy and she is 100% allowed to speak how she feels, and it is 100% valid. The behavior her Dad is showing her is stonewalling, and he sounds emotionally immature. Mom seems complicit and emotionally immature, which is not good at all.  Her sister is 11 and a child in the same household, so she isn't responsible for their parents' behavior. She still needs understanding and time to grow and mature, too. Morgan Pommels, a therapist, speaks about this.  Dr. Sherrie, another therpist, speaks on this. There is a book called Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, as well as others out you can read too. Just do a Google search. They have an online presence. Keep listening to understand and ask her what she needs. Sometimes, it may be something as simple as a hug and that you aren't judging here, even if she makes mistakes.  No one is perfect.

You called her parents to let them know where she was, which was *good.* They broke their word, coming over as a group when only Sue was supposed to show up - my guess is, Dan strong-armed his way into things, just like he's trying to strong-arm Amy into coming home. \n\nThing is, Amy is old enough to make this choice. \"My sister doesn't respect my privacy, so I'd like to live with my aunt, who does respect me,\" is a perfectly rational position to take. It's not like Amy tried to kick her grandmother out, or threw a tantrum about how unfair it is that she has to stay in her sister's room, or anything. She simply walked away from the situation and went somewhere safe and quiet, where she could cool down. That's actually good emotional management. (Something, it seems, that Dan needs to learn.) \n\nThis incident isn't about Amy having to share a room, or Amy resenting Grandma for using her room, or anything that Dan seems to think it's about. I don't even see any sign that Amy is trying to prevent her grandmother from being in her room, so I have no idea where Dan got that idea from. \n\nThis incident is about Lily deliberately violating Amy's privacy, and Dan steamrolling over Amy's perfectly reasonable feelings on that account. You're not keeping Amy from him; Amy is choosing to avoid someone who fundamentally does not treat her like a person. \n\nAnd I think you're right: If you forced Amy to go home, she'd just run away to someone else. She's said as much, and frankly, I believe her. Who knows where she'd go next? Or worse, if she'd manage to get there? If she has to sneak out at 2AM, and her next closest \"safe house\" is 5 miles away on foot... What could happen to her, as she's walking there in the middle of the night?", "You have the mother's consent for Amy to be there.  \n\nDan actually sounds kind of scary and out of control.

And you need to be sure that you're not violating any laws by \"interfering with custody.\" \n\nIt's really hard to have a grandparent move in and it's really hard to give up all of your privacy.

Any teenager would feel the same. That was a breach of privacy in the worst way and her parents should have come down hard on Lily for that. Also, as far as Lily acting\nlike she realizes she messed up and is sorry we cannot know if she is sincere, but it is at least as likely that she is putting on a show for her parents, and the way the parents came down in Amy about it almost assures that that is the pattern at the home.

We all get stressed but as a parent it is you JOB to show your children how to handle situations, not take out your stress on them. And I could even excuse the father losing his temper, it happens, but instead apologizing and explaining why he lashed out, he instead doubles down and continues to act very inappropriately.

(Amy is totally right to want and need that distance, I\u2019m not arguing against that, and OP is absolutely right to help provide a safe space for Amy!) I have four sisters, older and younger than me, and can absolutely see this behavior coming from a little sister who just wants to be close to her big sister (who understandably needs space).

Please, please, please protect her.", "Depending on where you live, even if the cops do get involved, they won\u2019t do much because of her age. 16 is old enough to \u201clegally runaway\u201d for lack of a better term. They\u2019ll come over, talk to the both of you, make sure she\u2019s in a safe place and try to talk her into voluntarily going home. If she doesn\u2019t want to, they won\u2019t force her, and they won\u2019t pursue charges against you. Especially if you have confirmation from her mother that she can stay. There\u2019s nothing illegal happening. They consider this a civil matter and will tell you as much. \n\nSource: I\u2019ve been on my own since I was 15. I also had an ex husband who refused to honor our custody arrangements and ACTUALLY kidnapped my daughter who was 8. Police wouldn\u2019t get involved. I had to go get her myself.", "So then you're in the clear if he calls the cops and lies to them. And honestly he's abusing and harassing you and your niece. He probably has regularly been verbally abusing her her whole life, he likely is verbally abusive to your sister. If he comes to your house yelling to be let in again, call the cops on him, what he is doing is harassment and it is illegal.", "I'm honestly not sure if she intentionally lied, or her controlling asshat of a husband just won't let her out of the house alone. Even if it means leaving his mother to her own devices.", "What would be worst scenario? Let her know she's safe with you and she can tell you. If worst scenario is what it may be- WORST scenario then take actions to protect her and seek justice for any abuse she may have been taking. Ensure she will NEVER feel unsafe due to her parents failure again.", "NTA.  Maybe offer to help your niece become an emancipated minor?   Once her father has no power over her everyone can negotiate from a position of equality for things like visitation and therapy. Of course the court would probably make you guardian so there is some responsibility there...", "The father keeps focusing on the wrong thing. By emphasizing sharing a room he\u2019s not acknowledging that Amy\u2019s life was turned upside down. Not just by losing her room, but Lily\u2019s repeated bad behavior. He should be saying that he understands and state how he will prevent repeat problems.", "I was talking about police. If he wasn't there and claimed she wouldn't let him see his daughter and he tried to get her back, she could get arrested. She also  didn't call the police so there is no evidence of that happening. Letting the daughter stay there does not give her the right to keep her away from the father. Not without a court order.", "Gotcha", "If Amy's mom said she can be there, it isn't kidnapping. Outside of a custody order, a child does not legally need both parents' permission to be somewhere.", "If that's your argument Dan should call the cops because Amy assaulted Lily", "I mean he\u2019s definitely TA, no argument here. I\u2019d need more information before I use words like abuse", "You are acting like a cruel person. Please don't be that.", "Say it with me: \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc Physical \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc intimidation \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc  is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc abuse.", "He physically tried to force her out of her aunts home after her mom voucher don her staying for a bit. He tried to force his way thru a bathroom door.", "I disagree about boys not wanting their own room etc- a younger brother is just as capable of being annoying and getting into / breaking big bros stuff", "But her *parents* don't want her home. Her mother thinks it's in her best interest to stay with her aunt until her dad cools off. That's pretty telling", "You make a really bad realist.", "She supports her as much as she can. Her finances don't need to take a hit, because scholarships exist. Student loans exist. Part time and full time jobs, as well as trades exist. Her niece can start on working on HER OEN options to make a future happen for herself. AUNTIE can support her any way she is able along the way.", "Are you kidding? Amy is NOT responsible for her little sisters repeated options. That has NOTHING to do with her not wanting it \"to work\". \n\nHer dropping her back into that situation would be BETRAYING her niece. She would be showing her she has NO ONE to turn to when she feels unsafe in a situation.", "Lol it doesn\u2019t work because the parents are enabling the brat little sister", "Did \"not getting her way\" mean her boundaries weren't being respected & she was supposed to suck it up & accept it?", "Sounds to me like you were the golden child and your older sibling wasnt and escaped an emotionally bad situation if they, as an adult, still havent reached out. Maybe tou need a second look at your childhood.", "An ex coworker of mines abusive ex took the kid, locked them in the car, held her hostage for money, and the cops just said oh well he's a parent too he has equal rights to her. That little girl has lived with her mom since she left that man, and her mom has a deep scar across her throat from him. One of the sweetest kids I've ever met. I hope that dude chokes.", "Yup. Lily knows that age difference between her and Amy means any altercation between them, albeit physical or just verbal, will result in Amy being the only one punished and is exploiting that. \n\nShe will push every possible button she can with Amy, break every boundary, ensure she always gets her way, take every one of her possessions she wants, and if Amy so much as takes her own things out of her hands you get, well, this exact situation. Amy being forced to apologize for standing up for herself while Lily fakes tears.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird bullying dynamic, but it\u2019s real.", "But that is not technically abuse. Nothing in here would be legally abuse, even if it gives reddit red flags. If the father calls the police, OP can get arrested. The court doesn't care about a teenager losing her bedroom or being around their annoying sister. Unless OP believes she is actually getting abused, which nothing here actually proves that, she could get arrested for kidnapping. \n\nShe may not like the situation, and yeah, the family dynamic is shitty, but OP is in the wrong. She can not keep a child from their parents, even if one parent says it's okay. This is a 2 yes, 1 no situation, unfortunately. The father threatened to call the cops. Op needs to give her back.", "OP isn\u2019t letting the father not see Amy. She let him in. Amy chose to lock herself in a room. That\u2019s her decision. In my state, cops would not arrest OP because she has permission from a parent. They would tell OP and the dad that this is a civil matter.", "OP is literally NOT keeping Amy away from her father. OP let the father into their home so that he could see Amy. *Amy* was the one who refused to see her father and locked herself in a separate room. OP isn't keeping BIL from anything or anyone.", "Her mom is actually just opting out, not necessarily making a decision. Mom should be talking to the dad.", "If you're asking about my sister, Not getting her way meant cussing my parents out because she had to do dishes.  Had to be home by a certain time (11 or midnight usually).   We had good parents.  She just got out on her head she didn't have to listen to them and then had a relative reminding her she had a place to stay if she wanted to leave.", "She got into drugs and my parents raised her kids for years when she went to prison.  This wasn't a no contact situation.  This was a she always lied and got caught situation then escaped to a family members house.\n\nShe was never not around she just get mad and left because it wasn't going her way.  Even as adults she's still the same.  I cut contract with her because the lies she spread about me and I was concerned with her being around my child.\n\nI've taken many looks at my childhood and my parents weren't perfect but the situation was made 100x worse by the relative enabling my oldest siblings behavior.", "Yep. When my ex kidnapped my daughter he hid her at a strangers apartment. My daughter waited until the middle of the night, found someone\u2019s phone and called me to let me know she had no idea where she was, didnt know anyone, and was terrified. I cried after receiving that call. I never felt so helpless in my entire life. The police did nothing. Shrugged and said they couldn\u2019t enforce custody orders as it was a civil matter. She told me her dad was having a birthday barbecue at his apartment and that she\u2019d be there. I dropped everything to drive the 2 hours. As soon as she saw me she ran towards me. He attacked me, ripping at my hair, punching me and yanking at my daughter\u2019s arm so hard she felt it pop. My now husband was there and pulled him off of me, and when the police showed up they arrested HIM (current husband) I took my daughter by ambulance to the hospital. The police questioned her and then looked at me and said \u201cI guess we arrested the wrong guy\u201d and shrugged. (My ex is white. My current is Hispanic). They did not release him even knowing that he wasn\u2019t the aggressor and I had to go bail him out. My daughter hasn\u2019t seen her father since. Her and I both told the courts that she was fearful of him and that I would not send her somewhere she didn\u2019t feel safe. I did end up with full custody, but the police did nothing but mess everything up", "My brother would do this because my mom always took his side and all it taught me was that I might get smacked regardless but she can't make me un-hit him for whatever awful thing he was doing to me so I might as well.", "With written permission from the mother that the daughter can stay there the police aren\u2019t going to get involved.", "You aren't very realistic about how abuse actually present itself in situations like this....", "Child: clearly gets verbally and emotionally abused\n\n\u201cIm a realist\u201d \n\nMhm! Bet you abused your kids or were abused but since you \u201cturned out fine\u201d (clearly not) you think shell be \u201cfine\u201d. Surviving abuse and then being a broken adult who refuses to face their traumas and abuses others isnt being a realist lol", "ok well that is a very different situation to the OP's. I didn't read anything that led me to believe that this was about Amy not pulling her weight.", "I would say these are two different scenarios though.", "This is the opposite of your situation. She\u2019s threatening to couch surf, auntie\u2019s providing a safe and stable location. Much better.", "But she doesn't have that, yet. She hasn't taken any steps to legally have the daughter.", "I was actually in the Military.. 23 years.. recently retired..", "Things spiral.  I don't think it's unreasonable to share a room with a sibling for a while so the dad can care for his mother with a broken leg.", "Police would no nothing in this situation. The girl is 16 years old, staying with a relative who has written messages from her mother that\u2019s she\u2019s good to be there. Even without that, police would call it a domestic matter and call it a day.", ">I do have texts of my sister saying I should let my niece stay with me until all this blows over, and promising to talk to my brother in law again to get him on board.", "It all becomes clear now", "That\u2019s obviously not the situation or issue at hand. Amy isn\u2019t leaving due to having to share a room, but due to her younger sibling constantly overstepping boundaries. It seems like you\u2019re being purposely obtuse and not at all objective here and decidedly subjective due to your past family issues which don\u2019t seem to apply here."]}
