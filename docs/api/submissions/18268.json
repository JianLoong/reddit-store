She is a minor under your care, living under your roof, and she needs to accept what you feel is best for the wellbeing of all your children. \n\nAnother angle to look at this from is that the younger two sharing a room could trigger a CPS investigation if the sleeping arrangement is mentioned to someone outside the family and it's reported. I doubt child services would support opposite sex tweens in a situation that deprives them of privacy for changing clothes, dealing with puberty, etc..

I shared a room with three sisters, and yes, it sucked, but it was not child abuse. My parents also had a three bedroom house and the biggest room went to the girls at that time because there were four of us and then my older brother and my second youngest brother.

Even if you didn't have any opinion about the boys sharing with the girls, go ahead and just ask her to share a room with her brother, and she's going to still be upset because that's not what she wants. She wants you to give her a room. So if favoritism is so bad then why does she deserve her own room? Because she wants her own room so she doesn't care that her own point would show favoritism towards some child no matter which one you choose.\n\nTell your child to stop projecting onto people and just say clearly what she wants. She wants her own room. And then after she says clearly what she wants to accept that sometimes the answer in life is no.\n\nYou can't afford a house that gives her her own room.

I understand that you have space issues, but your daughters are in very different stages of life and their relationship is likely going to suffer.

Everyone can voice their concerns. So, at least listen to your kids first. \nMaybe they also have some other ideas...\nMaybe for now, the younger ones are fine with sharing, and you revisit the topic every 2 years or so.

Yeah it sucks right now, but it is what it is. My mom was one of seven who grew up in an upper flat in Detroit with her parents and grandparents. The kids all slept sideways on one mattress for a long time. Culture has changed a lot, but it wasn\u2019t a terrible thing to be raised humbly, to grow up with consideration for others and camaraderie with your siblings and way less entitlement than kids nowadays. Your son is beginning puberty, he shouldn\u2019t be rooming with a girl right now. I witnessed my older sister go through puberty before me and it prepared me for it when I went through it.

I was the oldest daughter who had to downgrade from my own room to sharing when parents\u2019 finances decreased. Know what I did? I dealt with it. There were four of us, and we shared one room with two bunk beds in our first home until we were 12M, 10F (me), 5F, 4F. As soon as we got a bigger place, big bro got his own room and I shared with the littles. A few years later, we moved into a place where us two oldest got our own rooms, and the two youngest had to share. (We moved a lot\u2014public housing situation.) \n\nI must have been around 14 when we moved again and I had to go back to sharing with not just one little sister, but 2. 9 and 8 at the time. We got the biggest room, then parents, then bro (16). Big bro always got his own room; and I know our age divisions were different than OP\u2019s situation, since in our case the brother was the oldest. But it would have made no sense to have me sharing with him instead of with the two girls, even though our ages were closer. A few years later, he moved out and I got my own room. Then I moved out and the two youngest finally got their own rooms. Sometimes everyone just has to make sacrifices and be patient. Did I love sharing a room with two younger sisters when I was a budding teenager and they were still little girls? No, but I dealt with it. (And if masturbation is really such a big concern, use the damn bathroom. I certainly figured it out for myself.)\n\nAll of the kids\u2019 privacy is important, and as others have suggested, definitely find a way to alter the room or make partitions if possible. We didn\u2019t have the freedom to do that because we lived in city-owned apartments.

We moved when my son was about 10, that's when they no longer shared rooms. Given the age gaps between them, they all have a very tight bond and always have.

There's a lot more than being naked.", "Big sister is going to be in for a rude awakening if the dormitories are her first experience with sharing a room.", "The days of kids moving out at 18 , I think are over. Unless they are joining the service or job corps that will house them, how will they afford it?", "As teenagers? Yeah, that's weird and gross", "I can understand when there is extremely limited space that the adults might create alternative sleeping arrangements for themselves, but two girls of the same sex, just a few years apart in age sharing a room is a perfectly normal and healthy environment.\n\nThe idea that the 15F\u2019s needs should trump everyone else\u2019s in the entire house is so silly.", "That\u2019s so fucked up.", "that's an individualist and 1st world view. There are plenty of cultures where space is shared. Also, unless you can afford it, that's not always a possibility.", "I mean I agree, I\u2019m lucky enough to only sharing with my brother when we were younger and then J eventually took over the smaller guest bedroom and my brother kept the larger bedroom. So while I can resonate with the older daughter, I also know that it\u2019s not like OP is keeping a fully prepped bedroom on standby and refusing her daughters from using it. I think it\u2019s just a normal reality and a situation where not everyone is happy. I just happen to understand why the older daughter would say \u201cfavoritism for the brother\u201d.", "Shared a room until I was 16 years old with my older sister and reading these comments is making me be like wow how did we manage? Well, half these issues were super easily solvable.", "That\u2019s not fair, plenty of people have experiences where something did happen with a sibling.", "As someone who grew up with lots of siblings - I think these commenters are being deliberately obtuse.\n\nYes, it WAS and STILL is 1000 times easier to discuss/share body or female issues with my sisters or change near them (and I\u2019m close to my brothers).\n\nSharing with my sisters definitely resulted in some arguments as well as great times - but sharing with my brothers would have been so uncomfortable.\n\nOur bodies are different. Our experiences are different. If you can\u2019t recognize that, then you probably forgot what it\u2019s like to be a pre-teen.", "Sure it sucks but its not fucked up not every family can afford to have a room for every person in their family. Sucks to not have privacy, but you know what happens to the people that have to go through struggles they learn to cope, the people that don't well they whine about it on the internet.", "This should be its own (top) comment for all the truth it holds.", "My parents did that when both my sister and I grew to an age when splitting us up was necessary. The fact that it didn\u2019t cross your mind just says you value your own comfort over your children\u2019s.", "In my house, the largest bedroom is about 2sqft bigger than the next largest bedroom. It's the same floor plan for the entire neighborhood. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's not like some mansion where the master is the size of an apartment with a separate bathroom and walk in closets or some luxury nonsense. \n\nIn fact, now that I think of it, every house we had growing up was the same. The master wasn't noticeably bigger than any of the other bedrooms.", "This is a major point. Should OP show favoritism to the eldest child instead? One kid will get their own room. \n\n1st world nonsense that every child needs their own bedroom or else it's abuse and they should go NC. \ud83d\ude44", "...and over different rooms.\n\nAlso like.. I shared a room with my brother growing up until we had both hit puberty, I've seen him naked many-a-times even as we got older because we only had one bathroom and I not even once had a sexual thought about him. Ew. I may add.", "In many states, once young boys and girls reach a certain age, it's against the law because it's inappropriate. Boys and girls aren't allowed to share a room together once they are both 5+ in my state. \n\nAs in, a 12 yr old sibling can share a room with sibling of opposite gender until they are 5, then MUST be in their own rooms BY LAW."]}
