We had a bunk bed instead of sharing a bed.. To be blunt, if you are not paying for the housing then you don't get to demand a private room.

She is a minor under your care, living under your roof, and she needs to accept what you feel is best for the wellbeing of all your children. \n\nAnother angle to look at this from is that the younger two sharing a room could trigger a CPS investigation if the sleeping arrangement is mentioned to someone outside the family and it's reported. I doubt child services would support opposite sex tweens in a situation that deprives them of privacy for changing clothes, dealing with puberty, etc..
