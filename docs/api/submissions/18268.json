My parents slept in the living room and my brother had a storage room for a bedroom in our situation. My sister and I were lucky to have a room instead of the fold out sofa bed my parent's used. We had a bunk bed instead of sharing a bed.. To be blunt, if you are not paying for the housing then you don't get to demand a private room.

It is what it is.", "NTA Your son and daughter shouldn't have been sharing a room in the first place. Now that the younger daughter is entering adolescence she needs more privacy from the opposite sex than a mere barrier would offer. Your eldest daughter does not have a right to her own room. She is a minor under your care, living under your roof, and she needs to accept what you feel is best for the wellbeing of all your children. \n\nAnother angle to look at this from is that the younger two sharing a room could trigger a CPS investigation if the sleeping arrangement is mentioned to someone outside the family and it's reported. I doubt child services would support opposite sex tweens in a situation that deprives them of privacy for changing clothes, dealing with puberty, etc..

With the family described the existence of an older sibling would mean 3 bedrooms, when without the older sibling you\u2019d change from 2 to 3 bedrooms, if you were waiting to be homed, you don\u2019t get an upgrade if you have a home. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading research into the affects of this on teenage children and it\u2019s not good, 16 and 8 at least probably doesn\u2019t mean broken nights, but potentially creates issues finding a quiet location to do home work, it\u2019s far worse when sharing is causing broken nights and home work difficulties.", "yes and it makes one wonder as to why the op even bothered posting and asking lol", "Give one of the kids your bedroom and problem solved, all kids have their own rooms. You can sleep in the living room.", "You at least can't smell when they do. I can definitely smell when a guy has came in the same room as me, as I found out in horror at a sleepover when that age.", "Not everyone can just buy a new house. Having to share a room with a sibling of the same sex is not a tragedy. In many parts of the world and times in history entire families all slept in one room. This is a privileged,  first world problem.\n\nThe older daughter has been enjoying total privacy. In a few years she will be out of the house. The two younger siblings need their own privacy from the opposite while they are going through adolescence. It is inappropriate for them to share a room.", "Do people know women can have wet dreams as well?", "Sure, but question is amitheassole and they absolutely are for creating lives they can\u2019t provide equally for.", "As many as you can appropriately afford by yourself or with a partner.", "None.", "Excuse me?  Where do you live ?  It is absolutely a \"thing\"!", "Can you post links to that research please? I'd like to read up on it but I don't know what to search for", "*usually* can't smell", "Maybe the fact that there\u2019s so much confusion between the bodily functions men and women have highlights op\u2019s point of not making her two youngest share a room. Neither of them would understand what\u2019s going on with the other.", "Looking forward to your campaign", "lol..yta", "Uhm I live the US. Where plenty of opposite gendered siblings share a room. That is a rule specifically for fostering children. Not a federal law.\n\nEdit; fixed wording\n\nEdit to add info; you might find something on a state level. Through doing the research (since I've noticed you haven't posted any links) in Montana for example there is an age cap for it. But even then still legal up until a certain point.", "More of a general health issue. \n\nThan cum being like the most distinct smell in the world that only ever occurs when someone's came. Guy stank is definitely a lot more obvious to walk in on than any feminine odour lol. \n\nI dont know if you should split rooms based on cum lmao. But simply believe it's highly noticeable when a dudes been jacking it compared to a gal.", "Looking forward to the day y\u2019all learn to pull out", "To prove your point quite a bit: it also only depends on what kind of housing you\u2019re in if it\u2019s not a foster care situation. If you\u2019re in Section 8 housing, the rule for separation by gender happens at age 5, but there\u2019s also a maximum number of heads per room allowed. If you own it or rent through non-Section 8 landlords, brother and sister can share a room up until they move out. There might be restrictions on how many heads to a bedroom though with renting.\n\nAs you stated: it\u2019s not a federal law to have brothers and sisters in opposite rooms. The rule applies only to specific situations.", "\ud83d\ude4c"]}
