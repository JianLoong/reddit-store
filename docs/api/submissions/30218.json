I'd appreciate it if you stop power-tripping just because you're a so-called Judge.\"\"\n\nMight want to leave the \"so-called\" out of the statement since he is in fact, a judge.", ">\"Well, as you like then, I can only trust she's made the right choice\"\n\nI think he likes you. Or at least respects the fact that you stood up to him politely. He's probably used to previous boyfriends being intimidated by him. Your girlfriend is probably also not used to seeing someone stand up to her powerful father.\n\nEither that or he hates you and you need to drive the speed limit and double check your tax returns from now on.", "> it just went on and on\n\nINFO: What specific questions did he ask? The questions about where you're studying don't sound out of line to me; just normal questions to learn a little something about you. Were you perhaps already feeling intimidated by the fact that your girlfriend's father is a Judge (not a \"so-called Judge\", BTW). I do think saying not to expect special favors was out of line, though, and he sounds a bit over-protective of his daughter re: asking what your intentions were. \n\nA couple cardinal rules of life are never to cross a Judge (girlfriend's father or not) and try to make a good impression the first time you meet your partner's parents. I hope this interaction doesn't put you in a bad light moving forward.", "INFO.\n\nIt's absolutely impossible to say, if you were actually being grilled or this was but a perception of yours. Being asked questions, such as what you do for a living or what education you pursue are not necessarily aggressive, they can be out of curiousity, after all you came to their home. The remark about special favors has more of an aggressive connotation, unless it was said jokingy. Your girlfriend did not pick up on the aggressive vibe, which also begs the question if there was one. Maybe her father was indeed intrusive with his questions, maybe you went into the whole thing with a defensive mindset and your perception misleads you. Maybe he was testing your self-control or whether or not you can stand up for yourself. Maybe he was just being humorous. Maybe.\n\nThere is no way of knowing what exactly happened there, without having attended in my opinion. From my experience, it is very unwise to get off on the wrong foot with a partner's parents, if you intend to date that person for as long as they would have you. Sometimes it is inevitable though.", "NTA...now he knows you're not kissing up and looking for favours. He'll likely respect you more now.", "NAH. It sounds like your clear words made your girlfriend's father realize that he stepped over the line. They definitely had the intended effect of making him stop his obnoxious behavior. And neither he nor your girlfriend seem to hold anything you said against you, so there's no harm done. \n\nYou're overthinking it. Standing up for yourself was the right move, well done!", "NTA. He probably wanted to see if you have a backbone.", "NTA\n\nShowed the judge you respect him but will not tolerate bs. \n\nAnd he accepted it.\n\nGF still pissed??", "NTA this grilling by parents is so cringe.", "I think you scored some points with the judge!!@ way to go!", "Info: is it possible he was just trying to get to know you by asking basic questions like where you study, perhaps about your family, that sort of thing?", "Were you rude? Yup. \nHis situation gave him power than others probably tried to exploit for their own gain. Going through his daughter wouldn\u2019t be the scummiest thing he had to judge. He spent most of his time trying to get informations in order to assess judgment. That play a part in wanting answers from you. Also it might be considered as normal talk to get to know each other as you are dating his child. \n\n However he respect his daughter enough to not engage in your poor choice of words (probably as he understood in a way your discomfort), and clearly stated he was to thrust his daughter judgment on you.", "You definitely went overboard.. he has class otherwise your butt would have been thrown out the door. \n\nSounds as if he was just trying to know you. Saying he was power tripping and then saying he\u2019s a so called judge was disrespectful. That may just be way he talks being a judge. You downplayed his profession and hard work to become a judge. \n\nHe\u2019s a judge in highest court where you live so he deserved respect in his own home and as her parent. \n\nAsking about school and your life isn\u2019t grilling you. He was being a dad. You sure wouldn\u2019t have wanted to meet my dad.. dude you owe him and his daughter an apology. You sounded very arrogant and so disrespectful. Don\u2019t expect to be dating her longterm. \n\nIf he were my dad you would still be in the doghouse.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  How dare a man ask questions to another man about his intentions with his daughter.  I mean this is unheard of!  I mean the balls on this guy.", "Nta\nYou merely passed his test. \n\nHe wanted to see if you were a strong enough individual for his daughter to be able to hold your own with him or someone who is intimated by others.", "NTA.\n\n\nHis response makes it clear that he acknowledges that he was grilling you.\nPeople who _weren't_ doing the thing you're asking them to stop don't respond with \"okay\", they'll deny doing the thing.", "So the father of the girl you are dating wanted to get to know you, and you decided that the best course of action was to be an AH. Well played.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is just irritated, bc she is used to his way of talking. But i think you are fine with \"the judge\" ;)\n\nHe knows that you were right (but is most likely so used to the way of talking that he can't go out of his skin) but more important, you felt unfair treated and stood up for yourself. This means you know fair from unfair, so you will most likely not treat his daughter bad if you are a decent guy (what he just can hope for till he knows you better, like he stated). Also you will not accept unfair treatment towards you (and in extand also towards your gf) from others. I don't know your gf, but if she is more of a people pleaser, than he is more than happy to know you will stand up for her till she learnt how to do it herself. \n\nThe worst you could have done is getting defensive, but you didn't and talked to him eye to eye in a respectful way (ok, the \"so called\" was unnecessary, but he was obviously willing to let this slide).", "Uh, wtf, ya, he is her dad and is sizing you up.\n\nYTA, frankly asking about your studies, your opinions on issues sounds like normal dad type conversation.  He started slipping into everyone sucks when he dips into \"don't expect favors\" but chances are your attitude was so off putting when he was \"sizing you up\" that it may have been warranted.\n\nLook you are right you are dating his adult daughter and he is right he has to assume she is making a right choice, but don't you think keeping her family in a neutral spot, if not liking you, bodes well for your future? Jeez.", "NTA", "YTA", "NTA. Actually I think you made the right move. He was expecting fear but you stood your ground. His answer suggests an air of respect and slight annoyance, both of which are fine", "Nta, this stuff really gets out of hand at times and can come off as offensive as well, I had an exp with one of my exs fathers constantly trying ti drop subtle threats; \u201cif she\u2019s not home by 9 you might go missing\u201d, the last straw was when he told me \u201cif you ever hurt her I\u2019ll put in your whole family in a wheelchair\u201d I snapped and said I\u2019d love to see him try that and I\u2019m more than ready to have a go at it right now.", "YTA. It's not rude to set a boundary (to be fair, it didn't seem like he was trying to make you comfortable), but it is to insult someone in the process. Accusing him of powering tripping because he's a so called judge was super insulting. It sounds like you are intimidated by her family. If your girlfriend is family oriented, you may consider sucking it up and apologizing to the father.", "YTA, you don\u2019t need to be rude about it. The only thing he said that was harsh was for to not expect any favors. And you could\u2019ve put him in his place for that nicely and respectfully, leave out the \u2018power tripping\u2019 and \u2018so called judge\u2019 out.  \nHe\u2019s asking normal questions that a father normally asks. The \u2018why do you want to date my daughter\u2019 is a legitimate question. He wants to know what you like about her. What are you studying? Wants to make sure you have goals and not a bum. Parents asking questions is apart of them being a parent and caring for their children.", "You sure there was not any miscommunication involved? \n\nNTA, but you just put your gf in a very tied spot between you and her father. Might be that this was the beginning of the end. Also, I guess the relationship to her dad is now forever ruined.", "NTA.     \nI think he asks a lot of questions to make sure you are not just using his daughter. You made the right move to say you don\u2019t want to answer anymore questions.", "The \"so-called\" was unnecessary and may caused you to lose the higher ground. He may have been sizing you up, but being a judge of the highest court... I doubt that. If OP and his GF don't have a solid relationship, i don't see them together much longer.\nNTA for standing up to him.", "You failed the test.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
