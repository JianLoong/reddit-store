I was very much like Sarah in very specific ways.\n\nI don't feel comfortable making a ruling. I can understand some of her behavior but not all. I can understand the impetus to cancel her tuition but I'm not sure I can understand the action, at least without warning.\n\nTaking it back sounds more like a transactional friendship than a true one. But, you were also upset and I get why you felt used, plus things may have been left out, so I'm not saying that IS it.\n\nI wonder if Sarah plans to go back to school right now. Or ever. I don't know Sarah or her life beyond this, but she could feel totally at sea and may not want to have the tough conversation with you about her potentially dropping out.\n\nThat said...I don't understand her not letting you know when and where the funeral was. I can kind of parse through everything else, but that was weird. And add to that the passive aggressive social media post (super immature and attention seeking...), she may not be someone you want to continue a friendship with.\n\nThat may seem harsh, and it's not something to do lightly. About a year ago, I had to cut off a lifelong friend because they were draining me so much that that relationship became the focus of my meetings with my therapist.

She didn't have as much invested with these friends than she had with you.   It was her way of not having to face the reality that she no longer had a mother.  Possibly she had shame because she knew she could never return the kindness you and yours had so graciously given.   She felt less than-  because she couldn't return the kindness you'd given so lovingly.   She's suffering, she's lost and no clue how to appreciate the kindness of you and yours.     Maybe she simply doesn't know how to process the death of her mother.    Hopefully you told no one that you were helping Sarah financially because she feels embarrassed and somewhat humiliated.   Sarah doesn't understand why you are friends with her.    Never wanting your friendship darkened if she doesn't measure up to your standards.

However, calling and texting constantly is extremely overwhelming and way too much especially for someone going through grieving. If you care as much as you say you do, then do what will help her feel better, not what makes you feel better, and punishing her for needing some alone time while grieving is crazy.

Sarah is not handling her grief well at all and is taking it out on you. That\u2019s wrong. But she *is* grieving.

She is probably trying to distract herself from her sadness and that her life will never be the same. She likely wants things to be her \u201cnormal\u201d. I\u2019ve dealt with loss, and it can be a burden to have to respond to every call/text received from people with the kindest of intentions. It\u2019s also a burden to notify everyone about funeral arrangements. I only actually called older people who were unlikely to see an online post. Sarah does not owe anyone access to her grief or her healing process, and that doesn\u2019t make her a bad friend. It just may mean that, while you sound thoughtful and full of good intentions, your presence may not bring her the comfort she needs right now for whatever reason.

Money doesn't grow on trees and OP and her family would be better of focusing on themselves than some ungrateful girl who doesn't even consider OP a friend.", "INFO: if you payed for half of the funeral service how did you not know when the funeral was? People grieving usually don't send out public invitations for funerals, especially when they're young.", "ESH.\n\nI think all of the commenters rushing to say N T A are ignoring 2 factors:\n1. The tuition was a gift. Gifts shouldn\u2019t be conditional. When you gift someone something it belongs to them. It\u2019s cruel and unfair to take that back, and indicates to me that the gift wasn\u2019t entirely selfless in the first place. If your mom had bought Sarah a laptop to help with her studies, would you be breaking into her house to steal it back from her?\n2. Your first paragraph shows an extremely unhealthy level of emotional and financial enmeshment with this girl. This goes well beyond what\u2019s considered normal or reasonable for a friendship (and not even an especially long one: 4 years in your late teens and early 20s is a fairly typical lifespan for a friendship). You essentially created a relationship of dependence with Sarah that made an equal friendship basically impossible.\n\nObviously the way Sarah treated you in your moment of need is terrible. She was grieving, and I\u2019m sure didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to handle your grief, but that\u2019s an explanation not an excuse. She could have handled that a lot better.\n\nI can say with confidence though that this conflict began long before either of your losses, and that you\u2019ve just been oblivious to what\u2019s been brewing because the dynamic you created with Sarah via your \u201cgenerosity\u201d has made honesty next to impossible. The way you write about her in your first paragraph has so many little hints of pity and condescension. She lives with her parents? At 19 years old? What a tragedy! Clearly she needs your help! Likewise, the way you paint yourself as a total selfless angel in this story, constantly bending over backward to be the most perfect supportive friend in the universe, just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test to me.\n\nHere\u2019s what I suspect really happened here: Sarah has been resenting your pity and your \u201cgenerosity\u201d for some time. By paying for her tuition you put her in an incredibly difficult position, as it became impossible for her to be honest with you about how she was feeling for fear that any conflict would threaten her educational future. (You proved her correct in the end by finally punishing her with the hammer you\u2019ve been dangling over her head this entire time.)\n\nYour genuine friendship with this girl ended a long time ago. Since then she\u2019s essentially been in the uncomfortable position of having to play the role of rent-a-friend, forced to keep the mask up at risk of great loss to herself. When her mom died she probably decided she\u2019s finally had enough, or just didn\u2019t have the emotional energy to put on a nice face anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that this is the case when you look at how she left you out entirely from the news of her mom\u2019s death. This wasn\u2019t about her taking your support but being unable to return it. She didn\u2019t *want your support!* If she had she would have asked for it. If she had, she would have told you about her mom\u2019s death as soon as it happened. I think by this point she\u2019d realized that your \u201csupport\u201d always has strings attached. By this point she\u2019d gotten fed up with your transactional friendship and wanted nothing to do with you.\n\nPeople on this sub are so quick to take the poster completely at their word. But I read this post and I see so many \u201cmissing missing reasons.\u201d Read between the lines and it\u2019s clear that this version of the story is the tip of the iceberg, and that if we asked Sarah for her side of things she\u2019d have a LOT more to say.", "YTA.\n\nSarah was experiencing serious grief and you kept forcing yourself into her life at a moment when she may not have needed you specifically.  That makes it more about you than her.\n\nThen you take speaker phone calls (regardless of what they were) and bring your other personal business into her life at a time of grief.\n\nThen when your friend did die, you put that on Sarah as well.\n\nYou continually called and harassed her while she was processing her mother's death and planning her funeral.\n\nAt no point in this process did you act like a friend.\n\nSupporting her financially is very nice, but a friend who does that does not use that money as a transaction, and you seem to use your money as a bludgeon.

It may be that she is having some kind of major depression episode triggered by grief where she truly feels that no friendships are real. Seeing that your best friend died may simply reinforce this viewpoint she has of being completely alone in the world. \n\nNothing you do will change this bc, if it is a major depressive episode, her brain is not processing relationships like normal. When you see someone smile at you or offer something nice, you feel a positive reaction in your brain. When someone is experiencing major depression and detachment, they feel nothing when they see someone. They might even feel sadness and more pain. \n\nIt is like being sick with a fever and someone wants to hug you but your skin and body hurts. Normally, hugs are nice. But if you are truly sick with a bad fever, any type of human touch feels awful. Major depression can be very isolating because people lose interest in their relationships and do things to sabotage their friendships. \n\nYou are not an AH for not paying for her for anything.
