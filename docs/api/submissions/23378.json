I am always the friend who would take her out on friendship dates, parties, bought her birthday and Christmas gifts even gave her a spare key to my house for her to bring guys over and my mom paid for her last term of college, which I had no problems with as I understood her situation. Unfortunately sarah lost her mother to cancer recently and she didn\u2019t tell me I had to find out days later from her family member, the day I found out I rushed to her house with food and flowers to show my condolences and try to comfort her as any friend would. Later that same night I got a disturbing phone call my childhood best friend and business partner (let\u2019s call him josh) met in a serious car accident and was in the hospital  in critical condition. At the time I got the call the phone was on speaker and I was so shocked I broke down crying and Sarah just got up and went in her room. After I got my strength back I walked to her room telling her Josh met in a car accident and unfortunately I would have to leave and go to the hospital to see if there\u2019s anything I could offer to him or his family, Sarah said nothing. I thought to myself she\u2019s grieving right now so i understand. The next evening I went by Sarah\u2019s house to take her food and supplies as I know she probably haven\u2019t ate anything all day. I spent a few hours at her house trying to comfort her, because I know of her and her family financial issues my family and I paid half of her mother funeral services. I called and text her every hour that I wasn\u2019t able to make it to her house to try and comfort her in anyway possible and she didn\u2019t respond, so I thought because she\u2019s grieving. A week later Josh passed away. I was devastated, I went to my friend Sarah for comfort as Josh and Sarah were my only close friends. Sarah didn\u2019t pick up my calls so I texted her telling her Josh had passed away she viewed it and didn\u2019t reply, I followed up with letting her know I\u2019m coming by with food for her, she didn\u2019t reply or even open the door to let me in. A month passed and her and her family members posted on social media pictures at the funeral (I wasn\u2019t invited). I called her for the whole day and she didn\u2019t answer. She later posted on social media she has no friends and she doesn\u2019t want anyone calling her phone (I know the post was aimed towards me) the next day I called my mom we went to her school and canceled her tuition check that my mom paid for her next term. I know that\u2019s insensitive but AITA?.\n\nEdit. All of Sarah\u2019s other \u201cfriends\u201d were present at the funeral. My mom and I cancelled her tuition because we felt disrespected and used.

I was very much like Sarah in very specific ways.\n\nI don't feel comfortable making a ruling. I can understand some of her behavior but not all. I can understand the impetus to cancel her tuition but I'm not sure I can understand the action, at least without warning.\n\nTaking it back sounds more like a transactional friendship than a true one. But, you were also upset and I get why you felt used, plus things may have been left out, so I'm not saying that IS it.\n\nI wonder if Sarah plans to go back to school right now. Or ever. I don't know Sarah or her life beyond this, but she could feel totally at sea and may not want to have the tough conversation with you about her potentially dropping out.\n\nThat said...I don't understand her not letting you know when and where the funeral was. I can kind of parse through everything else, but that was weird. And add to that the passive aggressive social media post (super immature and attention seeking...), she may not be someone you want to continue a friendship with.\n\nThat may seem harsh, and it's not something to do lightly. About a year ago, I had to cut off a lifelong friend because they were draining me so much that that relationship became the focus of my meetings with my therapist. My therapist had to give me permission to let them figure things out on their own before I could do it. \n\nSo, here's your non-therapist permission, if that's what you need!\n\nThis whole thing blows.", "Hello \\~  Could it be possible that Sarah invited and hung out with the other friend group because it was easier for her to deal with the death of her mother?  She didn't have as much invested with these friends than she had with you.   It was her way of not having to face the reality that she no longer had a mother.  Possibly she had shame because she knew she could never return the kindness you and yours had so graciously given.   She felt less than-  because she couldn't return the kindness you'd given so lovingly.   She's suffering, she's lost and no clue how to appreciate the kindness of you and yours.     Maybe she simply doesn't know how to process the death of her mother.    Hopefully you told no one that you were helping Sarah financially because she feels embarrassed and somewhat humiliated.   Sarah doesn't understand why you are friends with her.    Never wanting your friendship darkened if she doesn't measure up to your standards.

However, calling and texting constantly is extremely overwhelming and way too much especially for someone going through grieving. If you care as much as you say you do, then do what will help her feel better, not what makes you feel better, and punishing her for needing some alone time while grieving is crazy. You don\u2019t have to pay her tuition either way, but not doing it over something you\u2019ve caused doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Yta. You sound emotionally draining and Sarah is probably at a point where she needs some space from you. Tbh, you sound narcissistic.

Sarah is not handling her grief well at all and is taking it out on you. That\u2019s wrong. But she *is* grieving. Even if you decide to walk away from the friendship - a reasonable choice - it\u2019s cruel and incredibly petty to take back a gift that had already been given, especially considering what she\u2019s going through. You know she\u2019s suffering and you chose to make it worse because you felt the emotionally distraught person was disrespectful.

She may resent you exposing her to more loss while she\u2019s trying to come to terms with her mother\u2019s. It\u2019s illogical, but these are the kind of thought patterns that can happen. There was a story on here where a family lost a daughter and the brother was making some dark tiktoks about her loss that the parents thought were callous and trivializing her death, but he was just a kid (around your age) trying to process real grief for the first time. The parents were ready to ship him off, but they sat down, had a conversation, and now the family is healing together.

And I\u2019m sure feeling \u201cdisrespected\u201d and having thousands of dollars and your education ripped out from under you while going through the worst time of your life are totally the same level of offense. \n\nMaybe she chose not to talk to you and only you because you are not the compassionate, supportive person you seem to think you are.", "Thank you for your comment.", "Thank you for your comment. As I replied to multiple comments above yours, Sarah was going out and having a good time with her other friends. At the time Josh passed away which was like two and a half weeks after her mother she was already going out and posting to social media, he met in the accident a week after her mother passed. Not saying that\u2019s a short time to grieve but I at least expected a reply back to my messages just checking if she ate or if she wanted something to eat.", "If it was too much then Sarah should have said something.", "If I wasn\u2019t that friend she wouldn\u2019t call me in the middle of the night to pick her up drunk or from some parties if she didn\u2019t have a ride or she wouldn\u2019t come to me for a shoulder to cry on when things weren\u2019t going her way or even popping up to my house randomly just to drink wine and talk. I was basically being used the whole friendship.", "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve already made your mind up and aren\u2019t looking for advice, or you\u2019re unwilling to admit that while you\u2019ve been financially generous, you haven\u2019t been emotionally generous. She is probably trying to distract herself from her sadness and that her life will never be the same. She likely wants things to be her \u201cnormal\u201d. I\u2019ve dealt with loss, and it can be a burden to have to respond to every call/text received from people with the kindest of intentions. It\u2019s also a burden to notify everyone about funeral arrangements. I only actually called older people who were unlikely to see an online post. Sarah does not owe anyone access to her grief or her healing process, and that doesn\u2019t make her a bad friend. It just may mean that, while you sound thoughtful and full of good intentions, your presence may not bring her the comfort she needs right now for whatever reason. It\u2019s absolutely your prerogative whether or not you want to discontinue this friendship, but I encourage you to talk to a counselor that specializes in grief to help you process both your grief and healthy ways to view Sarah\u2019s grief as well.", "None of that has anything to do with how you were or were not making her feel at the time of her mom\u2019s death. Whatever it was, logical or not, it made her feel worse to be around you, not better. \n\nThere\u2019s two possibilities here. 1) You\u2019re not the friend you think you are and do not support her emotionally, or 2) you *were* a great friend but she\u2019s going through some major shit and not making rationale decisions. So either you\u2019re an AH for making her grief all about you, or you\u2019re the AH for kicking her while she\u2019s down and reminding her that her friendship is a commodity you buy from her and you feel entitled to a refund. \n\nIt seems like you\u2019re suggesting she just used you for your family\u2019s money, but that doesn\u2019t make sense because she obviously still needed and expected the money; she isn\u2019t acting like someone who threw you away after she got what she wanted because she hadn\u2019t yet.", "Sarah has been down multiple times and reaches out to me to take her to the beach or just for drinks or even pops up to my house not wanting to talk but just to be around me and open a bottle of wine. I was grieving someone I considered my brother too but I wasn\u2019t taking that from her."]}
