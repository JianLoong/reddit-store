{"id": 9787, "submission_id": "110lliy", "title": "AITA for not getting up from a massage chair when someone wanted to use it?", "selftext": "I am currently 8 months pregnant, and because of that, I often get quite tired when I stand or walk for long periods of time. Yesterday afternoon, I was craving ice cream, so I drove to a nearby shopping center to visit my favorite ice cream shop. Unfortunately, the place was quite crowded, and all of the tables surrounding the shop, as well as some nearby sofas were taken. Because of that, after getting my ice cream, I decided to sit on one of two massage chairs that were close, and eat it there.\n\nOnce I started eating the snack, I got approached by a couple that was in their late teens, or perhaps early twenties. They asked me to get off the chair, since I wasn't getting a massage, and they wanted to receive such a service together, which I refused to do. In return, I offered to leave once I finished eating, or if they found me a different place to sit, since I could not stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and had a relatively large dessert that I wanted to finish.\n\nUpon hearing that, the girl was not happy. She told me to stop acting as if I was ill, that just because I was pregnant, the world did not revolve around me, and because I was not paying for a massage, I had no right to sit on the chair. She then asked her partner to get a security guard, and a few moments later, he came with such an employee.\n\nThe guard took my side, and asked the couple to either take turns using the second massage chair, or wait for me to finish eating, which upset the girl quite a bit. She accused me of being selfish and preventing the owner of the chairs from earning money, and left with her partner. \n\nUpon telling this story to my younger sister, she told me that I should have went to the ice cream stand when the shopping center was less crowded, if I wasn't able to eat while standing, however, my older sister believes that I had every right to sit on the massage chair if all the other spots were taken, and the couple was being unreasonable. Because of that, I'm not sure if I am the asshole in this situation.\n\nEdit: This really blew up, and now that I think about this situation, I can see that I am, indeed, in the wrong. Next time a similar situation happens, I will order the ice cream in an edible bowl, and eat it in my car, instead of taking up sitting spots that are owned by other businesses.", "created_utc": 1676224086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110lliy/aita_for_not_getting_up_from_a_massage_chair_when/", "score": 2917, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The massage chairs are a business. Someone installed those with the goal of making money from people paying to use the massage function.  Would you take your ice cream from one store and go sit at the tables of another restaurant and refuse to vacate when someone else wants to use that table to eat at that restaurant?

Those chairs are for earning money. You don't park in a diy car wash to get out of the sunlight. Go eat in your car or take it home.", "YTA, of course. I really sympathize with being enormous and pregnant in a crowded public place. But those were not convenience benches set up for mall patrons. They were essentially a  small business that you were blocking customers from. I personally would have kept walking to avoid a confrontation with someone who was knowingly blocking them, but I have severe anxiety, and the young women did not, so it makes sense that they confronted even if I wouldn't.  Getting security involved also makes sense, you were knowingly and willingly blocking a business and telling the customers that it was your right because you were pregnant. I know I sure as heck didn't want to hear this stuff when I was pregnant and dragging my severe anxiety butt out for some Auntie Anne's but hormones are horrible and after the baby you will look back and go \"Oh, yeah, that was all me lol.\" Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!", "YTA\n\nThose massage chairs aren't for eating.

But the proper way to get a seat in those circumstances is to ask\u2014politely\u2014if someone wouldn\u2019t mind scooting over or making room so you could sit down.

But unless I'm misunderstanding this, the massage chairs were neither seating provided by the ice cream shop, nor general-purpose seating provided by the mall. \n\nI think of it like this: say you want to shop at some business and its parking lot is full. That doesn't mean you're entitled to park in the lot of another private business next door, just because it's there, and currently unused, and convenient for you. It's simply not available for that use in the first place, and not up to you to decide otherwise.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t paying to sit on that massage chair. And the customers that were willing to pay weren\u2019t able to because you wouldn\u2019t move.", "I say YTA. I understand that standing for a long time is hard when pregnant, but the massage chairs a their for exactly what they are called: giving massages. So if you aren't receiving a service you shouldn't occupy them. Go to a less crowded time next time or get a container of ice when shopping.", "YTA. Either you pay for the massage chair while you're using it, or get out of it. Especially when others actually wanted to use it. Or go somewhere less crowded!", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you take your ice cream to go? The girl was right, you\u2019re pregnant-not sick or disabled.", "No respect for boundaries, sense of entitlement, refusal to see the business angle of the massage service being provided, you most definitely are an asshole OP. I am sure you will not think twice before playing your pregnancy card in any and all opportunities that can benefit you.", "YTA - you were sitting in a chair that someone has paid for it to be there to earn them an income. If your not paying for the massage you shouldn\u2019t be sitting in the chair at all.", "I\u2019m 6 months into my second pregnancy. YTA and entitled as all hell.", "YTA. the guard sided with you because he didn\u2019t want to be the guy kicking a pregnant woman out of a seat and risk a scene. those are not chairs to hang out on if someone else actually wants to buy their service.", "YTA - that\u2019s like saying I can park and pregnant mother parking just because I\u2019m tired after a hike.\n\nThose chairs have specific uses and are a business for somebody. You have no right to block them.", "YTA, \n\nIf you go to a beach, they have lounge chairs and umbrellas set up for those that wish to pay for it.   If you sit on one, someone will come up and tell you the cost.  You pay or get up.  If the beach is crowded and uncomfortable, would you sit there and refuse to move?  \n\nIt is irrelevant that they could take turns, because that is clearly not the experience they were willing to pay for and to pretend like it was, is disingenuous on your part.\n\nYou saw it was crowded before you got your ice cream, you should have ordered to go.  That teen couple did not get you pregnant and they should not have to cater to your pregnancy, at least when it comes to self serving choices you make.\n\nNote:  If this was a bus, transportation, or any other situation out of OPs control, the answer would be different.\n\nAs far as security guards, they don't get paid enough to put up with this crap, so he just went with the path of least resistance.", "YTA.

Yesterday afternoon, I was craving ice cream, so I drove to a nearby shopping center to visit my favorite ice cream shop. Unfortunately, the place was quite crowded, and all of the tables surrounding the shop, as well as some nearby sofas were taken. Because of that, after getting my ice cream, I decided to sit on one of two massage chairs that were close, and eat it there.\n\nOnce I started eating the snack, I got approached by a couple that was in their late teens, or perhaps early twenties. They asked me to get off the chair, since I wasn't getting a massage, and they wanted to receive such a service together, which I refused to do. In return, I offered to leave once I finished eating, or if they found me a different place to sit, since I could not stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and had a relatively large dessert that I wanted to finish.\n\nUpon hearing that, the girl was not happy. She told me to stop acting as if I was ill, that just because I was pregnant, the world did not revolve around me, and because I was not paying for a massage, I had no right to sit on the chair. She then asked her partner to get a security guard, and a few moments later, he came with such an employee.\n\nThe guard took my side, and asked the couple to either take turns using the second massage chair, or wait for me to finish eating, which upset the girl quite a bit. She accused me of being selfish and preventing the owner of the chairs from earning money, and left with her partner. \n\nUpon telling this story to my younger sister, she told me that I should have went to the ice cream stand when the shopping center was less crowded, if I wasn't able to eat while standing, however, my older sister believes that I had every right to sit on the massage chair if all the other spots were taken, and the couple was being unreasonable. Because of that, I'm not sure if I am the asshole in this situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's why public transit has priority seating for pregnant people along with disabled and elderly people. Choosing to get pregnant doesn't change that. And pregnancy is dangerous. It can quite literally kill people, and does often permanently disable them. I don't care how much you hate kids. You were one once. None of us got here without the help of someone who got pregnant.

Going into a store to look around and not buying anything isn't stealing. Neither is standing in the aisle to look at things when someone else wants to buy something in that aisle. It doesn't matter how annoying you find it. Calling it stealing is just asinine. That's the equivalent of what this lady did. She mildly inconvenienced someone. Calm down people. The owners of those massage chairs know people sit in them without paying. They account for that in their budgeting (or they go out of business fast). They aren't going to hail you a hero or share their wealth with you for defending them.

It is not, however, entitled to sit in an empty seat in a public space. To say that a tired pregnant person is entitled for sitting down is ridiculous. To side with people who are yelling at that pregnant person over a public seat (yes, this is a public seat as it's there for public use) is even more ridiculous.

We live in a society.\n\nEDIT: Also, you also did the right thing by offering to move if a seat somewhere else opened up, but they behaved impatiently and entitled. Additionally, the young couple could have assisted you by asking someone in a different seat to move so you could sit down, and everyone would have been happy.", "NTA and everyone else here needs to go outside, any reasonable and polite person would have politely waited to use the chairs while you finished eating, you weren\u2019t rude or obtuse about it and even the security guard agreed with you. if they\u2019re at the mall why don\u2019t they go look around while they wait, i can\u2019t believe the majority is saying you\u2019re the asshole, you\u2019re completely fine", "Wow most of these people here are psychos.

Yes it is true, a pregnancy is not an illness, but it is a burden, and a big one. I went through this four times. No free seat when you just cand stand upright any more is horror. Like you just ran a marathon and someone keeps you away from drinks, snacks and sofa. So if you see pregnant woman to occupy your seat for a little while, no matter where and when,, just tell her to take her time. Hi OP, do not let those people talk you into feeling guilty. You needed erst, with icecream or without, and I wild habe D\u00f6ner the same.  If I were this young couple I would have taken a little stroll around the shops and let you finish your icecream.

If the security guard said it was fine, which is BY EXTENSION the mall, then you are fine. It doesn't matter if the business put the chair there as the manufacturer still has to pay the mall fees to just have them there. That doesn't include the upkeep. In SOME contracts it does include using them for seating if no other such seats are available. They DO, however, turn on a \"feature\" that juts the back massager out if you DO use it as a seat to either get the person to use it or to hurry them along with what they are doing. The mall is LIABLE for DAMAGES if she were to fall, pass out, etc due to her inability to stand for long periods of time. That would have cost more than $1.50 for the massage. No one lost money from her sitting to eat her ice cream, people. IN FACT, she saved them tons of money for lawsuits and such. Unless your mall is \"in house\" security, the security officers have to go to a 60-100 hour course on safety, have a GuardCard, etc. They are actually MORE well versed in the laws AND better trained than most police officers. They sometimes even have to do MULTIPLE training courses out of pocket (if their employer doesn't pay per their contract) to be able to keep their certifications. Honestly, if we went private on our police force, we wouldn't have officers shooting for every little thing nor arresting people because \"they are the law\" while knowing nothing about the law.", "Yeah I don't think you're the A in this situation. Although I will say this. I'm also pregnant. Standing and doing things take a toll on me. That doesn't mean I gotta stop living my life. You wanted ice cream. Honestly they could have waited. I don't understand why a person would be like ok well hop to it I wanna use it. That's not how life works. I'm sure they found a couple of massage chairs elsewhere since they were so impatience. \n\nEverybody is talking about the business like they know exactly who owns them. Normally it's the mall, very very rarely is it an actual person. They put it there as a way to make extra money. But when your back hurts just from standing massage chairs can also make seats. Isn't that amazing?! Vending machines are independent contractors yes, but massage chairs not likely. \n\nYall really acting like 2 massages was gonna make or break a person; if a person did indeed own the chairs.

I disagree. \n\nI was recently pregnant and had too much relaxin and all my joints hurt and my hip even moved. I couldn't stand or walk for prolonged periods of time. I'm my country pregnant women in later months get a note from the doctor like they are sick or disabled.there is a reason why everyone says pregnant women and people with babies first.

But these chairs dont belong to some adorable mum and pops that'll go out of business. They probably belong to some giant mega corporation, maybe even the mall (like those little ride in things for kids?) Look honestly I'm not sure but no one was going to lose their livelihood because you sat on one of two massage chairs. There were two they could have taken turns if they were so worried about capitalism. The truth is that pregnancy is uncomfortable as hell and is a genuine risk to life, so it's not like you're not 'ill' really. There's a reason pregnant people are given priority seating with the elderly and people with disabilities on public transport. Anyway my point is capitalism doesn't come before people and you're a person risking your life to grow a whole arse human. If you needed to sit and it's not disrupting a real person's business I don't see the harm. \n\nEating in the car can be dangerous depending on where you are and time of year. In my country that's summer", "Soft ESH. I do think you're *slightly* in the wrong based on what others have said but tbh I think your infraction is very very minor - in my experience those massage chairs at the mall spend the vast majority of the day unoccupied and I can see where you're coming from if that was your only resort for seating. Ideally, you should have gotten up to let the couple use it because technically thats what they're for (or alternatively did you consider just paying to turn the chair on and use it yourself?)\n\nAll that being said, I think the couple are far and away the biggest AH's here. I can't imagine putting all that energy into harassing an 8 month old pregnant woman who's resting on her own over something so trivial. Calling the security guard over this is such an obscenely over the top reaction, I'm actually glad he took your side. It would have been so easy for them to walk away, go do something else for 5-10 minutes, and come back to use the massage chairs when they're unoccupied. I feel like this is an instance where if we're considering social rules/norms, the couple are technically in the right but they're still the biggest AH in my book for the way they handled things. At the end of the day, it's just not that deep.\n\nI'd be mindful of other responses to your post for the way in which this sub for whatever reason tends to react very strongly to situations involving pregnant women who inconvenience others. Sometimes these AH verdicts are warranted, but I do think there are times where people fail to have enough empathy for how much a physical toll being pregnant takes on your body and mind -- sometimes you just need a bit of kindness and grace from strangers when you're pregnant and in public.", "NTA lmao at stealing from the poor, poor massage chair owner.

If it were (because the late months of pregnancy can *absolutely* cause medical situations that necessitate sitting down), she would be NTA. But she interfered with a business, other customers of that business, and risked damaging those chairs if she spilled ice cream on them. Honestly, the choice to eat a sticky, prone to be messy food on electronic chairs might be the worst part of all of this.\n\n\nAs an aside though, I appreciate that the guard erred on the side of caution and didn't force a pregnant woman to move because 9 times out of 10 that's a bad thing to do.", "Well said and you explained it in a nicer way than I could have.

You know, a large box filled with seats only available to the keyholder. Why couldn't she sit there? I understand that pregnancy isn't easy and that it's hard to remain standing, but unless you plan to live in the mall for the rest of the pregnancy you're going to have to waddle back to the car at some point anyway. That point might as well be after purchasing the ice cream, but before eating it.  \n\n\nA lot of people are also confusing the concept of \"public seats\" and \"seats in public\". \"Public seats\" are available for anyone to use. \"Seats in public\" is just a phrase that explains where the seat is located, but says nothing about who can or cannot reasonably use it. In this case, the seats in question are *in* public, but they are *not* public. They are a place of business, and while I don't have an issue with people sitting on them when not in use, the seated persons should vacate the massage chairs when others wish to use them for their intended purpose.  \nLet's try an analogy. Imagine a sunny day in a parking lot. An open convertible is parked there. In it are five vacant seats that can easily be accessed from the parking lot. Does that mean they are available for anyone to use? The answer is \"of course not\", because we recognize that while the seats are in public, they are not public seats. Another example are seats at stadiums. They are seats in public, but are they public seating? Of course not, you can only reasonably expect to sit in the seat for which you have a ticket.", "Yet another woman who gets pregnant and feels like everyone and every business in the world should accommodate her every ridiculous and entitled desire", "I wonder how she's been acting during the rest of her pregnancy.
