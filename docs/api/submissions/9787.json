{"id": 9787, "submission_id": "110lliy", "title": "AITA for not getting up from a massage chair when someone wanted to use it?", "selftext": "I am currently 8 months pregnant, and because of that, I often get quite tired when I stand or walk for long periods of time. Yesterday afternoon, I was craving ice cream, so I drove to a nearby shopping center to visit my favorite ice cream shop. Unfortunately, the place was quite crowded, and all of the tables surrounding the shop, as well as some nearby sofas were taken. Because of that, after getting my ice cream, I decided to sit on one of two massage chairs that were close, and eat it there.\n\nOnce I started eating the snack, I got approached by a couple that was in their late teens, or perhaps early twenties. They asked me to get off the chair, since I wasn't getting a massage, and they wanted to receive such a service together, which I refused to do. In return, I offered to leave once I finished eating, or if they found me a different place to sit, since I could not stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and had a relatively large dessert that I wanted to finish.\n\nUpon hearing that, the girl was not happy. She told me to stop acting as if I was ill, that just because I was pregnant, the world did not revolve around me, and because I was not paying for a massage, I had no right to sit on the chair. She then asked her partner to get a security guard, and a few moments later, he came with such an employee.\n\nThe guard took my side, and asked the couple to either take turns using the second massage chair, or wait for me to finish eating, which upset the girl quite a bit. She accused me of being selfish and preventing the owner of the chairs from earning money, and left with her partner. \n\nUpon telling this story to my younger sister, she told me that I should have went to the ice cream stand when the shopping center was less crowded, if I wasn't able to eat while standing, however, my older sister believes that I had every right to sit on the massage chair if all the other spots were taken, and the couple was being unreasonable. Because of that, I'm not sure if I am the asshole in this situation.", "created_utc": 1676224086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110lliy/aita_for_not_getting_up_from_a_massage_chair_when/", "score": 407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The massage chairs are a business. Someone installed those with the goal of making money from people paying to use the massage function.  Would you take your ice cream from one store and go sit at the tables of another restaurant and refuse to vacate when someone else wants to use that table to eat at that restaurant?

I really sympathize with being enormous and pregnant in a crowded public place. But those were not convenience benches set up for mall patrons. They were essentially a  small business that you were blocking customers from. I personally would have kept walking to avoid a confrontation with someone who was knowingly blocking them, but I have severe anxiety, and the young women did not, so it makes sense that they confronted even if I wouldn't.  Getting security involved also makes sense, you were knowingly and willingly blocking a business and telling the customers that it was your right because you were pregnant. I know I sure as heck didn't want to hear this stuff when I was pregnant and dragging my severe anxiety butt out for some Auntie Anne's but hormones are horrible and after the baby you will look back and go \"Oh, yeah, that was all me lol.\" Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!", "YTA\n\nThose massage chairs aren't for eating.

YTA", "YTA, if that seating had a purpose and you weren't using it for its purpose knowing someone else *needed it for its intended purpose* you're *obviously* the asshole - would you have gone and sat in any other business, for instance a furniture shop, or a hairdressers, to eat?", "YTA\u2014look, I\u2019m sympathetic to third trimester pregnancy pains, as I had pretty bad sciatica during mine. But the proper way to get a seat in those circumstances is to ask\u2014politely\u2014if someone wouldn\u2019t mind scooting over or making room so you could sit down. Taking a massage chair from another business, not paying to use it, and not getting up when someone IS going to use it is incredibly rude.", "Gentle ESH\n\n> all of the tables surrounding the shop, as well as some nearby sofas were taken. \n\n> because I was not paying for a massage, I had no right to sit on the chair\n\nI am absolutely sympathetic to your situation. But unless I'm misunderstanding this, the massage chairs were neither seating provided by the ice cream shop, nor general-purpose seating provided by the mall. \n\nI think of it like this: say you want to shop at some business and its parking lot is full. That doesn't mean you're entitled to park in the lot of another private business next door, just because it's there, and currently unused, and convenient for you. It's simply not available for that use in the first place, and not up to you to decide otherwise.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t paying to sit on that massage chair. And the customers that were willing to pay weren\u2019t able to because you wouldn\u2019t move.", "I say YTA. I understand that standing for a long time is hard when pregnant, but the massage chairs a their for exactly what they are called: giving massages. So if you aren't receiving a service you shouldn't occupy them. Go to a less crowded time next time or get a container of ice when shopping.", "YTA. Either you pay for the massage chair while you're using it, or get out of it. Especially when others actually wanted to use it. Or go somewhere less crowded!", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you take your ice cream to go? The girl was right, you\u2019re pregnant-not sick or disabled.", "No respect for boundaries, sense of entitlement, refusal to see the business angle of the massage service being provided, you most definitely are an asshole OP. I am sure you will not think twice before playing your pregnancy card in any and all opportunities that can benefit you.", "YTA - you were sitting in a chair that someone has paid for it to be there to earn them an income. If your not paying for the massage you shouldn\u2019t be sitting in the chair at all.", "I\u2019m 6 months into my second pregnancy. YTA and entitled as all hell.", "YTA. the guard sided with you because he didn\u2019t want to be the guy kicking a pregnant woman out of a seat and risk a scene. those are not chairs to hang out on if someone else actually wants to buy their service.", "YTA - that\u2019s like saying I can park and pregnant mother parking just because I\u2019m tired after a hike.\n\nThose chairs have specific uses and are a business for somebody. You have no right to block them.", "YTA, \n\nIf you go to a beach, they have lounge chairs and umbrellas set up for those that wish to pay for it.   If you sit on one, someone will come up and tell you the cost.  You pay or get up.  If the beach is crowded and uncomfortable, would you sit there and refuse to move?  \n\nIt is irrelevant that they could take turns, because that is clearly not the experience they were willing to pay for and to pretend like it was, is disingenuous on your part.\n\nYou saw it was crowded before you got your ice cream, you should have ordered to go.  That teen couple did not get you pregnant and they should not have to cater to your pregnancy, at least when it comes to self serving choices you make.\n\nNote:  If this was a bus, transportation, or any other situation out of OPs control, the answer would be different.\n\nAs far as security guards, they don't get paid enough to put up with this crap, so he just went with the path of least resistance.", "YTA.

Yesterday afternoon, I was craving ice cream, so I drove to a nearby shopping center to visit my favorite ice cream shop. Unfortunately, the place was quite crowded, and all of the tables surrounding the shop, as well as some nearby sofas were taken. Because of that, after getting my ice cream, I decided to sit on one of two massage chairs that were close, and eat it there.\n\nOnce I started eating the snack, I got approached by a couple that was in their late teens, or perhaps early twenties. They asked me to get off the chair, since I wasn't getting a massage, and they wanted to receive such a service together, which I refused to do. In return, I offered to leave once I finished eating, or if they found me a different place to sit, since I could not stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and had a relatively large dessert that I wanted to finish.\n\nUpon hearing that, the girl was not happy. She told me to stop acting as if I was ill, that just because I was pregnant, the world did not revolve around me, and because I was not paying for a massage, I had no right to sit on the chair. She then asked her partner to get a security guard, and a few moments later, he came with such an employee.\n\nThe guard took my side, and asked the couple to either take turns using the second massage chair, or wait for me to finish eating, which upset the girl quite a bit. She accused me of being selfish and preventing the owner of the chairs from earning money, and left with her partner. \n\nUpon telling this story to my younger sister, she told me that I should have went to the ice cream stand when the shopping center was less crowded, if I wasn't able to eat while standing, however, my older sister believes that I had every right to sit on the massage chair if all the other spots were taken, and the couple was being unreasonable. Because of that, I'm not sure if I am the asshole in this situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You should have definitely moved to let them use it.", "The point is that they shouldn\u2019t have had to wait because you shouldn\u2019t have insisted on sitting there", "You're a thief. You stole 15 minutes of revenue from the chair owner. \n\nThere is only so much time in the day.  Yes, they could have waited.  And then if there was someone waiting after them?", "It was a massage chair and you weren\u2019t getting a massage.", "You being pregnant is not someone else\u2019s problem.", "Or you could have gotten up and found the bench next bench which would have taken all of 2 minutes of your life and not taken up a business' property that you are *supposed to pay to sit in* YTA. Stop making excuses and accept it.", "or you could have got up, and waited 15 minutes for the *paying customers* YTA", "They asked her to move so they could pay for the chair. She should've moved end of story.", "Pretty sure this is taking place at a mall of some nature and the ice cream shop and massage chairs are unrelated.", "She went to a shopping center. A place with many businesses.\n\nI sincerely doubt the ice cream shop in bay #73 is also the owner of the massage chairs in Hall #12 spot.\n\nWhen it comes to those chairs, OP was *not* a patron. The couple wanting to use the massage chairs were.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve understood the general consensus here.", "There was no where left to sit. That\u2019s the problem of the mall owner, not her. She needed to sit, so she sat. \n\nJesus wept. Some of y\u2019all need to go outside and touch grass", "Disagree but i understand its an unpopular opinion. I give special treatment to pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with a disability.", "Pretty sure the owner of a massage chair in the mall knows people are gonna sit on their chair and not pay for it. If it was inside a shop or there were paid staff, a different story. OP should've just stuffed a few coins in there and enjoyed a massage while eating dessert.", "Well someone owns the chairs and is not making money while someone is just sitting there.", "Yes. Pregnancy is NOT a disability. It does not entitle you to things. And honestly if I was the owner of the massage chairs, I would be pissed to see someone eating ice cream in them.", "I had a friend in high school who\u2019s mom yelled at me for 20 minutes straight (in public at a football game where NO ONE stepped in) for being a \u201cbad friend\u201d because I didn\u2019t congratulate her daughter for winning homecoming queen. When my cheer coach had to force her to call and apologize, she said \u201cwell I\u2019m a mama bear so I was doing my job.\u201d\n\nBeing a mom does not give you a pass to be hateful towards others. I totally agree with you, \u201cmama bear\u201d is the dumbest phrase ever.", "Wooooow such monetary loss. \n\nHonestly, if I was that lady, I woulda put a tenner in the chair and told everyone to fuck off.\n\nAlso, I love how everyone is all about her \"getting herself knocked up\".  What if she has planned a family? Pregnant women should be protected at all costs.", "I wonder how your mom feels about carrying and birthing you.", "I'm just LOLing at you, I said what I said. :)", "Yup.", "yea, still. people sit in the massage chairs at the mall all the time as a place to just sit? it is not the same at all.", "If the owners of the chairs cared enough about a dollar or 2, they wouldn't leave the chairs unmanned in the middle of mall walkways. Where people sit.\n\nIf there is not a sign that says \"Chairs for paying customers only\" then wait your turn.", "What flavor ice cream was it? I need to know this detail before I make my judgement", "YTA but you are a talented artist, I would like to see an illustration of this scene as it played out. Congrats on the baby.", "Youre pregnant. Im sorry they kicked up a fuss which made you ta. Because you could have been let off xx", "but why they NEEDED to get massages together? I get it's cool but they has no right o ask her to leave when one is available they could take turns", "They surely belong to some proprietor who invested funds in chairs that could produce revenue.", "This is a dumb take and you should feel bad for having it", "To be honest, I could have asked for an edible bowl, and will definitely do so next time if the place is crowded! I definitely made a mistake by not doing so.", "Like actual massage chair recliners? Most of the malls where I live are open air so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever noticed any near me. I was picturing those things you see at a county fair. Lol!", "Presumably they would be at the mall for awhile. People don't just come to a mall to sit in chairs then leave. They could have just waited patiently. Also, the intended purpose of a chair is to sit on it. The owners of the chairs aren't entitled to anyone's money any more than that couple was entitled to sit in them themselves.", "This is incorrect. You do not pay to sit there. You pay for the massage function. She didn\u2019t need the massage function, so it was just a seat. \n\nNo sign, no operator, no posted rules. Chairs in the middle of a mall are public use. There were massage chairs available, they just wanted hers. \n\nThe right solution was for the couple to wait their turn, or go someplace that specializes in couples massages.", "She didn't still anything. The owners of those chairs aren't entitled to money from anyone. 90% of the people who sit in those chairs don't pay for a massage and the owners know it. They account for that when they put those chairs in malls. The couple could have easily came back later.", "That\u2019s a little dramatic. She was being rude but that chair is almost definitely owned by the mall, not some small business owner counting the quarters for their rent.", "in what way was she imposing herself? they approached HER, not the other way around. people use the massage chairs in the mall as a place to sit literally ALL the time?", "Private property, maybe. But also public use. The private owner can absolutely place restrictions, but without them, the seats/parking spaces (depending on the anecdotes above) are for the public use. \n\nBut you know who does NOT have the right to decide for the private property owner what their rules are? Random other patrons who feel like kicking a pregnant woman out of her seat. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019d imagine if this post is true that the security guard would have suggested a different seat if one was available. Could be wrong though, I don\u2019t know much about mall security.", "Yes, because she\u2019s HEAVILY PREGNANT. Walking or standing for too long is downright painful when you\u2019re that pregnant. It\u2019s literally classified as a disability, and for good reason. If someone with a mobility problem was in this situation would you accuse them of being lazy?", "Have definitely seen them in shopping centers in England", "I\u2019m English, I live in England and see them all the time in different shopping centres here.", "First time I used one was in Hull\u2026", "Yeah I know what you\u2019re talking about, it was just clear from the way the post was written that this is not the case. \n\nThey would have complained to the masseuse, not a random security guard.", "And probably pays the mall rent to have the chairs there too.", "Are you missing the part where the shopping centre took her side? I agree that if the shopping centre had asked her to move and she didn't she would be the AH. But the guard took her side. A woman complained and her complaint was deemed invalid by the authorities. OP is NTA.", "But she is pregnant and the world should cater to her!", "Absolutely, I was referring to the \"guard and (I've cream shop) employee\" that commenter mentioned. I'll edit to be clearer.", "But he'd be overjoyed to see someone eating ice cream in them while also getting a wicked massage", "Yeah you would\u2019ve then been paying for the service which would\u2019ve been the proper thing to do in order to continue sitting there which she did not do", "Because you can't formulate a proper rebuttal, beyond \"mE PrEgNaNt, Me mOst ImPoRtAnT.\"", "And you\u2019re wrong. :)", "Paying customers get priority. How do you expect the owners to pay rent to the mall if people like OP keep paying customers from using them? It\u2019s not like a normal chair.", "People steal and cheat all the time. That doesn\u2019t make it ok.", "Sure but if someone walked up ready to put money down to get a massage, I\u2019d get up. We have them at the airport for my state. And yes, people just sit to be comfy. But the expectation is that you give up the chair if someone wants to use it for the intended purpose.", "It was passion fruit, lime and vanilla.", "Nope.", "I've never heard of an ice cream shop that doesn't have to go containers.", "That\u2019s not how businesses work. At all.", ">No sign, no operator, no posted rules. Chairs in the middle of a mall are public use. There were massage chairs available, they just wanted hers.   \n    \nWow, with all that information that isn\u2019t in the OP (or any comments), you must have been right there when this all went down!", "That\u2019s not the issue. However they were not intended for her purpose but for the purpose of the young couple. They asked to use it for its intended purpose. If there is no one around to use the massage function then by all means. However when a paying customer shows up it\u2019s up to her to move.", "I do. If it was a problem mall security would have found a different place for her to sit if one were available. If mall security didn't care then she wasn't doing anything wrong as far as the mall was concerned.", "Haha, good point!", "The Authorities never make mistakes! Lord knows the hour of training mall security guards go through should have prepared them for this scenario\u2026 \n\n/s", "A security guard really doesn\u2019t represent the shopping center. They are there to look like a dressed up authority figure, but they have such limits to any actions they can take. It\u2019s like asking a janitor a question and saying their answers represents the shopping centers policies. \n\nSource: years and years of retail at various shopping centers", "No because i don't care that you don't like my answer. Keep on scrolling, the fact you want to rant amuses me but doesn't make me feel any need to give you any time at all.", "Sure Boo lol", "I\u2019ve never heard of an ice-cream shop inside a mall provide glass bowls.", "Lol yeah bc mall security is an absolute guide post of morality.  No way he was just taking the option that was going to be the least amount of work.", "Well double down all you want, but based off the rest off comments you\u2019re very much in the minority. So also probably entitled as hell.", "I\u2019ve never heard of an ice-cream shop", "Lol \"double down\"? I'm not even responding in full sentences to you. I'm just letting you know i'm still laughing at you :) Don't you think you might be taking this a bit too seriously? Maybe get out and take a walk :) Anyway thanks for the giggles", "I've never heard of ice-cream. Or a shop.", "I\u2019ve never heard of ice cream?", "I\u2019ve never heard!"]}
