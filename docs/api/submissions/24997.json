To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\n- C.S. Lewis", "NTA - they\u2019re all fake friends !

My best mate and I wore one each, blasted the Jurassic Park theme, and ran into our fav cafe and high-fived (well as best as we could for a couple of t-rex dinos) the barista and ran out again.

Great movie!!", "Likely for at least some, though, I'm pretty sure I've seen at least one instance that cited Lewis.\n\nSadly, no matter which source they're using, people that use it to give grief to others about stuff like what OP is talking about are missing a key point. Those verses (which yes, Lewis is referencing) aren't talking about hobbies and entertainments.\n\nThey're talking about things like how you speak to others, or the thoughts and lines on reasoning that you use when figuring stuff out.\n\nThey're talking about emotional maturity, not how someone finds joy in the world. One can be very emotionally mature, and still find joy in a dino-themed party, or watching Bugs Bunny on a Saturday morning, or coloring in a coloring book.", "That's the difference between a 40 year old and a 25 year old. 25 year old men are only a few years adult and they feel as if they have to prove it.\n\nWhen you're 40, you basically don't have to prove shit to anyone.

The invitation was \"hey, you know how BF loves dinosaurs and can basically lip sync jurassic park? He wanted a dino party as a kid, so I'm throwing one for him now. It'll be silly.\" I don't think that's oversharing. \n\nHe also wasn't insecure about it before, he really loved it until he talked to some of his friends, so I don't think the invite was the problem.", "I have been told that if the idea of doing something makes me giggle for longer than ten minutes, I should assume I'm not allowed to do it.

The party was a hit until his friends decided to belittle the things he likes behind OP\u2019s back. NOW all of a sudden OP is at fault for not \u201cthrowing him a normal party?\u201d \n\nShe put in time and effort to do something thoughtful for her BF. She could have not thrown him a party at all. But she did, catered to things he\u2019s liked, hosted his friends, and somehow SHE\u2019s the asshole?\n\nMake it make sense, please.", "I never said it was OP\u2019s fault for throwing the party or that she was in the wrong for that. I distinctly said OP was NTA and the bf\u2019s reaction to his friends comments weren\u2019t justified. \n\nOP specifically asked if she should have known a dinosaur party was not age appropriate. The answer is yes, and on top of that, OP clearly *did know* it was not age appropriate. What also was not appropriate was her disclosing his childhood disappointment about never having had a dinosaur themed party as a kid instead of choosing to make it about his *current* interest in and fascination with dinosaur/archeology related things", "What are the ages that a dinosaur party are not appropriate? Because at 36 it\u2019s definitely appropriate again and fucking awesome.", "And how exactly should she have known a dinosaur party wasnt age appropriate? All she had to go on was that he didn\u2019t get a Dino-themed party as a kid, and that he\u2019s interested in archeological studies related to dinosaurs. This party has themes of BOTH if I read it correctly, including excavating tiny bottles of booze.\n\nAlso, one thing about being an \u201cadult\u201d is that you can ultimately choose to do things you couldn\u2019t do as a kid. Why get on people\u2019s case about what\u2019s \u201cchildish\u201d if these are things someone loves? I\u2019m almost 30, and if my SO decided to throw me a surprise Pokemon or Sailor Moon themed party around things I\u2019m interested in, I\u2019d be over the moon.\n\nTo me, it seems like OP is being chastised for not reading her BF\u2019s mind about his insecurities, and for trying something new to make him happy."]}
