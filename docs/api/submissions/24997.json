Maybe phrase it this way when it comes up.", "Nta. Interesting how he was ok with it until his friends weren\u2019t. And he calls you immature? What do you call someone who collapses under peer pressure?", "NTA. Dino party isn't childish/silly but your boyfriend is.

He should have been more mature and protected you from his bad friends and avoid them.", "NTA. Those \u201cfriends\u201d are not friends. I think you are amazing for doing this.

Only really immature, insecure and toxic people would.", "NTA I, 49F, would get a kick out of a dinosaur party and I am not into Dinos much. I recall going through a long phase in my teens and 20s where I was desperate to shed childish things and appear like a \u201cadult\u201d.  So I probably would have gotten upset and given into peer pressure as well, unless the whole thing was a joke version.  \n\nHe needs to be appreciative of the love and effort that you put into this for him.  This kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen to many people, he found a really caring girlfriend.  Don\u2019t ever stop being this person, even if you end up with someone else, it is special.  \n\nIf he reads this, dude you need to learn to own the things that you like and stop caring about the opinions of others.  You will have nothing but regret not being yourself.  \n\nAlso, I am writing this in my home filled with comics, games and, Star Trek stuff everywhere. Because that is what I love and I will let no one shame me into conformity.", "NTA. That party sounds awesome!", "NTA - He was happy, until his friends pointed it out.\n\nYou thought that \"/ made fun of him\" would let him know that it was ok to have fun despite what his friends thought about it.\n\nY-T-A, if he did not liked the party in the first place and canceled the party. That was not the case. It seems to me, he is caving in to \"social pressure\" / teasing from his friends.", "NTA My friend turned 30 and wanted a space sloth themed party. That\u2019s what she got. It was silly and fun. I guess next time he can have party themed after retirement accounts and live, laugh, love signs.\n\n>Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\n- C.S. Lewis", "NTA - they\u2019re all fake friends !

She has done themed parties for her husband for years. They are always well thought out and a ton of fun.
