To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\n- C.S. Lewis", "NTA - they\u2019re all fake friends !

If they are the type to dress up for Halloween adult parties. Perhaps they should be reminded, \"You are dressing up? How childish of you\" or any hobbies they have. And then see their reactions.", "A Dino party *is* childish and silly - that's what makes it fun.

OP, you're a friggin catch", "54yo female here...it seems that, the older I get, the less I care about the opinions of others...I realize they lie in that person's own insecurity and ego...quite sad, actually, to feel the need to be so fake to others...but when we're younger, some of us feel that need to be like everyone else, belittling those who refuse to conform...", "Same here. I'd be over the moon if I was thrown a dino-themed party, and I only have a slight interest in them.\n\nAnd when I hear about people giving others grief for liking \"childish\" things, I think about this quote from C.S.Lewis: \u201cWhen I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\u201d\n\nI'm a proud geek myself, and you can pry my geeky/childish things from my cold, dead hands.", "I\u2018m coming, too!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Full-blown child\u2019s birthday party, with 7-up sherbet punch (absolutely loaded with vodka), a pi\u00f1ata, bubble wands, party hats, ice cream cake, the works. Our friends had a *blast*. It was one of the best parties I\u2019ve ever thrown. \n\nBy 25, people should be well over the whole \u201cEw that\u2019s for *kids*\u201d phase of their lives.
