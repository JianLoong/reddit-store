To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\n- C.S. Lewis", "NTA - they\u2019re all fake friends !

You're a cool gf, he's a chump", "NTA Normally I would be on the dump his ungrateful ass train, but I do feel bad for him. He needs better friends and to not be ashamed of his interests.

I know that everyone is upvoting her and downvoting you and probably me.\n\nBut I agree, and I also think both things can be true.

Find someone who will appreciate that incredibly sweet and thoughtful gesture. \n\nBecause at the end of the day he's only upset because his friends are teasing him.

OP went above and beyond to give her boyfriend something that meant a lot to him.

You wish you had someone who liked you enough to throw YOU a dinosaur party!' and just leave it alone. \n\nYou should never let someone steal your joy.

I think people often forget or just dont take into account how much social pressure men receive on top of little to no emotional regulation skills.
