I\u2019d be less harsh if you were asking a member of the bridal party to match everyone else\u2019s aesthetic but you\u2019re asking the GROOM to not - in his mind - look his best at his wedding. Also, I\u2019ve been to a wedding where the guy has piercings and he wore them and his suit. Wasn\u2019t an issue.", "YTA\n\nSince you keep repeating yourself in comments let me address your argument directly. You say that his facial piercings don\u2019t go with his suit. Well, like many things fashion / appearance related, that is your subjective opinion. I\u2019ve seen many people wear suits with facial piercings and look just fine.\n\nYou seem to think that the piercings aren\u2019t formal enough or something. But the thing is, your fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t agree with you. And what\u2019s more, your subjective opinion is making him feel like you don\u2019t like his piercings at all and are rejecting what he looks like. \n\nSo you have to decide: do you want a happy, confident partner on your wedding day? Or do you want a sad, unconfident, and resentful partner?", "YTA\n\nPiercings are obviously very important to your fianc\u00e9 and they're a big part of his identity. He would have had them when you met, and they've never been an issue to you previously, so to demand that he removes them on the basis that you don't like how they look with a suit is, I think, pretty unreasonable and inconsiderate.", "This marriage is not gonna go well.

I understand that, aesthetically, the piercings may not \"go\" with a suit or tux, but my goal was always to make the person buying the suit feel confident in it, no matter what they looked like. He could easily add some cool accessories (pocket square, tie, tie clip, a cool pair of shoes) to complement his piercings. I've done it for customers many times. \n\nYour wedding is about showing the world that you love this person for everything that they are, not what Instagram thinks they should be. \n\nYTA and my question to you is, why don't you want your fianc\u00e9e to look like himself on your wedding day?", "YTA. You're asking your husband to be to forfeit his authenticity for photos. Wtf, he's going to be your HUSBAND he's not a prop. It's as much his day as it is yours. From your comments, you seem to be a very shallow person. Please don't be THAT bride who's wedding day is all about you. This is about you and him starting a life together. A wedding is just the party. The marriage is what counts and you want to start off your marriage by inferring that your husband isn't good enough as he is. If his current jewelry isn't \"good enough\" find something else and gift it to him FOR the wedding. Get your head out of your ass please.", "YTA for being controlling and for treating your fianc\u00e9 as a wedding photo prop. \n\nI\u2019m also struggling to figure out how facial piercings don\u2019t \u201cgo along\u201d with a suit??? It\u2019s JEWELRY.

You asked, he said no.", "INFO: Why don't you buy him some jewelry that matches the suit?", "YTA. You want him to look his best, which is apparently different than how he looks every single day. What if he wanted you to look your best and it hadn\u2019t nothing to do with how you look every day? How would you feel about that? Your photos are more important to you than how your fianc\u00e9 feels about himself.", "As someone with two facial piercings, and stretched ears I have to say YTA. There\u2019s a lot of reasons people get body modifications and many of them are deeply personal. I got mine for significant life events. They are part of me. Family have asked me to take mine out for events and all that says is \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be yourself because being yourself isn\u2019t appropriate when other people are looking.\u201d In this case you\u2019re telling your fiancee that he\u2019s only allowed to be himself when /you/ think it\u2019s appropriate. Sounds a lot like guys who make their gf\u2019s dye their hair because their natural color \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good.\u201d You say this is a one time thing but I highly doubt that\u2019s true. I expect you\u2019ll demand the same of him for any formal event, as this will most certainly not be the last time he wears a suit. This is a red flag for developing a common controlling behavior some women develop after marriage. I suspect you\u2019re one of those people who think men aren\u2019t allowed to have their own identity, or interests once you\u2019re married. First it\u2019s the piercings for the wedding, which will be used as an excuse to ask him to remove them permanently. \u201cYou looked so good in our wedding photos why don\u2019t you just take them out for good?\u201d Next it\u2019s his hobbies because \u201cthere\u2019s not enough space.\u201d Then it will be his friends, and possibly family that you\u2019ll want to remove because you don\u2019t like them for some arbitrary reason. Cause husbands are obviously only allowed to be providers, and accessories. Do you actually want a husband or just someone you can control? Do you even actually like your fiancee?", "YTA - If you get to choose what you wear at your wedding, he gets to choose what he wears.", "YTA", "Info - in what way do the piercings clash with his suit? Would he be willing to change the piercings to something that matches?", "YTA --- If he asked you to shave your head for the wedding would you do it?.", "YTA.  It's fine to ask once.  The way people look on their wedding day is often significantly more formal and conventional than their everyday look.  But to keep insisting when he's saying the piercings stay, and then accuse him of overreacting ... yeah, clearly YTA.", "Yta not your face", "If I were him, I would pick a different wedding attire. Just to take away this one stupid argument you're hiding behind. Nothing angers me more than a shity person being shity but not wanting to own up to it. You're making up bullshit excuses. \n\nYTA", "I cant see why he cant just wear them and you not make a fuss, it works both ways!", "YTA \n\nthis is weird and controlling. let him express himself. also if they were taken out for a full day there\u2019s a chance they would close up.", "YTA\n\nThis is such a stupid thing to torpedo your own wedding over. I'm lightly pierced myself, and had to retire one of mine recently. Everytime I caught a glimps of that area I felt so out of sorts and not like myself at all. Hadnt it been due to health reasons, I would probably have put it back in because I just couldnt shake the feeling of how wrong I looked and how much it bothered me, and its not even somewhere nearly as constantly on display as your face. It still took weeks to get used to. \n\nThats what you want your fiance to feel throughout his wedding day, because you dont feel like the piercings match the suit. Self conscious, out of sorts, uncomfortable and wrong. Thats the feelings you're asking him to assosiate with getting married to you. The woman who supposedly loves him, but puts aetsethichs before his comfort. \n\nAnd the comment I saw about him having a hight pain tollerace, as a reply to someone pointing out that it can be painfull to remove sertain ones? Get right in the bin. You're either too immature or too shallow to be getting married anytime soon, let the poor man be.", ">However he keeps insisting that I'm being unreasonable and overbearing and his piercings shouldn't represent a bid deal, but if that's the case then I can't see why he can't just remove them for our wedding without making a fuss about it.\n\nOh...you're in full loophole mode and beyond reason. You're not listening to him or even trying to consider his feelings, you're just selectively listening for an angle of attack. You heard his words, but didn't provide a reason yourself. You only saw, \"well if it shouldn't represent a big deal to me that means they're not a big deal in general,\" which btw isn't a logical follow up. After all, all you've said is, \"they don't go with his suit.\" Then get a different one or get over it.\n\nSeriously, you should really question yourself about whether you're marrying him for a wedding or a marriage, because you're showing real, \"I just want the party\" vibes.\n\nAlso, your boyfriend has legitimate cause for concern in this, because it always starts with, \"it's just for this occasion,\" and then it's another occasion, and then it's, \"people will find it weird that a parent has so many piercings, and I don't want the teachers at school to think less of us because of your piercings.\" Your husband to be is probably worried you're just starting your start of darkness in winnowing away his features until he's a bland nothing waking up at 40 realizing he married a woman who loved him for what he could be moulded into. I can't say the worry is illegitimate.\n\nYTA", "I get why you wouldn\u2019t want your fianc\u00e9 to wear his facial piercings at the wedding but if he says no and you continue to push the issue, you would be Y T A. Either accept he doesn\u2019t want to take them out or see if he is willing to take out some.", "NTA for asking. He feels like it\u2019s part of his identity and wants to leave them in. Continuing to try to force your preference on him makes YTA.", "How about looking for different piercings that would compliment his suit as a compromise?", "NTA. I can see wanting to look back in 30 years and see him as him without all that stuff in the way. He\u2019s not gonna have all that in the future. If he does then chances are he didn\u2019t grow up and you got divorced anyway.", "NTA, which goes against the rest of these posts. So here's why, 10-15-20 years from now, he'll look back on those wedding photos and wonder \"what was I thinking\" wearing facial piercings for the wedding. They are not his identity, they are jewelry. His identity is the person he is. He also should respect your wishes that he not wear them for the few hours of a wedding.", ">  I'm being unreasonable and overbearing and his piercings shouldn't represent a bid deal\n\nWell indeed except they seem to be a big deal for him.

Unless he got these piercings yesterday you knew what he looked like each and every day. I\u2019m sure he wants to look like himself on his wedding day. I think you need to reevaluate why you want him to remove the piercings. Is it because you have some cookie cutter, beauty magazine image of what a groom should look like? I bet your fianc\u00e9 is more interesting than that and that\u2019s one of the reasons you love him. Maybe he could wear a different style or color of jewelry to go with the attire.

Doctors in the US are generally not government employees. The exception would be doctors that work for the VA system (military veterans), doctors that work within tribal hospital systems (for Native Americans), and doctors in the military. I may have missed a couple of others, but basically those are systems reserved for certain segments of the population and people within those populations can choose to use those doctors or choose their own private doctor.\n\nIn the US, except for a few exceptions like medicare (for those 65 and over), healthcare is not funded by our tax dollars. A doctor that you might go to or that I might go to as a member of the general populace is going to be a part of the private healthcare system. In the US, we don't have a broad public healthcare system. We have (mostly) private doctors and hospitals. Those doctors charge the patient at the time of service and/or send a bill (depending on the situation). Most people are going to have some sort of insurance through their employer or, for those of us that are retired, that we purchase on our own. So the doctor's office would send a bill to the insurance company and the insurance would pay the doctor's office for everything except what the patient owes. Then the patient would receive a separate invoice. It's more detailed than that, but those are the basics.\n\nIf someone doesn't have insurance, they receive the entire bill. Sometimes doctors will offer a discount for \"self-pay\", but that depends on the situation. Sometimes states have funds to help out those who cannot afford their hospital bills. Some states have state funded \"insurance\" that covers their medical. I'm in Oklahoma and we have what's called Sooner Care that, in particular, covers health care costs for minors. Parents can sign their kids up for that and it's a relatively easy process.\n\nETA: I know our system seems convoluted. It is and mostly because our government has made it that way. It's also become expensive due to certain laws requiring plans to cover certain items even if the customer/patient doesn't need those services. The whole system needs reform, but at the same time, there's not a lot better out there.

We were all in the ladies' room which had one of those classy \"rest areas\" with couches.   They were intrigued by the vanilla smoke...  \nThen \"Hey can you show us how to do that?\".
