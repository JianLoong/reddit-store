I\u2019d be less harsh if you were asking a member of the bridal party to match everyone else\u2019s aesthetic but you\u2019re asking the GROOM to not - in his mind - look his best at his wedding. Also, I\u2019ve been to a wedding where the guy has piercings and he wore them and his suit. Wasn\u2019t an issue.", "YTA\n\nSince you keep repeating yourself in comments let me address your argument directly. You say that his facial piercings don\u2019t go with his suit. Well, like many things fashion / appearance related, that is your subjective opinion. I\u2019ve seen many people wear suits with facial piercings and look just fine.\n\nYou seem to think that the piercings aren\u2019t formal enough or something. But the thing is, your fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t agree with you. And what\u2019s more, your subjective opinion is making him feel like you don\u2019t like his piercings at all and are rejecting what he looks like. \n\nSo you have to decide: do you want a happy, confident partner on your wedding day? Or do you want a sad, unconfident, and resentful partner?", "YTA\n\nPiercings are obviously very important to your fianc\u00e9 and they're a big part of his identity. He would have had them when you met, and they've never been an issue to you previously, so to demand that he removes them on the basis that you don't like how they look with a suit is, I think, pretty unreasonable and inconsiderate.", "This marriage is not gonna go well.

I understand that, aesthetically, the piercings may not \"go\" with a suit or tux, but my goal was always to make the person buying the suit feel confident in it, no matter what they looked like. He could easily add some cool accessories (pocket square, tie, tie clip, a cool pair of shoes) to complement his piercings. I've done it for customers many times. \n\nYour wedding is about showing the world that you love this person for everything that they are, not what Instagram thinks they should be. \n\nYTA and my question to you is, why don't you want your fianc\u00e9e to look like himself on your wedding day?", "YTA. You're asking your husband to be to forfeit his authenticity for photos. Wtf, he's going to be your HUSBAND he's not a prop. It's as much his day as it is yours. From your comments, you seem to be a very shallow person. Please don't be THAT bride who's wedding day is all about you. This is about you and him starting a life together. A wedding is just the party. The marriage is what counts and you want to start off your marriage by inferring that your husband isn't good enough as he is. If his current jewelry isn't \"good enough\" find something else and gift it to him FOR the wedding. Get your head out of your ass please.", "YTA for being controlling and for treating your fianc\u00e9 as a wedding photo prop. \n\nI\u2019m also struggling to figure out how facial piercings don\u2019t \u201cgo along\u201d with a suit??? It\u2019s JEWELRY.

You asked, he said no.", "INFO: Why don't you buy him some jewelry that matches the suit?", "YTA. You want him to look his best, which is apparently different than how he looks every single day. What if he wanted you to look your best and it hadn\u2019t nothing to do with how you look every day? How would you feel about that? Your photos are more important to you than how your fianc\u00e9 feels about himself.", "As someone with two facial piercings, and stretched ears I have to say YTA. There\u2019s a lot of reasons people get body modifications and many of them are deeply personal. I got mine for significant life events. They are part of me. Family have asked me to take mine out for events and all that says is \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be yourself because being yourself isn\u2019t appropriate when other people are looking.\u201d In this case you\u2019re telling your fiancee that he\u2019s only allowed to be himself when /you/ think it\u2019s appropriate. Sounds a lot like guys who make their gf\u2019s dye their hair because their natural color \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good.\u201d You say this is a one time thing but I highly doubt that\u2019s true. I expect you\u2019ll demand the same of him for any formal event, as this will most certainly not be the last time he wears a suit. This is a red flag for developing a common controlling behavior some women develop after marriage. I suspect you\u2019re one of those people who think men aren\u2019t allowed to have their own identity, or interests once you\u2019re married. First it\u2019s the piercings for the wedding, which will be used as an excuse to ask him to remove them permanently. \u201cYou looked so good in our wedding photos why don\u2019t you just take them out for good?\u201d Next it\u2019s his hobbies because \u201cthere\u2019s not enough space.\u201d Then it will be his friends, and possibly family that you\u2019ll want to remove because you don\u2019t like them for some arbitrary reason. Cause husbands are obviously only allowed to be providers, and accessories. Do you actually want a husband or just someone you can control? Do you even actually like your fiancee?", "YTA - If you get to choose what you wear at your wedding, he gets to choose what he wears.", "YTA", "Info - in what way do the piercings clash with his suit? Would he be willing to change the piercings to something that matches?", "YTA --- If he asked you to shave your head for the wedding would you do it?.", "YTA.  It's fine to ask once.  The way people look on their wedding day is often significantly more formal and conventional than their everyday look.  But to keep insisting when he's saying the piercings stay, and then accuse him of overreacting ... yeah, clearly YTA.", "Yta not your face", "If I were him, I would pick a different wedding attire. Just to take away this one stupid argument you're hiding behind. Nothing angers me more than a shity person being shity but not wanting to own up to it. You're making up bullshit excuses. \n\nYTA", "I cant see why he cant just wear them and you not make a fuss, it works both ways!", "YTA \n\nthis is weird and controlling. let him express himself. also if they were taken out for a full day there\u2019s a chance they would close up.", "YTA\n\nThis is such a stupid thing to torpedo your own wedding over. I'm lightly pierced myself, and had to retire one of mine recently. Everytime I caught a glimps of that area I felt so out of sorts and not like myself at all. Hadnt it been due to health reasons, I would probably have put it back in because I just couldnt shake the feeling of how wrong I looked and how much it bothered me, and its not even somewhere nearly as constantly on display as your face. It still took weeks to get used to. \n\nThats what you want your fiance to feel throughout his wedding day, because you dont feel like the piercings match the suit. Self conscious, out of sorts, uncomfortable and wrong. Thats the feelings you're asking him to assosiate with getting married to you. The woman who supposedly loves him, but puts aetsethichs before his comfort. \n\nAnd the comment I saw about him having a hight pain tollerace, as a reply to someone pointing out that it can be painfull to remove sertain ones? Get right in the bin. You're either too immature or too shallow to be getting married anytime soon, let the poor man be.", ">However he keeps insisting that I'm being unreasonable and overbearing and his piercings shouldn't represent a bid deal, but if that's the case then I can't see why he can't just remove them for our wedding without making a fuss about it.\n\nOh...you're in full loophole mode and beyond reason. You're not listening to him or even trying to consider his feelings, you're just selectively listening for an angle of attack. You heard his words, but didn't provide a reason yourself. You only saw, \"well if it shouldn't represent a big deal to me that means they're not a big deal in general,\" which btw isn't a logical follow up. After all, all you've said is, \"they don't go with his suit.\" Then get a different one or get over it.\n\nSeriously, you should really question yourself about whether you're marrying him for a wedding or a marriage, because you're showing real, \"I just want the party\" vibes.\n\nAlso, your boyfriend has legitimate cause for concern in this, because it always starts with, \"it's just for this occasion,\" and then it's another occasion, and then it's, \"people will find it weird that a parent has so many piercings, and I don't want the teachers at school to think less of us because of your piercings.\" Your husband to be is probably worried you're just starting your start of darkness in winnowing away his features until he's a bland nothing waking up at 40 realizing he married a woman who loved him for what he could be moulded into. I can't say the worry is illegitimate.\n\nYTA", "I get why you wouldn\u2019t want your fianc\u00e9 to wear his facial piercings at the wedding but if he says no and you continue to push the issue, you would be Y T A. Either accept he doesn\u2019t want to take them out or see if he is willing to take out some.", "NTA for asking. He feels like it\u2019s part of his identity and wants to leave them in. Continuing to try to force your preference on him makes YTA.", "How about looking for different piercings that would compliment his suit as a compromise?", "NTA. I can see wanting to look back in 30 years and see him as him without all that stuff in the way. He\u2019s not gonna have all that in the future. If he does then chances are he didn\u2019t grow up and you got divorced anyway.", "NTA, which goes against the rest of these posts. So here's why, 10-15-20 years from now, he'll look back on those wedding photos and wonder \"what was I thinking\" wearing facial piercings for the wedding. They are not his identity, they are jewelry. His identity is the person he is. He also should respect your wishes that he not wear them for the few hours of a wedding.", ">  I'm being unreasonable and overbearing and his piercings shouldn't represent a bid deal\n\nWell indeed except they seem to be a big deal for him.

Unless he got these piercings yesterday you knew what he looked like each and every day. I\u2019m sure he wants to look like himself on his wedding day. I think you need to reevaluate why you want him to remove the piercings. Is it because you have some cookie cutter, beauty magazine image of what a groom should look like? I bet your fianc\u00e9 is more interesting than that and that\u2019s one of the reasons you love him. Maybe he could wear a different style or color of jewelry to go with the attire.

So what\u2019s more important to you, your perception that his look doesn\u2019t go with his suit OR your groom feeling 100% himself, comfortable and happy on your wedding day?", "You are marrying a pierced person. If you can't stand that at your wedding you probably shouldn't marry him at all.", "You're young, so you'll probably learn this before your second marriage i hope, but the groom is actually a human being and not just a decorative object on the wedding day", "Why not have him get fancy ones that DO go with his suit. You are getting married, and you need to learn how to compromise so both of you are happy. YTA", "Then change the suit, rather than trying to change the person wearing it. YTA, and you are being ridiculously shallow. You care more about the suit than the person you are marrying.", "So your aesthetic is more important than your fiance's comfort?", "Ask him to get some that match the suit then maybe? I would imagine he would prefer to look back on wedding pictures and see his face how he is used to seeing it... I wouldn't have liked my wedding pictures if I had to do something that would make my face look different than I am used to...\n\nIf you don't wear makeup, how would you feel if he asked you to wear a full face of makeup for the wedding day? And if you do wear makeup, how would you feel if he asked you to not wear any for the wedding day? \nFor me, that would change how I feel about my entire outfit.", "It\u2019s only a silly wedding. Wear whatever you want, however you want", "Then change the suit, not the man. YTA.", "If you\u2019re only gonna look at them once per year then I don\u2019t see why you would be so mad that you would see his piercings in them.", "Seems to me like the central issue for him would be that you aren't allowing him to be himself at his own wedding, rather than the pictures.", "You don't just look at wedding photos once a year. Typically people frame them and put them on the wall in full view of things. You give prints to family, who also hang them on the wall. These aren't just pictures that get stuffed away and brought out on your anniversary. They'll also likely be uploaded to Social Media, and be a yearly memory popup of how you asked him to change himself for silly aesthetic purposes. If aesthetics are that important to you, maybe gift him some jewelry that will go with his suit as a wedding present. \n\nSoft YTA- because I think that you're likely a nice person, you're just caught up in having a pinterest perfect wedding. Hopefully you can let go of that and be happy you're spending the rest of your life with someone you love.", "Unless he suddenly got the piercings after he proposed,  then why are you against them.  Aren't they part of the man you are marrying? The man you said yes to and supposedly love ?", "This is so funny. Everyone thinks they will drag those photos out all the time and look at them. Reality is that never happens and no one else gives two shits about your wedding photos.", "Why are you so mad you\u2019ll have to see them? Oh no, seeing your husband happy as he is, how terrible for you.", "Incorrect. You look at them once ever 20 years lol", "That's a lie, you probably would have remembered how the alphabet works", "Oh well, problem solved. You don't think it will hurt him so it's fine. \ud83d\ude44 Christ, how callous can you be.", "Oh, WhY dIdN\u2019T yOu SaY sO OP? A \u201cHiGh PaIN ToLErAnCe\u201d, well, in which case, screw him, right? Just remove his sense of self because \u201cIt\u2019s your day\u201d /s\n\nJeez, OP YTA, let the man have his pierced face - if it bothers you so much, get some nice new piercings that \u201cmatch\u201d the suit.", "My God you sound insufferable", "It actually hurt to take out a nose ring. I'm not sure if that's where his piercings are located. I took mine out for almost an hour to please my mother, and I couldn't get it back it. If it's an eyebrow piercing, then it's going to be a big hole that looks like crap. YTA", "You already saw him with his piercings. Just because he's now in a suit you have a problem with his appearance. It makes you seem really shallow.", "Have you considered a few things here? \nPiercings are literally holes in your body. \n\n1. When you take out the piercings, there's a higher risk of stuff going into the holes, sweat, etc. especially when you push the piercings back in (depending on where in the face) \n\n2. Instead of metal, I'm sorry to tell you, again, depending on where the piercings are and how many, you will now be looking at a bunch of holes in his face. which isn't exactly \"going much better with the suit\" \n\n3. When you pick out your piercings, that you are so used to for a long period of time. The first hours most feel strange without them. The lack of them, not being able to feel them. And can feel really self-conscious.\nAnd some piercings. And depending on the person. The hole can actually \"start closing\" pretty quickly. I know someone with an eyebrow one. He had to take it out for about 5 hours. When he wanted to put it back in, he was struggling to even push it through.\n\nIt's who he is. Not \"pettiness\" \nImagine he told you \"oh i think you would look nicer without makeup on our wedding day\" (if you are a makeup person). \nOr something that you would absolutely not want to not wear at the wedding because it's part of you.", "That wasn't the question and you know it. You are deliberately being obtuse. Think about it for a minute from a hypothetical standpoint. Say your fiance told you he didn't like your hair and wanted you to shave it for the wedding, would you? Would you remove your eyebrows? I mean, you can draw them back on, right? \n\nSay he didn't like your dress, would you get a new one? Or just go naked? or your shoes, or your makeup, or your nose, or your maid of honour, or your mother, god knows what. If he asked you to change something that you feel is important to you, would you? Because it sounds like you wouldn't. Honestly, that's just heartbreaking to think that he's going to be saddled with someone who doesn't seem to care for his wants and will argue with him this much over something that should be so simple and small. \n\nGet some perspective. In ten years will it really matter? if the answer for you is yes, don't fucking marry the guy, because your priorities are beyond messed up.", "\u201cMy wedding day\u201d\n\nSays it all really. It\u2019s your wedding day not his, or yours as a couple. His feelings and opinions are therefore irrelevant.", "I don't know what you're referring to. A lot of people are told not to wear their glasses or to straighten their natural hair to look \"better\" for a wedding but that's ot who they are. He wants to look like himself. It's not like he wants to wear cargo shorts. It's a minimal difference to the look but means a lot to him and it's his body.", "/u/PuzzleheCText6 is a bot that copied part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u1381/aita_for_asking_my_fiance_not_to_wear_his_facial/jr59yj8/", "Not even to that extreme: he can simply ask her to wear a blonde wig on the day if she\u2019s a brunette or the other way around. After all, it\u2019s only one day, it doesn\u2019t affect her identity, and the temporary hair will look better with her dress. Surely OP won\u2019t have a problem complying.", "There\u2019s no such thing.", "I\u2019ve been married for four years and just looked at my wedding album for the first time since making it \ud83e\udd23", "I got married a year ago and have literally like never looked at the pictures, i genuinely don\u2019t get all the pressure people people put on wedding picy", "My parents are married 38 years and they lost their wedding albums like 15 years ago lmao. I saw the pictures a couple times when I was a kid but that was it.", "I obviously think he looks good with piercings in general, but they just don't go along with his suit at all, that's why I don't want him to wear them with it.", "I have my ears pierced, had them done at 11 now 40. My daughter ripped one out when she was baby so I didn't wear any earrings for 8 years, I had to get the holes redone and now I can't even take them out for an hour before it becomes hard to get them back in,I left them out overnight and had to get the piercer to put them back in!", "I refer to myself without my septum piercing as \"nakey nose\" because of how I feel without it. Plus once you have had those jewelry in for so long and you are used to how you look with it, you feel self conscious without it", "It\u2019s not? It\u2019s something that can be taken on or off to look certain ways.  Who are you to judge if I feel most comfortable in the cargo shorts look?", "What an amazingly uninformed and untrue take.", "But there are???? I have seen some beautiful ones at weddings mostly for women, but I have seen a few for men. They are true adornments. Although cost they 1000 minimum per single earring.", "6 years here and the only time I see my wedding pics are when they pop up on Facebook every year", "did he get a say in your look for the day, or did you just pick whatever you wanted?", "Personally I'm not a fan of facial piercings on a man. But that's just my opinion and I wouldn't want to impose my opinions on someone else.\n\nYou hopefully love him since you are marrying him. The piercings are a part of who he is. Asking him to take them out for the wedding is bound to have upset him. To continue to ask him just shows that you think you are more important than him and that your feelings are more important than his.", "Who cares though lol. It\u2019s not really important"]}
