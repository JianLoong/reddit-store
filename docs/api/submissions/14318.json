Talk to her & find out why she needed your company & be there for her emotionally, as it will be important going forward.

I had my son at 33 weeks and if my partner had been away on a non obligatory thing I\u2019d ask him not go to on I would\u2026 not have been happy. Being pregnant can be scary and lonely and it\u2019s not something you can just take a two days away from. Having a high risk pregnancy sometimes feels like being trapped in a prison with a bomb strapped to you. She wanted her husband around in case it exploded and you and your mother are calling her unreasonable for that.", "Then you definitely weren\u2019t in the wrong here. My NTA stands. Your mother was on hand (and capable) to do anything that you would have done in the case of emergency anyway. Plus, she\u2019s under a doctor\u2019s care who would have advised you to stay nearby if that was the case. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t bring it up; just act like everything is normal. She\u2019ll hopefully regain objectivity again. Pregnancy can do insane things to people, and I would give her some grace for that reason.", "So she has a high risk of pre eclampsia....\n\n\nCould you have told your work that you needed to stay home and attend remotely? \ud83e\udd14", "Did she want you to?", "Did you miss where he said she's high risk? Especially if it's their first child, it is terrifying to know that one wrong move can kill you or your baby. She needed him, told him ahead of time, and he still left her for two days. Op is TAH.", "You must be a man lol.  I am too\ud83d\ude0a", "How long would it take you to get back if something did go wrong? I think the distance matters.", "Look I personally see this as NAHs very slightly leaning toward NTA, this is her first kid and she\u2019s probably running on hormones at this point which can explain her reaction and feelings of abandonment and she isn\u2019t an AH for that depending on how long she\u2019s trying to punish her husband. Neither one of them are in the wrong because op getting a promotion is beneficial for the whole family while she is already high risk and super hormonal and is probably feeling scared and alone as well as cut off from the world as I\u2019m sure she\u2019s on a lot of bed rest, not to mention mortality rates for women in the US(assuming that\u2019s where they are) is quite high. Honestly they just need to sit down and talk about this and acknowledge and validate each others feelings to get back on the same page. As most couples do, they are not looking at it as them vs the problem but them vs eachother. Hopefully this all works out for everyone.", "While I can agree with most of that the part that leaves me sticking to soft ah is that he isn't validating her very real and reasonable fear. He's calling her unreasonable when the issues that can arise from pre-eclampsia and diabetes are very serious and she is absolutely right to be terrified right now. This is her 1st pregnancy. I don't think he's TA because he went, I think he's TA for invalidating her terrifying reality, and leaving her feeling abandoned and like she was wrong for those feelings. \n\nI 1000% agree they need to talk about it, but he needs to first come at it by validating her feelings. I doubt she'd want to communicate before that.", "Luckily according to her last check up everything's ok and she's due to give birth on the 38/ 39 week, she's not close to the expected due date", "They do have a good relationship, I understand how her mom would be the better option but my MIL straight up refused to help, I believe my wife appreciates my mom for helping out.", "I had my kids at 37, 34, and 30 weeks, all due to known issues that put me on bed rest from about 24 weeks onward, and I still think OP is NTA. He wasn\u2019t inaccessible and he wasn\u2019t on vacation. I\u2019m not going to call wife an A H because she isn\u2019t, but unless their doctor told them otherwise, he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Emergencies were covered for a short period of time.\n\nY\u2019all YTA folks are almost acting like OP should quit his job and be with wife 24/7.", "The meeting wasn't obligatory if someone was busy, but as I am running for a promotion is important they can see my compromise with the company, that's why I feel like it was important to go", "No", "I did. It depends on why she\u2019s high risk. OP did not elaborate and in my actual vote comment I queried whether or not it was super serious. Being high risk doesn\u2019t necessarily mean life-threatening. It can be as simple as the wife is a smoker. So if OP elaborated on it, I missed it. \n\nEven so, being only five hours away and with another fully competent adult there, I\u2019m still inclined to say doing something to benefit your family financially doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole.", "Agree,  op is working to show employer that they are a priority so he'll get a raise and need to work more,  but not showing the mother to be of his child that she is a priority.", "No-I\u2019m a happily married woman, and we have three kids (all high risk pregnancies). I just know that if my husband did what OP did (he did-many times) that he would have been doing it for US. That\u2019s exactly what a joint partnership should be like.", "Five hours going not a maximum speed (allowed obviously), I don't like to drive that fast but I would, maybe it could be cut to 3:30/ 4 hours drive", "The US mortality rate headlines for 2021 say up 40%\u2026.. that said in 2021 there were 1205 deaths to 3,659,289 births so the actual mortality rate was .00329%. Was terrified of giving birth this year to my 4th. Luckily my therapist is a numbers person so helped me with the statistics. I do this calculation anytime I get nervous about my impending labor. Thought I\u2019d share in case any other anxious preggo\u2019s see this thread", "Where I don\u2019t see him being the AH here is that im assuming he\u2019s at least tried to talk to her to resolve this and she\u2019s cold shouldering and ignoring him which isn\u2019t fixing the problem, even if she was lashing out it would be a starting ground for a conversation and while she may be hurt, the silent treatment is never fair to your partner. The reality is that he doesn\u2019t understand her feelings but based off the comments is at least trying, he doesn\u2019t understand how it feels when your emotions are elevated 10 fold with pregnancy so seems to not be grasping how much this affected her, he probably believes she was just a little scared or nervous and doesn\u2019t realize how those emotions can be overwhelming while pregnant. If he refused to work on this at all and think his wife just needs to calm or something alone those lines, it would definitely make him an AH but OPs comments show that while he may not understand, he is willing to apologize and try to sit down with her to understand and figure this out. Effort and intentions do matter and while OP may not be the best with empathy, not everyone is and he\u2019s trying which to me means a lot more that he\u2019s willing to work on these issues.", "This is odd to me. Why doesn\u2019t your MIL want to help? It\u2019s awesome that your mom is willing to help and that your wife appreciates it. Honestly I\u2019m going with NAH. Your wife is probably scared and worried about the pregnancy and the baby and while yes you wouldn\u2019t know what to do if something went sideways (as you are not a medical professional), she probably just feels better with you around. That being said, you\u2019re not the AH either as you didn\u2019t leave your wife alone and this possible promotion is most likely good for your whole family. Just keep talking to her and let her know you love her and will support her as much as you are able.", "That good relationship may not continue if the price your wife pays for having your mom there is your mom hanging up with you against her.", "Cool, and I\u2019m happy that that was your experience. And really, I probably wouldn\u2019t have had an issue with my partner going either. But I\u2019m not her, and she obviously did. Obviously she had some anxiety and\ntrepidation around it. This is her first baby, she\u2019s dealing with pre eclampsia, it\u2019s been a rough pregnancy and the meeting wasn\u2019t compulsory. I don\u2019t for a second think pregnant women should be covered in bubble wrap like they\u2019re delicate and breakable but I think she has enough valid reason to feel the way she does to make OP a little bit of the AH", "So your job is more important than your family......", "It's serious but it's not life threatening as of for now, everything was ok on her last check up which was last week", "Now I get why you\u2019re happily married\ud83d\ude00", "She's not very happy with our marriage, my wife and her have had some other issues in the past too", "My mom told me she agrees with me while talking privately, she didn't told this to my wife", "That is a much better explanation. I do know that just because it was fine for me or you, that it may not have been fine for OP\u2019s wife. However, they are equal partners in this and he gets a vote too. My husband left many times-(once when I did have an emergency). I didn\u2019t like it, but I knew he was doing it for us and our family. I acknowledge that we won\u2019t all feel the same way and I also agree that she is NTA-her feelings are definitely valid. I just disagree that this makes him an AH just because she didn\u2019t like it. Not to mention that nothing happened, he is back, and she is punishing him-which is needless now.\n\nI\u2019d also add that it\u2019s likely that he is the much more level-headed decision maker at the moment. I definitely wasn\u2019t myself through my pregnancies. In hindsight, I\u2019m eternally grateful that my husband didn\u2019t listen to some of my insane requests.", "Not arguing your point but high blood pressure in pregnancy doesn\u2019t automatically mean preeclampsia", "My family is important, I want to get the promotion so we can buy a house and stop renting", "Gossiping about your wife behind her back with your mom isn\u2019t going to do good things for your marriage.", "When someone says \u2018it\u2019s a high risk pregnancy due to her high blood pressure\u2019 it\u2019s not an unreasonable assumption. And you\u2019re playing semantics - regardless of whether it\u2019s pre eclampsia and gestational diabetes vs high blood pressure and \u2018normal\u2019 diabetes OP has still said these things have both made it a difficult, high risk pregnancy. Which is my point.", "But is that MORE important than your family? \ud83e\udd14", "Not arguing with you. I\u2019m currently in the middle of a high risk pregnancy with high blood pressure (along with a severe autoimmune disease). While preeclampsia is more likely it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I\u2019ll experience it, I do understand why high blood pressure can make a pregnancy more difficult. Just wanted to point out that OP traveling when his wife has high blood pressure is a bit different than traveling when she has preeclampsia.", "No, I called regularly to know if everything was ok or I should drive back home", "Ok but you\u2019re ignoring the part where OP has said that IN THIS CASE those things have made it a high risk pregnancy. I know what you\u2019re saying - I used to be a medic. I understand how blood pressure and pregnancy works. But not everyone is the same. You\u2019re looking at textbook definitions and anecdotal examples - I\u2019m looking at the actual patient in front of me.", "High blood pressure alone makes any pregnancy high risk. Not sure how you\u2019re looking at the patient in front of you when you\u2019re literally just going off of what was said: that she has high blood pressure and diabetes, making this a high risk pregnancy."]}
