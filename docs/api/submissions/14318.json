Talk to her & find out why she needed your company & be there for her emotionally, as it will be important going forward. And always, always, always take her side - do not form a group of you & your Mum against your wife - that is toxic & she will resent you for it.

She\u2019s had a high pregnancy already and the fact that your mother also thinks she\u2019s being unreasonable is a good insight into why your wife doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s a good support person.

I had my son at 33 weeks and if my partner had been away on a non obligatory thing I\u2019d ask him not go to on I would\u2026 not have been happy. Being pregnant can be scary and lonely and it\u2019s not something you can just take a two days away from.

Neither one of them are in the wrong because op getting a promotion is beneficial for the whole family while she is already high risk and super hormonal and is probably feeling scared and alone as well as cut off from the world as I\u2019m sure she\u2019s on a lot of bed rest, not to mention mortality rates for women in the US(assuming that\u2019s where they are) is quite high.

Incase you haven't figured it out yet, you should be talking to your pregnant wife about her feelings... technically they are the only feelings that actually matter at this time. \n\nThat being said. I'm going to go ahead and say that A) you probably think that your wife and mothers relationship is better than it actually is. We women are very good at humoring and tolerating our MILs B) just because your wife can appreciate your moms help doesn't mean that she wants it or wants her staying with her to help her, especially when she's feeling all the things she's feeling right now C) the comfort you would provide for her far out weighs the awkward MIL comfort. Should I keep going? I'll keep going. D) It's your first pregnancy.

She is in an extremely vulnerable position. \n\nFirst pregnancies are scary enough without already being high risk. I get you feel like you did the right thing getting your mom to look after her, and it totally makes sense from your point of view, because she's *your mom*. Your relationship with her spans your entire life up til now, and from your post it seems like you have a good relationship with her, which means you most likely (hopefully) love and trust her a lot. \n\nBut, your wife doesn't have that with her at all. You said their relationship is \"fine\" which, you know, is fine! But, idk, I would not really want to be left alone with a person with whom I had a \"fine\" relationship with if I was in the 3rd trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. \n\nLike, logically I might be able to think \"she's my husband's mom, and he obviously trusts her\" but without a kind of emotional bedrock, that would mean basically nothing to me lol. So what she really wanted, was just *you*, a person she really loves and trusts highly, to be with her in this moment of vulnerability. That's it.

You didn't do anything wrong, but to get to the heart of it, she needs to talk to someone, and you, so she can help manage her anxiety. \n\nUltimately, she's saying she is freaked the fuck out and freaking out big time. She feels alone in her freaking out, as is normal when in a high risk pregnancy, we feel the brunt of the anxiety.

You thinking she isn't \"because your mom is there\", might be presumptuous.\n\nWhat your mom means to you, is not the same as what your mom means to her. She clearly needs some kind of support of someone who's with her, not against her.\n\nThat should be you.\n\nStill NTA, but listen to the signs.", "This. I gotta say pregnancy was so emotionally draining it felt easier to go through it together with my husband. This was not about her not surviving while you were gone, but her feeling like you were dismissive about her concerns.", "She got left with MIL. Personally I'd hate that.", "She\u2019s carrying THEIR child. \n\nI don\u2019t get why the baby is always suddenly just the husbands whenever the husband has done something the wife doesn\u2019t like. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t left alone, it was 48 hours and it will help him get to a better financial place for their family.", "But, situations can happen being high risk ot not, if he was here or not.", "My sister's 6.5 month sudden pre-eclampsia was treated by giving birth via emergency T section. Severe pre-eclampsia is only cured by giving birth.\n\nShe had a healthy no risk pregnancy up until that point. Her feet and legs swelled up terribly like it looked so bad but you hear just like all the people here are saying, ahhhh that's normal. But it wasn't, and her doctor sent her to the hospital where she was diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia to the point she had to have the emergency T section.\n\nTake the risk I guess but yeah just in case people don't know the real risks of pre-eclampsia, that is my sister's.\n\nHe daughter was born 1lb 12 ounces and had a hole in her heart due to her early birth. She lived and my sister was diagnosed with anxiety and depression over her hospital experience and this was her first birth. She still has issues when she never did before and my sister gave birth in 2015. So years later and she still has the mental trauma from what she went through.", "> If you're really up for promotion, then missing one trip shouldn't matter\n\nThis is highly dependent on industry and company.", "How is he supposed to validate her feelings when he can't even talk to her because she ignores him and wont speak to him to talk through this?", "Doctors aren\u2019t always right on that due date. At 35 weeks my dr said there wasn\u2019t any sign I would go into labor and my water broke that night, baby born a few hours later (and they even were trying to slow my labor down). Thankfully you are now home and your wife didn\u2019t go into labor or have a medical event. It\u2019s time to apologize for invalidating her feelings and assure her you will be there for her AS WELL AS actually be there for her - listen, make joint decisions, put her first. NTA. - but you will be a AH if you pick work over her again. Work will always be there\u2026 and so would the guilt if your wife had a medical incident and you weren\u2019t there OR had the baby and you weren\u2019t there.", "If I were you I would not tell your wife that your mom thinks that she is overreacting. That\u2019s a way to blow up their relationship.", "Yep. Same thing happened with my sister. Literally overnight her healthy pregnancy turned into a T section birth at 6.5 months.", "Yeah but a business trip takes planning, so there was at least a week and likely longer where he was telling her he was doing it. If he was dismissing her feelings then as he\u2019s doing here then he\u2019s TA and it\u2019s no wonder she is pissed off and doesn\u2019t want to talk for a bit. \nIt\u2019s not a case of \u2018hey I did this thing\u2019 and then you can\u2019t explain. It\u2019s \u2018in going to do this thing\u2019 weeks of \u2018well I\u2019m doing it regardless\u2019 and now \u2018it\u2019s already done, why are you so upset\u2019", "A promotion wont always be there, though.", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about his workplace lmao.", "How many promotions is she missing out on now and into the future? He can miss a meeting to be there for his wife.", "Preach sis. I\u2019ve had 3. First was high risk. Too dramatic imo. She\u2019s got someone there and worst case you call an ambulance and he comes back.", "What an awful take lmao. \n\nHis feelings still matter and he can talk to his mom about his feelings AND talk to his wife about hers. Most humans have the capacity to be concerned about more than one thing at a time, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve not figured out how to do that yet."]}
