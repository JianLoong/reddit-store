Talk to her & find out why she needed your company & be there for her emotionally, as it will be important going forward.

She\u2019s had a high pregnancy already and the fact that your mother also thinks she\u2019s being unreasonable is a good insight into why your wife doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s a good support person.

I had my son at 33 weeks and if my partner had been away on a non obligatory thing I\u2019d ask him not go to on I would\u2026 not have been happy. Being pregnant can be scary and lonely and it\u2019s not something you can just take a two days away from.

Neither one of them are in the wrong because op getting a promotion is beneficial for the whole family while she is already high risk and super hormonal and is probably feeling scared and alone as well as cut off from the world as I\u2019m sure she\u2019s on a lot of bed rest, not to mention mortality rates for women in the US(assuming that\u2019s where they are) is quite high.

He's calling her unreasonable when the issues that can arise from pre-eclampsia and diabetes are very serious and she is absolutely right to be terrified right now. This is her 1st pregnancy. I don't think he's TA because he went, I think he's TA for invalidating her terrifying reality, and leaving her feeling abandoned and like she was wrong for those feelings. \n\nI 1000% agree they need to talk about it, but he needs to first come at it by validating her feelings.

The reality is that he doesn\u2019t understand her feelings but based off the comments is at least trying, he doesn\u2019t understand how it feels when your emotions are elevated 10 fold with pregnancy so seems to not be grasping how much this affected her, he probably believes she was just a little scared or nervous and doesn\u2019t realize how those emotions can be overwhelming while pregnant. If he refused to work on this at all and think his wife just needs to calm or something alone those lines, it would definitely make him an AH but OPs comments show that while he may not understand, he is willing to apologize and try to sit down with her to understand and figure this out.

Pregnancy is a risk every single time and once you hit that 30+ week mark, anything can happen. \n\nIn our house, my partner travels, when I was pregnant with our first I asked he not travel in the last two months because anything could happen and to me, having him with me was more important than either of our jobs.

You cannot speak and resolve something with someone who will not speak to you and solving this problem should not just be op begging for forgiveness and agreeing with everything she said. People are not faucets and anyone in a healthy relationship should be able to sit down and speak about their problems, just because someone has hurt feelings does not mean they are in the right and the other person should just automatically do anything and everything to make it up to them. Punishing your partner for hurt feelings is childish and they both need to step up here. They are both feeling misunderstood and attacked and regardless of that, anything that causes real issues in a relationship is up to both people to find a solution together."]}
