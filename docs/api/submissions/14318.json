Talk to her & find out why she needed your company & be there for her emotionally, as it will be important going forward.

She\u2019s had a high pregnancy already and the fact that your mother also thinks she\u2019s being unreasonable is a good insight into why your wife doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s a good support person.

I had my son at 33 weeks and if my partner had been away on a non obligatory thing I\u2019d ask him not go to on I would\u2026 not have been happy. Being pregnant can be scary and lonely and it\u2019s not something you can just take a two days away from.

Neither one of them are in the wrong because op getting a promotion is beneficial for the whole family while she is already high risk and super hormonal and is probably feeling scared and alone as well as cut off from the world as I\u2019m sure she\u2019s on a lot of bed rest, not to mention mortality rates for women in the US(assuming that\u2019s where they are) is quite high.

At 32 weeks, she's in the home stretch and could, conceivably, end up with pre-eclampsia which could result in the need to induce quickly. She was scared that she'd enter the most difficult experience of her life without you there. And let me tell you - I had a relatively normal labor, and it was traumatic for me. I don't know how I would have gotten through it without my husband with me.

She felt abandoned and the healthy response isn't to justify the behavior that made her feel that way. He added fuel to her fire because he dismissed her. He justified over validate which isn't helpful and will absolutely shut a person down from wanting further communication because they aren't being heard. Especially if they have a past of being shut down in the same manner (her mother as an example). \n\nYou seem like you're taking this personal, you know cold shoulder doesnt mean silent treatment right? It means she is acting uncaring towards him, possibly monotone or not overly affectionate. \n\nYou can't kick a person in the leg then expect them to say sorry first for yelling in pain. He absolutely needs to act first because he's the one who made her feel that way, then dismissed it. She shut down because of him and it's absolutely up to him to make it right.\n\nIf he had done things correctly and she shut down that's a different issue but his actions caused her reactions. \n\nHis mother is still backing his side and encouraging his behavior. In front of her or not it's clearly going to be the pair of them againest her and she doesn't have a back up there with her. That has probably added to the shut down because she is alone with 2 people who are on the same side. The more I unpack, the more I can't blame her for shutting down."]}
