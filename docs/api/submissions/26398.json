Resist the temptation? That's on that guy. Is like I'm saying \"I couldn't resist to cheat on my gf with that girl, she was awesome\". That doesn't sound right at all lmao", "NTA - but I'd have serious doubts about your husband now. He doesn't seem ethical and it sounds like he thinks cheating is acceptable.", "Oops sorry my penis just entered your vagina, I have no idea how it got there. NTA but your bf has made it clear he's a sexist with his argument.", "NTA, guy was def in control of the situation and could have removed himself from it so that he wouldn\u2019t have had sex with her. Seems like it should\u2019ve been easy to say no and then leave if she became pushy, but I\u2019m betting she didn\u2019t have to push much at all. Your husband defending a cheater would make me suspicious about him as well.", "NTA - you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sure if you spun it the other way around and had someone egging *you* on for sex your husband would be singing a different tune than \u201chow could you resist\u201d\n\nJ could have ended the conversation. He could have said the egging on made him uncomfortable. He could have brought a friend with. He could have just left.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget that *J made a joke about it* He wasn\u2019t exactly trying to prevent anything here", "How could J resist?  Uh, how about by being a decent person.  NTA but your husband is.  No wonder you were triggered.  Hope he doesn't run into one of his ex's.", "Likely you been cheated on already if your husband\u2019s stance is that is okay if you cannot resist", "NTA and I would be just as worried as you are about your husband's response. I don't care if she answered the door completely naked, he cheated.  He made that choice and is responsible for his actions, period.", "NTA - cheating is cheating and once a cheater, always a cheater.  There is never an excuse for cheating.  Your husband just handed you a red flag when he said that J is not totally at fault and that K kept encouraging it.  Ask him, if he was in the same situation as J, would HE have cheated on YOU with K?", "Missing a lot of context here but yeah there\u2019s not many situations where you\u2019re not at fault for cheating lmao. NTA", "NTA - if you're in a committed relationship (J is/was), then have the decency and respect for your partner not to be tempted to stray no matter how strong the temptation. J should have immediately put an end to K's advances, (he shouldn't have even joked about anything sexual with K in the first place to prompt her to make her advances on him), and in failing to stop her advances he should have promptly took his stuff and just left immediately. The fact that he failed to not make the sexual joke(s) in the first place, the fact that he did not reject her advances thoroughly, and the fact that he did not remove himself from the situation until it was already too late shows that some part of him wanted this to happen and he does not care what kind of hurt/pain he causes his current partner H nor have respect enough for her that he would resist any and all temptations. If J has any shred of decency and respect left, he owes it to H to tell her the truth that he cheated on her and to either earn her forgiveness/trust (if she's even willing to give him a second chance) or learn from his failures/mistakes and move on. J sounds like HITA. and your husband sounds kinda HITA for siding with J. Cheating is NOT ever ok, it is extremely disrespectful and hurtful to your current partner.\n\nIf there is something lacking in the current relationship that is resulting in a temptation of either partner to cheat, then it needs to be communicated and worked on as a team effort, maybe even couples therapy or something is needed. If after communication, effort and/or couples therapy is still not fixing the relationship then both persons should understand that the relationship isn't working and they have to split and move on (else it's just toxic).", "They're both at fault. I'm assuming K knew J had a new girlfriend. No matter how tempting, J should have more respect and love for his new girlfriend. Both of them suck.", "NTA I'd be suspicious of my partner if they were supporting someone who cheated, J is at fault as he could've easily told K that it wasn't going to happen he had a girlfriend now and if she persisted removed himself from that situation he didn't have to do it, she didn't force him to do it, he chose to do it.", "INFO Did K know J was in a relationship? If so both K and J are in the wrong.", "NTA. J is in a relationship. He was wrong for opening the door to the subject but K didn\u2019t force him to continue to walk through the door. She should have known better too but it isn\u2019t at all difficult to say no.", "NTA  I take it K is single? So the only cheater here is J. The claim that your bf is trying to make that men cannot control themselves if a woman is interested in sex with them and therefore they have no responsibility of their actions is sexist bullshit. He CHOSE to cheat, no one made him. He's a cheater and I'm surprised your bf isn't doing more to convince you he's different from J.", "NTA, but this would concern me if it was my husband's view of things.  So your husband would not totally be at fault if he cheated on you because the other person was encouraging it?  I would make it clear that if he does that, divorce will be on the table.  Make it clear that is  a line in the sand.", "Your husband is gonna (or has) cheat and blame you.  I'd put money on it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Anyone who tries to absolve a cheater of blame is automatically an asshole. And, unfortunately, may \"justify\" cheating himself. Both of your friends are at fault.", "J is at fault here", "NTA.  If J can't be blamed for giving in at the end, then it must have been his responsibility to avoid putting himself in a situation that was past the point of no return in the first place.  What's your husband's view on that?", "ESH they both suck. The ex knowingly slept with someone in a relationship. The friend decided to cheat. Stop trying to grand stand when both of your friends suck.", "NTA.\n\nActions have outcomes. Unless K has the ability to control the minds and actions of others, this is entirely on J to have said no. Heck, J shouldn't have even make the joke in the first place so in a sense, \"he started it\".\n\nSeparately though, you are an AH for using initials instead of made up names in your post. In your head, you easily replace those initials with the people you know. To us, they're just single letters and it makes it far more difficult to keep track of who's who.", ">since J is in a committed relationship with someone else, he is at fault and should have been able to resist temptation with K and use his better judgement.

You Pay ... they are both at fault.\n\nJust make up with your husband, don't let their sillinesss steal your husband's love.", "Ignore stupid moves by your friends and focus on your relationship. You might want to have a discussion about his stance on fidelity within a marriage and outside of it. YA all being TA. Don't fight about something that has nothing to do with you.", "ESH, first I want to clarify the only reason OP sucks because she defending her friend by saying she don't have any fault in this where in reality she just as fault for hitting on a guy while knowing he taking. Now the guy is at fault to for not saying no and not removing himself from the situation which leads to him cheating on his girlfriend. Now your husband sucks just by defending his friend. Truthfully both you and your husband is extremely bias in this whole thing trying put blame on one person and not the other but reality is both is to blame.", "J is definitely TA here.

At any point, he could have extracted himself from the situation. (Under a reasonable assumption that there was nothing preventing him from leaving.)

Your husband should put some space to J too if J thinks cheating is ok.", "No. Stop that shit, even joking. The only thing different is the audacity"]}
