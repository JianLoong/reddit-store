J should have immediately put an end to K's advances, (he shouldn't have even joked about anything sexual with K in the first place to prompt her to make her advances on him), and in failing to stop her advances he should have promptly took his stuff and just left immediately. The fact that he failed to not make the sexual joke(s) in the first place, the fact that he did not reject her advances thoroughly, and the fact that he did not remove himself from the situation until it was already too late shows that some part of him wanted this to happen and he does not care what kind of hurt/pain he causes his current partner H nor have respect enough for her that he would resist any and all temptations. If J has any shred of decency and respect left, he owes it to H to tell her the truth that he cheated on her and to either earn her forgiveness/trust (if she's even willing to give him a second chance) or learn from his failures/mistakes and move on. J sounds like HITA. and your husband sounds kinda HITA for siding with J. Cheating is NOT ever ok, it is extremely disrespectful and hurtful to your current partner.\n\nIf there is something lacking in the current relationship that is resulting in a temptation of either partner to cheat, then it needs to be communicated and worked on as a team effort, maybe even couples therapy or something is needed.

That this is just one big misunderstanding about where the other one actually stands.", "Murder is purposeful, manslaughter is by accident. Cheating is always on purpose. Even if they didn't seek it out, they still chose to cheat. No matter what opportunity comes up, someone can always stay loyal to their partner. There is a huge difference between your examples because cheating is always a choice while manslaughter is an accident.", "The difference between the 2 is intent. Cheating is intentional.", "The difference is whether you intended to kill someone, not whether you planned it. The friend didn't cheat through carelessness.", "It literally does mean that party didn't cheat.\n\nA single person can't cheat. They've broken no promises.", "You could say the same about Murder vs. Manslaughter though. \"Regardless of the minutia, he still kolled someone.\" We as a society think you are less at fault if you kill someone accidentally or in the heat of passion than when you do it in cold blood.", "But, but but... I tripped on the carpet, and my dick popped out and she was in this dress with no underwear on, and I just... well... fell *IN*...", "maybe she tripped and he accidently ipaled her with his penis.  /s", "Manslaughter is not always an accident. You can kill someone on purpose but still only be guilty of manslaughter.", "But its not. Killing in the heat of passion is intentional amd can still be manslaughter.", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/crime_of_passion", "By roles reversed she meant if it were a guy egging on us ex gf and she caved under pressure.", "exactly my thoughts.  if some girl throws herself on me it\u2019s not MY failt if we have sex.  like men can\u2019t control themselves at all.  \nvery concerning really", "Disagree. Only one person cheated on another individual in this case. And in doing that disregarded any hurt they were about to cause their partner.  That's what makes him worse imo.\n\nBoth shitty, but only one person's actions hurt someone they are meant to care about.", "If I help a fellow student with the answers during a test, I\u2019m also a cheater.  Just because I know the answers, doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t cheating.  \n\nThe definition of cheating is acting dishonestly.  How is the single person not equally part of that?\n\nI don\u2019t give the single person a free pass just because they\u2019re single.  They are equally partners in the act of cheating\u2026especially if they knew about the SO.", "When it comes to taking a life, that kind of nuance matters. We're talking about infidelity. The standards are not the same.", "Way to defy the laws of physics...", "I'm always surprised by how often that seems to happen. People are so clumsy. Especially when they're not wearing underwear. You'd think they'd take more care when going commando.", "You can end up pleading it down but that's an entirely different matter.", "Even if manslaughter isn't always an accident, there's still no such thing as cheating on accident. A dick doesn't accidentally slip into someone's vagina.", "No, I mean, legally. The difference is in one case you decided and set out to commit a murder that day and how you would go about murdering. In the other, you were just living your life and then you killed someone.", "Even so, he still cheated. He made the choice to get naked and have sex with someone that wasn't his partner. He absolutely could've chosen not to have sex with them. Even if there was encouragement he still could've said no.", "Why is taking a life something we should take less seriously than cheating?", "No. Atleast in many states, a crime of passion is manslaughter. https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/crime_of_passion", "Isn't that exactly what happened here though. Op's friend didn't set out to cheat.", "I'm sorry, I think I missed something. When did I say taking a life was less serious?", "Yeah, bc they're basically using a \"crime of passion\" as a self-defense explanation. The article explains that charges can be dropped to manslaughter if the defendant was responding to serious provocation, like getting physically assaulted. Verbal assault is not considered serious enough provocation. \n\nSo, essentially, if you accidentally kill someone bc you are responding to being beaten to death, yeah, in some cases the charges may be dropped to manslaughter bc it's not always reasonable to expect ppl to, well, act reasonable when they're being assaulted. In the act of defending yourself, it is quite possible to accidentally kill the person attacking you.", "But he still chose to cheat. Yeah he didn't actively look for it but when he had an opportunity he decided to cheat. You're comparing two different things. Manslaughter is by accident, that's what makes it manslaughter, you can't accidentally cheat. Getting naked and having sex are choices, that can't happen on accident.", "What were the extenuating circumstances that led to his loss of control? Like, there was nothing impairing him from making a sound decision. He decided to cheat. How is that not intentional?", "I think that the ultimate logic behind what you're saying no? When a person ends another person's life we should take in to account the circumstances of why they did so, but cheating on someone you are 100% the bad guy no matter what?", "No Manslaughter can also be a crime of passion. You didn't plan it ahead of time but were provoked into acting.", "You're putting words in my mouth now.\n\nFirstly, please explain your logic, how does taking in the circumstances regarding murder mean I'm taking it less seriously? \n\nSecondly, at no point did i suggest or imply anyone was '100% the bad guy no matter what'. How did you ever make that leap of faith?", "Yes actually. Because cheating is a choice. They can always say no to any opportunity. Killing someone on accident is not a purposeful choice but regardless of circumstances, the person chooses whether or  not to cheat.", "Yes.", "\u201cProvoked\u201d as in \u201cpushed to a place where any reasonable person would lose control of their actions\u201d lol. This is a really strange story to us to make your initial point. Anything that might distinguish murder from manslaughter just ain\u2019t here friend.", "Your point was that nuance matters when it comes to taking a life but not cheating. So you definitely implied the second point. And why would be unable to take nuance into account with cheating ither than if you are valuing that as more serious than taking a life?"]}
