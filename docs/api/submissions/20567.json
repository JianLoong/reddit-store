It's pretty disrespectful if they are still together and he is involved (other than this time if he genuinely couldn't take her).", "NTA for suggesting that baby-daddy do it, but the term \"baby-daddy\" can be degrading and some will absolutely take it to be insulting. If she dislikes the term and finds it offensive, use his name, it's really not that hard. And if she's someone you love and care about, calling him by his name for the sake of her feelings is the respectful and loving thing to do.", "NTA\n\nNothing you said was untrue. He IS the baby-daddy. I'm married and when my kid was born I was referred to that way all the time. It's what I AM", "I think it's because at one time baby daddy was used to refer to a man who got a woman pregnant but was no longer in a relationship with the mother.  The same way baby mama was a way a man referenced the mother of his child he was not in a relationship with. Both terms originally had negative connotations but now not so much.  \n\nNTA.  And how much slack do pregnant women get these days? You'd think pregnant woman nowadays are goddesses who are gracing the world with their spawn.  Sheesh.", "The term can have negative connotations and it probs made her uncomfortable because of that.

She's asking you for help, so either help or don't. Have a proper conversation if you're concerned. Don't just put down their relationship.\n\nEdit: To clarify meaning, I don't think baby-daddy is necessarily a negative term like some other commenters are saying, but it definitely means \"the dad of my baby\" and the whole point of the term is when mum and dad are NOT in a relationship, as otherwise you'd just say boyfriend, husband, partner, etc. \n\nSo, using it to describe your kid's dad who you are separated from but have a great coparenting relationship with is correct, and fine, not rude. However, using it to describe someone's romantic partner that they're having a child with is not correct and you would only say it with the intention of being rude and implying you don't respect the relationship.", "That's a touchy one.

You\u2019re right.", "I think that's the point, similar to straight folks using \"partner\" to allow lgbtq folks some degree of privacy using partner if they want to, rather than that being the thing that outs them to strangers, if that makes sense.", "Yuppp", "Exactly, I\u2019m a little shocked at how many people are just completely accepting this racially-loaded phrase without hesitation.", "Turns out this dude's not involved much so he's definitely the baby-daddy.", ">I always thought it was a term only used for a man who was the father of the kid but not in a relationship with the mother\n\nThat's what I've always understood it to mean as well. As a relationship descriptor, \"baby-daddy\" would imply the only relationship two people have is through the child. Like, you wouldn't call your brother \"my dad's son\" unless you were specifically trying to say that you do not view him as your brother and the only connection between you is your father.", "[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baby%20daddy#:\\~:text=slang,up%20to%20a%20new%20girlfriend](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baby%20daddy#:~:text=slang,up%20to%20a%20new%20girlfriend).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>slang\r  \n: the biological father of a woman's child\r  \nespecially : one who is not married to or in a long-term, intimate relationship with the child's mother\r  \nNear the end, a very pregnant Sara watches as her baby daddy cozies up to a new girlfriend.\n\nYeah, I can see someone taking offense to this term.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one lol. Maybe it\u2019s a british thing these days? I thought it was an Americanism that started being said here (UK) too", "So OP obviously used it as an insult, and is upset that it was taken as an insult. That\u2019s what makes it YTA for me.\n\nIt\u2019s also kinda wild for me that OP is using the fact that sister is asking for help getting to appointments as seemingly the only evidence that he\u2019s not involved. Not all jobs are accommodating for OB visits, especially as they get more frequent toward the end of the pregnancy. It\u2019s probably more important that he save his available PTO (if he\u2019s lucky enough to have any) for when the baby gets here. There\u2019s just so many potential explanations. \n\nAnd as if being able to provide transportation to OB visits is the only mark of an involved dad??\n\nJust feels kinda judgmental and gross.", ">she's asking everyone else to help her all the time\n\nOP said it's not just this one transportation issue. And if you've ever had a friend or relative who is in a relationship, but is constantly and frequently leaning on everyone else for support on things that a romantic partner should be contributing to, eventually it does get draining.", "I'm gonna be honest, it sounds like you were from your comments.", "Something else being\u2026.? Something stupid like video games or drugs or friends? Or something like work?\n\nEdited to add: also, what kind of BF is he to her?", "I don\u2019t see it as an insult. \n\nIn her case, she\u2019s irritated because everyone is doing for this baby, but the father. His lack of involvement has now turned into other people being responsible for his child. I\u2019d be pissed too!", "Not everyone\u2019s work schedules are so accommodating. My OB is only open til 4 Monday through Thursday. I\u2019m a teacher. I\u2019m lucky to be on summer break at the moment, but when I go back to school I will have to have other people cover my last period just to get there in time for afternoon appointments.\n\nIf my husband was in the same position, I wouldn\u2019t want him to use up his PTO before the birth. He wouldn\u2019t suddenly be an \u201cuninvolved\u201d dad if I needed my mom or dad to help me get to those appointments.", "Depends entirely on what he does for work, if he has a long commute, etc. etc. People are real eager to call this man who OP has given extremely little information about lazy, a deadbeat, uninvolved, etc. just because they\u2019re having a transportation issue right now.\n\nI do not know where this unearned hate is coming from. The most we have to go on is the fact that OP was irritated by being asked twice by her sister. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re so heated about. \n\n(Also, hypothetically, if OP\u2019s sister didn\u2019t want to drive him to work - why would that still make the boyfriend the lazy one???)", "Even in couples that have been married for years they aren\u2019t always available 100% of the time. The gf has a support system that she can ask around if they can take her to the appointment if her bf isn\u2019t available at that time.", "I have a friend who is still legally married to 1 guy and having her 2nd child with a different guy.  He doesn't have a job and is an absolute ass.  She refers to him as her fianc\u00e9 (how when she's still married to someone else with no plans for divorce idk but ) everyone else calls him deadbeat baby daddy.  They live together but he ain't a partner and family and friends pick up his slack.", "Not impacted *now*.  And if what one is saying is factual, the judgment is good, whether one likes it or not.\n\nAnyway, baby-daddy = father.  Where's the insult?", "And you said no to the ride.\nNo one is questioning that.", "Never said it replaces anything. My real life experience is how I said I\u2019ve experienced it lol. \n\nAgree it could be regional. \nAnd I\u2019m 44, hear plenty of people half my age using it the way I have heard it. \n\nThere\u2019s a distinction between \u201cthe baby\u2019s daddy\u201d and \u201cbaby daddy\u201d. \n\nBut that\u2019s not what we are here for :)", "I still stand by my NTA. He earned that title by not taking his pregnant woman to the doctor. He needs to step it up. Maybe when he does, he\u2019ll earn more respect.", "My dad or a taxi. My dad lives with me.", "What could you possibly mean by this", "Given the response of the sister I don't fully trust OP as a narrator, plus that OP left out that her sister always needs help until people pointed that one time isn't much in the comments.", "No matter the term used, the implication is there that the person who should be more responsible isn\u2019t being responsible enough. \u201cCan\u2019t Dave do it?\u201d is the same thing.", "OP says that they have been asking others to help with everything and are even upset at the idea of the BD helping with things like this\u2026", "I understand, but I wasn't intending it as an insult. More like genuinely questioning why he can't do it.", "I don't know. Probably mixture of work and friends.", "The people she was speaking to did though.\n\nIf someone uses a racial slurs and insists they don't see it as insult, it's still insulting to the people who hear it.\n\nIf she has an issue with the bf she should say that rather than making snide insults.", "She's not the asshole for asking why dad can't bring her , but she is TA for not saying \"oh , I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend\" in the moment. \nIt is offensive to *some* people. The person she said it to *was* offended.  Just say sorry and move on.", "And no one is saying she\u2019s an AH for saying no. **But taking it out on the boyfriend was the AH move and only escalated things way beyond what was necessary.** Set a boundary with your sister, ya know the person who wouldn\u2019t accept your no for an answer, and don\u2019t just start insulting people who aren\u2019t even part of the conversation??", "She literally said she couldn't do it this time. She said no. Her no wasn't accepted and stepsister gave her a hard time about it. Why is the BABY'S LITERAL DADDY able to use work as an excuse but the baby's STEP-AUNT is not?? Bad take, Diligently Awkward.", "Yes, sometimes they're not, but normally you rely on a spouse more than a boyfriend. \nMy point isn't that their relationship isn't stable. Just saying that op wasn't saying baby daddy to mean that they aren't in a relationship. People have different ideas of what the term implies.", "Maybe him and her should figure it the fuck out then, yeah?", "The racial overtones of the term, that the previous commenter mentioned", "Definitely not regional. I'm from New England and it's used to describe people who simply aren't a part of the other parents life, sometimes the kid too.", "But OP is apparently using available transportation as the only criteria for whether he\u2019s \u201cinvolved\u201d or not. Which is kind of mind boggling.", "Even if it\u2019s accurate, it\u2019s rude to say. Tell them you can\u2019t take them and then mind your business", "You a \"facts don't care about your feelings\" kinda person?", "> It\u2019s not an AH move if you know what it means *and the meaning applies*.\n\nI don't quite understand that logic. Being an AH is not about being correct. If you were to refer to an obese man as \"that fat guy over there\" instead of just \"that man over there\", you'd be an asshole even though the meaning applies. Similarly, choosing to refer to him as \"baby daddy\" rather than his name/your partner/the father or any other just as correct term knowing its connotation seems like an AH move to me.", "Available transportation is not the only marker of an involved parent tho. And OP is using the term to imply that he\u2019s not an involved parent.", "If you don\u2019t know, then YTA and disrespectful. You don\u2019t even know him well enough to tell us if he\u2019s mostly doing work stuff or if it\u2019s leisure time so yeah disrespectful considering he is still around. \n\nFor all we know, he could be working most of that time trying to save money for his first kid. My partner missed stuff because he was working hard because having our eldest made him extremely anxious as a provider and people judged the hell out of him for it. If you have a normally developing baby, these appointments can be tedious and not everyone places the same amount of importance on \u201cfirsts\u201d. I can\u2019t tell you how many OB appts I went to alone or driven by someone else and everyone else made it into a bigger deal than it was. \n\nOf course there the possibility he doesn\u2019t give a fuck, but for the sake of not knowing BF\u2019s side and knowing he\u2019s at least stuck around til this point, I\u2019m gonna give him benefit of the doubt for the time being", "Do not make this about race. Jfc smh", "They should also take her first NO as the answer and not pressed. She has ZERO obligations to that child or her stepsister. She didn\u2019t pick any of them to be in her life.", "So you insult someone not part of the conversation?\n\nIf OP has an issue with the stepsister, she should address it with her not attack her boyfriend.", "It\u2019s okay to ask. It\u2019s okay to ask more than once. It\u2019s okay to say no. It\u2019s take a shitty person to insult someone asking for help in a circumstance like this. Terrible take, Notwastingtimeiswear", "Yeah and when someone tells you a term is offensive, you try not to use it around them or apply it to them.\n\nWithin reason, of course.", "Well OP should just apologize if she hasn\u2019t already to her sister because she was hurt by the comment.", "The OP has said in a comment that the bf is not involved that much in the pregnancy and the comment wasn\u2019t meant as rude but as a very valid question about why it fell to her to help his pregnant partner rather than him step up to be there for her. I don\u2019t see it as unnecessary but rather a concerned comment from a sister worried about the lack of support she has from the baby\u2019s other parent.", "What\u2019s your problem? The bf could just have work hours that aren\u2019t flexible and can\u2019t really be changed. I\u2019m assuming that the bf has taken his gf to some appointments. Lastly, why the hostility? Grow Up.", "I'm not I'm using an example of an insult.", "I don't see any one saying OP is an AH for saying no.\n\nBut the question we are judging is 'is OP an AH for saying baby daddy '.\n\nShe is", "It is not actually okay to ask once the answer is no. What the actual fuck.", "If she wants to keep the peace, sure. \nBut it's not that offensive..", "I said previously, he could other serious commitments that can\u2019t be pushed back. \nEx. His work just might not have flexible hours.", "Because you are arguing a ridiculous point that doesn\u2019t really have much to do with whether or not she\u2019s the AH. If the SS has a partner he can take her. Period. You making excuses that are all hypothetical and IRRELEVANT to OPs life is ridiculous. You should grow up since you can\u2019t seem to think past step one.", "Of course it is. If I ask a family member, they say no, I ask others, they say no, depending on what my family member is doing, I would absolutely ask them again.", "From your perspective it\u2019s not that offensive but to OPs sister it is. Even though I\u2019m assuming OP would know how her sister would react to the word she should still apologize.", "Right. But OP has said in comments he\u2019s not involved and she\u2019s being asked to do more than just taking her to appointments. In fact she said the sister is asking for help \u201call the time\u201d so unless he works 24/7 at some point he is choosing to not be involved.", "Fine if you want my opinion on OP she\u2019s the AH because she offended her sister with a term her sister found derogatory. OP should say sorry that\u2019s all I think she should do.", "Yeah no, why is one no not enough, that you have to hear no twice? You sound like a really obnoxious family member, and god knows I have a lot of em", " I looked at most of OP responses I don\u2019t remember OP saying anything to that effect. Either way I still firmly believe that OP should just apologize. Unless the bf was a complete deadbeat than I think OP should just apologize for causing her sister to be even more stressed than she already is.", "There you go! Good job!"]}
