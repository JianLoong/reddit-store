He IS the baby-daddy. I'm married and when my kid was born I was referred to that way all the time. It's what I AM", "I think it's because at one time baby daddy was used to refer to a man who got a woman pregnant but was no longer in a relationship with the mother.  The same way baby mama was a way a man referenced the mother of his child he was not in a relationship with. Both terms originally had negative connotations but now not so much.  \n\nNTA.  And how much slack do pregnant women get these days? You'd think pregnant woman nowadays are goddesses who are gracing the world with their spawn.  Sheesh.", "The term can have negative connotations and it probs made her uncomfortable because of that.

Don't just put down their relationship.\n\nEdit: To clarify meaning, I don't think baby-daddy is necessarily a negative term like some other commenters are saying, but it definitely means \"the dad of my baby\" and is the whole point of the term is when mum and dad are NOT in a relationship, as otherwise you'd just say boyfriend, husband, partner, etc. \n\nSo, using it to describe your kid's dad who you are separated from but have a great coparenting relationship with is correct, and fine, not rude. However, using it to describe someone's romantic partner that they're having a child with is not correct and you would only say it with the intention of being rude and implying you don't respect the relationship.", "That's a touchy one.

If a family member is repeatedly picking up the slack then yes.", "So does OP. Why is his job an excuse but not OPs?", "If they have one car she can drop him off at work and then drive to her appointment, or is that too much bother for baby daddy?", "Lots of people dating don't live together. Ons never live together. Of course some change their minds when they have a baby, but some coparent until they can. It's just different than a married couple that has lived together for years. I don't think of a baby daddy as being uninvolved, I just think of him (not always correctly) as being not as accessible 24/7. \nThat's part of the reason I think the guy in this story fits more into that category. I'm not saying he's not a good partner, but he's simply not always around to help.", "Think of it like- if they're going to coparent or have lived together for years. Lots of people dating don't live together, same obv with ons. Of course, some choose to after having a baby but some don't. I think of it a lot more about living situation/ marital status than if he's around or not.", "This. Honestly people are very quick to jump to the conclusion that dad is a deadbeat with no evidence to suggest that", "I asked my partner not to come to our second child's appointments (except 1) as I knew he should save time off for when I would be recovering with an infant dependent on me. If you don't want to help, just don't? But no need for unnecessary comments.", "I would refer to him as that because I don\u2019t have the same connotation of \u201cbaby daddy\u201d in my head as you do yours.", "I have a job too.", "Most people make arrangements for dr appts all the time who have jobs. Nice try tho. Smh", "Obviously I cannot speak for people who downvoted without comment, but in general AITA tends to have a mindset that you should never have to apologize for unintentionally offending/hurting someone, as if the lack of intent on your part means that their hurt is invalid.", "The sister is standing up for her bf. OP just called her bf a term that she believes is derogatory. OP should just say sorry to her sister.", "Agree on NTA. But google doesn't replace real life experience. It's possible that the difference is regional and generational.", "Seriously. Bad situation", "No, that's my vibe too. I always heard it in context of like \"Shes got three babydaddies\" or \"the baby daddy just took off when she said she was pregnant\". I know my family is SUPER judgmental about these things, but it was always used in a very very negative context when I was growing up, and the few times I've heard it in a neutral (or factual or even positive)  context  it sounded weird and off.", "ooooh! gotcha! (I\u2019m not native in English but) I didn\u2019t know this at all \u2026 i thought it\u2019s just a cute name to refer to the Daddy of the baby when you talk to a woman who\u2019s pregnant or has a baby and well \u2026 to make it clear you are not referring to the woman\u2019s daddy\u2026. lol", "I'm used to calling those sperm donors.", "Yeah, sounds like OP knew exactly the connotations that the term implied and used it anyway... Therefore AH.", "Was OP working when she was asked for a favor? If she was working or had to work later, she could have said no. If she wasn\u2019t working but had other plans, that\u2019s still fine, say no. Sister was asking a favor, not demanding a ride. It\u2019s okay to say no for any reason, but it\u2019s not okay to insult your pregnant sister because she needs help. Most 23 year olds don\u2019t have access to a job that offers unlimited time off for someone else\u2019s doctors appointment or a livable age. If he was working, taking off for her appointment may not be possible.", "I think that\u2019s a very limited view of the world- People have a lot of different relationship and living situations that others may not be privy too- people who decide not to marry, people who work abroad, people who live separately for legal, financial or family reasons etc. I would never think to give somebody a label that they or their partner aren\u2019t comfortable with; and I would never use the term \u201cbaby daddy\u201d in general.", "It\u2019s a dick move by OP like just say sorry it\u2019s one fucking word.", "She did say no \ud83d\ude05 the stepsister didn\u2019t take no for an answer and asked again. It\u2019s in the post, I don\u2019t understand why so many people are skimming over that.", "Jumping in because I get what they mean and I absolutely wouldn't use the term baby daddy here BUT I don't see it as inherently negative, it just has a specific meaning. It's only negative due to context. It can be a term of endearment even! But it doesn't describe someone you're in a relationship with.", "And you'd be perfectly justified in not being able to give a ride for that reason", "Maybe he couldn\u2019t make the arrangements. Ever think of that.", "That\u2019s how you tell if they\u2019re socially inept.", "Maybe the sister should be more worried about his level of involvement rather than semantics.", "I'm in the USA, born and raised. I'm not used to it being used negatively. But I am Generation X, and from NYC. So I think the difference is generational and regional.", "But if it's accurate?", "It\u2019s not an AH move if you know what it means *and the meaning applies*. Also as the baby daddy isn\u2019t offended himself it\u2019s clearly NTA. If the truth hurts the cousins feelings the issue isn\u2019t the truth, but her not wanting to deal with that", "If they don't want to be called that, that's fine! I'm not going around labeling people or trying to put their relationship in a box. Just saying that op probably didn't mean baby daddy to mean they weren't in a solid relationship. People have varying definitions for the term.", "We don\u2019t know why the bf can\u2019t take his gf to some of the appointments I\u2019m assuming work just isn\u2019t that flexible for him. OPs comment was still rude and unnecessary and should just apologize."]}
