Our bedroom is right off the living room, so anytime guests come over I can hear everything outside of our door and it disturbs my sleep. I told my husband her coming by at that time is not ideal for me, that I really value my weekend mornings and my rest. So they started to go out together when she wants to come by, which I thought was a good compromise.\n\nThere are other times she wants to drop by when she\u2019s in our neighborhood for church, and we\u2019ve had to say no because the timing was just really inconvenient for us. We both work from home and sometimes when she and her family want to come by it\u2019s during work hours. We don\u2019t always say no, but lately it seems like more no\u2019s than yes\u2019s.\n\nTurns out she told my husband and my MIL that she feels offended and not welcome in our home because I don\u2019t spend time with her whenever she decides to drop in, and that we can never accommodate them when they\u2019re in our neighborhood. I\u2019d like to point out we are rarely ever  in their neighborhood, and would only go to their house if they invited us.\n\nAITA for setting a boundary around times I am willing to hang out and have family/guests over?\n\nEdited to add: This Sunday school falls on Saturdays lol, I wrote Sunday school so people could more easily understand the concept of what I was talking about.\n\nAlso adding that I do see this SIL often, at least 2x/month outside of her drop ins, for one reason or another. I see someone in my in laws family almost weekly since they are all local, and they\u2019re a big family. My family is not local so we only see them when planning ahead for weekends or out of town visits. \n\nI\u2019ve also tried to hang out with this SIL directly and am often met with avoidance or non-committal responses.", "created_utc": 1684309152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13juvek/aita_for_not_entertaining_my_sil_when_she_comes/", "score": 1413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
