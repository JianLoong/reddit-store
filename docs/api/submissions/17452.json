I\u2019ve also asked my husband numerous times to install a door in our hallway entrance to buffer the noise, but he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nShe still comes by in the evenings, sometimes unannounced, and I do hang out with her then. We definitely see each other at least 2x/month if not more.\n\nAlso, she still does come by in the mornings sometimes, and hangs out in the house.
