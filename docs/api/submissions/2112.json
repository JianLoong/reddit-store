It turned out dad poured a bucket of ice water on her while she was in the shower. Another time I walked out to my car and found it missing.

I love dad but sometimes it\u2019s exhausting living with him.\n\nMy older sis Jessie (24f) lives out of state. A month ago, she told us she\u2019s coming to visit and bringing home her boyfriend David (I don\u2019t know his age but he looks to be in his older 20s) for us to meet him. Jessie usually likes the pretty boys who wears polo shirts and are around 6 feet tall (this is important, trust me). When dad heard about it, he was so excited he couldn\u2019t hold it in. He ran out and bought the hottest hot sauce he could find. He showed it off to me and mom and told us he\u2019s going to make a special plate for David. Of course I told my sis but she told me not to worry about it.\n\nWhen she came home last night and David walked through the door, we were all shocked. David is a little shorter than sis and a full head shorter than dad. He looks like someone shaved a pit bull and forced it into a sports jacket. I\u2019m not talking about the cute ones you see running downstairs and taking showers with their owners. He looks like someone stuck him into a blender and he won. When he went to shake hands with dad, I can see David had wider shoulders, bigger hands, and his forearms was 2x as big. I could also see and was staring at this scar on the back of his hands and ran up pass the sleeve of his dress shirt.\n\nDinner rolls around and David compliments mom on her cooking, which surprised me. I asked if he really likes it he said yes. Sis and I looked at each other and we instantly knew dad didn\u2019t spike David\u2019s meal. I asked dad if David got the right plate or if there was a mix up. Then I told David dad had prepared a special plate for him. Dad\u2019s face turned bright red and he told me to eat my dinner. Of course I didn\u2019t so I said I\u2019ll go check the kitchen to get the right plate. Sis was trying so hard not to laugh and poor David was confused. Mom squeezed my leg hard so I knew the fun was over.\n\nAfter sis and David left, dad yelled at me for embarrassing him. Mom told me to apologize but I refused saying that I was only trying to help dad out with the prank. I\u2019m grounded until I apologize. \n\nDid I go too far for embarrassing my dad? AITA?\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks for reading my post! Even the people who called my TA, you took the time to read it!\n\nI\u2019m still grounded but it won\u2019t start until sis leaves so I spent the day with her and David. He\u2019s the funniest guy I\u2019ve ever met. He kept sis and I laughing most of the afternoon. He\u2019s also super sweet. He opened the doors for us everywhere we went and pulled out sis\u2019 chair for her at the restaurant during lunch. I like him alot. It wasn\u2019t all good times because they were always holding hands and kissing. I stopped doing that freshman year.\n\nMy visual description of him was not to say he\u2019s ugly but I meant to say he\u2019s the scariest guy I\u2019ve ever met irl. I felt like a queen today because everywhere we went, people just got out of the way.  \n\nAnyway, thanks for taking time to read my post!", "created_utc": 1668258335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt6jpu/aita_for_embarrassing_my_dad_during_dinner_in/", "score": 2869, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What would the guys reaction be if your father pulled a prank on him at the wedding?  Would he laugh it off, or would there be far worse consequences later on, if not before the wedding.

Some people handle hot sauces really well. I have them ranging from 4000 - 2,000,000 scoville. Other people can't. People who have little experience or tolerance for hot sauces can literally be sent to the emergency room because too much was ingested. Cue the assault charges on your dad. Also cue the financial costs for covering the medical care and a lawyer.\n\nYour dad is lucky he didn't go through with it, but it sounds like the only reason he didn't is because he didn't want to get the shit kicked out of him had he gone through with it.
