He regularly watch those old prank vids on YT for hours then try them out on everyone around him. Once I heard my mom screaming upstairs and ran to see what happened. It turned out dad poured a bucket of ice water on her while she was in the shower. Another time I walked out to my car and found it missing. I ran back in the house crying because I thought it got stolen. My dad was laughing so hard he was almost on the floor. He moved my car. I love dad but sometimes it\u2019s exhausting living with him.\n\nMy older sis Jessie (24f) lives out of state. A month ago, she told us she\u2019s coming to visit and bringing home her boyfriend David (I don\u2019t know his age but he looks to be in his older 20s) for us to meet him. Jessie usually likes the pretty boys who wears polo shirts and are around 6 feet tall (this is important, trust me). When dad heard about it, he was so excited he couldn\u2019t hold it in. He ran out and bought the hottest hot sauce he could find. He showed it off to me and mom and told us he\u2019s going to make a special plate for David. Of course I told my sis but she told me not to worry about it.\n\nWhen she came home last night and David walked through the door, we were all shocked. David is a little shorter than sis and a full head shorter than dad. He looks like someone shaved a pit bull and forced it into a sports jacket. I\u2019m not talking about the cute ones you see running downstairs and taking showers with their owners. He looks like someone stuck him into a blender and he won. When he went to shake hands with dad, I can see David had wider shoulders, bigger hands, and his forearms was 2x as big. I could also see and was staring at this scar on the back of his hands and ran up pass the sleeve of his dress shirt.\n\nDinner rolls around and David compliments mom on her cooking, which surprised me. I asked if he really likes it he said yes. Sis and I looked at each other and we instantly knew dad didn\u2019t spike David\u2019s meal. I asked dad if David got the right plate or if there was a mix up. Then I told David dad had prepared a special plate for him. Dad\u2019s face turned bright red and he told me to eat my dinner. Of course I didn\u2019t so I said I\u2019ll go check the kitchen to get the right plate. Sis was trying so hard not to laugh and poor David was confused. Mom squeezed my leg hard so I knew the fun was over.\n\nAfter sis and David left, dad yelled at me for embarrassing him. Mom told me to apologize but I refused saying that I was only trying to help dad out with the prank. I\u2019m grounded until I apologize. \n\nDid I go too far for embarrassing my dad?

Sure you embarrassed your dad but by going out of his way to humiliate others, he invited it. \n\nYour dad needs to learn that pranks aren't cool. They're not fun. They're a power play  Especially when the prankster can't handle when one blows up in his face.\n\nEdit: being grounded until you apologise is also a power play. It's coerced compliance. There's nothing to be gained from it, no useful life lesson for you - it's about your dad's ego. I'm sorry about the situation you're in. \n\nComing from a guy of similar age to your dad, his behaviour sounds abusive and to be honest, a little pathetic. Do what you need to to get by until you move out, and don't set your expectations of reasonable adult behaviour by that of your father.", "YTA for your description of David.", "NTA, but I am not sure what you accomplished with this.

Dad deserved to be called out on his bullying. Sadly, you're going to have to apologize to earn your freedom. You might want to have a talk with your mother about just how much the bullying bothers you; maybe even a counselor.\n\nHow you spoke about David is horrible and you're TA for that.", "NTA.

I don't like calling kids assholes. Dad tho... :/", "Not sure if you meant this for me but I never said Dad was a bully. I don\u2019t care if he pranks his family. As for David, I didn\u2019t see anywhere in post whether or not he is a fun guy & enjoys being pranked. OP described his physical appearance. For all anyone knows he\u2019s a big sensitive guy who hates pranks. For future reference - it\u2019s in poor taste to prank a guest. Etiquette dictates everyone should be on best behavior when hosting & meeting guests for the first time. But you do you!", "I'm right there with you. I normally don't comment when the OP is a minor but this one has me almost hoping OP shows her dad so he can see what actual adults think of his behaviour (OP if you read this, don't do that - it's a terrible idea).", "NTA. I'm a lot closer to your parents' age than yours and your dad's bad behavior is something I'd expect from a kid in middle school, not an adult with children. Your mother is no better for enabling his bad behavior. Don't apologize. Your dad could've gotten his ass kicked by your sister's boyfriend and he would have had no one to blame but himself. He enjoys these pranks because it gives him a sense of power and control over others but in this situation he knew that David would have been the one in control.
