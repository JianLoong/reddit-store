It turned out dad poured a bucket of ice water on her while she was in the shower. Another time I walked out to my car and found it missing.

I love dad but sometimes it\u2019s exhausting living with him.\n\nMy older sis Jessie (24f) lives out of state. A month ago, she told us she\u2019s coming to visit and bringing home her boyfriend David (I don\u2019t know his age but he looks to be in his older 20s) for us to meet him. Jessie usually likes the pretty boys who wears polo shirts and are around 6 feet tall (this is important, trust me). When dad heard about it, he was so excited he couldn\u2019t hold it in. He ran out and bought the hottest hot sauce he could find. He showed it off to me and mom and told us he\u2019s going to make a special plate for David. Of course I told my sis but she told me not to worry about it.\n\nWhen she came home last night and David walked through the door, we were all shocked. David is a little shorter than sis and a full head shorter than dad. He looks like someone shaved a pit bull and forced it into a sports jacket. I\u2019m not talking about the cute ones you see running downstairs and taking showers with their owners. He looks like someone stuck him into a blender and he won. When he went to shake hands with dad, I can see David had wider shoulders, bigger hands, and his forearms was 2x as big. I could also see and was staring at this scar on the back of his hands and ran up pass the sleeve of his dress shirt.\n\nDinner rolls around and David compliments mom on her cooking, which surprised me. I asked if he really likes it he said yes. Sis and I looked at each other and we instantly knew dad didn\u2019t spike David\u2019s meal. I asked dad if David got the right plate or if there was a mix up. Then I told David dad had prepared a special plate for him. Dad\u2019s face turned bright red and he told me to eat my dinner. Of course I didn\u2019t so I said I\u2019ll go check the kitchen to get the right plate. Sis was trying so hard not to laugh and poor David was confused. Mom squeezed my leg hard so I knew the fun was over.\n\nAfter sis and David left, dad yelled at me for embarrassing him. Mom told me to apologize but I refused saying that I was only trying to help dad out with the prank. I\u2019m grounded until I apologize. \n\nDid I go too far for embarrassing my dad?

And a coward.", "I did not understand wth happened", "NTA. Dad's a bully and sis found someone dad was too afraid to torment. Good for her.", "NTA \nYour dad doesn\u2019t sound funny. He sounds terribly immature and obnoxious.", "NTA. Your dad only likes to humiliate people who can't beat his ass. Pranks are just elaborate bullying. Dad knew he couldn't cover the cost of his bullshit that night and was embarrassed by his being a punk. Good. Hopefully, that nonsense is over.", "NTA... In my family, it is commonly accepted amongst the crazy cousins/uncles that those who joke around and play pranks must be willing to take it back as well... Whatever you give you must be able to take.", "Nta. Your dad only pranks people that he thinks can't/won't fight back. That's why he didn't prank the new boyfriend. That means he knows it's abusive and that you guys don't like it, but he does it anyway because you can't stop him. This is disgusting. I hope you're able to get some peace in your home somehow...", "NTA  Just goes to show Dad isnt a prankster, he is an abuser who only targets weaker people. My apology would be \"Dad I am sorry I assumed you were a prankster, now I lnow you are an abuser who only targets people you see as \"weaker\" to inflict pranks on.  I realize now you only respect physically stronger men. Also, we need to go to counseling as a family to address your aggression towards women.\"", "NTA. Sounds like your dad only enjoys pranks as long as he\u2019s not on the receiving end.", "Pranks are always mean. Tampering with somebody's food is rude and potentially dangerous. Humiliating a guest on their first visit to the family is unforgivable. Your father is a juvenile arsehole. Who cares if your father is embarrassed? Wasn't the plan to embarrass David?  NTA", "NTA. Lmao your dad raised a pretty witty girl for a man who loves Youtube levels pranks and tries to do the same kind of thing. The only thing I'd say is that you should maybe explain the situation to David. I bet he felt weird and since it was the first time he was around and out of the \"inside joke\", he might have felt like people made fun of him and didn't understand what he did wrong. You might bond together sharing a good laugh with him and your sister.", "Am I the only one here confused as hell as to why it\u2019s important that David is short? Your whole family sounds exhausting and kind of awful but why is your dad too chickenshit to prank a short dude? Is it bc he looked strong and your dad was scared of getting his ass beat? Your dads a coward. Pranksters are almost always cowards so that\u2019s not surprising. EHS except for David. Hope he doesn\u2019t get trapped in y\u2019all\u2019s icky dynamic", "NTA. But apologize to David. Dude was caught in the middle of something weird and you kinda fed on that. But your dad is a grade A bully. Like I would talk to someone like a school counselor about it if your Mom is unhelpful (which in the case of David she is siding with your dad??) He seems to want power over people he sees as weaker than him. I would say dont apologize to your dad, hold your ground. But ultimately do what you think will make life more bearable until you can get out. \n\nI also would love to give a shout out to your sister, who seemed to totally know what was going to happen and I think she may have even counted in it. It sucks that she even had to think about this.", "Seriously, none of these are pranks, they are just mean and show that he enjoys watching people at best, uncomfortable if not downright traumatized. He likes to watch people cry. That\u2019s bad.\n\nThe post from the other day about the spider accident, THAT was a prank. These are not. They are mean.", "Sounds like dad had a \u201cvision\u201d of him getting his ass beat for one of his stupid pranks and chickened out.", "Bingo.\n\nHe made a judgement on the guys looks that if there was a confrontation he wouldn't be able to laugh it off.\n\nDad's the AH for the pranks, the punishment to OP and unfairly judging someone", "Yeeeah if you dosed me with hot sauce in the amounts I suspect OPs dad was planning I\u2019d be physically ill and when I found out why I\u2019d genuinely consider reporting him for assault. Might not get anywhere without me hiring a shark lawyer but I\u2019d consider it.", "Time to \u2018prank\u2019 the dad", "\"He looks like someone stuck him into a blender and he won.\"\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80 The whole description is gold but this line f\\*ing got me\n\nI agree with magnus_the_fish, especially the edit. NTA!", "> most important part is GOOD NATURED.\n\nSurely not with people you just met? Surely the important part is to get to know them so you'll know if it'll be taken as intended or if bulldog Dave is gonna get angry and make you regret it.", "Wait, how did she speak about David? I\u2019m confused.", "I had to read it a few times just to try to understand what they were saying. Were they saying David is short, stocky, and ugly??? And because of that, Dad didn't want to prank him anymore?\n\nEdit: just saw some other comments that OP was trying to say he looked tough and maybe Dad wouldn't prank him because he was afraid of a violent reaction", "Yeah, what the fuck was that about? Really uncalled for.", "I think OP was just trying to show that her dad was expecting the bf to be someone who was physically weaker than him and therefore an easier target in his mind. And instead, a physically intimidating man who might have even been able to injure OP's dad had he reacted violently to being poisoned showed up instead. And dad chickened out because of his physical appearance. Obviously dad is an asshole either way and I'm not saying that I agree with his opinions of other men's appearances and it doesn't seem to me like OP does either, but I think that OP recognizes the way that her dad thinks and included the physical descriptors because it explains the dad's behavior. And I think that's a legitimate reason.", "Yeah I was so confused reading that part?", "So the Dad isn\u2019t an AH?", "That's brilliant!! Lol", "Genius? You must be very stupid if you\u2019re impressed by that. How sad", "I was thinking the opposite, that statement alone made her TA and was just cringe", "OP should double down on the fact that she was pranking dad.", "There was a story on Reddit of a wife who poured ice water on her husband while he was in the bathtub, as a prank. It shocked him so much that he jumped up, slipped, fell and hit his head, and was in a coma for weeks/months(?) and had some traumatic injuries that he's still dealing with. \n\nThis whole \"ice water while someone is bathing\" crap has GOT to stop! It's just flat out dangerous, and it's not at all funny.", "That ice water prank was incredibly dangerous, by the way. What if Mom slipped and fell in the shower, as many people do under normal circumstances? Serious injuries happen all the time from people falling in the shower. That's a dumb place to prank someone.", "Yep, wonder if he'd prank OP and Mom if they were big and angry enough to curbstomp him too, or does respect to him come from intimidation across the board?", "Ditto - it would potentially trigger days of reflux for me - I love spicy food but if I\u2019m in a flare up it does *not* love me .", "I actually agree. Another person went so far as to say that Dad could go to court for tampering with David\u2019s food?? It\u2019s a hot sauce prank?? Lmao", "YES oh my gosh, OP has a knack for descriptive writing, that sent me", "I'll be honest, if the dad was an equal opportunity offender, hot sauced Dave, and taken the consequences, I might call him NTA. Live by the prank, get-beaten-up-by-your-daughter's-boyfriend by the prank.\n\nETA - just to add, you're right that Noone should cold prank strangers, but it seemed from the post that OP and her sister had lots of warning to stop it from happening, but maybe I've missread something", "I agree, but she's 16 and under their roof - sometimes you have to retreat from a battle to win the war. I hope it opens the door to a serious conversation of the effect these pranks are having on her. She also put a guest in an awkward spot while trying to embarrass her father and that's not cool.", "OP's sister had probably filled him in beforehand. :)", "and pour a bucket of ice water over the front seat", "Prepare for the downvotes lol, I\u2019m ok with it, but it\u2019s a brave comment. I did not read that comment though such a litigious society\u2026 kind of crazy.", ">  it seemed from the post that OP and her sister had lots of warning to stop it from happening, but maybe I've missread something\n\nI think you are right, they seem to have odd ideas how to treat people.", "Those are fair points actually, so I don\u2019t know how to call this one.", "Not to mention crazy dangerous. Falling in the bathroom causes severe injury and death all the time.", "well then why was he confused", "Very fair. That's why I was willing to give dad the pass, but as soon as he stopped because the boyfriend looked tough, he showed himself a bully and, in my humble opinion, the asshole. Fair for you but not for me isn't pranking, it's abuse", "I'd act confused too. :) Just to make it *even more awkward* for my gf's dad.", "No assumptions whatsoever. It\u2019s exactly what happened based on the facts.\n\nA prank is something *both parties* find funny. If it\u2019s only the one doing it that finds it funny then it is bullying *by definition* as it is causing emotional or physical harm intentionally for their own amusement.\n\nThat he didn\u2019t do it to someone *he* was intimidated by demonstrates that *he knows the other person doesn\u2019t find his \u201cpranks\u201d funny*.\n\nErgo: he\u2019s a bully, it\u2019s bullying, and you\u2019re defending it.", "We should just retire the word prank, as now intentions no longer matter and it is just bullying", "Intentions don't matter more than the effects. If I slip and stab you with a knife I'm holding, you don't just stop bleeding because I didn't mean to.", "But no knives are in the post. It\u2019s hot sauce, so I do not follow your points absurdities do not win points with me. I can make up outlandish things as well as the next guy. So I reject your point entirely."]}
