He regularly watch those old prank vids on YT for hours then try them out on everyone around him. Once I heard my mom screaming upstairs and ran to see what happened. It turned out dad poured a bucket of ice water on her while she was in the shower. Another time I walked out to my car and found it missing. I ran back in the house crying because I thought it got stolen. My dad was laughing so hard he was almost on the floor. He moved my car. I love dad but sometimes it\u2019s exhausting living with him.\n\nMy older sis Jessie (24f) lives out of state. A month ago, she told us she\u2019s coming to visit and bringing home her boyfriend David (I don\u2019t know his age but he looks to be in his older 20s) for us to meet him. Jessie usually likes the pretty boys who wears polo shirts and are around 6 feet tall (this is important, trust me). When dad heard about it, he was so excited he couldn\u2019t hold it in. He ran out and bought the hottest hot sauce he could find. He showed it off to me and mom and told us he\u2019s going to make a special plate for David. Of course I told my sis but she told me not to worry about it.\n\nWhen she came home last night and David walked through the door, we were all shocked. David is a little shorter than sis and a full head shorter than dad. He looks like someone shaved a pit bull and forced it into a sports jacket. I\u2019m not talking about the cute ones you see running downstairs and taking showers with their owners. He looks like someone stuck him into a blender and he won. When he went to shake hands with dad, I can see David had wider shoulders, bigger hands, and his forearms was 2x as big. I could also see and was staring at this scar on the back of his hands and ran up pass the sleeve of his dress shirt.\n\nDinner rolls around and David compliments mom on her cooking, which surprised me. I asked if he really likes it he said yes. Sis and I looked at each other and we instantly knew dad didn\u2019t spike David\u2019s meal. I asked dad if David got the right plate or if there was a mix up. Then I told David dad had prepared a special plate for him. Dad\u2019s face turned bright red and he told me to eat my dinner. Of course I didn\u2019t so I said I\u2019ll go check the kitchen to get the right plate. Sis was trying so hard not to laugh and poor David was confused. Mom squeezed my leg hard so I knew the fun was over.\n\nAfter sis and David left, dad yelled at me for embarrassing him. Mom told me to apologize but I refused saying that I was only trying to help dad out with the prank. I\u2019m grounded until I apologize. \n\nDid I go too far for embarrassing my dad?

These 'pranks' are Dad being a bully. He didn't see the new boyfriend as an easy target or weaker than him, so he wimped out when it came to pulling the 'prank'.", "NTA. Sure you embarrassed your dad but by going out of his way to humiliate others, he invited it. \n\nYour dad needs to learn that pranks aren't cool. They're not fun. They're a power play  Especially when the prankster can't handle when one blows up in his face.\n\nEdit: being grounded until you apologise is also a power play. It's coerced compliance. There's nothing to be gained from it, no useful life lesson for you - it's about your dad's ego. I'm sorry about the situation you're in. \n\nComing from a guy of similar age to your dad, his behaviour sounds abusive and to be honest, a little pathetic. Do what you need to to get by until you move out, and don't set your expectations of reasonable adult behaviour by that of your father.", "YTA for your description of David.", "NTA, but I am not sure what you accomplished with this. From David's perspective, it looks like you were trying to pull something, not your Dad.\n\nBTW, your Dad is a jerk. When you have kids, don't be like him.", "I'm not sure you are the most mature person, seeing as how you probably made David feel really uncomfortable. But wow, your dad's true colors are showing. He's a coward, and his ego is very fragile. Maybe that's a common profile of the avid prankster.", "ESH \u2014 your Dad shouldn\u2019t be \u201cpranking\u201d guests & you shouldn\u2019t have pushed the conversation beyond asking if David really liked dinner. As you said \u201cpoor David\u201d .... exactly. You embarrassed yourself & thought it was amusing to make your family look like aholes. David is the person who is owed an apology.", "NTA and YTA. Dad deserved to be called out on his bullying. Sadly, you're going to have to apologize to earn your freedom. You might want to have a talk with your mother about just how much the bullying bothers you; maybe even a counselor.\n\nHow you spoke about David is horrible and you're TA for that.", "NTA.  You didn't embarrass him on purpose.  Dad created an awkward situation and it blew up  in his face - not your fault.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And everything you said about David was just awful!", "NTA and lol your Dad got some act right quick when he saw David!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Look I LOVE LOVE LOVE to play practical jokes (got from my Dad) but feeding someone hot sauce like that is not ok.

That was an over-reaction and a true AH move.\n\nI guess the only person who is innocent here is the boyfriend.", "NTA. You did the right thing. If your sister had a plan to circumvent the \"prank\", then she should have communicated that plan to you or at least hinted at it better. You shouldn't let your dad bully other people with unfunny \"pranks\" like that, especially if it's the hottest of hot sauces he could find, it could mess someone up.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like David knew what was going on. Your sister may have explained it later, but so what? What was he embarrassed about? That he was going to pull a juvenile truck on a stranger and then, thankfully \u201csobered up\u201d in time to stop himself? Please.", "NTA. I love a good prank too but just pranking strangers is asshole behaviour and if I knew my dad was gonna prank every partner that I brought to dinner I'd just never do that & make sure my dad knew why.", "NTA.\n\nI have no problem with anyone humiliating a bully, and anyone that excited about spiking someone's food with hot sauce is a bully.\n\nAlso I have to acknowledge that I am the TA here, because while your description of David was very mean, I couldn't help laughing at it.", "NTA, you dropped your crown queen \ud83d\udc51\n\nDad's out here dishing pranks left and right, but can't even take a little ribbing. Sounds like a him problem.", "Right? How sad", "I figure OP is allowed a little immaturity since she's a child. It pales in comparison to her dad's though. I agree - his behaviour is cowardly and ego driven.", "I think from OPs description David can hold his own. I LOVE to play practical jokes and no one has ever called me a bully. (A demon maybe, but not a bully). The food thing was not cool, some people get sick from spicy foods, but everyone needs to simmer down.", "I don't think it was the height. I think the muscles and scars imply he is a tough guy who shouldn't be messed with and dad didn't want to play a prank on someone who could fight back.", "Yeah, the description was horrible.", "That's why I don't call her an asshole. I don't like calling kids assholes. Dad tho... :/", "Not sure if you meant this for me but I never said Dad was a bully. I don\u2019t care if he pranks his family. As for David, I didn\u2019t see anywhere in post whether or not he is a fun guy & enjoys being pranked. OP described his physical appearance. For all anyone knows he\u2019s a big sensitive guy who hates pranks. For future reference - it\u2019s in poor taste to prank a guest. Etiquette dictates everyone should be on best behavior when hosting & meeting guests for the first time. But you do you!", "I'm right there with you. I normally don't comment when the OP is a minor but this one has me almost hoping OP shows her dad so he can see what actual adults think of his behaviour (OP if you read this, don't do that - it's a terrible idea)."]}
