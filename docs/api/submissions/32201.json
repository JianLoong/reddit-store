If I had bought an ornament for my grandchild and their parents had also got them one, great! Baby gets 2 ornaments!\n\nThe fact that your mother is acting really unhinged about this is telling me that she feels very entitled to have all the firsts with your child. She will 100% try to steal other firsts like solid food, first sweets and many other things if you don't call out this behavior right now. \n\nShe needs to be reminded whose baby this is and where her place in baby's life is and isn't.", "NTA.  This is YOUR baby and you get to buy all the \"My first..\" things. Tell your mom that goes for trikes and bikes too, unless given permission first.", "NTA. You can also have more than one ornament?", "NTA my parents literally got 6 \"baby's first Christmas\" ornaments for my first Christmas. They all still get hung on the Christmas tree every year. It's not an issue.", "NTA.  What is wrong with your mother (and father)? It's an ORNAMENT.  If your daughter gets multiple ornaments for her first Christmas, doesn't matter who gives them, even if they are duplicates, etc.    Your daughter, you do whatever you want & Continue focusing on your blessings.", "NTA. And shut down her irritation. \u201cMom, that\u2019s sweet but you can go ahead and assume since she\u2019s my daughter that I will be buying or experiencing my child\u2019s \u201cfirsts\u201d\u201d.", "NTA.

If she had communicated this to you, you wouldn\u2019t have purchased one.\n\nQuestion- is this a one off situation, or is your mom generally controlling? From what you\u2019ve described here she sounds like someone who likes to control what other people do. I\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t the case. \n\nYou could tell her that you had no way of knowing you were getting the ornament from her, but you would be happy to receive it anyway.

We want to get our own because my husband and I both coincidentally have Precious Moments brand Baby\u2019s First Christmas ornaments so we want one for our son, too. I think the best thing you can do is assure her that having two is not the end of the world and they\u2019ll both be special. I have two - one that was on my grandma\u2019s tree while she was alive and the one my mom and dad bought me.", "She's only a baby ffs, she will have no idea what it is, and at that age she will have no interest in it either.

But also I always thought all those ornaments were for celebrating \"Baby's First Christmas\"-- not that the important part was that it literally was the baby's first Christmas ORNAMENT. My siblings and I all have multiple \"First Christmas\" ornaments that our parents got and other people gifted because it's about the baby's first holiday, not being the first one to get the baby an ornament. Also, it will be just as special to the kid one day if it's \"and this was the first Christmas ornament given to you *from Grandma*\" even if it's not \"this was the first Christmas ornament given to you ever in your life.\" This way, your daughter would get a special first ornament from Mom *and* a special first ornament from Grandma.

If you don't stop this behavior now it will only get worse. Your mother and father need to understand the only place they get in your child's life is the place you ALLOW them to have. NTA", "ESH.  Seriously,  there was no need for anyone to react strongly at this.", "NAH\n\nI really wish that people would stop being competitive over children, especially when it comes to loving them, and try to understand that \"firsts\" don't have to be exclusive, and they certainly aren't something to be selfish over.\n\nOne of my best friends had her first (and possibly only, for a variety of reasons) baby last year. She is a little bit of an older mum, and many of us in our close friend group are childless (but not necessarily \"child-free\" - we love kids, but don't have our own for a whole variety of reasons including being single, illness, etc.) so her little guy has a whole passel of adoring \"aunties\" who love to spoil him. PLUS he's the only grandchild on her side of the family.\n\nSo you'd think that last Christmas, his first, would have ended up in a nightmare of competition for \"firsts\" like OP describes. But it absolutely didn't. Instead, do you know what happened? \n\nA couple of friends checked in with the parents for their permission (always the most important thing), and instead of a single \"first ornament\" we all got together and arranged for a little tabletop \"Baby's First Christmas Tree\" . . . and EVERYONE got to buy \"first ornaments\" for him. Since many of us live out of town, his parents spent a couple of weeks excitedly receiving packages with ornaments for this beautiful little tree that was just for the baby, showing them to him, hanging them on his tree, and sending pics to all of us so we could enjoy his excitement. Everyone sent ornaments that felt special to them - from traditional \"Baby's 1st Christmas\" ones or personalised ones with his name, to fun, silly ornaments (I got him ones made to look like vintage toys from his parents' childhoods). By Christmas he had a tree covered in special ornaments from friends and family, and their little family had a whole new tradition borne out of the love of friends and family for their child. \n\nMy point is: we all need to stop fighting over \"who gets to be first\" and realise that EVERYONE can do these firsts together. As someone else said, OP's baby can have a first ornament from Grandma, a first ornament from Mama and Daddy, and they will all be special. \n\nBut ultimately I'm saying NAH because I don't think the grandmother is an AH. I think she had her hopes up and was disappointed, and this should be a conversation, but calling an excited grandmother an AH feels super wrong.", "Seriously my kids have about 5 baby\u2019s first ornaments each because we bought one, my mom bought one, my aunt bought one.. etc. they are all different and they were all sweet gifts.  \n\n\nTell mom thank you and for her to live in.

Think first birthday, first backpack for school, first haircut, ear piercing, whatever thing you want to do with your own kid, but she does first. Perhaps just a light hearted, how about you check in to see if we already have a plan for what you want do/buy. I had to sit my mom down and very seriously tell her that getting froggy and violating my boundaries as a mother would result in less time with baby and zero unsupervised time. \n\nMy mom had a HUGE issue wanting to give the baby foods the pediatrician said not to introduce them to until after 12 months. I followed those directions strictly because it was about potential allergies and access to vaccines. She just couldn\u2019t believe scrambled eggs or peanut butter could do any harm because she gave it to us. I had to get real firm. Then, a few years later, my kid was being a toddler level brat and I was addressing his behavior using the plan his father decided on for such occasions. My dad jumped in and started baby talking to him and was all like trying to make him happy by giving him treats rather than seeing my kid have to experience age appropriate consequences for behavior. I looked at him with my best teacher face in my lowest tone and calmly and firmly told my lifetime military, intimidating father to back off and not interfere. I must have sounded like some sort of demon because my father\u2019s eyes popped, he apologized and never did it again. Anyway, all that to say- set your boundaries now! \n\nCongratulations on the little one. Nothing is ever the same after.", "NTA.\n\nI'm looking at my older son's First Christmas ornament right now. He received it at a coed baby shower that my husband's squadron members gave us. A wonderful friend purchased it, and I thought it was very thoughtful of him; I love it. That was 30 years ago. \n\nMy son was a rainbow baby. Our friends were so happy for us. Most of the men at the shower were single, but they stepped up like family for our young family, stationed far from home.", "Nta.\n\nI had purchased an ornament for my daughter and she was also gifted one by my sibling. Did I care? A little, but I also liked that my sister thought of me and did something special.", "NTA. Personally I believe that right should be yours since it\u2019s your child. I\u2019m going to suggest something for your mother to do, but first think about it for yourself to coordinate it properly. Start a tradition for your mom and her grandchild(ren) that is theirs only. As an example, my parents would get my brother and I a silver plate snowflake ornament every year. The idea was that once we were adults and on our own/with our own families, we would have a decent amount of ornaments for our tree to start with instead of having to build from scratch (and also we\u2019d continue it on our own). Maybe you could have your mom do this. An added caveat: if you like this idea for yourself pick what YOU want to use, then suggest the idea to your mom but saying you are doing the same but with [ornament] so that there\u2019s no duplicate. In fact, being the first Christmas this would be a good year to start. Just make sure you get the first ornament from whatever you will do before telling your mom so that you can tell her you\u2019ve already gotten the first of whatever you choose. It can be a bell (sleigh bell or regular bell), or a snowflake, or a nutcracker figurine, or any myriad of things and from a myriad of materials (the snowflake may be crystal instead of silver, etc.) Also, make it something that can continue. The 12 days of Christmas are cute, but after 12 years you\u2019ve run out of ornaments to keep going. In short, the tradition for your mom (and dad) could be that she gets them a nutcracker figurine ornament every year. That will be her thing so that no one else gets them that type of ornament. You could then do the bell, and another family member (like the other set of grandparents) could do the snowflake. This has the benefit of decorating your tree with lots of pretty ornaments without you going out to buy lots of ornaments all the time, and also sets up your child(ren) for their future trees. The down side is that when they take their ornaments with them as adults, you\u2019ll have to make up for that lack of decoration, but you can take the time to be building for your future tree as well with something you like, but the kids probably won\u2019t care for.", "NTA.

It doesn't matter if your mom wanted to gift you an ornament for your daughter, you wanted to buy one yourself.", "OP, have you ever read up on narcissists? Looking at some info might be useful. Maybe you'll learn more about your mom.", "Every grandparent gets excited to the point of overbearing at some point. When this happens, I'll ask the grandparent about how excited they were to do the first [event] with their kid. Of course they light up remembering it. Then I say how excited I am to do this as a parent with *my* kid. Often that's enough of a reminder to stay in their lane. \n\nOn the ornament note: NTA. We were given multiple ornaments for each kids' first Christmas. Some go on the tree, some are so not my style and they stay in the box. Just say \"thanks!\" for the gift, it doesn't obligate you to display it. Yours is still your child's first ornament.", "No way should OP govern her behavior based upon what her crazy mother decides to do.", "Reddit got rid of awards, sadly.", "OP's mother is way out of line. Super out of line. BUT, it is worth standing your ground and blowing up the baby's first Christmas over a misunderstanding about a gift? One of the two parties needs to de-escalate the situation, and I can't talk to OP's mom, only to OP. So, if saying \"I would love you to get this for my daughter and any future children\" smooths the rough spot, is it really terrible to NOT blow up your relationship with your mom?"]}
