She\u2019s definitely ruined the gift now she\u2019s causing such an issue", " NTA. As a grandmother myself, I'm appalled at your mother's behavior. If I had bought an ornament for my grandchild and their parents had also got them one, great! Baby gets 2 ornaments!\n\nThe fact that your mother is acting really unhinged about this is telling me that she feels very entitled to have all the firsts with your child. She will 100% try to steal other firsts like solid food, first sweets and many other things if you don't call out this behavior right now. \n\nShe needs to be reminded whose baby this is and where her place in baby's life is and isn't.", "NTA.  This is YOUR baby and you get to buy all the \"My first..\" things. Tell your mom that goes for trikes and bikes too, unless given permission first.", "NTA. You can also have more than one ornament?", "NTA my parents literally got 6 \"baby's first Christmas\" ornaments for my first Christmas. They all still get hung on the Christmas tree every year. It's not an issue.", "NTA.  What is wrong with your mother (and father)? It's an ORNAMENT.  If your daughter gets multiple ornaments for her first Christmas, doesn't matter who gives them, even if they are duplicates, etc.    Your daughter, you do whatever you want & Continue focusing on your blessings.", "NTA. And shut down her irritation. \u201cMom, that\u2019s sweet but you can go ahead and assume since she\u2019s my daughter that I will be buying or experiencing my child\u2019s \u201cfirsts\u201d\u201d.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s normal for grandparents to furnish some of the \u201cfirsts\u201d but unless this is a family tradition you\u2019ve seen with other children in the family, she should have communicated this.", "NTA. Your ornament is for your house your mom's is for her house.", "NTA- I\u2019m assuming you can\u2019t read people\u2019s minds, so how would you know that your mom would be gifting you an ornament? If she had communicated this to you, you wouldn\u2019t have purchased one.\n\nQuestion- is this a one off situation, or is your mom generally controlling? From what you\u2019ve described here she sounds like someone who likes to control what other people do. I\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t the case. \n\nYou could tell her that you had no way of knowing you were getting the ornament from her, but you would be happy to receive it anyway. Then the ball is in her court. Worst case scenario your daughter has 2 ornaments. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong here.", "NTA. You are mom. What you want and intend comes first. Grandma can chill.", "NTA. I HATE family members who think they get to hijack a parents\u2019 firsts. My aunt-in-law got us a baby\u2019s first Christmas ornament (they dropped it off when they came to visit him as a newborn) but we don\u2019t intend to use it. We want to get our own because my husband and I both coincidentally have Precious Moments brand Baby\u2019s First Christmas ornaments so we want one for our son, too. I think the best thing you can do is assure her that having two is not the end of the world and they\u2019ll both be special. I have two - one that was on my grandma\u2019s tree while she was alive and the one my mom and dad bought me.", "She's only a baby ffs, she will have no idea what it is, and at that age she will have no interest in it either. She'll be more interested in things she can play with, including wrapping baby and an empty box.", "NTA - My mother and mother in law both bought my daughter and son ornaments each year. When we realized we all bought one we decided that whoever bought it, then it stays at that persons house to decorate with each year!!!", "NTA.\n\nParents get priority for \"firsts\" unless permission is given. But also I always thought all those ornaments were for celebrating \"Baby's First Christmas\"-- not that the important part was that it literally was the baby's first Christmas ORNAMENT. My siblings and I all have multiple \"First Christmas\" ornaments that our parents got and other people gifted because it's about the baby's first holiday, not being the first one to get the baby an ornament. Also, it will be just as special to the kid one day if it's \"and this was the first Christmas ornament given to you *from Grandma*\" even if it's not \"this was the first Christmas ornament given to you ever in your life.\" This way, your daughter would get a special first ornament from Mom *and* a special first ornament from Grandma. Your mom needs to calm down.", "NTA There can be multiple ornaments. Neither has to not be special because there are two.", "NTA, tell her you are her mother and assume all firsts are being handled by you unless she is told otherwise.\n\nShe had her turn, if she wanted to give baby a first ornament, she should have given you one for your first Christmas.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is YOUR kid, and you are fine to buy YOUR kid the first christmas ornament,. Ignore your mom's drama - SHE is the only AH here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she does not come to her senses, have a lot less contact with her.", "My son got a 1st Christmas ornament from me, two grandmothers, and my best friend.  \n\nYou really can\u2019t have too many 1st Christmas ornaments. \n\nSorry but Mom needs to chill. \n\nNTA", "Your mother is not entitled to any of YOUR child's first anything. \n\nYou really need to set some solid boundaries with your parents now.  If you don't stop this behavior now it will only get worse. Your mother and father need to understand the only place they get in your child's life is the place you ALLOW them to have. NTA", "ESH.  Seriously,  there was no need for anyone to react strongly at this.", "NAH\n\nI really wish that people would stop being competitive over children, especially when it comes to loving them, and try to understand that \"firsts\" don't have to be exclusive, and they certainly aren't something to be selfish over.\n\nOne of my best friends had her first (and possibly only, for a variety of reasons) baby last year. She is a little bit of an older mum, and many of us in our close friend group are childless (but not necessarily \"child-free\" - we love kids, but don't have our own for a whole variety of reasons including being single, illness, etc.) so her little guy has a whole passel of adoring \"aunties\" who love to spoil him. PLUS he's the only grandchild on her side of the family.\n\nSo you'd think that last Christmas, his first, would have ended up in a nightmare of competition for \"firsts\" like OP describes. But it absolutely didn't. Instead, do you know what happened? \n\nA couple of friends checked in with the parents for their permission (always the most important thing), and instead of a single \"first ornament\" we all got together and arranged for a little tabletop \"Baby's First Christmas Tree\" . . . and EVERYONE got to buy \"first ornaments\" for him. Since many of us live out of town, his parents spent a couple of weeks excitedly receiving packages with ornaments for this beautiful little tree that was just for the baby, showing them to him, hanging them on his tree, and sending pics to all of us so we could enjoy his excitement. Everyone sent ornaments that felt special to them - from traditional \"Baby's 1st Christmas\" ones or personalised ones with his name, to fun, silly ornaments (I got him ones made to look like vintage toys from his parents' childhoods). By Christmas he had a tree covered in special ornaments from friends and family, and their little family had a whole new tradition borne out of the love of friends and family for their child. \n\nMy point is: we all need to stop fighting over \"who gets to be first\" and realise that EVERYONE can do these firsts together. As someone else said, OP's baby can have a first ornament from Grandma, a first ornament from Mama and Daddy, and they will all be special. \n\nBut ultimately I'm saying NAH because I don't think the grandmother is an AH. I think she had her hopes up and was disappointed, and this should be a conversation, but calling an excited grandmother an AH feels super wrong.", "Seriously my kids have about 5 baby\u2019s first ornaments each because we bought one, my mom bought one, my aunt bought one.. etc. they are all different and they were all sweet gifts.  \n\n\nTell mom thank you and for her to live in. She could also do grandma & baby ornaments every year.. my mom did that with my kids. Sometimes a cartoon character or a photo ornament or one they made together..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
