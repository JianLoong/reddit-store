My boss is hosting a Super Bowl party and he went to college with a guy who was a pretty decent sized name in the NFL in mid 2010s. I asked my boss if my nephew (edit: and his best friend) could come and he said this player loves kids who the love the game so for sure. I told nephew and he\u2019s been so excited.\n\nPart 2: I stayed in last night and decided to get take out from a local \u201cchicken wing place.\u201d Order was 7 shades of screwed so as I waited for them to fix it I started chatting with the bar tender and we hit it off big time. Like as in she was getting off work and she asked me if I wanted to come watch last of us with her at her apartment. Quite literally the funnest night of my life because it was so easy. We made blanket forts and popcorn and watched the show. I\u2019m going to marry her without question. I asked her if she wanted to come to the party with us and she said she always takes the day off to go solo hiking but asked if I wanted to come. Without even thinking of my nephew I said yes.\n\nI left her house being totally in love and excited to see her again but then it hit me that I can\u2019t do both. One one hand if I skip the date I don\u2019t get to see this girl again and risk that but if I don\u2019t take my nephew it will break his heart. But if I\u2019m being honest I would much rather be outside with her than in a room watching a game I don\u2019t care about.\n\n\nAITA if I cancel the plans with my nephew?", "created_utc": 1676216044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110if7v/aita_for_canceling_my_plans_to_take_nephew_to/", "score": 368, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Besides, what will it tell this girl about you that you would crush a 9-year-old's dreams in such a way.  She will have much more respect for you if you are honest, explain that you had so much fun with her that when she asked you to go on the hike with her, you forgot all about the promise you made to your nephew.", "Omg YTA for canceling plans with a 9yo child! If you\u2019re so certain you\u2019re gonna marry this woman you\u2019ve known for 12 hours then you\u2019ll have plenty of time to hike with her.", "Yes yta \n\nHe's 9. I'm surprised this was even a question for you. Go out with her another time. On another note, you don't seem mature enough to even be thinking about marriage...\n\nETA: if I found out a guy ditched his 9 year old nephew to hang out with me, I would be pissed. This is why I think you're immature...", "Oh come on. You met an amazing bartender at a chicken wing place who invited you, a stranger, to her home and made blanket forts with you and you're going to go on a hike with her and then marry her? Sure Jan.", "Ywbta if you cancel on your nephew. That's just wrong. If the girl is as amazing as you think, she'll totally understand", "YTA. \n\nThis feels like bad fiction. If it\u2019s real, this is a crap show. If your boss values people keeping their word, he\u2019s not going to be impressed that you broke your promise to your nephew. If he isn\u2019t, then he won\u2019t give a heck. If I were her and I knew about your promise to him, I\u2019d be disgusted you could do that so easily.", "90% of the posts on this sub seem to be people who know they're complete assholes but desperately hope to stumble on a pocket of other toxically self-involved narcissists that will validate them.", "Yes YTA if you disappoint a child this way. If this girl doesn\u2019t understand why you need to cancel, she is not the one for you.", "YTA, don\u2019t do that to a child.  You\u2019re fucking with his ability to trust others AND teaching him that it is okay to bail on a commitment because you found something better to do.  Not cool.", "YTA. You could make a massive memory for your nephew and you don\u2019t want to for something you can put off to another day? Seriously in what world are you not an arse?", "YTA- I remember my first girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nYou made a promise, hyped the kid up, and now want to pull the rug from under him?\n\nIf you had such a great time with her, did you not get her number? I mean, how else are you going to know when and where to go??\n\nI\u2019m also sure that she would prefer you keep your promise to your nephew for this once in a lifetime opportunity, plus, you could always ask if she would be willing to link up *after*\n\nIf you ditch your nephew, expect his parents to be pissed and your nephew to never trust you again", "YTA for even considering this. How is this really a once in a life time opportunity to hang out with her? You can\u2019t just be honest and tell her you double booked and you need to honor your previous commitment? She goes hiking every weekend. Go with her next weekend. This actually is likely a once in a lifetime event for your nephew. I would be furious if one of my siblings canceled on my son for something like this. He would be devastated. This would be like a go no contact situation for the level of cruelty.", "YWBTA times a million if you cancel on your nephew.\n\nThat party would mean the world to that kid, he'd remember it for his entire life.\n\nThe girl goes hiking every weekend, you can put her off a week to give your nephew a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nEspecially since you already told him. You'll shatter his heart, and any \"cool uncle\" thing you have with him will be sour.", "YWBTA \n\nNot sure how you even need to ask.", "Yes, YWBTA for cancelling on your nephew.

If this woman is as wonderful as you think, she'll appreciate that you put your nephew first. If you cancel on him, he'll never forget it. This is where you find out if you're a man of your word or not. You can't always put yourself first, sometimes you have to do things you don't want to because you're an adult.\n\nEdited to add, you already asked your boss about bringing your nephew. You don't want to look like a flake to your boss.", "YWBTA - Don't bail on a commitment you already made. The dude is 9 and this is a horrible thing to do to him and a horrible lesson to teach him. Do better, make the right choice.", "YTA dont even have to read the post.", "Wow dude.. if you cancel on your nephew YTA and a big one at that! This girl, if she's as great as you say she is should understand you having to postpone that date. Don't do that to your nephew man.. it would be cruel.", "YTA DUH, wtf even is that question. Honor the promise you made with your cousin instead of making plans with some girl YOU JUST MET. Do i rlly need to play the elsa to your anna rn?? If the girl was decent she would understand why you couldn't make it, and would reschedule with you another time. It's not like you'd never see her again, just text her dude.", "YTA- for choosing a one night stand over your nephew! If this girl is a keeper, she\u2019d understand and respect you already had plans with your nephew and reschedule your date.", "YWBTA without hesitation!!!!\n\nYou have the chance to make a memory of a lifetime for your nephew. You would break his heart. For what??? What if you hang out with this woman today and it's a complete dud?? \n\nIf this woman is the love of your life, she will be around on Monday. Show her that you're a man who keeps his word.... Take your nephew to the damn party!!", "YTA...Ditching your nephew for someone you just met is such an AH move. If you told this girl that you were sorry and that you made plans with your 9 year old nephew she would understand and maybe even think it was cute that you were willing to do this for him. If she didn't understand something like this than this is probably not someone you'd want a future with.", "\"if I skip the date I don't get to see this girl again\"\n\nUnless she's going to dissolve into seafoam when the clock strikes midnight, just reschedule like normal adults. YWBTA for cancelling on your nephew.", "Easy YTA.\n\nJust tell this woman you just met exactly what happened: You think she is amazing and were so excited to hang out with her again that you totally forgot about your plans.  Then explain how you don\u2019t want to let your nephew down.  Maybe make plans for a different day with her.", "YTA.", "Just tell her the truth and ask if you can join her next week and take her out to dinner to make up for it.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you get to see her again? How do you think she would feel if she knew you ditched a 9 year old to hang out with her.\nYou\u2019ve already said you\u2019d take him.\nAsshole as fuck!!!", "Why of course you can drop your friends and family and all commitments because you met some girl at a wings place.  \n\nIn fact you should tell her to feel honored that you crushed the dreams of your 9 year old nephew in the change you might get lucky. I'm certain she'll be impressed.  \n\nYTA in case you can't read through the sarcasm.", "Is it possible you\u2019re using us as a test audience for a rom com screenplay you\u2019re writing? This doesn\u2019t seem real in any way, shape or form.", "YWBTA if you cancelled on your nephew.", "YTA if she is the one then when you explain you got caught up and forgot you had plans with your nephew she will respect you for being a good uncle. Conversely if you go hiking with her and it works out in the long run she will find out you let your nephew down and that will give her a negative opinion of you. If it is going to work out then you can wait a day.", "YTA. He\u2019s looking forward to this and it will be a highlight of his life (so far). You promised him and to break that promise will be a disappointment he will never forget. It will change your relationship with him forever and not in a good way. \n\nIf this girls is amazing as you think, she will understand and respect you for keeping your commitments.", "YTA. if this girl is a keeper she would want you to give your nephew a special memory. You would be a huge dick flaking on your nephew for a girl you just met.", "YWBTA. \n\nThink about how it\u2019s gonna look to your boss if you ghost his party after he was gracious enough to allow you to bring 2 extra guests. \n\nMore importantly, this is obviously a special, once in a lifetime kinda moment for your nephew. \n\nTell your new friend that you got caught up in the excitement and overbooked yourself. If she is understanding, then she is a keeper.", "YTA If she\u2019s not willing to reschedule the date, she\u2019s not worth it. And you\u2019re willing to f over a little kid to get laid, I\u2019d say you\u2019re not worth it. Wonder what the lady would think if she knew you disappointed a little kid to this extent?", "Dude....YTA\n\nIt's not like you don't know where she works or lives.  You will see her again.  Your nephew will never forgive you.\n\nYou say, \"Hey, you literally rocked my consciousness last night.  So much that I forgot I made a promise to 2 9 year old boys to take them to a Superbowl party.\n\nI made a promise and it would break their hearts if i cancelled.  I would love to see you again and, since I kinda screwed up here, would love an opportunity to make it up to you by doing your absolute favorite thing or hoping to your absolute favorite restaurant. \"\n\nBe a stand up guy.  She will appreciate it.", "Yes 1000% YWBTA!! You have permission to bring your nephew not a new gf. Set up plans to see this girl at a different time.", "YTA if this is true.  You don't do that to kids.", "YWBTA. You call her and explain the situation and that you cannot bail on your little nephew, and plan a date with her on another moment. If she dumps you over this you'll know she isn't as nice as she appeared, and no wife material after all.", "YTA. Always honor your previous commitments. Is it worth hurting your relationship with your nephew for seeing someone that you can easily see another day and who would understand your previous commitment to your nephew?", "YTA. Why don\u2019t you have her phone number or something? You can always reschedule a date, but never a Super Bowl with your football-crazy nephew. \n\nGoing on that date will show him where your priorities lie (and he\u2019ll think that he\u2019s not one of them).", "YTA.. There are plenty of other days in the year to go on a hike, but only one day for the party. Don\u2019t bail your nephew.", "YTA - Big time AH.

You're really, really fucking up here.", "YTA. Your word is everything to young children.  \n\nNot only will he remember this but he may learn by your example as he grows and matures. \n\nAt the very least he will know that you don\u2019t really mean what you say when you give your word to him.", "If she\u2019s as amazing as you think she is she will be pretty put off by your values if you ditch a promise to a child", "YTA.\n\nIf she can't understand you wanting to spend time with your Nephew AND that you made those plans first, you can do better.", "YTA.  I wouldn\u2019t want to date someone who would bail on an excited kid for me.", "YTA. Everyone else is covering the breaking your promise to your nephew part pretty well. But you should also consider that since your boss specifically mentioned that his friend loves meeting kids who love the game, he probably already told his friend that your nephew is coming. So if you don\u2019t show up with your nephew, you\u2019re going to make your boss look stupid, which isn\u2019t great professionally. \n\nPlus, ten bucks says this woman you\u2019ve known FOR LESS THAN 24 HOURS would run in the other direction if she got wind of your \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to marry her\u201d nonsense.", "YTA and also YAI\u2026 you\u2019re an idiot. Who asks someone to marry them after a few hours? Why would missing this date mean you never see her again (and who marries somebody who dumps them so easily)? Grow up, honor your commitment to your nephew and not the commitment to a complete stranger!", "Okay but seriously, if you just tell this girl \"hey I'm so sorry, I'm really into you so I said yes without thinking but I couldn't bail on my nephew like that, can we reschedule asap?\" you get so many brownie points.  Instantly more attractive for being able to communicate, being a good caretaker, and keeping things low drama and honest.  You'd be a fool to go on this date. Also YWBTA", "YTA. Keep your promises! If the girl is worth it, she will understand. You really want to crush that boy's happiness? He will remember. I guarantee it. Did anyone ever let you down when you were a kid? Do you remember how that felt? See how you still remember it? Don't do that to your nephew. Be a man of your word.", "YTA. You made the promise to your nephew beforehand.

There will be a million other chances for you to see this girl, don't disappoint your nephew who is really excited to go.", "YWBTA, go with your nephew, be honest with her. If she doesn't like it then bullet dodged. If she understands you have another good reason to see her as a keeper.", "YTA & not very bright. You should  know you hike during the day & the Super Bowl is in the evening.", "Yes, YWBTA. Honor your invitation to your nephew. Doing otherwise would show bad character, and if this woman is really someone you're serious about, you can just take her on a date later on. Honestly, if she found out that you ditched your nephew for her, and if she's a quality person, I think it would make her like you less. I already like you less for even considering this! Do the right thing. Your nephew will be in your life forever. This woman...perhaps not.", "This can\u2019t be real.", "YTA. You just met the girl and can see her any time.\n\nYou promised your nephew this once in a lifetime thing", "YTA. If she\u2019s as awesome as you think, she will be up for an earlier hike so you can keep your promise to your nephew.", "YTA, and if you skip to hike with her then once she realizes how important that party was to those kids she's gonna feel terrible about herself and you.\n\nShe goes every week, she likes you enough to ask to see you two days in a row & invite you on something incredibly personal... Just go the following week she's going to wait", "YTA \n\nKeep your promise to your nephew. Your nephew is more important than a stranger. Call your crush, apologize for double booking.. and arrange another date.", "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I\u2019ve accidentally double-booked. I promised my nephew, who loves football, that I would take him to a Super Bowl party where he could meet a former player. Can I join you next time instead?\u201d Is that so hard? YTA if this is actually real. You don\u2019t let a kid down who you\u2019ve known his entire life and will be part of his life forever (if you stop being an asshole) for a woman you just met. If you really think you could marry her, there will be plenty of other times to go hiking. You might only get this opportunity to do something that would be so fun for your nephew once, and he will forget it if you bail on him because some woman gave you butterflies. I guarantee she\u2019d understand and respect you more than if you ditched your nephew for her.\n\nSomeone else said it, but you also need to consider your manager\u2019s response. You asked to take your nephew, and if you don\u2019t show up because you found something more fun and double-booked, you\u2019re showing that you\u2019re unreliable and have poor time management/organisational skills.", "YTA. Your nephew probably can\u2019t even sleep because he\u2019s so excited about this. I don\u2019t even know him and it makes my heart hurt imagining his disappointment if you were to cancel. If this girl is a decent person at all, she won\u2019t care if you tell her you had plans with your nephew first. Call her and make plans for another day.", "I didn\u2019t even read the whole thing and immediate thought \u201cYTA\u201d. You already asked your nephew. Don\u2019t do that to him. Also, if I\u2019m the bartender and I find out you blew off your nephew and something like that for me, I\u2019m looking at your differently and not in a good way.", "Dude. Not only are yta massively... But if this lassie wouldn't meet you again because you were honouring a promise to a 9 year old then she's not worth it anyway. \n\nSo yta and your an idiot.", "Huge YTA", "Massively YTA.  Good lord did you really even need to ask?", "YTA. You made a commitment to your nephew that you\u2019re willing to break for a girl you hardly know. You are definitely an asshole and if she found out she\u2019d probably think you were too.", "Do not skip with your nephew. He's a child, she's an adult. As a female, if you told me you cancelled these plans, I wouldn't want to see you again. YTA if you do this", "YTA Be an adult and tell the girl that you made other plans and that you are man of your word and get your nephew to that party. Also wtf is that you won't get to see that girl again if you say no? Just effing come clean and make another date. If she is the one why are you giving so easily of her? Also you understand that you gonna crush your little nephews heart? I wouldn't wonder if he started to dislike you. This situation is so easy to solve but you are being just super overdramatic.", "Of course YWBTA. You committed to plans with your nephew; you can't back out just because you're bad at managing your schedule (I say this with empathy as someone bad at managing your schedule). Just tell this girl you forgot you had plans with your nephew and ask to hang out on a different day. If you're really \"going to marry her,\" she should be able to handle that.", "Ain\u2019t no way the guy is asking if breaking a big promise to a 9yo for a girl he met literally yesterday that he already wants to marry (Bro, she probs used a love potion or you\u2019re just thinking with your dick Idk) is being an AH, obviously YTA like wtf", "YTA. You can hang out with her any other day. You can only take your nephew to the party on this day. If she\u2019s as great as you think she is she\u2019ll understand", "YWBTA and even worse, you\u2019d be a bad uncle who doesn\u2019t keep his promises. Your nephew will never forget, you\u2019ll have an asterisk next to your name always.", "I can't believe you are even considering breaking your nephews heart over a girl you've known for less then 24 hours YTA", "Yup YTA\n\nThat girl should understand that you already promised a little boy a special day...\n\nShe can go on her normal solo hike. This should have no impact on a budding relationship but it would definitely hurt your nephew, most likely piss off his mother and possibly even make your boss raise an eyebrow if you cancel. \n\nYou're being selfish. It's not a good look.\n\nEdit: btw at the point that you invited her to \"go with us\" you were thinking about your nephew. You didn't forget about him. She said no, asked you to do something else instead and you jumped on board with it. So if you want to sit there claiming you're so bedazzled that you forgot him... just stop. You absolutely remembered him. She knew you had plans and asked anyway. Sounds like you're both AHs to me after reading it the second time.", "YTA.\n\nIf this woman is worth your time, she will understand the situation. And she would not respect you if she found out you broke a promise to hang out with her today.", "YTA. You literally just met her, and you think you\u2019re going to marry her? Sorry? That is such a red flag. \nYou already solidified these plans with your nephew. If this woman is so great she will respect you putting your CHILD NEPHEW first and probably think better of you for it. Don\u2019t fuck this up.", "YTA. If I knew someone I just met bailed on their nephew for me? I wouldn't continue seeing them.\n\nIf she won't see you because you keep plans you already had with a child, then she's not a good person.", "YTA. How would you think you're not TA in this scenario? Break this promise to your nephew and be prepared to have a distant relationship with him and your brother for a while. You are going to break a promise with a family member for a woman you just met. And come on, you're in love and going to marry her? What are you, 14 years old?", "Tell you what, if the love of your life bails on you for honoring a promise you made to a child, maybe this is a good thing.  \n\n\nUnless absolutely unavoidable, do not break a promise made to a child.    \n\n\nYes, you would absolutel be the AH if you ditch your nephew.  100% AINEC", "YTA don\u2019t break a child\u2019s heart.", "Asshole for even asking the question\n\nYTA", "YWBTA\n\nYou remembered the party well enough to ask her to go with you, but you forgot the two kids you promised to carry to the party?\n\nIf you're being honest with us, did you forget the kids, or did they rank so low in importance than you decided to ditch them to keep this lady's attention?\n\nYou get to make the choice. just remember, you may NOT marry this girl, you may never even date her officially. That's not a guarantee. But you would have broken two kids' hearts because you chose to chase someone for some fun. Don't blame anyone else, no matter what the outcome, like her ghosting you in the future, the kids hating you for years. These are the choices and consequences you're signing up for. Don't complain later.", "YTA. If this woman is as perfect as you claim, she'll understand and be 100% willing to reschedule. If she doesn't understand, then now you know one of her serious flaws and maybe she actually kind of sucks. Either way, keeping your promise to your nephew is the winning move.", "Not only would YBTA but if I were that girl, I\u2019d think long and hard about any future relationship with you. Breaking a child\u2019s heart over a girl I just met would show your loyalties are skewed.", "YTA, didn\u2019t even need to read your story to know that.

On the other hand, when she was given the option to join you for the game, she had to keep up a tradition of a hike?!? Something you can literally do any day of the year? I'm not so sure things went as well for HER.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. If someone went on a date with me and crushed their nephew's dream in the process, I would think differently (badly) of them. If this is the girl you'll marry, she'll wait. If she doesn't, you really wanna marry someone who'll crush someone's fun?", "YWBTA to bail on your nephew. Whatever you decide, he will never forget this. \n\nYou should call this woman and tell her you can\u2019t go because you already had plans to take your nephew and it is important to him. You shouldn\u2019t have said yes in the moment, but did because you like her so much. Then ask to see her soon. Make the plans. \n\nShow that you are the kind of man that will honor his commitments, own up to his mistakes, and make things right. \n\nBesides, she regularly hikes solo so it\u2019s not like she won\u2019t get to go if you don\u2019t go. Your nephew oh the other hand will miss out if you don\u2019t go. And he will be at a minimum bummed and slightly less trusting of you.", "Oh course you're the asshole.  Cancelling on your nephew so you can get your dick wet.  You won't stay with her anyways.", "I can't believe you're even considering this. I can tell you that If I was that woman and found out what you did I'd be disgusted.", "Jesus Christ just wank one out and forget about her. Your nephew is your family and take priority. YWBTA", "Oh buddy, YTA.\n\nYou made a promise to a child. It's nothing to you, I'm sure, but to your nephew, it was an absolute promise. You break this and he might never trust you again. If you really love the little guy, keep your effing promise to him.\n\nIf this girl can't understand what a prior commitment it, especially when it involves close family, then she's not the one. I'm CF but there's no way I'd be okay with a guy bailing on a promise he made to his nephew just to get laid. (Whether you're already thinking about the future or not, that's what this boils down to.) That shows immaturity and selfishness, imo. And it makes you seem flaky too. If you can't keep a simple promise to a 9 year old because it's slightly inconvenient, why should I trust you?", "YWBTA and there\u2019s an easy fix. Just call and tell her that in your excitement you forgot you\u2019d made this promise. Reschedule the hike, tell her you\u2019ll join her on the next one. Make a firm plan with her. Then send her a pic or two of you and nephew at the game.", "\u201cI was having such a nice time with you last night that I totally forgot I promised my little nephew I\u2019d take him to a Super Bowl party today.

I know I would be pissed if someone made promises to my kid and then blew them off for a stranger) for a hiking trip with this woman you just met. She says she always takes the day off for these hiking trips. That means she\u2019s going to be doing it again, maybe even soon. Explain to her you made a promise to your nephew you can\u2019t break and you momentarily forgot about it because you really want to spend more time with her. Ask for a rain check for the hike and go with her another time. If she doesn\u2019t understand and accept your reason for needing to postpone then she is a trash person and isn\u2019t someone you should want to be with anyway.", "\"I'm in love\" after one date.

This gal can wait a day.", "YTA: When this girl finds out you screwed over your nephew and his friend, she\u2019ll be disappointed in your lack of character, and won\u2019t want to see you again.

Knowing you keep your promises. YTA", "YTA but if u insist on being an asshole then at least make it up to your nephew\n\nYes, cancelling plans that you made with your nephew to attend the Super Bowl because you met a girl last night would likely be seen as being inconsiderate. It's important to prioritize your commitments and keep your promises, especially when they involve someone who is close to you, such as your nephew.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that your actions have consequences, and that cancelling on your nephew could damage your relationship with him.

My boss is hosting a Super Bowl party and he went to college with a guy who was a pretty decent sized name in the NFL in mid 2010s. I asked my boss if my nephew could come and he said this player loves kids who the love the game so for sure. I told nephew and he\u2019s been so excited.\n\nPart 2: I stayed in last night and decided to get take out from a local \u201cchicken wing place.\u201d Order was 7 shades of screwed so as I waited for them to fix it I started chatting with the bar tender and we hit it off big time. Like as in she was getting off work and she asked me if I wanted to come watch last of us with her at her apartment. Quite literally the funnest night of my life because it was so easy. We made blanket forts and popcorn and watched the show. I\u2019m going to marry her without question. I asked her if she wanted to come to the party with us and she said she always takes the day off to go solo hiking but asked if I wanted to come. Without even thinking of my nephew I said yes.\n\nI left her house being totally in love and excited to see her again but then it hit me that I can\u2019t do both. One one hand if I skip the date I don\u2019t get to see this girl again and risk that but if I don\u2019t take my nephew it will break his heart. But if I\u2019m being honest I would much rather be outside with her than in a room watching a game I don\u2019t care about.\n\n\nAITA if I cancel the plans with my nephew?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You made a promise to your nephew, and it's not a good look to anyone - family, boss, ex pro who's looking forward to meeting an excited fan, OR a potential love interest - to break your promise because you want some more booty.

You know you are, but you're gonna go with her anyway because you're horny.  Just know that kids have an extremely long and selective memory.", "YTA. You already have a commitment to your nephew.

Can we go out for dinner on Monday instead?\u201d\n\nThen, you can see if you can go on the hike with her next weekend. Speaking for myself it is a huge green flag if someone is so caring and good with kids. It\u2019s a giant red flag if they are willing to break a kids heart over something so selfish. If you\u2019re honest with her, she won\u2019t mind the cancellation and I\u2019m sure be more than willing to reschedule.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nYou made a commitment to TWO people, then want to drop them because you're thinking with your little head and not your big one.\n\nGrow up, tell the girl you made a mistake and that you can meet up with her another time.
