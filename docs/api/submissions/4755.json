When we first started dating, we both discussed the most important thing to us and it was traveling. Unfortunately, we just have different ideas of what traveling is.\n\nI work remotely, but I make 6 figures a year, so it's worth it. Plus the benefits are amazing. I get about a month off a year in PTO which is almost unheard of in the US. So I usually like to use my PTO to travel the world.\n\nMy husband works for 2 months and then has the next month off. With every new site we get to move to another state and that\u2019s his favorite thing. He gets paid a lot less than me but he says it doesn't matter because he's living the dream.\n\nI used to align my vacation days with his month off so we could travel together. This is the first year that I deliberately planned my vacation days when he works. Here's why.\n\nOur first year of dating, I wanted to do something small. We traveled to some of the national parks and had a wonderful time. It was gorgeous and he loved it just about as much as I did.\n\nThe next year, we decided to visit England. He was insufferable. All he did was complain about everything. It was a nightmare and every day he'd find something to complain about until eventually I cut the trip short and just took him home.\n\nI thought maybe he just didn't like England so I tried a few different countries over the next 3 years and he acted like a baby every single time. We went to Italy, Greece, and China, but he hated everything. I gave up and just told him to plan our next vacation.\n\nHe took me to Disneyland, his hometown, Las Vegas, and Florida. Nothing outside of the continental US.\n\nI never complained about any of his vacations. I went in with an open mind but always came home feeling a little cheated out of an experience. I mean, I haven't *really* gotten to enjoy one of my vacations in 5 years and I feel like I'm missing out.\n\nSo I scheduled my vacation for January (not one of the months he\u2019s off) and have plans to fly to France. I told him from the start this was happening, but I guess this entire time he thought I was joking.\n\nNow he\u2019s begging me not to go. He told me that he would miss me too much. I told him I just wanted to enjoy a vacation. And besides I was only gonna be gone for 2 weeks. I wasn't even gonna use up my entire vacation time in France. I was gonna spend the first and last week of my vacation with my husband.\n\nHe threw a tantrum when I told him I was still gonna go for the 2 weeks as my boss had already approved it. He said I might as well stay in France and then called his mother. She called me an hour later to yell at me and I had to explain myself.\n\nAnd now his whole side of the family is arguing with each other about it. Even his mom and dad are fighting about it. I just feel like this whole thing has gotten way too out of control and I may be the AH for starting all this family drama.", "created_utc": 1671072982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zma978/aita_for_planning_a_vacation_without_my_husband/", "score": 1055, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're allowed to want to explore and enjoy foreign experiences and culture without your partner. Especially a partner who just shits on these awesome destinations and complains. \n\nYou're certainly not the asshole for starting any family drama, mainly because you aren't the one who called mommy to tattle. She had no business calling to yell at you. Their family dispute is on your partner's shoulders, not yours. \n\nGO ENJOY FRANCE!", "NTA\n\n> With every new site we get to move to another state and that\u2019s his favorite thing.\n\n#GET to?\n\nThat sound like a fucking nightmare.", "NTA. You did not start the family drama, your husband did when he went and told mommy. It's not like you sprang this on your husband. Couples have different interests and taking two weeks to yourself to go enjoy another country that your husband would not enjoy sounds pretty reasonable.", "NTA after you said he got his mom into it. nope y\u2019all are adults he doesn\u2019t need to his mom to come sort out the situation. It is perfectly reasonable to want to enjoy your vacation out of the country he doesn\u2019t like leaving the country so it makes sense to go without him and your still spending time with him also what is his profession that sounds cool", "NTA for causing the Civil War in his family. Entertaining that they are taking sides so seriously. \n\nInfo: If reddit says your NTA do you expect your husband to just be okay with it and there to not be any consequences?\n\n\nGiven his dad is with you I think he recognizes your husband isn't in for the same kind of travel as you. You're NTA", "NTA\u2014and take me with you!! Seriously though\u2014why does he hate leaving the continent? And why is he angry at you for going somewhere he isn\u2019t going to enjoy without him? You told him before hand\u2014it\u2019s not like it was a surprise. And then running to mommy? He  sounds like a whiny little brat.\nEnjoy France\u2014eat all the pastries!!", "NTA.  But I question your choices a bit.\n\nSo, let\u2019s recap.  Your spouse has literally four months off per year.  During one month period, when he is working, you will be gone for two weeks.  He is begging you not to go as he would miss you too much.  When you stand firm, he calls his mom.  Who you \u201chad to explain yourself\u201d to and she yelled at you.\n\nWTF!  He tasked his mom to berate and intimidate you on his behalf.  The people who started the family drama here are mom and son, not you.\n\nIs this really the relationship you want to be in?", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your husband doesn\u2019t like international travel while it\u2019s your specific joy.  I\u2019ve been in the military as active then spouse, and the idea that a person can\u2019t be away from their spouse for two weeks is baffling.", "NTA. I would have gone ESH had you not spoken to him before and with him initially not making a deal of this. At this point, I'm wondering why you're even married.", "NTA. The escalation of this argument is alarming. You are beyond allowed to pursue your adventures. Travel is a lifelong pursuit and he\u2019s been completely impossible on your past foreign trips. So do your own thing and his parents don\u2019t get a say in it. \n\nAnd have a think about a man who tells you to stay in France and acts like a baby by spoiling your trips abroad and then calls his mommy when he doesn\u2019t get his way. Is this what you want?", "NTA - It's bad enough that he's this inflexible and insufferable now and gets his mommy involved when things don't go his way, but imagine how he'll act if you ever have kids with him. Yikes!", "NTA - the fact he called his mom tells me all I need to know\u2026 traveling is expensive and should never be wasted. If he doesn\u2019t know how to be mature on a trip then he should be able to sit it out. A lot of red flags here tbh.", "NTA. But the statement \u201che must have thought I was joking\u201d seems to kind of gloss over some significant communication issues. He knew you were planning this, and decided the best course of action was to ignore it, hope you change your mind, and then freak out at the last minute if you actually went through with it. \n\nPersonally, I think doing anything with someone who doesn\u2019t want to be there or isn\u2019t enjoying themselves is pretty terrible. I am a huge proponent of, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t go..\u201d but don\u2019t expect people to accommodate your shitty attitude. And on the flip side, if I\u2019m not getting with the program I cant get mad for doing something without me. \n\nYour husband cant have it both ways:\nhe either needs to significantly improve his attitude or stay home. He cannot dictate that you may not do things because he doesn\u2019t enjoy them. His mother should have told him this a long time ago, maybe they can talk about it on the phone.", "NTA \n\nI wouldn't want to look back and regret not being able to see things because my other half is a home body. \n\nGetting the family involved is a bit underhanded. \n\nAt the end of the day, just because you're married, doesn't mean you have to be joined at the hip for everything. If he's going to be intolerable going on the trips and not have a good time, why go?\n\nDon't short yourself just because he is happy with mediocrity.", "This is a much bigger problem than misaligned vacation expectations\u2026 NTA, but consider whether this is the right spouse for you.", "NTA. You've given him five years worth of vacation joy. He goes to cry to mommy and this becomes a family wide thing? What the hell is up with that?", "NTA of course, for all the reasons the other nta commenters have named. But also this:\n\nINFO: when he said you should just stay in France, was that code for he wants a divorce? Like, in a \u201cwell fine, if you\u2019re gonna be that way then I don\u2019t want you to come back!\u201d", "NTA, but you would be TA if you stay with this guy.", "NTA.  And he\u2019s an asshole for crying to his mom about your personal marital issues.  I\u2019d point out what a buzz kill he was on your vacations.  Go to France and enjoy your vacation!", "Nta enjoy your travels", "Info: have you ever talked to him about how insufferable he has been on your international vacations? Has he had an opportunity to improve, or did you suffer in silence? Have you tried traveling to the same destination but splitting up how you spend your days?\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward NTA, because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with planning a trip on your own when you were transparent with him and he didn\u2019t seem to raise an issue. But it kind of sounds like maybe you are ready to write off international travel with him altogether, and I can\u2019t tell if you have been open enough with him to justify that.", "NTA\n\n\u2026but the problem here isn\u2019t your vacation it\u2019s the communication or lack thereof surrounding it. You need to have a compassionate conversation with your husband and get to the bottom of why he\u2019s having a tantrum. Even if he will be lonely, it isn\u2019t your responsibility to be everything all of the time to him. I suspect something more is bothering him though since he didn\u2019t seem to have an issue with this vacation initially.", "NTA. What exactly does he expect with how he acted in the past when you chose the destinations? Sounds like he\u2019d rather you just let go of the places you wanted to visit in life and just do/go exactly what/where he wants.", "NTA, but I can see how the situation makes your husband uncomfortable. I definitely think better communication was warranted, and for me personally, it would be very strange if my spouse wanted to take a trip solo. I would be much more understanding if he wanted a friend/family member to go with, but going solo is something I\u2019d find weird. You and your spouse clearly enjoy traveling differently, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should keep him in the dark and make travel plans without telling him. It will definitely drive a wedge between you two.\n\nEDIT: misread the first time. You told him from the start, and clearly he didn\u2019t take you seriously. Him not taking you seriously is a communication problem. Like I said, NTA but considering all of the commotion this caused DESPITE you telling him, he needs to actually \u201chear\u201d you in the future. Anyway, France is amazing and I hope you eat well and take in all of the beauty it has to offer!!", "INFO\n\nThis is a tough one for me. If my husband (disclaimer: I'm no longer married but \\*if\\* I was) planned a two-week vacation to France without me, there would be divorce papers waiting for him. I would be livid.\n\nMy question is, have you explained why beforehand? Did you tell him how his behavior ruins it for you? I feel like this is something that should have been discussed in depth so that you could both come to a mutual agreement since marriages are about compromise. And if he is this upset about it, as I would be, I don't think you should go unless you are okay with the potential dissolution of your marriage.\n\nBut I do completely understand where you are coming from. If my spouse behaved in such a manner during these trips, I would want to go alone next time as well! And I think this would be possible with in-depth discussions on the matter beforehand to avoid these hurt feelings.", "Ill go the unpopular route with ESH. He shouldnt have whined to his mom and caused all the family drama. He also could have acted much better on your planned vacations. I think that you should have communicated better & had him go with you. It seems like this trip tactic is more avoidance than collaboration. Youre a married couple.", "Pretty sure OP flipped the gender roles here. OP is the husband.", "NAH\n\nDon't be surprised if this strains your marriage. Especially considering you did this intentionally.", "YTA for marrying a giant toddler.

Depending where they live in the US, they could also potentially avoid any jet lag that might be contributing to his bad attitude. \n\nI think OP should also try to visit the more far flung places on her own, but when they travel together both should try to find something that would satisfy them instead of one person being miserable.", "Probably he thinks the husband is wrong but doesn't want to call a MAAAYUNN an asshole, so figures it must really be the woman.", "Hopefully they live in a state where she won\u2019t be screwed over.
