My brother (M26) and father (M57) both are a bit on the heavier side, but I have never used that against them before and it\u2019s never been a big issue.\n\nLast week my parents and brother came over for a surprise visit and I happened to forgo wearing a bra since it was just me at home loafing in my room and reading stuff. They wanted to stay a while and chat/ have tea in the apartment so I didn\u2019t really see a reason to put on a bra still.\n\nFast forward a while and I notice my mom is giving me a look. I wasn\u2019t wearing anything particularly see through or thin, it was just a regular graphic-tee of my favourite hot sauce and some shorts. My mom told me to go change since it was inappropriate for me to be wearing \u201cso little\u201d with men in the house. I told her politely at first that I didn\u2019t think it was anything weird and I used to wear these exact clothes at our house all the time not that long ago and she never said anything. But then she started going off on a tangent about how I wasn\u2019t little anymore and I couldn\u2019t get away with having them just \u201cswinging around\u201d. \n\nWe argued a bit about it because I really can\u2019t be bothered to put on a bra during the weekend when I have no plans on going anywhere, but she kept insisting that I was being a terrible host and \u201cexposing myself\u201d. My dad and brother were also on her side (brother more reluctantly) and just told me to do what she wants and it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I just felt so done and stressed at this point that I snapped \u201cIf I have to wear a bra in my own house because of my chest then so do dad and bro.\u201d I could tell right away that my comment made my dad feel hurt, and I did feel immensely guilty afterward, but I still don\u2019t think I should have had to put on a bra for a surprise visit when they were going to leave soon anyways. My brother tells me that I took it too far and I should\u2019ve just either ignored her or changed for that little while they were visiting. My mom also still refuses to talk to me until I apologize for my inappropriate comment. AITA?\n\n**EDIT: After reading through a lot of the comments (and boy are there a lot more than I thought there\u2019d be) I\u2019d just like to clarify a few things!**\n\n1. When I said my brother and dad were backing up my mom, my dad was very vocally backing her up and enforcing this need to wear a bra behaviour. He and my mom are just afraid that if I am not wearing a bra when they\u2019re around, I probably won\u2019t for other guests and that makes me immodest. My brother just sided with them because he already gets on my moms nerves enough for other reasons so he didn\u2019t want to draw any fire.\n\n2. My mom is the type of person who even wears bras to sleep so to her, wearing one really isn\u2019t a big deal and she often says that not wearing one will lead to a saggy chest in the future. Her comment wasn\u2019t really meant to be a jab at the men\u2019s ability to keep it in their pants, it\u2019s really just her own thoughts on the matter.\n\n*That said, thank you for some of the comments also calling me out. I will definitely apologize to my brother and maybe my dad since it was unnecessary to my mom\u2019s level.*\n\n**EDIT 2: I am not sure if I wasn\u2019t clear in the post but I live alone in an apartment away from my parents and brother.

I can sympathize with his behavior because I\u2019ve been in almost this exact situation with my own sister, although a different argument. I wouldn\u2019t blame him for much besides maybe slight cowardice.\n\nThe only thing I would apologize for is saying the guys should wear bras. As for how to go about explaining your right to wear what you want in your own household to your mother, I honestly don\u2019t know since I just see that blowing up again. Maybe try wearing *only* a bra and underwear the next time your mom visits and see what she thinks.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, \"surprise visit\"- aka, they showed up without permission.\n\nSecond of all, even with reading your edits, what your mom is doing is sexualizing you to your own dad and brother. It is not her business whether you have a bra on for other guests, her conservative nature is not your responsibility. They showed up unannounced, then expect you to accomodate *their* creepy standards in *your* living space? BFFR!!\n\nThird, honestly what you said about your dad and brother is funny, if immature. If anything, I'd have said \"I don't have to wear a bra, my boobs aren't saggy,\" then look at your mom suggestively.", "Well NTA but you could have approached it differently. Some times parents take some time to realize that they can not set rules for you anymore. Your mom sounds a bit controlling so she will be hard to change. \n\nI think you did well not not put the bra on. It is your body and your house. But you also insulted your brother and dad instead of the root of the issue: your mom. \n\nIn your position I would flatly explain to her that if she does not like my hospitality she can go to her own place and wear all the bras she wants. If I felt particularly humorous I would go to my room and put on a bra on top of the shirt as a belt or something. If she kept on I would again flatly let her know \"mom. I love to bits but you don't make the rules here.\". \n\nExcept if they pay for your rent or something like that at which point her good will is necessary put on the freaking bra and let them know that you don't accept surprise visits \"because I can't be sure that I will modest when you arrive\". Then stop answering the door if they haven't called you first. Or even better if they ever come back unannounced keep the door locked say \"sorry I am not modest right now I have to change\". And take your sweet time changing. 30'? 45'? 1h? However long it is necessary for your mom to be positively upset then answer with a dress makeup and shoes on. And in the unavoidable conversation that will ensue remember: she can not get it was her idea all along.\n\nP.S. For whoever needs to hear this: It is not rude to welcome guests without a bra on. It is not rude to never put one on in your life.

Not because you don't want to wear a bra, but because it seems like you were the one who decided to include your dad and brother. \n\nThis was an argument between your mom and you.

We all have them.", "NTA.  \nAs for your dad and brother being hurt about your comment, on the one hand I understand that it sucks to feel shame about your body image, and it is probably something they are sensitive about.  \nOn the other hand, they were more than willing to jump on team mom and make *you* feel shamed in your *own house* after they stopped by unannounced, for *not wearing a bra*?  \nSo my empathy cup runs a little dry there.  \n\nAs for your mother. Her hang ups and feelings about modesty and bras are hers alone.  \nShe can wear a bra 24/7. Power to her.  \nBut that empowerment does not extend to shaming, berating and judging *you* for your choices.  \nEspecially in your own home.  \n\nYou know your mother best, and whether it's worth telling her your boundaries. Just laying them out like \"Mom, my body is mine and what I do with it and how I adorn it is my choice. I will not be insulted, humiliated and will not tolerate having my bodily autonomy removed in my own home. If you cannot respect me, how I dress my body, or my autonomy, then you will no longer be welcome in my home. From now on if you do come to my home, any comments about my body or how I'm dressed will not be entertained, and you will have to leave.\"  \n\nBasically a firm \"I won't be shamed in my own home\" while outlining the problem behaviour with the new consequence. That way she can either continue the behaviour (in which case, tell her to get the hell out of your home/hang up the phone), make excuses (don't entertain those, just restate the boundaries clearly, ask if she understands, and ignore redirection attempts) or she can get mad and cry foul about how mean you are/unfair it is etc. In which case, see \"get the hell out of my home\" hang up phone etc.  \n\nYour dad and brother aren't innocent bystanders here. They are complicit in your mother's behaviour, which is degrading you and humiliating you by telling you that you are incapable of good judgement (being a \"bad host\" which, the audacity, when they failed every part of being good guests), shaming you for your body, for your clothes, for your breasts (which are literally a natural part of your body, and are only sexualised by social dynamics and those who find sexual gratification from them), and generally taking away your autonomy and attempting to power over you.  \nAnd your dad and brother, instead of seeing this and going \"wow that's not okay, I am going to say something, my sister/daughter who I love and care about should not be treated this way\", go \"yeah put a bra on, listen to mom\".  \n\nIf they're upset because they've got moobs, then maybe they can use some of that hurt and mirror time to invest in some empathy. Cause moobs are shamed as part of being \"unattractive\", yet you are being shamed for a part of your body that is literally *going to be there no matter what*, and that you will receive attention from all sorts of people for- 99% of which will be unwanted, invasive, and threatening to your bodily autonomy.  \n\nYou're absolutely NTA.  \nDad and bro can be sad and maybe it will help them realise that saving their own asses the pain of angering your mom by not going along with her awful shaming of her own daughter sucks.  \nMaybe not.  \n\nBut you don't have to tolerate any of this.
