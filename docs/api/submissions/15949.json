I have kept a few of my breastfeeding singlets though and will wear and sleep in them sometimes when I need support but my neck and back can't handle a bra (like right now). I'm an Australian 18C-D depending on the cup style which is a 40 in UK/US sizing", "I have nothing against bras. I just hate feeling uncomfortable and restricted (plus it screws up my breathing when my asthma is playing up).", "Some of the first European settlers in North America were prudish religious conservatives and we've never gotten completely away from that.", "Male nipples are also sexy and an erogenous zone and they don't exist to feed babies so male nipples should be more sexualized and more urgently hidden", "They don't exist! Spooky!", "My mother has walked around in her underwear my entire life, as has my father, briefs not boxers. They continue to do this when getting dressed for an event like hey did you finish ironing my pants etc walking around the house to the laundry and they don't have an en suite bath that every bathroom trip was across the house and they had to walk past our bedrooms. Yep lots of in underwear moments. A thousand. Before I was old enough to remember I'm sure I saw them naked too, you can't convince a toddler to let you change by yourself or often let you use the bathroom alone at all. The last time my son saw me naked was 8 hours ago and he was asking questions like \"Where's mommy's penis?\" So we're at the stage now we're I'm really thinking about nudity and our takes on it and what we teach our kids. I really want him to know the names of his body parts as soon as possible so he feels ownership and can tell me if something's wrong. I don't want him to feel any shame.", "I took the suggestion that the boys wear bras too as an equalizer, not an intentional attack on their weight. OP was making the point of \u201cwell if I have to wear a bra in my own home, than all my guests should too\u201d. Dad and brother seem to be very sensitive about their own feelings, but not particularly interested in OP\u2019s feelings. They should feel guilty about not standing up for OP and not deflect with their own feelings being hurt. That is a self-centered interpretation of the situation.", "You can buy non exercise versions too. They are super comfy and I never feel like removing them when I get home anymore. Even expensive regular bras are annoying", "Thank you for the recommendations!  I have very bad acid reflux so the fact that you have it too and still feel comfortable is a great endorsement!  I will definitely look up these brands, especially Yvette.", "Oooh, thank you for this. I've just bought a pack of IUGA sports bras and capri leggings.\nI knew Reddit would child in handy!! \ud83d\ude0a", "Do those come in 32I size too?", "Ha, a little hug sounds nice!  That's how I feel about my snug tank tops, so I know what you mean.", "I didn't mean for that to sound directed at you specifically. Sorry about that.", "Your parents and siblings aren't extended family though, they are part of your nuclear family. \n\nI think it's kind of unusal actually that you had never seen your mom topless. You never went to a gym or pool with her? It's pretty normal to have one big changing room there.\n\nAmerican films and television shows aren't really representive of how Americans actually live. We didn't watch Uncle Jesse on Full House take a whizz but I guarantee you that everyone in America urinates on a regular basis. It's just not something that you will see unless it's a plot point, and due to the fallout of the Hays code it limits the market of the film or show.", "well that's exactly the nuance of how the comment is made, haven't looked from this side and that actually makes sense. But then the title is not clear and maybe a bit misleading", "Yes, parents and siblings are your nuclear family. My first comment was to someone that said they've seen all of their extended family members nude. I wrote about how bizarre that would seem to most americans, as we don't see our extended family members nude. Then someone else wrote about their experience in their own home with their nuclear family.\n\nYeah I've been to the pool with her but I don't remember not being in a private stall and if I wasn't in a private stall I definitely wasn't looking at the other people there. I was just trying to handle my business and get changed", "I hope so. Or I would like to think so. My sister has three boys and the older two asked me when I had stubble and told me it was gross to have hair on my legs. We had a whole talk about that kind of logic. There's a lot of people that believe in this bullshit still and in my life they're the ones pushing out the highest number of kids per couple.", "They never tell you when you marry that your wife is guaranteed to be a hoody thief, and you need to buy more.  They should make that part of the preparation class things.", "Ahh, I feel ya. I buy mine at least 3 sizes too big and I am always cold anyways. It's the only reason they are tolerable for me.", "City chic bras look and feel great, but I\u2019ve noticed the last few years, they only last 6 months or so before the underwire pops out. \n\nA lot of my friends have had luck with Exotica/Empress Athletica compression tops and dresses. Lots of support, but no bra needed.", "I see, thanks for the clarification. I haven't seen any extended family at all for decades so I can't remember or speak to how they behaved. I just have a strong memory of aunties fighting over side dishes at the cookout and uncles playing cards.", "My hubby had to go out of town for a week when we had been living together for 6mths after doing 10mths long distance. He only had one hoodie so before he left he brought a second one and wore his old one all week before leaving. I slept in it every night he was gone. I was so upset when our puppy chewed it while teething so he brought another one that winter and we did it all over again."]}
