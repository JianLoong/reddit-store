As a result, my whole family (especially my SIL) make a very big deal out the twins, calling them \u201crainbow babies\u201d, showering them with attention and affection, almost to the exclusion of the other grandkids. I\u2019ve never really been as involved with this, mostly due to the fact that I live across the country.  \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m getting married soon! I\u2019m so excited, and my fianc\u00e9 and I have been diving into wedding planning. A conversation that my fianc\u00e9 and I had recently was the matter of the flower girl and ring bearer. I brought up the idea of having our dog Mika and our cat Tibby fill the roles. \n\nUnderstand, Mika and Tibby are like children to us! They helped me through my deepest depression, I honestly think I wouldn\u2019t be here anymore if I didn\u2019t have to stick around to take care of them. They kept my fianc\u00e9 company when he was going through chemo and I had to work double the hours to put food on the table. We love them to bits, and consider them family. My fianc\u00e9 thought it was a great idea, so that\u2019s what we decided to do. \n\nAnyway, I casually brought it up at a family get together, and my SIL took me aside later and asked why we gave \u201cAva and Liam\u2019s roles\u201d to our animals. I was confused, and she explained that, since Ava and Liam were \u201cher miracle rainbow babies\u201d that *obviously* they should be the flower girl and ring bearer. She said that it would be \u201cgood for the family\u201d for the twins to be in the wedding, and that it\u2019s \u201cagainst tradition to have animals in the wedding\u201d. She asked me to reconsider, and showed me a picture of Ava in a flower girl dress to \u201cshow [me] how cute it would be\u201d. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t make any decisions without my fianc\u00e9\u2019s input, then I changed the subject. \n\nI talked to my fianc\u00e9 about it, and he said he\u2019d be fine with Ava and Liam taking the roles, but that\u2019s he\u2019d prefer our animals. I agreed that I would prefer our animals. However, I\u2019m now wondering if maybe having our animals in the wedding would offend the family or go against tradition. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019d not be doing anything wrong, but my mind has been spinning lately, so I figured I\u2019d get some second opinions.", "created_utc": 1684882595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q3p8d/wibta_if_i_made_my_dogs_the_flower_girl_and_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This wedding is about you, not her miracle babies.\n\nThings are going to get rocky, but it's better SIL learns her kids aren't the main characters in everyone's lives before they get to school and they and her are rudely awakened. She is doing them no favours in the long run.", "NTA, but also consider if your pets are going to enjoy that experience or if it will be stressful and annoying to them. If they\u2019re going to like it, by all means go ahead. That\u2019s really the only question that matters.", "NTA\n\nYour niece and nephew might be the most important people to your SIL, but not to anyone else. She needs to realize that. You have no obligation to modify your wedding to accommodate her wishes, and if your family makes trouble about it, then you\u2019ll know who your real family is. Rest easy, and give Mika and Tibby pets from me.", "Nta but don't be shocked if everyone gets irrationally upset because it sounds like they're obsessed with the kids.", "It's your wedding.   You get to cast every role, invite every guest, pick every song, and pick the menu.    Have it how you want it.   YWNBTA to decline others suggestions for any aspect of it.", "NTA but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your family tries guilting you into changing your mind. Unfortunately, families come with a lot of biases and your preferences or desires come second if you want to keep the peace. If my dog lives long enough for me to ever get married, he\u2019s definitely my ring bearer - so I get it. At the end of the day, someone\u2019s always gonna have something to complain about and it\u2019s YOUR day!", "NTA, they aren't your children and it seems your SIL expects everyone to put them up on a pedestal.  At the end of the day it is yours and your fiancees wedding, not your SIL's.  You do you.", "NTA and your SIL is waaay out of line.  For kids this young, it often isn't even fun for them.  Or they get scared.  To be blunt, she's  playing the rainbow baby card.  It's possible to be super happy for her and love those kids, but you still get to plan your own damn wedding.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re from some very specific cultures that the selection of the names Ava and Liam doesn\u2019t suggest, your wedding sounds like a standard American wedding in line with standard American culture, and that means it isn\u2019t a \u201cfamily\u201d occasion foremost. It is a celebration of your relationship and you get to do whatever quirkiness you like.\n\nThe only reason you should reconsider is taking a long look at how comfortable your animals will be in a large, loud, crowded space; moreso if it is any journey away from home. Most dogs I\u2019d expect to be okay with that. Most cats? Absolutely not. That\u2019s a recipe for stress, distress and danger for a cat. What\u2019s the plan for where they stay before and after the ceremony? Who is going to sit with them? What\u2019s the plan if they escape into the venue, hide, and you spend the rest of your day worrying about your cat - or crying over a tragic accident?\n\nMaybe you have an unusually crowd-happy, adventurous cat with impeccable harness training, your venue is no more than fifteen minutes from home and you have a close friend or relative the cat is comfortable with to bring them for that brief bit of the ceremony and then take them home again. If your situation varies from that picture, take the dogs along and let your cat sit this one out.\n\nEven if you rethink the cat, don\u2019t put the kids in the wedding. SIL needs her expectations reset right now. Try something like \u201cSIL, you know how much we love the twins, but I want to be clear about their role in our wedding - much loved and valued guests, just like you are. If we want them to take on another role, we\u2019ll let you know in good time, but we don\u2019t have any plans for that at the moment.\u201d\n\nThen just be boring about her other objections and repeat yourself as many times as you need to, refusing to be drawn into the argument. It\u2019s good for the family? \u201cThat can be how you handle events you host, but our wedding will involve family in different ways that suit us better.\u201d It\u2019s tradition? \u201cThat\u2019s how you can incorporate your view of tradition at events you host, but our wedding will emphasise traditions that suit us better.\u201d They\u2019re rainbow babies? \u201cAnd we love them very much, and you can headline that fact in events you host, but we will be including them and the rest of the family in our wedding in ways that suit us better.\u201d\n\nJust keep hitting the same template note. No arguing with the basic point; just \u201cyes, I accept that that is YOUR emotionally charged fixation; and you can do that at your party. We will be doing something that suits us better.\u201d No reasoning, no getting baited into explaining, just *it suits us better*. \u201cWe prefer this\u201d is a complete explanation. As a follow up, don\u2019t forget to practice your \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d.", "NTA it is your wedding & I would absolutely guarantee that your SIL would make your day all about her \u201crainbow\u201d babies I think there are no \u201crules\u201d when it comes to weddings & as our fur babies are here with us for such a short time you should give them a role of honor if it makes you and your fianc\u00e9 feel good as for SIL she will throw a fit , guaranteed but you simply tell her this is not open for discussion it\u2019s your wedding and although you love your niece and nephew you have already filled those roles", "NTA.

Do they enjoy crowds? A lot of people moving around? Will they be comfortable in this role?

If you want your pets involved, then that's what you get. If your sil doesn't like it, she doesn't have to attend. \n\nIf you really want to compromise (though I don't think you should) you could leash your pets and let the kids hold the leashes down the isle. They could be the \"handlers\". You do things the way you want. Period.", "NTA for not including your niece and nephew. But you might be TA for putting your pets through this.

Your sister-in-law is taking advantage of her children being miracle children and pulling it out for every last single thing it seems like just to show up everybody. She needs to understand that this isn't about them but about you and your fiance. As to the pets, I think it would be kind of cute to see the pets be your flower girl and ring bearer. But you also need to keep in mind when you make your plans for your wedding, that the place you decide on to have the ceremony and or reception mana allow pets. You might want to check venues that will allow you to have your pets there and it's not a big concern. Also your pets may not like being in this position and it might be stressful for them or cause them to react in ways that you might not want to see at the wedding.

SIL has no call to demand anything from you, much less the inclusion of her 4-year-olds in your celebrations.", "YWNBTA. I think it's a great idea and also a very cute one. My only reservation is how do you get the cat go actually take the rings to you?\n\nAnyway, I say go for it! Enjoy your wedding your way!", "NTA \n\nThat's absolutely perfect! It's your wedding so you get to choose.", "NTA BUT Are your animals ok for such a thing? like is your cat harness trained? Is it going to be uncomfortable with so many people around? is there a plan for where they will be for the reception? just practical things to think about especially in regards to the cat. usually unless a cat has been desensitized to such a thing they are likely to get overwhelmed and possibly run off. if its an indoor wedding they could possibly climb up somewhere to hide, or an outdoor and they run off and your wedding day is spent searching for them. Dogs are much easier to train in this regard and I've seen dog ring bearers before. So NTA for not having it be you niece and nephew its your day I don't know you situation or your animals but just some questions to keep in mind.", "NTA. People need to stop making other people's big moments about themselves.", "NTA, it\u2019s your and your fianc\u00e9s wedding at the end of the day and you actually don\u2019t need to explain yourself when it comes to involving other peoples children in your wedding and deciding that your important family pets that you love will have roles in YOUR wedding.\n\nOn another note, this awfully off putting attitude from parents who think their children are ENTITLED to whatever they please because they are \u201crainbow babies\u201d are toxic. By all means, as parents I\u2019m sure you want your children to know they are deserving and deserve positive things but there is a major difference between feeling deserving in regards to self worth and feeling outright entitled to other peoples things(money, moments, celebrations etc) your child isn\u2019t a miracle, your case isn\u2019t special. Unless there is some major physicality that actually prevents you from having kids, like, a missing uterus or being a virgin or not having bio parts that are for having babies etc and SOMEHOW you are pregnant, than that\u2019s a miracle\u2026 it might be harder for some but that doesn\u2019t make it a miracle.", "it looks like it will offend some family members. and apparently tradition. but in the end , its ur day.
