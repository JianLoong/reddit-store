As a result, my whole family (especially my SIL) make a very big deal out the twins, calling them \u201crainbow babies\u201d, showering them with attention and affection, almost to the exclusion of the other grandkids. I\u2019ve never really been as involved with this, mostly due to the fact that I live across the country.  \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m getting married soon! I\u2019m so excited, and my fianc\u00e9 and I have been diving into wedding planning. A conversation that my fianc\u00e9 and I had recently was the matter of the flower girl and ring bearer. I brought up the idea of having our dog Mika and our cat Tibby fill the roles. \n\nUnderstand, Mika and Tibby are like children to us! They helped me through my deepest depression, I honestly think I wouldn\u2019t be here anymore if I didn\u2019t have to stick around to take care of them. They kept my fianc\u00e9 company when he was going through chemo and I had to work double the hours to put food on the table. We love them to bits, and consider them family. My fianc\u00e9 thought it was a great idea, so that\u2019s what we decided to do. \n\nAnyway, I casually brought it up at a family get together, and my SIL took me aside later and asked why we gave \u201cAva and Liam\u2019s roles\u201d to our animals. I was confused, and she explained that, since Ava and Liam were \u201cher miracle rainbow babies\u201d that *obviously* they should be the flower girl and ring bearer. She said that it would be \u201cgood for the family\u201d for the twins to be in the wedding, and that it\u2019s \u201cagainst tradition to have animals in the wedding\u201d. She asked me to reconsider, and showed me a picture of Ava in a flower girl dress to \u201cshow [me] how cute it would be\u201d. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t make any decisions without my fianc\u00e9\u2019s input, then I changed the subject. \n\nI talked to my fianc\u00e9 about it, and he said he\u2019d be fine with Ava and Liam taking the roles, but that\u2019s he\u2019d prefer our animals. I agreed that I would prefer our animals. However, I\u2019m now wondering if maybe having our animals in the wedding would offend the family or go against tradition. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019d not be doing anything wrong, but my mind has been spinning lately, so I figured I\u2019d get some second opinions.", "created_utc": 1684882595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q3p8d/wibta_if_i_made_my_dogs_the_flower_girl_and_my/", "score": 1620, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This wedding is about you, not her miracle babies.\n\nThings are going to get rocky, but it's better SIL learns her kids aren't the main characters in everyone's lives before they get to school and they and her are rudely awakened. She is doing them no favours in the long run.", "NTA, but also consider if your pets are going to enjoy that experience or if it will be stressful and annoying to them.

That\u2019s really the only question that matters.", "NTA\n\nYour niece and nephew might be the most important people to your SIL, but not to anyone else. She needs to realize that.

YWNBTA to decline others suggestions for any aspect of it.", "NTA but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your family tries guilting you into changing your mind. Unfortunately, families come with a lot of biases and your preferences or desires come second if you want to keep the peace. If my dog lives long enough for me to ever get married, he\u2019s definitely my ring bearer - so I get it.

At the end of the day it is yours and your fiancees wedding, not your SIL's.  You do you.", "NTA and your SIL is waaay out of line.  For kids this young, it often isn't even fun for them.  Or they get scared.  To be blunt, she's  playing the rainbow baby card.  It's possible to be super happy for her and love those kids, but you still get to plan your own damn wedding.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re from some very specific cultures that the selection of the names Ava and Liam doesn\u2019t suggest, your wedding sounds like a standard American wedding in line with standard American culture, and that means it isn\u2019t a \u201cfamily\u201d occasion foremost. It is a celebration of your relationship and you get to do whatever quirkiness you like.\n\nThe only reason you should reconsider is taking a long look at how comfortable your animals will be in a large, loud, crowded space; moreso if it is any journey away from home. Most dogs I\u2019d expect to be okay with that. Most cats? Absolutely not. That\u2019s a recipe for stress, distress and danger for a cat. What\u2019s the plan for where they stay before and after the ceremony? Who is going to sit with them? What\u2019s the plan if they escape into the venue, hide, and you spend the rest of your day worrying about your cat - or crying over a tragic accident?\n\nMaybe you have an unusually crowd-happy, adventurous cat with impeccable harness training, your venue is no more than fifteen minutes from home and you have a close friend or relative the cat is comfortable with to bring them for that brief bit of the ceremony and then take them home again. If your situation varies from that picture, take the dogs along and let your cat sit this one out.\n\nEven if you rethink the cat, don\u2019t put the kids in the wedding. SIL needs her expectations reset right now. Try something like \u201cSIL, you know how much we love the twins, but I want to be clear about their role in our wedding - much loved and valued guests, just like you are. If we want them to take on another role, we\u2019ll let you know in good time, but we don\u2019t have any plans for that at the moment.\u201d\n\nThen just be boring about her other objections and repeat yourself as many times as you need to, refusing to be drawn into the argument. It\u2019s good for the family? \u201cThat can be how you handle events you host, but our wedding will involve family in different ways that suit us better.\u201d It\u2019s tradition? \u201cThat\u2019s how you can incorporate your view of tradition at events you host, but our wedding will emphasise traditions that suit us better.\u201d They\u2019re rainbow babies? \u201cAnd we love them very much, and you can headline that fact in events you host, but we will be including them and the rest of the family in our wedding in ways that suit us better.\u201d\n\nJust keep hitting the same template note. No arguing with the basic point; just \u201cyes, I accept that that is YOUR emotionally charged fixation; and you can do that at your party. We will be doing something that suits us better.\u201d No reasoning, no getting baited into explaining, just *it suits us better*. \u201cWe prefer this\u201d is a complete explanation. As a follow up, don\u2019t forget to practice your \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d.", "NTA it is your wedding & I would absolutely guarantee that your SIL would make your day all about her \u201crainbow\u201d babies I think there are no \u201crules\u201d when it comes to weddings & as our fur babies are here with us for such a short time you should give them a role of honor if it makes you and your fianc\u00e9 feel good as for SIL she will throw a fit , guaranteed but you simply tell her this is not open for discussion it\u2019s your wedding and although you love your niece and nephew you have already filled those roles", "NTA.

They could be the \"handlers\". You do things the way you want. Period.", "NTA for not including your niece and nephew. But you might be TA for putting your pets through this.

Your sister-in-law is taking advantage of her children being miracle children and pulling it out for every last single thing it seems like just to show up everybody.

But you also need to keep in mind when you make your plans for your wedding, that the place you decide on to have the ceremony and or reception mana allow pets. You might want to check venues that will allow you to have your pets there and it's not a big concern. Also your pets may not like being in this position and it might be stressful for them or cause them to react in ways that you might not want to see at the wedding.

SIL has no call to demand anything from you, much less the inclusion of her 4-year-olds in your celebrations.", "YWNBTA. I think it's a great idea and also a very cute one. My only reservation is how do you get the cat go actually take the rings to you?\n\nAnyway, I say go for it! Enjoy your wedding your way!", "NTA \n\nThat's absolutely perfect! It's your wedding so you get to choose.", "NTA BUT Are your animals ok for such a thing? like is your cat harness trained? Is it going to be uncomfortable with so many people around? is there a plan for where they will be for the reception? just practical things to think about especially in regards to the cat. usually unless a cat has been desensitized to such a thing they are likely to get overwhelmed and possibly run off. if its an indoor wedding they could possibly climb up somewhere to hide, or an outdoor and they run off and your wedding day is spent searching for them. Dogs are much easier to train in this regard and I've seen dog ring bearers before. So NTA for not having it be you niece and nephew its your day I don't know you situation or your animals but just some questions to keep in mind.", "NTA. People need to stop making other people's big moments about themselves.", "NTA, it\u2019s your and your fianc\u00e9s wedding at the end of the day and you actually don\u2019t need to explain yourself when it comes to involving other peoples children in your wedding and deciding that your important family pets that you love will have roles in YOUR wedding.\n\nOn another note, this awfully off putting attitude from parents who think their children are ENTITLED to whatever they please because they are \u201crainbow babies\u201d are toxic. By all means, as parents I\u2019m sure you want your children to know they are deserving and deserve positive things but there is a major difference between feeling deserving in regards to self worth and feeling outright entitled to other peoples things(money, moments, celebrations etc) your child isn\u2019t a miracle, your case isn\u2019t special. Unless there is some major physicality that actually prevents you from having kids, like, a missing uterus or being a virgin or not having bio parts that are for having babies etc and SOMEHOW you are pregnant, than that\u2019s a miracle\u2026 it might be harder for some but that doesn\u2019t make it a miracle.", "it looks like it will offend some family members. and apparently tradition. but in the end , its ur day.

It's factually wrong.", "I have a feeling that they are going to spend at least 20 minutes of the ceremony chasing a freaked out cat trying to get the rings that are tied to it.", "Very easily.  Having worked in weddings when dogs were present it's hit or miss and the successful ones include a paid sitter that takes them home after the ceremony. I've seen them bark and bark and bark. I saw one lunge and attack. Then be stuck in a room where they barked all night.", "There' s different types of cats. My cat Micro is trained to go into medieval festivals in her maiden dress and accept courtsies with regal grace. No touching, indeed, and quick disinterest in the crowds, preferring  to nap in a shield after a while if the jesters bore her. My Remus, my beloved big boy, was a doggie knight and learned to pass me arrows from my quiver and the hidromiel bottle too, all handsome in his red cloak. He passed last year at 16  and I miss him so much, but he loved parties, the dancing and people. If you think your furry babies will enjoy, go on!", "My God daughter has a backpack cage thingy she takes her cat out in sometimes. Cat enjoys short stints in it.Maybe OP is thinking along those lines. Or a baby carrier. Cat ladies are creative.", "I\u2019ve had 3 cats who would have hated this and done poorly, one who would have been a maybe, and one who would have looked fabulous in his bow tie harness on a leash and not minded the people at all. Hopefully OP knows what to expect! \n\nI would recommend human escorts so everyone can be leashed though, just in case. And not the twins.", "That honestly raises flags for it as a service dog tbh but you do raise a valid point that even the most trained dogs that do okay in rehearsal can freak in the moment because they are animals - which is why even movie sets have multiple look alikes of the professionally trained animals. \nAnd for that, ESH especially given there\u2019s a cat involved. Hope OOP is ready to have her wedding ruined by the cat running away never to be found again \ud83e\udd74", "We already have plans to hire a petsitter just in case, but it\u2019s taking place at our home (budget backyard wedding) so I don\u2019t have too many concerns.", "More reason for OP to do this! :)", "\u201cAin\u2019t nothing gonna happen to these mf rings\u201d", "I immediately thought of it when I saw the title  \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b\ufe0f", "I love this idea!  That way SIL can\u2019t say that her kids can push the stroller. You can just use the remote control from the back!  Brilliant", "I think you're right here. \"SIL you are correct, it really isn't traditional to have my pets do. Other siblings kids can do it, they will look so cute\"\n\nYeah, that would work.", "I\u2019m seriously so excited!  The wedding is several years away but my job is set!  It\u2019s the best job!", "I should\u2019ve been clear those are the kids I meant", "I am also a \u201crainbow baby\u201d except that term didn\u2019t really exist when I was born. My parents seemed to have gotten a dog for each miscarriage so there were three canine siblings by the time I came along. Keep your plan OP and have your pets bring the rings.", "That would be the best part!", "My dog still gets spoiled because he spent 9 months  in a shelter. I'm sure he's forgotten but i never will. I'm very lucky he's such a polite sweetheart \ud83d\ude02", "Lol, it\u2019s entertaining to hear about which human foods cats like to snack on. My Bruce (RIP) looooooved pepperoni and orange juice.  If I was having a pepperoni and cracker snack, he would sit by my shoulder, and tap me to ask for a piece.", "\ud83d\ude02", "YES!! I bet one of the other kids would love to be in the wedding and their parents would love the sweet, sweet revenge of seeing Gods chosen children left on the sidelines!! When the hell did this Rainbow baby BS start?!!", "I would do this too! Get the other kids to walk the pets down the aisle. All of them if need be.  Cats can be sooooo fussy and it\u2019s an energetic dog don\u2019t ya know. Everyone BUT the rainbow babies. Then maybe sit the parents down and force them to watch bluey on repeat. Specifically the episode where their cousin muffin is a monster and to stop the behaviour their uncle points out that while she\u2019s the most special kid in the world to HIM she\u2019s not to anyone else.", "If OP picks 1 grandchild, they should pick all of them otherwise the kids will be upset. Little kids don't understand and might think OP doesn't like them. (Obviously OP and fianc\u00e9 can pick whoever they want but if they're close to the whole family and the grandkids are young, it could cause unnecessary drama).", "That was my first thought, it's all well & good as a parent to cherish the kids you have after hardship however anyone outside that won't care.  Especially the employer at their first job won't care they are rainbow babies.  OP NTA and should keep the original plan, like it would be good to see SIL face if the other grandchildren are involved but that might bring another form of drama", "Lmao same don't worry", "Why start a debate that's gonna get ugly between two sides that will never see eye to eye under a post that has nothing to do with that?", "For some of us, pets are definitely preferable.", "My children are 29/24/17. They are my babies. Fight me\n\nNTA Edit!", "Make the cat the flower girl and the petals will *definitely* get scattered far and wide!", "I have an orange tabby who would be totally up for something like this, especially if there was food and kids involved. But I\u2019d still probably keep him in a stroller.", "This would be, for me, the wedding of the century.", "i assume they're not going to give the cat the actual rings. at least at every wedding i've been to, the ring bearer carries either an empty ring box on their pillow or fake rings while one of the groomsmen has the real rings in their pockets.", "The dog really was the best service dog in the world. I honestly think he was hesitant to leave her, possibly because her behavior signaled something to him that he should stay by her side. But the crowd did make him nervous with all the high pitched \"awwww look at the doggy\" and she was pushing him away -- it was all so out of the ordinary. Dogs are dogs and even the best behaved can be unpredictable. \n\nIf it had been their other dog, it would have left his mark at every pew. \n\nBringing a cat, though, borders on cruel.", "You might want to add the fact that it\u2019s a backyard wedding and your cat is leash trained in the post. People are probably imagining you taking a cat to a church.", "When I was a kid it was always \u201cmiracle baby\u201d which feels even ickier. Double icky bc my poor older sister (10 year gap of miscarriages & drs saying it would never happen between us) bore the struggle of feeling less important bc of it.", ">When the hell did this Rainbow baby BS start\n\nIt wasnt meant to make that baby extra special. It was just a term for people to use when they finally had a kid that made it through the pregnancy. Some people are just prone to miscarriages. People obviously took it too far.", "it started at least 15 yrs ago, and is only meant to reference the baby being a rainbow after a storm. normally a miscarriage, still birth or Sid. Normal well adjusted people aren\u2019t still hung up it for years, demanding the world bend for their miracle baby. Source I\u2019ve never demanded things for my own rainbow baby, and only mention it when in reference to other people losing their minds over their own Rainbow babies\u2026 like what if you can make unreasonable demands so can I\u2026. And you neeeeed to because of my rainbow baby.", "Oh, this is GORGEOUS. This, OP, this!", "Excluding them would just be mean, though. Kids don't understand these things. Treating every kid equaly would be best.\nBut yeah, the episode is a must", "Such unnecessary pressure and I feel bad for these twins that are already pressured into things because of things that were entirely out of their control.", "As usual, people take a nice thing or term and make it their whole abnoxious personality"]}
