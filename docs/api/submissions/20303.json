The dress code is basically work out clothes, nothing with strings or lose fabric that can get caught. Now my daughter was wearing leggings and a runner shirt before I dropped her off. She snuck in a dress and changed into it at camp. Well that was a no go and the made her change back to her workout clothes or she couldn\u2019t do the activities. They also sent me a note saying we have other things to do and if it happens again she will be asked not to return.\n\nI agree with them 100 % but she has been going on about how they can\u2019t police her clothes and my husband and daughter things I am a jerk for not fighting the camp on the dress code.\n \nEdit she picked out the camp, I get a catalog about the summer camps and the kids pick what they want to do\n\nThank you to a suggestion, I sent my husband a video of rock climbing in a dress, this should make it really clear why she can\u2019t do that. Good news he gets it now, and gave an apology. We are going to talk about this and find a solution\n\nGot off a call with the camp, they gave a shop that has stuff that will be fine, there dresses are more body suits but it might work for her. They also suggested those one piece workout suits. Going to do a shopping  with her tonight. Hopefully she will like them, I did send a picture to ask if she likes it, so hopefully.\n\nThank you for everyone\u2019s advice\n\n\nUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, nothing she liked nothing. I put my foot down and told her she will wear workout clothes or she won\u2019t go anymore. She wants to go so unhappily she picked an outfit that was \u201c good enough\u201d.

Actually, they can and they have to.

She\u2019s old enough to understand that there\u2019s a time & place to be as cute as possible, and it isn\u2019t at an athletic day camp.", "NTA - the reason they \u201cdress coded\u201d her was likely for safety reasons so nothing gets caught during the aforementioned activities. It\u2019s not \u201cpolicing her clothes\u201d - it\u2019s ensuring her safety.", "NTA. She either wants to go to the camp or she doesn't.

She can follow the rules that apply to everyone or suffer the consequences. This isn\u2019t a body shaming or freedom of speech issue. It\u2019s a safety issue. Rock climbing  in a dress would be ridiculously unsafe and just obviously impractical. They have a camp full of  other campers to watch and adding this distraction is entitled behavior. A dress is also not appropriate for horseback riding, flips flops are not appropriate for track and field, and a bathing suit isn\u2019t appropriate to wear to play ice hockey. This is life. It\u2019s not about her but nice try using women who fought actual discrimination as her argument.", "NTA the dress code is for safety reasons. Absolutely reasonable.  Little missy needs to get over herself. She is old enough to understand the safety implications in this case", "NTA.Health and safety issues aside, I'd just pull her out of camp as a punishment as she is being Ta", "NTA- it sounds like it's more about safety than what might \"distract boys\" so no sympathy for her.  But does she really want EVERYONE looking up her skirt and possibly taking creep shots with their cell phones rock climbing?", "NTA it's a safety concern and it's honestly a very lenient dress code. It should be easy to follow.", "NTA but you might be raising one.", "NTA. In this case the dress code is there for safety reasons and I wholeheartedly agree with it. I understand she doesnt like dress codes, who does, but in this specific case that's a hill She can literally die on if she doesnt come to her senses.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rebel against a rule that says you cannot show your ankles in a classroom. It is quite another to flaunt a rule that is put in place for purely safety reasons. Your daughter needs to learn the difference, and she is acting an AH - and so is anyone supporting her stance here.", "NTA so those rules are for safety. I would feel different if it's about policing a girls body etc. but this is a safety concern.", "NTA and my only consolation is that statistically speaking, she'll grow out of this at some point. Thank you for not making life difficult for those camp counselors.\n\nThe thing about these particular rules is that they're not being imposed on her by the patriarchy or whatever to stifle her self-expression -- they are literally there for her comfort and more importantly, her safety. Rock climbing is a risky and challenging sport even when all the safeguards are in place and wearing clothing that can catch on equipment can endanger you and the ones spotting you. I have no idea what your husband is thinking, but I'm going to assume that as a full adult human who has so far kept his 15 year-old alive and safe, he'll want to continue to do so even if it means she doesn't get to wear a dress in a canoe.", "NTA, this should be obvious. Your daughter was a liability to the camp rock climbing in a dress. Standing up for her would have made you the asshole.", "NTA.

It\u2019s possible she was intentionally dressing in a way that wouldn\u2019t let her do the activity.", "NTA The camp dress code seems reasonable and it's based on the safety of the campers. It's not something silly like a 1/4 an inch on the length of a dress.", "NTA. Hope this is a lesson for your daughter to learn that she can't always get her ways.", "NTA.  She knows the rules.  These rules are clearly purely safety and applicable to every person.  She chooses to intentionally disregard.  She knows there will be consequences.  It\u2019s time she learns.", "NTA\n\nI am however concerned about the priorities your daughter (and perhaps your husband) seems to have. How is it difficult to understand that prettying herself is one thing, safety is another.", "We have dress codes against common sense (like the hijab in Iran, or overtly exposing/uncomfortable sports wear for girls)\n\nThen we have dress codes based on culture and/or tradition (referee in box, dress code in holy sites)\n\nAnd then there are dress codes based on reason. Your case is the last one. They are enforcing workout cloth because it has a smaller chance of getting stuck somewhere or causing harm. \n\nAlso your daughter should learn to respect the law. As much as she should learn to cherish personal/individual freedom. \n\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA.  The rules are for safety.", "NTA. Dress codes at camp are for practical and safety reasons. Not to mention that they have the right to enforce whatever attire rules they want so long as they are enforced equally among all campers. If they let your daughter wear a dress they would have to let all other campers wear what they want, and that could end horribly. Your daughter is at an age where she wants to rebel simply for the sake of being a rebel, and she has to learn there are rules and policies in any society that need to be followed.", "NTA.  The clothing restrictions are for both safety and avoid distractions.  I would just pull her out if she cannot follow basic rules.", "NTA\n\n\u201cHealth and Safety\u201d trumps fashion. \n\nYou can\u2019t rock climb in a skirt. \n\nOk, you MIGHT be able to kayak in a skirt, but you can\u2019t swim in a skirt if you capsize - and capsizing training is part of kayaking (I (f) did kayaking as a teenager and still do it as an over 60yo woman).\n\nI appreciate that she wants to dress fashionably, but there are fashionable work-out clothes which I am sure she would happily wear to the gym.", "So they want you to fight for her to wear a dress climbing? Do they hear themselves. Yes, please wear a gown with all the ropes and gear cause that is a smart idea", "Their excuse is silly, it's like saying wearing a helmet on a motorcycle is a dress code that should be ignored in favour of fashion.\n\nNTA \n\nNot sure what your husbands problem is but your daughters behaviour might change if he grows up and has your back too.", "NTA. But invite them to do indoor rock climb and make your daughter wear her dress and husband wear a suit, and tell them that if they can complete the task you will insist to the camp that your daughter can handle herself. \n\nGosh I can understand if your kid (even if she\u2019s 15 already) does not understand consequences of her actions, but the husband to defend her? Gosh. How does she think the gears to attach to her if she\u2019s wearing an open bottom clothes? Don\u2019t tell me she even plans to wear heels? Lol", "NTA. This is a safety concern. She could get seriously hurt if her dress impedes with her equipment.\n\nIf your daughter doesn\u2019t want to wear appropriate attire she can\u2019t participate. \n\nWhile a fifth-teen year olds may have trouble with that concept I\u2019m amazed your husband doesn\u2019t understand that.", "Nta and wtf is ur daughter (no offense) dumb or smthn I'm litteraly a year older than her and I have atleast some common sense (I'm also dumb but not that dumb)", "NTA. What do they want you to say? That rules and dress code don't apply to your daughter unless she wants them to? Why stop there?

Not your problem.", "NTA\n\nThese aren\u2019t dress codes to impose any \u201cmorality\u201d or \u201cmodesty\u201d, but simply safety for the area & activities. \n\nCould it be she just doesn\u2019t like being at camp and the activities there? This kinda feels like \u201coh no. Forgot my gym clothes. Guess I can\u2019t participate\u201d (which I did regularly in high school to get out of gym - side note, yes they make you go to summer school if you fail gym for not participating). She might enjoy something else. Is there a theatre camp or art program she might enjoy more? Somewhere she can dress up & express herself.", "INFO: Did she actually want to go to this camp?", "NTA. I also like to dress up/overdress on occasion. I wear a lot of dresses. Some have petticoats. The absolute dressiest I would get for sports is like, wearing a romper on a walk or a hike.

If this was a fight about the width of her tank top strap or a unreasonable expectation for the length of her shorts i would roast you for not fighting at the top of your lungs, but this is safety.   Climbing in a dress is dangerous.

Or is it also an issue for you anytime she gets dress coded?", "NTA but why aren't you disciplining her for not following the rules. the attitude she has about rules on dressing are outrageous. i could understand if they were being misogynistic about what clothes she can where but they're not they're just asking her to wear appropriate clothes for the situation and because she doesn't want to be told what to do she'll wear something else just to say no one gonna tell me what to do. parent your child", "Yata", "Swear I've read this story before", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s weird looking and sooo uncomfortable. It is hard to explain in women\u2019s clothing as it tends to use waist and hip not rise and often no inch guide only arbitrary sizing.

I also wore what you Americans call suspenders to wear trousers lower but not fall down. We call them braces. I also wore what we call suspenders as in belt and stockings rather than pantyhose.
