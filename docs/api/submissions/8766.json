The bottom line is that OP agreed to 15 days.  Didn't stipulate only local or in-country travel, didn't stipulate on maximum consecutive dates, didn't seem to ask \\*any\\* questions.  Makes me think she wasn't planning on honoring the agreement in the first place, because nobody is \\*that\\*....naive.  Whether the terms are fair and equitable is in the eye of the beholder.  They were fair enough for OP to agree to them without question in the first place.\n\nOP is, most definitely, TA", "No, I get that. But if that was all it was then the youngest could just stay at home with Mom. Why does he so desperately want her to go with him?", "Most breastfeeding mothers I know pump and bottle. I don't see why OP couldn't do that for an overnight stay. That's not to say the kid won't be fussy about a rubber nipple versus a real one, but it's quite possible for breastfeeding mothers to be away from their kid overnight.", "I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not her is that he wants. It\u2019s that he wants all the children to come and she\u2019s needed for the youngest to come.", "But she should never have been in this position. \n\nIf he was a decent dad and co-parent he would have said yes to 5 days and asked for 5 days back at some point. \n\nShe\u2019s not an AH because her ex is trash. I agree she is shortsighted for saying yes. But we have no idea the circumstances that led her to believe this was her only option.", "I'm not sure about the ins and out of her breastfeeding situation with her little one, but I figured that was a reasonable assumption that she's breastfeeding. Not saying it's a definite. Baby could also just be especially fussy being away from her on overnights, or she's intentionally leaving out details. I just didn't want to assume the latter", "If you read the post OP says their ex never said they'd be using their days to go on a 15 day long trip. So no, OP didn't just agree to this because she \"*really* wanted that vacation\" she agreed to it when she thought it meant he'd take them extra days during the week.", "I see, thanks", ">But she should never have been in this position.\n\nAbsolutely right, but she is in this position and her choices still matter even if she bears no fault for the situation she's in.", "A dead parent is different. There\u2019s no custody arrangements with dead parents. And since people have been stopped, apparently they can stop you to ask!", "Customs officers can\u2019t legally stop you\u2026.\n\nTell me you have never travelled across a border without telling me you haven\u2019t travelled across a border\u2026.", "No he can\u2019t. There is no contract. \n\nI doubt he\u2019s going to be getting better custody rights when she goes to a judge and says \u2018my other half denied me a perfectly reasonable holiday request unless I promised to give him an unreasonable amount of time back and now is using it to try and force me to go away with him\u2019. \n\nYou see, in most sane countries, judges don\u2019t like parents who put their desire to manipulate their ex above their child\u2019s needs and best interests.", "Sure they matter. \n\nThey don\u2019t make her responsible for this mess or an AH though. And they don\u2019t make her undeserving of sympathy.", "I know a woman who was taken away from her boyfriend at JFK and interviewed for hours (him having no idea what was going on) because she spoke English very well so they wouldn\u2019t believe she was Italian.", "I don't think she's responsible for the entire mess and completely agree that she deserves some empathy. It's absolutely unfair that she's having to deal with this situation and that she has to figure out how to raise her kids with this dude.\n\nThat said, she didn't make a great choice in this scenario and I think in order to thrive she's going to have to learn how to navigate this dynamic with a little more savvy.", "I agree. But you\u2019re not an AH for being unsavvy. \n\nIn contrast her ex is a borderline unfit parent. I really question his fitness to care for kids when he thinks exposing them to a clearly troubled relationship for two weeks in a foreign country is a good idea.\n\nI also question the fitness of a parent who sees a reasonable holiday request as an opportunity to deny the request and try and manipulate his ex into unreasonable conditions rather than an opportunity to consider his kids best interests."]}
