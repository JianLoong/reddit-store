Especially if you are still breastfeeding. Additionally, the plane trip there would be frustrating and possibly painful for his/her ears.

You and the baby stay home. \n\nI don't even care what agreement you made. Stay home. If he pushes, lawyer up.

This whole thing is messy. ESH", "You considered them fair enough to voluntarily agree to them. Yes, he had you over a barrel, but that's extremely common in negotiations. It doesn't warrant one party to renege on the deal especially after they've received their compensation. If I sell my car for cash at below market value to cover this month's mortgage, I can't expect to get my car back (and keep the cash) once my financial situation improves, but somehow you do in this situation. \n\nDon't enter into agreements without fully considering what you're agreeing to. You agreed to it knowing full well the condition including that he could \"do whatever he wanted with them even if that meant I had to be there too.\" You claim you assumed that whatever he wanted to do included only overnight stays (which would require your presence why?), but that's solely on you (and frankly, it strains credulity). The time to clarify that was before you agreed to the terms. Words have meanings. Myopia has consequences. Consider this a painful lesson learned.", "YTA. Yes, but you agreed. Do you honestly think that if you do not keep your end of the bargain now that he will agree to let you take the children out of the country again in the future or agree to anything else you want?\n\nHe took you at your word and you need to keep it. I understand that you are breastfeeding, but you can pump, freeze and give him the milk to take if you don't want to go on the trip with him.\n\nIf he took the kids to stay with him for 15 days in a row at home you would have had to give him the milk anyway.\n\nYou are going to have to co-parent with him for years to come, they are his children too and if you can take them out the country he should be able to do so as well.", "They are no strangers they have children together and coparenting is part of adulting.

They won't remember it anyway, because, you know, they're a baby.", "Yes, that\u2019s how that works when you sneakily use someone\u2019s desperation to force them to go on vacation with you. Surprise! You can\u2019t actually do that. BOTH parents agree the youngest can\u2019t be away from mom that long. He knowingly made this deal with the intent to manipulate her into travelling with him. And it backfired. Stay mad about it.", "Yes, both parents have to agree, which is what they were saying. Legally, the kid cannot go abroad without both parents in agreement.

Cruise lines are notoriously bad at checking for parental agreement and the ex simply thought they didn\u2019t need it since they had the passport. My friend sent the kid with written permission anyways since the kid really wanted to go, which the ex tried to leave at home, but the kid didn\u2019t want to miss the cruise and insisted on bringing it, just in case. \n\nWell, they actually checked for permission and since my friend had gone to a notary and sent it with the kid, there was no hang up. Sometimes they\u2019ll just call the other parent and that should be enough too, but you do need the other parents permission. They just might not check it at security like they are supposed to do.", "Ah, fortunately you\u2019ve not had much experience with the spectrum of personality disorders which are a guarantee for high conflict divorce or custody issues.\n\nJust the fact that her ex is trying to coerce her to come instead of having the viewpoint of what is best for the kids shows why OP is not with him and she should consult with an attorney well versed in high conflict arbitration and family law.", "But he also isn\u2019t willing to wait until the child is a little older.", "It\u2019s not the OP won\u2019t let him, it\u2019s that the youngest cannot travel without OP because the youngest is a breastfeeding baby.", "Because she was forced to agree to it if she wanted her kids to see her family.", "She has to feed the youngest. Both parents agree the youngest shouldn\u2019t be away from the mom for 15 days. She\u2019s not saying the dad can\u2019t take them on a trip, but a 15 day trip is a long time. I also don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to go on a two week trip with her ex. He also absolutely took advantage of her by wanting 3 days for every 1 day she took them. I\u2019m sure she agreed because that was the only way for her to take her kids to see her family.", "It isn\u2019t just limited to cruise lines.
