That\u2019s a hard one\u2026Throw an \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was an asshole BBQ\u201d and gear  it towards the kids. Get a bounce house and toys for them. What would cost more, this or your dignity every time you look at your neighbors.", "I can understand wanting to participate but maybe next year you can team up with some of the younger kids (3-4) who may struggle to keep up with the big kids and help them find eggs instead of hunting and taking the eggs alone. That way you still get to participate but without causing bad rep-or with your neighbors", "YTA - you're 25 years old", "I\u2019m confused. Usually where I\u2019m from if adults sign up to volunteer for an Easter hunt it doesn\u2019t mean we do the egg hunting, it means we do the facilitating. So I\u2019m just confused about how this even came about wher you were hinting for eggs? But aside from that, yeah it\u2019s usually just polite to let the kids get the eggs and you kind of just make it more fun for them if you are the adult. You can ati have fun and be silly but the idea is that you do it to make it more fun for the kids not for yourself.", "NTA. u where just trying to have some harmless fun", "YTA - Have you ever seen elf? No way you would fit in", "YTA, these things are for kids.  Your partner could have hidden eggs at your home.  You didn\u2019t have to take them from kids. And there are stores that same Easter candy so you can buy the chocolate bunny and the jelly beans yourself.\n\nSince you as an adult like an egg hunt, maybe have an adult one next year.", "\u201cSo I (f38) really, really love Halloween and I really love Halloween candy, so I registered for our towns trick or treat event even though the cut off age was 10 because you know I JUST love it so much and deserve to go trick or treating. So I went with my partner and took 90% of the candy because these dang wimpy kids couldn\u2019t keep up with me. For SOME reason the parents and volunteers were mad about it so I handed out one piece of candy to like 10 toddlers because otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be enough left for me. I mean, I know Halloween candy goes on sale the day after and as a grown ass woman I could drive to the dang store but it\u2019s just such an inconvenience. Now parents and townspeople are being weird with me. So AITA or is it the demon toddlers who wanted to steal what was rightfully mine?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re really that oblivious, I\u2019m really happy for you. If you\u2019re a normal, breathing human, YTA. And that\u2019s what you sound like in this post.", "YTA\n\nI don't really think there is a way to fix it now. \n\nI've never participated in a public/neighbourhood easter egg hunt like this, they're not really common in my country but in my family we will hide eggs (these are like cardboard/pasteboard eggs that you can take apart and put sweets inside) around the garden and then everyone (kids and adults) go out looking. All eggs are labelled with a name so people don't just take everyone they can find. \n\nBut someone would say \"Ready, set go!\" and we would all run off to go looking for our eggs. My grandfather would also run out with the kids and fake-look for the eggs and go \"Have you found anything? Go go go! Keep looking!\" and just be playing around with us because he really enjoyed how much fun we were having with it. In reality he didn't really like sweets and so he wasn't even trying to find any eggs. \n\nYou just moved to the neighbourhood. Sure, there were no rules about adults being in the easter egg hunt but once you saw that only kids were involved you could have just made a game of it with the kids, had fun with the hunt and maybe taken one egg or something but let the kids beat you to the others. Instead you decided to compete with children to take all the eggs you could. And then it wasn't until you were getting comments from parents and your partner telling you to do it that you gave some of the eggs away, and then still kept some so you wouldn't be all out of eggs yourself. You're an adult. You can buy your own sweets.", "YTA. Seriously you're 25. Id be baking or buying something for every single one of those families and seriously sucking up", "YTA\n\nBuy candy like the rest of us. Or, have your.oartner hide eggs around your yard for you to find. But what you did is so needlessly cruel and ridiculous you might be a roald dahl adult.", "YTA\n\nI also want to point out that she couldn\u2019t give an egg to each of the 70 children because \u201cbasically\u201d she would be out. Does that mean she collected somewhere close to 70 eggs? Even if it was half of that, that would still be an absolutely outrageous number. In my experience with these neighborhood and school events, they plan for about 12 eggs per kid. The greed here is insane.", "I don\u2019t think she did get permission\u2026 I think the person who okayed her also signing up for the hunt believed they were okaying her also volunteering with that activity.", ">Usually when people volunteer for a community event, they're volunteering to help staff the event, not \"volunteering\" to get free chocolate.\n\nUsually you do actually get free stuff as a volunteer, just not the way OP did. You get leftovers or a bit is kept on the side for volunteers and shared after the event. Or is this area/country/culture dependent?", "I was wondering if this was a fake stardew valley post as well. Lmao so awkward", "Not only did the OP crack me up, but this comment has me in shambles \ud83d\ude2d", "This might be it, they thought she would take a few and be among the last so kids get extra kick for beating \"someone big\". It's silly, but it could pass under cute silly", "Some arrested development shit.  I would have dumped this lady this sort of cringe you can't recover from", "My mum hides more difficult, higher ones for the teenagers and easier, lower ones for the younger kids and tells the teens to ignore the easy ones. Everyone has fun.", "Eggcitement*", "That's because OP IS Abigail", "Yeah I might try to be generous and assume she is intellectually disabled but uhhhh yeah I would hold a grudge for years once it was clear she was a normally functioning adult.", "I think they were probably too shocked and horrified to move. Kinda like, \"Is she really...? Oh my god, she is...\" And then they all stand mortified wondering who's gonna have to tell her.", "TyOTl", "I'll bet half the kids there had ADHD and still realized that she was behaving bizarrely.", "The hunt is the fun part right?", "Straight out of Stardew Valley", "Exactly, the parents put in the effort to organise this to create some joy for the little kids, not so that some adult can grab all the chocolate they paid for for themself. Oof.", "AuDHD here, too. I'm so worried about doing the right thing,  I am always checking to see what is going on around me in new situations so I don't screw up.", "By far. I\u2019d do an egg hunt as an adult. But not one made for children. Those are almost entirely \u201clook, an egg in the grass\u201d. Where\u2019s the fun?", "THANK YOU!  I was hoping someone would say that!  I envisioned her being all competitive the way my husband and I are with the SV egg hunt every year  \ud83d\ude02", "One year our parents made a scavenger hunt for my brother, cousins and me. They gave us a clue (actually, they wrote the clue on a piece of paper that they tied to the dogs collar and waited for one of us to notice that he was walking around with something on his neck), which lead us to some location in the house/garden, there was another clue, and so on until we found a giant plastic easter egg filled with sweets!"]}
