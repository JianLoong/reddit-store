We came  across a picture of an ex of mine. She got upset as to why I still have pictures of her. I tried to explain that out of the 4,000+ pictures I have, I honestly forgot about it and that I\u2019m not the type of person to delete old pictures of people I knew/dated just because we went out separate ways. Regardless, I deleted the pictures because I didn\u2019t want to further upset my girlfriend. In the midst of us talking about old pictures, I asked her, \u201cSo do you mean to tell me that you have no pictures of any of your exes?\u201d To which she proudly said no and dared me to find any pictures in her phone. So I took her phone and browsed through the older pictures very briefly, seeing nothing. But I did see that she had some Hidden pictures in an album. So I went there (I knew her passcode) and saw mostly nudes, which I figured they would be there, but I did happen to come across a couple of videos of her having sex with another man. Mind you, these videos were 2 years before her and I were ever talking. Stunned, I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I left it alone as if I found nothing at all. \n\nSo fast forward to yesterday and we had a huge argument and I brought up the fact that I had found those videos and asked if she still had them in her phone and why she kept them. She admitted that she was aware that those videos were still present in her phone. She refused to answer, only saying that I had no right to go through her Hidden Pictures. AITA for going through her hidden pictures, despite the fact that she challenged me to find any pictures of any exes?\n\nEdit: I feel I should also mention that she had some private pictures of her female friend in the Hidden album as well. At first glance, I just assumed they were pictures of herself, not really questioning who took the pictures. I didn\u2019t know it was another woman until she told me. I was only looking for males.

She gave you permission, even dared you, to go through her photos. If she didn't want you going through her phone, she shouldn't have encouraged you to do so.  So unless she specifically asked you to stay out of certain folders as they contained nudes of her female friend, you did nothing wrong here. My guess is that she totally forgot the video was there and just does not want to admit that she is the same as you and forgets that she has old photos or videos and what not because then she is admitting that she was wrong for going off on you for having old photos of an ex. I can't imagine that she knew the video was there and still encouraged you to go through her photos, unless she wanted you to find it for some strange reason. \n\nFor me personally, I think having a few fully clothed pics of an ex in an archive of thousands of old photos is no big deal at all... but a sex video on her phone.... that's pretty extreme. I mean, she can do what she wants, but she has some nerve coming after you for something so innocent when she has something much more scandalous in her own collection.", "You should dump her", "Yes", "NTA!! She challenged YOU fully knowing those videos existed and not to mention got mad when you just had a pic of an ex she had full ok sex videos of an ex", "NTA. Going forward, when someone gets freaked out by evidence that you were in fact living a life before you met them, take it as a red flag.", "YBTA When you make your partnership a matter of one-upmanship, it's going to devolve. She found a picture of your ex, and she decided that her regimen of hiding was foolproof. You called her bluff, and she's mad. \n\nTry this. Have a grown-up discussion (after all, you are in your 30s) after she has cooled down. If you really care about her, genuinely apologize for retaining a picture of your ex. DON'T MAKE AN EXCUSE! Delete it in front of her and give her a chance to delete her more explicit sections of her hidden album. After you have done that, neither of you has pictures that are objectionable to the other, and you have no secrets.\n\nGO FORTH AND SIN NO MORE.", "ESH. I get it she told you to go through her phone, but by doing so you went to the petty level she is at. In a healthy relationship, there wouldnt be an insecurity about pictures if your ex, having to look on each others phones, or her demanding you delete old photos. And then doing the same and digging into things prior to your relationship is immature. Like if you have a secure attachment with who you are with now, none of this needs to be brought up. And it seems like she doesn\u2019t which is problematic and then you stooped to doing the same instead of addressing that. Relationships should be built on trust and shouldn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to delete photos because of someones insecurity.", "NTA. If she hadn't challenged you, you would be the asshole.", "NTA, you accepted her challenge. She\u2019s just mad that she lost", "> I asked her, \u201cSo do you mean to tell me that you have no pictures of any of your exes?\u201d To which she proudly said no and dared me to find any pictures in her phone.\n\n> she refused to answer, only saying that I had no right to go through her Hidden Pictures.\n\nYou had permission, it even says you were \"dared\"... it would defeat the purpose of such \"dare\" if she meant, \"go through, except in the hidden folder\". She essentially revoked her permission weeks after the fact. \n\nNot the asshole there, but probably a bit of an asshole for bringing it up in an argument.", "NTA - \n\nHer: I dare you to go through my phone and find pictures \n\nAlso her: how dare you find those pictures/videos \n\n\ud83d\ude12", "NTA - she was clearly projecting by getting so upset thinking there was something worse because she had something worse.", "NTA not every breakup is a bad one sometimes you just helped eachother grow to the point you've outgrown eachother. Plus she challenged you to find something, and you did.", "Lol at making your partner delete random pictures with an ex from your cloud storage, while having video of them getting actually fucked by an ex on their own. The fucking audacity lol.", "This right here! She lied to his face and didn\u2019t apologize after she was caught.", "Yeah, not *every* breakup is a bad breakup. The two people I dated before my husband I broke it off, and while not that much contact was kept, they weren't messy.\n\nIt seems weird to me *unless* the relationship was messy and the break was probably worse that people would have a few pictures of their exes. \n\nThe root of this post, though, is she *lied* and had *home made porn* that she *kept*. It seems to me that the general consensus of nudes and spicy photos should always get deleted after a breakup.\n\nFor example, if I was that dude and found out my ex still had porn of us, I would be very creeped out and want it deleted.", "Not to mention intimate pictures of her female friends were also saved and hidden in that folder, which is just weiiiiird. My friends have sent me some semi explicit photos to get my opinion on lingerie, and while I'm happy to receive and give my opinion on what looks best, I'm sure as hell not saving those pictures for later. Like I'm struggling to find any reason why you'd save your friends nudes/semi nudes on your phone.", "She literally fucked around and found out.", "Gut punch to OP when he saw it too no doubt", "and videos of all things as well, only a certain type of people takes videos of themselves having sex. Red flag for me.", ">Wow, she is the epitome of a hypocrite.\n\nSo is he lol (unless this is a new relationship less than a year old). Check out u/MrMischief2U's history.", "From the description of that video, it sounds like bull did knock her over.", "Yes. Might have been a better conversation if it didn't start with a fight. OP weaponized the secret instead of just talking about it. Although, I don't have a lot of faith that it would've gone well anyway, since she seems hypocritical and may just have gotten defensive.\n\nAnd for that, NTA.", "Happy Cake Day!", "Happy cake day!!", "She maybe didn't expect OP to look into that hidden album. Either way NTA", "Yep this!\n\nDon't give your partner permission if you're not going to like what they find!", "I actually assumed that the picture of OPs ex vas an ordinary snapshot type of picture, not a nude, since it was mixed in with his other photos on Drive. Girlfriend is jealous of OP having any memento\u2019s of dating before her, but still herself is keeping sexvideos and nudes. Yeah, the double standard is strong with this one\u2026 NTA", "I wouldn\u2019t say similar. The pictures I had were a few candid pictures while we were out to eat. 100% SFW pictures, just with an ex. She had videos of her explicit content.\n\nEdit: 100 percent SFW, not 100 pictures. \ud83d\ude05", "For the most part I agree with you.
