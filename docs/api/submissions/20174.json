We came  across a picture of an ex of mine. She got upset as to why I still have pictures of her. I tried to explain that out of the 4,000+ pictures I have, I honestly forgot about it and that I\u2019m not the type of person to delete old pictures of people I knew/dated just because we went out separate ways. Regardless, I deleted the pictures because I didn\u2019t want to further upset my girlfriend. In the midst of us talking about old pictures, I asked her, \u201cSo do you mean to tell me that you have no pictures of any of your exes?\u201d To which she proudly said no and dared me to find any pictures in her phone. So I took her phone and browsed through the older pictures very briefly, seeing nothing. But I did see that she had some Hidden pictures in an album. So I went there (I knew her passcode) and saw mostly nudes, which I figured they would be there, but I did happen to come across a couple of videos of her having sex with another man. Mind you, these videos were 2 years before her and I were ever talking. Stunned, I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I left it alone as if I found nothing at all. \n\nSo fast forward to yesterday and we had a huge argument and I brought up the fact that I had found those videos and asked if she still had them in her phone and why she kept them. She admitted that she was aware that those videos were still present in her phone. She refused to answer, only saying that I had no right to go through her Hidden Pictures. AITA for going through her hidden pictures, despite the fact that she challenged me to find any pictures of any exes?\n\nEdit: I feel I should also mention that she had some private pictures of her female friend in the Hidden album as well. At first glance, I just assumed they were pictures of herself, not really questioning who took the pictures. I didn\u2019t know it was another woman until she told me. I was only looking for males.

I get it she told you to go through her phone, but by doing so you went to the petty level she is at.

And then doing the same and digging into things prior to your relationship is immature. Like if you have a secure attachment with who you are with now, none of this needs to be brought up.
