She's the SAHM and she's working too; you've just placed her so far under your thumb that she's basically an indentured servant and you very obviously do not see her as your equal. \n\nSo, there are two possible outcomes here. First, she stays married to you long enough to get citizenship and puts up with this BS and then divorces you and takes half (or more) of \"your\" money.  Or, you can sit down as a couple and make a budget for different categories like groceries, household supplies, etc. One of those categories should be equal \"fun money\" for each of you monthly.

If you want her to be a SAHM then you should be splitting your money evenly after joint expenses are paid. If you don't do that then you're treating her like a child that can't handle her own expenses. She's a doctor for crying out loud. I'm pretty sure she can manage her own finances.

How generous of you (sarcasm).", "Why does she need to ask? The money should be equally both of yours.", "You keep using this qualifier \"larger purchase.\" \n\nWhat's a \"larger\" purchase? Because you got your dick all in a knot over make up. Is that a large purchase too? How small does her purchase get to be before it's a \"small\" one?", "Large like a $16 mascara?", "*Their* paycheck just happens to be in his name.", "He\u2019s a doctor. They don\u2019t develop socially the same way due to intense burnout and perpetual schooling. A majority of doctors are wildly immature and have massively overinflated egos because of it. That\u2019s why doctors tend to marry doctors or other workaholics.", "If it is just lunch, and coffee that would be ok. As long as it is not fine dining or something. She buys coffee and pastries outside almost daily.", "Runs the marriage like a prison. I feel sorry for ops spouse..", "She can get licensed here, we had talked about it about 3 years ago but not recently. it just takes some time and passing an exam and possibly redoing a medical residency.", "Exactly, \u201cthere\u2019s no limit\u201d and \u201c$100-200 a month\u201d are so crazy different", "It is more the fact that she tried to hide it and buy it without my knowledge that is problematic. At current levels I am ok with it, but if it turned into an addiction like wearing makeup to go to the store or coffee with a friend daily it would be a problem.", "We are in the US, it is more than that. I have no limit, and it is much more than that if you count food.\n\n$200 is an estimate for stuff that is uniquely for her like makeup, jewelry, dresses, tampons etc.", "$300+ like a phone or expensive diner, expensive kitchen appliance etc is a large purchase.", "So, why is that different from make up?", "Maybe she needs to get out, to socialize, to feel like herself again.  You are controlling and seem to have necessitated the \"lying\".  Loosen up, stop trying to control your wife.", "Do prisoners have to have permission on what they spend their money on in the commissary? I actually don\u2019t know, but I almost feel like they might have more freedom with the money they have.", "Your wife needs her own money, her own credit card to buy what she wants when she wants to.\n\nYour talking about grocery store make up, very sad man you are.\n\nThis is abuse.  She cried because her life is so pathetic that she is getting questioned a about make up purchase.\n\nYou dont get to say no to shoes for her.", "No it wouldn\u2019t? Something that makes your wife feel good about herself isn\u2019t a waste. Is your wife known to have a shopping addiction? Did she previously put you guys in huge debt? If no to both answers then you are being financially abusive.", "Dude, are you serious? Wearing make up to a store is an addiction because it costs money? I suggest you sit down with your wife for some counseling, because if you continue, soon enough she'll figure out how to take USMLE and get into residency, and then she WILL leave you. You can't seriously be THAT much of a miser.", "Wearing makeup daily isn't excessive or problematic for American women. You are controlling what she wears as well as her ability to spend money", "Your wife has the right to wear makeup whenever she wants to. If she decides not to leave the house tomorrow but still wants to wear makeup, that is her right. Wearing makeup is not an addiction.\n\nAnd, YTA.", "Why? Why is that a problem? \n\nSometimes I throw on makeup to go to the store. Or to get a coffee. Or because I am staying home that day but want to feel like I am not just staying home. \n\nYour wife has the right to wear any makeup she chooses without your permission and without the need for your approval.", "Holy crap. It\u2019s very common for women to wear makeup on a daily basis. My mother never left the house without makeup on for several DECADES. Part of that time my mother was a SAHM and my father made less than almost any doctor alive. If he had bullied her over some cheapo drugstore lipstick or whatever, their marriage would have never lasted. Sheesh.", "What is wrong with you?", "You have absolutely no business telling her when, where, and how much makeup she can wear. You need to back right out of that mindset.", "It\u2019s incredibly normal to wear makeup everyday for American women\u2026you are extremely controlling wow. I feel really bad for her.", "You do realize that most women who wear makeup at all wear it daily\u2026", "Maybe you should take a look in the mirror and ask yourself why your wife isn't willing to talk to you about it and felt the need to hide it from you.", "Hold up, wearing makeup to the store equals \u201can addiction\u201d? You\u2019re possibly the dumbest \u201cdoctor\u201d alive if you think wearing makeup on the daily is an addiction.", "Lmao wearing make up daily going out is an addiction? In what world are you living in? Do you really not see why she's hiding it from you? Coz you are a control freak and financially abusing her like many other said", ">It is more the fact that she tried to hide it and buy it without my knowledge that is problematic.\n\nI think we can all agree that the fact she cried about this whole situation is more concerning", "Do you think she is hiding it from you because you seem controlling.  If you want to be critical about what she spends then you need to agree on an equal budget for both of you.  If she wants to buy make up so what until she goes over budget.  House and food for home aren\u2019t part of individual budget.  \nYour trying to say she waste money on stupid shit but it sounds like you want to restrict her on what she buys.", "Oh, I understand your confusion. Allow me to explain: abuse victims often lie to their abusers and you are financially abusing her", "Tampons? Seriously you're monitoring how much she spends on tampons?", "NO. Basic necessities don\u2019t count towards wants. Food, clothing, shelter, utilities, and hygiene supplies NEVER count. So if you have no limit\u2026this is financial abuse. If you don\u2019t want a limit\u2026she doesn\u2019t get a limit.", "You are kidding, right? Either you truly have no idea how much things cost, or you are deliberately doing everything in your power to prevent her from having any independent savings.", "Including tampons as part of her \"fun\" spending confirms you are the AH. Not thinking those are necessities like food speaks volumes.  And you're a doctor! You should know better!", "$200/month barely covers basic hygiene products and decent skincare. Let alone the other things you listed.", "How the fuck she should put all that in 200?\nMenstrual products for the month can be 20 easily.\nDon\u2019t get me start on quality shampoo and skin care.\nJewelry and dresses will not fit", "Tampons are not a luxury you complete misogynistic, controlling, giant dill do of a human", "Look we are all asking about her fun money, not about food. Someone left you a really insightful comment about figuring out where this tightness is coming from. It\u2019s really horrible to think of how trapped she must feel, please lighten up on her and give her more than $100-200 a month to just spend on whatever she wants", "So, you can spend up to $300 on whatever you want, no questions asked and without needing to discuss it with her. Meanwhile, she only gets $100-200 per month and needs to discuss everything with you. You are financially abusing your wife.", "Makeup doesn't cost $300. Why is your dick in a knot?", "But you want to police makeup from the grocery store?", "So, in other words, her purchases have to be about as small and as low quality as your dick before you let her make one without you questioning it.", "So you can spend up to a certain amount with impunity, but she has to run everything she wants by you first?\n\nAnd you justify it because you \u201callow\u201d her to buy (almost) whatever *groceries* she wants? And you seriously don\u2019t get why people are calling this controlling and overbearing?", "Oh hell, you are right. Inmates do get to choose what they want when purchasing commissary. So ops wife indeed has less rights than a prisoner.", "When she was working in London before she moved here she did not save much then and lived a life style of eating out all the time, and spending lots on fashion.", "I think I would support her getting licensed if she wanted to.", "She is Belarusian not American and there they have more of a habit for using makeup for everything.", "Holy shit I can\u2019t even believe this guy", "They arent expensive, of course I do not deny her that. I was giving an estimate in response to the other comment, I do not have a set limit as long as it is reasonable.", "We have not talked about it recently but if she wanted to go through the steps for US licensing I think I would support her.", "I never said it is part of fun, neither are dresses and clothing.\n\nFun is more mobile phones (beyond a basic model), high end kitchen appliances, diner dates etc", "Also you may not have seen, but he includes tampons in her $100-200 a month", "I also feel really sorry for her.", "So she was happily enjoying her live, you sure fixed that", "God she sounded happy", "Yep, and she'll leave you that much faster because your spending habits and your appreciation for her efforts as SAHM leave much to be desired.", "Why do you keep saying \"I think\" I would support her?\n\nYTA.\n\nAs EVERYONE else has said, this is financial abuse. Grow the F-up and treat your wife with some basic decency and kindness. Wtf man, you truly are an asshole.", "Most American women wear makeup daily. It's normal. And you having an issue with that is strange.", "You don't know many American women, do you?", "So let her use make up for everything!\n\nI know you\u2019re bothered by the fact that she hid it from you, but have you considered what it is you do that made her feel she had to hide it? Because a partner shouldn\u2019t be feeling that way, something is wrong.", "So all the more reason for her to buy more makeup then!", "So do American women, do you live under a rock?", "Why are you so weirdly obsessed with her not using makeup? \n\nYTA big time.", "He\u2019s also counting her food!!!", "You're not getting it. You keep saying, \"But I don't deny her.\" But we're saying, \"Why the hell does she even have to ask?!\"\n\nPS: Tampons are NOT cheap!", "And what do you consider reasonable?", "I really had to LOL at this. He is so generous. She is fine purchasing tampons as long as she only spends a reasonable amount on them. Is she only allowed to buy generic brands? My God, this man is pathetic.", "Sir I don\u2019t know what planet you live on but tampons cost more than you apparently think they do. The fact that her \u201cpersonal\u201d money has to be spent on a product that is a NECESSITY speaks volumes. YTA.", "Wow...what a stand up guy.....look everyone he would never deny his wife tampons......in what messed up reality do you reside?", "Dude, support her NOW. She is basically saving you the costs of a live-in nanny, time to give her a \"salary\" corresponding to these costs and let it be her discretionary income.", "How generous of you, that you think you'd support that. And what if you decided not to support it? To you, that would mean she didn't get to do it, right? If you don't see that you are a controlling AH, you're being obtuse in addition to controlling and abusive. Knock that crap off or let her go.", "Seriously? Kitchen appliances is \u2018fun?\u2019\n\nYTA.", "Yay? I'm beginning to see that her purchases need to be as small as his dick before he lets her make one.", "And *clothes* - he wrote \u2018dresses\u2019 as part of what that whopping $200/month covers", "Very much so. She would have a much better life without the prison warden husband. One day, maybe she will wake up and kick him to the side.", "I do appreciate her efforts and I know taking care of a young child is not easy. It is better now but when she was an infant, my wife was extremely busy with her.", "Of course I do, I work in healthcare, born and raised and went to school here.", "They should also be a household cost like toilet paper or tissues."]}
