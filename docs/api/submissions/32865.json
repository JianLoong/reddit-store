He constantly leaves his phone, wallet, hats, jackets, keys, drinks, food and anything else he has in the car regularly by accident and most of the time expects me to bring them to him. Although we are dating I've made it clear that it is still my car and I only want my belongings in it as I am extremely tidy and clean just in general.

As someone with adhd myself I understand accidents happen and I forget alot of things. However, I've spent years practicing habits to keep track of my things and although ive shared my strategies with him, he has not put in the effort to try.\n\nYesterday he left his phone charger in the car and demanded I drive it to his house as he needed it for work. I told him no, I've driven to drop off his belongings before and tonight I had family plans. He's still mad at me but I still don't believe it's my responsibility that he as an adult can't keep track of his things, and I told him if the charger were that essential then he should keep better track of it. \n\nI told him that for the time being my car is off limits to him. This is not permanent but will last until he can show me that he is making an effort to be more mindful and respectful of my property. \n\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: before anyone comments it the goal of this isn't breaking up.

Having ADHD doesn't give someone the right to be an asshole.\n\nHas it been three years of this?", "Set a boundary that you will no longer drive over to his place to return anything. If he leaves something in your car it is up to him to drive over to get it. In addition, if he makes a mess in your car he should be cleaning it or reimbursing you for cleaning. Him forgetting things and making a mess so far have had no consequences for him. If anything, he\u2019s been rewarded by having you cater to his wants. So good on you OP.

Why have you been driving his stuff back to him? That's absurd, what reason does he give for not coming to pick it up himself?\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all, but I'm super curious if something else is going on with him.  Has he had a physical recently?  Becoming increasingly clumsy really isn't a normal thing.", "NTA... this is the way. I'd suggest he does car cleanings or pays for them. Replacing things he breaks....", "NTA. You set boundaries and he ignored them. I have AdHd too and often forget things, but I\u2019ve worked hard on it and developed methods to help. Like you. If he was at least making an effort it would show. An occasional oops happens and should be forgiven, but blatant disregard is another thing. \n\nYou had plans and didn\u2019t owe him extra effort to fix his mistake. I\u2019d recommend he get a back up charger like I did for these situations. Time for him to learn how to adult.", "NTA This is an adult man, right? Not a toddler? Unlike women's clothes, men's clothes have pockets! There is no reason on this green earth for him to leave his keys, wallet or phone in your car.

If you can't trust him to be in your car? What other issues are going to come up?", "NTA.  And stop bringing his forgotten items to him.  You\u2019re not his mother bringing him his forgotten lunch.  TBH, you\u2019ve been enabling his behavior by driving back to drop off his forgotten stuff.  Why does he need to remember?  His GF drops everything to get his property back to him right away.\n\nHe\u2019s an adult, with a car and fully capable of retrieving his property from where he left it.  He\u2019s not going to grow up if you rarely enforce consequences.", "NTA but your relationship is doomed.\n\nSure, you can tell your boyfriend that he's not allowed in our car. Perfectly within your rights. But be aware, this feels like the beginning of a path to him not being your boyfriend any more.

Is it a petrol-electric-hybrid?", "NTA, with a slight leaning towards ESH.  If wants the stuff he leaves in your car and you're unable or unwilling to bring it to him, then he needs to make the effort to go get it himself.  As to why there's a possible ESH, when he exits the car, knowing how he is, you should be making him double check everything *before* pulling away. Yeah, it's a pain in the ass, but eventually he'll hopefully start to be more responsible.", "You might not be an asshole but you would make an awful partner.", "ESH. Banning from the car when you\u2019ve been dating for 3yrs seems like a drastic move.

If so, expectations will need to be managed because I highly doubt his messiness and clumsiness are contained to vehicles (just speaking as a messy adhd\u2019er). People have a hard time changing.

He understands I'm serious about needing him to improve his tidiness.", "Also, it\u2019s a phone charger, you can pick them up cheap just about everywhere including gas stations, convenience stores, etc.  Maybe if he\u2019s being the party that\u2019s inconvenienced he will be more careful and it shouldn\u2019t be OP\u2019s responsibility, he\u2019s a grown man and can act like one.", "He\u2019ll forget he made it and just leave it in your car and just demand you bring it to him.\n\nThe demand is my issue.

I mean, I have adhd and I forget stuff like that all the time (I set it down, wander off to the next distraction, and completely forget where I put the charger).  Because of that I have acquired quite a few USB-A and USB-C chargers, to the point that I never lose one now because thy're just everywehre.", "That's a fair point and alot of the reason I took a more drastic measure. I love him but irresponsibility is honestly a huge turn off", "I've done it as a favor which I mentioned before actually. Also it doesn't matter how many people ask me a question. Since I have already answered I am not interested in explaining it over and over to everyone who asks, even if i didn't answer at all, noone is entitled to an answer there's a way to be polite to people in asking which you definitely should practice.", "Yeah unfortunately that's why I said no more car.

Jesus you need to do some meditation or something.", "Why are you even asking then? Your car, your rules, your property. He\u2019s apparently cool with it, you\u2019re happy with it too. What is there to ask if nobody in the situation has said you\u2019re an asshole?", "Buy him a handbag!", "NTA.  He messes up your car, and expects YOU to sort it out when he's careless with his belongings?  And acts pissed when you don't?  The audacity.  \n\nThis is bothering you (as it should) because he's disrespecting you, your possessions, your standards, and your time.  It does not take a respectful man MULTIPLE \"kind and supportive\" conversations to remember to take out his own rubbish.  And demanding that YOU drop off stuff that he couldn't keep track of himself, even though it's important?  Why is that your problem?  \n\nYou have made exactly the right call.  He got WAY too comfortable helping himself to your car, your gas money and your time.  Point out to him how disrespectful and entitled he's been acting.

Otherwise he can keep driving himself.\n\nDon't back down on this.", "Just know you\u2019re going to be his \u201cmommy\u201d in all things if you stay with him.
