But more importantly, you have the right idea about money. They earned, they should get to enjoy it. I struggle financially, but couldn't imagine going to my parents for help. I know my dad would 100% help me in any way he could, but I'm an adult and it's my responsibility. It sounds like your siblings need to learn that lesson.", "INFO: How much do you make per year that makes you feel so confident that if a parent gets sick or a disaster strikes, that you will be able to cover most of their costs? My mom got sick last year with cancer, with good insurance, didn't even need chemo but her treatment was going to be well over 300K out of pocket. You would be able to cover 300K of out of pocket medical expenses?\n\nIt gives me icky feelings when people discourage their parents from financial planning.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had a similar conversation with my parents regarding future inheritance. I told them that I don\u2019t have any expectations or claim to anything and that they should not limit their goals or life just to try to leave something for us kids. \n\nI would rather see them happy and fulfilled as they\u2019re checking off their bucket lists and know that they passed away happy with no money because they spent it on joy than to see them limiting themselves and stressing on setting everything up just for others to enjoy what they worked so hard for. I would take my parents happiness over money any day. \n\nYour siblings are selfish and are only interested in what they stand to gain. Shame on them for trying to guilt your parents into leaving them money. Good on you for looking out for your parents best interests. Please continue to do so and advocate for them. They deserve happiness in their retirement years.", "NTA for giving your opinion on inheritance and helping siblings with down payments. But please don\u2019t encourage them to \u201cblow their money\u201d completely. You might make good money and can help but a room in assisted living in a regular city in the Midwest is $9000 a month with just basic care. Ltc insurance only pays part of it. If you live in a big city it will be far more and will increase in years to come. Dementia care etc is even more. This does not include any medical expenses. This obviously might be different if you aren\u2019t in the us. It\u2019s fine to tell them you don\u2019t need inheritance but they need to be planning for their future. You might be planning on helping but you never know what can happen in your life that would take from that savings.", "I make more than enough, and I have been planning for my parents care ever since I closed my first deal. So they will be taken care of, and I have already been covering their cost of living since I was 22. I do pay for their LTC insurance, and have accounts setup for them that I have been funding in case of such things. \n\nThey will be fine. I am not telling them to ignore it on a whim.", "NTA.  Bravo OP. Your siblings are the ah's waiting for the parents to die so they could grab their money. \n\nMy parents used to say they were spending it all, to travel and build a small house near the beach. They built the house,  retired there. Then.....Dad got sick & died. Then Mom, 2 years later.  And that money that they saved to take the Alaskan cruise, go to Ireland and Italy and Hawaii never happened. So the 4 of us did get an inheritance. And I hated it.", "Then I don't think that's bad. I worked in hospice and learned early that I never want my parents in a nursing home situation. Good on you for preparing to make sure they are well taken care of!\n\nI don't think you should actively discourage your parents from helping your siblings or other family members though. It can get messy and you do not want anyone accusing you of manipulating them.", "Info: how much support and extra did you receive compared to what your siblings received?", "As someone who actually does care for a parent and covers ALL expenses, I was all set to vote N-T-A because I thought this story was coming from a loving, protective place.\n\nYou definitely have the attitude of someone in sales/real estate culture AND as someone who very much is the baby of the family. Looking out for #1 is a personality trait. I kept reading to see if you would outright say something along the lines of your siblings needing to \u201cpull themselves up by their bootstraps\u201d. \n\nI, too, have a much younger sibling who never experienced the struggles growing up and only knew life when it was cushy and parents had infinite time for them. My sibling has a similar \u201cfuck you, I got mine\u201d attitude. \n\nIt\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re not going to have children because we don\u2019t need to keep traumatizing generations with parents who don\u2019t give a shit about them. \n\nI know many people whose parents left them an inheritance. Others whose parents didn\u2019t care much for them growing up, but took pride in doing the most for their grandkids. Others who brought the adult kids in on estate planning and setting up trusts to ensure there was minimal tax liability if any. It\u2019s not unusual and many people say they dream of leaving an inheritance because they love their family and feel that knowing they have provided for them after they\u2019re gone brings them peace. \n\nI didn\u2019t see anything about the siblings being willingly unemployed or grandparents raising grandkids because the siblings can\u2019t get their life together or anything about them making comments wishing for someone\u2019s death so they can make a quick buck? So I\u2019m having a hard time seeing this as anything other than a hedonist with a superiority complex encouraging his parents to wipe out their security on the hope that you will always be able to provide for them should they run into any issue in this unpredictable life. All so that your siblings don\u2019t dare be able to put a down payment on a house or pay for your nieces/nephews astronomical education costs?

You are all allowed to speak your peace to your parents and at the end of the day, your parents get to decide what they want to do.\n\nAlso I\u2019m curious\u2026 did your parents receive any inheritance from their parents? Or did they build all their wealth themselves? If the former, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s unethical to be the recipient of generational wealth and then spend it all without consideration towards the next generation.", "YTA and wow I normally don\u2019t say that about people who come down on the side of \u201cleave me\nOut of the will\u201d\nSo I\u2019m really eager to hear the other side of the story!\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have children to provide for, so you are likely indifferent to how expensive education is, but telling your parents they should refuse to help their own children, who have children of their own to look out for, simply because YOU don\u2019t need such, is not generous or self sacrificing as you are trying to make it out to be. \n\nIt\u2019s selfish.\n\nAnd this is the reality you live in - I am an eldest child myself, and my younger siblings got college tuition paid for, but also more time devoted to them, sports fees, better clothes, tutors, etc, because my parents were still establishing themselves when I was born, and had me to help cook and clean and raise younger children and nobody else to look out for me.\n\n I\u2019m sure the same or similar is true in your family, but here you\u2019re eager to deny that which doesn\u2019t benefit you directly, and call it altruism.\n\nPainting  your older siblings out to be greedy and duplicitous for having children to consider a future for(the fools!) while you\u2019re rolling in real estate money, thriving off wash trading and a housing market inflated by money laundering and speculative bubbles, THOSE other people sure are greedy, not you though! \n\nThis entire post reeks of disdain.

So while you\u2019re not the asshole in the situation (they are) you kinda sound like an asshole in general.", "Info: is your business based on money loaned by your parents?", "YTA. They want to provide for you. That\u2019s what parents do. You\u2019re being very selfish by not letting them show their love in that way.", "YTA\n\nInheriting after your parents is not a \"shortcut\" to wealth. This is a normal thing to work and leave resources to your children so that they have easier life and could do the same for their children. There is nothing noble in expecting your children to have it as hard as you had.\n\nWith your attitude I sure am glad you do not intend to have children yourself.", "NAH except your sibling for using ableist slurs. \n\nOP is looking out for their parents and their interests. It could be though that OP\u2019s parents genuinely want to use their money to treat/provide for their grandkids. It\u2019s good that they have options. \n\nBUT OP\u2019s siblings aren\u2019t necessarily the evil money grabbers some posts are making them out to be. Kids are expensive. As terrible as it is, lots of families (even those in good well paying jobs), rely on help from the grandparents to fund university/house deposits etc for their kids. If that is what the siblings have been planning their finances around I can see why this change would stress them out. (And no, people shouldn\u2019t plan around grandparents help and inheritance but this is a far from ideal world)", "NTA They need a will and maybe a wellness check up first to establish they are of sound mind. Your siblings could try to contest the will, or put into motion your parents are unable to make these decisions for themselves and the oldest sibling could possibly take them to court and ask for power of attorney. Not saying it will happen, but it could happen. I watched an amazing family fall apart after the patriarch of the family passed. The oldest sibling went to war against the family over the house and property. It\u2019s really sad what \u201cinheritance\u201d does to a family.", "NTA unless your running on generational wealth which would be hard to burn through anyway, your siblings delusions of a big inheritance are likely not coming true. I\u2019ve watched my grandfather save, buy a house, collect a nice pension and in the end it didn\u2019t go to his kids, it went to his medical bills. Medicare and such took care of most costs but they took all his money to make up for it.

They are super proud that they have saved all their life for their kids \u2014 both my BIL and my husband have CXO level jobs & are doing brilliantly. No one needs their money! \nMy own parents are way younger (in their 60s), and we siblings insisted that they don\u2019t leave any inheritance for us.

They already have POA, each have one set so the other is the POA if one is deemed incapacitated, and if the event of both my uncle is listed, and if my uncle unable or unwilling, then it goes down to my aunt, if that falls through then it falls onto me. \n\nMy siblings can try, but they will not get far, and tbh they showed their true colors I really would not lose much sleep if my family implodes in on itself after the passing of our parents. Like what kid gets salty when a parent has the ability to spend their money fulfilling dreams  they have. \n\nI do get where you are coming from, and I appreciate the wise words.", "In theory what our parents have now, could be a great foundation to be the building blocks to generational wealth.  I think that is what they are banking on, my parents do have a savvy accountant that has guided them through to avoid Medicaid / Medicare lookbacks and paybacks.\n\nNot saying I am a fan, but I know that it is extremely common thing to do.\n\nEdit: For example my dad has always wanted a red lamborghini aventador, I told him he has the money for it, not a wise investment by any stretch, I told him go for it. No one can stop you. Pretty much telling my parents to have their mid life crisis now since they never really got one. Right when their oldest hit college age, and the other two were not far behind. BAM I was born. I did force them to put a hold on their plans, and I also was not exactly a easy kid.", "NTA It\u2019s your parents money, they earned it, let them enjoy it.", "Yeah, people really have to look into Medicare.  Those \"free\" Medicare advantage plans sound great, until you get really sick and they only cover 20% of your costs.  Then you could be screwed.", "Good thing a massive recession hasn\u2019t ever happened before, no reason to think real estate might take a tumble", "I\u2019m not going to call you an A because I agree with you. People should do what they want with their money. I just wonder if your siblings would have the same answer to my question. I say this as someone who is 18 years older than my youngest sibling. \nWe had very different childhoods and different expectations placed on us. My sister is only 11 and I the differences are very clear.", "You sound far more measured in this particular response, with some valid points. It\u2019s actually good info to know that they are not struggling. \n\nBuuuuut - if they\u2019re coming to your parents now asking for help with a down payment, they\u2019re likely not swimming in money. Especially not in this economy where the cost of everything has skyrocketed and they have families to provide for whereas you only need to concern yourself with you.\n\nI really think this boils down to a difference in priorities and values. You value enjoying your life (and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all) but you\u2019re kind of snide about your siblings who are more traditional family-oriented. Also nothing wrong with that. \n\nI say all of this as someone who doesn\u2019t have children and likely never will. Because life changed, the parents who thought they were on top of the world and secure had a sudden change in situation, and as the oldest sibling, responsibilities fell on me. So please don\u2019t think I\u2019m coming at you as some parent who is wishing my kids college was funded.\n\nI\u2019m going to leave my judgment as it is because your initial post and other responses reek of a generally selfish mentality and if I heard this story in real life, I wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate the viewpoint when it\u2019s the antithesis of how I feel family cares for one another. At the end of the day, I understand you were giving your opinion and all that matters is what your parents value and decide to do.", "It's interesting you have such an adversarial relationship with your siblings.  They will, statistically outlive your parents, but you seem to not only have no relationship with them, but take pride in that.  I love my siblings with all my heart and feel like I won the lottery with them, including my much younger sibling.  I love my parents too, my dad has passed, but it makes my life so much richer to have deep relationships with my siblings.  I'm curious why they are your adversaries.   And I'm very glad not to be you.", "there's a difference between OP telling his parents to spend their money however they want because he'll cover their bills, and actively persuading them not to help his siblings who aren't as financially successful.\n\nOP's parents are completely entitled to do what they wish with their money. Personally, I think it's kind of irresponsible to bring a new generation into the world with the worst housing market there's ever been, climate disaster on the horizon, recession after recession, and not give them any help finding their feet when it is so insanely hard to get a house these days.", "I think it speaks about your antagonistic relationships with your siblings and he comes off so entitled I\u2019m not surprised. \nAnyway you\u2019re absolutely right. Humans should get to rest in their old age. It\u2019s so sad most can\u2019t afford to.", "One can definitely appreciate that you are encouraging them to live their best life. You did good!", "Why would you want your children to potentially struggle in life? I am only where I am thanks to my mothers extensive efforts to provide for me and help way after reaching 18 year old mark. If I was left to fend for myself until fairly recently I would be left with nothing. I will also eventually receive help to buy my own flat.\n\nIt is obvious I would want to do the same for my children in the future. As for my mother she did not have such help from her family so she wanted her children to have it easier. \n\nThis is the most natural thing I can think of. This is how our society has always worked. Very rich and succesfull people rarely ever come from poor background. While they usually had to work hard to get where they are, they got a jump start from their parents. Likely how their own parents did.\n\nBy the way, the knowledge your children and their children can live happy and financially stable life is in fact enjoying results of your hard work. It does not mean you should live frugaly by any means, but intentionally wasting your money to not have them inherited is just disgusting.", ">In theory what our parents have now, could be a great foundation to be the building blocks to generational wealth\n\nINFO: by not helping your siblings, are the consequences for them petty like not being able to holiday abroad and drive expensive cars, or is this a renting into their forties and unable to pay for college situation?\n\nIf it's the former, I'd say N T A. But if you're literally stopping your parents help your siblings start out their financially stable lives and get a foot on the property ladder, I do think that's kind of a dick move. It might be controversial, but I don't think parental responsibility automatically stops at 18, I think that it's shitty to bring kids into a world like ours and just expect them to thrive in an economy stacked against them in a way that it wasn't for previous generations. \n\nI'm still deciding whether to have kids- it's feeling more and more like a selfish decision with the way the world's going. But if I do, I don't think it's fair to have kids with no intention of passing down some generational wealth so long as I have the means to.", "This is my greatest fear. Way I see it the game should be get as close to zero as possible before you die when it comes to retirement. \n\nReason I also think this way, my mentor great man but crazy workaholic, worked his entire life barely spent his money because he was banking on retirement. Man died from Covid with millions in assets. Sure his family is well off, but he barely got to enjoy his money. I do not want that for my parents or anyone I know. You get one life, live in the moment. \n\nKnow it might be weird but getting an inheritance is weird to me.", "You sound very measured in this particular response.", "Even in a massive recession the the markets did not crumble to a point of zero. Like we would have to get to a point where the markets crash to a point where land itself has zero value, their LTC insurance provider goes bankrupt. \n\nI can handle a tumble, most people with proper investments can handle a tumble.", "Talk like someone who has no property to worry about, and is jealous.", "Why can't you write better replies? Presumptuous, boring sarcasm is the worst kind of sarcasm.", "I get what you are saying, overall I was raised more like an only child. My siblings are only a year or so apart from one another. So they spent more time sharing and stuff like that. \n\nIn terms of overall support each of us had the same, we each received the same amount in our college funds, even though by the time my parents had me they were making much more, and could have saved more, they made it clear to not give one more than the other.\n\nThey offered to help with loans if need be for school, while they would not pay 100% they offered to pay half. They did try to keep up with the same standards and expectations, but as you know older you get the harder it is to keep up . Yes, my siblings had more watchful eye parents, and by the time I got to high school our parents were simply exhausted, and I did get away with more in that regard. Had less to do with them, and more so me being a brat in HS.\n\nI get what you are saying, and yeah I am sure if you asked them they 100% would have a far different view.", ">I really think this boils down to a difference in priorities and values. You value enjoying your life (and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all) but you\u2019re kind of snide about your siblings who are more traditional family-oriented\n\nYeah I agree with this. It's lovely what OP wants to do for his parents.\n\nBut, idk...I can't really fault his siblings for asking for help from their parents either? Maybe this is an entitled attitude but for your average young person, it is almost impossible to get on the housing ladder these days without some financial assistance from your parents. I get that the parents aren't obligated, and they should do whatever they want with their money. But if I had young adult kids trying to start their lives and families in the toughest housing market there's ever been, I can't imagine giving them no help whatsoever.\n\nI do feel like if you're bringing kids into the world nowadays there is at least some responsibility to help the next generation find their feet rather than wash your hands of them the moment they turn 18. Most people don't have the financial situation OP does and can't bootstrap themselves.", "As I said I disagree with your view. I much rather have my parents enjoy their twilight years together doing all the things they wanted to do but could not because they had children. \n\nThey worked hard, provided for us and now it is time for them to start checking off life long dreams. We are fine now without their money, we will be fine later. They gave us everything we need to survive and thrive in this world, it is time for them to thrive and enjoy their life. \n\nLOL but as you said doesn't that sound like a shortcut to you?", "This is my best friend and her husband. He worked like a dog. Wanted to have enough to retire early and enjoy traveling. He's a physician, she's a nurse. Kids were grown and out of the house.  Was 6 weeks away from retirement, fell in the bathroom, broke his neck, and is now a quadriplegic. She takes care of him full time. Now have all that money in the bank and can't travel. So sad.", "My parents are 78 & 80 years old. They have been preparing so much for when the inevitable happens. I am talking about their wills, but also a \"living will & testament\" so we daughters can get stuff done should they become addled enough that they can no longer make decisions. And funeral/burial stuff is also taken care of for as much as is possible in advance.\n\nThey will go for a 3 week vacation to Tenerife next February finally again. They did that for a couple of years, but have stopped when an uncle of mine died while they were there, they had to come back early. I have so often told them that they should enjoy their life! Spend what they want, because they have earned it! Don't try to save stuff for us, just go out and enjoy yourselves!\n\nThey do now feel that the car they drive now will be their last one. Very understandable. They also have stopped camping (in a tent) since last year. Also, very smart, because not sleeping in a bed is bad for my mom's joints.\n\nI do not care about money. Would it be nice and helpful in my life? Sure. But it will not bring them back and it will not make me miss them any less if they are gone... We are just lucky to not have to keep medical bills in mind...\n\nI really hope you can enjoy your parents a lot more, and you are correct that your parents are not the ones responsible for setting up college funds for their grandkids. If the parents can't do that, maybe they shouldn't have had (so many) kids.", "You sound like an incredibly selfish person, and advocating for your parents to somehow emulate your twisted lifestyle is, itself, your way of fucking over your siblings, intentionally.  You sound super spoiled, not in the sense that you were coddled, but that you were allowed to grow up without a conscience or sense of responsibility.", "College is only one part of it. My sister is doing more activities, she has more time with my parents because they work less, she gets more help with homework and yes she has less rules. Sending her to camps and getting her the latest tech is no big drama. My sister is going on holidays every year that we never got. It\u2019s just this whole mix of things.\n\nInheritance is a messy thing at the best of times.", "No it is not shortcut it is the regular cut. Having to achieve everything by yourself is the not the normal difficulty mode, it is the hard mode. This was the case in the past and still is.", "I said I get what you are saying, and yes I also agree I was raised more like an only child after the three of them left the house, raising one child at home verse four is vastly different. \n\nThat said, no matter what our childhoods looked like, our parents did the best they could given the stages they had us. You also correct inheritance is messy best of times, especially when large sums of money are involved. \n\nTBH I do pray my parents use all they can and just choose to put the rest in a foundation or something to help others. As their kids we are doing fine.", "Agree to disagree, you think it is a regular cut, I think it is a short cut. A saying my mentor had, just run through the tape."]}
