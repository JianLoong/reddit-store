But more importantly, you have the right idea about money. They earned, they should get to enjoy it. I struggle financially, but couldn't imagine going to my parents for help. I know my dad would 100% help me in any way he could, but I'm an adult and it's my responsibility. It sounds like your siblings need to learn that lesson.", "INFO: How much do you make per year that makes you feel so confident that if a parent gets sick or a disaster strikes, that you will be able to cover most of their costs? My mom got sick last year with cancer, with good insurance, didn't even need chemo but her treatment was going to be well over 300K out of pocket. You would be able to cover 300K of out of pocket medical expenses?\n\nIt gives me icky feelings when people discourage their parents from financial planning.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had a similar conversation with my parents regarding future inheritance. I told them that I don\u2019t have any expectations or claim to anything and that they should not limit their goals or life just to try to leave something for us kids. \n\nI would rather see them happy and fulfilled as they\u2019re checking off their bucket lists and know that they passed away happy with no money because they spent it on joy than to see them limiting themselves and stressing on setting everything up just for others to enjoy what they worked so hard for. I would take my parents happiness over money any day. \n\nYour siblings are selfish and are only interested in what they stand to gain. Shame on them for trying to guilt your parents into leaving them money. Good on you for looking out for your parents best interests. Please continue to do so and advocate for them. They deserve happiness in their retirement years.", "NTA for giving your opinion on inheritance and helping siblings with down payments. But please don\u2019t encourage them to \u201cblow their money\u201d completely. You might make good money and can help but a room in assisted living in a regular city in the Midwest is $9000 a month with just basic care. Ltc insurance only pays part of it. If you live in a big city it will be far more and will increase in years to come. Dementia care etc is even more. This does not include any medical expenses. This obviously might be different if you aren\u2019t in the us. It\u2019s fine to tell them you don\u2019t need inheritance but they need to be planning for their future. You might be planning on helping but you never know what can happen in your life that would take from that savings.", "I make more than enough, and I have been planning for my parents care ever since I closed my first deal. So they will be taken care of, and I have already been covering their cost of living since I was 22.

Bravo OP. Your siblings are the ah's waiting for the parents to die so they could grab their money. \n\nMy parents used to say they were spending it all, to travel and build a small house near the beach. They built the house,  retired there. Then.....Dad got sick & died. Then Mom, 2 years later.  And that money that they saved to take the Alaskan cruise, go to Ireland and Italy and Hawaii never happened. So the 4 of us did get an inheritance. And I hated it.", "Then I don't think that's bad. I worked in hospice and learned early that I never want my parents in a nursing home situation. Good on you for preparing to make sure they are well taken care of!\n\nI don't think you should actively discourage your parents from helping your siblings or other family members though. It can get messy and you do not want anyone accusing you of manipulating them.", "Info: how much support and extra did you receive compared to what your siblings received?", "As someone who actually does care for a parent and covers ALL expenses, I was all set to vote N-T-A because I thought this story was coming from a loving, protective place.\n\nYou definitely have the attitude of someone in sales/real estate culture AND as someone who very much is the baby of the family. Looking out for #1 is a personality trait. I kept reading to see if you would outright say something along the lines of your siblings needing to \u201cpull themselves up by their bootstraps\u201d. \n\nI, too, have a much younger sibling who never experienced the struggles growing up and only knew life when it was cushy and parents had infinite time for them. My sibling has a similar \u201cfuck you, I got mine\u201d attitude. \n\nIt\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re not going to have children because we don\u2019t need to keep traumatizing generations with parents who don\u2019t give a shit about them. \n\nI know many people whose parents left them an inheritance. Others whose parents didn\u2019t care much for them growing up, but took pride in doing the most for their grandkids. Others who brought the adult kids in on estate planning and setting up trusts to ensure there was minimal tax liability if any. It\u2019s not unusual and many people say they dream of leaving an inheritance because they love their family and feel that knowing they have provided for them after they\u2019re gone brings them peace. \n\nI didn\u2019t see anything about the siblings being willingly unemployed or grandparents raising grandkids because the siblings can\u2019t get their life together or anything about them making comments wishing for someone\u2019s death so they can make a quick buck? So I\u2019m having a hard time seeing this as anything other than a hedonist with a superiority complex encouraging his parents to wipe out their security on the hope that you will always be able to provide for them should they run into any issue in this unpredictable life. All so that your siblings don\u2019t dare be able to put a down payment on a house or pay for your nieces/nephews astronomical education costs?

You are all allowed to speak your peace to your parents and at the end of the day, your parents get to decide what they want to do.\n\nAlso I\u2019m curious\u2026 did your parents receive any inheritance from their parents? Or did they build all their wealth themselves? If the former, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s unethical to be the recipient of generational wealth and then spend it all without consideration towards the next generation.", "YTA and wow I normally don\u2019t say that about people who come down on the side of \u201cleave me\nOut of the will\u201d\nSo I\u2019m really eager to hear the other side of the story!\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have children to provide for, so you are likely indifferent to how expensive education is, but telling your parents they should refuse to help their own children, who have children of their own to look out for, simply because YOU don\u2019t need such, is not generous or self sacrificing as you are trying to make it out to be. \n\nIt\u2019s selfish.\n\nAnd this is the reality you live in - I am an eldest child myself, and my younger siblings got college tuition paid for, but also more time devoted to them, sports fees, better clothes, tutors, etc, because my parents were still establishing themselves when I was born, and had me to help cook and clean and raise younger children and nobody else to look out for me.\n\n I\u2019m sure the same or similar is true in your family, but here you\u2019re eager to deny that which doesn\u2019t benefit you directly, and call it altruism.\n\nPainting  your older siblings out to be greedy and duplicitous for having children to consider a future for(the fools!) while you\u2019re rolling in real estate money, thriving off wash trading and a housing market inflated by money laundering and speculative bubbles, THOSE other people sure are greedy, not you though! \n\nThis entire post reeks of disdain.

So while you\u2019re not the asshole in the situation (they are) you kinda sound like an asshole in general.", "Info: is your business based on money loaned by your parents?", "YTA. They want to provide for you. That\u2019s what parents do. You\u2019re being very selfish by not letting them show their love in that way.", "YTA\n\nInheriting after your parents is not a \"shortcut\" to wealth. This is a normal thing to work and leave resources to your children so that they have easier life and could do the same for their children. There is nothing noble in expecting your children to have it as hard as you had.\n\nWith your attitude I sure am glad you do not intend to have children yourself.", "NAH except your sibling for using ableist slurs. \n\nOP is looking out for their parents and their interests. It could be though that OP\u2019s parents genuinely want to use their money to treat/provide for their grandkids. It\u2019s good that they have options. \n\nBUT OP\u2019s siblings aren\u2019t necessarily the evil money grabbers some posts are making them out to be. Kids are expensive. As terrible as it is, lots of families (even those in good well paying jobs), rely on help from the grandparents to fund university/house deposits etc for their kids. If that is what the siblings have been planning their finances around I can see why this change would stress them out. (And no, people shouldn\u2019t plan around grandparents help and inheritance but this is a far from ideal world)", "NTA They need a will and maybe a wellness check up first to establish they are of sound mind. Your siblings could try to contest the will, or put into motion your parents are unable to make these decisions for themselves and the oldest sibling could possibly take them to court and ask for power of attorney. Not saying it will happen, but it could happen. I watched an amazing family fall apart after the patriarch of the family passed. The oldest sibling went to war against the family over the house and property. It\u2019s really sad what \u201cinheritance\u201d does to a family.", "NTA unless your running on generational wealth which would be hard to burn through anyway, your siblings delusions of a big inheritance are likely not coming true. I\u2019ve watched my grandfather save, buy a house, collect a nice pension and in the end it didn\u2019t go to his kids, it went to his medical bills. Medicare and such took care of most costs but they took all his money to make up for it.

They are super proud that they have saved all their life for their kids \u2014 both my BIL and my husband have CXO level jobs & are doing brilliantly. No one needs their money! \nMy own parents are way younger (in their 60s), and we siblings insisted that they don\u2019t leave any inheritance for us.

There seems to be an undercurrent of spite that comes through, even just heading your side of things", "INFO: are your parents having issues with your siblings, that they come to you all the time for advice? Or was this just a conversation that came up coincidentally? How much are your parent inclined to listen to you, simply because it's you/you seemingly have good argument?\n\nI tend toward N-T-A with tendency to N-A-H. Depending on your answer, though, you might be the A. I understand your siblings issues. Clearly, you are financially better off as they are (that's how it seems) and additionally, they have children to take care of. Children asking parents for help with the down payment for a house or education for the grandchildren seems a fairly normal thing to me, that many (grand)parents would also be glad to do, if they have the money to do so-- even if you're right, that it's of course first and foremost, your siblings duty to take care of. So, I wouldn't generally council my own parents against helping my sibling this way, IF they had the money and will to do so. So, to me it makes a big difference whether your parents were inclined to help your sibling out, but then you talked them out of it, or whether they didn't want to do so from the start, or maybe had concerns and were undecided, and you simply strengthened their resolve/said your own opinion on the matter with no intend to convince them necessarily. You say, your siblings wouldn't do the same for your parents too. And that you told your father, that if they're not willing to help your parents, your parents shouldn't help them either, which however seems kind of preassuming the idea, that they won't help. Of course, I don't know your siblings, but it sounds a bit like a circle argument to me. And at the same time, your post and some of your replies, sound a lot like you're already determined to be the only person to take care of your parents in their old age, and it seems they already have the feeling that you are monopolizing them, just like you seem to think, you have a closer relationship to them.\n\nWhile in general, I think it'S great that you want to help your parents out in their old age, if necessary. And it's also great that you apparently have the financial means to do so. And it's also I think nice for your parents to be able to live their lives happily without worrying for what to leave your children. They should enjoy the time they have left... But the way you do it, sounds kind of odd to me. Even if you ARE able to support them, counseling against them being financially independent of you, is just odd. Also counseling them completely against financially supporting their other children, is off. You just tell your siblings to build their own wealth, but while you seemingly had luck, not everyone can do that, or will have success. Parents with multiple children will know that some of them need more financial support than others, and others again, need more emotional support and so on. For you, who doesn't need financial support, to tell them to not give it to their other kids just seems a bit utopian to me. Especially were it concerns the grandchildren. Like, don't your parents LIKE their grandchildren? If not, then fine. But if so, counseling against putting any money or support to them, just seems counterproductive.\n\nI'm having major troubles trying to understand what you want and where it might lead to. I do think you have good intentions, which is why I tend to N-T-A. But it also  looks like you want them to barrell toward a family situation, in which your parents will be fully dependent on your financial support, because they blew their security nets, your siblings will hate you and have a tense relationship with their parents, and in the worst case scenario this would also affect the grandparent-grandchild situation, as you're also robbing the grandchildren of an additional safety net. all because apparently you have the money, think everybody should be able to make just enough money, and are confident you can handle it.", "YTA for so many reasons...my goodness!", "ESH yea you are wrong, not in telling your parents to live their lives but to telling them not to worry about healthcare or having a plan/will in place.

Your parents know that you promised to provide for them and you are encouraging them to spend beyond their means (that\u2019s what focusing on living in the moment is). Anytime that they make a major purchase, they\u2019re going to ask for your opinion because your parents, realistically, need to rely on your money as a backup. If you don\u2019t approve of a purchase, they\u2019re not going to do it because they\u2019re risking taking money for you. You can insist that they are free to make their own decisions, but your parents are never going to feel secure to do it. If you say no, they\u2019re almost assuredly going to say no as well. After all, any major purchase is money that they will eventually be taking out of your pocket. \n\nYour parents are TAHs because they had to know that this dynamic would arise. They chose to rely on your charity and accept limitations on their spending (even if that isn\u2019t your intent) rather than spend more cautiously and be independent in how they spend their money.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: If someone relayed this post without your thoughts about inheritance, it would sound like you hated your siblings and were trying to get your parents to recklessly spend all of their money so that they would be fully dependent on you and under your control, allowing you to isolate your parents from your siblings. It would sound like someone preparing your parents for years of elder abuse, most likely with a goal of stealing their remaining assets.

If you were encouraging your parents to save so that they could be secure in their retirement, that would be one thing, but you are specifically encouraging your parents to pursue more materialistic pleasures, which you value, rather than family spending, which you do not. \n\nYou\u2019re not a disinterested advocate for your parents\u2019 well-being, and you seem to think that you are.
