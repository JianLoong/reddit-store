They were conflicted because their accountant said they should think about their legacy and children. I told them \"F--k that\" I said they should make it their goal to spend as much of that money they can together while they can still do things. I told them go have fun, do not worry about the future live solely in the moment they have earned it. \n\nI told them not to worry about healthcare costs or anything like that, if it comes down to it I will take care of that cost. I am single, do not plan to have children and do very well for myself. When they told me one of my siblings came to them for a down payment help for a house and asked me if they should help. I was honest and said no, because I know my siblings god forbid our parents needed help I know how they are they will not raise a single finger because their own lives/families are far more important. Which I 100% respect, but like I told my dad if they have that mindset regarding giving help, they should have the same mindset regarding receiving help.

Cause, we also spoke about that, and I suggested don't worry about us and just live their lives and focus on living in the moment, and told them they should have a goal to burn through their money while they still can. My sibling told me I was manipulating them, when I asked how he simply stated that I am encouraging our parents to be irresponsible.

Many do not get that option. \n\nThey brought up things like grandchildren college funds, trying to pull on emotional heart strings of our parents.

They originally had plans to give a large portion to each of us their children/grandchildren spend a small amount on themselves. I understand the mindset behind this, but I told them they should just focus on themselves first and foremost. \n\nI know this makes me come off as an asshole to a degree because it may leave my siblings with nothing and our parents with nothing if they get sick. I can 100% cover their eldercare cost for many years, but I fail to see why our parents should be focused on us their kids in the retirement. They did enough of that while raising us, is it weird or wrong of me to suggest they just go crazy on themselves for once in their lives?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Will they feel peace at the end with the choices they made with your influence? Will you?", "NTA It is wonderful of you that you'd be willing to take care of healthcare costs. But more importantly, you have the right idea about money. They earned, they should get to enjoy it. I struggle financially, but couldn't imagine going to my parents for help. I know my dad would 100% help me in any way he could, but I'm an adult and it's my responsibility. It sounds like your siblings need to learn that lesson.", "INFO: How much do you make per year that makes you feel so confident that if a parent gets sick or a disaster strikes, that you will be able to cover most of their costs? My mom got sick last year with cancer, with good insurance, didn't even need chemo but her treatment was going to be well over 300K out of pocket. You would be able to cover 300K of out of pocket medical expenses?\n\nIt gives me icky feelings when people discourage their parents from financial planning.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had a similar conversation with my parents regarding future inheritance. I told them that I don\u2019t have any expectations or claim to anything and that they should not limit their goals or life just to try to leave something for us kids. \n\nI would rather see them happy and fulfilled as they\u2019re checking off their bucket lists and know that they passed away happy with no money because they spent it on joy than to see them limiting themselves and stressing on setting everything up just for others to enjoy what they worked so hard for. I would take my parents happiness over money any day. \n\nYour siblings are selfish and are only interested in what they stand to gain. Shame on them for trying to guilt your parents into leaving them money. Good on you for looking out for your parents best interests. Please continue to do so and advocate for them. They deserve happiness in their retirement years.", "NTA for giving your opinion on inheritance and helping siblings with down payments. But please don\u2019t encourage them to \u201cblow their money\u201d completely. You might make good money and can help but a room in assisted living in a regular city in the Midwest is $9000 a month with just basic care. Ltc insurance only pays part of it. If you live in a big city it will be far more and will increase in years to come. Dementia care etc is even more. This does not include any medical expenses. This obviously might be different if you aren\u2019t in the us. It\u2019s fine to tell them you don\u2019t need inheritance but they need to be planning for their future. You might be planning on helping but you never know what can happen in your life that would take from that savings.", "I make more than enough, and I have been planning for my parents care ever since I closed my first deal. So they will be taken care of, and I have already been covering their cost of living since I was 22. I do pay for their LTC insurance, and have accounts setup for them that I have been funding in case of such things. \n\nThey will be fine. I am not telling them to ignore it on a whim.", "NTA.  Bravo OP. Your siblings are the ah's waiting for the parents to die so they could grab their money. \n\nMy parents used to say they were spending it all, to travel and build a small house near the beach. They built the house,  retired there. Then.....Dad got sick & died. Then Mom, 2 years later.  And that money that they saved to take the Alaskan cruise, go to Ireland and Italy and Hawaii never happened. So the 4 of us did get an inheritance. And I hated it.", "Then I don't think that's bad. I worked in hospice and learned early that I never want my parents in a nursing home situation. Good on you for preparing to make sure they are well taken care of!\n\nI don't think you should actively discourage your parents from helping your siblings or other family members though. It can get messy and you do not want anyone accusing you of manipulating them."]}
