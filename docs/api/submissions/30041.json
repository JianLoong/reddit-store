A few hundred years ago, it was very common for a merchant sailor to have a \"wife\" in every port, and his wife to have at least one husband on every ship. There are contemporary bawdy songs, cartoons and poems about it. And about how sometimes, if they were disinclined to accept a poly relationship, the sailors settled on whose wife she was this week (or who'd get exclusive rights to live with her in the off-season) with a good ole-fashioned street brawl. Winner retires to the marital bed, loser goes to drown his sorrows in grog and any unclaimed wenches still looking for customers.

There is a CBBC show called Horrible Histories that does an, obviously, kids version and I am always interested in learning the more unsavory side of history because humans have been doing crazy shit like this since we've been humans!", "Lol yea, it is quite different when it is not attainable at all, but I am glad we can see each other's point of view. But man, this spouse is doing this service member dirty and I hate that for him. I mean he could be a dirt bag as well, but as far as we know, he is underway, or forward deployed, however his particular branch calls it and she is just back home being horrid to him. It makes me so mad! This life is not for everyone, but while they are gone, find someone else to do besides other people! Get a hobby, a job or go to college! I got 2 degrees and worked on my Masters until my body said stop that and the VA told me to stop that and here's your 100%  P&T disability check, sit down before you hurt yourself! There are other options besides cheating on your husband. Unhappy? Leave!", "ESH.

If she cannot afford to go then she cannot go.", "YTA. While you are right that you are not compelled to pay for anyone to go on a vacation, there is a tactful, kind way to say this.

Ask her what being family meant when she had an affair.", "NTA. Tell her you won\u2019t fund a cheater & she should get a job. She\u2019s not your kid or your responsibility. Update asap pls", "NTA", "NtA", "NTA.  I would tell those blowing up your phone that you simply refused to pay for her vacation.  That if they want to pay for the vacation of your SIL whom you all believe to have cheated on your brother while he was deployed, then be your guest.

No, you're not. Do you want me to become an addict? I don't know, possibly?", "I'm using that next time a CB bugs me", "I just edited my reply. I understand what you\u2019re saying. I actually have autism, adhd and depression myself. Genetics probably play a part in the efficacy, and some doctors do prescribe it off label for adhd.", "In addition Wellbutrin is a non stimulant medication with limited abuse potential.
