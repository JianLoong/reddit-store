{"id": 25673, "submission_id": "1634006", "title": "AITA for being annoyed that I have to make AND pay for pies for my husband and his friends?", "selftext": "Recently a coworker of my (20sF) husband\u2019s (30sM) lost her house and he said that he wanted to invite her and her kids over for dinner. She said they\u2019re not ready to go out and socialize, so he offered to bring food to them, and she said that would be ok. Knowing how awful their situation is, I offered to make a pie for him to bring as well. I picked the pie I wanted to make and we went to the store to grab the ingredients we didn\u2019t have.\n\nAs soon as we got in, I saw a grocery item that I wanted for our house, so I put it in the basket. He asked if I brought my wallet and I said no, I use my phone to pay for stuff (I assumed he was asking because he wanted to only pay for the stuff for his coworker and that I would pay for the house item that I would also be using). We continued to shop and get ingredients for the pie.\n\nWhen we were done, we went to self checkout and he scanned the items then just stood to the side. Confused, I asked \u201cOh, am I paying?\u201d and he said \u201cYes, that\u2019s why I asked if you had your wallet\u201d. I was a bit annoyed because he got enough for 3 pies (1 for his coworker, 1 for his work, and 1 for the house), all of which I could not eat because I am on a strict diet. I was annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything and paid. \n\nWe got to the car and I asked in a passive (not passive-aggressive) tone \u201cWhat would have happened if I didn\u2019t have the money to pay?\u201d He replied \u201cThen we wouldn\u2019t have got anything. You said you wanted to make her a pie\u201d. (For info, I have been unemployed for 6 MONTHS and only had $90 in my account and my credit card is maxed.) for I left it at that and we went home. Me silently thinking in my head that I thought it was unfair that I used half the money I have left in my account to make AND pay for food that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to eat.\n\nI recently switched meds that can make me irritable so I don\u2019t know if I am just overreacting because of my meds and this isn\u2019t a big deal, or if I actually have a reason to be annoyed. So please let me know. AITA?\n\nUpdate: I pseudo-asked him to pay me back and he got mad and sent me some of the money, but said he still owes me $15 (of course with the most sour tone he could do). I knew this was going to get bigger if I gave my opinion so I just said \u201cok\u201d. He tried to continue the argument so I just replied that I wasn\u2019t going to start an argument. He sat there fuming for a while and said he wanted to ask me a question. I said \u201cwill it start an argument?\u201d And of course he said \u201cMaybe.\u201d So I said \u201cYou can ask, but I won\u2019t answer\u201d, he continues to ask angrily \u201cif you knew I was struggling for money, why would you expect me to pay for the pie you offered to make?\u201d. (1. He made a whole meal for her, so I didn\u2019t assume he was hurting for money that bad. 2. When I offered to make the pie, I never said I would pay for the ingredients. 3. The 1 pie I offered to make somehow turned into 3 pies). I knew no matter what I answered with, he was just going to get madder and want to keep arguing so I didn\u2019t reply. \nThe timer eventually went off for the possibility of the pie being done. He checked it and said he didn\u2019t know if it was done. I asked if he knows what a done pie looks like (I gave an example of the crust being lightly brown) he said yes. I said, does it look like a done pie? He said he doesn\u2019t know. I ask, does it look CLOSE to being done? He says \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. I get frustrated because how does someone know what a done pie looks like, but can\u2019t tell if the current pie looks done?. I get frustrated and tell him to not worry about the pie, I\u2019ll monitor them. \nIt\u2019s been 20 minutes and now he\u2019s making food and throwing stuff on the counters and slamming drawers super loud. I\u2019m going to try to finish the pies, then leave to let him cool off and try to ask him about setting up a couples appointment later.\n\nSorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, I\u2019m getting a lot of comments while trying to make 3 pies.", "created_utc": 1693174786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1634006/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_i_have_to_make_and/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Worse, **he's now expecting you to use your non-existent income to subsidize his spending**.\n\nThis is not sustainable. I've heard of marriages where the income disparity is significant, and the couple struggles to work out whether it's fairer to have equal personal spending money, or spending money proportional to the income they bring in.\n\nBut I've never read of a situation where he earns everything, she earns nothing, yet he still expects her to pay for **his** spending choices using money she hasn't got.\n\nTry and step back from this situation for a moment, pretend it's happening to someone else, and tell us if you don't think it's utterly outrageous of him to behave like that. It would be outrageous even if **he** were eating all the pies and nothing was going to the co-worker.\n\nYou need to sit down and calmly discuss this with him, as a matter of urgency. You need to both get on the same page and agree that you're a family unit now rather than two individuals, **that it's not possible for a person who earns zero to pay for anything**, and that the money he earns has to entirely support both of you until you get a job. He must stop asking you to pay for **anything** until you are working again. Once you have a job, and a reasonable income, you can sit down again and work out a fair budget (that won't involve you subsidizing any of his co-workers' meals).\n\nAnd then you either need to devote all your energies to getting a job, or keeping house for him full time with the understanding he will pay for **everything** (including paying off your credit card debt).\n\nFrankly, I don't like that second option, because it means you will continue to be in a financially precarious position, subject to his control. Much better to have your own means of supporting yourself.\n\nIf he won't agree, and tells you things like \"You're only unemployed because you're lazy\" or \"Your lack of income is your problem, not mine\", I think you know what you need to do.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: typo.", "NTA!

I would personally give him the receipt and tell him to reimburse for everything except your own household pie. Even that he could pay half, since, having a job, I assume he can afford it.\n\nAlso, you might want to address this because chances are it will happen again, and not saying anything creates a precedent.\n\nEdit to add some qs for OP: do you have kids? Do you financially contribute to the household? Would he be expecting you to pay because for the last 6 months, you didn't bring in any income in?
