Or else...my asterisk earlier was regarding other bachelor party activities. Was she trying to send Dex to ensure that there were no strippers or drugs involved? Would she really keep a child up half the night to chaperone his dad? Either way, you and your adult mates were entitled to have a child-free evening.", "As a mother of a 10M and 8F I wouldn't let my children go to bachelore party. In my opinion they are in a state where they are interested of everything and I mean everything that an adult person do and they will copy it.

What adult males are doing and what a teenage boy should see these are not always the same.\n Yes, as a father you should take him with you bc you are his role model but please start something more child friendly. \nMaybe your wife just wanted a night off and when you realy want something and dont get it you just flip, even if you are wrong... try talk to her, make plans to take your son out, give her a free night. \nAnd congratulations to the bride and groom.", "NTA, the assumption that you would take a 12 year old to a bachelor party is absolutely insane.
