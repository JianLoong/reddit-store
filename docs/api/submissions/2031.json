Cal wanted to just have a bonfire, smoke cigars, and drink of course. We played music, and we rehashed a lot of old times, and toasted to the marriage.\n\nEarlier this week, my wife asked me what time we planned to be out till. I said probably way too late and best for her not to wait up. But then she said, **\"How could I not wait up when you're taking Dexter?\"** Which totally threw me because I never once mentioned that he was invited.\n\nRose then proceeded to tell me that I was being a huge jerk for not considering how heartbroken Dexter would be when I tell him he was uninvited. Which is not the vase, and I pointed out that the activites Cal wanted weren't child friendly but the only made her more mad.\n\nThe arguing went.nowhere and eventually said to Rosethat's I never promised or invited Dexter to the bachelor party, and I never even talked about it in feont of him. She promised him a fun night with his uncles and me, but didn't even think to check with me?\n\nUnderstandably, Dexter was very upset when he was sat down and Rose explained that the party was not appropriate for him, and then tried to say that Cal was being selfish for not considering him.\n\nThat really irked me, sso i tolf Rose that the bachelor party was to celebrate Cal's wedding, and that kids aren't even supposed to be there in to the first place!\n\nI apologized for not being clear with Dex from the beginning, but I wasn't going to take him along just because he didn't want to be left out. I did tell him that he can be as mad or upset as he wants, but not to be mad at Cal. I then reassured him that he is loved by his uncles and mom and I, and that. He's so excited for the weeding tjat I hope that this didn't spoil it.\n\nRose was rather cold with me the last few days and when I got home around 3AM, I found a note on the bedroom door thst basically guilted me for excluding my son. So here I am typing feom the guest room, barely awake and barely sober, asking AITA?\n\nNo one drove home drunk btw, we had a DD.", "created_utc": 1668159890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys62wx/aita_for_not_bringing_my_12_yearold_son_who_is_a/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who tells a 12 year old they're going to a bachelor party?? \n\nI would never even consider it even if they were invited. Bachelor Parties aren't places for kids. If he had asked to do something fun with his Uncle pre-wedding? That'd be cool. But an expectation he was going and to get his hopes up is crappy.", "NTA\n\nUnless your son was invited by the groom (or is being hired to be there), he should not be there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife however is a massive A-hole.   \nShe told your son he was invited without ever getting an invitation about it.   \nShe hyped up how much fun the kid would have.  \nMaybe even used it as a \"You where never a ring barer, but you will be the first of your friends to go to a bachelor party.\"   \n\n\nIf your son gets upset. Be calm and fair. Tell him that the party was just drinking, smoking and talking about old times.

Does she do thinks like this often? Or did she just want the kid out of the house? Did she think she can dictate how the groom gets to spend his night?", "NTA. A bachelor party with drinking and smoking involved is not a place for children. Maybe you can talk to the groom about setting up a dinner or something that could include your son in the festivities, BESIDES a bachelor party geared towards adults.", "NTA.  A 12 year old has no business drinking and engaging in bachelor party shenanigans.  Your wife may not know how wild they can become; but thankfully,  you remained the parent and said \"no\" to your son's going.", "NTA. \n\nUncle Cal is sweet for even including your son.

Unless otherwise specified, a bachelor party is for adults, not children.", "NTA I don't think you should apologize to your wife for this. Rose needs to realize that *she* messed up here. And she, not you, owed Dexter the apology.\n\nA bachelor party is so obviously an adult-only event that unless an exception were being made and your son were specifically invited it goes without saying that he was not invited. The fact that your wife thought he was and told him about it without even checking is entirely on her.\n\nIt is even worse that she threw Cal under the bus by calling him selfish in front of your son, because of her expectation that Cal... what? Change the entire tone of the Bachelor party into a kid-friendly event just for your son?\n\nRose created Dexter's expectation that he would be going to a traditionally adult-only event inappropriate for children. It is a problem created where one never needed to exist, that she is solely responsible for.", "NTA\n\nyour wife assuming you'll spend the whole bachelor party minding your son with no discussion and then being shitty about it is sucky behaviour. i get she's hurt on behalf of her son but communication would've helped a lot. from both of you tbh, and you could to try to find an alternative for your son (as he was expecting to be able to come)\n\nhe could've come for an initial couple of hours and you could've held off on drinking till then or asked the dd to drop off, or you could spin a special father/brother/son bachelor breakfast event, or like make up a post bachelor party for him to attend and make a fuss of him. it's not necessary, but would probably do some decent damage control.", "NTA. How could anyone think a bachelor party would be appropriate for a 12 year old child?", "NTA\n\nYour wife's position is kind of inexplicable to me.

Trying to guilt you is bad enough, but trying to lay it on the groom - your brother - makes *her* an AH.

Your wife is being ridiculous.", "INFO - since the 12yo is part of the wedding party, why not have had him come for the first hour or when you eat or something and then his mother could bring him home.\n\nThat way he isn\u2019t around for the more adult situation with the drinking and he could still have felt like a real part of the evening.\n\nIdk, seems like a wasted opportunity to have given the kid his first grown up \u201cI\u2019m a man\u201d type experience.

A bunch of grown men want an evening out that involves some drinks, some cigars and some banter.\\* They're entitled to have that without a 12-year-old boy around. And quite frankly none of that is fun for a 12-year-old, and it ruins the vibe. Your wife is in the wrong, not only for not asking you first, but for not understanding that this is unfair to you. Or else...my asterisk earlier was regarding other bachelor party activities. Was she trying to send Dex to ensure that there were no strippers or drugs involved? Would she really keep a child up half the night to chaperone his dad? Either way, you and your adult mates were entitled to have a child-free evening.", "As a mother of a 10M and 8F I wouldn't let my children go to bachelore party. In my opinion they are in a state where they are interested of everything and I mean everything that an adult person do and they will copy it. So I wouldn't start with a bachelore party where the alcohol is a guest. What adult males are doing and what a teenage boy should see these are not always the same.\n Yes, as a father you should take him with you bc you are his role model but please start something more child friendly. \nMaybe your wife just wanted a night off and when you realy want something and dont get it you just flip, even if you are wrong... try talk to her, make plans to take your son out, give her a free night. \nAnd congratulations to the bride and groom.", "NTA, the assumption that you would take a 12 year old to a bachelor party is absolutely insane. Not only is it not an appropriate setting for a young boy, you would have also utterly ruined the event for everyone by bringing him.
