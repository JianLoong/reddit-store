Grace loves The Little Mermaid and she has wanted to dye her hair red since she was about 5. My ex said no, she's too young, and at the time I agreed, and it never came up again.\n\nFor her friends birthday, her and her friends went to see the film when it released. She got really interested in Ariel all over again, and started asking about getting her hair coloured red again. My ex again said no, but I told him that we could let her use temporary hair dye (will wash out in about 10 washes so around 5 weeks), and compromised on the shade of red Ariel wears in the films (that is ginger and not bright red) and he agreed to this.\n\nGrace has very fair platinum blonde hair, inherited from me, while my ex has dark brown hair. The colour in the bottle was called burnt copper (I had shown my ex the bottle beforedyeing Grace's hair), but as Grace's hair is very light, it turned to be more red than copper like it said on the on the packet. I wasn't too worried, as the colour would wash out and look more like the model, and Grace was delighted with her new hair.\n\nMy ex came to pick her up and said Grace looked just like Ariel. While at his for the weekend, my ex got her to wash her hair, and he didn't tell me. I was furious, Grace was meant to use a colour safe shampoo, and her hair was washed just before she got her hair dyed, to maximise the colour of her hair. Her hair is now very faded and dull, and she came home and burst into tears.\n\nMy ex said he didn't know that regular shampoo would cause the colour to come out like that, but when I pressed him, he said he was taking Grace to his boss' barbeque and he thought her hair was too distracting. He blames me for not saying her hair would be so bright, although it turned out like the reference pictures on the packet for platinum blonde. He claims he only looked at the hair colour of the model in front, although her colour is less vibrant as she goes from brown to copper. I told him that is his fault for approving it without checking all the details. Grace told me she told my ex she needed to use special shampoo from me but my ex told her that his shampoo would be the same.\n\nI have redyed Grace's hair from what was left over in the packet as she was so upset and my ex is calling me TA for redying her hair as I didn't get his permission. I don't think I am in the wrong.\n\neta- This type of dye will not damage or alter her hair colour. My ex never washes Grace's hair. She hates the feeling of wet hair and I struggle to get her to wash it. When we split, I took on the responsibility to wash her hair.\n\nI will not be replying to more comments calling me TA for 'pressuring' my ex to let me dye Grace's hair. He is a grown adult and **we both agreed to dye her hair**. It was a little brighter than we both expected, but one wash later it would fade to look like what the package said. He chose to trick her into washing the colour out without bringing his concerns up to me.\n\n**I didn't use box dye on her**. She is 7, and that would damage the colour of her hair, and they have lots of harsh chemicals in them. **It was a colour 'mask' intended for blonde hair** and would fade in 10 washes to her hair colour. By using shampoo not provided in the kit, her hair came out dull and faded. I had done my research with this, and it is from a brand my sister uses, who also has our hair colour and she has been left with no damage to her hair colour.\n\n**I dyed Grace's hair TEMPORARILY, because she wanted it, it was a fun way for her to express herself and it wasn't harming her or anyone else.**", "created_utc": 1688120329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mwgfr/aita_for_dyeing_my_daughters_hair_red_and/", "score": 1074, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Never regretted it.", "You\u00b4re NTA, your ex is the one causing problems here.   \n\n\nHowever, as much as you are NTA, and your ex is, the reality is that she will be between two parents and this is turning into a stand off between two parents, and the one paying the price is your daughter.   \n\n\nIt\u00b4s not always about who is right, and I think this is a situation where it is about who is the most mature (or the wisest). Standing your ground is at the expense of your daughter, and even if you have every right to do so, you might want to de-escalate the situation now.  \n\n\nTrust me, as a kid from divorced parents I can tell you, being between battling parents is terrible for and will mess you up. There will be feelings of guilt, feelings of fear, and overall feelings of resentment. And trust me on this, when your kid will be old enough, they will understand better who was doing the right things for you and who wasn\u00b4t.

But with your daughter telling them they should have checked. It does sound like ulterior motives might have been in play.\n\nI'd honestly say re-dying her hair isn't a big deal since it was already agreed to have it that colour before but I can see a world where others disagree.", "NTA. \n\nHer father prioritized using her as a life prop and betrayed her trust and yours to do it; now he is gaslighting you, making his 'mistake' your responsibility.
