Grace loves The Little Mermaid and she has wanted to dye her hair red since she was about 5. My ex said no, she's too young, and at the time I agreed, and it never came up again.\n\nFor her friends birthday, her and her friends went to see the film when it released. She got really interested in Ariel all over again, and started asking about getting her hair coloured red again. My ex again said no, but I told him that we could let her use temporary hair dye (will wash out in about 10 washes so around 5 weeks), and compromised on the shade of red Ariel wears in the films (that is ginger and not bright red) and he agreed to this.\n\nGrace has very fair platinum blonde hair, inherited from me, while my ex has dark brown hair. The colour in the bottle was called burnt copper (I had shown my ex the bottle beforedyeing Grace's hair), but as Grace's hair is very light, it turned to be more red than copper like it said on the on the packet. I wasn't too worried, as the colour would wash out and look more like the model, and Grace was delighted with her new hair.\n\nMy ex came to pick her up and said Grace looked just like Ariel. While at his for the weekend, my ex got her to wash her hair, and he didn't tell me. I was furious, Grace was meant to use a colour safe shampoo, and her hair was washed just before she got her hair dyed, to maximise the colour of her hair. Her hair is now very faded and dull, and she came home and burst into tears.\n\nMy ex said he didn't know that regular shampoo would cause the colour to come out like that, but when I pressed him, he said he was taking Grace to his boss' barbeque and he thought her hair was too distracting. He blames me for not saying her hair would be so bright, although it turned out like the reference pictures on the packet for platinum blonde. He claims he only looked at the hair colour of the model in front, although her colour is less vibrant as she goes from brown to copper. I told him that is his fault for approving it without checking all the details. Grace told me she told my ex she needed to use special shampoo from me but my ex told her that his shampoo would be the same.\n\nI have redyed Grace's hair from what was left over in the packet as she was so upset and my ex is calling me TA for redying her hair as I didn't get his permission. I don't think I am in the wrong.\n\neta- This type of dye will not damage or alter her hair colour. My ex never washes Grace's hair. She hates the feeling of wet hair and I struggle to get her to wash it. When we split, I took on the responsibility to wash her hair.\n\nI will not be replying to more comments calling me TA for 'pressuring' my ex to let me dye Grace's hair. He is a grown adult and **we both agreed to dye her hair**. It was a little brighter than we both expected, but one wash later it would fade to look like what the package said. **I gave him pictures of the packet and looking back at it, it says clearly to wash with the shampoo in the kit. He had this information. I didn't 'assume' anything.** He chose to trick her into washing the colour out without bringing his concerns up to me.\n\n**I didn't use box dye on her**. She is 7, and that would damage the colour of her hair, and they have lots of harsh chemicals in them. **It was a colour 'mask' intended for blonde hair** and would fade in 10 washes to her hair colour. By using shampoo not provided in the kit, her hair came out dull and faded. **I had done my research with this, and it is from a brand my sister uses, who also has our hair colour and she has been left with no damage to her hair colour.**\n\n**I dyed Grace's hair TEMPORARILY, because she wanted it, it was a fun way for her to express herself and it wasn't harming her or anyone else.**", "created_utc": 1688120329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mwgfr/aita_for_dyeing_my_daughters_hair_red_and/", "score": 4027, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Never regretted it.", "You\u00b4re NTA, your ex is the one causing problems here.   \n\n\nHowever, as much as you are NTA, and your ex is, the reality is that she will be between two parents and this is turning into a stand off between two parents, and the one paying the price is your daughter.   \n\n\nIt\u00b4s not always about who is right, and I think this is a situation where it is about who is the most mature (or the wisest). Standing your ground is at the expense of your daughter, and even if you have every right to do so, you might want to de-escalate the situation now.  \n\n\nTrust me, as a kid from divorced parents I can tell you, being between battling parents is terrible for and will mess you up. There will be feelings of guilt, feelings of fear, and overall feelings of resentment. And trust me on this, when your kid will be old enough, they will understand better who was doing the right things for you and who wasn\u00b4t.

Even in the case of medical proceedures I would assume there only needs to be consent from one parent.\n\nIt's possible her school may have uniform code which prohibits \"unnatural hair colours\" but unless they specify that meaning dyed at all rather than \"not a colour that human hair can be\" they've got nothing.

But with your daughter telling them they should have checked. It does sound like ulterior motives might have been in play.\n\nI'd honestly say re-dying her hair isn't a big deal since it was already agreed to have it that colour before but I can see a world where others disagree.", "NTA. \n\nHer father prioritized using her as a life prop and betrayed her trust and yours to do it; now he is gaslighting you, making his 'mistake' your responsibility.

Could you not have bought a reasonable quality Ariel wig for her? If you had, you'd have avoided all the crying after the hair washing, if that is an issue of it's own.

Most temporary dyes are less-damaging, not non-damaging, though a few are out there claiming to be the latter. What OP used was semi-permanent dye, as it lasts about 6 weeks. A truly temporary dye washes completely out with the first wash. Semi-permanent hair dye usually contains hydrogen peroxide.

Don't agree with them, just trying to articulate what I think he thinks.", "Oh I had forgotten the \u201cdistracting\u201d comment! OP I\u2019m deeply concerned about the clothing fights and body shaming he has coming for you both in a few years.", "You know what\u2019s more distracting than a red headed child? A sulky child on the verge of tears at a BBQ. I bet getting Grace to do anything at that party would\u2019ve been 100 times harder.", "Prolly one.of.thpse alt right assets who hates coloured hair or nose rings", "Just a heads up, I dyed my hair regularly between ages 10 and 15. And my hair texture is all fucked up even though I stopped cold turkey in high school. Wearing these chemicals is never really healthy. Just something to keep in mind of she wants to do it again or whatever. I wish my mom had said no in retrospect.", "Did you give him the packet with the instructions?\n\nDid you mention color safe shampoo? \n\nOr, did he wash his daughters hair because you told him it would fade and he thought that would bring it down to the shade agreed upon?\n\nAnd why the heck did you re-dye it without talking to him?", "I worked at a summer camp where one of the kids got a Mohawk every summer. Shaved at the beginning, by the time school rolled around they cut the long part off and it passed his dress code just fine. I always thought that was fun.", "Years ago I dyed my hair red. Just semi permanent dye over my natural hair. Then after a year or two of growing out my hair (and not dying it again.) I decided to dye my hair green. The hair dresser bleached it and that old red on the grown out portions not only showed up, but would NOT bleach out. They were stained pink!!! We ended up cutting all that length off because if we bleached it any harder it would have fried my hair.", "Apparently our mothers went to the same School of Parenting.  In my case,  my mom majored in \"Control Freak.\"  And got an A+", "Semi permanent and temporary are two vastly different things. This is a temporary colour, not a semi permanent one. She can almost certainly use a couple rounds of clarifying shampoo and it'll come right out. Maybe a purple shampoo a time or two.", "You didn't know hair color would be such a big deal.  Consider that your ex didn't know shampoo would be such a big deal.", "Lol no it was a 4 year old with dyed teal hair and her body was dyed as well. We spent 350 on those newborn photos and family photos. Her hair was dyed teal to match step mom because step mom wants kiddo to be her kid. I can easily explain to my 4 year old that dying hair can be damaging and I by her clip on hair extensions so she can have fun colors. This is coming from a mom that dyes her hair pink and purple. The dyes that they used literally bleached her hair she had fried bleached ends of her hair because it was damaging. A 4 year old does not understand what hair dye does to their hair therefore it is not a decision they can make.", "I mean I used manic panic red on my brown hair back in the beginning of January. Its still there today. Its faded, but red. I dont much care about the mom dying the hair but reds can stick around for much longer than it says and people should know that before they do it.", "I'm a teacher and couldn't imagine ever having a convo like this with a parent. It's just none of my business. Also, she has no power in that department anyway, nor do the complaining parents. They're all stupid. and if some parents came to me complaining about another kid's hair I'd tell them to take a long walk off a short pier. (in teacher language of course)", "If it contains silicone it can put like a coating on the hair strand, and the build up can make removal a bit more difficult. Typically drug store shampoos are not formulated to open the cuticle, which is how color is pushed into the strand. With a permanent or demi permanent color you mix it with a developer (peroxide) and that is what opens the cuticle and pushes the color into the hair. It is closed again when we rinse and follow with a shampoo/condition. So with a child, who isn't getting their hair lightened prior to a semi (no developer with these it is just a surface color) should not be able to be made more permanent with shampoo alone.", "Fascinating, thanks!", "YTA for being a bad co-parent and for refusing to accept that YTA when you asked.", "YTA entirely too much fuss over a 7 year old's hair colour", "You and your ex are both the AH's in this situation.  Fighting over her hair and the poor little girl is caught in the middle", "Some natural red heads think dying your hair red is the same as black face", "ESH, when people get divorced is to prevent this type of stuff but somehow even separated both of you are still acting like a bad marriage with horrible communication and not being supportive of each other\u2019s opinions on raising a child.", "YTA Dyed hair in a woman is a major red flag for men. Your ex understands *exactly* why he doesn't want it. There's something called the showtime effect, if you wear a suit you feel like someone who wears a suit. Dress for success. If you're a girl who dyes her hair a bunch of colors you see commonalities with yourself and certain women. Unfortunately, and you can't convince me otherwise, a lot of girls that dye their hair crazy colors are attention seekers and have emotional issues.\n\nCome for me Redditors.", "you are all the AH's. Who lets a 7 year old color her hair?", "Yes, definitely TA", "YTA, not for the original but for the re di, this is poor copareting", "YTA", "So, you're saying let the father disrespect the daughter's choices to keep the peace? This will only cause more resentment.", "Well, since you asked..\n\nThe girl is 7.\n\nThe intention was to get copper hair, which is a natural color. Google it. OP admitted it came out brighter than expected, but I would not call copper a \"crazy hair color\".\n\nAgain, the girl is 7.", "And has she shared the name of which hair mask despite multiple people asking? Sometimes it\u2019s what we don\u2019t say that matters.", "Sounds like he absolutely did agree on the colour as he even referenced the colour on the box himself, it just didn't turn out that way. And why on god's green earth would you send on a shampoo to a man that has never once in the 7 years of his daughter's life washed her hair???", "spaghetti trap? so instead of a booby trap it's a noodle-y trap? Sorry if I'm being saucy here and that joke was cheesy, I know somebody might parse-ly it that way.", "I'm with the guild, look the other way and take my bribe.", "I did too! But my hair was way too dark so I didn\u2019t get to :( when I was older though, I had bright red hair for so long to make up for lost time lol", "I completely agreed with everything you said until \u201cit\u2019s time to give in now.\u201d Don\u2019t teach kids to give into bullies", "I was obsessed with the little mermaid as a kid and then Kim Possible when I was a little older.  My mom is also naturally a redhead/auburn hair. She let me put red highlights in as a kid and I loved them. \n\nNow as a 27 year old I\u2019ve had dyed red hair for a decade and no one even remembers my natural brown lol", "i was more picturing this trap as a plate of spaghetti laying in the open, and when i go to eat it, a cage falls on me to trap me."]}
