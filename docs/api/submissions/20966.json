Grace loves The Little Mermaid and she has wanted to dye her hair red since she was about 5. My ex said no, she's too young, and at the time I agreed, and it never came up again.\n\nFor her friends birthday, her and her friends went to see the film when it released. She got really interested in Ariel all over again, and started asking about getting her hair coloured red again. My ex again said no, but I told him that we could let her use temporary hair dye (will wash out in about 10 washes so around 5 weeks), and compromised on the shade of red Ariel wears in the films (that is ginger and not bright red) and he agreed to this.\n\nGrace has very fair platinum blonde hair, inherited from me, while my ex has dark brown hair. The colour in the bottle was called burnt copper (I had shown my ex the bottle beforedyeing Grace's hair), but as Grace's hair is very light, it turned to be more red than copper like it said on the on the packet. I wasn't too worried, as the colour would wash out and look more like the model, and Grace was delighted with her new hair.\n\nMy ex came to pick her up and said Grace looked just like Ariel. While at his for the weekend, my ex got her to wash her hair, and he didn't tell me. I was furious, Grace was meant to use a colour safe shampoo, and her hair was washed just before she got her hair dyed, to maximise the colour of her hair. Her hair is now very faded and dull, and she came home and burst into tears.\n\nMy ex said he didn't know that regular shampoo would cause the colour to come out like that, but when I pressed him, he said he was taking Grace to his boss' barbeque and he thought her hair was too distracting. He blames me for not saying her hair would be so bright, although it turned out like the reference pictures on the packet for platinum blonde. He claims he only looked at the hair colour of the model in front, although her colour is less vibrant as she goes from brown to copper. I told him that is his fault for approving it without checking all the details. Grace told me she told my ex she needed to use special shampoo from me but my ex told her that his shampoo would be the same.\n\nI have redyed Grace's hair from what was left over in the packet as she was so upset and my ex is calling me TA for redying her hair as I didn't get his permission. I don't think I am in the wrong.\n\neta- This type of dye will not damage or alter her hair colour.", "created_utc": 1688120329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mwgfr/aita_for_dyeing_my_daughters_hair_red_and/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not clear to me why you and Grace would even need his permission to temporarily dye her hair in the first place, assuming there's no custody agreement concerning that particular issue.\n\nIt's just hair, it will grow/wash out, the most important thing is that she liked it and he shouldn't have ruined it (I think you're right to suspect this was intentional)", "NTA. It's only hair. She wanted it, and loved it.\n\nI literally had the same obsession with Ariel and red hair. I was allowed to get it dyed red from golden blonde when I was 9. Never regretted it.", "You\u00b4re NTA, your ex is the one causing problems here.   \n\n\nHowever, as much as you are NTA, and your ex is, the reality is that she will be between two parents and this is turning into a stand off between two parents, and the one paying the price is your daughter.   \n\n\nIt\u00b4s not always about who is right, and I think this is a situation where it is about who is the most mature (or the wisest). Standing your ground is at the expense of your daughter, and even if you have every right to do so, you might want to de-escalate the situation now.  \n\n\nTrust me, as a kid from divorced parents I can tell you, being between battling parents is terrible for and will mess you up. There will be feelings of guilt, feelings of fear, and overall feelings of resentment. And trust me on this, when your kid will be old enough, they will understand better who was doing the right things for you and who wasn\u00b4t. So even if you need to lose a smaller battle now, the big battle is the one where you are trying to raise her into becoming a healthy adult and you stand a far better chance at winning that one if you sometimes hold back, even when you are right.  \n\n\nSo really, you are not the asshole, but sometimes being the loving parent is more important than that. It\u00b4s time to give in now....", "NTA\n\n> he said he was taking Grace to his boss' barbeque and he thought her hair was too distracting. \n\nToo distracting for whom? Too distracting from what?\n\nIs there any part of the custody agreement which goes into details about dying hair? I'm going to guess \"no\". It's not a medical proceedure... Even in the case of medical proceedures I would assume there only needs to be consent from one parent.\n\nIt's possible her school may have uniform code which prohibits \"unnatural hair colours\" but unless they specify that meaning dyed at all rather than \"not a colour that human hair can be\" they've got nothing. It's also pretty much the school holidays.\n\nHe can be upset and call you an asshole all he likes but he's got nothing.", "NTA\n\nIf they want to co-parent part of that is actually listen to your co-parent. \n\nYou listened to him and eventually got his approval to dye the hair, really good.\n\nI'm confused if your partner is feigning ignorance or not because in fairness to him I did not know colour shampoos were a thing. But with your daughter telling them they should have checked. It does sound like ulterior motives might have been in play.\n\nI'd honestly say re-dying her hair isn't a big deal since it was already agreed to have it that colour before but I can see a world where others disagree.", "NTA. \n\nHer father prioritized using her as a life prop and betrayed her trust and yours to do it; now he is gaslighting you, making his 'mistake' your responsibility. It's not a mistake, it's him choosing to go against a decision he agreed to, without consulting you, and then blaming you for it. Based on the divorce, I bet this isn't the first time he's done this.", "Nta. He agreed to something and then he went back on his word. \n\nAnd is it just me or does it make anyone else a little uncomfortable that he said her hair was too bright ? Will other things potentially become an issue with clothes as she gets older?", "ESH just for disrespecting each other\u2019s wishes and creating *so much drama* over something that actually isn't going to matter in a month's time (or wouldn\u2019t have, if it weren't for the unnecessary drama).", "NTA\n\nYour daughter wants to dye her hair, it's not a big deal, your ex is going to cause serious issues", "ESH if it\u2019s gone brown now that means the dye you picked wasn\u2019t light enough, you have to fill blonde hair before you dye it darker so the reason the dye washed out so fast is probably more because of how you dyed it not how it was washed. Good luck getting her back to her natural colour without bleach", "You are NTA. You are doing right by your child. Your ex needs a reality check as he mustn't care about your daughter's emotional well-being, only that he doesn't stand out at the BBQ. \n\nTrauma is trauma. Your ex needs to apologize to your child and try to fix the wound he created, regardless of whether you were able to fix his mistake with more dye.", "YTA.
