I've (20,F) been on vacation for almost 2 weeks with my dad (40s), his new girlfriend (late 30s) and her two children (7&6,M). We are getting ready to leave soon, therefore everything has been packed for renting purposes.\n\nAnyways, I was eating dinner standing by the kitchen counter because we put away the table we usually eat on. Then suddenly the two kids snuck up behind me and one of them (7 year old) slaps my ass which made me very angry and I yelled at the kid for doing it. After that I decided to talk to his mom and told her about the situation. To summarize, she told me I was inviting him to do it and in response I told her:\n\n\"Inviting him how? I was eating dinner.\" \n\"Well, you guys are always playing around.\" \n\"I literally never 'play' with him because he doesn't know how to respect boundaries and this time he really demonstrated that. Are you not going to tell him what he did was wrong?\" \n\"Why would I? You already yelled at him.\" \n\"But it's not my place to educate YOUR children and how they should behave around people.\" \n\"It's not, that's why I do it on my own terms.\" \n\"So, you taught them how to touch people inappropriately and to not respect boundaries?\"\n\nAfter that she just left the room. I haven't told my dad the whole situation yet, but he knows I'm upset with his new girlfriend. Should I tell him what happened? I'm just scared he's gonna side with her instead of me.\n\nI don't know if I'm in the wrong here, what do you guys think?\n\nEDIT:\nLike I responded to a comment under this post. I understand they are young, but it still doesn\u2019t justify their behavior.", "created_utc": 1673000459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104qr1z/aita_for_fighting_with_my_dads_new_girlfriend/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can see why they are who they are.\n\n\nYou tell your dad what happened and that you won't be accepting this in the future from her or her awful kids.", "NTA.  You did the right thing by telling their mom.  You probably should tell dad, or he is only going to get one side of the story.  He may side with GF.  If he does you'll know that you're not welcome any more.  Do what you think is best.", "NTA.\n\nYou might as well tell Dad and see who he \\*does\\* side with.  Delaying that moment achieves nothing.\n\nThe mom's response is wrong, but it's not completely psychotic -- everyone gets a bit defensive when their kids are criticized, right?  To be honest that fact that she wasn't all 'how dare you yell at my precious kids you EVIL HARPY' is kind of a positive sign.  Maybe it can be sorted out with clear boundaries and dialog.  Good luck.", "NTA. You need to know where your dad stands on this.", "NTA.\n\nI don't blame you for being mad. She needs to teach her children to stop doing that, period. And yeah, your dad needs to know, especially as he's also involved in their life now as a caretaker.\n\nI know that could hurt, depending on his answer. Just know you did the right thing. This kind of behavior has to stop right now, and her trying to first blame you, then taking zero responsibility for teaching them otherwise is just plain wrong.", "How old are you & these children?

I had a young sibling that pushed on my ass when I walked through the kitchen once, something my mother immediately put an end to. Sounds like daddy's girlfriend is raising a brat and she knows she can get away with it or your dad doesn't get a piece of tail. Unfortunately, you are most likely in a no-win situation. If you are in high school, time to start making plans to get away from these people. Unfortunately it will get worse.", "NTA. Talk to your father.", "NTA - and you should tell your dad - his gf isn\u2019t parenting her kids and tbh, this stuff will happen more if you don\u2019t involve him and show him that his gf isn\u2019t the best parent", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s also old enough to know that it gets a big fireworky reaction when he does it to certain of the adults around him, so it\u2019s rewarding to him in terms of attention to do that, and unless there\u2019s a consequence to it from his main caregivers, he will carry on. This is absolutely behaviour that ALL the adults in his life need to be supporting each other to correct so he doesn\u2019t grow up feeling entitled to women\u2019s bodies.\n\nMy nephew at a younger age went through a phase of tapping on my boob to get my attention - not out of anything deliberate or intent to harass, but just because it was the highest point on my body that he could easily reach. So I said to him that wasn\u2019t a good way to get my attention and told him he could touch my arm or hand instead,nor my shoulder if I was seated, and he never did it again - it should be that simple. But my sister and BIL have been talking to all their kids about bodily autonomy and consent since they were old enough to talk.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t need to be putting yourself into a situation where anybody makes you uncomfortable by invading your space.\n\nYou definitely should tell your dad - if he\u2019s going to be a role model for those kids he should know how they\u2019re representing him - but don\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s a little wary to get involved until he\u2019s seen that behaviour for himself or has made a personal attempt to get the kids to behave a little more appropriately. You might need to draw boundaries with him as well and make him reinforcing the reasonable boundaries you set with his partner\u2019s kids a condition of spending time with them in future - if these kids are going to be present whenever you see him and will carry on acting like that then it will make you want to see less of your dad as well as them, and he needs to understand that.", "NTA\n\nYou must tell your dad. First you are his daughter and it doesnt matter if its a child doing the inappropriate touching. But second these kids will probably be living with him soon if they are not and he needs to know the type of mother she is. \n\nAlso if you dont tell him before she does - its going to start ruining your relationship with him - she will always manipulate the details of the story.\n\nJust be factual, tell him its been multiple incidents of boundaries crossed, but you didnt say as they were kids but this instance is not acceptable and no one has a right to touch you like that without consent and you fear that if the mother doesnt tell them its not appropriate herself then it will be repeated.", "NTA \n\nTell your dad so that if she tries to lie to him at least he knows your side of the story. That\u2019s very inappropriate if mom doesn\u2019t correct that behavior now her kids are going get into a lot of trouble when they are older.", "NTA. Yes, they're young, that's why they did it, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be reprimanded. People don't simply educate themselves as they age, that's what parents are for and you're father's gf is neglecting her duty.", "NTA. A young male slapping a woman's ass is not appropriate, nor is it funny. It's kinda weird tbh.", "NTA. \n\nDad's new gf sounds like a peach.", "A complicated story ... If you are ready to accept any answer from your father, no matter which side he takes, then tell me if not, and you think your father's answer may hurt you more than the situation with the boy about illegal entry, then I would refuse it.", "I am 20 female and they\u2019re 7 & 6 males. I know they\u2019re young but it still doesn\u2019t make it okay, you know?", "Just the not respecting boundaries has been. I tried to keep it to myself because they\u2019re children, but this really crossed the line.", "I will do the edit to add the ages, thank you. And unfortunately it does feel like a no-win situation.", "They are old enough to learn that it isn't good behaviour.  I guarantee you aren't their only victim, I'd hate to be a classmate.", "Agreed and the mother sounds like she is the type to say the old phrase boys will be boys. You can just see an incel in the making"]}
