Suddenly my mom was extatic to be a grandma, and would fuss all over the baby whilst I was pregnant. I noticed that she started to distance herself from Ethan a lot more then usual.

Your mother should be thrilled, your relationship with Ethan and his father gave her a bonus grandchild she would otherwise have never had!\n\nThe world needs more people willing to ignore blood and follow their hearts.

Your mother is being heartless.", "As a parent who \"stepped up\" I can tell you that you need to stick to your guns. Most people don't realize that being a parent is more than just blood and DNA. Those only make you an egg or sperm donor. Being a parent means you love the child and you do the job of raising them. If your family has a problem with that then ghost them.

So basically all this drama started because you wanted to force your mother to have a relationship with a random kid", "Every night I tell him I love him. Just like any mother would", "It's not about the gift. That was just my last straw. She has constantly shown no interest in knowing him at all. She ignores his existence when he's done nothing wrong.

Good momma!", "She has no respect for you stepson why? Because 1. She just wanted to post only about her biological grandchild? 2. She wanted to buy gifts only for her biological grandchild? \n\nJust like its not your step sons fault that he is not yours biologically.
