Suddenly my mom was extatic to be a grandma, and would fuss all over the baby whilst I was pregnant. I noticed that she started to distance herself from Ethan a lot more then usual.

Thank you so much for the kind words", "I hope he remembers that I love him sm", "He chose for me to be his mom. I'm the lucky one here. Kudos to \"Ethan\" for making me a mom by choice", "The amount of comments of people emphasising that he's MY son just makes me feel a lot less bad about sticking up for him by arguing with my mom. Thank you all so much", "\"Tom\" is my boyfriend. But she can't say much as she was in a relationship for 12 years before she got married to the guy. But me and \"Tom\" have nothing to do with how she treats children. Not saying she has to love him like a grandchild because you can't force love. But what did \"Ethan\" do to deserve to be mistreated?", "You are correct in what you said to your mother. She is toxic. Time to go LC until she can conduct herself properly.", "I wish my mom loved me even a smidge as much as you love your son.

My mom clearly is blind", "Here, you dropped this \ud83d\udc51\n\nNTA", "Then maybe she would get the point that it's either BOTH of neither.", "Tell her that you will give her one more chance , next year.  Be sure to be strong during the holidays because human nature is to forgive and forget, and she doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "If she ever does gifting like that again (everything for one kid, or vastly unequal presents), then you and your son can go to a local shelter for women and children and donate it all.\n\nYou're a great mom!", "You are too sweet", "Thank you for the idea \ud83e\udd70"]}
