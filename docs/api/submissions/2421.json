While there is only a 9 year age gap between me and Ethan, we are very close.\n\nLittle bit of background information:\n\nI met Ethan when he was 10 almost 11, when I was 19 almost 20! (I previously wrote 22 almost 23, i got three hours of sleep.

My family liked Tom and Ethan from the start, but about a year into mine and Tom's relationship, Ethan started calling me mom, on his own terms, and after some discussion with him, he told me that I was more of a mother to him in a year then his mom ever was. He was young and just wanted a mother's love so I gave that to him.\n\nBut my mother's first issue was him calling me mom, she spoke to me about it and said that she \"wasn't comfortable being a grandmother yet.\" I told her that I didn't care what she thought and she had to accept it.\n\nThat same year, I unexpectedly got pregnant. Suddenly my mom was extatic to be a grandma, and would fuss all over the baby whilst I was pregnant. I noticed that she started to distance herself from Ethan a lot more then usual. It broke my heart but he told me that he didn't mind since \"She was just excited to have a baby in the family.\"\n\n9 months later my beautiful baby girl was born. \n\nWe took a picture of all 4 of us and posted it to our family group chat and also to Instagram. The issue is my mother wanted to announce the birth of my daughter, which was fine, but she used the same picture and ended up cropping Ethan out of it when posting on Facebook. I was furious and she eventually took the photo down. And so was Tom.\n\nRecently my mom just went on vacation and brought things back for everybody. It was a sweet gesture. My daughter Hope (Fake Name) who is just over a year old, got piled with gifts and toys. Ethan waited patiently but nothing ever came out her bag for him. When pulling her up on it, her excuse was \"I didn't see anything a teenage boy would like.\" It was very clear she just wanted to exclude Ethan.\n\nI snapped completely. We had a full on argument and I told her straight up \"Start treating both my kids the same or you will have to miss out on your grandkids growing up.\" Her response to me was \"Ethan is not your son..\" At this point my son is sobbing and my daughter wants out. Before we leave I whisper to her \"You are a heartless bitch who only cares about herself.\"\n\nEver since then, my family (besides my boyfriend and son) have been telling me to apologise but I refuse.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nFew update notes:\n.

That was probably the point in time where things went wrong and where YTA. Had you told her then that she didn't need to be a grandma but to please try and form any kind of relationship, it would never have come so far.", "Trust me I'm aware of this. I'm figuring something out right now. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\udc93", "I guess. All I want is for her not to ignore him. Trying to include him will make Ethan feel better (I've spoken to him recently about this)", "Good luck mama, you are doing so much for both of your children, they are lucky to have a mom like you in their life. \u2764\ufe0f", "Talk to your mother. Tell her any kind of relationship that an adult can have to a child would be fine. It wont be fixed tomorrow but if you can take the hard feelings away between Ethan (for being ignored by your mother), your mother (for being equally ignored by you) and yourself (the angry lioness defending her cubs) then you will be fine. Dont cut her out of your lifes. This can be sorted.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Yes. I understand whole \u2764\ufe0f. It\u2019s like it\u2019s okay for them to say \u201cWhatever\u201d and we\u2019re supposed to \u201cGet on with our lives\u201d as if what was said shouldn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t matter to use. Yes we have scars and they \u201cHurt!\u201d", "I wouldn\u2019t apologize. NTA", "NTA, and you are definitively doing the right and good thing. Make sure Ethan knows why her treatment upsets you, he should be old enough to understand.", "NTA. I have several Moms, all because all of them opened their hearts to me and we came to love one another. This woman has no idea what she is missing out on.", "NTA\n\nI'm happy that Ethan has you in his life. \nGood for you for standing up for your son and setting an example. \n\nI would go NC with her, your family doesn't deserve such nastiness and cruelty.", "NTA. thats like calling a cat a furry little monster. It is descriptive and accurate. Hope the adoption process goes smoothly!", "NTA Ethan chose you to be his mom and that is the most wonderful feeling. I will never understand adults excluding children. It's just mean and spiteful. Your mother is the AH", "W..OWWWW, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that smh. You're far from an asshole, and EASILY a good mom. You did/doing a great thing!!! Congrats on your family and best of luck to all of you!", "Y T A if you continue to allow this woman to be around your children in any capacity", "I don\u2019t understand people who won\u2019t even try to love adopted or non-bio children. NTA and I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re advocating for Ethan. You are creating a healthy home for a kid who\u2019s been through a lot.", "Why would you have this argument in front of your kids. I agree with you but not the place.", "\"Ethan\" has been reading some comments with me and this was his favourite one yet. Loved the \"Magic\" DNA part. Will do! Thank you", "ESH is a voting option here. Means everyone sucks here", "Heck I'm sure he would have loved having one of those souvenirs with his name on it.  My niece is 14 and still loves getting those (when we can find her name meant for a girl).", "OP then has zero obligation to let this woman have a relationship with HER DAUGHTER.", "If she can't treat both kids the same way then she doesn't deserve a relationship with any of them.  OP is the parent and can decide if this indeed horrible woman deserves a relationship with her children.", "Little fella had been through a lot but still comes out smiling. I'm so proud of him and can not wait to legally call him my son \ud83d\udc93. Granny time out is a need. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "I agree. She's missing out on one hell of a kid to love. He's amazing", "Thank you!", "All children deserved yo be loved", "It's the best feeling ever knowing someone chose me to be his mom. That means everything", "That's the goal! But I think people worry about not being able to love a kid like their own even if they aren't. But 9/10 you forget all about the fact your not blood to them and would take a bullet for them over and over again in a heartbeat", "I got angry and couldn't contain myself. I have since apologised to my son, my daughter is too little to understand so I just comforted her instead. Also my boyfriend I felt like I should apologise to him too.", "At least you showed your son you will not tolerate MILs hatred. My heart breaks for him that he had to hear that", "Is she toxic or does she have valid concerns about this age gap between her daughter and the man who had a kid at 16? And the age gap between her daughter and his child?  And the fact that the child's mom was well out of the picture and her *nineteen year old daughter* got roped into being a mother to someone else's kid?\n\nLike. I typically think step kids are family full stop. And the way the grandmother is going about things isn't right *at all* but can we stop for a moment and remember we have a very biased perspective here, and there are actually valid concerns to be had here?", "\ud83e\udd7a", "OP doesn't want her daughter to think that her brother is less than her because this AH Grandma thinks he is.", "Thank YOU for being brave enough to share that story", "You're an awesome mom"]}
