I think it\u2019s more than reasonable for your parents to ask for rent now, especially since their financial circumstances have changed. Your dad should probably also be gainfully employed, but you and your sister are adults, so he is under no obligation to take care of you financially anymore.\n\nSounds like it\u2019s time to move out. Maybe you and your sister can find a place together or with other roommates to help with costs.", "NAH but close to Y.TA. You got a good deal (no rent) for a pretty long while. But times change and the current economic problems have hit a lot of people hard so I\u2019m not going to judge your parents too harshly for wanting rent and needing it on time.  Your father sounds like an AH but the person I feel bad for is your mother.", "YTA. You're 22 right? \nWhy are you still living with mom and dad?\nOn top of that, you took a pay cut to work in your field. It's nice to work in the field you went to school for, but that doesn't pay the bills. \nIt was an irresponsible decision.", "NAH\n\nSounds like you are ready to move out since you don't want to pay what they expect.", "This is a hard one. I completely agree with those who say that you should be paying rent because you are an adult living with your parents and should contribute to expenses. BUT your dad is certainly an asshole for yelling with a straight face at you for not paying your rent on time, when sounds like a deadbeat. Like dad should have a bit of shame here. But in any case, OP since it looks like you don't have any other options, just try your best to stay away from dad and do the best you can.", "Listen, trade school is two years.\nYou were done with high school around 18. You're parents probably didn't expect you to drag it out until you were 22.\nThey gave you 4 years to get your shit together it's time to pay rent or get out", "ESH.\n\nYour father sounds financially irresponsible and he\u2019s taking it out on you but you\u2019re 22 years old and still dragging this out. Just move out.", "YTA - Gen X has joined the chat. \n\nMy mother prorated my rent on my 18th birthday. Instead of a gift I had to pay her half a months rent. \n\nI moved out at 18, went to college, paid my own tuition, rent, and car payment.\n\nI get that it sucks, but you're both technically legal adults. Your parents duty to you is done, everything now is a gift.", "Oh my God your Dad is a huge AH. I stopped believing people like him still existed, Firstly charging your own children rent? And secondly everything else about his shitty self. I suggest moving out it's better for your sanity.", ">HIS lack of interest in finding a job resulted in my need to help pay the bills\n\nI take issue with this. You need to help pay the bills because you're a working adult and you need to pay for your living situation. They supported you for a few years already, they're entitled to change the deal and ask you for help if you want to keep living with them. \n\nIf you don't like the arrangement and don't think it's fair, you can live on your own and pay market rate for rent and see how a real landlord will take it when you're late paying them\n\n>disinterest in having a job to support us\n\nYou're 22 and work full time, why does he have to support you? \n\n>AITA for not wanting to pay my parents rent?\n\nI'm not going to say you're TA because no one *wants* to pay rent... but I don't really agree with your expectation of free rent from your parents as a college-educated fully employed adult.\n\nNAH", "YTA\n\nYou live there so you should contribute to the expenses.\n\nYour parents financial situation has changed since they made the deal, hence they need to look at the needs and means of the home, which includes you ans your sister\n\nWould be able to find an apartment for the rent you give your parents?", "YTA and why would you take a job that\u2019s more hours and a 50% cut in wages? That is not a smart thing. Also yes you are an adult so you can pay rent.", "Also, you're basshing your dad for quitting his job to work on his start-up... he literally doesn't owe you anything because \nYOU ARE AN ADULT", "When we were 18, paying cheap rent,\n A GOOD paying job was anything over 0 dollars.\nOP, your argument doesn't work.", "ESH . Your father blaming his financial woes on you is uncool.... but so is your refusal to acknowledge that situations change.  I have a kid the same age as you.  They also live at home while they work full time.  They pay me $250/ month for rent,  food,  all utilities,  streaming services, etc.  We work as a team and I LOVE having them here while they save so they can be as debt free as possible when ready to move. But if the situation changed and suddenly my income dropped? That $250 would need to rise, unfortunately.  The choice quickly becomes pay more but still have a great deal,  or go your own way and pay.... 3x more. You need to decide if not dealing with your father is worth 3x more to you.", "YTA.\n\nLiving there costs money. Welcome to adulthood. Do you expect to be 50 and living with your parents? And times change, I'm betting your parents assumed you'd want to live on your own asap, like most adults.", "No, there isn't any shame in living at home until you're 23 or 24, but if things have changed and now they expect her to pay rent, then she needs to pay rent.", "You clearly have no concept of how much more you living under that roof raises the over expense  you say you make 300 per month. That's 1200. I promise even with your contributions it's costing that much amd more to have you there.", "My mother is an absolute saint to put up with him. She is the sole income provider for them (my sister and I provide everything for ourselves aside from paying the mortgage). And despite this, HE was the one demanding rent.", "I went to trade school, so I am in an apprenticeship year. My projected salary after this year is much more than I was making bartending so it is a temporary sacrifice and prior to my parents demanding rent, they had agreed not to while I complete my apprenticeship. My parents wanted me to live with them to save money for my future, like most parents whose children are young adults.", "Not everyone moves out at soon as they turn 18. It\u2019s actually a lot more common for people to live with their parents longer. I moved out when I was 23, almost 24. There\u2019s no shame in that.", "Thank you for a reasonable response lol. I feel like I've really done my part in the past by paying 100% of my own bills and even doing things like grocery shopping for them when money was tight, but wasn't sure if this was crossing the line to him using me instead of working. Thank you!", "We made this deal with the premise of me moving out when my tuition is paid off and my apprenticeship was complete. My father deciding not to work so that I could pay his bills for him was never discussed lol.", "You are very lucky to have been able to do that! Unfortunately the price of rent now is most likely drastically different compared to when you were moving out. The issue isn't the act of paying rent, it's the reason behind it.", "> Firstly charging your own children rent?\n\nyour grown children who work full time? why should he support adults with full time jobs and college degrees?", "Currently trying to find an apartment/living situation I can afford! The cheapest apartments in my area are over $1200/month so it's been tough", "The reason I said \"support us\" basically meant support them. I guess it was a bad choice of words. But the only way they support me is by paying for the roof over my head, I pay for everything else myself, and have since I started working at 16.", "There are absolutely NO apartments in my state for $400 a month, I've looked and continue to. And the reason their financial situation changed was because he chose to quit his job and not work.", "The new job is a job in my field with great potential to make much more in a couple years, when I was planning to move out.", "He has a fake \"start-up\". It's not real, it's his excuse to not have a job.", "The key there is \"cheap rent\". Rent is no longer cheap.", "My parents and I talked about the living situation when I finished school. We all expected I would move out when I finish my apprenticeship and start making enough money to be able to. It was never a \"live here till you're 50\" kind of deal.", "I already pay for my own food, phone bill, insurance, the streaming services they use instead of cable, pay 1/4 when we get oil in the winter, and half the electric bill. It's really not costing them much at all for me to live there.", "I am sure he took his guilt and shame out on you. It sounds like he does not know how to process his emotions.", "22-18 = 4\nYou've had 4 years.", "Exactly! Thank you for a reasonable response lol.", "YUP, if dad is an able bodied adult he needs to be working. Because he can't count on you and sis to live with you parents and contribute to their expenses forever.", "At this point, I'd like to talk to your parents and offer to pay them myself if they kick your entitled ass out", "It's all relative. My rent was 3 weeks of my income. I ate a lot of baked potatoes because they were free at work. Entertainment was limited to 1 drink at some bar that had a happy hour buffet.", "If I still wanted or allowed my children to live with me full time when I'm grown I probably won't be asking them to pay. They're my kids after all.", "That is all well and fine, and I agree with you, but shouldn't he be pulling his own weight here as well?", "That's too bad. I wish you luck though", "And how much do you pay all said and done after paying $400 rent, and all of the other expenses you have been contributing to?", "> There are absolutely NO apartments in my state for $400 a month, I've looked and continue to\n\nDamn sounds like your parents are giving you a great deal, then.", "And that is his right! \nHe doesn't owe you anything anymore \nHe doesn't even have to invite you for the holidays, let alone explain to you why he doesn't work.\nHis financial situation and his lack of employment doesn't have anything to do with you!", "I'm literally rolling my eyes at you right now.\nHow much do you make an hour", "Isn't it a quarter of what you make? I feel like that's pretty cheap for rent. But I'm used to discussing how expensive rent is!", "Water, sewage, garbage... home repairs, homeowners insurance, paper towels toilet paper garbage bags want me to keep going?", "Yes, 4 years to pay $35,000 in tuition to stay in school!", "Exactly. Even if I could afford to move out and get an apartment, if I left they would most likely lose the house because my mother is the sole income earner.", "This living situation goes both ways at the moment, since my dad chooses not to work, when I move out without my rent, they'll likely lose the house. So I'm helping them out a great deal. The basis of the post was my father chooses not to work, so I have to pay his bills for him. AITA for not wanting to pay his bills? \nYou likely fell into a lucky situation where you found an affordable apartment when you moved out. Most people now are not so lucky.", "That's generous of you. But I don't think it's fair to say that anyone who doesn't feel like supporting a fully employed, college-educated adult is an AH. It's not unreasonable to expect all the employed adults that live together to contribute to shared living expenses. Family or no, OP needs to act like an adult, not a kid.", "> shouldn't he be pulling his own weight here as well\n\nThat's between him and his wife, not OP.", "After my rent, car payment/insurance, phone bill, electric,  groceries, ect is paid, I'm left with about $75 dollars at the end of the month which I do put into a savings account.", "I guess that's just where our opinions differ then. In my opinion, if I was a parent and promised my child a place to live, I would work to make sure that didn't change!", "I make $300 a week. Many of my financial decisions like which car I could afford and what school I could afford depended on the fact I did not expect to be paying rent until my apprenticeship year was over.", "It's a little over a quarter. But I made other financial decisions based off the fact I wouldn't have to pay rent while I complete my apprenticeship, and that's where my problem lies. And there's not much I can do to change it until my apprenticeship is over unfortunately", "Well she stated that she pitches in on other expenses, I'll expect even my kids to do that. If she was grown and then completely freeloading then it would be an issue.", "That wasn't my point. You were speaking about what her responsibility should be as an adult. Would that not apply to her father as well?", "Life throws stuff at us.\nSo now that the arrangement has changed, you downgrade your vehicle or get a second job.\nYou said trade school took 2 years, but you're 22. There are 2 unaccounted years.\n\nYour parents are right to charge you rent.", "Their financial situation changed. I'm sure it would benefit them to get rid of the house and get somewhere far smaller, and more within their budget. But they're asking for minimal rent instead. I get that you made decisions based on an offer that they can no longer provide. But you have to get over that, and not act like you were entitled to this huge gift they tried to give you indefinitely, and only manages to give for 4 years. They're still giving you an excellent deal, after all.", "> Well she stated that she pitches in on other expenses\n\nOK but for almost everyone shelter is their greatest expense. I just disagree entirely that anyone is an AH for wanting a working adult who lives in the house with them to contribute to the expense of living in that house.", "> Would that not apply to her father as well?\n\nMarried couples often share their finances between them as a unit. How the married couple divides their finances is between them, not anyone else. If mom demands dad contributes, he should contribute. If mom and dad have an arrangement where one works and the other doesn't, that's between them. Either way, it doesn't involve OP or the rent OP pays or doesn't pay in any way.", "Those years were spent paying off tuition for school, that I went to because knowing I wouldn't be charged rent, I could afford it lol.", "My only hesitation about paying them rent is that the only reason I need to is because my father chose to quit his job and not work so we could pay his bills. All in all I'm getting a better deal that I would ordinarily, it's just the reasoning behind it that irks me.", "Ok my bad he isn't an asshole for that in particular. But you can agree he could've handled it better", "Parents allow their children to live at home rent free with the purpose of them saving money for their future. If I'm supporting myself entirely aside from the roof over my head, and contributing things like food shopping for them, do you really think it's entirely unreasonable for a parent to continue paying the mortgage on their own like they have their child's entire life?", "> Parents allow their children to live at home rent free with the purpose of them saving money for their future\n\nThey've been doing that for some years now, haven't they? Have you saved up? \n\n>I'm supporting myself entirely aside from the roof over my head\n\nAside from most people's costliest expense, that often takes up 30-50% of a person's income? \n\nYou're an adult, you're out of college, you live in a house and you don't want to contribute to the cost of keeping that house available as a place for you to live. I do not have sympathy for that. Adults contribute to the upkeep of the shelter that keeps them from being homeless. You are an adult, you live in a home with other adults. Time to contribute like an adult instead of wanting to continue to be treated like a kid.", "I have not saved enough money to move out of my house. I worked full time bartending for 2 years while in trade school and almost 80% of my income went towards my tuition payments because I paid for it myself and did not receive financial aid loans. So my saving pretty much starts now, since I just finished paying my loans."]}
