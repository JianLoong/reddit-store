{"id": 1257, "submission_id": "ym6xu1", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay my parents rent after we made a deal?", "selftext": "So for background I (22F) my sister (19F) and my parents made a deal for when we graduated highschool. The deal was this: after highschool graduation, if we were either in school full time OR working full time, we would not have to pay them rent and could stay in the house as long as we wanted. However, we DO pay for all of our own college tuition, cars payments/gas, clothes, and buy and cook our own food. We are both pretty great at money management. \n\nNow, it's been a couple years. My sister went 6 months no school or job and my parents didn't ask her to pay rent (she has a FT job now). Whereas I immediately went to school full time AND worked a bartending job 36 hours a week. So I didn't pay rent either, I upheld my end of the deal. I recently started a full time (50hrs a week) job in my field and took a huge pay cut (about 50% less) to do so. \n\nThis entire time, my father has not had a real job. He doesn't work and is unemployed and despite my mom and I sending him jobs to apply to, he doesn't do it. He stays home all day and pretends to work on a \"start up\" that hasn't made progress in years. This has resulted in my family being financially insecure. My parents recently told my sister and I we have to start paying rent. About $400 a month for me, and $300 a month for my sister (even though she makes more money than I do, I have an electric car so I pitch in more to cover the electric bill). Now, normally I would be okay and understanding that I need to help my parents out seeing as I live in the house too, BUT here's where my dilemma is: \n\nI make much less money now, so on 2 months I was a couple days late with my rent payment. Instead of being understanding, my father came at me with nasty comments blaming their account overdraft on me. This is where I start to get angry. HIS lack of interest in finding a job resulted in my need to help pay the bills, violating a promise they made to me. And I am met with nasty comments and anger when I don't have the money for a couple days and their account overdrafts.\n\nSo, I feel like my father's lack of responsibility and disinterest in having a job to support us is taken out on me when I scrape together what little money I have a couple days late for rent, that they promised I would never be asked to pay.\n\n AITA for not wanting to pay my parents rent?", "created_utc": 1667587643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6xu1/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_parents_rent_after/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
