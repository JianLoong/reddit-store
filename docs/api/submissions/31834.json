We were very excited and would often talk about our plans for the house.\r\nThen I got pregnant, and we asked to just move in with them since the place we were living in was too small to raise a baby and we were planning on buying their house anyway. They said yes and were super excited about it and we moved in.\r\n\r\nWe made a few adjustments to the house while we all lived there. We didn\u2019t want to make any changes to the house until it was ours, but they were adamant about some things (like the carpet).

FIL complained constantly that they were going to be broke having to buy a 300k house. They would have to take money out of their 401k. I did not want to burden them so much financially just because they wanted to be generous to us. I heard them talking about it and raised my concerns and they freaked out at me and said we can\u2019t turn it down.\r\n\r\nI talked with my husband about this and how I thought we should back out of our deal and buy a different house. We have less expensive tastes, we agreed on wanting a ranch under 200k and we already had 100k saved up for a down payment/renovations. \r\nHe ended up agreeing and we sat down with his parents and said how we didn\u2019t want the house, and we would just buy a different one.\r\nThey were PISSED and yelled at us and said we weren\u2019t allowed to back out just because they were complaining about the cost of a new house. We ended up having to lie that the main reason wasn\u2019t their finances when it was. They gave us the silent treatment for about a week.\r\n\r\nAfter that they sat us down and told us that we weren\u2019t allowed to change our minds. They\u2019re keeping their house and already planned some renovations to the kitchen and other areas.\r\n\r\nToday, over a year later, they still live in their house and plan to stay in it for the foreseeable future. We have a house that met our preferences. I love it, but my husband has issues with it.

You have $100k saved with a total budget of $200k, but a $300k home is completely unattainable and for the rich?  I get you dont want that monthly payment, but I dont get how there is class status difference between the two.

I couldn't figure out why your in-laws were complaining about having to buy a new house but ALSO complaining when you offered to basically let them out of selling their house to you at a huge loss for themselves. People this mercurial are difficult to work with because you really can have no idea what they really want, what they can really afford, or anything. But I would say that if they were indeed going to have to dip into their 401K to replace the house they were going to sell/gift you, then they probably couldn't really afford to sell/gift you (i.e. sell to you at a huge loss) their house. \n\nThe best conclusion I can come up with here is that your in-laws are torn between really wanting to be generous to you, and also not really being able to quite afford the generosity they want to show. I think if my husband was lying awake at night worrying that he should have taken their house, I might tell him, do you really wish we had basically raided your parents' retirement savings so we could have had a nicer house? Aren't we really better off if we can feel that they are well-funded for their retirement, so we don't have to worry about them running out of savings?\n\n With the choices you and your husband have made, you have a nice home that you can both afford.  The two of you are successfully standing on your own feet. Your parents right now are able to benefit from their own savings, which is as it should be. If his parents really can afford to make him a significant gift, they can do it in their wills, which means he'll be willed the amount they can truly afford to give him, ie. what money is left over after they've lived their lives to the full.

Talk to your husband to see if he wants to approach them about buying the house in the future.  They might want to downsize or move into a different type of accommodation as they age.

You should have let your husband deal with his parents and really not interfered with their dynamic.  You came from a place of caring, but in this case, you should have stayed neutral.  If it is something still burning in your husband's mind and you are okay with it, tell him that if his parents still want to sell to you and your husband, tell him you are fine with moving into his parents' house and you can sell the one you currently have.  If you do this, make certain that your husband realizes he is doing the heavy lifting with his parents - period.", "NTA. His parents initially sounded very generous.

We managed to sneak in money to bare minimum pay for the extra utilities costs and we paid for our groceries ourselves, but they would return any money we gave them above that). So they were very generous on helping us build up that savings. We lived with them for about a year.\n\nThe reason they were complaining about the mortgage for a 300k house is because they didn't have a down payment and they suck at saving. Their monthly payment would be closer to 3k a month whereas ours is only 800 since we were able to save so much on the down payment and we bought a 160k house and put like 40k in renovations.

You made this choice together. It may have been your idea, but you didn't buy a house alone. If he regrets his choice, that's fine, but it's not fair or right for him to translate that into resentment towards you. He must accept the past and let it go if he doesn't want to poison the future.\n\nHe should also consider that the dream house still exists and he's very likely to get it in the future anyway. That's a lot of house for two elderly people to keep up with, they may want to downsize in the future and sell it to you, or decide to retire somewhere warm, or need to go into assisted living when they get older, etc. So hubby should have a sit and calm his tits. Things will work out eventually.\n\nFinally, on your front, consider that the apple may not fall far from the tree here. Your husband is doing an awful lot of complaining and second guessing...

It was always a trap.", "I can kinda see it:\n\n* the in-laws make good money, or at least claim to;\n* they live a lifestyle that backs up the assertion: nice house, expensive habits/vacation/remodeling/whatever;\n* the apparent wealth is not real because they have not been saving/investing appropriately, not even increasing equity in the house (both OP and OP's husband believe the illusion that \"parents are wealthy\");\n* parents dangle the house in front of their son: \"this could be yours\", with the string attached that they can't actually afford it;\n* OP's husband is naturally disappointed when it is apparent that the house offer is conditional (to say the least);\n* OP's husband blames OP for reality not matching up with fantasy.", ">I mean it WAS a fantastic deal\n\n*If* the parents relinquished ownership both on paper and in practice.", "The reason we backed out was because we didn't want to screw them over financially. It would have been extremely beneficial financially to us. Our financial situation was never a worry", "300k all at once is a lot, but they're talking about mortgages. And struggling to pay for a down payment on a 300k house after having their home bought for 150k. It just makes no sense, and it's clear they're not rich.", "Why do you think that? I'm too confused to even give a judgement lol", ">They do make a lot of money\n\n*If* that's true, they've been squandering it - perhaps making lifestyle decisions that mean that they didn't build any wealth (savings, equity in the house, investment).\n\n>They have the money\n\nThey really don't. They get money in, and they spend it. They don't *have* it - unless they do, and they are lying about dipping into the 401K. My guess is they were never going to leave the house, and your money was meant to fund the renovations, with money to spare.", "220k is closer to a down payment than a house price in my state \ud83d\ude2d", "Rural Midwest or South. The neighborhood I grew up in outside of Kansas City, where farmland meets suburbs, still has houses under $200k. Granted, my hometown is a shit hole and seems to be only getting more decrepit as time goes on.", "Same. I love our little townhome but it\u2019s physically painful to write that $3000 mortgage check each month.

It's gone up in value since, but we also live in a relatively expensive part of our region. The same home 25 miles north would probably be 300k ish.", "> My definition of rich may not be what everyone else is thinking. \n\nYour definition of \u2018rich\u2019 isn\u2019t what *anyone* is thinking. It sounds like they can barely afford their current house, raiding their retirement to  \u2018trade up\u2019 to something still relatively modest makes no sense at all.\n\nThey should stay where they are and focus on paying it down before they worry about anything else. You and your partner should stay well away from their financial situation and I don\u2019t understand where the \u2018dream house\u2019 talk came from either, if your husband\u2019s idea of a dream house is living in mommy and daddy\u2019s old home then he needs better dreams.", "Uh, where is 200 a house anymore?", "I agree with you 100% angler. But I\u2019m wondering if what was really going on was they were complaining about the cost of purchasing another house as a way to sort of \u201cchum the waters\u201d so to speak. And actually expected OP and hubby to simply make the offer that they all share the house together since they were getting such a good deal on the price.", "Rural Texas it\u2019s still a house. Not even a bad one. However the main payment is that you have to live in rural Texas.", "Well, shit happens, and the only thing you can do now it's to talk to him, and turn this self blame into a solution. He doesn't like his house? It's sad, what he wants to do now? Any plans of buying a new one, after you will be done with paying for this one? Having a plan can make him feel better, he won't feel trapped in his house forever. Also it's good to decide how you will avoid him being forced into something doesn't want just because you want it. He needs to learn how to say no (hard job with parents like his) and you need to work on limiting your pressure. Good luck!", "This is possible by either:\n\nThis is fiction\n\nOr\n\nThey are all financially illiterate.\n\nOr even\u2026 both", "they probs have a 30yr mortgage and their payment with rough math only would be roughly 500 a month so my guess is they pay the minimum and live above their means since OP said they are not good at saving.", "If she works for the government as a GS, it maxes out around 145k at GS 15 level.  Thing is, around majority government work location, there's a usual corellating higher cost of living because of the steady job salary. \n\n\nIt's as if your in-laws are pretending to be better off financially than they are. If they make 150-200+k in a relatively low cost of living area where is the money vanishing to?  Because $300k houses are only big houses in areas where the average wage & salary are low. So if they are \"high income\" for where you're at, then it's going somewhere.\n\nNTA\nYour husband is whining. If you were waiting on his parents to move out, I bet you'd all still be living in THEIR house together.  I doubt they ever did once they realized how much it would really cost.", "I\u2019ve only owned my home for 2.5 years, and without paying extra towards principal, I\u2019ve still managed to pay down the loan balance ~$11k. I\u2019m showing the avg rate for 2013 was ~1.23 percentage points higher than mine (to be fair my starting balance was also higher), so without running the actual math, I guess it could only pay $25k of principal in 10 years, but it still seems odd to me.", "NTA\nThey wanted the Bitching Rights, and you took those from them. Some people are only happy when they have something to complain about, and/or someone to feel superior to. \nGood on you, OP for not falling for it."]}
