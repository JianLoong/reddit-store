They live in a house that they bought over a decade ago for around 175k and is now worth over 300k.\r\r\nThey offered to sell us their house for 150k. We gratefully accepted, and planned on taking the house in a few years once they saved up for a down payment. We were very excited and would often talk about our plans for the house.\r\nThen I got pregnant, and we asked to just move in with them since the place we were living in was too small to raise a baby and we were planning on buying their house anyway. They said yes and were super excited about it and we moved in.\r\n\r\nWe made a few adjustments to the house while we all lived there. We didn\u2019t want to make any changes to the house until it was ours, but they were adamant about some things (like the carpet). His parents said it was fine to do other things like paint and install lights, but afterwards FIL got mad and said we were trying to kick them out of their house.\r\n\r\nThey started looking at houses. FIL complained constantly that they were going to be broke having to buy a 300k house. They would have to take money out of their 401k. I did not want to burden them so much financially just because they wanted to be generous to us. I heard them talking about it and raised my concerns and they freaked out at me and said we can\u2019t turn it down.\r\n\r\nI talked with my husband about this and how I thought we should back out of our deal and buy a different house. We have less expensive tastes, we agreed on wanting a ranch under 200k and we already had 100k saved up for a down payment/renovations. \r\nHe ended up agreeing and we sat down with his parents and said how we didn\u2019t want the house, and we would just buy a different one.\r\nThey were PISSED and yelled at us and said we weren\u2019t allowed to back out just because they were complaining about the cost of a new house. We ended up having to lie that the main reason wasn\u2019t their finances when it was. They gave us the silent treatment for about a week.\r\n\r\nAfter that they sat us down and told us that we weren\u2019t allowed to change our minds. They\u2019re keeping their house and already planned some renovations to the kitchen and other areas.\r\n\r\nToday, over a year later, they still live in their house and plan to stay in it for the foreseeable future. We have a house that met our preferences. I love it, but my husband has issues with it. Occasionally when the in-laws come over, they\u2019ll find something negative to comment about and say something like \u201cyou could have had a nicer house.\u201d\n\r\nMy husband told me recently after one of these comments that he couldn\u2019t sleep for a week because he regretted our decision and that was his dream house and he wishes we would have gotten it. There\u2019s no way we can afford a house like that at full price and he hates how small ours is. He says how his parent are rich and they would have been fine, his dad just likes to complain.\r\nHe doesn\u2019t blame me but I know I caused us to back out.", "created_utc": 1701063789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184vr4b/aita_for_talking_my_husband_out_of_his_dream/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have $100k saved with a total budget of $200k, but a $300k home is completely unattainable and for the rich?  I get you dont want that monthly payment, but I dont get how there is class status difference between the two.

How would they not have enough for the down payment if you\u2019re paying them $150k? \n\nWhy not offer your full budget of $200k?

I couldn't figure out why your in-laws were complaining about having to buy a new house but ALSO complaining when you offered to basically let them out of selling their house to you at a huge loss for themselves. People this mercurial are difficult to work with because you really can have no idea what they really want, what they can really afford, or anything. But I would say that if they were indeed going to have to dip into their 401K to replace the house they were going to sell/gift you, then they probably couldn't really afford to sell/gift you (i.e. sell to you at a huge loss) their house. \n\nThe best conclusion I can come up with here is that your in-laws are torn between really wanting to be generous to you, and also not really being able to quite afford the generosity they want to show. I think if my husband was lying awake at night worrying that he should have taken their house, I might tell him, do you really wish we had basically raided your parents' retirement savings so we could have had a nicer house? Aren't we really better off if we can feel that they are well-funded for their retirement, so we don't have to worry about them running out of savings?\n\n With the choices you and your husband have made, you have a nice home that you can both afford.  The two of you are successfully standing on your own feet. Your parents right now are able to benefit from their own savings, which is as it should be. If his parents really can afford to make him a significant gift, they can do it in their wills, which means he'll be willed the amount they can truly afford to give him, ie. what money is left over after they've lived their lives to the full. I think that sounds about right.", "NTA. They\u2019d have made comments about it until the day they died, at which point you\u2019d get the house anyway.", "NTA. You made the best decision for the two of you and his parents, using the information available at the time. **Your husband agreed** with you about the decision.\n\nYour husband is now suffering from major buyer's regret\n\nThis is primarily caused by his parents' ingratitude that you didn't accept their $150K gift and are attempting (successfully) to rub it in and find fault in your house.\n\nThe best thing you two could do to stop losing sleep over this would be to not let his parents visit at your place any more.", "Sorry where do you live that 300k is a rich house?", "None of this makes any sense.", "NTA\n\nIf your in-laws needed a few years to \u201csave up for a down payment\u201d for a $300K house they are not rich.\n\nThey offered you a generous gift but it\u2019s probably the best decision to not accept at this time.  Talk to your husband to see if he wants to approach them about buying the house in the future.  They might want to downsize or move into a different type of accommodation as they age.  He could let them know he still likes their family home and would like the right to have a first chance at buying it if they do ever want to sell.", "NTA. His parents are not rich.

Don\u2019t let them get to you.", "NTA, but you probably should have resisted the temptation to 'fix' your ILs problem.  You should have let your husband deal with his parents and really not interfered with their dynamic.  You came from a place of caring, but in this case, you should have stayed neutral.  If it is something still burning in your husband's mind and you are okay with it, tell him that if his parents still want to sell to you and your husband, tell him you are fine with moving into his parents' house and you can sell the one you currently have.  If you do this, make certain that your husband realizes he is doing the heavy lifting with his parents - period.", "NTA. His parents initially sounded very generous. They soon let the facade slip and you would have been made to feel indebted to them forever. That's if they eventually ever moved out. That house didn't come with \"strings attached\" it came with chains! Enjoy your new home Op.", "I don\u2019t know if you are the AH here, but I think you made an incredibly good and responsible purchase.

They'd probably have complained about that every time they visited you.", "NTA. Your in-laws sound really pushy. I imagine if you bought their house from them, they would have still acted as if they owned the place.\n\nAlso the in-laws aren\u2019t rich. 300k house is pretty cheap.

We wanted a house we could pay off in 5 to 10 years. With our mindset, we just say we can't afford anything like that. Though I guess we can.

Just say small rural town then.", "I had a lot more info in here originally but went over the character limit. My definition of rich may not be what everyone else is thinking. In our area, a 300k house is 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom, fancy 3 story home in a keeping with the Joneses type neighborhood. MIL makes 6 figs and FIL makes around 70k. This is very good for where we are. \n\nMy husband and I are very fortunate to not have any debt thanks to scholarships and are now making a good amount. We saved for years on a down payment because when we first moved out we got a really cheap rental and thought we could buy a house outright once we saved up. but then the housing market turned the way it is and the house prices doubled so that only worked so well.\n\nAlso when we moved in with his parents, they didn't make us pay rent, which also allowed to us save a lot of money (this is another situation where we wanted to pay and they refused. We managed to sneak in money to bare minimum pay for the extra utilities costs and we paid for our groceries ourselves, but they would return any money we gave them above that). So they were very generous on helping us build up that savings. We lived with them for about a year.\n\nThe reason they were complaining about the mortgage for a 300k house is because they didn't have a down payment and they suck at saving. Their monthly payment would be closer to 3k a month whereas ours is only 800 since we were able to save so much on the down payment and we bought a 160k house and put like 40k in renovations. That is one of the big reasons why I didn't want to go with the deal because we were already in a good place with our money to buy a house, and they weren't.", "What part of the country is this?  And part of \u201cbeing pretty rich\u201d is having substantial SAVINGS. Not just income.  Really, people in their 40s or 50s should be doing better than that, esp if MIL allegedly makes 6 figures."]}
