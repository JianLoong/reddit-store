I think I\u2019d probably buy the computer. You say he uses it for a social aspect and I\u2019d be concerned about what the lack that ability would do. I also think I would sit down my parents and dial in why they think it\u2019s my responsibility to do this.", "NTA - you bought it as a part of a bigger thing that he never took advantage of. If your brother is disabled, doesn't he have income from social security disability? If so, why can't they use some of that money to replace his computer? Also, no one replaces gifts when they break, that's just unheard of.\n\nIf you want to be nice, wait until xmas or his birthday and buy the cheaper one. I wouldn't just make it a random gift. It also wouldn't hurt to take the laptop to a repair shop to see if it just needs a new motherboard or something.\n\nLastly, what about buying a used computer that your parents pitch in to help pay for?", "nta \n\nIt's my understanding that with serious mental illness he should be getting disability \n\nHe can save up his own spare money to either purchase a new computer or put towards his parents helping him get one. \n\nYou bought him a gift. A one off gift. There is no requirement to replace what is broken.", "NTA. I\u2019m physically disabled and am on SSDI. My check isn\u2019t much more than what someone would get if they were on SSI. Which I assume your brother is on or he\u2019s on SSDI based on your parents SSA account since he was disabled before the age of 22 which could mean his check is a lot higher than mine (if y\u2019all don\u2019t have him on any benefits then y\u2019all are really screwing around and would definitely be T A H). So with all this background on my benefits, I save up to get myself anything extra I might want. I\u2019ve gotten myself a nice laptop (less than 300 on amazon) and even saved up to get myself a PS5. I do have a couple credit cards but they are only for medical expenses only as I sometimes have to travel to 10 hours away for appointments and am using them that way to build my credit back up after medical debt destroyed my credit while applying for disability.", "NTA. Get him to apply for a library card. He can use the computers for free there.", "NTA whatever you decide. Do whatever you choose to do because you want to, not because it is expected or not. You have no obligation, it's simply what you want to give.", "NTA. You bought him one for school and it's obvious he's not going to school nor does he seem interested. You tried. If your parents want to help him, that's their business but they are also being unreasonable expecting you to supply your brother with a  new one.", "NTA why can't he buy it himself? He should be getting disability. It sounds like your parents are fleecing you.", "They say they support him in myriad other ways, and they feel this is how I should show my support.", "No idea why the computer died. I know he used it constantly. He said it's not repairable, and I am just going on his word, because I know nothing. I should really take it in to a professional. I don't know why I didn't think of that.\n\nIt is expected that when my parents are unable/no long here, that I will take care of him.   They have some money set aside for him, but I'm supposed to dole it out to him so that it lasts. \n\nI've tried to set him up with the county vocational program, but he won't go and he becomes aggressive when they call or come over. He is incredibly smart and there is so much he could do with himself, but his behavior gets in the way.", "He has schizophrenia. He is genuinely very ill.", "I think as long as he doesn't use a computer for coursework, a cheap tablet is plenty.\n\nNTA. Tell him it has to last X years.", "You already did. You gave him a good laptop, and he ruined it in less than two years. Or are you going to be expected to buy one every year whenever he destroys it? No.", "NTA.  He is an adult which means the list of people obligated to support him starts and ends with him, and in extraordinary circumstances, his PARENTS.", "Well i you are definetly not an asshole for that but also not exacly innocent too. You changed his way of living when you bought him the computer even if you didnt meant this way but still it was you started all of this. \u0130 am not saying  have to buy it but if 200-300 $ isnt that much of a money to you, i think you should buy i mean its family right. But if its a big amount well you dont have to spend that money just to entertain him \n\nAlso if you buy it again they will expect you to buy a computer every now and then. \nWhat i can i advise you is this: if you want to buy a conputer for him just give the money to your parents and tell them to buy it instead of you and let them tell ita from them not you. So next time he friea the computer, he will not expect you to buy again", "Nta", "NTA Buy him a chromebooknwith the google opwrating system.

It's one thing if you had told him you would get him one, talked up how great it was, then didn't.  You would be mean.  But you bought him the computer and he didn't follow through with his end of going to college.  Maybe had he gone to college and the original computer broke and he needs it for classes or he was able to work with the computer and create things with it, something more than it being a toy, OP might feel differently about getting him another one.

Have your parents enrolled him in any programs.  He should not just be sitting at home. There are places like Goodwill and other places that will train him in a job.  Your parents are neglecting him.  Are you expected to care for him when they can\u2019t? You need to sit with them and have a frank discussion about his further with them.  If you do not want to be his carer you need to make that clear to them.

Have you ever set firm boundaries and does he understand consequences? Responsibility of that nature?", "NTA.\nNot your responsibility. You two decided together and he didn't enroll as he said he would. You agree to buy him a computer and he wanted one more expensive. Still you delivered and got nothing for it.\n\nIf your parents say he needs a new one, they can buy him one instead of guilt trip you into making him happy.", "NTA\nLet your parents foot the bill repeatedly for a new computer. I don't mean to pry but, doesn't your brother get money from the state or federal gov. for being disabled? Perhaps he could use that money to buy his own computer. Good luck.", "NTA.  You aren't obligated to buy him expensive toys because he wants them, no matter what his mental health situation is.  I am curious as to whether you have ever spoken with him about any of this.  As it stands, he's basically being rewarded for goofing off all day, and he seems to think that he's entitled to a new computer because he broke the old one.  Now, it may be that it is simply so hard to be him that he can't do much more.  (I am not being sarcastic or snide.  Some people have to spend so much energy just trying to craft their mental world into some semblance of order that they just don't have the bandwidth for much more.)  If that's where he is, you still don't owe him anything, but a conversation wouldn't do any good, and will just make him feel bad.  But I'm getting a whiff of the idea that he's being enabled by your parents, and that they would like you to join in even more than you already have. If he's capable of being more functional and independent, even just the idea that he isn't \\*entitled\\* to an expensive luxury, then having a conversation with him about his responsibility in all this -- the fact that he never used the computer for its intended purpose, and on top of that he now expects another one because he fried the last one might be worth it for both of you.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t your parents buy him one? It\u2019s not your responsibility to buy him a computer.", "NTA tell your brother your parents agreed to buy him his laptop and then leave.\nLet them handle the shit show.", "Why? He's not your child.", "Actually a really good tablet is about 300 - less than a smartphone. A 10-15$ bluetooth keyboard & I\u2019d be willing to bet he could get through basic college courses with that.\n\nFundamentally though OP needs to change the dynamic. Just because I can afford a house, does not mean i should buy my sister a house. Parents have expectations of OP which are over-reaching", "NTA. If you did choose to help maybe he can do something to \u201cearn\u201d a new computer.
