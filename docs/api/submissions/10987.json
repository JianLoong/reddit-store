And you\u2019re right, if you buy him another one it\u2019s something that not only he will expect, but also your parents and the expectation of caring for him will never end.

Mental illness is just that, a mental illness.  It does not mean someone cannot have minimal responsibilities or that they cannot contribute inside or outside of the home.  It does not mean there cannot (or that there should not) be ground rules or structures or consequences in place for that person.  \n\n\nYou were kind and supportive to buy your brother that computer.  He never enrolled or pursued classes, but you were just glad he was happy.  It\u2019s NOT your problem that he was irresponsible and damaged his computer.

That surely doesn\u2019t help your brother at all, and it will put you on the endless hook.", "NTA!\n\nNot only did he lie but he is *expecting* you to get him a new one.

You bought him a gift and he broke it.  Your responsibility ends there.  Although if it was something that brought him a lot of joy and your parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy him one I probably would buy him one if he\u2019s unable to earn money himself.  You aren\u2019t obligated to do so though.  If he has a way to earn money he would be better offer saving up for it himself.  He will be less likely to break it in the future.", "NTA.

I'm hoping it's something significant because if you say it's anxiety or something similar, that's  the cop out that people use. You're not the a****** and you don't need to buy him a new computer. He gets on his two feet and buy himself a computer.", "why dont your parents buy it for him? is he still even in school ?\n\nNTA while he is your brother, his mental illness is not your responsibilty, if anyones, its your parents.", "Info - so many questions:\n\nWhy did his computer die? Mechanical failure, intentional or negligent mistreatment, viruses, power surges, or what? Can it be repaired? Will it keep happening?\n\nIf you go ahead and buy him a $200-$300 computer, will it last or will it suddenly die because he prefers another $650 computer? \n\nIf your parents are simply expecting you to supply his needs because you were told to do so, does this mean that no provisions are being made for his care after your parents are no longer able to do so because they decided you would be taking over? \n\nIs there any treatment or care available for his condition that he is not getting?

I think I\u2019d probably buy the computer. You say he uses it for a social aspect and I\u2019d be concerned about what the lack that ability would do. I also think I would sit down my parents and dial in why they think it\u2019s my responsibility to do this.", "NTA - you bought it as a part of a bigger thing that he never took advantage of. If your brother is disabled, doesn't he have income from social security disability? If so, why can't they use some of that money to replace his computer? Also, no one replaces gifts when they break, that's just unheard of.\n\nIf you want to be nice, wait until xmas or his birthday and buy the cheaper one. I wouldn't just make it a random gift. It also wouldn't hurt to take the laptop to a repair shop to see if it just needs a new motherboard or something.\n\nLastly, what about buying a used computer that your parents pitch in to help pay for?", "nta \n\nIt's my understanding that with serious mental illness he should be getting disability \n\nHe can save up his own spare money to either purchase a new computer or put towards his parents helping him get one. \n\nYou bought him a gift. A one off gift. There is no requirement to replace what is broken.", "NTA. I\u2019m physically disabled and am on SSDI. My check isn\u2019t much more than what someone would get if they were on SSI. Which I assume your brother is on or he\u2019s on SSDI based on your parents SSA account since he was disabled before the age of 22 which could mean his check is a lot higher than mine (if y\u2019all don\u2019t have him on any benefits then y\u2019all are really screwing around and would definitely be T A H). So with all this background on my benefits, I save up to get myself anything extra I might want. I\u2019ve gotten myself a nice laptop (less than 300 on amazon) and even saved up to get myself a PS5. I do have a couple credit cards but they are only for medical expenses only as I sometimes have to travel to 10 hours away for appointments and am using them that way to build my credit back up after medical debt destroyed my credit while applying for disability.", "NTA. Get him to apply for a library card. He can use the computers for free there.", "NTA whatever you decide. Do whatever you choose to do because you want to, not because it is expected or not. You have no obligation, it's simply what you want to give.", "NTA. You bought him one for school and it's obvious he's not going to school nor does he seem interested. You tried. If your parents want to help him, that's their business but they are also being unreasonable expecting you to supply your brother with a  new one.", "NTA why can't he buy it himself? He should be getting disability. It sounds like your parents are fleecing you.", "They say they support him in myriad other ways, and they feel this is how I should show my support.", "No idea why the computer died. I know he used it constantly. He said it's not repairable, and I am just going on his word, because I know nothing. I should really take it in to a professional. I don't know why I didn't think of that.\n\nIt is expected that when my parents are unable/no long here, that I will take care of him.   They have some money set aside for him, but I'm supposed to dole it out to him so that it lasts. \n\nI've tried to set him up with the county vocational program, but he won't go and he becomes aggressive when they call or come over. He is incredibly smart and there is so much he could do with himself, but his behavior gets in the way.", "He has schizophrenia. He is genuinely very ill.", "I think as long as he doesn't use a computer for coursework, a cheap tablet is plenty.\n\nNTA. Tell him it has to last X years.", "You already did. You gave him a good laptop, and he ruined it in less than two years. Or are you going to be expected to buy one every year whenever he destroys it? No.", "NTA.  He is an adult which means the list of people obligated to support him starts and ends with him, and in extraordinary circumstances, his PARENTS.", "Well i you are definetly not an asshole for that but also not exacly innocent too. You changed his way of living when you bought him the computer even if you didnt meant this way but still it was you started all of this. \u0130 am not saying  have to buy it but if 200-300 $ isnt that much of a money to you, i think you should buy i mean its family right. But if its a big amount well you dont have to spend that money just to entertain him \n\nAlso if you buy it again they will expect you to buy a computer every now and then. \nWhat i can i advise you is this: if you want to buy a conputer for him just give the money to your parents and tell them to buy it instead of you and let them tell ita from them not you. So next time he friea the computer, he will not expect you to buy again", "Nta", "NTA Buy him a chromebooknwith the google opwrating system. The operating system doesn't work with most gaming services, so he would only be able to use the browser. So it would still be useful for basic functions.", "NTA however I do have to ask, if he has a disability that prevents him from working, what's the point in going to college?", "NTA.  It's one thing if you had told him you would get him one, talked up how great it was, then didn't.  You would be mean.  But you bought him the computer and he didn't follow through with his end of going to college.  Maybe had he gone to college and the original computer broke and he needs it for classes or he was able to work with the computer and create things with it, something more than it being a toy, OP might feel differently about getting him another one.  But it's a toy that he broke.  If he wants another, he should figure out how to go about doing that.  Or his parents should figure it out.  It isn't OP responsibility.", "NTA if they want him to have a computer so badly they can buy it", "But he\u2019s their son, regardless of age, they made him exist in the world and they bear the responsibility for him. For most people that responsibility can legally end at 18, but if it can\u2019t, he remains their responsibility. He is not, was not, and never has been your responsibility. In fact unless you choose to take on the responsibility for him in the future, he never will be your responsibility, your parents will have to set up and provide for appropriate care measures for after they die. If you haven\u2019t had this conversation with them yet, I\u2019d suggest you do so they can prepare.", "You are not obliged to support him.  He is your sibling, not your child.", "Well, ya know, he's their kid. It's not up to you to support him."]}
