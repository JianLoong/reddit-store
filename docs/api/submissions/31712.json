Medical neglect is a crime, not a medical diagnosis. I\u2019m diagnosing the parents as assholes, which I am qualified to do.\n\nYou are practicing medicine without a license by declaring a surgery unnecessary based on the Reddit statements of neglectful parents.", "Oh for sure, for some families that is a big expense. Definitely cheaper than surgery though.", "Oh for sure, I realize every case is different and am no expert. Still I think it is reasonable to believe it is cheaper than surgery as an adult.", "for sure!! my mum tried her best but in the end i would just take \u2018em off as soon as i got to school lol. still, no excuse for not trying at all\u2026OP should\u2019ve atleast given it a go", "That's.... Literally a medical problem.", "If your feet hurt too much to even *stand* and you might need surgery then it's absolutely a medical problem.", "You type that out and don't see a problem?", "You have literally described a medical problem. This can be corrected via braces, special footwear, physical therapy, and/or surgery. You can pretend it\u2019s not a medical problem and live in discomfort until you die, or you can ask around and see what\u2019s to be done to make your life better.", "Who told you that wasn't a legitimate medical issue? Whoever did, did not have your best interests at heart (or were talking out of their ass) If it affects your ability to walk or stand, it's a medical problem. And flat feet can fuck up your spine. Literally.", "Did you miss the oart where they're also pigeon toed?", "how is that not a medical problem", "Yep always someone else\u2019s fault!", "You don\u2019t actually know if that is true.", "Yes, her parents are at fault for medically neglecting her. That's how this works."]}
