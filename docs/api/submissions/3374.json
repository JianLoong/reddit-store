Little did I know that when my mother picked me up from the airport, my ex-stepfather (my mother was married to this man and divorced years ago, and are now back together) was there in the car as a \"surprise\" from my mother.\n\nA little context for this man though. He made my life a living hell growing up and was very controlling of me and my brother. He would not be supportive of anything my brother and I did and would gaslight us consistently. My mother is lonely where she lives now, and she really wanted someone to be with which is why they amended and got back together, but did not remarry. \n\nSo, Friday, I had to work on some crucial work-related things that came up out of nowhere, and I was on my laptop in my room finishing those things up. My mother called me to dinner and I asked her to give me a few minutes because I needed to finish my train of thought with this email I was sending. My mother's boyfriend then opened the door and said it's time to eat *now* and I asked him to give me a few minutes. He then proceeded to turn off my laptop and I stopped him to the point where it didn't just shut down automatically, but it still shutdown and I lost my email I was typing up along with some other work files that were still open (I was able to salvage a little bit of it).\n\nHe and I got into a verbal altercation and I said that he doesn't control me anymore and that he is completely out of line for shutting down my laptop, to which he said this is his and my mother's household and it's their rules. I got so irritated to the point where I said to the both of them that I would be changing my flight to later today and that once I am treated like I am an adult and not a teenager, I would come back for Christmas, so that's exactly what I did. I got a later flight, Ubered there, and left for home early.\n\nI've been doing some self-care things the past two days to take my mind off of what happened because my mother was so upset when I left early. But, instead of thoroughly enjoying my time off, I was left with the \"surprise\" of my mother's boyfriend being there, and still controlling me even eight years after he and my mother divorced. I love my mother, but there is no way I am putting up with behavior like that from her boyfriend (even if her boyfriend keeps her company and makes her happy).

You are an adult and he doesn\u2019t get to control you anymore. I\u2019m so sorry for this, and that your mum isn\u2019t strong enough to stand up to him. He sounds like a classic bully and for your sake, you may need to stay away", "NTA.  Your ex-Stepfather definitely is.  \n\nBut, I will add that maybe not a good idea to be around him at Christmas, or any other time, come to that.", "NTA for leaving. Now that you've had some time yo think about it, you need to talk with your mom privately without him on the line. Tell her you felt ambushed not knowing he would be there, that he is not your parent and while you know she wants his company,  you do not want a relationship with him. Arrange to see her without him.", "NTA.  And there's no way you should believe things will be better in a month.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother also seems a bit spineless but yeah fuck this guy.", "Wow, OP. I'm sorry that your mother's AH boyfriend totally ruined the holiday. You didn't deserve that, and you are correct. Skip those toxic holidays until they are willing to treat you like an adult and a guest. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a fricken adult. This guy is absolutely controlling\u2026", "NTA\n\nGood for you for drawing boundaries and sticking to them.\n\nYour sf sounds like a controlling AH. Your mother should not complain, since she decided to spring this AH on you with no warning.", "NTA\n\nTime to go no contact.", "NTA, not at all.  Make other plans for Christmas.", "NTA!  You were literally WORKING!  He sounds awful!", "NTA. you're moms bf was wayyyy out of line.", "NTA - It\u2019s nice to see someone properly standing up for themselves as you did. I think most people can agree that your ex-stepfather is the AH here. I just hope that guy is treating your Mom well. Maybe in a few days, have a conversation with your Mom and make sure everything is ok with her.", "NTA. You\u2019re 30 for fuck\u2019s sake, he has no legs to stand on with treating you like you\u2019re a child. He\u2019s just a controlling asshole and you don\u2019t have to put up with it. Just be firm with your mom that if she wants to see you, she needs to put that jerk in his place about treating you like an adult. But she\u2019s really shady for not telling you he was going to be there.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult and you did nothing wrong. He had no right to do that to you it doesn\u2019t matter if they were together before. You protected your self care and it\u2019s totally okay to do. Mom has to understand that.", "NTA. History says nothing will improve. You\u2019re not obligated to like this man who is, at best, dismissive of you and at worst, emotionally abusive.\n\nTell your mom how you feel and that, while you want to spend time with her, their relationship is problematic and not good for your mental health. Offer to see her without him around.", "NTA. Your mom needs to step up and tell bf this is not appropriate. If she doesn't then you know you have to keep your mom at arms length due to the bf.", "NTA\n\nWhat an awful Thanksgiving surprise. Not only are they back together but living together? Ugh.\n\nYou can see your mom and support her not being lonely I think without spending much time with him. If the history is as awful as you say I definitely wouldn\u2019t stay there again. Maybe get a hotel if you decide to visit? \n\nHe was completely out of line for sure. Did he know you were working and not just playing a game or something? Not that this is a defense for his actions but I\u2019m curious. FFS you are 30 years old.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you a bit and would be unlikely to ever stay there again as long as he lives with her. \n\nPerhaps she can come visit you?", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to protect yourself from bullies. This is not a situation where he doesn't know better and is in the process of learning - this is a grown man trying to impose his choices on another adult and their belongings.\n\nYour mother can't be so blind as to not realize how badly he treated you and your brother. This was not a \"surprise\", it was an ambush where she hoped it would be too late for you to change your mind when you found out. If she keeps on behaving that way, you may have to interact with her much less. \n\nCan you visit her but get a hotel room nearby? That way you are in control of your environment and always have a safe place to go when he starts acting up. Can she come visit you either at the hotel or where you live without him? Might she consider relocating to a less remote location so she can make friends that aren't bullies?\n\nGood luck", "Christ, what an asshole. Not you. You are an adult, with a job and responsibilities. Taking a few minutes to handle an imperative work thing did not warrant that response from your mom's partner. NTA", "NTA. I'd tell mother that she's made a choice that means I won't be there for Christmas. Don't go back to that abusive household until he is gone again.", "Nta", "NTA. Your step father\u2019s actions were beyond reproach. He is still the narcissistic, gas-lighting AH he was when you were young. I\u2019m so sorry this man has reentered your mother\u2019s, and by connection your, life. You handled the situation beautifully. Good for you, for creating boundaries. Moving forward, have your mother come visit you, instead of the other way around. \nOn another note, I truly hope your mother is ok. People like him are difficult to shake, once you\u2019ve let them into your life.", "NTA\nBut it's important to note, for your own mental health, that he wasn't controlling you. He was *trying* to control you and you weren't having it. Go you!\nWhat you did here was set a clear boundary of how you will not be treated. It's up to your mother to decide if she's going to ensure that her boyfriend respects those boundaries if you're to visit. This is now up to her, not you.", "NTA - You are a full grown adult who was taking a few moments to finish a task for work, and he treated you like a child (not that a child should be treated that badly, either).  And of course he immediately calls it \"his household\" after moving in with your mother.  Even if he was a complete stranger, this behavior would be unacceptable, but with your history together, it's completely understandable that you did not want to be around him.  \n\nI'm sorry that you are having to deal with this, I imagine it will strain things between you and your mother going forward.  For whatever reason, she'd rather be with this controlling ass than alone (even though I'm sure there are far better men out there).  You can decide how much of a relationship you want with her, and how much you are willing to deal with.  If she is willing to visit you without him, it could still work, but it's possible that someone that controlling won't let her go anywhere alone.  I hope things work out, but you don't have to subject yourself to him for her sake.", "NTA. He is toxic and your mother may have to come to term with the fact that you may never have holiday at hers. Maybe you can arrange for her to come to yours without him.", "Nta...he really tried it and thought he could play parent....messed around and found out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP is not the parent and this woman is a grown-ass adult.", "I agree, but that's probably what the stepdad wants. To isolate his partner so he can abuse her, with a reduced risk of her fleeing to family or friends.\n\nHe sounds quite abusive and controlling. I hope OP's mum leaves him before it's too late. Maybe some though love from her family will be the push she needs, maybe not. However, OP should not subject herself to abuse because of his mum's choices.", "Good point. Maybe trying to keep contact with mum, but insisting that at no point is boyf to be included in that contact.", "Yes, alienating the victims from their family and friends is the first step in the \"abusers manual\".", "NTA - you are an adult and are no required to deal with his shit ever again. He has a weird need to show dominance and you did what you should have done, just left.\n\nI will say as a mom I am appalled at your's for letting that man back into her life and thinking it would be a good 'surprise' for you. I don't care how lonely I am, that is a non-negotiable. Absolutely not.\n\nFrom now on tell your mom if she wants to see you she can come to you, alone, but that you will not be around him ever again.", "NTA. A good run beats a bad stand every time. You're a grown man, taking care of business. Mom's boyfriend was WAAAAY out of line, and you did the wise thing by leaving,  instead of throat punching BF for messing up your work.

Do not engage and do not go anywhere near this toxic AH or your mom over the holidays as she cannot be trusted to keep your interests or well being at heart.", "Dude...the fact that you said you'd come crawling back at Christmas if they gave you some lip service apology just lost you what little respect you might have gained from leaving. \n\nNTA", "You are definitely NTA. He was completely out of line. He is a control freak and he will only use and disappoint your mother. I wouldn't rush into rescue her cause she is an adult and we all need to learn sometimes. He's an idiot to treat a grown man like that. He'll I wouldn't even treat a child like that because I believe in respecting everyone and what the big deal to give someone a few minutes to take care of business.  It's his way of driving a wedge between you and your mother.", "NTA but your mothers boyfriend is. Did your mother ever stand up for you ever in your life. It doesn\u2019t sound like it.
