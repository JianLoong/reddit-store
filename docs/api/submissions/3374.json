He made my life a living hell growing up and was very controlling of me and my brother. He would not be supportive of anything my brother and I did and would gaslight us consistently.

You are an adult and he doesn\u2019t get to control you anymore. I\u2019m so sorry for this, and that your mum isn\u2019t strong enough to stand up to him. He sounds like a classic bully and for your sake, you may need to stay away", "NTA.  Your ex-Stepfather definitely is.  \n\nBut, I will add that maybe not a good idea to be around him at Christmas, or any other time, come to that.", "NTA for leaving. Now that you've had some time yo think about it, you need to talk with your mom privately without him on the line. Tell her you felt ambushed not knowing he would be there, that he is not your parent and while you know she wants his company,  you do not want a relationship with him. Arrange to see her without him.", "NTA.  And there's no way you should believe things will be better in a month.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother also seems a bit spineless but yeah fuck this guy.", "Wow, OP. I'm sorry that your mother's AH boyfriend totally ruined the holiday. You didn't deserve that, and you are correct. Skip those toxic holidays until they are willing to treat you like an adult and a guest. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a fricken adult. This guy is absolutely controlling\u2026", "NTA\n\nGood for you for drawing boundaries and sticking to them.\n\nYour sf sounds like a controlling AH. Your mother should not complain, since she decided to spring this AH on you with no warning.", "NTA\n\nTime to go no contact.", "NTA, not at all.  Make other plans for Christmas.", "NTA!  You were literally WORKING!  He sounds awful!", "NTA. you're moms bf was wayyyy out of line.", "NTA - It\u2019s nice to see someone properly standing up for themselves as you did. I think most people can agree that your ex-stepfather is the AH here. I just hope that guy is treating your Mom well. Maybe in a few days, have a conversation with your Mom and make sure everything is ok with her.", "NTA. You\u2019re 30 for fuck\u2019s sake, he has no legs to stand on with treating you like you\u2019re a child. He\u2019s just a controlling asshole and you don\u2019t have to put up with it. Just be firm with your mom that if she wants to see you, she needs to put that jerk in his place about treating you like an adult. But she\u2019s really shady for not telling you he was going to be there.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult and you did nothing wrong. He had no right to do that to you it doesn\u2019t matter if they were together before. You protected your self care and it\u2019s totally okay to do. Mom has to understand that.", "NTA. History says nothing will improve. You\u2019re not obligated to like this man who is, at best, dismissive of you and at worst, emotionally abusive.\n\nTell your mom how you feel and that, while you want to spend time with her, their relationship is problematic and not good for your mental health. Offer to see her without him around.", "NTA. Your mom needs to step up and tell bf this is not appropriate. If she doesn't then you know you have to keep your mom at arms length due to the bf.", "NTA\n\nWhat an awful Thanksgiving surprise. Not only are they back together but living together? Ugh.\n\nYou can see your mom and support her not being lonely I think without spending much time with him. If the history is as awful as you say I definitely wouldn\u2019t stay there again. Maybe get a hotel if you decide to visit? \n\nHe was completely out of line for sure. Did he know you were working and not just playing a game or something? Not that this is a defense for his actions but I\u2019m curious. FFS you are 30 years old.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you a bit and would be unlikely to ever stay there again as long as he lives with her. \n\nPerhaps she can come visit you?", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to protect yourself from bullies. This is not a situation where he doesn't know better and is in the process of learning - this is a grown man trying to impose his choices on another adult and their belongings.\n\nYour mother can't be so blind as to not realize how badly he treated you and your brother. This was not a \"surprise\", it was an ambush where she hoped it would be too late for you to change your mind when you found out. If she keeps on behaving that way, you may have to interact with her much less. \n\nCan you visit her but get a hotel room nearby? That way you are in control of your environment and always have a safe place to go when he starts acting up. Can she come visit you either at the hotel or where you live without him? Might she consider relocating to a less remote location so she can make friends that aren't bullies?\n\nGood luck", "Christ, what an asshole. Not you. You are an adult, with a job and responsibilities. Taking a few minutes to handle an imperative work thing did not warrant that response from your mom's partner. NTA", "NTA. I'd tell mother that she's made a choice that means I won't be there for Christmas. Don't go back to that abusive household until he is gone again.", "Nta", "NTA. Your step father\u2019s actions were beyond reproach. He is still the narcissistic, gas-lighting AH he was when you were young. I\u2019m so sorry this man has reentered your mother\u2019s, and by connection your, life. You handled the situation beautifully. Good for you, for creating boundaries. Moving forward, have your mother come visit you, instead of the other way around. \nOn another note, I truly hope your mother is ok. People like him are difficult to shake, once you\u2019ve let them into your life.", "NTA\nBut it's important to note, for your own mental health, that he wasn't controlling you. He was *trying* to control you and you weren't having it. Go you!\nWhat you did here was set a clear boundary of how you will not be treated. It's up to your mother to decide if she's going to ensure that her boyfriend respects those boundaries if you're to visit. This is now up to her, not you.", "NTA - You are a full grown adult who was taking a few moments to finish a task for work, and he treated you like a child (not that a child should be treated that badly, either).  And of course he immediately calls it \"his household\" after moving in with your mother.  Even if he was a complete stranger, this behavior would be unacceptable, but with your history together, it's completely understandable that you did not want to be around him.  \n\nI'm sorry that you are having to deal with this, I imagine it will strain things between you and your mother going forward.  For whatever reason, she'd rather be with this controlling ass than alone (even though I'm sure there are far better men out there).  You can decide how much of a relationship you want with her, and how much you are willing to deal with.  If she is willing to visit you without him, it could still work, but it's possible that someone that controlling won't let her go anywhere alone.  I hope things work out, but you don't have to subject yourself to him for her sake.", "NTA. He is toxic and your mother may have to come to term with the fact that you may never have holiday at hers. Maybe you can arrange for her to come to yours without him.", "Nta...he really tried it and thought he could play parent....messed around and found out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
