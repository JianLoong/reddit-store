(I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called) are stuffed animals. She collects hundreds. But her favorites are these bunnies made to represent emotions. (Think edgy care bears)\n\nShe\u2019s told me multiple times to never hurt or take away her stuffed animals. (An ex would take them away from her as punishment) I\u2019d never dream of causing harm to something so important to her.\n\nHer favorite bunny (the angry one) has gone missing. I knew she was attached to her stuffed animals, but ever since she realized he\u2019s gone, she\u2019s been going off the walls. She can\u2019t sleep and spends hours searching for him every day. If she does sleep, it\u2019s because she cried herself out. She hasn\u2019t been doing her online classes because she\u2019s been spending so much time searching every part of her entire house. It\u2019s basically consumed her entire life for the past week almost.\n\nWhile I was FaceTiming her last night, I said that she should check by her nightstand for her bunny. She asked me why, and I told her that I saw him fall there before we left to go to my house last Saturday.\n\nAfter hearing that, she became distraught and started saying that it\u2019s my fault her bunny is gone. In her mind, I watched him fall to his death and did nothing.\n\nI know her stuffed animals are important to her, but we were on our way out the door and I thought nothing of it. I didn\u2019t even remember that I saw him fall until last night.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Please stop telling me to leave her over this. She is an amazing woman and is incredibly deep, intelligent, and thoughtful. Yes, she has some eccentric tendencies and is very attached to her stuffed animals. But I love seeing how happy they make her.\n\n\nEdit 2: No, the bunny has not been found yet.\n\nEdit 3: My girlfriend does see people for her mental health. She\u2019s currently between therapists and hasn\u2019t been given a new one yet. I\u2019m sure being without her therapy right now isn\u2019t helping her situation\n\nEdit 4: Goddamn some of y\u2019all are vile. Just because my girlfriend is autistic does not make her stupid, a child, or a burden. Yes, she doesn\u2019t always behave in a way that is 100% age appropriate. Normally this is in times of distress. Saying that my girlfriend is unworthy of love or romantic relationships because of her autism is fucking disgusting. Take your ableism elsewhere.\n\nEdit 5: Yes, I can buy her a new bunny. But her specific bunny is very special to her because it was given to her by a close friend. And I\u2019m almost 100% certain she\u2019d know the replacement is an impostor if I tried to hide that.", "created_utc": 1675967785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y2aqd/aita_for_disappearing_my_girlfriends_stuffed/", "score": 390, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make sure she knows that you now understand all the furry friends must stay on the bed. Just be open and honest. That's also a tip for the future if you continue to be with her.

Because losing something you hold precious regardless of your age, is super impactful. Now her reaction to you on the phone is a direct result of her being so emotionally distraught. All you can do is be there for her and offer to assist her in any way you can. She may not want your help and you have to be ok with this situation, as it is right now. \n\nMaybe later on, she\u2019ll be able to have a better discussion with you. In that way she can open up to about her feelings and explain to you how she felt were you both and get a better understanding. If she can find the stuff bunny, she\u2019ll likely will feel different than she is feeling currently. You got her at the height of emotions, height of adrenaline, and she likely does not feel that way about you (what she said).\n\nNow, onto her austism. Having that stuff animal present and where she knew it was and where she\u2019s able to reach for it and touch it and hold it and smell it and feel it\u2026 Does so much for her well-being. As you may have noticed, or may have not, people who have autism tend to interact with their environment differently than a person without autism. And this is all encompassing, her entire environment. Perhaps you should take this opportunity to ask her more questions about her autism and her experiences, and educate yourself. There\u2019s plenty of online resources. I say this from a person who\u2019s worked with people with autism, both in an educational setting, and in a mental health clinical setting, while there are similarities and commonalities seen with people who have autism each person is unique in and with their autism. Autism is a spectrum. That means your girlfriend could experience any aspect of autism at any degree., Let me explain this better. For example, while your girlfriend may have ease with social interactions and social cues her need for her stuffed animal is very great. Because of what that stuff animal provide to her. Another person with autism may be opposite of her or may be very different of her. It\u2019s a beautiful Spectrum, but it\u2019s a spectrum so you do yourself and her disservice not learning more about the person that you love. \nHonestly, this seems like an honest mistake, and now that you know this about your girlfriend, you will behave differently in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s not a right or wrong here.

Some of you should be truly ashamed of your selves for spouting such sh*t\n\nI'm autistic my self and our special interests are ingrained in us they're our safe space because we can always focus on them when we're overwhelmed having sensory issues etc. The fact that her ex used to take them away as \"punishment\" has also effected her massively as it causes panic and makes her freak out because it's the fear that something that is so important to us could be taken away.  We don't do well with change,  so her knowing that her favourite has gone is a huge change for her and will become her focus until she finds them. It causes genuine panic and fear in us.

If she blames you for everything then sure it's a red flag but based on your comments it doesn't seem that way. \n\nOnce she is in a less emotional state I think she owes you an apology for reacting so strongly and will hopefully understand you forgot you saw it fall. To those saying ' no way you just remembered ' people don't remember everything they see straight away, especially if they don't have an emotional bond with an item. \n\nCould a family member help her look for the bunny ? Also once this is sorted maybe you could both  come up with a plan in case something like this happens again?\n\nLast thing I'd like to say is having an attachment like this to stuffies does not make your girlfriend a child or have a child-like mind.

She lives with her parents because she\u2019s physically disabled, in school, and cannot safely live alone due to her health issues. \n\nHer fingerprint lock is there because she gets incredibly paranoid and needs security to sleep.", "Then you of all people should know not to make comments about someone's mental capacity. We're getting a shorthand version of events and you are in no place to judge someone's mental capacity.", "I can buy her another, but she\u2019d know he\u2019s an impostor. Her specific bunny was given to her by a friend and is very special to her.", "Maybe get a new one and give it a little \"Substitute\" badge, so she still has access to the angry bunny if needed, but you're showing you aren't replacing it, just substituting until the original is found?", "So you said you saw it fall by the nightstand, but it wasn't there?? You mentioned seeing the bunny fall, but did not mention seeing that in the moment so it wasn't helpful. Did you verify the bunny was still gone from where you last saw it?", "I say, start organizing a search party with all the other bunnies. Start interviewing the other bunnies. See if there was a grudge. The Angry bunny was last seen falling off the nightstand but at the same time, was Angry bunny pushed? You only saw it but who knows if other agents were next to the nightstand willing to kidnap a vulnerable bunny? The first 48 hours are the most critical.", "[deleted]", "Spouse/ Significant other is always considered a suspect when stuff like this goes down...", "That\u2019s rough. I\u2019m sorry. I just left a judgment it\u2019s probably at the very end of all of the comments. Some of these comments are brutal. Just remember that not everyone knows the isms of being on the spectrum and where this is nothing for one person it is something to your person.", "Given how stressed she is, perhaps you could test at home to ensure you're testing negative (which means you're not shedding a lot of virus and have a low likelihood of being contagious), then go over wearing a mask and have her open the windows just before you get there.  That will keep the COVID transmission risk miniscule and give you a chance to help find the bunny.", "Me constantly with sunglasses. Have a real nice expensive pair and two dozen cheap ones because that happens regularly to me. Fiancee finds it weird I randomly disappear to the truck or garage only to return wearing the spendy pair a few minutes later.( Usually at midnight while watching a movie or before bed)", ">Disgusting way of thinking, I hope you never have a~~n autistic~~ child\n\nThere. Fixed it for you.", "have you been over to help her look? it might be that she's so upset that a fresh pair of eyes would have a better time finding it", "Just a thought- if it\u2019s small enough, tell her to check if it got mixed up with her laundry", "Some of the people on here are convinced OP's being malicious and purposefully witholding stuff from GF but it really isn't the case at all? Like you can remember random shit 3 days from now just because it popped in your head, I do it, my mom does it, everyone I've met does it so it just sounds like a mini ''oh I think I remember seeing it!'' moment and people are having beef because OP forgot.", "Oh yeah, don't replace angry bunny.\n\nAnd she probably *will* know. They acquire pilling or small stains or any number of identifying markers, so she'd know, lol.\n\nI just meant like... it shouldn't be a \"I'm sorry that angry bunny is missing\" but more of a \"I'm sorry I scared you by saying 'fall'.\" or... whatever it is. The first might feel replacement-y. The second makes it less so :P", "I saw in another comment you mentioned her family - so she lives with them? I would bet they have something to do with it. Ignore the replies blaming you. Hope she finds her buddy!", "To quote Dazai's No Longer Human: \"Everything passes\". I think it will be a good thing to reflect on this event with her after emotions settle down. In the meantime, perhaps you can take some solace in the fact you come across as a really nice guy/boyfriend, and I'm sure your girlfriend feels the same way.", "I am strongly attached to my wedding ring but I wouldn't react this way because I have control over emotions. How about this, she has the emotional maturity of a child and she has autism. The former holds true for someone reacting this way without autism, and autism doesn't magically negate that fact.", "Firstly, I'm sure that there isn't one way to respond with Autism.  Part of its manifestation.  Secondly, we don't have to shirk the reality of it.  It's valid to draw parallels.  I recognize that those with autism have their own set of neural pathways that differentiate them from a child, yet, at the same time, it is perfectly valid to point out that someone is acting like a child regardless of their reason for doing so.  I don't intend \"like a child\" to be necessarily pejorative, though I'm taking from your responses as you see it as such, and perhaps this is a criticism that the autism community is sensitive to, so I'll try to word it better next time.  That said, I stand behind the idea that the original poster is trying to have a mature relationship with someone who may not be capable of it, and I question whether that is healthy for either of them.  My criticism is not really of her.  It's more for him.", "Except you didn't remember, did you?  Because the rabbit wasn't there.\n\nIt's not a real rabbit - it didn't hop away on its own.  So, either you're lying about seeing the rabbit fall or you're lying about doing something to the rabbit or knowing of its whereabouts.", "[deleted]", "She\u2019s still very upset and keeps texting me every few hours that she misses him/can\u2019t find him, so I\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t where I saw him", "[deleted]", "I can\u2019t help her look right now without risking covid exposure for her and her family.", "That\u2019s what it seemed like to me. As a very forgetful person, I was baffled.", "Her door has a fingerprint lock on it that only her and her mother can open. Her mom isn\u2019t in the business of stealing stuffed animals AFAIK.", "I adore your username.", "You\u2019re right, autism doesn\u2019t \u201cmagically\u201d do that. Because it\u2019s not magic. \n\nIt is, however, a neurotype. Your ignorance of what that means doesn\u2019t magically make your response any less ableist.", "You *used* it in a pejorative sense, regardless of whether you intended it that way. Indeed you continue to do so. \n\nDamn right the autistic community reacts badly to having a perfectly natural autistic reaction infantilised.", "What is with the accusations towards OP? This isn't Knives Out. I couldn't find my partner's meds this morning, then when they asked me again half an hour ago, I remembered that the meds are on my spouse's nightstand. It's literally completely normal for things like this to slip someone's mind or for someone to just not register that the other person wouldn't have looked in that spot yet. Relax.", "Jesus, are you the girlfriend?  It's a missing stuffed animal and you're acting like this is Law & Order.", "What are you, the plushie police? It\u2019s a stuffed rabbit. I couldn\u2019t even tell you if one of my wife\u2019s plushies went missing or the last time I saw it. There\u2019s a ton and they\u2019re everywhere so eventually you just don\u2019t even notice them", "Your aggression is fucking killing me lmfaoooo", "The bunny is still missing and she\u2019s still very distressed. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll turn up soon.", "Yes, a woman who found a way to turn her passions into a successful business that lets her live on her own schedule while studying for TWO degrees at once, and maintains a \u201cnormal\u201d job despite her physical limitations is more mature than me.", "Hey, have her check under her mattress. I have a special stuffed panda bear that I lost once. Spent weeks looking for him. Somehow he ended up squished between the mattress and bed frame. (Still no idea how)\n\nIf she has searched everywhere it may be time to start taking furniture apart to see if the bunny slid and is stuck in a really weird place.", "Did it tumble further under the bed perhaps?", "No, we did not.", "If someone without autism reacted like this, that would be a huge red flag. Just like somebody that continually lies is a huge red flag in a relationship. However, the liar could have a disorder that causes it just like she has autism. Neither can control it, but it doesn't make a red flag not a red flag. That's all I'm saying. The same goes with narcissists and all manner of disorders that are sadly out of the person's control.", "Just as I react to being told the sky isn't blue?  Try accepting what you are instead of tearing people down for making an imprecise parallel.  We're talking about a stuffed bunny.  You know who has emotional breakdowns over stuffed bunnies?  Children.\n\nQuote: \n\n\"she became distraught and started saying that it\u2019s my fault her bunny is  \n gone. In her mind, I watched him fall to his death and did nothing.\"\n\nHow much reality and disbelief is the original poster going to suspend?  And again, do you think that's healthy for either of them, especially given he felt compelled to share it on reddit?", "My point isn't that it's impossible to remember something minutes or days or weeks later.  Happens to me all the time.\n\nMy point was that if you say \"I remember your meds are on the nightstand\" and then they weren't on the nightstand...I guess you weren't really remembering anything then because what you \"remembered\" isn't actually what is.", "I just think he (and this post) is full of sh\\*\\*.  That's all.", "OP i had to scroll all the way to this comment before realizing that she didn't find the bunny behind the bed. You should edit your post to make that clear. NTA and i think at least some of the YTA voters have the same confusion I had", "[deleted]", "Not really, imo? I \"remember\" things are in the wrong place all the time. My spouse hasn't even checked the nightstand yet because they missed the time window to take their meds today, so maybe they'll turn out to be in the kitchen instead. If so, my brain probably just connected handing them their meds yesterday morning, setting their water down on the bedside table, and putting their meds wherever they *actually* are, ultimately conflating all those into one event (me supposedly putting their meds on the bedside table). Human memory is a ridiculously inaccurate and unreliable thing. I don't think you found a weak point in OP's Ace Attorney argument so much as a natural hiccup in the human brain.", "So now we\u2019re resorting to blatant ableism and slurs."]}
