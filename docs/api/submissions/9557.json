(I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called) are stuffed animals. She collects hundreds. But her favorites are these bunnies made to represent emotions. (Think edgy care bears)\n\nShe\u2019s told me multiple times to never hurt or take away her stuffed animals. (An ex would take them away from her as punishment) I\u2019d never dream of causing harm to something so important to her.\n\nHer favorite bunny (the angry one) has gone missing. I knew she was attached to her stuffed animals, but ever since she realized he\u2019s gone, she\u2019s been going off the walls. She can\u2019t sleep and spends hours searching for him every day. If she does sleep, it\u2019s because she cried herself out. She hasn\u2019t been doing her online classes because she\u2019s been spending so much time searching every part of her entire house. It\u2019s basically consumed her entire life for the past week almost.\n\nWhile I was FaceTiming her last night, I said that she should check by her nightstand for her bunny. She asked me why, and I told her that I saw him fall there before we left to go to my house last Saturday.\n\nAfter hearing that, she became distraught and started saying that it\u2019s my fault her bunny is gone. In her mind, I watched him fall to his death and did nothing.\n\nI know her stuffed animals are important to her, but we were on our way out the door and I thought nothing of it. I didn\u2019t even remember that I saw him fall until last night.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Please stop telling me to leave her over this. She is an amazing woman and is incredibly deep, intelligent, and thoughtful. Yes, she has some eccentric tendencies and is very attached to her stuffed animals. But I love seeing how happy they make her.\n\n\nEdit 2: No, the bunny has not been found yet.\n\nEdit 3: My girlfriend does see people for her mental health. She\u2019s currently between therapists and hasn\u2019t been given a new one yet. I\u2019m sure being without her therapy right now isn\u2019t helping her situation\n\nEdit 4: Goddamn some of y\u2019all are vile. Just because my girlfriend is autistic does not make her stupid, a child, or a burden. Yes, she doesn\u2019t always behave in a way that is 100% age appropriate. Normally this is in times of distress. Saying that my girlfriend is unworthy of love or romantic relationships because of her autism is fucking disgusting. Take your ableism elsewhere.\n\nEdit 5: Yes, I can buy her a new bunny. But her specific bunny is very special to her because it was given to her by a close friend. And I\u2019m almost 100% certain she\u2019d know the replacement is an impostor if I tried to hide that.", "created_utc": 1675967785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y2aqd/aita_for_disappearing_my_girlfriends_stuffed/", "score": 2349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make sure she knows that you now understand all the furry friends must stay on the bed. Just be open and honest. That's also a tip for the future if you continue to be with her.

Because losing something you hold precious regardless of your age, is super impactful. Now her reaction to you on the phone is a direct result of her being so emotionally distraught. All you can do is be there for her and offer to assist her in any way you can. She may not want your help and you have to be ok with this situation, as it is right now. \n\nMaybe later on, she\u2019ll be able to have a better discussion with you. In that way she can open up to about her feelings and explain to you how she felt were you both and get a better understanding. If she can find the stuff bunny, she\u2019ll likely will feel different than she is feeling currently. You got her at the height of emotions, height of adrenaline, and she likely does not feel that way about you (what she said).\n\nNow, onto her austism. Having that stuff animal present and where she knew it was and where she\u2019s able to reach for it and touch it and hold it and smell it and feel it\u2026 Does so much for her well-being. As you may have noticed, or may have not, people who have autism tend to interact with their environment differently than a person without autism. And this is all encompassing, her entire environment. Perhaps you should take this opportunity to ask her more questions about her autism and her experiences, and educate yourself. There\u2019s plenty of online resources. I say this from a person who\u2019s worked with people with autism, both in an educational setting, and in a mental health clinical setting, while there are similarities and commonalities seen with people who have autism each person is unique in and with their autism. Autism is a spectrum. That means your girlfriend could experience any aspect of autism at any degree., Let me explain this better. For example, while your girlfriend may have ease with social interactions and social cues her need for her stuffed animal is very great. Because of what that stuff animal provide to her. Another person with autism may be opposite of her or may be very different of her. It\u2019s a beautiful Spectrum, but it\u2019s a spectrum so you do yourself and her disservice not learning more about the person that you love. \nHonestly, this seems like an honest mistake, and now that you know this about your girlfriend, you will behave differently in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s not a right or wrong here.

Some of you should be truly ashamed of your selves for spouting such sh*t\n\nI'm autistic my self and our special interests are ingrained in us they're our safe space because we can always focus on them when we're overwhelmed having sensory issues etc. The fact that her ex used to take them away as \"punishment\" has also effected her massively as it causes panic and makes her freak out because it's the fear that something that is so important to us could be taken away.  We don't do well with change,  so her knowing that her favourite has gone is a huge change for her and will become her focus until she finds them. It causes genuine panic and fear in us.

If she blames you for everything then sure it's a red flag but based on your comments it doesn't seem that way. \n\nOnce she is in a less emotional state I think she owes you an apology for reacting so strongly and will hopefully understand you forgot you saw it fall. To those saying ' no way you just remembered ' people don't remember everything they see straight away, especially if they don't have an emotional bond with an item. \n\nCould a family member help her look for the bunny ? Also once this is sorted maybe you could both  come up with a plan in case something like this happens again?\n\nLast thing I'd like to say is having an attachment like this to stuffies does not make your girlfriend a child or have a child-like mind.

It isn't rational or reasonable to cry over a misplaced toy. It's even less reasonable for an adult to respond to misplacing a toy, no matter how beloved, by ceasing to be able to function normally.

Put everything that\u2019s on a shelf or a stack one-by-one on the table to make sure Bunny isn\u2019t hiding behind them. Once the spot is clear/checked, put an X of painter\u2019s tape where the boundaries of the search were, put the items back, and move to the next spot. \n\nYou can also use this method to empty out/off furniture like dressers, tables, and beds so you can look behind/under them. \n\nIn my experience shuffling everything around can kick up some dust, so take some Claritin and have a vacuum and dust rag ready. Happy Hunting!", "NTA. I\u2019m also Autistic and if one of my stuffies went missing, I\u2019d be pretty upset. So, thank you for supporting her. \n\nIt\u2019s also not your fault and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If you had a really taken the bunny my opinion would be different, but as is, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. You are very kind, thoughtful and empathic. Hopefully you or your girlfriend find the bunny soon. I think I know which line of stuffed bunnies you mean, are they the ones representing the mental disorders? Maybe you can also cheer her up a bit if you get her another one from the series. Not replacing the one she lost, that would not work indeed, but it would be very sweet to do so still", "NAH, and definitely nta. From your edits and comments, you sound like a very loving and caring BF. You're lucky to have each other.\n\nEdit, OH! And please update us when angry bunny is found!", "NAH - and you\u2019ve done so well to be understanding and caring \u2764\ufe0f \n\nThere sounds like some real trauma linked to your girlfriends previous relationship and her stuffed animals being taken away from her (which is SUCH a horrible thing for her ex to do) and it\u2019s likely her reaction to the missing bunny is linked to her ex taking them away previously / lying to her about them or downplaying her emotions. \n\nAll I can suggest is helping her look for the missing bunny (could it have got caught up in a blanket / under the mattress? This happened to me once with a cushion when making the bed) and maybe suggesting gifting her a replacement one if it doesn\u2019t turn up. Your help and suggestions to replace it might lower her worries that you (like her ex) are to blame.\n\nTo anyone judging OP\u2019s girlfriend - a lot of people dealing with trauma and a lot of people with neurodivergent conditions such as autism find comfort in plushies / stuffed animals / toys. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.", "My nephew is 22 and also on the spectrum. He lives in a group home but he\u2019s verbal. If one of his prized possessions went missing he would be the same. If you even move 1 object in his room he\u2019ll know and be pissed. NTA it\u2019s very difficult because I love my nephew very much. Just s as you do your GF. You sound like a good guy. Good luck", "You are the sweetest boyfriend and thank you for understanding she is autistic DEFINITELY not a burden. NTA", "NTA at all, you just suddenly remembered something and told her immediately. Also, from what I've read, you are an amazing boyfriend and you clearly care for her deeply.  I really hope she finds her bunny soon :)", "NTA because this isn\u2019t your fault. \n\nHowever, I completely understand her distress. Im autistic as well, and I have a special blanket. It\u2019s one of those blankets they wrap newborns in. I\u2019ve always had one and I need it to sleep. I freak out if it goes missing too, and tear apart my room to find it. I have a very hard time focusing on anything else until it\u2019s found.", "ESH. Don't conflate reasonable accommodations for her neurodivergvence with enabling immature behavior.", "I agree, it wasn't really very clear from the post that he didn't get rid of it. That may explain some of the negative comments.", "As an aside, 85% of autistic people with degrees in the US are unemployed. It's not unusual for certain aspects of ASD to interfere with employment. ASD is a disability for many, and that cannot be corrected through therapy. The only thing we can correct is the inhumane mindset that our value is determined based on our ability to work.\n\nNAH", "Oh god this about the change. Even positive changes that I WANT AND SOUGHT OUT make my autism go batshit crazy. Change is just an upsetting thing.", "I think it comes down to personal responsibility. Just because you were born with something that makes it harder to regulate and control your emotions, does not mean you are exempt from controlling those emotions. Your actions are still your choice. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), a mental illness, is predominately classified as \u201csudden episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts in which you react grossly out of proportion to the situation\u201d, literally including domestic abuse and other forms of assault. It is expected for someone with IED to physically hurt people. It\u2019s quite common. That however, by no means, excuses the actions. People deserve compassion, but to ignore or encourage all the harmful side effects of an illness or disorder in the name of \u201cinclusivity\u201d is dangerous. Educating yourself on the issue is important, as is treating people with compassion, but please do not downplay the side effects of mental health disorders because \u201cthat\u2019s just the way they are\u201d. They are disabled, not inhuman. Withholding any consequences from them helps no one.", "she\u2019s autistic??? how the fuck is that a red flag?", "that\u2019s rude", "i often will switch tasks in an effort to achieve this", "I'm autistic and while i don't have an interest as uncommon i get the feeling of being \"shamed\" for liking something so deeply, thankfully it's computers so it's less bad than if it were plushies. i do have a plushie I'm very attached to for reasons, and having my girlfriend be understandable of my uncommon attachments for objects like my PC or my teddy bear is just fantastic. props on you for being a great partner.", "I have a problem with anthropomorphizing things, although it's gotten better with age.   She has my sympathy.    I hope that the phone idea works.\n\nWhen you think that you can, I'd suggest clearing the room, putting things in a safe spot.   Have a checklist for the other stuffies.    Maybe show up with Substitute Angry Bunny - it seems to me that just when I replace something, the original reappears.   If it doesn't, at least she has the substitute and your loving concern.  \n\n Just please be very methodical - that's where I fall down by getting careless and creating chaos so that other things get lost.", "ND person here too, and I agree. NAH. She seems to be struggling to regulate. Something is out of place - something that is very important sentimentally AND a special interest is missing. She\u2019s distressed. I\u2019m sure she will be able to process once she finds her stuffie. OP can absolutely explain the mishap to her now, but she probably isn\u2019t in a place where she can receive that info.", "OP says his gf is receiving help to manage her mental health.", "I was going to recommend this as well. You\u2019re a good dude, OP, I hope Angry Bunny turns up soon, I\u2019m very invested. \n\n(ADHD here and I\u2019m an adult with a stuffie too so plop on these rude commenters here not understanding ND)", "Gotcha. I hope he turns up. You\u2019re being an amazing boyfriend to her. I hope you stay healthy.", "I think it might be under the bed, in case you haven't looked there yet. If not there, then in the refrigerator.", "Definitely a good dude, NAH. \n\nSounds like she's upset to the point where until Angry Bunny is found, it's gonna be tough. \n\nI wouldn't take it personally that your lead didn't pan out. To her, it had to feel like an emotional rollercoaster, going from Excited Anticipation to Disappointed Devastation and if she said something like \"you should have told me earlier!\" or whatever... I'm sure it's more from frustration at the situation than any kind of bad feeling towards you.\n\nExtreme emotions and rational thoughts rarely go hand in hand.\n\nSpeaking of emotions, I sure hope you give us an update or two. I think enough of us are emotionally invested in what happens at this point, it just would be cruel to leave us wondering if Angry Bunny was ever found.", "It genuinely sounds like he\u2019s in just as much emotional distress as his gf, and his reactions to people putting her down are so sweet. Defs NTA", "Thank you for this!  I got a geriatric diagnosis and am trying to make sense of my life at 75.  I do sense all sorts of objects as living and having feelings.  I never associated it with my series of diagnoses, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s one more drain on my already limited energy.", "So what's the problem", "Honestly. As an autistic person who has lost stuff way way way too much and had many FaceTime calls to my mum of us hunting for stuff this can be great. Even if it isn\u2019t successful it\u2019s the appreciation that someone else cares that you are struggling over the missing thing. And then once you are covid free if it hasn\u2019t been found you could look together. But sometimes just having someone who is able to act slightly more rationally than you walk you through the places to look (And definitely try under/beside/any other angle of the bed) can really make the difference as it gets hard to see it even if it\u2019s in front of you as it \u201ccan\u2019t be there\u201d cause it\u2019s the wrong spot, or you\u2019ve looked there (but perhaps not very well).\n\nBut also as people have said definitely do not try to do the stealth replacement I don\u2019t know a single person who has managed to successfully stealth replace something important.", "Hey dad, can I please have one hundred dollars that I will chuck at the first adult the gets to close to me", "You want my money? Go and get it.", "Love this suggestion and hate most of these asshole responses.", "Autism isn\u2019t a disease or disorder (yes I know technically it\u2019s in the DSM as a \u201cdisorder\u201d) like Alzheimers or epilepsy. It\u2019s a neurological difference. It doesn\u2019t need to be cured and in many cases, it doesn\u2019t need to be treated. It is still a disability though, but we live in a neurotypical society.", "Need an understudybunny", "No. Fabricated companions are friends. We don't leave our friends behind.", "We can not rule out the construction of said wall either.

Good for you for being that patient.", "Maybe you can video call each other? Obviously it isn\u2019t the same as looking together, but you\u2019ll still be able to help her and maybe a place you haven\u2019t searched yet comes up in your mind.

A neurotype is not something to be treated or cured. Understood, absolutely. But different neurotype aren\u2019t sicknesses.", "Same!
