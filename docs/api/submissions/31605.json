The sign on the window says we close at 10PM and he'd had all evening to trade in his tickets. Then theres how the trade would have been. Hey, for all I know he could have been in at 10:02  everything neat and knowing exactly what he wanted. Or he could have been in later with a whole lot of crumpled up tickets, as I'm counting them he's throwing more on the desk, he has multiple kids, the first one starts looking at the available prizes after I finish counting, not during, after taking ages to decide the second one hasn't even looked and now it's their turn to start deciding on a prize. They choose the one thing their sibling didn't notice, now their sibling whats that as well and is trying to decide which prize they want to give back. Then to top that off somebody queues behind them thinking I must still be open. Could be either or anything in between. Alternatively  maybe when he went back to get his tickets he got distracted, maybe there was something on TV he wanted to watch. Sat down to watch, then decided it must be too late to come back and never did come back with tickets. I'd have been left waiting for nothing.\n\nAnyway I've gone on about that long enough, I didn't feel I was TA for leaving when my shift ended so I don't think you should either.", "Info: do you mean 1am?
