They paid me back for their portion already, but I made the reservation.\n\n  \nSIL relies heavily on her parents to take care of her children. Even as a SAHM, she has one or both of them at her house helping or sends her kids to their house a lot of the time. When all of them are together, I've noticed what regularly happens is the kids end up unsupervised because everyone thinks someone else is watching them. When we're around, suddenly we end up in charge of the kids without being asked or even informed. One time, I was upstairs with my kids, their kids were downstairs, and they all left to grab lunch for us without telling me they were leaving. It's a big house, so I didn't hear them leave or the kids head outside to the yard while they were gone. When they returned, they saw the kids outside and tried to blame me for not watching them, when I had no idea they had left. Obviously, my husband set them straight and made sure they understood that if they wanted us to watch the kids they needed to ask us so that we know we're supposed to be in charge. I felt good about booking the vacation after this conversation.  \nA few weeks later, we were all at a small public beach together. We started bringing our stuff down to the beach and one of their kids wanted to come with us, so FIL said \"OK, go ahead with them,\" loud enough for me to hear. Not asking, but at least I'm being informed that I'm in charge of him now and presumably they're following closely behind. After at least 10 minutes at the beach, they still haven't arrived and I notice their other child in the water by himself. I tell him to get out of the water and come over by me. I ask if they know he's down here and he says yes, that they told him he could come down and swim. He wasn't told to even check in with us so we knew he was there. I feel this is completely unsafe as I very easily could not have seen him in the water, and we had already had a very clear conversation about supervision of the children. I was too angry to have a productive conversation, and they are ones that immediately get defensive and shut down or get combative at any hint of confrontation, so we said nothing and just finished the beach day. \n\n  \nOnce we got home, I told my husband I'm not comfortable going to the beach with them again and I canceled the reservation on the beach house. He returned their money and told them it\u2019s because of what happened at the beach. Obviously, they were very upset and felt they deserved another chance because they had informed me about one child and the other child was supposed to check in with us and didn\u2019t, so how can I punish all of them. My husband also feels that because they paid for their portion, it wasn\u2019t necessarily fair of me to cancel it and we could\u2019ve just had mostly separate vacations and refused to go to the beach with them.

It's danger as hell AND it's completely unfair to you.\n\nYour husband isn't realizing that if SIL et al come along, even with \"separate vacations\" you wont have that. If they see you even for a moment, or THINK you 'will return soon' they will send or leave a kid by you. Their existence with those kids is a series of unfortunate accidents waiting to happen, and you are the one finger-pointed at time and time again for their own negligence.\n\nAnd make no mistake, they are all incredibly negligent with those kids. And you... you are not the babysitter. In fairness to yourself, no more \"vacations\" where they and the kids will be there. There is no way to relax for you, it's like a giant setup waiting for something bad to happen.", "NTA their way of supervision is totally unsafe.  I wouldn\u2019t not feel comfortable going to the beach with them again.  That day at the beach was their second chance.  You had already expressed boundaries and they still ignored them.\n\nI\u2019d tell husband it was them or you guys canceling the house because there\u2019s no way to feel comfortable going if they went too.  The money was returned they can find somewhere else or go a different time.", "NTA. They're consistently trampling boundaries and neglecting their own children. Who goes off to have lunch and leaves their kids behind?", "Firstly, you don't bet on second chances with child drownings.\n\nSecondly, they would definitely blame you for it even if you had no idea that the child had been left in your supervision because they forgot to ask. Again. Because people like that always pass the blame. Just like they did when they left their kids downstairs by themselves without telling you - only it would tear your family apart. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThere is no \u201cseparate vacation\u201d with those people. They will dump the kids on you and not even inform you. Imagine something happens to a kid on your watch when you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s your watch.", "NTA\nTheir habit of neglecting to supervise their children nor communicate when \"passing\" supervision to another adult is more than just rude, invalidating to the unwitting babysitter, frightening and irresponsible. It's dangerous to their kids. I wouldn't be willing to facilitate a beach vacation where their poorly supervised children could be seriously injured. The kid's being injured \"not on my watch\" would not make the vacation any less ruined.\n\nNTA for not only being unwilling to have your niblings abandoned to your care, but for also being unwilling to be a spectator to dangerous child neglect.", "NTA water related deaths are a huge cause of childhood deaths. Don't mess with water and unsupervised kids. Heaven forbid one of her kids drowns when they decide you should watch them without communicating this with you they'll blame you forever. Better to cancel and no longer do things like this with them than have a child be kidnapped or dead.", "But you can't have \"mostly separate\" vacations. Because they will send the kids over without asking and they you go out not knowing and it's your fault.\n\nThey sent the second child after you without asking. Again. They already had their second chance. What they are doing is entirely unsafe. Asking is not just a courtesy but a necessity for safety. I suppose not one of them has a mobile?\n\nThis would not be a holiday for you and I don't blame you for cancelling. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you already know how this is going to play out. You've just saved yourself the hassle and aggravation.", "I would NEVER forgive myself if a child was put at risk because of a casual presumption I was watching them. \n\nThey are not safe people - they risk their kids' lives from sheer laziness, and I couldn't EVER risk the blame or guilt of something terrible happening therefore landing on me.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I think they\u2019ll learn their lesson after this", "Well, I suppose you didn't have to cancel it and yes you could have gone separate with vacations...\n\nHonestly seems like they might be inclined to dump things on you anyway. So better safe than sorry - they seem to give you a lot of anxiety especially if they have a history of getting upset with you both for situations they caused themselves, including this one.", "NTA it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t go to the beach with them, clearly they are going to send the kids to you without letting you know and something dangerous could very easily happen. You saved yourself a headache. Enjoy your vacation.", "NTA  They are not getting it, until you feel confident that this issue is resolved, I wouldnt book any joint ventures.", "NTA. Your husband needs to understand their children will get hurt one day and they will blame it on you if you keep letting them. You did the right thing. They don't respect you or your boundaries. I would never let them supervise my children either. As if they let the others unsupervised they'd let yours get in danger as well.", "Nta. You gave them back their money.

The supervision thing is a genuine issue that needs to be resolved but they paid for the own vacation, it wasn't yours to cancel.", "YTA, they already paid for it, probably organized their times.
