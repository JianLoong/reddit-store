I come from a very traditional, if not stereotypical, latino family. The chisme (gossip) is DEEPLY ENGRAINED in the whole family.  I have about 7 uncles, one of which is also bisexual like myself. He got married sometime ago and when he sent out invites to the whole family, a large majority of them declined because \"religious reasons\" which really saddened him.  I kept this in mind when it came time to send out my invitations and those particular family members did not get one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago, my husband and I went to my dad's house for the annual family reunion.  I really didn't want to go because I knew in the back of my mind this absolutely was going to get around, despite the lack of posting on any social media, but my dad and mom really wanted me there. They are very supportive and the \"Be loud and proud\" type people and I love them to death for it, even if it's a little obnoxious (the spirit is what counts though right?).  I voiced this concern to my dad and he was very insistent that if shit goes south, he'll be right there to laugh about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire time, my husband and I are getting some intense side eye. The family that didn't attend didn't even try to hide the fact that they were whispering about my husband and I. About 2 hours later as I am 6 or so whiskeys in, the straight uncles took initiative and decided to \"ambush\" me and ask why they weren't invited.  I was polite and reminded them that they turned down the bi uncle's wedding for the religious reasons. They responded with at least wanting to be thought about and being invited. I told them that I did think about them and decided they weren't worth the $.57 postage to be told they weren't going to attend for bigoted reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be understating to say that their reaction was less than pleased. Shit hit MULTIPLE fans. My uncles went off for being compared to a postage stamp. My dad was EATING it up. My mom was a little pissy at me for causing a disturbance in her house though (which unfortunately made me question everything at that moment).  My grandma was giving me the \"Judges in Spanish\" look.  My husband kind of grabbed my hand and said lets get out of here before you piss off any more people (in a laughing manner), and proceeded to drive us home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad sent me a \"That's my boy! Good on you for standing up for yourself!\" text. My mom was still less than thrilled about how things went down. My bi uncle sent me a text \"Saying thank you for standing up for me but, now my relationship with my brothers is strained to hell and I didn't want that.\"  My phone and social media have been blowing the hell up ever since then but I'm kind of ignoring it though. But I do feel bad for my uncle because he just wants to be close with ALL his brothers and not just one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, AITA for how things went down?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To broadly state this, I have apologized to my uncle for using him as an example in what happened and I truly didn't mean to make things harder for him with his brothers. I also expressed that it isn't exactly healthy for his well being to want to put up with them knowing how they feel about him before any of this happened. He kind of remains silent on the topic so I'm trying to leave it alone and not force it.", "created_utc": 1674258693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hd3wh/aita_for_not_stating_why_certain_members_of_my/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or did they want to be able to make a big show of rejecting your invitation and passing judgement?\n\nEither way, as much as it sucks for your uncle now, if his relationship with his brothers was built on ignoring their homophobia, he's really not in as good as place as he thinks he is. It might benefit him in the long run for the family to be called out and hopefully let everyone cultivate more authentic relationships in the future.
