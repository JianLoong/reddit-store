Her and her boyfriend are not struggling financially, but their standard of living has very much decreased since giving birth. They can afford the necessities, but they can't go on vacation, can't go out to eat and can't afford a babysitter. They also just moved into a cheaper apartment. My mom has been asking my sister and the baby to move in with her so they can save money (my sister said no). \n\n  \nFor more context, my sister's boyfriend makes a little less than minimum wage. He only works part-time at a restaurant to focus on creating his music. When my sister announced they were trying for a baby, my mom was really worried (and she's still worried) about their financial situation. My sister is the primary income source for their household and my mom has been giving them some money every month.  I make a little more than my sister but I don't have kids. \n\n  \nSo last night, all of us came together for dinner. My sister kept asking me when I'm going to have kids and I said I don't plan on having kids. She said I'll change my mind (I'm almost 30). I said I probably won't and she kept pressing me on why. I finally just said \"I don't want kids, I want money\" and she got really quiet. When the dinner was over, she left a voicemail to my mom crying about how I attacked her and my mom is mad at me. My mom wants me to apologize to my sister.\n\n  \nTo be clear, I do think my sister is in a nightmare situation but I would have said I wanted money even if she didn't have a baby. I've always thought I'm not meant for parenthood and I'd rather just be the cool, fun aunt that travels a lot and buys big presents for my nieces/nephews. I didn't mean to insult her and I've never once commented on her financials or relationship because it's not my place.

If you were sitting at dinner and just randomly blurted out \"I don't want kids, I want money\" that would be an AH thing to say to your sister. But when she starts asking when you're gonna have kids, and especially when she refused to drop it, she's asking for a response like this.", "She asked. You answered. She didn't like your answer? That's on her for pressing you for one in the first place. You didn't attack her, you pissed her off by being honest, and that's not your fault at all. \n\nNTA and I don't think you owe her an apology, but a conversation is a good idea. It sounds like she's actually pretty upset herself about her finances and your response touched a nerve. Maybe start with something like, \"Hey, it wasn't my intention to offend you in any way, and I'm honestly confused as to why this upset you so much. I gave you my honest answer after being pressured, and I can't help feeling like maybe this is really about something else.\"", "NTA, she shouldn\u2019t have kept pushing you about having a baby once you had answered her. I hate it when people repeatedly force a question until you give them the answer they want. You don\u2019t have to justify not wanting kids to her.", "NTA still reliant on mommy for money, throwing tantrums, and crying to mommy over nothing? So very mature enough to raise a child! Good luck to that child, yikes. Hopefully she\u2019s not usually like this.\n\n> She said I'll change my mind\n\nThe only parents who say this seem to be the ones who have some regrets. \n\nNothing wrong with wanting money and not kids", "NTA. Kids are expensive. You stated a fact. I have two. I\u2019d rather have them than money, but I understand other people have different priorities. \n\nBut I think your sister\u2019s question was obnoxious. It\u2019s wrong to ask someone when they\u2019re going to have a baby. Some people don\u2019t want children. Others struggle with infertility. Some people want to be married first. But the fact is that nothing could be less anyone else\u2019s business than another person\u2019s family planning.", "NTA. Dont ask questions you dont want answers you dont like to. \n\nAlso,the whole gross pressuring to have kids thing is rude and obnoxious and frankly people doing it should expect pushback and for the person they're doimg it to not to be very nice about it. Its a personal decision that someone else doesnt get to decide for you.", "NTA.  You were pressed and gave an honest answer about your preferred lifestyle.  You did nothing wrong.  Your sister did by pressing the question and then not liking the truthful answer.", "Your sister is presumptuous enough to ask when you're having kids, disregard your response and tell you that you'll change your mind, continue pressing the topic, get all up in her feelings about your honesty, and then have the audacity to behave as though she was the attacked one in this situation. You were much nicer to her than I would have been to a family member who made this much of an issue of it with me. NTA, not even a little bit.\n \nAlso, it sounds like her and her boyfriend *are* struggling financially. People who are not struggling financially generally don't need monthly assistance from a family member. They might be affording necessities now, but one missed paycheck for either and they're screwed.", "NTA.  She asked.  You answered.  If she didn't want to hear the answer, she shouldn't have asked.", "He makes less than minimum wage because he works part time to focus on his music??!!??\n\nWTH?\n\nIts one thing if she just has a really great job that pays wonderfully and they were not struggling at all but they have a baby on the way and  are having to cut back and get a cheaper place and her mother is having to give them money. The father needs to man up and get his ass to work  and support his family. As it stands he needs to be the house husband in a serious way.\n\nalso nta\n\nYour sister would not drop the subject after pressing several times. Also your comment was not about her but because of her reaction the subject of many and the baby is heavy on her mind.\n\nPeople have said i would want a child some day also. I am mid 40s and still have no desire at all.  If people talk about it I traumatize them with stories about my brother from when he was a child. That will cure them of any thoughts of having a child and they leave me alone. Works every time. I have even told my brother that he has cured me of ever wanting one and then reminded him about different times he has done stuff.", "NTA. As a 30-something who has never wanted kids (and a woman, which makes it worse!), I get so tired of \u201cyou\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d Anyone who is pushing you on this deserves a snarky response.", "NTA. You told the truth and she couldn't handle it. She chose to press you on a personal topic instead of leaving well enough alone. That's a 'her' problem. Do not apologize. What would you even be apologizing for? Sorry I am prioritizing financial security? No. Stand firm on your beliefs. \nThe thing is, you have YEARS to change your mind and decide to have kids. Adoption is ALWAYS available. But there is not an UNDO button on bringing life into the world. It is infinitely better to err on the side of not wanting kids, then to resent your children all their lives.", "NTA - sounds like my mother and sister to my bro.  I've been with my wife for 25+ years, got 2 kids, etc... the whole kit.  My sis with her hubby got 2 kids but my bro and his gf don't have any and said multiple times it's not in their plans... like for 10 years...  (but he's 10 years younger than I am) and it's ssooo easy to see from my siblings & parents life, my sis and mine that we can't afford what my bro can, it's a life choice.  I had to shut down my mom so often when I saw the subject coming up before my bro said anything... like, even if it wasn't mostly about the money... it's not in his/their plans, stop fucking pushing. Every time I get the death stare from my mom... like seriously?!\n\nSome people simply can't fathom going through life without having kids... it's insane.  Your thoughts on the matter are irrelevant to other couples, shove it.\n\nYour sister couldn't handle the truth (cue Jack Nicholson), and your mom can't wrap her head around it either.\n\nAt most, apologize for being so blunt, but the fact remains that what you said is essentially what you want from life, your sis needs to drop the subject.", "If they can't afford a babysitter on a regular basis and can't afford to go out to eat, then how are they not financially struggling?", "NTA - I hate this so much.  The only time I've ever felt bad about not wanting kids is when others made me feel bad about NOT feeling bad about not wanting them.  Your sister made the decisions she did and we hope they bring her joy.  You are making the decisions that will bring you joy.  She can be emotional now - she seems to be facing an increasing amount of instability with a partner that isn't prioritizing her and the child.  That sucks, but she also seems to have had indicators that would happen.", "NTA.  She asked you a question about you & you provided her with an answer that was about you.  If you didn't make any statement about her personally, she has no right to be offended or even to take office.  \n\nYou don't owe any apology to your sister for honestly answering a question she asked you about you.  In fact your sister seems to be a bit spoiled & is overly emotional regarding something that isn't about her.  Advise your Mom of this & tell her it's your sister who owes you an apology for continuously harassing you about your personal life & then whining to Mom because she didn't like the answer.", "I have kids and don't blame others who have decided not to have children.  It's not for everyone.  And yes, kids are expensive and do drain the finances.  Personally, I think anyone who plans on falling pregnant without proper finances is crazy.", "Nta\n\n\nYour sister can freak off. Kids are wonderful when you want them. However, there are sacrifices.\n\n\nLike finances. Your sister needs to back off. Asking about kids is not an appropriate response.  She is lucky your mom is helping financially.", "NTA. She should have accepted your position instead of continuing to push it. \n\nAnd you\u2019re not wrong. Kids are expensive as hell. I say this as the mother of two teens.", "NTA. I guess I can see how she thought you were implying something, but she did ask.", "NTA and I think I\u2019ve said nearly the same thing myself \ud83d\ude00 Your sister was being rude not dropping the subject, you merely gave her a definitive answer that stopped the line of questioning \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA but your sister is. Questions on people starting a family is very personal, ask once then STFU.  Are you even in the type of a relationship that would make her think that you are interested in starting a family?", "NTA. Just because you were honest, and she had a kid with a loser so she feels bad about her life decisions, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re attacking her.", "And no one is going to address the fact that this girl was harassing you about a very personal and individual choice? Your sister fucked around and found out. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIf your sister didn't want your answer, she shouldn't have so loudly and crassly demanded it.\n\nI'd ask your Mum what she thinks you have to apologise for: your sister's disrespect, her rudeness, her arrogance, her insulting demeanour or the fact that you answered a question your sister had no business asking.", "NTA. I swear it's like everyone with kids wants everyone without to have them and be as miserable as they r. It seems like parents want everyone else to be parents too but they sure don't make a very good case for it.", "Explain to her that asking over and over about when are you gonna have kids is very annoying but that you didnt mean to offend her and that you truly feel like you would rather focus on your finances than have a child and she should respect that,  just like you respect her choice to make sacrifices in order to have a child and that you love your nephew or niece and yada yada yada.", "NTA - she asked you, you answered.... then she asked again and again and again. I don't get why people do that? They're not going to miraculously like the answer the 3rd or 4th time they ask.", "NTA. Your sister needs to chill and stop pressuring you about having kids. It's your life, not hers. And honestly, who doesn't want money? That's just common sense.", "Your sister had a baby with a broke musician and is now taking care of two children. Sounds like she is struggling with more than just finances. \n\nNTA. I also do not want kids, nor will I ever and I have had similar responses. It is not my dream to be solely a mother. Shouldn't have to be explained.", "NTA and you do not owe her an apology. People should not ask a question if they are not prepared to hear an answer that they may not like.", "NTA - People shouldn't ask questions if they don't want honest answers.  With your family you should be able to be honest most all of the time.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn\u2019t comment on her situation you were talking about yourself AND SHE ASKED. \n\nNot your fault she took offense.\nIt\u2019s true- kids cost money and not having them gives you more for other things", "NTA\n Ask the question, be prepared for the answer, especially if you keep telling me I don't know my own mind.\n\nAnd if your sis is needing to take money from Mom just to make it, they are having financial troubles and BIL needs to grow up and getting a fucking job (full time). Practice your music when you're not dealing with the ramifications of bringing a kid into the world.", "NTA - Your mom wants to keep the peace.  But I don't see how you stating your preferences for life choices (that aren't your sister's choices) come across as you \"attacking her.\"  Just because you want something different means you are \"attacking her?\"  That's insane.\n\nI wouldn't apologize.  You spoke your truth after being pressed for the reason why you don't want to have a child.", "To quote Homer Simpson\n\n\"Oh, I have three kids and no money.

She asked, you answered. Also if you are/are going to be decidedly childless, you owe nobody a reason/justification as to why.", "YNTA.\n\nIn my honest opinion, your sister is being dramatic. She probably knows she didn't make the best decision financially and took your answer to heart because of it. \nYou could have worded it differently. She could have also just dropped it after you gave your answer. She continued to press on it and basically dismissed your answer and told you what you would be doing in your future.\n\nWhat you did was certainly not an attack, it was a reaction. She kept asking you why, and she got her answer.\n\nFrom my experience people who do this, usually do it to convince everyone including themselves they are doing the right thing.", "NTA", "Nta and your sister is insanely irresponsible to be having another child if they\u2019re already struggling.
