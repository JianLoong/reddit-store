It was in rough shape and I spent a lot of time and money making improvements and renovations.  It's not a big house, only 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, but it works for our small family.  But about a month ago, my wife found out that she is pregnant.  It's completely unexpected but we are both incredibly excited.  However, we don't have room for the baby in our current home so we will need to find a new place.  \n\nGiven the renovations that I had already done on our home, the value increased a lot and since my wife had been living here for a long time, her mortgage was low and we would get a very nice return if we sold.

What you can't afford is to continue financially supporting an adult daughter. \n\nIt sounds like what you've asked her to pay is fair and it's awesome that you have been transparent about budgeting. NTA, but it's going to be a sticky situation if she simply refuses to pay. You'll need to work out with your wife at what point y'all will actually kick her out.", "NTA - and Ann is 22 - tell her if she doesn't contribute she has to move to the couch and give up the room to the baby.  She never liked you and never will so don't expect a better response.", "INFO: What happens if she moves out of the new house in a couple of years? How would that affect your ability to pay the mortgage?", "NTA. Ann needs to contribute something to the household. Even it\u2019s just $100. So what if she never had to pay before, she\u2019s an adult now and y\u2019all are struggling. She needs to help or find other living arrangements. She sounds very immature.", "INFO:\n\nPretend your wife didn't get pregnant:  What was the plan here long-term?\n\nI find Ann's response to be alarming and very immature for a 22 year old and your wife's insistence that a 22 year old adult have her own room in your new house which kind of implies that nobody is ever expecting Ann to be an independent adult.  Is she in school?  Does she have a disability that prevents her from living independently?  Is she just planning to live with you forever like some weird throuple?", "INFO: how much are you expecting Ann to pay? Asking her to split the bills is definitely fair, but suddenly expecting market rent from your struggling stepdaughter bc you moved for the shiny new baby is a dick move.\n\nETA: you would not be TA to ask for like $300 plus utilities, or even a flat number like $500 to be like \"this covers your food plus utilities plus a nominal 'rent amount' because you are an adult. If you want to do a vo-tech program or something and would be able to work less we can revisit\"", "NTA. She is 22 which makes her an adult. If she can't afford to live on her own, then she will need to make some decisions like everyone else. She needs to grow up.", "INFO: If Ann decided not to move with you to the new house, how would you manage the payments? A mortgage is 30 years, and presumably, Ann will move out eventually. It makes no sense to account for Ann's rent money in your long-term budget since even if you did convince her to pay it, it wouldn't be a long-term line item. \n\nRe-do your budget and don't include any money from Ann in it. Make sure you account for your wife's paycheck in there too. How much parental leave does she get and how much of it is paid? Does she definitely want to go back to work full time after the baby comes or is there a chance she's going to want to stay home full- or part-time? If there's even a small chance that you'll become a single income family, you definitely don't want to have just bought a house you could barely afford on two incomes. \n\nAlso, think about other creative ways to get what you need without buying a whole new house. You're handy enough to have done a lot of reno work -- can you build a small addition? Is there a closet you can transform into a small nursery area? Babies don't really need a ton of space, especially when they're newborns -- look up how NYC parents put cribs in closets and squeeze baby stuff into tiny apartments for some ideas. I bet if you really think about it there are a lot of ways to make your current space work for you for a little while longer, to give yourselves more time to save up and plan for this next phase of your lives. Plus, there's a pretty good chance that Ann will get annoyed about living with a baby and want to move out anyway when it arrives, so that would solve your problem too.", "NTA. It sounds like you have crunched numbers and are not demanding anything unreasonable, unless the rent amount is wild, which I would think her mom wouldn't allow. Paying basic living expenses like housing is part of life and she is old enough to start doing it while still having a safety net.", "NTA -  It is entirely reasonable to expect another adult living under your roof to contribute to the household. \n\nThat said, you shouldn't make any financial decisions that would cause you to rely on that income because it could cause issues for all parties involved when she's ready to move out and stand on her own two feet.", "INFO - IS the [previous on](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x3ggn/aita_for_asking_step_daughter_to_move_out/)e your story too or did you rewrite someone else's?", "NTA if she does not want to contribute then don\u2019t get a 3 bedroom you can\u2019t afford. You shouldn\u2019t be overtaxing yourself financially to go bigger on a house you can\u2019t afford when she isn\u2019t willing to contribute. Does she go to school is that why she has 2 part time jobs? What are her future plans? She clearly didn\u2019t plan on moving out any time soon so what were her financial goals to do so? She is 22 not 18 at this point she needs to figure out what she wants to do with her life and not feel so entitled to live somewhere for free.", "**NTA**\n\n> She said that we are forcing her to bend to our rules or make herself homeless because she can't afford to live on her own.\n\nUm, she's 22 and hasn't launched and putting herself at risk of homelessness.   If she's not in training or education, she should be contributing to having a roof over her head.   Why is she working 2 marginal jobs rather than looking for something that would actually support her?   Does she have any actual goals?   If she has no skills, she can get in training.  \n \n> My wife was insistent on it being 3 bedrooms because she wants Ann to have a space in the new house too\n\nThen her daughter should be prepared to contribute to the space.   Do some market research on rental prices in the neighborhood you want to move to and offer Anne a market rate for rental with a family discount.", "Regardless of the new baby adults, let alone working adults should contribute to the household. If my autistic adult son can work and contribute, then so can Ann.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think Ann is either. You have every right to ask her to contribute, but I think she reacted very emotionally for a reason. I\u2019d look more into why, and good luck!", "Ann needs to grow up and mom needs to help her do it.  Ann needs to move out and make a life for herself asap. Once she's out she doesn't need a room devoted to her.\n\nCharge her rent and part of the cost of utilities. Encourage her to get a full time job. The reality of life is you have to learn to take care of yourself.  \n\nAsk yourself if the worst happened and you all passed away who would take care of Ann? Ann will have to so get her ready now.\n\nI raised 2 sons as a single parent.  My job was to raise them to be independent and take care themselves. I had a rule if you went to college you could stay with me if not get a job and take care of yourself. They've been doing it since they were 18. I'm a happy grandma to 6 grandkids now.", "INFO: Is Anne in school? What are her prospects for full-time work?", "INFO: it doesn't sound as if Anna is in college. What's her medium term plan for becoming economically independent?  If she doesn't have or isn't working toward one she should contribute now that she's a adult.  If she is progressing and your demand would slow her down recommend you shelve it.", "NTA.\n\nAnn is a grown woman, not a child. If she can pay for her car, she can pay rent", "Nta she an adult with a Job she should be paying rent and be gracious she's lived there rent free since leaving school", "NTA.  If Ann was in school, I would say she shouldn't have to contribute.  But, she is 22 and working.  It's time for her to have adult responsibilities.  Contributing to the household will be much more affordable for her than getting out on her own", "I'm confused. Is she in school? If not, is she working towards a certification or something? I just don't get what endgame is for her of she's working two low-paying jobs and living with her parents at 22. Does she expect to do so indefinitely? Is there some reason she can't live independently?", "Even after paying her phone and car , with working 2 min. wage jobs, she should have some money left. I imagine she doesn't spend much on food either so where does the money go ?\n\nShe is 22 years old working woman there is no need for her to live free anywhere but her own home. If she doesn't like it she can move out and find a better option.\n\nNTA", "NTA. 22 year olds can pay rent. There\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t.", "NAH, if you can\u2019t afford to buy a house without Ann paying rent then that is not the house for you because the moment tensions boil over which is highly likely once the new baby is born she will leave and stop paying rent. Now with that said, Ann is an adult and she does need to start making plans for the future and living on her own. I would sit down and look at her budget with her. See what she can afford to pay in rent each month, charge her that but put it in a savings account. After a year give it back to her so she has the means to move out and start a life on her own. This will in that year teach her to budget within reason and give her a nice nest egg to start living on her own because once your baby is born I promise she will start to have second thoughts of wanting to live at home with a new born and you do not want someone who\u2019s forced to stay there due to lack of funds. It will start to build resentment on both sides.", "NTA. Ann is a working adult and can financially contribute to the household. Her saying that you care more about an unborn child is unfair. You are not forcing her to be homeless unless you literally throw her out on the street.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. If she decided she wants to move out now, you wouldn\u2019t really even need to get another house for a while. So if she continues to live with you, she should contribute something.", "INFO \nIf Ann doesn't want to pay, would you buy another 2 bedroom house or stay in the current house and have her move out as soon as you don't want the baby in your room with you?", "NTA. You crunched the numbers, y\u2019all need some help and this is an opportunity for her to step up and help the family. I imagine you wouldn\u2019t be wanting to bleed her dry of money either, that she would have more money than if she had to find her own place", "NTA -  The only reason you need a larger house is because this grown adult is refusing to launch in any meaningful way.      If if she doesn't want to contribute to a joint household, she can move out and manage on her own.  You will then have a room for your baby and everything will be fine.", "NTA. She's an adult. You're making a generous offer allowing her to stay with you, probably for cheaper than she could find on her own. \n\nJust make sure you can afford the house if Ann moves out or stops paying rent or something. Really it would be cleanest if she moved out on her own at the same time you were moving.", "NTA\n\nShe should be contributing something. Maybe not market rate rent, but a portion of the utilities at least. That is the real world. Ann is not longer going to be the baby. And the real world will hit her in the ass at some point. Prep her now. She is 22 already. She doesn't want to go to college. Fine. It isn't for anyone, but does she have any long term plans?", "NTA. It is not unreasonable to expect and adult to contribute to the household. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re expecting her to contribute 1/3 but something reasonable within her earnings. I\u2019m not sure where in the world you are so not sure if culture play into it.  You\u2019re not replacing her or turning her mother against her, you\u2019re expecting her to start adulting and she\u2019s sounds rather immature for a 22yo", "Lol Ann is right\u2026it is OP\u2019s choice to have a kid and it\u2019s also their choice to not have to move to a bigger house to accommodate her.

So it is completely reasonable for her to chip in according her salary \nAbsolutely,she should already be contributing to food bills and possibly utility bills, since she is working... She is not a baby of family. If she doesn't want to contribute and you can't afford a 3 bedroom house. You will have to get a 2 bedroom house and she won't have a room to live in with you at all..

You seem to think the parents are gods and not people trying to survive.\n\nEdit: that fate* isn\u2019t fair", "They can afford if all the adults living there are contributing or if all the adults not contributing are not living there.", "You are not meant to but there comes an age when the children can no longer complain if you do not pay all their expenses and treat them like toddlers.", "She doesn't have to live with them", "Pretty sure that \"support\" is called rent.\n\nNot sure where you live but it is fairly common.", "I'd think long and hard about that, she already hates it and it isn't even born yet.", "Of course and I think you are being totally reasonable.  Just an idea.", "But right now she already feels obligated to pay for the baby. You\u2019re already setting up an environment for resentment.  If you insist on doing this it this way, you will all  need family counseling. The neutral dynamic you two have is about to sour very quickly.", "I had very involved parents and they still needed baby sitting services regularly. Being involved doesn\u2019t make you omnipresent. You don\u2019t need a babysitter just so you can have time for yourself. There will be a lot of things outside of the home that have to be done and it\u2019s not always practical to bring your child with you.", "I'm glad you plan on being a very involved parent, but so do most parents and they *consistently* need  time away from their children, together as a couple and solo. It's not about \"needing a break sometimes,\" it's about a healthy balance. This goes double for mothers and triple for older mothers. Social wellbeing matters. Also, kids need adjust to parents being away and dealing with substitute authority figures. \n\nAlso, in most places, babysitters cost between $15 to $20 an hour, so even occasionally, it can still be a substantial item in one's budget. \n\nYour wife's daughter is your family. I'm not suggesting you're some kind of monster, but maybe evaluate her inclusion in the family home as something other than a flat financial analysis.", "They would have a tight budget if she left. OP said it was doable but tight. Also, they could downsize with Anne gone. \n\nShould they get a house they can afford on their own without her? Yes! \nShould she still contribute to the household as a grown woman with two jobs? Yes!", "Ann apparently doesn't pay for food or utilities, so these costs would decrease if she moved out, increasing the availability to pay for the mortgage.", "Right, they shouldn't. But then Ann needs to move out.", "I agree completely. It makes more senses for Ann to move out", "Ok.. once again.. he said they could afford it. Personally I think they should add on instead of buying a whole ass new home. Especially in today\u2019s market!! Right? But, I also feel regardless of that the daughter IS old enough to be paying rent. (As you did).  I\u2019m really not understanding the whole live at home for free until your parents are dead mindset these days. (Not saying you said that) I saw a report on good morning America last week that said many adults are living at home and not paying rent but are buying luxury goods. That passed me off! If you can afford luxury goods you can afford rent somewhere. But I guess if parents put up with it.. it doesn\u2019t teach life skills though. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I said you were contradicting yourself. I must have misunderstood.", "NTA\n\nInfo.. why don\u2019t you add on to\nThe home you have? Build a nice master bathroom with a bath then everyone still gets a space and it\u2019s way less expensive! But still charge rent to daughter as she should learn life skills, it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge amount.. but she should at her age of 22 have to pay something.", "This is exactly about the principle of helping out. Anne is upset because she no longer gets to live somewhere for free. She didn\u2019t say \u201cwell this is all I can do\u201d, she threw a childish fit. \n\nOP never said they had a budget deficit, he said they would have a tight budget. Further tightened by her. That\u2019s a big difference.", "minimum month wage , by working parttime. but i have shown taxes would be in between 10 till 12%.", "Actually I moved out at 17, am in my early 30s and own my own house \ud83d\ude05 but I can see why my stance would lead you to think that", "Landlords don\u2019t tell their tenants that the reasons\n they bought the property is because of them. OP\u2019s stance is Ann needs to help with the added expenses of this house because they\u2019re buying it so she can continue living with them. That\u2019s stupid because if/when Ann moves out they will struggle to make ends meet.", "I think I either misinterpreted the post or possibly you did, because from my understanding, the OP's wife wants her to have a bedroom in their house regardless of whether she moves in or not. So there's no 2 bedroom scenario as you put it. And I think maybe your interpretation is that she only wants her to have a bedroom there if she is moving in?", "my point is wouldn't you want your daughter to save that money for herself and move out in a year or 2?", "I guess my question is wouldn't you want your daughter to be able to save that money instead? For her own future?", "If you and/or Ann equates contributing financially to a household as an adult to paying for a baby that isn't yours, then you're right, counseling would be needed.", "I'm not sure where this is coming from.  I had a very normal western upbringing, lived nowhere near any grandparents or aunts/uncles, and was babysat no more than twice a year my whole life. OP's budget doesn't seem to need such specificity that he's budgeting down to the $100 every six months...", "I'm still not sure exactly what you're trying to say here.  I feel like you're way too hung up on me having the audacity to not include babysitting in a preliminary budget.  But just to appease you, next time I start crunching some numbers, I'll be sure to add $100-200 a month for babysitting expenses.", "OP said the wife would want a 3 br anyway, with or without Ann there.", "I have no problem with Anne being asked to contribute. My issue is with her being asked to contribute to a house that her mother and stepfather can barely afford. Setting yourself up to be house poor is just irresponsible when you have a baby on the way.", "With a little one in the house? I highly doubt it. Raising a child is very expensive. It\u2019s way more costly than having an adult living with you rent free. Let\u2019s be honest here.", "I agree. I would have no problem with OP telling Ann that they can\u2019t afford to carry her anymore. They should give her a deadline to move out.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be. The appropriate answer is staring OP and his wife in the face: tell Ann she has to give up her room. It\u2019s the easiest solution because she\u2019s not paying rent anyway. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll gain some financial independence if that happens. Buying a house you can barely afford is just not smart.", "That\u2019s on them, and as I already mentioned to another confused commenter there are many options if and when that day comes.", "The wife specifically said she would want a new 3 br so Ann can have her own space. That implies that the wife realizes Ann doesn\u2019t get her own space in a 2br, new or not.", "There is another baby coming.  They need space.  If 22 wants to continue living at home, they need a larger house.  They cannot afford a larger house without ADULT daughter contributing.  I highly doubt they would be requiring the full marker price for her contribution", "Depends on how the daughter acts. \n\nBut having that disregard for an unborn child that is their sibling shows what a...self-centered person that daughter is.\n\nThat's not okay.", "OP doesn\u2019t even know what a babysitter costs these days. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019ll never need one. Even the most \u201cinvolved\u201d parents should have a go to baby sitter because as I said you can\u2019t be everywhere at once.", "They gotta kick her out then. Either way she\u2019ll throw a fit.", "But the little one is presumably already included in their budget for the new house.", "I can agree with that. Or give her a timeline. Sometimes you have to be made uncomfortable in order to grow.", "There might be options but it\u2019s still a bad idea. Why set yourself up to struggle financially? Would you want to spend thirty years finding ways to make a mortgage you can\u2019t afford? It makes way more sense to tell Ann that she has to give up her room. She\u2019s not paying rent anyway so she really can\u2019t argue with that.", "\"My wife was insistent on it being 3 bedrooms because she wants Ann to have a space in the new house too. \" \n\nThat's why they're buying a 3 bedroom, otherwise they could just ask her to leave, and keep the same house. I understand from this that the wife wants her daughter to have a room in their new house, regardless", "Raising children always costs more than you originally budgeted for.", "Don\u2019t disagree but I\u2019m confining myself to judging the question asked by OP", "\u2026if she pays rent, which is the only way they can afford it. What\u2019s the third magical option that you have in mind?"]}
