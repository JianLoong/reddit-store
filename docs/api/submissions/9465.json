It was in rough shape and I spent a lot of time and money making improvements and renovations.  It's not a big house, only 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, but it works for our small family.  But about a month ago, my wife found out that she is pregnant.  It's completely unexpected but we are both incredibly excited.  However, we don't have room for the baby in our current home so we will need to find a new place.  \n\nGiven the renovations that I had already done on our home, the value increased a lot and since my wife had been living here for a long time, her mortgage was low and we would get a very nice return if we sold.

What you can't afford is to continue financially supporting an adult daughter. \n\nIt sounds like what you've asked her to pay is fair and it's awesome that you have been transparent about budgeting. NTA, but it's going to be a sticky situation if she simply refuses to pay. You'll need to work out with your wife at what point y'all will actually kick her out.", "NTA - and Ann is 22 - tell her if she doesn't contribute she has to move to the couch and give up the room to the baby.  She never liked you and never will so don't expect a better response.", "INFO: What happens if she moves out of the new house in a couple of years? How would that affect your ability to pay the mortgage?", "NTA. Ann needs to contribute something to the household. Even it\u2019s just $100. So what if she never had to pay before, she\u2019s an adult now and y\u2019all are struggling. She needs to help or find other living arrangements. She sounds very immature.", "INFO:\n\nPretend your wife didn't get pregnant:  What was the plan here long-term?\n\nI find Ann's response to be alarming and very immature for a 22 year old and your wife's insistence that a 22 year old adult have her own room in your new house which kind of implies that nobody is ever expecting Ann to be an independent adult.  Is she in school?  Does she have a disability that prevents her from living independently?  Is she just planning to live with you forever like some weird throuple?", "INFO: how much are you expecting Ann to pay? Asking her to split the bills is definitely fair, but suddenly expecting market rent from your struggling stepdaughter bc you moved for the shiny new baby is a dick move.\n\nETA: you would not be TA to ask for like $300 plus utilities, or even a flat number like $500 to be like \"this covers your food plus utilities plus a nominal 'rent amount' because you are an adult. If you want to do a vo-tech program or something and would be able to work less we can revisit\"", "NTA. She is 22 which makes her an adult. If she can't afford to live on her own, then she will need to make some decisions like everyone else. She needs to grow up.", "INFO: If Ann decided not to move with you to the new house, how would you manage the payments? A mortgage is 30 years, and presumably, Ann will move out eventually. It makes no sense to account for Ann's rent money in your long-term budget since even if you did convince her to pay it, it wouldn't be a long-term line item. \n\nRe-do your budget and don't include any money from Ann in it. Make sure you account for your wife's paycheck in there too. How much parental leave does she get and how much of it is paid? Does she definitely want to go back to work full time after the baby comes or is there a chance she's going to want to stay home full- or part-time? If there's even a small chance that you'll become a single income family, you definitely don't want to have just bought a house you could barely afford on two incomes. \n\nAlso, think about other creative ways to get what you need without buying a whole new house. You're handy enough to have done a lot of reno work -- can you build a small addition? Is there a closet you can transform into a small nursery area? Babies don't really need a ton of space, especially when they're newborns -- look up how NYC parents put cribs in closets and squeeze baby stuff into tiny apartments for some ideas. I bet if you really think about it there are a lot of ways to make your current space work for you for a little while longer, to give yourselves more time to save up and plan for this next phase of your lives. Plus, there's a pretty good chance that Ann will get annoyed about living with a baby and want to move out anyway when it arrives, so that would solve your problem too.", "NTA. It sounds like you have crunched numbers and are not demanding anything unreasonable, unless the rent amount is wild, which I would think her mom wouldn't allow. Paying basic living expenses like housing is part of life and she is old enough to start doing it while still having a safety net.", "NTA -  It is entirely reasonable to expect another adult living under your roof to contribute to the household. \n\nThat said, you shouldn't make any financial decisions that would cause you to rely on that income because it could cause issues for all parties involved when she's ready to move out and stand on her own two feet.", "INFO - IS the [previous on](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x3ggn/aita_for_asking_step_daughter_to_move_out/)e your story too or did you rewrite someone else's?", "NTA if she does not want to contribute then don\u2019t get a 3 bedroom you can\u2019t afford. You shouldn\u2019t be overtaxing yourself financially to go bigger on a house you can\u2019t afford when she isn\u2019t willing to contribute. Does she go to school is that why she has 2 part time jobs? What are her future plans? She clearly didn\u2019t plan on moving out any time soon so what were her financial goals to do so? She is 22 not 18 at this point she needs to figure out what she wants to do with her life and not feel so entitled to live somewhere for free.", "**NTA**\n\n> She said that we are forcing her to bend to our rules or make herself homeless because she can't afford to live on her own.\n\nUm, she's 22 and hasn't launched and putting herself at risk of homelessness.   If she's not in training or education, she should be contributing to having a roof over her head.   Why is she working 2 marginal jobs rather than looking for something that would actually support her?   Does she have any actual goals?   If she has no skills, she can get in training.  \n \n> My wife was insistent on it being 3 bedrooms because she wants Ann to have a space in the new house too\n\nThen her daughter should be prepared to contribute to the space.   Do some market research on rental prices in the neighborhood you want to move to and offer Anne a market rate for rental with a family discount.", "Regardless of the new baby adults, let alone working adults should contribute to the household. If my autistic adult son can work and contribute, then so can Ann.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think Ann is either. You have every right to ask her to contribute, but I think she reacted very emotionally for a reason. I\u2019d look more into why, and good luck!", "Ann needs to grow up and mom needs to help her do it.  Ann needs to move out and make a life for herself asap. Once she's out she doesn't need a room devoted to her.\n\nCharge her rent and part of the cost of utilities. Encourage her to get a full time job. The reality of life is you have to learn to take care of yourself.  \n\nAsk yourself if the worst happened and you all passed away who would take care of Ann? Ann will have to so get her ready now.\n\nI raised 2 sons as a single parent.  My job was to raise them to be independent and take care themselves. I had a rule if you went to college you could stay with me if not get a job and take care of yourself. They've been doing it since they were 18. I'm a happy grandma to 6 grandkids now.", "INFO: Is Anne in school? What are her prospects for full-time work?", "INFO: it doesn't sound as if Anna is in college. What's her medium term plan for becoming economically independent?  If she doesn't have or isn't working toward one she should contribute now that she's a adult.  If she is progressing and your demand would slow her down recommend you shelve it.", "NTA.\n\nAnn is a grown woman, not a child. If she can pay for her car, she can pay rent", "Nta she an adult with a Job she should be paying rent and be gracious she's lived there rent free since leaving school", "NTA.  If Ann was in school, I would say she shouldn't have to contribute.  But, she is 22 and working.  It's time for her to have adult responsibilities.  Contributing to the household will be much more affordable for her than getting out on her own", "I'm confused. Is she in school? If not, is she working towards a certification or something? I just don't get what endgame is for her of she's working two low-paying jobs and living with her parents at 22. Does she expect to do so indefinitely? Is there some reason she can't live independently?", "Even after paying her phone and car , with working 2 min. wage jobs, she should have some money left. I imagine she doesn't spend much on food either so where does the money go ?\n\nShe is 22 years old working woman there is no need for her to live free anywhere but her own home. If she doesn't like it she can move out and find a better option.\n\nNTA", "NTA. 22 year olds can pay rent. There\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t.", "NAH, if you can\u2019t afford to buy a house without Ann paying rent then that is not the house for you because the moment tensions boil over which is highly likely once the new baby is born she will leave and stop paying rent. Now with that said, Ann is an adult and she does need to start making plans for the future and living on her own. I would sit down and look at her budget with her. See what she can afford to pay in rent each month, charge her that but put it in a savings account. After a year give it back to her so she has the means to move out and start a life on her own. This will in that year teach her to budget within reason and give her a nice nest egg to start living on her own because once your baby is born I promise she will start to have second thoughts of wanting to live at home with a new born and you do not want someone who\u2019s forced to stay there due to lack of funds. It will start to build resentment on both sides.", "NTA. Ann is a working adult and can financially contribute to the household. Her saying that you care more about an unborn child is unfair. You are not forcing her to be homeless unless you literally throw her out on the street.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. If she decided she wants to move out now, you wouldn\u2019t really even need to get another house for a while. So if she continues to live with you, she should contribute something.", "INFO \nIf Ann doesn't want to pay, would you buy another 2 bedroom house or stay in the current house and have her move out as soon as you don't want the baby in your room with you?", "NTA. You crunched the numbers, y\u2019all need some help and this is an opportunity for her to step up and help the family. I imagine you wouldn\u2019t be wanting to bleed her dry of money either, that she would have more money than if she had to find her own place", "NTA -  The only reason you need a larger house is because this grown adult is refusing to launch in any meaningful way.      If if she doesn't want to contribute to a joint household, she can move out and manage on her own.  You will then have a room for your baby and everything will be fine.", "NTA. She's an adult. You're making a generous offer allowing her to stay with you, probably for cheaper than she could find on her own. \n\nJust make sure you can afford the house if Ann moves out or stops paying rent or something. Really it would be cleanest if she moved out on her own at the same time you were moving.", "NTA\n\nShe should be contributing something. Maybe not market rate rent, but a portion of the utilities at least. That is the real world. Ann is not longer going to be the baby. And the real world will hit her in the ass at some point. Prep her now. She is 22 already. She doesn't want to go to college. Fine. It isn't for anyone, but does she have any long term plans?", "NTA. It is not unreasonable to expect and adult to contribute to the household. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re expecting her to contribute 1/3 but something reasonable within her earnings. I\u2019m not sure where in the world you are so not sure if culture play into it.  You\u2019re not replacing her or turning her mother against her, you\u2019re expecting her to start adulting and she\u2019s sounds rather immature for a 22yo", "Lol Ann is right\u2026it is OP\u2019s choice to have a kid and it\u2019s also their choice to not have to move to a bigger house to accommodate her.

So it is completely reasonable for her to chip in according her salary \nAbsolutely,she should already be contributing to food bills and possibly utility bills, since she is working... She is not a baby of family. If she doesn't want to contribute and you can't afford a 3 bedroom house. You will have to get a 2 bedroom house and she won't have a room to live in with you at all..

If her job van't pay for more then a car or a phone, she needs a beter paying one. or get a car that is a lott cheaper. \n\nused car per month: around 500. maybe public transportation is cheaper, depending on where she lives and where she needs to go. cheap phone should be 50. total 550. \nincome after taxes should be well over 1k. depending on hours worked. so at least 450 left. more acording to OP.", ">No, I\u2019m saying Anne\u2019s life with her Mom declined in quality significantly\n\n*How*?

It's so weird to see how many parents are fine with their kids staying put, and how many more kids are also fine and are doing it by choice/default/laziness. Zero effort on either side to push for more and change it - it's weird, right?", "[deleted]", "Ann is an adult, albeit a young one. I was still at home at 22, making I think less than $1k/mo with a younger sibling at home. Things were tight for my family and I contributed where I could but it was never expected. Had my parents asked me to pay rent, I would have because not only was I an adult, it also would have been good practice for renting when I moved out. Maybe the timing is unfortunate but it\u2019s not unreasonable to say \u201chey, you\u2019re an adult and we need you to start being an adult if you\u2019re going to continue living here.\u201d I don\u2019t see how that is a bad thing.", "Or they were trying to give her a reasonable amount of time to grow up before asking for rent?

OP suggest 500 a month. that is a steal compared to other options. so all she would otherwise spend more, she can still save. perhaps another 500 a month. 500\u00d7 30 months= 15k, about the minimum down payment, in less then 3 years.", "Literally none of what you wrote matters.\n\n\nAll of what you said is correct for while Ann lives there.

The OP would guilt her about purchasing a house so she has room etc...\n\nYou do NOT make forever purchases based on children's money. Your children won't always be living with you. If Ann's mom wants to always ensure Ann has a room. Fine. It isn't the right move because they can barely afford the 3 bedroom and Ann isn't going to stay and help pay their bills forever. That's why Ann shouldn't factor in their budget for a forever purchase.\n\nAnn should be paying them rent etc.\n\nThat is completely different than an independent couple making a big purchase banking on their adult child staying and contributing towards the house.", "You forgot to factor in gas and insurance, which is another $30 a week just for gas\u2026if she fills up once and her car gets decent mileage which working two jobs, she might need more than that. Which tells me you yourself probably don\u2019t pay for your own car.  Plus food if she wants to feed herself and pack lunches for work. If I\u2019m being generous and she scrounges, that\u2019s $30 a week. Suddenly we\u2019re at $770 out of the $1000 she supposedly makes, NOT factoring in how much insurance might cost, which varies based on where they live, her driving record, etc.  So now we only have 230 (and if she pays insurance it\u2019s less than that) left. And suddenly if and when the car needs new tires or maintenance, there\u2019s no room to account for that.", "Anne and her mom shared a house that was enough for them and they could afford with their lifestyle.  That is no longer the case due to Mom meeting, moving in and marrying husband.  Anne is 22, an adult but not by far, she\u2019s got learning challenges that limit her ability to develop a marketable set of skills without special effort and she had a 17 year old mom who may not have been the kind to beat the streets to find the novel treatments to help Anne learn.  So we have a young adult, who can\u2019t yet support herself (many people that age in the US say the same, can\u2019t speak for other countries), one parent whose focus and goal is no longer helping her.

No. Ann is having to realize that her mother and step father\u2019s lives are no longer going to revolve around her. Babies change everything and OP now needs to figure out how to provide for a new human. If Ann was 12 and throwing a fitb because she was being asked to take on chores to help out, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. From the sounds of it Ann doesn\u2019t have plans to leave.

They would rather pay $1500 a month to a landlord then give their parents $300 a month. My parent\u2019s response is they made their standards and rules clear on day one. If you let your adult child live rent free for a year or two with no expectations of contributing, they\u2019re going to make you out to be the bad guy when you finally ask them to chip in. Just like little kids don\u2019t like it when their parents change their rules, adult kids don\u2019t like it either.
