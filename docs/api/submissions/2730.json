It\u2019s okay to take a side every once in a while. If you want your husband to stay, say that. If you would prefer he leave for whatever reason, say that.

I was in a moment where I was willing to try anything, and honestly, can't worry about this while worrying about how to feed our baby!   \n Can you please drop this and be over it?\"   Say the same thing to anybody that gives you a hard time.   \n\nI was where you are, it is a very tough road and something not everybody can understand, especially how hard we can be on ourselves.

I luckily had the easiest latch-time ever, but saw so many others struggle and how heart breaking it was. Your head is not on right, and it can't be.

Instead, sticking up for her is...well, that's bad. Understandable because you've clearly tied all your confidence in breastfeeding to her help and are scared to lose that, but you cannot go on like that, and if she genuinely wants to help you she wouldn't want you to. After all, baby shouldn't starve for *her* ego.\n\nStop giving her a universal pass, apologise to hubby, and try to recognise that when you're succeeding, *you're* succeeding, not her. You can be grateful without being a doormat.", "ESH - \n\nhis cousin for being overly rude and accusing your husband of starving his child by being there with his wife.\n\nYou, because you are married to your husband, and it\u2019s your responsibility to stand up for your husband when he is being accused of letting his ego starve his son\u2026 do you get that?? His cousin accused him of starving his baby.  Read this again.  You should have said, hey cous, he is not causing a problem.  But you didn\u2019t.  And the. Afterwards, you continued to support his cousin rather than admitting that you made a mistake by not supporting your husband.\n\nYour husband because he should realize that you aren\u2019t going to support him when you are upset about feeding your child.\n\nYou need to apologize to your husband for not standing up for him.  You chose him, you made vows to put him first forsaking all others.  That\u2019s not about cheating, that\u2019s about not letting his cousin accuse him of starving his own child.  You broke your vow to him to put him first before others.\n\nYou need to tell his cousin that while you appreciate the help, she went too far when she accused your husband of starving your child by not leaving the room.  That comment was excessive and untrue, and you need to tell his cousin that.\n\nYou need to tell the whole family what you told the cousin.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do these things, your husband will never trust you again to support him, and the family will be picking sides on this issue for eternity or until your husband divorces you.  \n\nSo I strongly suggest, that you are the one that needs to fix this and you need to fix it with your husband first, because you are the one that broke your vow to him\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
