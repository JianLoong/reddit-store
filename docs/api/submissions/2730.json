There's this period of time when the baby and mom are both learning, and if this cousin was able to help you so you didn't have to go to formula, I can see you being forever grateful and wanting to follow her lead to the letter. But if your husband wasn't stressing you out, you should have just said, \"No, he's fine. He's not stressing me out.\" And it would have been over. \n\nAlso, it's INCREDIBLY weird to kick everyone out of a room. You either nurse with people there or go to another room.

There are many dynamics that go into finding solutions to breastfeeding problems. You may not be emotionally stressed out by having your husband there BUT many times the body knows what the mind and emotions don\u2019t. For some bodies, they need to fully concentrate on the tiny human in front of them to have early success in breastfeeding. No split attention. Later, when the routine is established, it isn\u2019t an issue. \n\nNo two people are alike, one size solution does not fit all and your cousin was trying to bring your body in to full attention on the little human. \n\nShe was pretty rude to your husband. I would have chosen better words, but I wasn\u2019t there to understand the dynamics.  Sometimes, that\u2019s what it takes.", "YTA this whole situation arose because you didn't communicate your needs to anyone. Your husband's ego wasn't starving his child.

She sounds self-important", "YTA you said your husband didn\u2019t make you uncomfortable so why didn\u2019t you say anything? Why didn\u2019t you defend him? Why let you his cousin disrespect him in his own home? You should Apologize to him. YTA", "YTA if he was not stressing you out. But I get it with all the hormones and you probably are tired and it is just easier not to talk back to others. Try to stand up for yourself. It is hard sometimes but it will get better.\n\nIf the breastfeeding is hard maybe you could let your babies tongue tie get checked. It was a huge problem for me a few months back when my baby was born. I got cracked and bleeding nipples and my baby could not drink properly. He had to stop a lot and drinking took ages. But with his tongue tie fixed and help from a lactation consultant we now are pros in breastfeeding. The consultant taught me another way to sit and breastfeed that was better for my body and boobs. Now my baby can drink properly and it does not take (literally) hours anymore. And my nipples are never painful anymore. If the lack of milk is the problem you could try pumping when you are done feeding so your breasts are totally empty. Then your body makes new milk easier. \n\nAnd remember, you are a great mom even if breastfeeding is too difficult and you have to stop breastfeeding. Don\u2019t feel guilty! You are doing great!", "As a woman who is currently breastfeeding their second child, when I first started with my oldest I was so overwhelmed at certain times because my nipples hurt so bad I wanted to cry, sometimes no matter how far I pushed into my baby's mouth he wouldn't latch, or he would scratch me so bad and press against my scars I would yelp out in pain and start to have an anxiety attack. There were times I would shut down because I was so overwhelmed. My husband recognized it and made everyone else go away and he would support me, but I would ask him sometimes to leave as well because EVEN THOUGH HE WASN'T THE ONE STRESSING ME OUT, I still needed to focus and calm down and do it myself. His cousin said just the right thing to get him to leave and yes he's hurt, but this is more important than his feelings. You're navigating new territory. This is overwhelming. You do need to have a heartfelt conversation with him and get him to understand how hard this is and that you're sorry he was hurt, but it was a necessary evil, so to speak. \n\nI don't think I can give a true judgement because this has too many complicated emotions that come along with it on both you and your husband.", "I think you need to be honest with your self. His presence was stressing you out and making it harder for you. He may have had the absolute best intentions by wanting to be there and support you but he was stressing you out because if he wasn\u2019t him leaving would not have helped.\n\nI don\u2019t think you meant for him to stress you out and I don\u2019t think he meant to stress you out. I think breast feeding was hard for you. I think having him there was making you feel like you where letting him and your son down. It was making you fail like a failure for not being able to do something that\u2019s suppose to be so natural. And usually the ones we love the most are the ones that we don\u2019t want to fail for. \n\nI think you need to have a genuine conversation and let him know he wasn\u2019t stressing you out but him seeing you struggle and fail at something was adding more stress to your body. It wasn\u2019t anything he did and it\u2019s not something you can control. When you give birth your emotions are everywhere. Hormones make you not react or think rationally.\n\nSo his cousin is right. Getting up leaving the room to try and breast feed probably where you didn\u2019t have the comfort was causing issues. Having everyone look at you waiting and watching you to see if your going to be able to feed the child was not good for you. He was a distraction at best. And you needed to focus. The cousin realized this. And you need to explain this to him. \n\nHe needs to quit letting his ego and pride get in the way and just be thankful for the help his cousin gave you. \n\nAnd by the way his attitude about how you needed to defend him and his cousin disrespected him in his house is very telling. He needs to get over himself and be thankful she was there to help. It doesn\u2019t mater if the help came in the way he didn\u2019t like it wasn\u2019t about him it was about you and the baby. And you need to tell him the truth.", "To be honest your husband would stress me out. Why does he have to make a big fuss over this? It sounds like you have enough on your plate with a newborn who isn't feeding easily. He needs to prioritise peace, quiet and harmony, not his petty sulks.  \n\nIt seems to me that your cousin was picking up on some genuine vibes.", "Massive YTA. I am a woman and yet it worries me how often I see mothers excluding and/or reducing the father\u2019s role. He has just as much right to your child as you do. It should be an equal partnership with open communication and decision-making. If he was stressing you out during breastfeeding, that is a different conversation. But the cousin should be definitely not have been involved and you were very much the AH for not only allowing her to be part of the conversation, but to actively defend her over your husband. \n\nYour husband was accused of neglect and you did not stand by or defend him. Nothing in your post suggests he has neglected your child. This accusation is dangerous and frankly disgusting. I would be ashamed of both you and the cousin.\n\nI worry not only about your marriage moving forward but on how your poor decision making will impact the paternal bond your husband has with his child. \n\nYou should massively apologise to your husband, tell your cousin in law to butt out of your family situation and work on co-parenting your child as a family unit. Being a mother does not automatically give you the right to lone parent your child. Remember that. Sometimes, the father is the better choice. As far as this post goes, he has never falsely accused you of neglecting your own child.", "But was he stressing you out? Did you have an easier time after he left? You talk all around the answer to that question. You're not being honest with someone, I assume because you don't want to cause problems. But look!

Instead of being mad because he was disrespected in his house because his cousin was rude. And is demanding an apology. Shows he is controlling. Who cares. The only thing that maters is the cousins helped mom and baby. Instead of being hurt hurt because he is the man of the house and shouldn\u2019t be treated that way he should be saying thank you for helping my wife out during a difficult time.

Sounds like cousin was able to give you tips/tricks and probably has experience with the hubby couch advice syndrome (hey honey have you tried X, I'm not gonna actually try and help you in other ways while I sit here watching football or figure out what you've already tried but I'm so smart so try it!), Hence the kicking out of the husband.", "YTA\n\nYou allowed the cousin to accuse your husband of something he wasn't doing. You stated in a comment that he wasn't stressing you out. \n\nHe was helping you out, by getting everyone to leave. He is your support person, he is the one who is going to be around when cousin is not, he should have been allowed to stay and watch what was happening so if it happened again he could help. Especially since he wasn't the one who was stressing you out.\n\nBut instead you allowed her to accuse him of starving his child, be disrespectful to him in his own home, and didn't speak up and say anything. And now you won't apologize.\n\nYes you are the one who gave birth and has to breast feed, but he is just as stressed, as you are, this is all new for him too, and it sounds like he is trying to be a great father and husband and help out. \n\nApologize to the man, and stop taking up for the cousin.", "NTA. You know damn well he stresses you out. And now it's worse. Tell them the truth, they all stress you out and it's affecting you and the baby. Screw everyone elses feelings. You need to worry about you and the baby.", "NTA either your husband was stressing you out and didn\u2019t want to be honest because you didn\u2019t want to deal with his reaction or you didn\u2019t want to deal with backlash from contradicting the cousin when she was helping you. \u201cIn his own house\u201d it\u2019s your house too and it seems like the priority should be feeding your son.", "YTA, why not say that it's alright that he's there?

Having someone watching while another is helping you with the nitty gritty of breastfeeding technique can add stress although while you are trying to feed the baby you may not recognize it.  And it ABSOLUTELY can distract the baby.", "NTA. You asked your cousin for help. In order to help you she asked everyone to leave the room. Your husband didn\u2019t want to leave, picked a fight with his cousin, and they brought you into it. \n\nThe cousin could have said it was easier, more comfy for her to teach you 1-on-1 and not making a big event of it by moving to a separate space might make the process easier for you. But it\u2019s easy to think that way since I wasn\u2019t apart of the convo. The comment about his ego while a low blow became a self-fulfilling prophecy imo. He cared more about having his man of the house rights respected/winning an argument than trying to explore a newly presented solution to feed your baby.\nShe didn\u2019t have to say the ego thing and your husband didn\u2019t have to continue to pick a fight/drag you into it. You didn\u2019t pick a side and told the truth when asked personally and then disengaged. You\u2019re NTA. I think it\u2019s noble that you defended her method (albeit aggressive) if it did work for you! Hopefully your family can set aside the personal quabbles that happen when there\u2019s a new member in the family.\n\nI\u2019m sure personalities are at play here based on the end of your post, but as a new dad he\u2019s gotta be the bigger person when it comes to things that can help you and the new baby.", "YTA -- it wasn't really your cousin's place to say this, it was yours.\n\nBut what about your husband's presence makes this hard or stressful, because that's more to the point.", "YTA\n\nYour husband left because he thought he is stressing you out, which is honestly a good sign from him.

When it should have been about the baby. He's still making it about him. And everyone else thinks his feelings are more important than the baby. His presence wasn't necessary.

However, OP has compounded the problem by being trying to avoid confrontation and letting the cousin be the bad guy to your husband. I am going to take a guess here but new mum/feeding issues/exhaustion, you were overwhelmed. You did actually want your husband to leave the room but you don't want to hurt his feelings. Your cousin in law had made some helpful suggestions that made a difference and you wanted to try everyone leaving the room. You already feel like a failure and having anyone watch you, including him feels like pressure (this is why your cousin in law asked your husband to leave too). It is not his fault and he hasn't done anything wrong. It is just you are barely holding it together for yourself and needed some space. Parenting is really hard and you need his support. That means he needs to stop being angry at cousin in law. You know he wanted to be your pillar of support and if he could have helped you, he would have. But he couldn't. OP has breasts and she didn't know what to do either (just to be clear, this is simply making a point to the husband. I needed help with breastfeeding for the first time and would never criticise anyone for struggling). Your cousin in law stepped in and saved the day, even if her methods hurt his feelings. So can he please let this go for your sake because you have been really struggling. You actually need to tell him this if it is correct because he needs to know.

You need to be honest about how he is making you feel.", "YTA", "Info: when it was just you, baby, the cousin and your husband\u2026what was your husband doing? What specifically caused the cousin to kick him out? Or did she kick him out immediately after everyone else left?", "Lame ass take", "L take", "Trying to breastfeed a new born can be incredibly stressful. And it is an extremely important thing. It's unfair to put expectations on the mother of anything other than feeding the kid. And, oh, even that, is okay to use a bottle and formula.", "That was my take. He now has to prove he is not stressing out his wife by creating this very stressful situation. I think OP said No because she knew it would be worse if she said \"Yes, you were stressing me out.\"", "Exactly- if it helped his child get the feeding and nutrition then get over yourself and also note that the cousin didn\u2019t say anything about his ego starving the baby until he refused to go/listen - he probably is stressing her out unconsciously if that\u2019s his attitude btw OP so NTA", "YTA for defending her. My partner is a lactation consultant and one thing she would never do is demonize the partner.", "NAH \n\nYou were focused on feeding the baby. Your cousin was focused on helping you feed the baby. You let your cousin take charge and I think that\u2019s okay, you needed help. Be gentle on yourself.", "YTA for not defending your husband when he was not stressing you out. He got accused for neglecting his child's need when that was definitely not the case. Massive AH. Grow a spine and be good to your husband!", "YTA. Why? You lied to your husband. \n\nEvery time a woman takes her breasts out infront of another person there is stress.", "YTA for having the cousin speak for you and not communicating with your husband\n\nCommunicate with your husband, he shouldn\u2019t have to talk to you through the cousin.\nFrom your explanation it seems like you\u2019ve used the cousin as support system to the point your husband is left to the side.\n\nHe\u2019s the father, if he\u2019s being detrimental to your mental health you need to tell him. From his pov he probably now has to go through the cousin to speak to you.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to be left alone but there is currently 3 people in your marriage and at some point one is gonna have to leave. Settle this situation NOW before things spiral.", "NTA. He may not have been stressing you out or you might not have felt like he was stressing you out but it sounds like whatever the cousin did helped. I\u2019ve always felt like my guy was a super calming presence in my life but it took until having his child to realize that sometimes having him around actually stresses me out more. I tend to be so dependent of him that just having him around can be a distraction to all three of us. I had to make him leave the room for almost the first whole month of breastfeeding. I would go with nah because I can understand why he might have been upset but the fact that you are now successfully breastfeeding should have chilled him out.", "NTA. I don't think it actually matters if he specifically was stressing you out or not. I think what really matters is that you were stressed out in general and struggling. The onus should not have been on you to play mediator in that moment. Cousin might have been a little over-zealous but the intent was to support you in navigating a difficult task. I think your husband should be more focused on that than anything else right now, in particular because this is for your son, but also because breastfeeding is a particularly draining and emotional task for new moms and there's a lot of mom-guilt that we experience when we struggle with it. His ego might not have been starving your son but it's hardly productive or mature to be whinging over his hurt feelings right now either.", "yta - to yourself. bc clearly if your husband stresses you out, you need to speak up! you are the mother now and need to be strong for the baby.\n\nif cousin exaggerated and husband did not stress you over, then why defending him?\n\nyou leave the fact you are so timid you are afraid of confrontation. make yourself a grace and think if you wanna stay with controlling husband for the rest of your life or if it is worth it to be silent if you do have a problem but you are afraid to face it.", "NTA your husband sounds like a stressful lunatic honestly. Berating you instead of helping g, thinking of himself instead of helping. And then stirring the pot with his family who has nothing better to talk about.", "NTA: she asked him repeatedly to leave and he refused until she bought up that he is starving his baby. If he wants to stay that badly he can help and let cousin leave instead", "Cause if husband was actually stressing her out all she had to do was say yes. \n\nHe\u2019s upset because as the father he was forced to leave when he wasn\u2019t stressing her out, and despite op saying so to him and to us, she still allowed the cousin to say that he was and to be rude. It\u2019s pretty understandable for him to be upset by that.", "She said she told her husband that he wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t clarify if that was the truth or she was just placating him.", "It's not even really his pride or ego, op says in the post hubby asked her later if he was stressing her and she says no he wasn't so why did the cousin demand he leaves his own home, I'm sure he's grateful for the cousins help but kicking someone out of their own room when they aren't even causing any stress if wrong", "I had a baby last week. Aside from having trouble breastfeeding, doing things like walking and bending and getting in and out if chairs is really hard right now because I feel like someone took a sledgehammer to my pelvic region. I lost  lot of blood and my labor was almost too fast and high impact. Not every pregnancy ends this way, but just know that physically for some new moms, being asked to go to another room/set themselves up in a new location with all of their things like nursing pillows, warm compresses water bottles etc might actually be an excruciatingly hard task. I was a reasonably fit, active mother of a toddler 8 days ago. Now I'm a woman with inflamed stitches who has trouble getting off the couch without being driven to tears by the pain, occasional losing bladder control.\n\nAnyway, I get where you're coming from, but hosting after a major medical event is a lot different than normal hosting.", "But she did, she did phrase it every possible way and he didn't listen. She didn't start throwing the punches right off the bat.\nThe fact was that the child was not getting food and at that very moment the husband was the reason. \n\nYeah if you were the husband you would throw her out and the kid would keep starving. Great fucking parenting, you get a fucking parent of the year medal.\n\nBreast feeding a child is an ordeal. You either don't understand what it takes or never had problems with your own. I've seen mothers go psychotic because their child wouldn't eat.", "\"Aggressively getting in her face\". Did I miss some comments in the thread that indicates that husband was aggressively getting in her face? The original post certainly doesn't say anything about that.", "Cannot believe the audacity of the cousin to speak to your husband like that in his own home. Nasty person on a power trip.", "YTA. I was looking for a comment from OP saying if the husband stressed her out or not. And he did in fact NOT stress OP out. So big AH for not speaking up. You need to apologize to your husband and the cousin too, because what they said was way too toxic.\n\nAlso I find it interesting that cousin wouldn't stress OP out, just everyone else. Maybe cousin with their behaviour was just the most stressful thing. If you want quiet while breastfeeding that's ok, but either your partner is welcome or no one is.", "It\u2019s tricky because lord knows when you\u2019re struggling to breastfeed it\u2019s difficult and complicated on so many levels, physical and emotional. So kudos that your cousin really helped you out with it and I totally understand why you\u2019d want to defend her after she\u2019d helped you out with something that is a major major thing for many women. But if you truly weren\u2019t stressed with your husband then at least afterwards (if you weren\u2019t able to in the moment), I think you could have just thanked her for being concerned but told everyone that it\u2019s fine for your husband to stay and he hadn\u2019t stressed you out. Also accusing him of starving his baby is a but strong - I highly doubt your baby was anywhere near starvation (you certainly didn\u2019t say that anyway). I imagine that would have deeply hurt your husband and you need to stand by him in disagreeing with all that. So maybe soft YTA for not doing that afterwards when he\u2019s getting so much flak.", "*He wasn't stressing me out, the situation/pressure was. I'm defending her because she still helped me even though her methods have made her unpopular in the family*\n\nYTA..simple..so is the cousin..\n\nYour husband wasn't doing anything but be in the room..why he also needed go be kicked out and spoken to the way he did was wrong. You sitting there not saying anything, was an encouragment the cousin needed to talk shit to your husband..disgusting..now you continue to support her when you're just as much to blame..YTA 100%", "YTA \n\nYou let a person wholly uninvolved in your relationship accuse your husband of causing literal physical distress to his own child and you said nothing.\n\nImagine how shitty he feels. Not only can he kot help with feeding cos you're breastfeeding, but also being told that just being around his wife and his child is distressing for them.\n\nSort it out.", "YTA,\n\nyou demand him to be with you while pregnat, help you take care your son after birth and yet you let someone kick him out his house. MAJOR ASSHOLE", "I mostly expect new parents to completely space some things while focusing on the baby. She could've very well not been processing the moment the best while trying to get ready to feed their baby.\n\n The YTA judgement from me comes from  her defending the cousin because it just doesn't make sense. It was an incredibly rude thing of the cousin to insinuate and it's rude-r to not offer some sort of proper apology (or explanation) to her husband. \n\nEither way,I hope OP is able to wrap up their little debacle soon.", "Your cousin is stirring the pot and you can't see it. She is manufacturing conflict and stress in the family with the pretense of helping you. How did starting an argument and insulting your husband de-escalate the situation or make you less stressed?? Has your family being mad at YOU because of her made you less stressed?", "She has clarified in her one post that he was not but the situation was. It seems like cousin-in-law caused the situation by going mad with power.", "If she can\u2019t clarify that point in her own Reddit post, you have to wonder how reliable she is as a narrator", "She is doing as much as bad as good. She seems to enjoy creating drama and conflict. Hardly seems very helpful for op. She is making everyone in her life angry when her purpose was to make her less stressed.", "Oh for fuck's sake - she's an overwhelmed new mother with a baby that wouldn't latch but was screaming for food! That's enough to push anyone off-centre. Why would anything be normal at that time?!", "Have you considered that maybe it was the conflict that the cousin started that was stressing her out? I\u2019m sure she breastfeeds with her husband around when nobody else is there.\n\nThe fact that the baby started feeding after the husband left doesn\u2019t mean that the husband was starving the baby \u2014 especially if the cousin was getting confrontational with the husband to get the husband to leave. Even raising their voice could have stressed the baby out. There\u2019s more than one asshole here. The husband should have asked his wife if she wanted him there and obeyed her wishes. The cousin should have remained calm and not overstepped.", "No, the stressful situation existed prior to the cousin asking everyone to leave. Cousin didn't ask that out of nowhere; she asked it *because* OP was struggling and couldn't feed baby.", "He has to \u201cprove\u201d? No he got accused to wanting to starve his baby! This not some macho move. This is a new father getting bashed and being made to feel like crap. His wife told him he didn\u2019t stress her out so now he feels betrayed and abused. He doesn\u2019t have to \u201cprove\u201d crap. The cousin needs to learn some manners!", "How did he create a very stressful situation? It was the cousin that started the confrontation with him and that likely would have stressed the wife and baby out as they did not want to deal with an external conflict and just wanted to feed. The cousin could have remained calm and collected and asked the wife if she wanted her husband present instead of speaking for her and making baseless accusations while at the same time engaging in a confrontational manner.", "Maybe the husband just didn\u2019t want somebody else speaking for his wife? He\u2019s probably been around for way more feedings than the cousin. The cousin could have remained calm instead of escalating with the husband and ultimately let the mother speak for whether she wanted more privacy or not. Having someone speak for her and engage in argument on her behalf likely would have been more stressful than just allowing her husband to watch. It may not have been the husband leaving that allowed her to feed \u2014 it could have been that the husband decided to be the better person and disengage from the confrontation and the resolution of the situation resolved her stress. Her husband did not start that confrontation \u2014 his cousin did.", "Except that OP specifically said that she was struggling to feed her child in the beginning and nearly gave up - the implication is that this wasn't a one-off but her struggling to do it at all. And cousin helped her figure it out. Which means that husband being there in the past hasn't helped.", "Agreed. My husband rarely stress me, but in an allready stressfull situation - hungry crying baby and struggling to latch.. Yeah my husband really felt stressfull in that mix, even if he didnt really say or do anything wrong. \nThe only time one of my babies and i really landed the breast feeding deal, was when we were alone in the bedroom.\n\nAnd the chanse are, thats it's not worse than that. He didnt do anything wrong, but when feeding is hard, it's just nice to not have people watching", "I\u2019m very well versed in the world of nursing both personally and professionally. Was there a comment somewhere that there was no letdown until he left?", "Absolutely. The long-term health of OP\u2019s relationship with her husband (AKA the baby\u2019s father) is completely irrelevant in this situation- these men with their egos! Good grief.\n\nAnd cousin is totes justified- after all, OP herself told husband he wasn\u2019t a stressor, but then decided to make an AITA post where husband is painted (very, very vaguely) in a bad light. He should be dismissed from his child\u2019s feeding time! Bad husband. Cousin should start the divorce proceedings immediately", ">And if OP\u2019s husband was aggressively getting in her face demanding that she tell him if he\u2019s stressing her out?\n\nI too like to make things up. But there are fiction subs for that.", "Where did you get the aggression or tantrum from? I\u2019ve seen one response from OP that clearly states he was not a stressor therefore I\u2019m replying under the assumption that he was not stressing her out, being aggressive, or throwing a tantrum. Lactation support people, conversely, can be very aggressive and have a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d attitude. It seems more likely that the cousin decided everyone needed to leave and OP really wanted/needed her help so she acquiesced to her demands. Cousin should\u2019ve included the husband because it\u2019s his baby too, he was/is a supportive partner (based on the story), and he needs to be educated as well."]}
