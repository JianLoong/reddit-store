Prior to this, my stepsister (29F) Rachel's (now) fianc\u00e9 Matt informed my parents that he was going to propose and asked if it would be okay to do it at the party, and my parents agreed. For the party, everyone was dressing up, and obviously (to me) I was wearing my engagement ring. Everybody already knew I was engaged but it was the first time they'd seen the ring in person, so at the start of the party, everyone was interested in seeing it. I did notice Matt was being a bit cold with me but I thought it was nerves. \n\nThe proposal happened and it was beautiful. Everyone congratulated Rachel but it was kind of a 50/50 on people wanting to look at and compliment her ring and mine. A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind, and everyone was really happy for Rachel, as was I.\n\nThe day after, Rachel and Matt blew up about me wearing my ring to the party. Rachel said I was deliberately trying to draw attention to myself on her special night, and that since I knew beforehand she was getting engaged I shouldn't have worn my ring, since I don't always wear it anyway. I don't really agree with this, since I've been engaged for weeks, and everyone already knew about it, it's not like I stole her thunder, nor did I intend to by wearing my ring. I wore it because I'm engaged so it's what you do. Matt then accused me of embarrassing by wearing my \"colossally large\" ring when I knew Rachel's wouldn't be anywhere near as big, and intentionally showing him up in front of the family. He even went on about the other jewellery I wore.\n\nMy stepdad called them both stupid for their outburst. My stepbrother says there's no way I could have known that's how they'd feel, it's not like they asked me not to wear it. My mum says while she knows I didn't do it deliberately she can see where Rachel is coming from since everyone preferred my ring to hers.

How many of your friends and family relatives attending your engagement parties/ weddings are engaged or already married themselves is your sister going to call them out for that too?

Let's try one more time.\n\nHere is OP's **original post**:\n\n>I (28F) got engaged at the beginning of December.\r  \n\r  \nFor Christmas, I was staying with my mum and stepdad, and they were hosting my stepdad's whole family (stepsiblings, mother, brothers, cousins + families) for a New Year's party. Prior to this, my stepsister (29F) Rachel's (now) fianc\u00e9 Matt informed my parents that he was going to propose and asked if it would be okay to do it at the party, and my parents agreed. For the party, everyone was dressing up, and obviously (to me) I was wearing my engagement ring. Everybody already knew I was engaged but it was the first time they'd seen the ring in person, so at the start of the party, everyone was interested in seeing it. I did notice Matt was being a bit cold with me but I thought it was nerves.\r  \n\r  \nThe proposal happened and it was beautiful. Everyone congratulated Rachel but it was kind of a 50/50 on people wanting to look at and compliment her ring and mine. A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind, and everyone was really happy for Rachel, as was I.\r  \n\r  \nThe day after, Rachel and Matt blew up about me wearing my ring to the party. Rachel said I was deliberately trying to draw attention to myself on her special night, and that since I knew beforehand she was getting engaged I shouldn't have worn my ring, since I don't always wear it anyway. I don't really agree with this, since I've been engaged for weeks, and everyone already knew about it, it's not like I stole her thunder, nor did I intend to by wearing my ring. I wore it because I'm engaged so it's what you do. Matt then accused me of embarrassing by wearing my \"colossally large\" ring when I knew Rachel's wouldn't be anywhere near as big, and intentionally showing him up in front of the family. He even went on about the other jewellery I wore.\r  \n\r  \nMy stepdad called them both stupid for their outburst. My stepbrother says there's no way I could have known that's how they'd feel, it's not like they asked me not to wear it. My mum says while she knows I didn't do it deliberately she can see where Rachel is coming from since everyone preferred my ring to hers. She also said that given that my ring is quite unique, I should have considered it would draw attention.\n\nPlease quote from me ***the portion of that post*** the additional context of when she wears or doesn't wear her ring. I'll wait.\n\nYou can't, because it doesn't exist in that. Now, let me quote myself:\n\n>If OP is providing additional context in other responses, it's not really a fair expectation that anyone is somehow supposed to know to check for those additional posts. **This subreddit is designed and intended for users like me to read the top post and provide a judgment based on those facts.** I did so. And in doing so, I directly quoted and used appropriate context to render my decision.\n\nThis is my final response on this matter. Feel free to continue downvoting me. But my point is pretty clear. And, I think, inarguable with someone who has good intentions. You seem inclined to argue for the sake of arguing. I really don't have the time or interest in that.", "Yet again, you are choosing to make assumptions and add hypothetical context to OP's description to represent it in the most favorable light possible. \n\nWhat OP **actually said** was she chooses not to wear the ring sometimes, and chooses to wear it other times. There are, as you've said, plenty of good reasons not to wear a ring. Hell, I take my wedding ring off pretty often - when I'm doing yard work, when I'm cleaning, etc. So it's not like I'm unaware of the possibility of choosing to take your ring off.\n\nOP's initial post was, at best, ambiguous as to the reason she chooses not to wear her ring. In light of that ambiguity, it's not unreasonable or unfair to interpret her post as saying she simply chooses not to wear her ring some days and wear it other days. If that's the case (which, again, is reasonable given the lack of clarity in the original post), it's reasonable to conclude that it was an AH move to wear the ring the night of the engagement. \n\nYou and anyone else are free to choose to interpret OP's initial post differently. But let's not pretend that there's only one reasonable conclusion to be drawn from what OP wrote. Anyone who makes that claim is simply trolling for an argument.", "I have answered this elsewhere. Apparently you are as guilty as me for not knowing to check other responses of mine to see my response to this.", "Oh dear. Poor chap with me misunderstanding.", "As previously stated, I pulled it from one of her comments on the post threads.\n\nRich of you to start insulting other people's reading comprehension when you continually fail to comprehend the same message repeatedly \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "As it has been pointed out to you already, OP has answered in which circumstances she wears and doesn\u2019t wear her ring.", "Lol, that was my first thought too- ahh yes you just haven't made bread yet, but you can learn", "Do people who post here all agree not to really read the posts they are responding to before writing a response? Or maybe you are all posting here because you feel the need to be \"right\" more than anything. And so therefore this is the perfect place because you get to feel superior and morally justified, which is something you really yearn for.\n\nWho knows. I'll let others wax philosophic on the reasons people like you have such abysmal reading comprehension. \n\nTo put it in a way you might understand: as I've already pointed out, OP didn't include the necessary context for when she wears or doesn't wear her ring in her original post. Adding additional context changes everything. My entire response pattern is based on (and limited to) only the facts and context OP felt necessary to include in her original post. Anything she's posted elsewhere does not factor into my analysis or conclusions. Why? Two reasons. First - as I've already said, this subreddit is based on the idea that someone posts a scenario, provides all necessary information (as they see it), and we render an opinion on their behavior based on those facts. OP didn't do that here.\n\nThe second reason is that it's entirely possible for OP not to get a response she wanted and add context in subsequent posts which will help her get the reaction/judgment from people that she wants. In my opinion, the only fair basis for evaluating posts like this is to limit the analysis to what OP says in their first post.", "It's such a baker mindset--that's what I thought too!\n\nWhich reminds me, I need to start the dough for kardemmumabullar ;)", "INFO:\n> A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind \n\nComparisons were made to your ring?!\nWho made these comparisons and how did you react and respond to them?", "NTA.

Hahahahah I mean now I get why they're so peeved \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Lmao this isn\u2019t real", "Whether it is an attention puller depends on the stone.  If it\u2019s a diamond or sapphire that size, you should absolutely be aware that people may react to it.    \n\nIn this case, no big deal, you were with family, and it caused nothing more than some comments people likely regretted, and some envy, which you should be able to smooth over.  \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 earns a remarkable amount more than your stepsister\u2019s, you may have to be more diplomatic if you want to avoid putting a wedge between the two of you and isolating yourself.  The same thing can happen with your friends as well.  \n\nThere are reasons that smart people with money are more careful with their manners, less trusting with flatterers who run their mouths, and oddly eager to stay close to old friends and family members who do not flatter.", "Or if OP sets a date that\u2019s *oh so significant* that stepsister *must* claim it as her own, and schedules her wedding for the same day! And that will also be OP\u2019s fault, even if OP sets the date first, because clearly OP will have been flaunting the perfect date when telling people!", "On Grey's Anatomy that couple would fasten their rings to their shirts with a safety pin. That's a good idea for the easily distracted folks, such as myself. \ud83d\ude01", "I have a birthstone ring that I wear fairly regularly and is similar to an engagement ring in some ways (solitaire stone, though not a diamond). I take it off whenever my hands are going to be in anything...goopy or otherwise. Raw meat, cookie dough, anything oily (I'm more of a cook than a baker, but it can still be a pain to clean a ring)...you get the idea. It's just practical to not want to clean it after handling that stuff!", "It could be a lab-created diamond too, which could cut the cost down to \"only\" high five figures.", "Kinda have to agree. You can\u2019t possibly exist in the world of the internet and not know a 7 ct Diamond with a pave band isn\u2019t excessive even for most multi millionaires.", "You\u2019re reiterating what I just said. But I\u2019m calling OP an AH for enjoying the negative comparisons towards Rachel & standing there doing nothing not trying to redirect the conversation. Seems like OP is perfectly ok being compared to others as long as she\u2019s on the winning end. She\u2019s N T A for wearing her ring to the party but she\u2019s YTA for allowing extended family to compliment her at the expense of her step-sister.", "I'm thinking of the old 80s Apple commercial where they are all dressed in the same grey uniforms in the auditorium.", "I understand that reference.", "Vonnegut in the wild. Rare, that.", "<<smell of lilacs and rainbows.>>  Would that be when Rachel was passing gas? Or belching?  <Wink>", "She probably only smells like wet dog and disappointment.", "I gotta wonder how small and unimpressive Rachel's ring was that all of OP's other jewelry outshone it.", "God forbid she dress up for a fancy dinner", "How is OP supposed to know about comments being made to Rachel or between other people???\n\nShe answered the questions and moved on. **The family later made comments to Rachel, so how can any of this have been predicted??**\n\nThis wasn\u2019t malicious or intentional and it\u2019s not OPs fault that her ring is bigger or that people perceive it to be nicer! She was at the party to celebrate, people did celebrate Rachel, but they also made comments on their own that **OP cannot control** and making it up his problem and instead of telling those family members that they were in the wrong is absurd.\n\nShe has no accountability or control over the words of other grown people. **Rachel should be mad that her family took her moment and decided it was an opportunity for comparison. A comparison the OP never invited, encouraged, or even knew about until the blow up.**\n\nSomeone gave her a compliment, she said thanks. End of interaction. How could she know that that thanks would turn into her being used in this game of comparisons as a pawn by family members? How is she at all enjoying this additional attention that she did not invite by saying thanks *before anything happened*???", "Centre diamond would be 120-250k US depending on quality looking at online prices. Only would be 7 figures if it's perfect and there's some other special circumstances (such as a high margin jeweler).", "It's also abrasive (the clay) and will wear down the settings and you can lose the stone. Personal experience", "Thanks for the links. Winter in my area, time for bread baking. Too hot to run the oven in summer, oven and AC having a desperate fight, not good for power bills."]}
