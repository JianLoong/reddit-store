Prior to this, my stepsister (29F) Rachel's (now) fianc\u00e9 Matt informed my parents that he was going to propose and asked if it would be okay to do it at the party, and my parents agreed. For the party, everyone was dressing up, and obviously (to me) I was wearing my engagement ring. Everybody already knew I was engaged but it was the first time they'd seen the ring in person, so at the start of the party, everyone was interested in seeing it. I did notice Matt was being a bit cold with me but I thought it was nerves. \n\nThe proposal happened and it was beautiful. Everyone congratulated Rachel but it was kind of a 50/50 on people wanting to look at and compliment her ring and mine. A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind, and everyone was really happy for Rachel, as was I.\n\nThe day after, Rachel and Matt blew up about me wearing my ring to the party. Rachel said I was deliberately trying to draw attention to myself on her special night, and that since I knew beforehand she was getting engaged I shouldn't have worn my ring, since I don't always wear it anyway. I don't really agree with this, since I've been engaged for weeks, and everyone already knew about it, it's not like I stole her thunder, nor did I intend to by wearing my ring. I wore it because I'm engaged so it's what you do. Matt then accused me of embarrassing by wearing my \"colossally large\" ring when I knew Rachel's wouldn't be anywhere near as big, and intentionally showing him up in front of the family. He even went on about the other jewellery I wore.\n\nMy stepdad called them both stupid for their outburst. My stepbrother says there's no way I could have known that's how they'd feel, it's not like they asked me not to wear it. My mum says while she knows I didn't do it deliberately she can see where Rachel is coming from since everyone preferred my ring to hers. She also said that given that my ring is quite unique, I should have considered it would draw attention.", "created_utc": 1672762999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102c8tc/aita_for_wearing_my_engagement_ring_when_i_knew/", "score": 956, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's try one more time.\n\nHere is OP's **original post**:\n\n>I (28F) got engaged at the beginning of December.\r  \n\r  \nFor Christmas, I was staying with my mum and stepdad, and they were hosting my stepdad's whole family (stepsiblings, mother, brothers, cousins + families) for a New Year's party. Prior to this, my stepsister (29F) Rachel's (now) fianc\u00e9 Matt informed my parents that he was going to propose and asked if it would be okay to do it at the party, and my parents agreed. For the party, everyone was dressing up, and obviously (to me) I was wearing my engagement ring. Everybody already knew I was engaged but it was the first time they'd seen the ring in person, so at the start of the party, everyone was interested in seeing it. I did notice Matt was being a bit cold with me but I thought it was nerves.\r  \n\r  \nThe proposal happened and it was beautiful. Everyone congratulated Rachel but it was kind of a 50/50 on people wanting to look at and compliment her ring and mine. A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind, and everyone was really happy for Rachel, as was I.\r  \n\r  \nThe day after, Rachel and Matt blew up about me wearing my ring to the party. Rachel said I was deliberately trying to draw attention to myself on her special night, and that since I knew beforehand she was getting engaged I shouldn't have worn my ring, since I don't always wear it anyway. I don't really agree with this, since I've been engaged for weeks, and everyone already knew about it, it's not like I stole her thunder, nor did I intend to by wearing my ring. I wore it because I'm engaged so it's what you do. Matt then accused me of embarrassing by wearing my \"colossally large\" ring when I knew Rachel's wouldn't be anywhere near as big, and intentionally showing him up in front of the family. He even went on about the other jewellery I wore.\r  \n\r  \nMy stepdad called them both stupid for their outburst. My stepbrother says there's no way I could have known that's how they'd feel, it's not like they asked me not to wear it. My mum says while she knows I didn't do it deliberately she can see where Rachel is coming from since everyone preferred my ring to hers. She also said that given that my ring is quite unique, I should have considered it would draw attention.\n\nPlease quote from me ***the portion of that post*** the additional context of when she wears or doesn't wear her ring. I'll wait.\n\nYou can't, because it doesn't exist in that. Now, let me quote myself:\n\n>If OP is providing additional context in other responses, it's not really a fair expectation that anyone is somehow supposed to know to check for those additional posts. **This subreddit is designed and intended for users like me to read the top post and provide a judgment based on those facts.** I did so. And in doing so, I directly quoted and used appropriate context to render my decision.\n\nThis is my final response on this matter. Feel free to continue downvoting me. But my point is pretty clear. And, I think, inarguable with someone who has good intentions. You seem inclined to argue for the sake of arguing. I really don't have the time or interest in that.", "Yet again, you are choosing to make assumptions and add hypothetical context to OP's description to represent it in the most favorable light possible. \n\nWhat OP **actually said** was she chooses not to wear the ring sometimes, and chooses to wear it other times. There are, as you've said, plenty of good reasons not to wear a ring. Hell, I take my wedding ring off pretty often - when I'm doing yard work, when I'm cleaning, etc. So it's not like I'm unaware of the possibility of choosing to take your ring off.\n\nOP's initial post was, at best, ambiguous as to the reason she chooses not to wear her ring. In light of that ambiguity, it's not unreasonable or unfair to interpret her post as saying she simply chooses not to wear her ring some days and wear it other days. If that's the case (which, again, is reasonable given the lack of clarity in the original post), it's reasonable to conclude that it was an AH move to wear the ring the night of the engagement. \n\nYou and anyone else are free to choose to interpret OP's initial post differently. But let's not pretend that there's only one reasonable conclusion to be drawn from what OP wrote. Anyone who makes that claim is simply trolling for an argument.", "I have answered this elsewhere. Apparently you are as guilty as me for not knowing to check other responses of mine to see my response to this.", "Oh dear. Poor chap with me misunderstanding.", "As previously stated, I pulled it from one of her comments on the post threads.\n\nRich of you to start insulting other people's reading comprehension when you continually fail to comprehend the same message repeatedly \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "As it has been pointed out to you already, OP has answered in which circumstances she wears and doesn\u2019t wear her ring.", "Lol, that was my first thought too- ahh yes you just haven't made bread yet, but you can learn", "Do people who post here all agree not to really read the posts they are responding to before writing a response? Or maybe you are all posting here because you feel the need to be \"right\" more than anything. And so therefore this is the perfect place because you get to feel superior and morally justified, which is something you really yearn for.\n\nWho knows. I'll let others wax philosophic on the reasons people like you have such abysmal reading comprehension. \n\nTo put it in a way you might understand: as I've already pointed out, OP didn't include the necessary context for when she wears or doesn't wear her ring in her original post. Adding additional context changes everything. My entire response pattern is based on (and limited to) only the facts and context OP felt necessary to include in her original post. Anything she's posted elsewhere does not factor into my analysis or conclusions. Why? Two reasons. First - as I've already said, this subreddit is based on the idea that someone posts a scenario, provides all necessary information (as they see it), and we render an opinion on their behavior based on those facts. OP didn't do that here.\n\nThe second reason is that it's entirely possible for OP not to get a response she wanted and add context in subsequent posts which will help her get the reaction/judgment from people that she wants. In my opinion, the only fair basis for evaluating posts like this is to limit the analysis to what OP says in their first post.", "It's such a baker mindset--that's what I thought too!\n\nWhich reminds me, I need to start the dough for kardemmumabullar ;)", "INFO:\n> A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind \n\nComparisons were made to your ring?!\nWho made these comparisons and how did you react and respond to them?", "NTA.
