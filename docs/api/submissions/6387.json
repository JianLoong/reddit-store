Prior to this, my stepsister (29F) Rachel's (now) fianc\u00e9 Matt informed my parents that he was going to propose and asked if it would be okay to do it at the party, and my parents agreed. For the party, everyone was dressing up, and obviously (to me) I was wearing my engagement ring. Everybody already knew I was engaged but it was the first time they'd seen the ring in person, so at the start of the party, everyone was interested in seeing it. I did notice Matt was being a bit cold with me but I thought it was nerves. \n\nThe proposal happened and it was beautiful. Everyone congratulated Rachel but it was kind of a 50/50 on people wanting to look at and compliment her ring and mine. A lot of comparisons were made, nothing unkind, and everyone was really happy for Rachel, as was I.\n\nThe day after, Rachel and Matt blew up about me wearing my ring to the party. Rachel said I was deliberately trying to draw attention to myself on her special night, and that since I knew beforehand she was getting engaged I shouldn't have worn my ring, since I don't always wear it anyway. I don't really agree with this, since I've been engaged for weeks, and everyone already knew about it, it's not like I stole her thunder, nor did I intend to by wearing my ring. I wore it because I'm engaged so it's what you do. Matt then accused me of embarrassing by wearing my \"colossally large\" ring when I knew Rachel's wouldn't be anywhere near as big, and intentionally showing him up in front of the family. He even went on about the other jewellery I wore.\n\nMy stepdad called them both stupid for their outburst. My stepbrother says there's no way I could have known that's how they'd feel, it's not like they asked me not to wear it. My mum says while she knows I didn't do it deliberately she can see where Rachel is coming from since everyone preferred my ring to hers. She also said that given that my ring is quite unique, I should have considered it would draw attention.", "created_utc": 1672762999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102c8tc/aita_for_wearing_my_engagement_ring_when_i_knew/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way people knew about your engagement and expecting you not to wear your ring is ridiculous. Good luck with wedding planing, I can see a lot of upcoming similar issues", "NTA They are being childish. The thing that *really* would have given you all the attention would have been you not wearing your engagement ring. Ignore them, if they are insecure about the rings or that desperate for attention then that's their problem.", "NTA. You are engaged, it is normal for you to wear your ring especially at family occasions!\n\nWhat's next--can you not bring your husband to their wedding because any reminder that anyone else has ever gotten married would be upstaging their day?", "Um so NYE belongs to Rachel?

Your stepdad is right.\n\nNot everything in this world needs to be about the bride.  Also, you're also about to be a bride.  You have the same right to show off your engagement ring as she does.

But your post makes it extremely clear that you only sometimes choose to wear your ring. \n\nSee:\n\n>Rachel said I was deliberately trying to draw attention to myself on her special night, and that since I knew beforehand she was getting engaged I shouldn't have worn my ring, ***since I don't always wear it anyway.*** I don't really agree with this, since I've been engaged for weeks, and everyone already knew about it, it's not like I stole her thunder, nor did I intend to by wearing my ring. I wore it because I'm engaged so it's what you do.\n\nYou can't say that you're wearing the ring because it's \"what you do\" when you also mentioned in the same post that you don't always choose to wear the ring. You can't have it both ways.\n\nWhether it was intentional, subconscious, or simply a mistake on your part - you were an AH by wearing the ring when you don't always. You should apologize to Matt and Rachel for being insensitive and inconsiderate.", "Nta.", "NTA why would you hide your ring? No one does that.

It\u2019s just a bloody ring at the end of the day anyway.", "NTA. He knew you were engaged when he arranged the proposal. It was his decision to do it while you were there.

Your stepdad is completely right that their reaction was completely childish and immature. They are creating drama for no valid reason.", "I think NTA but I\u2019m curious why you don\u2019t wear the ring normally? I suppose it\u2019s a bit like never announcing you\u2019re pregnant and then going to a wedding and suddenly everyone realizes it and makes a big deal of it there, or essentially coming out at a wedding by showing up with a same-sex partner. It\u2019s their right, but it would\u2019ve helped the wedding couple a lot if they\u2019d make those announcements or press the word prior to the event.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you the A H because it\u2019s your ring and you obviously have the right to wear it, but if you\u2019d worn it earlier so that your family could see it, then not as many party attendees would\u2019ve been so quick to compare rings and say yours is better, etc. I do just see it from their POV of having to share the spotlight and get rings compared (and theirs compared negatively, of course).", "NTA\n\nYou're engaged, so you're entitled to wear your ring now - fancy or not fancy.\n\nBut I can see your step-sister point of view too.  I wonder if you two were close as step siblings or if there was rivalry there and it's showing up here at this event.", "Nope, NTA. You have every right to wear the ring.", "NTA, they sound unhinged. Good stepdad.", "NTA op your not upstaging anyone here both you and your sister are engaged that\u2019s what should be the most important thing here it\u2019s NOT a competition on who\u2019s engagement ring \ud83d\udc8d is bigger than the others. How many of your friends and family relatives attending your engagement parties/ weddings are engaged or already married themselves is your sister going to call them out for that too? Plus I think both your sister and future Bil know that they couldn\u2019t afford the biggest ring now matter how much they wanted. I think you\u2019re bil just did that to save face cause he\u2019s probably thinking that your sister would call off the engagement because he too cheap to buy her the most beautiful biggest expensive ring \ud83d\udc8d out there. And if that happens, then they will try and blame you for their engagement ending, that\u2019s sad and pathetic because the most important thing is that they\u2019re getting engaged. It doesn\u2019t matter the size of the ring cause I know for a fact if, and when I ever get engaged, I don\u2019t care what the ring size is what\u2019s important is that my future partner Gave me the ring in general and I would cherish that engagement ring for the rest of my life. Both your sister and your future bil need to grow up again it\u2019s not a competition on who\u2019s ring is bigger. The important thing is that you\u2019re getting engaged and if they\u2019re willing to cause drama over who\u2019s ring is better they\u2019re gonna lose a lot of people if they keep this up.", "NTA - You are engaged, you wore your engagement ring.

The whole business of whose shiny rock is more special really doesn't appeal to me at all, but I could understand why some people really care about it and what they represent.

Ask your mom if she plans on not wearing her wedding ring to Rachel's wedding (or your own wedding).
