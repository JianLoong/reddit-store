Not assault, either.  \n\nLike I said -your reaction is pretty overwrought, you're working hard to build a mountain out of a mole hill.\n\nI feel like you are projecting, son.", "An absolute menace some would say... I'll see myself out", "Did I at some point argue that respect doesnt go both ways?\n\nAnd what? Lol... all i said was his dad took care of him for 19 years, the kid could return the favor a little... commendable? What??\n\nMy point is, literally having a 19 year old of my own, is they are going to tell their story in a way to make people feel sorry for them, even if it isnt accurate.", "[removed]", "Poor OP wasn't even late, he said it was 09:05 after he napped for a few minutes. So when the incident happened, it wasn't even 09:00 yet \ud83e\udd79 Dad is a jerk", "I have a 19 year old and know that his stories sound a lot like this 19 year olds stories. Inaccurate.\n\nI just ripped my 19 year old's xbox out of his room b/c he isnt doing his household duties. Next step is he can find a new place to live.\n\nKids today dont have the respect for others as we did at their age. He is 19, cant get up on his own, cant keep a job, and slacks off on what little chores he has. When I was a kid I knocked my chores out without question.\n\nMy son has it made compared to what I had growing up. I expect the same respect towards others at his age that I had. I expect him to be mature enough to get up on his own and knock out his chores without me having to ask daily.\n\nYou ask him and his story would be wildly different, yet what I wrote above is the actual truth.\n\nI have never dumped water on my child, but bet that the reasonings behind OPs fatger doing so were more than he let on.", "Waking up with water poured on your head is one of the best ways to wake someone up", "Yea thats good and all and would have worked 20+ years ago when I was a kid.\n\nSadly, kids today lack respect and everything is too cumbersome for them. \n\nBut you said it best. He is 19 and free loading off his father (remember, he is an adult at this point). If he cant follow his fathers rules, maybe he should find a new place to live?

Congratulations for you and as I've said numerous times. Not condoning the actions taken.  But it could explain why they're acting worse.", "Sorry. I understand. You are right.", "I'd say its the opposite. Too many are treated abusively and it gets blown off because the don't know any differently. They don't know that they deserve better and they end up tolerating abuse from a loved one.", "Damn you're that rattled by my post ? I'm sorry you exist.", "This is absolutely abuse. It\u2019s a little scary that you think it\u2019s not.", "Dumping water on someone's head while they are asleep is ABSOLUTELY 100% ABUSE!!! AND ASSAULT!!!     Please don't ever have children.", "it's not \"returning the favour\", you're supposed to take care of your children. if i was helping someone and they threw water on me because of their own mistake and then didn't have the decency, or have enough respect for me, to apologise, I wouldn't want to do any favours for them.", "if their parents are abusive and don't give them respect, absolutely. you don't have to suffer assholes just because they chose to take you into this world.\n\n\nI'm not having children because I recognise I'm too selfish/mentally ill to give a child a good thriving environment to become mentally healthy and independent. I lose my temper a lot.

What an absolute piece of sht you have for a father.", "This tells me that he has just been DYING for you to miss the alarm by even a second for a while now so he could abuse you in this way.

You are worthy of being respected and loved.", "Please edit this in the OP, this is critically important info.", "What I do with my phone, cause I have it on my bed when asleep, is I get it to 100 just before I sleep and then it will stay at that level or only drop 1 or 2% throughout the night not being used", "No, it really isn't.\n\nHonestly, I'm hoping you never bred, either.", "His dad didnt throw water on him for lack of help, but lack of following the rules of the household.\n\nJust like my 19 year old. I pay the bills, not him. He follows my rules or he can find a new home to live in. I have no problem with him living with me as long as he needs, but he will follow my rules while he does so.\n\nIf OP was supposed to be up by 9 and wasnt, thats on him. Time to mature a little and act their age. And of course OP says this happened before 9, but can you prove OP is telling the truth and not just overblowing the situation into their favor like any other 19 year old would do??", "Huh??

Lord only knows what other abuse this poor kid is being subjected to.", "well it's not exactly respectful?\n\n\n\nedit: there's more types of abuse than straight up beating your child. throwing water at people is considered assault, the reasons the dad threw the water show he is controlling, quick tempered, and does not respect his child. bad parent.", "So he doused you with water because he got annoyed by an alarm he set and he refuses to apologise for it. Well we certainly got a dad of the year contender so early.", "And I'm certain it would be nowhere near that high a number.", "You sound 12, though, so - don't care.", "Oh, heavens, the poor baby!", "[removed]"]}
