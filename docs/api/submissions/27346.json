Based on the description calling it porn seems like an exaggeration when the real thing is you just want attention from her in the morning especially after making her breakfast. You guys could compromise, seems like. Either you don\u2019t make her breakfast, or you share a coffee together (or whatever) without screentime and she wakes up doing her own thing? Idk, I like nighttime for family time catch up myself and mornings for quietly easing into the day. Your not wrong in your preference either though. Maybe let her wake up first and have time with yourselves then together, if possible. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be flexible if it\u2019s a compromise.", "I feel like this is going to be a biased answer.....but I'm not a morning person...you are not going to get me to talk much....I have a question..if she wasn't reading \"porn\" but still reading books in the morning would it be a problem?\n\nYou too have different ideals when it comes to breakfast.....it seems", "ESH  What makes it porn? I\u2019m a reader and some books will have more sex than normal in them, but there\u2019s a lot more to the story. I think you\u2019re wrong to try to push your gf into breakfast always being a special time, seems like she\u2019s not a morning person. \n\nShe should tone down the reading and you should tone down trying force a family breakfast every morning. But it\u2019s not normal that you are jealous of the characters in the book, it reeks of insecurity.", "I'm going with ESH, but only because you insist on calling the fanfic you dislike \"porn\" when that's not really accurate. You're disparaging something you don't understand and that's not okay. Though I don't think you'd really have such a problem with it if your GF hadn't made it one...\n\nYour GF is being rude and disrespectful by ignoring you during a meal you specifically made in order to spend time with her. Maybe instead of saying \"stop reading porn at breakfast\", you could try being honest. Something like, \"Starting the day by connecting and spending time with my partner is very important to me, and it hurts me that you're ignoring me after I put all this effort into making you a nice breakfast. I feel disrespected and disconnected from you. I'm not asking you to stop reading something you love, I'm asking you to give me-- the person you love-- an hour of your time and attention in the morning.\"\n\nETA: honesty is always going to get better results than attitude.", "ESH Your issue is that she's reading at the table. You admit it's not always a fic with sex and if it it was always fluff it would still be an issue. Focus on what's bothering don't try to insult what she's doing or try to make it seem \"worse\".\n\nYou've expressed that you want to talk during breakfast and she's either ignoring you or not communicating what she is feeling.", "soft YTA. first if the two of you bonded over griddlehark, then it doesnt look nice when you are kinda berating that content. now coming to the question of breakfast, you mentioned yourself that she isnt a morning person and doesnt see the same level of importance of breakfast as you do. while i understand how you feel, maybe you might want to try and create some other tradition where its a family time rather than breakfast.", "YTA\n\nBreakfast is the way you start the day.  But for a lot of people having to talk and be social that early in the morning sucks. It will start the day out *wrong*.  Maybe not full day ruin but augh.  \n\nYour wake up process isn\u2019t more valid than hers.  However, as yours requires another person, it does take back seat.  Two yeses or it\u2019s a no scenario.  \n\nTry a single brunch occasionally, late enough no longer an issue, and request no phones but as an occasional special thing.  Not a default-that makes it just another meal not a \u201cdate\u201d", "I'm bordering ESH. Not all fanfiction is \"porn,\" and you acknowledge that, yet you still refer to what she is reading as\" porn\" to justify your jealousy. Don't get me wrong, there is some material that can fall under that category. In some ways, I can understand you wanting your partners full attention. I get the same way sometimes with my fianc\u00e9, u/clowningAnarchist when they are playing Tears of the Kingdom. There is a feeling in your chest of \"this is OUR time together. Why can't I have your attention?\" \n\nHowever, it's important to express this in the moment as some people just feel content existing in eachothers presence. Still, whenever I see certain characters on the screen, I don't feel jealous of pixels on a screen because at the end of the day, they aren't real. There seem to be some underlying problems that you have overall that need to be addressed.\n\nAlso, are you telling her specifically her \"reading porn at the breakfast table is bothering you\" because that could be taken as her just not needing to read explicit content at the table\n\n. I've tagged my fianc\u00e9 in this to hopefully see what their take is on this... probably two different perspectives, but I figured a relationship of a fanfiction reader and a non fanfiction reader couple would be an interesting perspective.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot my fianc\u00e9 got banned. Maybe I'll for some reason. I'll add what they said when I ask, though, and add it to my post.", "ESH. it seems like fanfiction isn\u2019t the issue here. you said it yourself that your girlfriend isn\u2019t a morning person and breakfast isn\u2019t important to her, so obviously she\u2019s going to do something comforting during that time to wake herself up. she shouldn\u2019t be ignoring you though, definitely voice your concerns to her and tell her that you\u2019d like her to limit her screen time when you spend mornings together. \nwhat you shouldn\u2019t do, however, is make her out to seem like some sort of porn addict just by reading fanfiction. not all fanfiction is porn and saying that about her is a really low blow. \nyour feelings are valid for feeling ignored, but it seems like you two need to compromise and maybe spend your time together in the mornings doing something else.", "Well, it is a bit weird. You could ask her if she could limit her screen time when wkth youm there are actually apps that help woth that if she has a problem laying her device to the site. \n\nHowever, you would not get any conversation out of me in the morning, either. Maybe she is just not someone who wants to speak at the morning (that is why newspapers exist :p ). So for that ... YTA maybe? Like it might be that, and not the fanfic at the morning.", ">However, breakfast is an important \"family\" meal for me and it sets the tone for the entire day.\n\nIt's clearly not to her. If this is something that goes as far as making you jealous of fictional characters, I'd have a frank conversation with her that this is impacting your relationship. \n\nUltimately, she may decide that she doesn't even want to be awake for breakfast. A lot of people skip that meal entirely. If this is a massive problem for you, then you clearly want to different lifestyles and maybe just aren't as compatible as you'd think. \n\nNAH Either one of you could choose to make the sacrifice for the good of the relationship, neither seem to want to.\n\nAlso reading fan fiction does not equal reading porn. I don't think most people would call reading 50 Shades of Grey as reading porn, and fan fiction is often the same way. Stories can contain explicit content without that content being the primary driver/purpose; not sure exactly what stories she's reading but I think this is still worth saying.", "YTA. Not everybody likes to be social at breakfast. How about finding something to read yourself and leaving your girlfriend alone until she's had her coffee?", "Yta, \n\n1) by the sounds of it she probably wasn't even reading porn \n\n2) she probably doesn't hold breakfast to the same sentiment as you do. \n\n3) stop judging your partner and shaming her for it", "ESH. reading fanfic doesn't mean she is reading porn all the time, and you referring to it like that will probably make her feel belittled. on the other hand, it doesnt matter what shes reading, sitting on her phone through breakfast is rude of her, especially if she knows its improtant to you", "YTA. This is important family time to you - it is half asleep waking up time for her. And all fanfic isn't porn - is a song of ice and fire porn because it has sex scenes in it?\n\nImagine if she was trying to have intimate conversation time right before you were winding down for bed and while you're half asleep. It's annoying. She's not a morning person, and this is just part of her morning routine - why don't you make lunch or dinner a special time, when everyone is actually awake and functional?", "You are totally fine with the ship and enjoy the fandom, but when you get upset that your GF is reading fanfic instead of paying attention to you, you dismiss it all as \u201cporn.\u201d  That\u2019s not really a good look.  Speaking as someone who reads fanfic, although I\u2019m not in this particular fandom, there\u2019s a pretty broad range of stories, and even the romantic stories aren\u2019t automatically porn.  Or they are several chapters of slow-burn romance with maybe one graphic sex scene, similar to a romance novel.  I guess those are also porn?  She might respond better if you don\u2019t dismiss what she is reading, since it sounds like the issue is not WHAT she is reading, but the fact that she is reading at the table.\n \nPersonally, I think this is a NAH.  Breakfast is an important family meal to you, not to her.  She may be someone who prefers quiet time on the morning.  Personally I\u2019m slow to wake up and I like some alone time to drink some coffee and not have talk to anyone.  Also, is she willing to talk to you as she reads?  A lot of people look over the paper in the morning while also talking to their loved ones.  When I visit my parents my mother and I will pass the crossword back and forth while also occasionally chatting.  What kind of fascinating breakfast conversation are you offering that your GF needs to out the phone down and focus only on you?  Is the phone thing a common problem, or does she give you her full attention at other times of the day?", "Yta, especially for calling it porn when it isn't", "YTA.. you told her sounds like no discussion but trying to control what she does. Jealous over the book because you want everything about you and your wants. You need to have an adult conversation with her and listen, hear her side. Also she may be too busy during the week and the weekend is her chance to enjoy her personal activities. If you allow breakfast to dictate your life.... that's sad. Relationships are a 2 way street! Don't force your wants on her unless she has asked for changes from you. Then you both need to compromise. Give and take 50/50.", "I didn't understand any of that info, I clicked because it said gf reads porn lol....I will say this, some people prefer NOT to talk at meals. I am definitely a non talker at breakfast. I don't wanna hear shit or say shit. My advice would be to talk about this, but NOT as it's going down. Mention it later in the day", "Me and my partner have a thing called \u201cself time\u201d where if we\u2019re not in a space to be chatty and engage, we can say \u201cI\u2019m having self time\u201d and the other will leave us alone for a bit, no hard feelings. My partner is introverted and needs a lot of time alone to recharge, and this system helps me not feel rejected and offended. I can also use it if I\u2019m overstimulated. Maybe this would help you.", "Has she ever been a morning person? Maybe she likes to sit quietly whilst she's trying to wake up..... I know for sure I don't want to be having a big ol' chat whilst I'm half asleep! Leave me to scroll on my phone please!", "Yta  talk to her about maybe compromising ho you conduct meals and phone", "Me personally, I will go as long as I can not talking in the morning. Dunno why, I just prefer to stay quiet while everything is still quiet. Conversation in the morning is not my forte. Shes reading at the table and that bothers you. Dont peg it as porn to seem more justifiable. Days can be stressful enough, maybe hedge ur expectations better so mornings are not as strife-filled for you.", "YTA. Not everyone likes talking in the morning, it sounds very much she prefers quiet", "NTA. I\u2019m a big reader and I encourage all reading, smut included. I, however, would never consider pulling out a book - either physical or ebook, during a meal. I think people who stare at their phones when others are around are rude. I also don\u2019t understand how reading is somehow less mentally draining for a non-morning person than chatting over breakfast. I would focus on the screen time to face time disparity and less on the \u201cporn\u201d.", "You've been together 6 months you aren't family.\n\nIt's great that you thing breakfast is important but it's not to everyone, I rarely even have breakfast myself.\n\nHave you asked them about this stuff when they aren't reading, do you know if they \"value\" breakfast.\n\nThere could be so much worse that you have to deal with other than my gf reads a shit ton of fanfics", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s not about the fic, it\u2019s about how you\u2019re making the effort to connect with her and do things for her, especially making breakfast early which is a labor of love, and she\u2019s not responding to any of those bids for attention. I think you should have a sit-down conversation where you explain that you feel unvalued and ignored, and maybe schedule some time you can spend together without phones or doing something specifically together, even if it\u2019s not breakfast. \n\nAnd honestly, I\u2019m shocked at the popular response here! You guys wouldn\u2019t be mad if you made a meal for your partner and they just stared at their phone and didn\u2019t talk? Feels like people are getting defensive about their own fanfic habits.", "LMFAOOOO first of all I'm gonna thank you because this is SO funny and I had to send this to my friend who loves The Locked Tomb. As to the vote I guess I'm going with NAH. I'm also so used to reading ff's that I don't even register that I'm reading porn around ppl (mostly bc in my head it's just a \"oh aight, they fucking\") so I get your GF. I'm also not a morning person and well, not everyone wants to talk in the morning. But from what you said it seems like you have busy lives and want to spend more time with her, so well, I can get that. I think you need to sit down and talk and just say that you love her and just would like to spend more quality time together", "NTA Your girlfriend's behavior is disrespectful and frankly, it's embarrassing. Reading explicit content at the breakfast table, especially when you've expressed your discomfort, is incredibly insensitive. It's not about being petty; it's about basic courtesy and prioritizing your partner over fictional fantasies. She should be ashamed of her actions.", "NTA\n\nI'd wonder whether she was trying to get in the mood for some morning entertainment, but apparently she really is just sitting there reading porn to herself while ignoring you. Which is just odd and rude.", "NTA. It feels like you should have a convo about this and seriously discuss what you like. It\u2019s all cool she\u2019s into this genre, but it doesn\u2019t matter what it was, if it\u2019s consuming her time and you two don\u2019t get a chance to connect, it\u2019s a problem.", "NTA. Stop fixing breakfast for her.", "NTA just ask her if she could not have her phone at the breakfast table. When we're eating any meal we have a no mobile phones rule- unless we go out to eat, we can take a picture of the food then put phones away so we are engaged in table conversation", "NTA but I don't think it's about what she's reading. Staring at your phone while you're supposed to be enjoying a meal with your partner is rude and childish. It could be scrolling through fb - same difference. There's a time and place, and what should be quality time together isn't it.", "NTA it is rude to read something (even if I dont know if it is porn or no) next to someone. You should not make breakfast for her if she wants to have time to wake up.", "Stop making her breakfast.  Seriously.  And tell her why.  If she can't do that one thing for you (put down the phone), why should you make breakfast for her?  You're not asking her to move mountains, you're asking her for no screen time during breakfast.  To be honest, it doesn't matter what she's reading to me so much as it's rude to be glued to the phone at  the breakfast, lunch, or dinner table.\n\nIt's honestly a low  bar.  NTA", "I don\u2019t even care what content she\u2019s looking at, get off your damn phone and spend quality time with your partner! NTA.", "Sad to say but it\u2019s only going to get worse.  So many people can\u2019t unleash themselves from their phones.  I see so many people at restaurants sitting across from each other and they are both on their phones the entire time.  It\u2019s ridiculous, talk to each other.

Doesn't help that they've deleted several of their comments in the comment section.", "Lmao your comment had me snorting.", "doh!", "How is that ableist? I never said you shouldn't provide accommodations for them if their autism leads them to act this way. Like, if your gf never got out of her seat, ever. Like you never saw ever get up, her legs either don't work or she's super lazy. If her legs don't work, provide accommodations, it they do tell her to use them.", "honestly you have it spot on haha i genuinely have no problem with what she reads, to the point we've applied ship dynamics from the fanfics to our intimate life which is very good, really! but i think you're right about me being accusatory i suppose i get riled up over her not thinking breakfast is as important as it is to me", "I mean fanfiction on AO3\u2026 depending on the story porn might not be that far off. No hate or anything, I enjoy smutty fan fics, but there are a lot that are all smut no plot (which author usually expresses in the story summary lol).  \n\nSo could be an exaggeration\u2026 could be spot on.", "What heteronormativity does to a fool's reading comprehension.", "AITA because this made me LOL?", "He also says it\u2019s not always Porn, he only knows she\u2019s on Ao3.  Lots of assumptions.\n\nAnd honestly so what if it\u2019s a smutty book or the newspaper, she isn\u2019t ready to be social in the morning, she isn\u2019t ready", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Honestly if there was porn that reminded me of my guy, I\u2019d love watching/reading it in the mornings before he\u2019s gone all day lol, but they make it hard to search for male descriptions in straight porn, one of my biggest annoyances with it lol. You can search for women\u2019s descriptions all day but can never just be like: \u201cstocky tan guy with glasses missionary\u201d or whatever (this is fictional, not mine specifically) and not get man on man lmao", "It's so subconscious lmao.", "Uh, do I want to know what that word means?", "true but also another reason why I am mad is because this is our 1 time a week (rarely 2) when we can have breakfast together so until having breakfast tgt is normal I feel like i'm always gonna consider it special and not want her attention divided", "It\u2019s a concept that\u2019s been around forever; nothing too complex \u2014 \n\nit\u2019s basically the idea that society\u2019s default is to speak in totally heterosexual terms (i.e. always presuming a relationship is male-female even if it\u2019s not; only ever using photos of male-female couples on your wedding planner website because you\u2019ve never considered anything else could possibly be an option; etc.)\n\nIt\u2019s just a term that points out how societies generally frame heterosexuality as the exclusive reality, given its statistical ubiquity, as opposed to a context-dependent reality.", "I think that\u2019s fair! And I think it\u2019s an example of compromise if she can do that for you once or twice a week. Although some people are just incapable of not being grumpy in the morning lol so I hope it works out for you, good luck :)"]}
