I have a son (16m) that I've been raising myself for the past 6, and he has been struggling with anorexia for the past 3 years. And he told my girlfriend he is anorexic so i don't understand why she is so upset.\n\nAnyway, here's what happened, my girlfriend decided to make us all dinner, and when my son didn't eat any of it, she came and told me that she was worried my son stopped eating again. I told her not to worry because he had a smoothie \n\n(information about my son. There are some days that he struggles more with his ed than others, and on some of those days, he can't, so he'll drink a special smoothie that is a substitute for a meal) \n \nWhich she does know about but she still looked upset, so I asked her what was wrong, and she said she felt disrespected because my son knew that she was making dinner didn't even bother to try it. To be honest , I just stared at her. I didn't know what to say, and she told me I should punish my son from not eating her food and being disrespectful. I said \"have you lost your mind I'm not punishing my son because he didn't eat your food and if I punished him for something I told him is ok that might mess up months of progress and I'm not doing that\" .\n\n(and by something that I told him is ok, meaning if he doesn't feel like he can eat, he doesn't have to as long as he drinks one of those smoothies) \n\nThankfully, my girlfriend hasn't said anything to my son, but she still thinks I should punish him and honestly because she told my mum and she saying I should punish him as well maybe I am in the wrong.\n\nSo Reddit AITA", "created_utc": 1678436845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11njb62/aita_for_not_punishing_my_son_because_he_didnt/", "score": 856, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After about two months of this treatment, I stopped eating in front of him entirely. I know he and my mom had arguments about it. I started eating in the middle of the night when everyone was asleep. Secret eating. I also started sleepwalking. Finally, I just couldn't eat in front of other people. Took me YEARS to get over that.

She did a kind thing and she was trying to be a good human but sadly his ED means he isn\u2019t capable of giving her the thanks I expect he wanted to give. I expect that on some level he wanted very much to thank her and eat the meal and enjoy food with the two of you but he just isn\u2019t well enough for that yet and it sucks.

No desserts until you've had a meal.  If she wants noodles and butter. Go for it. I try to encourage her to have a smoothie to make up for veggies she might not be getting.

But if the choice is a snickers bar or not eating at all? I'm gonna eat the damn snickers and I refuse to feel badly about that.", "I respect your feelings on it. I hate food waste, too. So much! \n\nMy husband was in prison for 2 years (before we got married) and starved the whole time. He was indigent so he didn\u2019t have extra food. He has big issues with food insecurity bc of it and still occasionally binge eats when the memories flash up. The thing that helped him the most over the last 8 years was to not talk about it at all. If something got wasted it wasn\u2019t brought up. \n\nWe adopted a 13 yr old 5 yrs ago (she\u2019s almost 18 now!) and she came from a very food insecure home. She hoarded food, couldn\u2019t share it at all, just absolutely *freaked* out over food. Worse off than my husband when he got out of prison. Again, we didn\u2019t address the food at all. We let her hoard- only rule was that it had to be shelf stable foods bc of rot- and we didn\u2019t make her share. We bought her her own plates and cups and everyone knew not to touch them. We bought her totes for the food storage. I think she was drugged through her food bc she\u2019d always freak out if she put something down and it left her sight. Again, we didn\u2019t put any emphasis on food at all. It took her about 2 years but she was finally ready to let go of her hoard. We took it to her bio mom\u2019s house. And now she can share food. She doesn\u2019t binge. She\u2019s going to be OK. She still ASKS \u201cCan I have some dinner?\u201d though even after 5 years. Not breakfast or lunch, just dinner. There\u2019s still something there that she\u2019ll have to work out with her therapist when she\u2019s ready bc it\u2019s definitely above my ability to help her with. \n\nIt was imperative for us to treat it as morally neutral. We had to remove all shame, expectations, rules- everything. They taught me a lot about food and it benefited the other kids in a very positive way. I managed to raise kids with a healthy relationship with food and that\u2019s not easy to do. ;) \n\nI do think it\u2019s morally neutral, though, bc when you attach feelings to it it makes it a moral issue. Food waste is not OK but the minimal amount most homes do isn\u2019t the problem- it\u2019s the corporate food waste that\u2019s the issue. Restaurants, grocery stores, Starbucks, etc. It\u2019s also an industry problem- like the millions and millions of chickens we had to kill a few months ago bc the bird flu or whatever spread through the egg farms. \n\nWhen we take on that responsibility in our homes it can give our kids big issues with it.", "You're still wasting food if you're eating it when you're not hungry and have no nutritional reason to eat it (i.e. you've eaten enough calories/protein/fat/vitamins/etc. for the day)", "Ok.
