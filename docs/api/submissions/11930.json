I have a son (16m) that I've been raising myself for the past 6, and he has been struggling with anorexia for the past 3 years. And he told my girlfriend he is anorexic so i don't understand why she is so upset.\n\nAnyway, here's what happened, my girlfriend decided to make us all dinner, and when my son didn't eat any of it, she came and told me that she was worried my son stopped eating again. I told her not to worry because he had a smoothie \n\n(information about my son. There are some days that he struggles more with his ed than others, and on some of those days, he can't, so he'll drink a special smoothie that is a substitute for a meal) \n \nWhich she does know about but she still looked upset, so I asked her what was wrong, and she said she felt disrespected because my son knew that she was making dinner didn't even bother to try it. To be honest , I just stared at her. I didn't know what to say, and she told me I should punish my son from not eating her food and being disrespectful. I said \"have you lost your mind I'm not punishing my son because he didn't eat your food and if I punished him for something I told him is ok that might mess up months of progress and I'm not doing that\" .\n\n(and by something that I told him is ok, meaning if he doesn't feel like he can eat, he doesn't have to as long as he drinks one of those smoothies) \n\nThankfully, my girlfriend hasn't said anything to my son, but she still thinks I should punish him and honestly because she told my mum and she saying I should punish him as well maybe I am in the wrong.\n\nSo Reddit AITA", "created_utc": 1678436845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11njb62/aita_for_not_punishing_my_son_because_he_didnt/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How can you punish him for something that's not his fault?  NTA and your girlfriend needs to educate herself", "NTA. You realise that your girlfriend is making your son's eating disorder about her, right? How do you see this affecting your son in the long term? It's also worrying that she has you second guessing this because your initial response is exactly how you should have reacted.

That is, until my dad decided to comment on each and every bite. He'd say things like, \"Oooh, that forkful's going right straight to your fat ass.\" Every single meal. After about two months of this treatment, I stopped eating in front of him entirely. I know he and my mom had arguments about it. I started eating in the middle of the night when everyone was asleep. Secret eating. I also started sleepwalking. Finally, I just couldn't eat in front of other people. Took me YEARS to get over that. I'm 67 years old now, and to this fucking day I can't stand for others to remark about what's on my plate. I'll shut down. What your gf is doing will have repercussions thoughout that kid's life. Don't stand for it.", "NTA, you need to have a serious conversation with your GF about your sons ED. She doesn't seem to understand the implications and effects her train of thought will have on your son.\n\nWhile in some situations her opinion might be warranted. For example someone slaving away in the kitchen for hours to make a special dinner and the person you make it for eats right before it's ready. Still would not punish someone over it but probably have a conversation about it since it's disrespectful. This, however, all goes out the window when a person has an ED where the goal is just to make sure that person eats at all. Pretty much your GF doesn't understand the severity of the ED and is judging the situation based on a normal situation, still over the top with the punishment.", "NTA. You must protect your son from your girlfriend and his grandmother at all costs. They're batshit", "NTA. You follow the advice of his therapist(s) and doctor(s). Fuck what your mum says, fuck what your girlfriend says. This is his life they are stupidly playing with.

Until well into his adulthood at least.", "NTA Oh boy, trying to force an anorexic child to eat then punish them for not being able to. This is not only unacceptable but is incredibly dangerous for your child. DO NOT ALLOW that woman to bully or abuse your child! If she is too self  centered to get it through her skull,  then she has no business being around him at all. Please OP, put your son first, he needs you. Break up if you have to.", "I agree. The relationship you have with food is very important. Pushing someone to eat, disturbs this relationship and might cause someone to throw up or stop eating altogether.

Fortunately my mom wouldn't put up with it, but I learned how to make myself throw up on that trip. \n\nOP is so NTA", "I appreciate the phrasing of food being \"morally neutral.\" It clicked for me. \n\nWhile growing up-- food was never used as punishment, until my former stepmother used food as this power play & I didn't really \"get\" it then. I began to resent food/eating (not to the point of developing into an ED, thankfully), but it tipped food out of this \"morally neutral\" concept. \n\nI became vegetarian as a way to feel like I had control over my own food again (21 years later, I'm still vegetarian haha). \n\nBut it took a long while to shed the emotionally negative connection that I developed towards food, and I think you are spot on in your comment that:\n\nFood is off limits. Aside from modeling healthy eating habits, it should remain a nonstarter & not commented on.", "This. Your GF doesn\u2019t understand Eating Disorders. Many people who haven\u2019t actually had one or lived with someone who has one don\u2019t understand, even if a doctor tells them why certain things happen. I was Bulimic for 20 years, I\u2019m now in recovery and it\u2019s still hard because issues occur where you wouldn\u2019t expect since EDs tend to colour a lot of different parts of life. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think this is an asshole situation, I think this is a situation where she needs more information and understanding. Have a chat with your son, see what he is comfortable with her knowing given that she clearly wants to try and be there for him and do things like have meals together and try to explain things to your Gf so she knows more. She did a kind thing and she was trying to be a good human but sadly his ED means he isn\u2019t capable of giving her the thanks I expect he wanted to give. I expect that on some level he wanted very much to thank her and eat the meal and enjoy food with the two of you but he just isn\u2019t well enough for that yet and it sucks. I used to wish I could eat the meal/ cake/ brownies that a friend had prepared but knew I couldn\u2019t keep it down so I\u2019d have to refuse in order to not give in to my Ed. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if it will help but a few times people have got upset with me not eating their food.

I want to eat the food, I appreciate your effort but I can\u2019t trust myself right now and I don\u2019t want to insult your cooking, waste your money and time or use your food to hurt myself. I\u2019m not eating right now so that i can get better and then in the future I can say yes to cake and we can eat a slice together without my illness getting in the way.\u201d\n\n\nIt took a long time but now? I can eat cake or have a meal with friends and it\u2019s all mostly good. Your son can get there, it\u2019s a hard road but he can make it and that meal will taste all the better because he earned the peace of mind to enjoy it. Good luck to him and to you", "He handled it by telling her he was anorexic. She obviously interpreted that as 'picky'. This is on HER to learn and handle this, not him. He doesn't owe anyone an apology for not being able to eat at certain times. Do people with cancer have to sit with their therapist and discuss how to handle other people's butt hurt when they can't eat much, or anything?", "Hey calm you horses. I have not said any of the things you are reacting to. He will (as he has) get fallout from having anorexia. So yes he and his father need to discuss how to handle that, the impact that has on them, the relations they have and their mental health, either with each other or with a specialist/therapist. \n\nThe gf is and remains TA, obviously."]}
