The three of us are part of a bigger friendgroup of about 7. I've been looking for a new place but i havent been very vocal about it. The new room is a huge upgrade, I get my own kitchen and it is in the city centre, plus it is very cheap.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was very happy when asked and i immediately said yes and i started making arrangements. When I was asked, Audrey told me that she and Emma had first asked another friend of ours, \"Madeleine\". Madeleine is part of the same group i mentioned earlier, but she was a bit more outspoken than me that she was looking for a new house. So naturally, Emma and Audrey had first asked her. \n\nMadeleine declined the offer, saying she had no money to pay the rent. The rent of this place is relatively low, but still higher than Madeleine was used to, and she is only living on student loans- she doesn\u2019t have a side job so she simply wouldn\u2019t be able to pay. Emma en Audrey had given her time to think about it and tried to make it happen for Madeleine, but to no avail.\n\nMadeleine was really sad about this, because she really wanted to move, but was very clear in her decline. Audrey explained this to me so i would know this whole thing was a bit sensitive for Madeleine, I understood completely. I asked Audrey if she was sure Madeleine didn't want it, and Audrey said no.\n\nSo I started to fix everything that needed to be done before moving there. I asked one of my close friends to take my old room, and he said that he wanted to, so i got very exited with the idea of a friend living in my old house.\n\nThat evening, Madeleine called me. She said that she regretted saying 'no', and that she wished she had thought better about this. After she declined, she said, she changed her mind, and had started thinking she could make some extra money so she could pay the rent and still move there. She did not communicate this with any of us. Madeleine said she was very sad and angry with herself that she had said 'no'. I felt she was jealous at me, because i (as her friend) d\u00f3 get to live there, with two of our best friends. She said she couldn't really be happy for me.\n\nIt crossed my mind to pull myself back from the offer so Madeleine could still get to move there, but I didn't because I really wanted the new home. Plus, I had already arranged a renter for my old house. She said no, clearly, and i said yes, and i had already started planning everything.

Madeline sounds annoying. She seriously called to try and guilt trip you?!? Also, as said above, she won\u2019t be able to pay the rent. She\u2019d maybe pay one or two months and then cry and whine to her friends til they chipped in and paid it for her. You\u2019re absolutely right, she\u2019s just jealous.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Sounds like she had plenty of time to change her mind and only changed it once she saw someone else benefitting. Try not to worry about it. She doesn\u2019t need to be happy for you. This is a her problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She didn't want it badly enough to do that until you planned to move into it."]}
