My mom loves Christmas, she goes nuts every year, like you can pin my house from the spacial station because all the lights she puts on. She knows I hate to put the tree together and take it down. So, now that I live by myself she leaves me alone. I'm enjoying the last Christmas without a tree (I have a Goddaughter and she is young now, the next year she will have questions about where is Santa going to put the presents without a tree, so yeah).

I don't put up decorations or do anything exceptional in the run up.

You don't like the pushback?\n\nWell the pushback only follows the pushing. So you won't have pushback if you stop pushing.", "I think it's worse than that. Stepmom probably ruined xmas for OP. My parents were very particular about how holiday decorating was done. They also made the kids do it and we had to fix it if it was wrong. When I moved out I did not decorate for years and years. I have a kid now and he can decorate how ever he wants. When he was a toddler 90% of the ornaments were on the bottom 1/3 of the tree. I sent pictures to my parents.

Most adults without kids have better things to do than spend time and money decorating for Christmas. I mean realistically many adults don't have a huge number of visitors - don't have a holiday party and get more than enough of Christmas at work and in stores. You can't escape Christmas decorations.\n\nIf someone wants to decorate for their own pleasure - god bless them but I don't know any childless people who have a tree - the most might be a wreath on their front door if they have a lot of spirit.\n\nBut of course the issue is that stepmother has no right to have any say over OP's home and what she does or doesn't do in it. If OP wanted to decorate with satanic cult stuff, that would be her prerogative. Of course OP could also tell her no tree this year but I am doing a multicultural thing with a menorah and a kinara", "NTA. You're an adult in your own place.

I take time off work to put them up.  Takes 3 ten hours days.  Crazy!!  My husband does not like all the mess, when it\u2019s coming down and putting it up, but he kindly tolerates it because he knows that this is my one time per year to be kind of creative. I make the garland, not kitschy, but hopefully beautiful, huge main tree, etc etc.  We have a small family, and the kids are grown, so they come in for holidays, but it\u2019s limited time.  So I admit that it\u2019s for me. He likes it once it\u2019s done, but hates the disruption.  All that to say, as much of a nut as I am about decorating, I would never try to get the kids, (2 steps and mine from my 1st marriage) to decorate.  The oldest has kids and a house, so they decorate.  The younger ones are in apartments, so they don\u2019t. I really do not care either way, because it\u2019s THEIR HOME, not mine.  \nYou are NTA by any means, but Christmas decorating is different for different people.

She can butt out.", "My mom had two trees. One for her and one for my sister and I. She got her perfectly decorated house magazine tree and I got to make a tinsel-ish and knickknack monstrosity because my sister was indifferent and I am a Christmas monster who sings Christmas songs year-round. My sister and I got table trees when we moved out and I was the nerd who decorated mine with mini ornaments. Stepmom needs a chill pill.\n\nMy dad and stepmom were more like the family in a Christmas story when it came to the tree. My dad was a little weird and would burn frankincense and myrrh despite the fact it gave me migraines and then we would watch it\u2019s a wonderful life and the pope addressing the Catholics.

It's not that I dislike Christmas or all the hoopla that comes with it, I'm just lazy and would rather look at other peoples' decorations.", "I spent Christmas 2015 in Hawaii with my wife's family\u2014her parents met and married at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1965, so it was a 50th anniversary trip.

She did a fine job and was a gracious host. But when my wife and I bought a house 800 miles away, she decided that she was going to spend Thanksgiving with us. My sister came along. For many years we had a grand time, just the four of us, making a streamlined version of the traditional dinner and then having some local friends over for leftovers on Friday. I got into the habit of making a stew with leftover turkey, sweet potatoes, spinach, and peanuts on Friday\u2014highly recommended as a way to use leftovers without feeling like you're eating the same thing the day after.", "That sounds great!

My son lives with me, he is an adult, but develpmentally delayed, so Christmas for him is a big deal and always will be, my brother has nobody in his life, so I do it for him as well. I think its just my meloncholy mood that has me feeling unenthused. I used to go all out with baking and the whole shabang.
