I was upset with myself for not being able to do it. My youngest son made a simple Nativity scene at his Sunday school class. It was our only decoration that year.

I have had a tree or decorated since. \ud83d\ude0a", "*I may be an asshole because I did get short with her* \n\nShe nagged you.  \n\nThe first time she asked, you answered.  Normal people would have accepted your answer and left it at that.  \n\nShe obviously didn't accept your answer, but felt that if she kept on asking, you would get the hint that you should live your life her way, not yours, and change your answer to please her.  That's nagging.  If it's a pattern of behavior for her, and she does this with other things, too, it's very possibly emotional abuse, meant to force you to comply with her desires for your life.  When someone won't accept your likes and dislikes, but tries to insinuate that you should like what they want you to like, emotional abuse is definitely a possibility.\n\nSo, someone who refuses to accept your answer, who kept on nagging you, and wouldn't stop. And you reacted with frustration because of her lack of respect for you.  \n\nThere are times when being \"short\" with someone isn't a bad thing.  Her behavior wasn't appropriate, and you reacted in a way to let her know that HER behavior wasn't appropriate.  \n\n*and sorta called her selfish* \n\nWell, she was.  Not just selfish, but trying to subtly demand that you comply with her wants, when this is your life and your place, not hers.  She was selfish.  Telling the truth about bad behavior isn't a bad thing. \n\n*2) she's upset and won't talk to me* \n\nWhoa.  Now she's giving you the silent treatment.  That's totally manipulative behavior on her part.  It's a step to DARVOing:  deny, attack/argue/reverse victim and offender.  She's heading towards this, and could very soon be claiming she needs an apology from you.  If she does this, she's wrong, and it's emotional abuse, flat out.  \n\nShe's upset because you have your own likes and dislikes, and they aren't exactly like hers.  That's wrong behavior.  \n\nShe's trying to punish you, for having your own opinions.  That's wrong behavior.  \n\nYou have a right to be yourself, not her mini me, not her fantasy of who she wants you to be.  You are a person, not her toy.  You deserve respect for being you.  You deserve to not be pressured to be who she wants you to be.  \n\n*and I do feel bad because Christmas is clearly important to her.*\n\nBut it's not important to you.   Where's the respect FOR you here?  I like blueberries, one of kids doesn't.   I respect that and do not insist that they enjoy blueberries with me.  They like things I'm not fond of.  We enjoy that the other enjoys different things.  \n\nThis is not your fault.  You are NTA.  You deserve respect for how you want to live your life.  She's trying to manipulate you, to keep her control over you.  I don't think you did wrong to object to being treated like she treated you.
