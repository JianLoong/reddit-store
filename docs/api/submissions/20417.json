Both my best friend and I (both 29) are pregnant. We are only a couple weeks apart, me being further along. Her pregnancy has been problematic (hormonally), mine has been smooth sailing. Neither of us are sick, in pain or have complications; her issues are strictly hormonal (her words- \"I have zero issues outside of being angry 24/7\"). \n\nSo I'm sure some people here can relate when I say that a common thing in pregnancy is like.. disliking your spouse. That's my best friend, 100%. It is a very common thing. It's \"normal\"- her doctor says. She truly just can't stand him right now. Even him breathing or being in the same room is enough to piss her off. I'm the complete opposite. I have never been more infatuated or absolutely obsessed with my husband than I am right now. It's actually kind of gross how fucking perfect he is but oof, it's rough. \n\nSo I'm sitting at my friend's house today and she's just being really mean to her spouse. Demanding things from him, calling names, etc. Well, my hubby shows up in his brand new truck to pick me up and I did an eyebrow wiggle and laughed and my friends spouse goes \"wish my wife looked at me like that\". It kind of snapped me back to reality and my friend huffs and walks off. I go home. I get a text later saying \"you got Craig and I fighting because you selfishly couldn't hide your over the top happiness for 5 seconds to not make me look like an AH. You know I'm having a hard time and you made it worse. Thanks.\" I guess Craig ended up leaving for the night or something, with the words \"until you can start treating me like Beth treats John, I won't be back\". I told my friend it's not my fault she hates her spouse right now and it's selfish to ask me to hide how much I love mine. But as I said, everyone is taking her side because I'm fully aware of her struggles right now and should have made it less obvious.", "created_utc": 1687552589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h91l2/aita_for_not_hiding_my_happiness_from_my_best/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is totally unhinged. She lost her damn mind because you waggled your eyebrows at your husband who you actually like. She can get a grip hormones be damned", "NTA.\n\nShe might be struggling, but that doesn't mean she gets to dictate how you behave in your marriage. That's nuts. What she NEEDS is a therapist who specializes in pregnancy and postpartum mental health.     The husband is the key here. He is unhappy and unable to help her cope, so she needs outside help.\n\n\nETA: I would question who \"everyone\" is, though. You should not be discussing this issue with others who also know her.", "NTA. She's going to end up losing her husband and her friend if she doesn't stop treating people like this. Pregnancy isn't a hall pass to be mean to everyone.", ">you got Craig and I fighting because you selfishly couldn't hide your over the top happiness for 5 seconds to not make me look like an AH. \n\nShe did that all by herself. NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I guess Craig ended up leaving for the night or something, with the words \"until you can start treating me like Beth treats John, I won't be back\".\n\nI don't blame him for leaving. I wouldn't go back to the abuse either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm curious though; is she otherwise a good person and it truly is her hormones making her act like this? She seems like she's not even trying to control it and thinks she's doing nothing wrong.", "NTA. So you're just supposed to treat your husband the same, horrible way she treats hers in solidarity or something? Screw that, you're allowed to show affection for your own husband, and their problems are just that, *their problems*. Seems like she's clearly just taking her frustration out on you, which isn't okay. \n\nGood for her husband for walking out, though. I wouldn't be taking that kind of behavior from her, regardless of whether it's \"normal\" or not. It's one thing to be cold or distant, another to be completely disrespectful and call names.", "NTA, also i find it kind of disturbing how people call your friends husband the AH, can we stop normalizing behavior that seems like emotional abuse?\nI get that she is being fully affected by her hormones and that this is really a struggle for her. But i can not blame her husband for not wanting to be treated like absolute shit 24/7 by the person you love and that is supposed to love you.... with who you are expecting to raise a child.", "NTA apparently now that she can\u2019t treat her husband like shit it\u2019s your turn. He shouldn\u2019t have said what he said when he left but that\u2019s not your fault. This is a them issue not a you issue", "NTA.\n\nThis is also her hormones speaking. Let her have a fit on her own. She will get over it.\n\nIt's not your fault and you weren't wrong to be excited about seeing your husband. \n\nIt also isn't fair to her husband that him asking to be treated better resulted in a huge fight. \n\nAs a woman, I understand how hormones can really affect someone, but she needs to do better. \n\nIf I were you, I'd go radio silent while she has her temper tantrum.", "NTA\n\nThis lady sounds like a lot. I wouldn't take it personally since it sounds like she's just a nightmare at the moment and you just got a small tablespoon of what the husband is getting every day. Keep living your life.", "NTA\n\nHormones are not a pass to treat people like shit. You shouldn't have to hide your love from your husband simply because she's having a hard time loving hers.  Hopefully when the baby gets here she goes back to normal because Craig doesn't deserve that and frankly you deserve better friends", "NTA - I am sorry your friend is having hormonal struggles. But bluntly, not your problem-you didn\u2019t cause them. Perhaps you need a break from her until her hormones are not so bad, hopefully that will change soon. Enjoy this time with your husband!", "NTA. I\u2019d get it if you\u2019d jumped on him and smothered him with kisses in front of her but you\u2026 wiggled your eyebrows at his truck?", "I don't see how this is your problem.  NTA.\n\nHere's the thing, I don't know how common \"disliking your spouse\" is as a normal side effect of being pregnant, but I don't care if her hormones are out of whack or whatever, she doesn't get a free pass on treating her husband badly.  \n\nAnd if it's bad enough that he has basically said that he's not coming back until she stops acting like an asshole, well, that's something she caused and they need to deal with.   Nothing to do with you.", "NTA,\nShe is being too selfish expecting you to contain your love for your spouse since she doesn\u2019t have the same feelings for her partner atm.", "NTA - Your behavior just illustrated what was wrong in your friend's relationship at the moment.  Sorry she is feeling that way, but you are not responsible for her feelings and certainly do not have to mitigate yours.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou weren't being overly PDA or anything.  Your friend is overly sensitive right now and she and her husband are having some difficulties.  That's not your fault.\n\nYour friend would likely benefit greatly from an honest conversation with her OB.", "NTA\u2026your friend is tho. She should be taking to her husband about what she\u2019s feeling and together rationalize the current situation they\u2019re in", "NTA\n\nYour ability to handle your homones and her ability to handle hers is no ones fault.", "Nta-you are allowed to be happy and although your freind may not normally be like that, it is not your job to tiptoe around her. People love tearing others down and its so disgusting. be happy and dont worry about it, if you are happy, you are happy, sounds like your freind is trying to avoid any responability for her shitty behavior. Again not saying your freinds struggles are nothing but its definatly not your fault either and not your job to be miserable with her. Your friend might actually benifit speaking with a theopist as it sounds like she is dealing with quite a bit of issues. But you are not the asshole for being happy anyone who says otherwise probably isnt really your friend. Even at my lowest i have always wanted my friends to be happy.", "NTA. It\u2019s frightening what hormones can do and I find it difficult to say whether to give her a pass because of it (you are basically feeling like a different person and everything\u2019s that been going well suddenly isn\u2019t, you feel frustrated because it\u2019s not how you\u2019d. Orally feel etc., on the other - you still need to deal with the consequences) but that is not the point of discussion here. You are NTA", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me that anyone would expect you to not be yourself and be happy because someone else is struggling. Why on earth would anyone want you to do this!?", "Poor guy.  Happiest time of his life and she's just ruining it for him. Can you imagine what she's going to be like in the delivery room? \n\nI wouldn't go back either. That's more than hormones. NTA", "You are NTA, but your friend and her husband are.", "NTA.  You're not making her look like an AH, she is doing that all by herself.\n\nCraig is kind of an AH for telling her to treat him like you treat your husband, though.  \n\nSounds like they're both full of drama-hope they're better friend irl than they seem in this post.", "NTA    this reminds me of a friend who, just after a breakup, got mad at me for kissing my husband. Apparently I was rubbing my good relationship in her face.\n\nIf your friend keeps treating her husband this way, she is going to end up being a single mother. Hormones don't give you the right to abuse your husband.", "Craig is an asshole. Presumably he has had a conversation with his wife, where she has explained her hormonal issues, and that she's going to be foul and bad-tempered for a while, and it's not personal.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If everyone tried to hide their happiness to avoid upsetting already unhappy people, the world would be a pretty shit place to live in.", "NTA. You provided her husband a glimpse of what a non-abusive pregnancy can look like. Its not your fault that she treats him like shit, he was going to realize it sooner or later.", "NTA neither is Craig for that matter. What\u2019s he supposed to do for her entire pregnancy, be her punching bag because of her inability to deal with her emotions? Fuck that. And anybody who thinks she has a right to abuse her husband for that matter.", "Can you tell her you weren't happy to see you husband, you were happy to get away from the misery at her house?\n\nIs hating your husband really a common pregnancy side effect? Because I've never heard of it and it seems nuts that everyone is going along with her on it.", "NTA. I'm just wondering if before pregnancy she was a nice person....", "NTA. She was being mean before your spouse showed up so your behavior had nothing to do with hers.  I\u2019d pull back a bit and let her get herself in check and you focus on your life, new baby and awesome hubby.", "NTA. Your friend\u2026has behavioral issues, that might be unrelated to pregnancy", "To be fair, I wasn't the one who told anyone (outside of my husband of course, cause I tell him everything). I guess she called our two mutual friends and her cousin, whom I'm related to through marriage, and reiterated what happened to them. I'm close to all of them so I got the phone calls. When her cousin called me she had me on speaker and there were others there as well and they basically just all agreed that my friend was right. That it \"would have taken no effort at all\" to \"not throw my happiness in their faces\" the way I did.", "Exactly. Momentary bouts of anger and struggling are normal but if she can\u2019t come back to reality in the midst of it, then she\u2019s got more problems then just hormonal pregnancy ones.", "There may or may not have a been a lip bite.

Either way, it's not your fault.", "> Craig is kind of an AH for telling her to treat him like you treat your husband, though.\n> \n> \n\nThat's their issue though, not really OP's concern. I mean he's just seeing that being pregnant doesn't give her *carte blanche* to treat him like shit because clearly others manage. But hey, I'm sure it's tough for her going through with what she's going through... Again, that's their concern though, doesn't pertain to OP.", "Her and Craig are usually kick ass people. On a normal day (when she wasn't pregnant) she literally worshipped the ground he walked on and he did the same with her. So I'm assuming that this is just tough on both of them because of how drastic the mood shift was.", "It may not be personal and due to the hormones. But what she's doing is still abusive, so while Craig's comment was unwarranted he is the victim in their relationship.", "So her hormones are a pass to speak to him however she wants to and its his fault for not keeping his mouth shut? Wow.", "NTA. You did not throw it in their face. You just greeted your husband in front of them. I've had similar situations just being kind or loving to my partner has caused a friend to make a comment like remember when we were like that to his girlfriend. They are making your happiness their issue. You did nothing wrong.", "Yeah, your friends are wrong and she's even more the AH for calling them to talk trash about you.", "Is she even *trying* to control her own behavior and not constantly verbally abuse her husband? Does she recognize how awful she's being? Does she understand that her husband may (and should!) have reached his breaking point, and simply cannot endure any more of her abuse? \n\nLiterally all you and your husband did was give him a fleeting, momentary reminder that marriage is supposed to be loving, not abusive, and you did it entirely inadvertently, simply by being yourselves. Your friend needs to get a grip and get herself some help, or she's going to find herself a single mother from day 1, and she's going to have only herself to blame.", "Yikes, it sounds like she needs some specialized medical and/or counseling help with all this.  I'm glad they're normally good friends, but honestly it doesn't sound like either of them are coping well.  :(  It puts you in a tough spot-I\"m sorry."]}
