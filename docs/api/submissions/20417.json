She knows that she's being mean to him and she's using the fact that it's her hormones as an excuse to continue to be mean to him. That's really unfair to her husband.

Because, hormonal or not, as your friend knows how to behave and CAN control herself, but does not, you  are expected to be less nice to your husband?

She can\u2019t control her hormones but she can control what she says or take measures to get help if she really can\u2019t control it. You really think a relationship where one person is able to verbally abuse the other will last??", "Great amount of victim blaming and misogyny you got here. You must be a wonderful doctor.", "But it's ridiculous, you were happy to see him and not everyone can hide their feelings, especially when hormonally crazy in love. She didn't hide her feelings for her husband making him miserable and you uncomfortable, why isn't she the one people tell to hide ger feelings better?\n\nBTW OP i had the same as you, both pregnancies. It Kinda stayed after, pretty sure him being a great sad helped... Enjoy this, there is so little alone time later but this feeling that the other is the bees knees saves things from drowning in baby-led routines. Enjoy your pregnancy, your perfect man, and as sorry as I am for your friend, don't let her rain on your bliss!\n\nShe needs a therapist as I'm not sure how likely the negativity goes away after birth, and ppd is something one should treat immediately, for everyone's safety and her mental health. If untreated for too long it can take years to recover, even if she treats the baby OK.", "> There may or may not have a been a lip bite\n\nINFO\n\nUpper or lower lip?\n\nAlso, were your eyebrows waggling in unison or were they doing the rollercoaster thing where one goes up while the other goes down?", "> There may or may not have a been a lip bite.\n\nHmmm. I'm not gonna ask you what you had for dinner that night then.", "And you better be sure that there's no 2nd child even if Craig manages to get past this.", "My husband always brought me food from town when I told him I was having a bad day. He didn't want to poke the bear before eating\ud83d\ude02", "I had to Google what 'Aspostate Toy' was before I realized you likely meant 'Apparently it's', lol. I'm so dumb.", "You ask that question like that only support for your answer isn't solely your own previous comment", "I am 45 years old and my mother STILL bitches about how I climbed her ribs and did so absolutely constantly.", "That\u2019s why they get u several oral and digital. Lol  Then during actual intercourse. Then u wake them up when your ready again. Or if they can\u2019t handle that u buy great toys to aid in the venture. My husband was geared up ready to handle his duty so idk further than that but I\u2019m sure there are answers. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The thing about shuffling meds is that you can't do that overnight. You need to step out of the old one, cold turkey is such a bad idea, and then step into the next one, find out if it's even working for you, if the side effects are acceptable and then adjust the dosage. This takes months, sometimes years. So yeah X months of being med free might be the least worst scenario here.\n\nI swear you all think meds are some magic wand the doc waves and everything is okay. You all have no idea how medicine even works.", "YNTA.\nYou should never be expected to hide your love for your spouse just to appease others.\nAnd being pregnant and hormonal is NOT a valid reason to be an abusive witch.", "Nta. She made herself look like the asshole by being one. She knows she's having this issue but doesn't appear to be trying to correct herself. She's using it as an excuse to berate and disrespect her husband and her marriage rather than recognizing she needs to be more mindful of how she's treating him.", "INFO What do you mean by 'eyebrow wriggle'? You raised and lowered your eyebrows a few times? Why does that mean you love your husband? I don't understand. It's just sounds like you pulled a funny face so why would your friend's husband want that? NTA", "Being an asshole to one\u2019s spouse is not a \u2018struggle\u2019 and she\u2019s not the victim.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Being angry from the hormones doesn't give her an excuse to treat her partner like absolute shit. There are better ways to manage anger besides taking it out on her husband. Her husband had every right to leave, and that's not your fault for showing a few seconds of happiness with your spouse.\n\nGiven her anger and the likelihood of post partum depression, maybe a therapist might be a good idea for her to work through some of that rage.", "NTA it's absolutely the hormones talking. Not that that makes it okay", "NTA.\n\nShe has a problem. Fine. That doesnt mean the world around her has to fall in line.", "NTA, sounds like is purely a Beth problem and Craig is sick of it.\n\nHormones aren't an excuse to treat your husband/spouse/partner horribly.", "I mean, I'm pregnant and almost constantly annoyed at my man, to the point I googled and asked my OB if it was normal. It is, can't wait for it to pass and for second trimester sex drive to set in lol. But my moods are an unfortunate side effect of my body changing, not his fault. Not anyone else's. When I feel I can't control it well I tell him I need to be alone and take my ass up to our room and play my videogames. Maybe your friend should try learning awareness and remove herself from company while like that. I feel for her, I do. It's miserable but be an adult. NTA", "Your friend sounds like my ex, my child's mother, who would say the most horrible demoralizing things to me and just tear me down the core and just excuse it with \"the doctor said it was normal\". No, it was abuse. Hormones or not, it was abuse. I feel for her husband.", "How is Craig an AH when he has been quietly putting up with her nonstop abuse? He finally sees somebody being tested normally and it put into perspective just how badly he has been treated", "This is exactly what I thought too.\n\nIf this is verbatim how it happened I don\u2019t believe nobody would have taken OP\u2019s side.", "Friend is an idiot. What will she do when she goes out and sees a couple kissing or something? The World doesn't revolve around her. NTA", "It would also take no effort at from her to apoligize to her husband when she snapped at him, but hey.....", "Problem is they've only heard her side of the story.\n\nNTA", "They sounds like bullies. Maybe they should spend more time with her and when she inevitably bites their head off over something similarly stupid, they\u2019ll see that you weren\u2019t in the wrong.\n\nNTA", "Some people are more self-aware than others! \n\nI had the pregnancy stupids and sometimes the angries. \n\nBut I\u2019m also ASD. I am aware enough to know something is wrong and know how to calm myself. Always done that. It didn\u2019t stop the stupids though. \n\nSome just can\u2019t. Because they can\u2019t see the pattern. And for others - they are just angry/hateful all the time. It\u2019s really rough.", "What exactly is misogynistic in his response? He is saying that when people are in poor relationships they often exhibit bad behavior under stress. She has lost the ability to control her behavior and she absolutely needs to work on herself or the problem in order to fix it - just sitting around being angry 24/7 is not a healthy solution for anybody.", "Videogames help me if that's something you're into!"]}
