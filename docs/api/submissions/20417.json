Even him breathing or being in the same room is enough to piss her off. I'm the complete opposite. I have never been more infatuated or absolutely obsessed with my husband than I am right now. It's actually kind of gross how fucking perfect he is but oof, it's rough. \n\nSo I'm sitting at my friend's house today and she's just being really mean to her spouse. Demanding things from him, calling names, etc. Well, my hubby shows up in his brand new truck to pick me up and I did an eyebrow wiggle and laughed and my friends spouse goes \"wish my wife looked at me like that\". It kind of snapped me back to reality and my friend huffs and walks off. I go home.

Maybe she isn\u2019t thrilled with this phase of her life, but she still doesn\u2019t get to stick her nose in your marriage.", "NTA, pregnancy isn\u2019t a reason to treat ppl like shit", "NTA.  If you were throwing it in her face, sure, but you were just happy to see your husband.  You didnt tell her husband to say what he did or do what he did after you left.  Empathy doesnt require you to go emotionally numb.", "One thing is clear, this sub is abundantly childfree and has no sympathy for the difficulties of pregnancy or marriage. \n\nYou might be TA, we don\u2019t know how often or over the top you are around your friend. \n\nIt\u2019s flat out rude to talk about how well fed you are in the company of starving folks, and there\u2019s a very real chance you\u2019re \u201crubbing it in\u201d a bit how easy and lovey you\u2019re feeling compared to your \u201cfriend\u201d whose clearly struggling. I love my wife more than anyone in the world, but when my friends are having relationship problems, I usually leave out how great mine is. It\u2019s probably a better approach to try to support your friend.", "I feel like we\u2019re not getting the full story. The way it is written I refuse to believe that everyone other than your husband would think you are in the wrong - for just wiggling your eyebrows\n\nSaying he\u2019s so perfect it\u2019s gross, adding that the truck was \u2018new\u2019 unnecessarily and a few other things get my spidey senses tingling that were missing some key details", "NTA", "Wtf? NTA at all but your friend is. She using her pregnancy as an excuse to be petty & feel victimized.", "NTA. Your friend made HERSELF look like an AH for being mean to her husband. Pregnancy is not an excuse to be an AH.", "Exactly. Pregnancy is not an excuse to treat your spouse (or anyone else) like crap. Friend needs to grow up.", "Yeah, she just all mad at everyone right now. Pregnancy sounds like a roulette game that can land anywhere. \n\nGlad yours is smooth sailing OP! Enjoy!", "I have never heard of this before such a strong reaction toward her husband. I hope her doctor isn't just pushing away something deeper. I have heard of cravings, strange cravings, but not this.", "She either needs mental health treatment or to accept that she has chosen to embrace her behaviors.", "Agreed. I wouldn't go back either. Fuck I don't care how pregnant you are I am not gonna sit there and be berated for no reason, ESPECIALLY in front of a guest. And she takes ZERO responsibility for any of it. I hope this is abnormal behavior for her, but something gives me the feeling this guy made the biggest mistake of his life putting a baby in her. \ud83e\udd72", "Christ that poor man needs a divorce.  Life is too short.", "My jaw dropped when I read that disliking your spouse during pregnancy was common. I didn\u2019t act that way. And a bunch of my friends were pregnant at the same time and none of them acted like that. I would say that it was very UNCOMMON and her friend needs some professional help.", "It can be. But that doesn\u2019t mean you get to act on every negative thought and feeling. You\u2019re still an adult and responsible for how to treat people. She needs to talk to her OB and find a therapist asap", "Tbh, I\u2019d ask then why it\u2019s ok for your friend to be abusive to her husband? This is not appropriate and it sounds like he\u2019s done nothing for her to treat him this way. If her hormones are doing this now, I\u2019d be very very worried for what they\u2019ll be like postpartum. She needs to get help now. And I mean from a professional and not three enabling friends.", "You did not throw it in their face. Throwing it in their face would be commenting on it \"I'd never treat my husband like that\" or an over the top greeting with some sort of PDA. Some people just can't stand other people being happy but that's not your fault or your problem. NTA you also deserve better friends you deserve to be happy and have people surrounding you that can appreciate your happiness even if they aren't there themselves.", "An eyebrow wiggle is not throwing it in their faces. You're allowed to be happy. Don't let her bring you down.", "By that logic' it would have taken no effort At all\" for your friend to practice some basic human politeness. Imo you need a new group of friends maybe?\n\nEdited to add that if people use their harmones to be extra mean maybe they were mean to begin with.", "For Christ\u2019s sake. Throwing it in her face would be if she complains and you respond with: \u201cwell ____ and I have never been happier!\u201d  This was fricking body language, authentic and not for show, in the moment, and not aimed at or in response to her or her husband at all. Your friends are absurd. Are they also unhappy in their marriages? \n\nMaybe for your one friend it\u2019s hormones, but you might want to think a bit about your other friends. Like, if your baby is a good sleeper, or is developing faster, or if you are a happy mom, are they going to expect you to fake misery?  It\u2019s always a fine line if you are having an easier time than someone, but they are a friend, how much to share your own experience because you legitimately love talking about your baby, vs be a bit less effusive because you know someone else is having a more difficult time. But for friends who love you, the answer cannot possibly be \u201cyou are NEVER allowed to let your happiness show.\u201d  That\u2019s toxic AF.", "You didn't throw anything in their faces. You just lived your own life, with your own husband, the way you would have if they weren't there. \n\nIt's throwing it in their faces if you made a deliberate effort to show something that you *didn't* naturally just do, in order for them to see it. But you never did that! You just went about your life the way it happened to be. \n\nIt's not your fault that the way your life actually happened to be looked great next to hers.", "They are all ridiculous. Don't answer the phone, live your life.", "NTA. Best to distant yourself from all of them, it will take no effort at all.", "If it's so easy for you to control your hormone induced happiness then why can't she control her hormone induced shittiness?\n\nYes it's hard when you want to murder your husband. That's now I felt until wk 20 but no one but me knew about it because I'm an adult.", "Girl, who knows what she told her friends and family. Probably grossly exaggerated it and claimed you did it deliberately to annoy her. I would not give two shits about the opinion of people who aren\u2019t there, and not about her. As someone else said - her hormones are an explanation, but not an excuse. Her emotions are her responsibility to manage.", "I'm in the third trimester right now and I have had days where I am angry and raging at everything. The difference is I am aware it's irrational and I specifically make sure I don't take it out on my husband. When I feel the hormonal rage coming on (and it is real), I warn my husband and I go hide in a corner or take a nap until it dies down. I don't actively hate on my husband.", "She'll likely just chalk up continued abuse to postpartum", "I thought so too but I looked it up.  Apostate toy it\u2019s not that uncommon to feel anger at your spouse during pregnancy.", "I love it. She would have hated my husband and I bc I was a like a hormonal horny teenager when pregnant. A complete perv to my husband and he loved every minute of it. Lol", "Pregnancy or not, problems within her marriage should not dictate whether or not you are allowed to flirt in yours.", "that's what i wonder. you can only use pregnancy as an excuse for so long... once you are verbally abusive, that's taking it way too far.", "\u201cOh gawd here it comes!\u201d *sequesters self in time out \n\nlol. Sounds miserable but I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a way to deal ;)", "Yeah I can understand that occasionally but t sounds like this friend is simply angry 24/7 and honestly I\u2019m not sure how normal that actually is.  Hormones do crazy things but to actively hate and berate your spouse all the time simply sounds like she needs to see someone.  Oh and OP is NTA", "for me when i was at the end of my pregnancy id just cry out the hormones, usually my problem would be overthinking something small so i could eventually talk it out once i could find the words to say what was wrong, either that or because my daughter liked to wedge her feet into my lungs and get them stuck in my ribs , always on the side i was lying on too and that was extremely painful. definitely dont miss that part of pregnancy, i do miss the little kicks though before they got painful :(", "My husband is a bit upset that that is not the way my pregnancy has gone \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 my poor dude.", "Honestly, even assuming it's really down to hormones, I would be concerned about her behavior becoming habitual, and continuing well after the baby is born.", "That's really how it feels! It's so frustrating because I know it's not real, and then I get angry for being angry! Therapy has really helped me recognize my weirder emotions.", "exactly."]}
