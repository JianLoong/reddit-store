There has been no family support. But the bigger problem is no family support extends beyond your mother and family- I\u2019m not getting support from you either. My parents and sister have been there for me and the kids. They stayed with me for two months postpartum to provide the support I wasn\u2019t getting here. They are helping me plan and decorate and host this party. From you and your family all I have gotten is expectations to cater to people who haven\u2019t shown the slightest interest in our kids. If you and your mother want a birthday party in city B you can have it but you have to put forth the effort. This has a been a concerning pattern for the past years where I have been the only one held to these standards and putting forth the effort. It\u2019s high time that effort is reciprocated and appreciated.

If I was you- I would pack up you and the kids and move to city C and begin legally separating. You\u2019ve seen for the past years the foundations of how things are in this relationship. You\u2019re isolated from the people who actually support and care about you, you\u2019re expected to shoulder the whole mental load of your relationships with your husband, in-laws, and kids.

That out of the way:\n\nINFO: Have you asked your MIL to be more involved? I ask because some families just don't meet up much except at milestones & holidays. I mean, I only see most of my extended family on Easter, Christmas, & a late summer family gathering we have every year. That doesn't mean I don't care or won't visit to help out if they ask. She may just not want to intrude as she's not YOUR mom & doesn't know how much help you'd be comfortable with.\n\nI mean, all of us have seen the many stories about nightmare MIL's who try to control their children's & their spouse's lives.

Stay in city C while your husband plans one for his \"supportive family\" in city B since he's so hell bent on it.", "NTA.

He wants you separated from your family so you have no one to complain to or run when things get bad.  Start saving for your getaway.", "NTA.
