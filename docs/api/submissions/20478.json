{"id": 20478, "submission_id": "14hw0m6", "title": "AITA for Cutting off Financial Support for MIL with Cancer?", "selftext": "My (39M) wife (37F) comes from a poor, immigrant background. She\u2019s pulled herself out of poverty and we both live a decent lifestyle, upper-middle class in a very expensive metro area. She\u2019s had to overcome a lot because she was brought to the country as a child, only got the right to work in the last 10 years, and had no financial support to get through school. She has a half-brother who was born here (30-ish M), but who has basically squandered his opportunities until about 4 years ago when he joined the military and got married. We\u2019re all proud of how far he\u2019s come.  \n\nTheir parents have always struggled to make ends meet and I knew going into this relationship that we\u2019d be having to take financial care of them as they got older, but the timetable for that has been unexpectedly accelerated. They are in their early 60\u2019s, but two years ago my mother-in-law got diagnosed with cancer and hasn\u2019t worked since. She was able to cover treatments with Medicaid, but we had both their parents move in with us for about 8 months so we could help take care of her. Her brother helped contribute with money for food and stuff because he was stationed across the country.  \n\nShe made it through and they were getting ready to move into their own place again, but rents have jumped significantly. My wife and her brother agreed to help by contributing a few hundred dollars per month each since MIL couldn\u2019t work anymore.  \n\nSix months ago, her bro stopped contributing because his wife decided to stop working and he was being re stationed somewhere with higher living expenses. Whatever, we didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. Well, now her parents decided to sell some land they own back in their country which is going to net them around $20k. They intend to give it to my BIL to pay off his debts (incurred from overspending on things like sneakers, designer shirts, etc). Wife said we should put the money in a separate account and we can use it to help care for them as they get older, but he fully intends to use it for himself. This is even more frustrating since the cancer has now metastasized in her brain and we are picking her up multiple times a week to help take care of her during the day (wife is hybrid and I WFH).  \n\nAt this point, we both feel like we are being taken advantage of and that our generosity is being used to subsidize his frivolous spending. Would we be AH\u2019s if we refuse to financially help support her parents unless her brother agrees to put the $20k into a separate account for their care?", "created_utc": 1687621103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hw0m6/aita_for_cutting_off_financial_support_for_mil/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let them know that you now realize they don\u2019t need your help and will not contribute anything more while they continue to give money away.  But make sure you are doing this before they complete this transaction or else they won\u2019t have a chance to rethink their choice.  You agreed to help them, not subsidize him. I wouldn\u2019t give more even if they agree not to do this unless they are transparent about their finances. Otherwise they\u2019ll just say they\u2019ll stop and quietly do it anyways.", "NTA. Good lord your BIL needs a reality check. Maybe he can visit and see how bad things have gotten for his parents.

You would never want to kick her out or make her feel unloved, but you cannot be expected to shoulder this burden alone.\n\nIt is their money. They can do as they please with it, but you need to be honest with BIL, MIL, and FIL. You cannot realistically continue to support parents financially without assistance. If BIL is going to get out of debt and MIL/FIL are receiving government benefits, then he needs to step up and assist with care by contributing to y'all caring for parents or taking them in himself.\n\nIf BIL, MIL, and FIL refuse to understand that you can't just keep handling this without help, it's time for the really hard talk, assisted living.\n\nThey can use government assistance to find an assisted living center where their needs are met without it straining you and your wife's finances and relationship.", "If this is in the U.S., a gift that size would make them ineligible for Medicaid for Long Term Care.

I do think you need to have a lengthy and honest conversation with them, explaining your position and fears as it seems there is a communication gap. The BIL should also be involved in this conversation. Asking to offload a voluntary and generous financial burden from your own accounts in the face of new money in the in-laws family is totally reasonable.", "If your MIL's treatments are covered by Medicaid the federal government may have some say in where that $20k goes.", ">Would we be AH\u2019s if we refuse to financially help support her parents unless her brother agrees to put the $20k into a separate account for their care?\n\nINFO: What do you see as a possible positive outcome if you make this decision? Are you expecting this to \"force\" BIL's hand about the money?  Have you explicitly discussed with her parents that you need this money as a means to help them?", "NTA but your in-laws and BIL sure are. They've been taking your and your wife's money for years, but when they come into some money of their own they give it to the deadbeat son who has barely contributed at all? I guess we know who is the Golden Child in that family. Funny how the golden kids are almost never the ones to help their parents in their old age. At this point I would stop giving them any money at all if they insist on giving it to your BIL. They can just move in with him, then. You helped them when they didn't have enough, now they do, so why should you keep providing?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a time to let them know that their golden child is not going to support them, and they have only the two of you. Otherwise, bring them the catalogue of care homes/hospices, etc, so maybe it'll help them to realise how much you do for them.", "It is the parents money and they get to decide how to use it.

Lack of education and genuine financial illiteracy makes them believe they don\u2019t actually need our help and that everything will just work out. Normally, I\u2019d say let\u2019s just put the money aside and wait for reality to hit, but they have too much pride to admit when they are struggling with anything and refuse to ask for help. They would let it get so bad that by the time they admitted anything it would be far more costly for us to dig them out of the hole. We all know this about them, including her brother.  \n\nPoint is that talking with them would be like trying to negotiate with a toddler. I don\u2019t hold it against them, they just didn\u2019t grow up with the same resources we did and did the best they could. That\u2019s why this whole thing needs to be focused on her brother because he knows and is just taking advantage.", "This is great information to know. Thank you so much!", "That there are funds readily available in case of emergency.

I\u2019m not really sure what you can do tbh", "You're NTA here generally of course. \n\n--->But if the in-laws are firm on giving the $20K to BIL and he is firm on keeping it for himself, you two just announcing \"We're out\" won't accomplish anything. (Unless your wife is basically OK with standing back while her ill mother declines, doubtful.)\n\nThe discussion obviously needs to be with your in-laws, to convince them to have the property proceeds set aside for their needs. Keep applying pressure in that direction instead and make Plan B instead of relying on an ultimatum to solve this problem.  Good luck.", "She actually did help for a while. They get along great and we know she would be willing to do that. Trouble is that they live on base in another state.", "You need to talk with an elder care specialist.

Make any help you give them depend on them keeping that money.", "NTA", "Idk if you looked at the comments, but the government won\u2019t see it as the parents money. \nEspecially if they are going to into a nursing home, you get judged on your assets and look into your financial history from the last ten years. Giving away 20k while receiving government benefits isn\u2019t something that will go unnoticed.", "Yes. My mother is currently in this situation and we are disputing the lien Medicaid has against it. But due to your situation, if they put a lien against the funds y\u2019all won\u2019t be able to dispute.", "If that's the case, then OP, you need to contact a social worker ASAP.\n\nBecause if they give that money to BIL and then their care benefits get cut, they are going to sink you and your wife.", "NTA. If the cancer has metastisized to her brain, though, she probably can't make that kind of rational decision. I'm not sure how FIL is with that, but you can call adult protective services if you think they're being taken advantage of and can't protect themselves or understand what's happening effectively.", "NTA the money belongs to the parents.

However, do not let that money get into the brother's hands regardless of what he promises. From your comments, it is better to work on your brother refusing to take the money.\n\nTell your brother that if he accepts the money, he can expect his parents the next day on his doorstep to live with him because you will be done supporting them.
