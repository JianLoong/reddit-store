She\u2019s pulled herself out of poverty and we both live a decent lifestyle, upper-middle class in a very expensive metro area. She\u2019s had to overcome a lot because she was brought to the country as a child, only got the right to work in the last 10 years, and had no financial support to get through school. She has a half-brother who was born here (30-ish M), but who has basically squandered his opportunities until about 4 years ago when he joined the military and got married. We\u2019re all proud of how far he\u2019s come.  \n\nTheir parents have always struggled to make ends meet and I knew going into this relationship that we\u2019d be having to take financial care of them as they got older, but the timetable for that has been unexpectedly accelerated. They are in their early 60\u2019s, but two years ago my mother-in-law got diagnosed with cancer and hasn\u2019t worked since. She was able to cover treatments with Medicaid, but we had both their parents move in with us for about 8 months so we could help take care of her. Her brother helped contribute with money for food and stuff because he was stationed across the country.  \n\nShe made it through and they were getting ready to move into their own place again, but rents have jumped significantly. My wife and her brother agreed to help by contributing a few hundred dollars per month each since MIL couldn\u2019t work anymore.  \n\nSix months ago, her bro stopped contributing because his wife decided to stop working and he was being re stationed somewhere with higher living expenses. Whatever, we didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. Well, now her parents decided to sell some land they own back in their country which is going to net them around $20k. They intend to give it to my BIL to pay off his debts (incurred from overspending on things like sneakers, designer shirts, etc). Wife said we should put the money in a separate account and we can use it to help care for them as they get older, but he fully intends to use it for himself. This is even more frustrating since the cancer has now metastasized in her brain and we are picking her up multiple times a week to help take care of her during the day (wife is hybrid and I WFH).  \n\nAt this point, we both feel like we are being taken advantage of and that our generosity is being used to subsidize his frivolous spending. Would we be AH\u2019s if we refuse to financially help support her parents unless her brother agrees to put the $20k into a separate account for their care?", "created_utc": 1687621103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hw0m6/aita_for_cutting_off_financial_support_for_mil/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The BIL should also be involved in this conversation.

They've been taking your and your wife's money for years, but when they come into some money of their own they give it to the deadbeat son who has barely contributed at all?
