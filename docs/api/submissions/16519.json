My husband and I (M/F in our 30s) have a child  who will be 9 months old when the wedding happens, and it\u2019s in a town several hours drive from where we live. We decided to get a hotel there for the weekend. We arranged to have a family friend in this town watch our baby during the 6-hour wedding time frame, not the whole weekend. \n\nI just learned that Baby is also not allowed to attend the rehearsal dinner the day before the wedding, which my husband and I were invited to. We don\u2019t know anyone else in this town that we would trust to watch Baby, except people who are invited to the wedding and are therefore unavailable. \n\nThis cousin has never met Baby, and my husband and I are fairly close to him. He\u2019s like a brother honestly, but he doesn\u2019t have kids of his own, so he doesn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d the family part of children. I feel he sees them as an annoyance by default. He hasn\u2019t met Baby because he lives across the country, much further than the town they are marrying in. So I thought this would be a good opportunity to at least have Baby meet him and some other family members, share experiences at an event, take pictures, etc. But Baby is not allowed. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to ask this family friend to watch my child 2 nights in a row (for free, for the record). So now I don\u2019t want to go to the rehearsal dinner because I think the cousin is being a bit pretentious with the protocol. But I know he would be very offended if I declined the rehearsal dinner invite, saying I should leave Baby with someone from my hometown for the weekend (hours from the wedding venue), or find a sitter locally. \n\nI feel a little passive aggressive to basically tell him that I can\u2019t make it because I have no one to watch my Baby. Would I be the AH for not attending my cousin\u2019s rehearsal dinner because he doesn\u2019t want babies there?\n\nEdit: For context, my husband is in the wedding party.

If you threaten to decline in order to put pressure on cousin to allow the baby, YWBTA. Weddings and wedding adjacent events such as shower, rehearsal dinner, etc are supposed to be for focusing purely on the bridge and groom. So the rule for those events is your deal with your own dilemmas or joys without bringing attention onto yourself, your child, etc. Pick which one of you will stay with the baby, and the other person attends and passes along regrets from the other parent. Send a thoughtful note from the person who can't attend. Leave babysitting out of the note; just express your love and support for the happy couple.\n\nAlso pay the friend who is babysitting for six hours, or at least bring them a gift of something you personally know they adore and can't get easily. That is a world-class friend, and taking them for granted would be foolish.", "NAH - but the way you are saying to use his rehearsal dinner for your family to meet the baby and get photos is an AH thing to do.

If my only exposure to children was be finding out that once someone has one, they start thinking they're entitled to scrutinise and second-guess my choices about things that aren't their business, I'd see children as an annoyance too. \n\nIf you are keen to show your cousin what an annoyance your child isn't, you're going about it in a really counter-productive way. \n\nYTA", "Not the wedding, the rehearsal dinner. And the baby is way too young to be away from parents for an entire weekend, so cousin is being (probably unintentionally) inconsiderate with demanding both events be child free.", "Thanks for your perspective! We definitely wouldnt bring it up to cousin", "Is the kid named \"Baby\"? Why the grammatical choice and the cap \"B\"? So many other questions that may lend insight to OPs thinking.", "No, I think a rehearsal dinner is a great chance for the family to meet the baby. A lot of family will be there but it isn't the actual wedding.", "Exactly! I was baffled when I read that the person was doing it was free, they should get some sort of compensation, weddings can go all day and night!!", "So why would that make her the asshole for *not* going with the kid if the kid isn't wanted there :-/", "Did you even read the question?? If you did your answer would be NTA because your suggestion at the end is literally what OP is trying to do. Decline invite due to needing to watch baby while husband goes to dinner", "It's not just ~inconvenient~, her baby is small, in a strange place, and would have to be left with someone who may be familiar to the parents but not to the baby. There's a huge increase in accidents with babies and small children in travel situations, especially staying in a hotel.", "But that\u2019s not what she\u2019s asking?", "It's definitely a big reason why I wouldn't go to my twin's wedding even if I wasn't having a baby around that time. I have two small children and she's having her wedding literally on the other side of the country, totally child free mainly to avoid the tiny number of children in our extended family.", "There\u2019s an edit; her husband is in the wedding party. He should go imho because of that. She could always skip it.", "It\u2019s hard bc I AM one of those people not willing to miss the rehearsal dinner! I was not a mom as of 5 months ago! But times have changed for me, and I have to get used to making adjustments for others", "Username checks out", "Why? Not everyone wants to be around kids", "She wanted the baby to \"experience\" the event (that it will in no way remember\" and introduce it to people and have them take pictures with it. Maybe he doesn't want kids because OP seems to think this was a meet and greet for HER and not their rehearsal dinner.", "Absolutely not being inconsiderate by wanting it to be child free. If OP can\u2019t make it work the. It\u2019s fine she doesn\u2019t attend but it\u2019s not unreasonable or pretentious to not want babies at any wedding event", "Yes, I said one (or neither) could go to the dinner so they didn't have to use a babysitter twice. They have a babysitter for the wedding and are fine with being away from the baby for the wedding or they wouldn't have gotten a babysitter and made plans to attend any portion of the festivities.\n\nIt is not the responsibility of the groom to have a wedding that caters to all (potential) guests' concerns or preferences. They are allowed to have a child free dinner, wedding, life..... Other people get to decide the same and whether they will attend child free events or not.\n\nRead it again. OP is more disappointed because she planned to introduce baby at the dinner and now she can't pull focus from the couple. Not that she wanted to pull focus intentionally, but she was envisioning attention for her and baby.", "Disagree, it's cousins event and if OP and their partner cannot attend, they cannot attend. OP can leave baby with her partner or bring the baby and get a local sitter to watch them for the 2 events. OP's baby is not Cousin's responsibility to accommodate at their child-free events.", "Communication. All this would be sorted out with communication between OP and their cousin.", "It's not the entire weekend and both parents don't have to be away from baby.  OP could ask her friend to watch the baby or recommend a sitter.  OR OP could stay at the hotel with baby and maybe invite her friend over and order room service and the two of them can catch up.", "8 hours over 2 nights isn't that big of a deal", "Nope, you didn\u2019t pay for that event, you are a guest. This is NOT a time for a meet and greet for your baby.", "Babies do not belong at rehearsal dinners and even if a couple says it's ok it's highly likely they DON'T want them there and are just not willing to deal with Drama. This is shellfish of the OP", "YWBTA. What sucks is that you didn\u2019t know that you couldn\u2019t bring your baby to the rehearsal dinner prior to arriving in the city. If it was a child-free wedding, you probably SHOULD have assumed all wedding-adjacent events would also be child-free, or should have asked in advance. \n\nMy sister had a child-free wedding when my daughter was 9mos old. I was the officiant, and as the sister had other wedding jobs. She got married in a city a 1000km journey from where I live, and I didn\u2019t know anyone who could babysit in that city who wasn\u2019t already coming to the wedding. My husband and I brought my in-laws with us, and it was really ideal for everyone. They got to have basically an entire day to sight-see with my baby, and I got to have an entire day to myself\u2014which was effing glorious. I visited with friends and relatives I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time, I danced, I drank good wine, I ate good food, I didn\u2019t have a tiny human gnawing on my boob\u2026 Husband had a lot of fun too, as he got to do a bit more with his parents and our baby, while I was getting ready for the wedding, AND he still had half a day of adult time. \n\nIt\u2019s okay, and in fact very healthy, to have time away from your child. But if you want to bring your child everywhere with you, be aware that your desire to be with your child is just as legitimate as others\u2019 desire NOT to be around your child. You just have to accept that.", "Great, do that for your rehearsal dinner then. Cousin is not obligated to turn his rehearsal dinner into the OP's Baby Show.", "Agreed so many people are either intentionally misinterpreting or are so triggered they don\u2019t even realize the question at hand. It\u2019s WIBTA for declining invite because baby isn\u2019t invited and the answer is NO. Why would her saying she can\u2019t go because baby can\u2019t make her an AH?? Everyone is acting like she\u2019s going to tell cousin that baby should be invited when that\u2019s not the case at all", "Because some redditors hate kids with a fiery passion and those people froth at the mouth any chance they can call someone an asshole for anything related to them having a kid.", "Her husband is a groomsman which means he  needs to be at the rehearsal dinner. She can stay home with baby for the night.", "Then she doesn\u2019t need to go but it\u2019s not the groom\u2019s responsibility to accommodate her baby.", "She\u2019s asking if she\u2019s the asshole to feline going to the rehearsal dinner because they didn\u2019t allow babies, which she knew they didn\u2019t allow babies for the actual wedding so why would it be different for a rehearsal?? She\u2019s the YTA for thinking it is and declining to go because she didn\u2019t think right.", "OIC. Thanks for letting me know about the edit. \n\nIn that case, I'm going with \n\n- find a babysitter in the next few months and both go\n\n- he goes, she stays with Baby in hotel room, relax, order food", "Ok well you would be the A if you expected him to change his requirements, imo. I thought you were just asking if you'd be the A if you bowed out, which you wouldn't be.\n\nBut if you're asking us \"would I be the A for threatening to bow out, in order to guilt him into letting the baby come\" then sorry but yes you would.", "I do think it might be inconsiderate if they failed to communicate that baby wasn\u2019t invited to the rehearsal in a timely matter though, especially if they knew baby would be coming and arrangements would be made locally. It\u2019s totally reasonable not to want a baby at the rehearsal dinner, but the cousin can\u2019t be offended if one parent has to miss the rehearsal dinner because they weren\u2019t given adequate time to plan", "They are talking about the dinner the night before not the wedding. And your idea that you keep hammering is LITERALLY what OP is suggesting. That she won\u2019t be able to go due to not having anyone to watch baby and her husband is a member of the wedding party and must attend. The whole question is would they be TA for saying she can\u2019t go due to needing to watch baby.", "The partner is in the wedding.  So she can stay in the hotel while be attends. Problem solved.", "Lol. Wtf? They said they agreed. Do you always keep an argument going after someone said they agree? Lol", "And she\u2019s not asking the groom to accommodate she\u2019s simply asking if she\u2019d be the asshole if she didn\u2019t go. \n\nCut and dry. She provided context because she wants to explain why she\u2019s there in the first place but she\u2019s not asking if she would be the asshole if she asked the groom to accommodate. \n\n> Would I be the AH for not attending my cousin\u2019s rehearsal dinner because he doesn\u2019t want babies there?\n\n^ that is the question posed. Why are you pretending the question is something else?", "I disagree with your logic. If the wedding is child free, by default the rehearsal dinner is. Op made assumptions she shouldn\u2019t have.", "The wedding is child free of fucking course everything else would be. Are you high?", "The wedding is months away so there is plenty of time to plan. And I agree that the groom shouldn\u2019t be upset if OP can\u2019t attend because she needs to stay with the baby. OP is talking about not going more out of spite for the fact that the baby can\u2019t go and as though the groom should make an exception, which is unreasonable.", "Yes they would be unless asked. It's not like the OP is looking to inform, they're looking to start shit. \n\nThe issue is that OP consider not having children at the rehearsal dinner something to get passive aggressive about. Which it isn't, because there is nothing wrong with that choice.\n\n\"Am I an asshole for being denied the right to make the rehearsal dinner about my baby and wanting to sulk at the couple about it?\"\n\nYes, OP is.", "That\u2019s not how it always works.", "In my experience that\u2019s not how it always is. I\u2019ve been to a few with child friendly rehearsal dinners and child free weddings to help save parents some of the cost of childcare and get pictures with kids included before the wedding. It\u2019s pretty common. And no I\u2019m not high, but maybe you should be because you seem a little too invested and emotional on behalf of an internet stranger\u2019s cousin", "\ud83d\udc4c"]}
