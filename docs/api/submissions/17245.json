He has two children from a previous relation ages 6, and 10, where the mom has no contact with them. I\u2019m the only mother figure they have. I do all the wifely and motherly duties, and love those kids as if they were my own. I got all the cute little crafts from school for Mother\u2019s Day on Friday, which I was very excited for.\n\nI know I\u2019m not their biological mom, but I play the part in every aspect. I check under the bed for monsters for the youngest, I make their school lunch and get them to and from school. I kiss them both goodnight every night and tell them I love them. Last year we had a big Mother\u2019s Day bbq and my fianc\u00e9 mother took the kids to get me gifts, and I don\u2019t care about all that. I\u2019m grateful, but this year when not a single kid said it to me I was a little disappointed. When I said to my fianc\u00e9 about me feeling a little upset he got snappy and said why, I shouldn\u2019t be bc I\u2019m not their real mom.\n\nThis has nothing to do with ex, he hates his ex, she\u2019s incarcerated and had their youngest in jail. I told him I know I\u2019m not their real mom, but they call me mommy, and I take care of them as if they were. He just shrugged and said that didn\u2019t matter, and that he told them they didn\u2019t have to say it this year. He said it saved him the trouble because the kids wanted to make \u201chandprint things\u201d for me, whatever that means, but I\u2019m sure I would of loved it. I expressed that that hurt me deeply, and that I think of them like my children and I always make sure something nice is done for Father\u2019s Day. Again he only shrugged and said I was making a big deal and being an ah and that his kids didn\u2019t have to do anything he didn\u2019t want them too, and that I was over reacting.\n\nNow I\u2019m really upset, my fianc\u00e9 has diagnosed bipolar if that helps you with the understanding of his moods. I just thought appreciation would be nice, even if I\u2019m not their real mother.

He said it saved him the trouble because the kids wanted to make \u201chandprint things\u201d for me\"*\n\nHonestly, it sounds like he discouraged the kids from recognizing OP on Mother's Day so he wouldn't have to help them make the crafts they wanted to give to her as gifts.", "He told them they didn\u2019t have to say anything this year", "This times a million!!! Op you\u2019re nta by any means, you\u2019re a valid mom, happy Mother\u2019s Day, love. I\u2019m so sincerely sorry to you for having to experience this, but this is deeper than bpd, that man truly at his core doesn\u2019t hold you in a high enough regard to help his children make you a homemade gift, to the point it\u2019s more convenient for him to just write you off. Please see that man for what he is.", "For her sake, let\u2019s hope so!", "Would it be wrong to admit that I think he might have someone else in mind to fill that role now? Seems sketchy to have the children participate in all the other activities for Mothers Day but to tell them explicitly not to call her mom??? When she\u2019s the mother figure they have? Methinks there\u2019s something wrong here.", "My mom makes my life hell when she goes off her meds. If this is a cycle i would leave. She thought she didnt need them anymore and stops taking them. Only to have sever melt downs. Shes been in the hospital 3 times this week. \n\nAlso if you act like mom and the kids like you then it seems like he pushed it cause he didn't want to. Does he show you he values you on other holidays that involve you? Dates? Surprises?", "I thought you should run before I read this now I know you should run while you still can. An unmedicated bipolar who snaps and told his kids not to appreciate you on Mother\u2019s Day because he didn\u2019t want to do anything. This is multiple red flags on the same pole.", "INFO: Why exactly are you engaged for 3 years without getting married? Because it looks like it\u2019s convenient for him and he\u2019s stringing you along with the proposal.\nYou were 24 when you got engaged, how long had you been dating before?", "For god sake, don\u2019t marry this guy. He doesn\u2019t respect anything you do for him or his kids and he refuses to treat his mental illness. It won\u2019t get better.", "Please don't feel like you need to accept being mistreated because of his disorder. Many, many people have bipolar disorder and it does not make them assholes. It might make him extra tired and low motivation if he's down right now, but how he handles that is on him. A decent human would have said he loves you, he's sorry, but he just didn't have the spoons to organize something today. Instead he's gaslighting you. Not ok.", "I was married to someone who was bipolar who refused to take his medication this is going to get worse. You do not deserve to be treated this way and it's time to cut your losses and walk away.", "Unmedicated bipolar would be a deal breaker for me.", "Do not throw the rest of your life away on this man just because you love his kids.  You deserve to be with someone who treats you with love and respect.", "That's a lie. You can't control BPD. It is a chemical imbalance. You need medication to treat a chemical imbalance. You can't force it away. Some therapists find success in intensive therapy to teach people how to control their reaction to triggers for outbursts, but this is usually in conjunction with hospitalization and medication. Unless your partner has spent years in a facility, this is not true, and based on their outburst over this, I can guarantee therapy if done has not been sufficient. \n\nIf he told you he can control, cope, or manage it, he is gaslighting you. Gaslighting is manipulation of facts to make you question your sanity or reality. Common ways it is done is telling you something, \"I promise to watch the kids this weekend\" and on Saturday getting mad at you and saying, \"I never said that.\" Every single medical practitioner will tell someone with BPD to medicate. Their is no controlling. This person is dragging you down with toxicity. He is making you believe his lies and world view despite the fact it is medically false. No amount of therapy will fix this. \n\nGet out before it is too late. This man would rather tell his kids to not even say happy mothers Day and ruin your day for his comfort. He absolutely does not care about you or his kids. He also made it clear to you that he will never treat you as their mother and do everything in his power to make sure his kids don't either. \n\nIf you never brought it up, he would never have told you. He would let you think his kids did not like or love you. That is manipulative and a lie by omission. It is gaslighting as you would question if you really were being a good mother figure. \n\nFinally, the issue is not that he has BPD. The issue is he knows it and intentionally puts himself in a position to have an outburst. The emotional inability to regulate or handle a situation such as a child forgetting mothers day and you being mad is way different than if HE CREATED the entire situation for his selfish benefit. He weaponized his mental illness to manipulate you. Gaslighting to the point you really had to post here and ask if you were an AH for not being happy he ruined the day. \n\nYou deserve a round of applause for stepping into a mom role for someone elses kids. Not an AH fiance.", ">but he has the ability to control it\n\nSounds great, how does he do that?\n\n>he just refuses to take his medication properly\n\nSo he *doesn\u2019t* have the ability to control it, otherwise he would be taking his meds.", "Yeah, him not taking his prescribed medication needs to be a deal breaker. Because if he goes off his meds and decides to leave you, you have zero right to contact with the kids. So you can\u2019t marry him and take that role in their lives knowing that he is so unstable, he could take them away from you. He needs to be 100% committed to his treatment plan before you get married.", "Until he grows up and takes responsibility for managing his own mental health, you should not marry this man.", "Don't marry him. Don't marry someone who won't take their needed medication.", "As someone with mental health issues, I\u2019m so sick of people using mental health issues as an excuse to be an asshole. We all have our moments, but if he has meds, then he should be taking them properly. That\u2019s on him and there is no excuse for it.", "You should get out as soon as possible.", "Someone who is supposed to be a responsible father and partner takes their meds everyday. He doesn\u2019t take his responsibilities seriously to himself or his loved ones if he isn\u2019t taking his meds.", "/u/ThrowRayCan as a bipolar person I think this has very little to do with his disorder and everything to do with his microscopic regard for you. He has no problem letting you raise his children but actively cripples the positive relationship y'all appear to have.\n\nAlso, don't deal with someone who has access to medication and refuses to take it. I'm literally about to get a round of iron infusions because my anemia is contributing to depressive episodes. That's on top of daily meds and vitamins because those nutrient deficiencies contribute to mental health swings. I don't even have kids but I'm doing everything I can to stop feeling like absolute garbage and he's not even doing the bare minimum available to him. If you want to stick with him then try and get him to see a mental health nurse practitioner, but you really really shouldn't have to manage this for him.", "I am bipolar and I take zero medication and I do not do and say things that hurt people like this\u2026.. EVER.", "> everyday therefore it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nPeace out.", "Slight disagree. That's why I asked what he said to them.  \n\nSaying you don't have to leaves the choice up to the kids. Just like telling a 10 year old you don't have to call your step mom mom.  It's not saying don't do it, it's saying the choice is up to you. \n\nMy guess especially for the older child, their mom is their mom, even if she's a terrible mom locked up that's their mom.  So even if OP does everything for these kids it won't change that in their mind", "So basically saying if they wanted to they could and they chose not to", "Nope. First thing I thought was he is going to replace her.", "Tell me you don\u2019t care about or respect your fianc\u00e9e without telling me you don\u2019t care or respect your fianc\u00e9. As my grandma used to say \u2018he thinks his peen is studded with diamonds, when we all know it is not\u2019.", "But she also says the children already call her mommy.", "I understand what you\u2019re getting at but here\u2019s the thing he only said it after the kids were asking for his help to make her gifts for Mother\u2019s Day so in this context \u201ccould you help us make gifts for mommy\u201d \u201cno you don\u2019t have to tell mommy happy mother day this year\u201d and in a child\u2019s mind i feel like that would tell them not to", "Not exactly. Assuming he even said it that way (which I doubt bc he didn\u2019t want to deal with helping them make gifts). Telling that to children so young encourages them not to say it.", "I wonder if that's a choice or if they were told to call her mommy.  \n\nThe 6 year is a toss up,  but at 10 if a parent says you don't have to do something, it's similar to the comment about men. If they want to they would.", "Disagree.  \n\nLet's change it from mother's day to calling her mom.\n\nIs saying \"you don't have call her mom if you don't want to\" encouraging them no to\n\nWhat if a parent tells a 3 year old \"you don't have to hug someone if you don't want to\"\n\nMy opinion that doesn't discourage a child from saying it", "The OP could comment on that, I guess.", "Except that there is no \u201ccall stepmom mom day\u201d or \u201chug your relative day.\u201d There is no special holiday that creates that expectation. Here there is a holiday that creates the expectation that the person who cares for you like a mother would be told happy Mother\u2019s Day. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, op says they told her happy Mother\u2019s Day in the past. No reason to believe this year would\u2019ve been any different, except for dad\u2019s interference."]}
