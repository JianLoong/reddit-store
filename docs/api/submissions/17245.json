He has two children from a previous relation ages 6, and 10, where the mom has no contact with them. I\u2019m the only mother figure they have. I do all the wifely and motherly duties, and love those kids as if they were my own. I got all the cute little crafts from school for Mother\u2019s Day on Friday, which I was very excited for.\n\nI know I\u2019m not their biological mom, but I play the part in every aspect. I check under the bed for monsters for the youngest, I make their school lunch and get them to and from school. I kiss them both goodnight every night and tell them I love them. Last year we had a big Mother\u2019s Day bbq and my fianc\u00e9 mother took the kids to get me gifts, and I don\u2019t care about all that. I\u2019m grateful, but this year when not a single kid said it to me I was a little disappointed. When I said to my fianc\u00e9 about me feeling a little upset he got snappy and said why, I shouldn\u2019t be bc I\u2019m not their real mom.\n\nThis has nothing to do with ex, he hates his ex, she\u2019s incarcerated and had their youngest in jail. I told him I know I\u2019m not their real mom, but they call me mommy, and I take care of them as if they were. He just shrugged and said that didn\u2019t matter, and that he told them they didn\u2019t have to say it this year. He said it saved him the trouble because the kids wanted to make \u201chandprint things\u201d for me, whatever that means, but I\u2019m sure I would of loved it. I expressed that that hurt me deeply, and that I think of them like my children and I always make sure something nice is done for Father\u2019s Day. Again he only shrugged and said I was making a big deal and being an ah and that his kids didn\u2019t have to do anything he didn\u2019t want them too, and that I was over reacting.\n\nNow I\u2019m really upset, my fianc\u00e9 has diagnosed bipolar if that helps you with the understanding of his moods. I just thought appreciation would be nice, even if I\u2019m not their real mother.

You deserve to be with someone who treats you with love and respect.", "That's a lie. You can't control BPD. It is a chemical imbalance. You need medication to treat a chemical imbalance. You can't force it away. Some therapists find success in intensive therapy to teach people how to control their reaction to triggers for outbursts, but this is usually in conjunction with hospitalization and medication. Unless your partner has spent years in a facility, this is not true, and based on their outburst over this, I can guarantee therapy if done has not been sufficient. \n\nIf he told you he can control, cope, or manage it, he is gaslighting you. Gaslighting is manipulation of facts to make you question your sanity or reality. Common ways it is done is telling you something, \"I promise to watch the kids this weekend\" and on Saturday getting mad at you and saying, \"I never said that.\" Every single medical practitioner will tell someone with BPD to medicate. Their is no controlling. This person is dragging you down with toxicity. He is making you believe his lies and world view despite the fact it is medically false. No amount of therapy will fix this. \n\nGet out before it is too late. This man would rather tell his kids to not even say happy mothers Day and ruin your day for his comfort.

He would let you think his kids did not like or love you. That is manipulative and a lie by omission. It is gaslighting as you would question if you really were being a good mother figure. \n\nFinally, the issue is not that he has BPD. The issue is he knows it and intentionally puts himself in a position to have an outburst. The emotional inability to regulate or handle a situation such as a child forgetting mothers day and you being mad is way different than if HE CREATED the entire situation for his selfish benefit. He weaponized his mental illness to manipulate you. Gaslighting to the point you really had to post here and ask if you were an AH for not being happy he ruined the day. \n\nYou deserve a round of applause for stepping into a mom role for someone elses kids.

But it\u2019s probably worth a discussion with calmer heads, considering even the most well managed people with bipolar are sometimes snippy and irrational or say things impulsively. You\u2019re certainly NTA for being upset either way, but there also might be some misunderstanding of context if he\u2019s acting with a hot head and not being rational at the point of time due to bipolar disorder. And if it was a well meant thing he said to the kids to not pressure them if they were having confusing feelings surrounding Mother\u2019s Day, that he communicated poorly to you in a heated moment, I think there\u2019s a big difference than if he said it to avoid having to put effort in himself. \n\nDid the kids bring up feeling obligated to do something but not feeling like they wanted to because of what they know about their relation to you? Did he tell them \u201cyou don\u2019t have to say it if you\u2019re not comfortable\u201d or was it more along the lines of \u201cdon\u2019t bother, she\u2019s not your real mom\u201d? I feel like context matters here, but either way I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the bad guy for being upset. I just think that the context makes a difference for evaluating deeper issues here. \n\nI could totally see kids in their situation getting to the age where they start realizing the real implications of what it means if you\u2019ve always been open about not being their bio mom, particularly for the 6 year old. And for the 10 year old, who likely still has memories of their mom if she was ever in their life, may be starting to feel insecure if some of those older memories of their birth mom are starting to fade, or is just starting to have complex feelings about understanding the situation as they get older. I would maybe sit down with the kids and try to gauge where they\u2019re coming from, if they didn\u2019t say it to you because they didn\u2019t want to for some reason, and dive deeper into that if that\u2019s the case, maybe even consider therapy as a family or for the kids individually to help them work through things if they are having confusing emotions about their mom and their relationship with you. \n\nAlternatively, if Dad told them not to, and if that\u2019s the case it sounds like there\u2019s some element of laziness surrounding celebrating his partner and is using the fact that you\u2019re not their bio mom to avoid putting effort in, even if that\u2019s just the effort to supervise or guide the kids while they do a craft for you.\n\nUltimately I think when dealing with someone with bipolar disorder there\u2019s an element of finesse in recognizing when things are said with malice or impulse due to extreme lows and reapproaching when they\u2019re in a better state of mind. I\u2019ve dealt with a partner with it who frequently said cruel things he didn\u2019t mean or wouldn\u2019t have said if it wasn\u2019t said during a bad day, and then when they were in a better state and mindset would apologize and say they shouldn\u2019t have said it like that, and rephrase in a more kind, logical way and explain the emotions they were dealing with.
