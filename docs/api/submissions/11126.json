Otherwise it will end up skipped over.", "In healthcare and same.", "Canada has to be a nickel cuz we phased out the penny 10 years ago.", "I think copper IS used to make nickels. Copper is used to make dimes, quarters and some types of dollar coins. They are then plated with a different metal. This is done because copper is cheap compared to silver or gold.", "My favorite quote from that movie:\n\nI....will not eat...a single IOTA...of shit!\n\nAnd just as I thought, on further research it turned out to be an improvised line from Michael Shannon.  That scene of all these absolute screen legends improvising losing their marbles all at once was fingerlicking good.", "Was this actually a good movie? I watched the second one and loved up but was told the first one is vastly different.", "A \"plugged nickel\" is one with the center punched out (to recover some metal while retaining the shape/size of the coin). Nobody plugs nickels anymore (generally not worth it for a long, long time), but the vestigial traces in the language still linger (fester?)", "Nah I wouldn't do that.  It sounds like OP doesn't use Keurig at all and have their own thing going.  I would continue doing this and documenting any BS, and probably at some point going to management, if the harassment continues.", "This happened at the office once.. at first it was one employee bringing in their keurig. Before the end of the month, it became a keurig arms-race! HR came in and shut that down by explaining that too many keurig machines posed a fire risk and \"consumed too much electricity\".", "The co-worker wasn't squawking about the flavors or the sweetening.", "Seriously, free coffee and at least some basic level of free snacks was the *only* perk of working in an office! Heck, even the retail store I worked at had a basic coffee pot and grounds for free in the break room.", "Seriously? No where I've ever worked had management pay for coffee! Just imagine the bitching- I don't drink coffee, buy me tea bags! I don't drink caffeine, buy me herbal tea! I don't drink hot beverages, buy me soda! I don't drink soda, buy me water! I don't drink water, buy me whiskey!", "Just because they CAN be, doesn't mean they SHOULD be.", "State government here, and there is literally a law prohibiting using state funds to buy coffee. Everyone brings their own. I went a step further and got my own Keurig for my office.", "Because Canada recognizes that it\u2019s barking mad to spend over two cents per penny minted.  \n\nThe US, on the other hand, refuses to consider this because of \u201creasons.\u201d\n\n-Rat", "Was referring to the color as opposed to actual metal composition.", "Yeah, coppers no longer used other than platting. They're upwards \\~75% zinc and whatever platting used. That's why the whole \"find a penny before 19## is worth more than $.01. Sure there's some collector value but the metal itself is worth more than the coin's value.", "\"don't give them one thin dime\" was something that I always heard, and I'm old.", "It's red dime in the movie.", "Both Benoit Blanc films are extremely good", "The first one is more \"Sherlock Holmes\" while the second was more \"Hercules Poirot/Miss Marple\". The first is a bit more serious as well, while the second one allows for a lot more hijinks.", "I loved the first one! I think I liked it better than the second, which I also really liked.", "I enjoyed both, but liked the first one better.  Same humor, different story.  Great cast as well.", "Great movie. Very modern Agatha Christie-like.", "I didn't like the first one as much.  One of the central \"clues\" of the movie was that the nurse/main suspect couldn't lie.  If she tried, she'd get physically ill.  The writers kept dodging around that limitation when it suited them, though, which really irritated me.  I almost didn't watch Glass Onion since it was the sequel but I really enjoyed it.", "Yea I was under the impression that the phrase was about/almost a hundred years too old! I guess I used to assume it was something others heard, but no one's known what I've meant by that for at least a decade if I happen to muse to myself and say it.", "Yeah those will be fine for a long time! I\u2019d be happy to have some seasonal flavours.", "Every office I\u2019ve ever worked in had an office machine & the Co purchased basic coffee; sugar & creamer. If you wanted anything extra; special or different you were welcome to bring your own.", "Of the 3 office jobs I had, 2 paid for coffee, all 3 had a hot water machine, and the one that didn't have coffee still offered tea bags for free.\n\nThey just stocked them and people had to do without if they didn't like it. If you wanted soda, you paid for it, if you wanted water, you used the sink.", "We have asked about the whiskey thing recently and we're told that we are allowed to purchase 2 drinks at company lunches on the company card, provided we aren't in any dangerous or customer facing positions later on.  Then, they bring us bllunch instead of us going out.", "My boss buys coffee, black and green tea, sugar, cream and milk plus we have water coolers. Anything else and you are on your own and no one has complained. Someone brought in a big box of sweetener packs because he only buys sugar and it seems to magically multiply without drama emails", "The only place that never supplied coffee for the office was a 4 person firm I worked at right out of college. From then on every office I've had supplied coffee. And this one will blow your mind, my most recent office supplies coffee, tea, beer, ciders, alcoholic and non-alcoholic seltzers. Same with all of the places where my friends work. It's not unheard of or even uncommon for management to supply coffee.", "It\u2019s incredibly common for coffee/tea to be supplied by the business. It\u2019s a minimal cost that increases morale and productivity.\n\nMy office has standard coffee, tea, powdered creamer and sweeteners. The few of us that use liquid creamer alternate who buys.", "Most offices where ive worked supply coffee and tea. Better to keep people in the office rather than wandering out to get it elsewhere. Plus it is a cheap morale boost.", "I've only worked in office jobs and everyone at least has black coffee, sugar, and creamer on hand. \n\nSome places get bougie and office flavors, but that's way more rare than just plain black coffee in a drip pot.", "The company I used to work for for years would buy large bags of coffee for us to drink. But we are often working anywhere between 12 to 16 hours a day for months at a time", "Actually on some k-cups they even say they can be used twice.", "Wait the US still has pennies? I thought ya'll phased them out when we did!", ">don't give them one thin dime\" was something that I always heard, and I'm old.\n\nIn the show, he purposely says it wrong. It's either red nickel or dime, I think.", "> and I'm old.\n\nUsed to have to keep a dime (eventually quarter) in my pocket in case I needed to call home from school if I was staying after for some activity, instead of making collect calls.", "Thank you! I thought so", "OMG they're so bad.", "When I was a carpenter, if we even took a sip we were clocked out for the rest of the day.", "Yeah, the company I interned for supplied coffee, canned soft drinks, and LaCroix. It was an unpaid internship; I drank my weight in the damn LaCroix every day.", "I used to make collect calls from the store up the road when we needed something, and when it would ask to state your name, I would just quickly say what I needed. \n\n\u201cWould you accept a collect call from \u2018Me and {friend} got stranded and it\u2019s raining come pick us up?\u2019\u201d\n\nCall would get declined and a few minutes later my mom would show up. \ud83d\ude06", "\"It's-bob-we-had-a-baby-its-a-boy\" no youngens will ever understand that commercial, and it's comic value.", "Yes!! \ud83e\udd23 \u201cHadababay.It\u2019saboy.Mother\u2019sdoin\u2019fine.\u201d", "Gotta love gieco"]}
