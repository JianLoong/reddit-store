We have a 15 year old son together. She married a guy a couple of years later. He has a daughter who is four years older than my son. So my son has known her for about ten years. She has always been nice to him and there has never been any serious arguments between them. My ex and her husband live about an hour and a half from town. So when she got into college they decided they didn't want her commuting three hours a day, especially in Manitoba winters. So they budgeted for her to live with friends while she was in school. \n\nI have known the girl since she was 7 years old. She is an intelligent, charming, and friendly kid. She is also burnt out from school. \n\nI am not going to defend her actions. She lied to my ex and her father about dropping out of college. She did her first semester but she was overwhelmed and dropped out. And she didn't tell them. But she kept the money they sent her for housing and food. \n\nShe should not have lied but I understand why she did. They cut off her funding and told her to get a job. Which is totally fair. If you aren't in school you should be supporting yourself. \n\nShe had enough money to make it to July. She found a job but it didn't pay enough to cover living in the city. Her dad and my ex would not let her move home. \n\nMy son called me to ask if I could help her out. I thought about it and I said I would. I have room in my house. So I told him to have her call me. \n\nWe talked about it and she moved in at the beginning of August. She is paying rent she can afford and buying her own food. She is also doing chores around the house. \n\nMy ex found out what I did and lost it on me. Their plan was for her to be so desperate that she agreed to go back to college with them keeping a much closer eye on her. I screwed everything up by not letting her become homeless in Winnipeg. \n\nHer husband is pissed off with me for interfering with a kid that I'm not related to. I can understand where they are coming from but I think they are not doing the right thing. I just want my son to know she is in a safe place. I also think she will go back to school once she figures out how much it sucks only having a high school diploma. \n\nI didn't know where to add this but before any of you start calling me a pervert or anything, please know that to the best of my knowledge she isn't into people with a Y chromosome. And I'm not into girls young enough to be my daughter.\n\n#EDIT\n\nI knew I forgot something. Her mom and dad's family are all in Alberta.

A lot of parents have the rule that their kids must be enrolled full time in college or they have to support themselves. And let\u2019s be honest, there are way more options between the daughter living with her parents and being \u201chomeless\u201d (including staying with friends or extended family).

Parents don\u2019t have to be monsters because they refuse to support their 19 year old.", "Stop blame your poor mathematics knowledge on booze!!\nI'm drunk and I can easily tell that 15 + 4 is equal to 23.", "I don't do math on weekends. I'll die on that hill.", "Yeah. I caught it, but had to count on my fingers :-p", "Some of us are jealous \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Lmao", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Wait...mathematics?! My dyslexia read it as \"Mething\". Fuck.\n\nAt least that explains why there are bees inside my teeth....", "In this regard, every day feels like Sunday to me \ud83d\ude1c", "I usually don\u2019t say this but those parents are monsters. No place is safe for young homeless people or any gender\u2026 but a homeless 19F in Winnipeg? Do they want her to get killed or trafficked?\n\nIf they won\u2019t let her come home they\u2019ve 100% abdicated their right to commentary on this issue.", "Wait a minute, a young person was afraid of the overreaction of her parents, and so chose to *hide* from them?  Where ever might she have learned how to cope in such a protective and fearful manner??\n\n*all estranged adult children laugh in disgusted pity*\n\nOP is helping her escape the cycle of abuse.  He'san absolute saint.  I hope she'll try to break that cycle fully for herself when she's ready.", "Wait\u2026what??? I was already prepared to vote NTA irrespective of the weather because extreme, dangerous weather is happening everywhere, and being homeless is incredibly unsafe - I\u2019m not from Winnipeg (eastern WA here, so if OUR winters are harsh, y\u2019all\u2019s winters in Alberta and Manitoba are downright scary) \u2014 is this a current story, this landfill situation?? \n\nBefore I forget: NTA, OP. Thank you for giving the kid a soft landing so she can figure things out. That will make a huge difference in the trajectory of her life.", "It\u2019s Canada, and yes she would be paying per class taken. It makes a lot of sense to take a break and evaluate, as you say. University is a big change \u2014 especially from high school in a rural area \u2014 and a lot of young adults don\u2019t connect with it well at first or really know what they want to do. Better to take a break than crash & burn and get kicked out, too.", "They had consequences.  She's damaged the relationship with her parents.  \n\nIt shouldn't be homelessness.  She's 19 and female.  Nothing good would happen.", "No matter how you truly feel, it would seem they became assholes the moment they found out their daughter was safe with a roof over her head and their response was to be angry because they can't manipulate her anymore.", "yes there are conditions to living at home but the point is they were not going to let her move home in the most it says \u201cher dad and my ex would not let her move home\u201d so she was in danger of being homeless. moving provinces is a big deal and we don\u2019t know what her other family is like in alberta and generally alberta is not lgbtq+ friendly. also she could of wanted to go to school but she was burnt out that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want to do the thing it just means your so mentally exhausted from doing the thing that your entire body shuts down. if you can\u2019t have compassion for your daughter that just moved out to give her a safe place to stay you don\u2019t actually care about her. they are monsters for being ok with the daughter not having a safe place to stay.", "They're an adult, not a child anymore, and it would be up to them whether or not (or when) they tell their parents anything.", "Everyone is someone else's kid. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Sometimes you know the parents sometimes you don't. \n\nShe's an adult who didn't want her parents to know, or care if they knew, otherwise she would have told them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Finally another professor in the comments", "you forgot to carry the 1, she is 37.", "I\u2019m no math surgeon but I think your booze is defective.", "Well well well, looks like we've got ourselves a boffin in the comments hahahaha", "Looooooool!!!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to downvote this horrible comment, just need to read to the end\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d", "Save a spot for me haha", "dyscalcula", "There was a relatively recent case where an alleged serial killer was targeting at-risk women (Indigenous women in particular). Following the discovery of one victim whose body was in a landfill last year, it was believed that other victims and missing women were likely there as well. Searching such a landfill is an enormous and expensive task that could take months or even a few years to do effectively.  \n\n\nThe case and general issues surrounding Winnipeg (and larger communities) with issues such as discrimination and the response of authorities is a problem that's been around for a long time.", "I have a feeling that was more about who took her in. If she had moved to Alberta or was sleeping on her friends\u2019 couches, I don\u2019t think the response would have been the same. I think they are upset because she doesn\u2019t have to be accountable for stealing their money and lying to them.", "Fortunately I\u2019m not divorced with this issue so maybe I\u2019m naive to what people ought to do in situations but I think it\u2019s smarter to bring this up in the first place since it\u2019s his ex wife and more serious than filling a summer gap in leases. Also I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t rent her the place, I just think it was short sighted to not mention it at all. Also why I said \u201cish\u201d about AH for OP and not saying he\u2019s a full AH", "NTA NTA - First of all, hello fellow Manitoban!!", "You got to round off the remainder she's 50", "Fully Agree. The parents should have at least allowed her to take a safe breather in their home so that she can get her life back together.", "I'll bring a picnic lunch we can all share if someone else brings a blanket to sit on.", "Except their plan was for her to be so desperate that she had no choice but to go back to college under their terms and their watchful eye, and they were upset that her finding a good place to stay meant they couldn't manipulate her in that way. \n\nConsidering just what we know about her parents from this post, I am in no way surprised that she hid dropping out from them. I'm not surprised she kept the money and used it to support herself, because it has been clear that they would not have supported or helped her in that moment. Yes, it was deceitful on her part \u2014 but she probably felt like she didn't have a choice if she wanted to survive.", "Considering how manipulative her parents are, and that - again - she is an adult now, there's literally nobody who needs to be informed of her whereabouts. Maybe I'm biased because I have a 14 year old and I could *never*, but yeah.", "I've got that covered.", "The parents clearly want her to go back to college. I\u2019m just not sure why their wanting it and choosing not to pay for other options has to be so insidious. Do they want her to see that life is hard with only a high school degree? Sure. OP even acknowledges this reality. However, this does not make them Disney villains. It\u2019s not manipulation. They gave her conditions that she can either accept or not. Also - it\u2019s never okay to lie to get money from anyone... even your parents. If any one was manipulative, it was the daughter.", "I get what your saying and the only reason I think there\u2019s some ownership of the issue is because unilateral decision making about his ex\u2019s step kid could be bad for him and it adds complexity. In all fairness I should say the only AH part is to himself because will probably be getting some undeserved retaliation beyond this argument. Ex and Hubby are still the route of the issue and she should be able to have the roof over her head no matter what."]}
