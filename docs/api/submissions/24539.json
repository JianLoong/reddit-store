We have a 15 year old son together. She married a guy a couple of years later. He has a daughter who is four years older than my son. So my son has known her for about ten years. She has always been nice to him and there has never been any serious arguments between them. My ex and her husband live about an hour and a half from town. So when she got into college they decided they didn't want her commuting three hours a day, especially in Manitoba winters. So they budgeted for her to live with friends while she was in school. \n\nI have known the girl since she was 7 years old. She is an intelligent, charming, and friendly kid. She is also burnt out from school. \n\nI am not going to defend her actions. She lied to my ex and her father about dropping out of college. She did her first semester but she was overwhelmed and dropped out. And she didn't tell them. But she kept the money they sent her for housing and food. \n\nShe should not have lied but I understand why she did. They cut off her funding and told her to get a job. Which is totally fair. If you aren't in school you should be supporting yourself. \n\nShe had enough money to make it to July. She found a job but it didn't pay enough to cover living in the city. Her dad and my ex would not let her move home. \n\nMy son called me to ask if I could help her out. I thought about it and I said I would. I have room in my house. So I told him to have her call me. \n\nWe talked about it and she moved in at the beginning of August. She is paying rent she can afford and buying her own food. She is also doing chores around the house. \n\nMy ex found out what I did and lost it on me. Their plan was for her to be so desperate that she agreed to go back to college with them keeping a much closer eye on her. I screwed everything up by not letting her become homeless in Winnipeg. \n\nHer husband is pissed off with me for interfering with a kid that I'm not related to. I can understand where they are coming from but I think they are not doing the right thing. I just want my son to know she is in a safe place. I also think she will go back to school once she figures out how much it sucks only having a high school diploma. \n\nI didn't know where to add this but before any of you start calling me a pervert or anything, please know that to the best of my knowledge she isn't into people with a Y chromosome. And I'm not into girls young enough to be my daughter.\n\n#EDIT\n\nI knew I forgot something. Her mom and dad's family are all in Alberta.

Nevertheless, I don\u2019t think they are as evil as others in the comments are making them out to be. A lot of parents have the rule that their kids must be enrolled full time in college or they have to support themselves. And let\u2019s be honest, there are way more options between the daughter living with her parents and being \u201chomeless\u201d (including staying with friends or extended family).

Facing unsupportive parents when you\u2019re at the end of your rope is one of the key factors in why young people make terrible choices.
