You simply answered yes, your sister needs to teach her kids that love is love and that\u2019s it.", "NTA, so your sister will openly talk to them about noshing cocks?\nObviously not, and you're not going to go into graphic detail about your sex life either.\n\nYour sister is an asshole because she's suggesting you're some sort of deviant.", "NTA. And you didn't start this, Mum did. \"Have you got a boyfriend?\" You answered quite appropriately. But sis is weird, I like ladies isn't talking about sex acts, it's talking about relationships. If she was so offended by that she should have stamped down on Mum's talking about dick fucking lifestyle...", "NTA by a mile and a half.\n\nYou didn't say anything inappropriate or wrong. Your sister needs to cop on and recognise that they're going to be \"exposed\" to same-sex relationships at some point.

But someone\u2019s gotta break that family dysfunction of prejudice from infecting the next generation and you are the right person for the job!\n\nKids do get it. \n\nYour sister\u2019s reduction of your romantic attractions to a base sexual act is gross but you can ask her to tone down her dick-riding lifestyle a bit if she can\u2019t raise the products of her crude and animalistic fucking to be better persons than she is.", "NTA. Your mother and your sister are both homophobes. At least your sister's children aren't. Yet. I bet your sister will do her best to ruin their innocence.", "NTA - hopefully the kids can keep being educated by you instead of learning from your homophobic sister!", "NTA. You didn't say anything inappropriate, and your mom put you in that position by asking about your love life. It's not like you're going to lie just to keep up the appearance that you're straight.

You handled it well. \nI get the annoying feeling when people ask about boyfriends, tho. Why is it so hard to understand? Anyhow, I think it's great for your nibblings to be able to ask questions, and you answered age appropriately.", "NTA, you obviously don't have to hide anything because of her bigoted opinions.", "Your sister is being ignorant on purpose, she knows perfectly that she's exaggerating to hide her to the LGBTQ. And I hope your kids haven't heard about \"eating cock.\" - NTA", "NTA there was a story similar to this on Two Hot Takes where the OPs sister and brother in law lost it at OP when she mentioned to her nephew that she liked girls and the son was confused and asked age appropriate questions and OP gave age appropriate answers. She was babysitting him if I remember correctly. Their son was excited and told his parents when they got home that OP liked girls and they basically told OP off and that it was disgusting for her to talk about that to their child. Morgan on THT and the co cost she had on basically said that kids are gonna find these things out anyways and it\u2019s best to educate them at home and allow them to understand what happens in the real world and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with OP telling her nephew. I think the reason parents get uncomfortable about telling their kids these things is because an LGBTQ+ person is stigmatised for, whatever reason, around being a sexual being. I personally would prefer if I was the person to talk to my children about LGBTQ+ but then again, I\u2019m also not homophobic so I have no issues educating my kids on the topic.", "NTA, I also hope that she's not telling her kids about her cock sucking life style if talking about love is so scary to her", "NTA, but it really depends on what you said. If it was just bout dating thats fine, anything past that is a problem.", "People like your sister are the weird ones, you simply said yes you\u2019d have a girlfriend and she somehow heard \u201cp*ssy eating\u201d? Your sister is a pervert with a disgusting mind, like every other homophobe out there. NTA, your sister needs mental help instead.", "NTA you were asked a question by curious kids and gave an honest answer, without getting too in depth with what adults do.", "NTA. Even if what you said was inappropriate, it was your mom that actually brought it up. You were just correcting her *once again* from the sounds of it.\n\nI'm a queer parent and your sister is being unacceptably awful. Her kids are going to remember how cool you are when they need someone to be cool to them.", "NTA. She asked you answered", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "what do you refer to by \"this\"?", "NTA. It's important for children to be aware of diverse relationships. Your mother and sister's reaction may be considered as promoting homophobia.", "I'm not sure but i think the mother was joking", "Yes, that and pass that homophobic bitchery down to her kids. OP, you should be wary of change in your niece's behavior, if that happens, it means your sister is filling her head with stupid stuff.", "No need to thank me really. Just giving out my opinion lol", "And maybe u will be the one who teaches them that love is love and it has no borders"]}
