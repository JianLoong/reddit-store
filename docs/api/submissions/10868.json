You took away that space when someone needed it. \n\nShe didn't knock? So what? She could clearly tell it was occupied. She was giving what she reasonably thought was a fellow breastfeeding mom the space to finish without rushing. She obviously didn't expect some random person that shouldn't have been in there.\n\nNeeding space and quiet is understandable. Taking away limited space from someone that needs it isn't.", "YTA and I think you know it. I\u2019m autistic too and I travel often for work. I know the sensory overload can be a lot, but since you\u2019re a frequent traveler you (like me) have no doubt developed some existing coping mechanisms and you\u2019re also probably familiar with the prayer rooms in airports, or how to find a spot to sit with noise cancellation headphones and a book or game for some escapism. Don\u2019t be one of those people with autism who use it as an excuse for bad behavior.", "YTA\n\nYou were preventing her using the lactation pod for its specific purpose. You could easily put on noise cancelling headphones or earplugs and find a less crowded spot in the airport to rest for a while without preventing mothers from using the pods.", "Thank you all for your comments and suggestions. Genuinely. I\u2019m glad that I have outside input and that now I know what I was doing is wrong for sure, I can fix that behavior. Like many have you have suggested, I\u2019ll start packing better, and I\u2019ll also seek out the prayer rooms. Again, thank you so much for the learning opportunity.", "Unfortunately YTA. Find another quiet place, or invest in some sensory dampening equipment such as noise cancelling headphones, etc.", "Tbh, yes, YTA. She You probably made her and some other people uncomfortable. If someone used resources meant to accommodate you and made you wait while you needed them, it would make you upset and uncomfortable. These spaces are designed for breastfeeding, seeing a guy walk out of one without a kid makes people assume the worst.\n\nAirports are rough if you have sensory issues, but not planning properly isn\u2019t a reason to make people who need to use that space for it\u2019s intended purpose wait. While it\u2019s hard to get away from the noises and crowds, using a space designated for breastfeeding mothers is not the best solution.\n\nNext time try to remember bringing a pair of noise cancelling headphones, a fidget/sensory toy, and something to keep you occupied and calm. Planning ahead won\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t get overwhelmed, but it can help prevent things like this next time.", "YTA\n\nThose pods are there for a very specific purpose, one that can't be properly served using other facilities.\n\nMost major airports have chapels or meditation areas that are rarely used by anyone. Seek those out instead.", "Yea you are an asshole. Nursing mothers already go through a hard time looking for safe quiet and private places to feed their babies. There are not many places that have areas for nursing women, some have even sadly resorted to feeding in a bathroom. So when a place, such as a busy airport, has accommodations it\u2019s lovely. But what\u2019s not lovely is then finding some random person coming out of it with no baby. To anyone they\u2019re going to think you\u2019re doing something weird in there. She didn\u2019t knock because it most likely locked and showed in use, she was being respectful to what she thought was a nursing mother. You give a nursing baby piece and quiet so that they can focus on eating. \nPlease respect nursing mothers and their babies by not using accommodations made for them.", "I'd say gentle YTA. I understand being overwhelmed and needing a bit of calm in stressful places/situations, but those pods have a specific purpose, and you prevented someone from using it for that purpose. She probably didn't knock because she knows that people need time to feed their children in peace, ie the purpose behind the pods.   \n\n\nI can understand needing a quiet space, but airports often have dedicated quiet spaces, especially if they are the type to have lactation pods. Next time, maybe try looking up the airport ahead of time and seeing if they one of the spaces with that intended purpose.", "I understand, but gentle YTA. It's so hard to breastfeed and 5 minutes can make such a difference in the process.", "Tough one but have to say YTA.\n\nI'm the same, have ASD and hate crowds, loud noises, itchy clothes etc.\n\nUsually I make sure I take stuff like headphones, iPad, fidget spinner and that so that I can try and stay chill. Might be worth finding what else works for you.", "As a fellow autistic person, YTA. I get it. I hate loud noises and crowds too. But get some ear defenders, or some noise-cancelling headphones and play some music if you don't need to hear anything. Try to find a more isolated area while blocking out the noise that way. Don't take a space intended for a specific use away from people that were meant to use it in the first place. My ear defenders helped me a lot on campus whenever I'd have to go past things like construction, it made loud noise more manageable. If you're super desperate, find a restroom. Don't take a space away that's meant for people to feed their babies.", "Soft YTA. Not lactating, not nursing, then do not use. Breastfeeding is stigmatized badly enough, those are safe spaces so children can be fed privately in them rather than a restroom stall if a mother is not comfortable nursing in public, or infant is fussy.", "YTA for not immediately vacating the pod when you saw that someone was waiting to use it for its intended purpose. You took a chance on nobody wanting to use it but as soon as someone did you should have been out of there PDQ. It would be worth your while investing in some noise-cancelling headphones and/or ear defenders if this is going to be a regular thing.", "Of course you are.

It can be incredibly stressful to not have a place to do that, and it would definitely make me upset as a mother if I was in a situation where my baby was hungry and someone who was not using that space as intended stepped out after I had been waiting. 5 minutes doesn\u2019t seem like a long time, but if the baby is hungry or you\u2019re in physical pain from needing to pump or feed, 5 minutes can feel like a lifetime. \n\nI do think that many people may have not considered a need for something similar for a person with sensory issues, and there should definitely be a dedicated space for people like you who may need it.

While privacy is a huge factor, there\u2019s actually also a health need. Delays in nursing or pumping can cause really painful clogs and infections, but more commonly it can actually lead to a reduced milk supply. And of course if a baby is hungry, it\u2019s hungry then!

That's one reason why for some mothers, the lactation pods are necessary. Another may be that it may provide quiet time for overstimulating environments for a baby. \n\nAt the same time, in an ideal world people with high sensory issues should have a space to discharge and regulate.

When I go to busy spaces, outside or inside, I wear noise canceling earplugs (Loop brand, highly recommend), and my ND kids also wear headphones. I wear tinted glasses to help block bright indoor lights, chew minty gum so the smell is pleasant, and wear half gloves (with finger tips out) to avoid touching things unnecessarily. \n\nDo people look at me weird?

I\u2019m also autistic and I can see why you want to use that space if it\u2019s not otherwise in use, but the problem with a space like that is that someone is not going to barge in and ask if you\u2019re breastfeeding and if not can they use it to breastfeed. They\u2019re going to assume it is being used for its sole purpose (which is in its name) and be respectful of a nursing person, knowing that stress etc can hamper lactation. A good point has also been made about the fact pumping needs a clean space and the more a space is used, the less clean it is (germs etc). \n\nI grew up in an era where autism was less understood and there weren\u2019t sensory rooms available, so I have developed other coping mechanisms and there is a lot you can try. I almost always use earbuds/headphones to block out sound and also will almost always block out light as much as possible whilst in transit, so on a plane or train etc. Finding quieter public spaces in the airport helps me, like taking myself for a walk to a further part of it where there are less people, or buying a drink and using a restaurant booth if it\u2019s quiet. I also always try to sit against walls / in corners if possible, so I\u2019m limiting my sensory input around me. \n\nThere are options, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking the feedback on board and changing your actions in future.", "YTA", "YTA and you know it.
