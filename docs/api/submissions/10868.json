You took away that space when someone needed it. \n\nShe didn't knock? So what? She could clearly tell it was occupied. She was giving what she reasonably thought was a fellow breastfeeding mom the space to finish without rushing. She obviously didn't expect some random person that shouldn't have been in there.\n\nNeeding space and quiet is understandable. Taking away limited space from someone that needs it isn't.", "YTA and I think you know it. I\u2019m autistic too and I travel often for work. I know the sensory overload can be a lot, but since you\u2019re a frequent traveler you (like me) have no doubt developed some existing coping mechanisms and you\u2019re also probably familiar with the prayer rooms in airports, or how to find a spot to sit with noise cancellation headphones and a book or game for some escapism. Don\u2019t be one of those people with autism who use it as an excuse for bad behavior.", "YTA\n\nYou were preventing her using the lactation pod for its specific purpose. You could easily put on noise cancelling headphones or earplugs and find a less crowded spot in the airport to rest for a while without preventing mothers from using the pods.", "Thank you all for your comments and suggestions. Genuinely. I\u2019m glad that I have outside input and that now I know what I was doing is wrong for sure, I can fix that behavior. Like many have you have suggested, I\u2019ll start packing better, and I\u2019ll also seek out the prayer rooms. Again, thank you so much for the learning opportunity.", "Unfortunately YTA. Find another quiet place, or invest in some sensory dampening equipment such as noise cancelling headphones, etc.", "Tbh, yes, YTA. She You probably made her and some other people uncomfortable. If someone used resources meant to accommodate you and made you wait while you needed them, it would make you upset and uncomfortable. These spaces are designed for breastfeeding, seeing a guy walk out of one without a kid makes people assume the worst.\n\nAirports are rough if you have sensory issues, but not planning properly isn\u2019t a reason to make people who need to use that space for it\u2019s intended purpose wait. While it\u2019s hard to get away from the noises and crowds, using a space designated for breastfeeding mothers is not the best solution.\n\nNext time try to remember bringing a pair of noise cancelling headphones, a fidget/sensory toy, and something to keep you occupied and calm. Planning ahead won\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t get overwhelmed, but it can help prevent things like this next time.", "YTA\n\nThose pods are there for a very specific purpose, one that can't be properly served using other facilities.\n\nMost major airports have chapels or meditation areas that are rarely used by anyone. Seek those out instead.", "Yea you are an asshole. Nursing mothers already go through a hard time looking for safe quiet and private places to feed their babies. There are not many places that have areas for nursing women, some have even sadly resorted to feeding in a bathroom. So when a place, such as a busy airport, has accommodations it\u2019s lovely. But what\u2019s not lovely is then finding some random person coming out of it with no baby. To anyone they\u2019re going to think you\u2019re doing something weird in there. She didn\u2019t knock because it most likely locked and showed in use, she was being respectful to what she thought was a nursing mother.

I understand being overwhelmed and needing a bit of calm in stressful places/situations, but those pods have a specific purpose, and you prevented someone from using it for that purpose. She probably didn't knock because she knows that people need time to feed their children in peace, ie the purpose behind the pods.   \n\n\nI can understand needing a quiet space, but airports often have dedicated quiet spaces, especially if they are the type to have lactation pods. Next time, maybe try looking up the airport ahead of time and seeing if they one of the spaces with that intended purpose.", "I understand, but gentle YTA.

Might be worth finding what else works for you.", "As a fellow autistic person, YTA. I get it. I hate loud noises and crowds too. But get some ear defenders, or some noise-cancelling headphones and play some music if you don't need to hear anything. Try to find a more isolated area while blocking out the noise that way. Don't take a space intended for a specific use away from people that were meant to use it in the first place. My ear defenders helped me a lot on campus whenever I'd have to go past things like construction, it made loud noise more manageable. If you're super desperate, find a restroom. Don't take a space away that's meant for people to feed their babies.", "Soft YTA. Not lactating, not nursing, then do not use. Breastfeeding is stigmatized badly enough, those are safe spaces so children can be fed privately in them rather than a restroom stall if a mother is not comfortable nursing in public, or infant is fussy.", "YTA for not immediately vacating the pod when you saw that someone was waiting to use it for its intended purpose. You took a chance on nobody wanting to use it but as soon as someone did you should have been out of there PDQ. It would be worth your while investing in some noise-cancelling headphones and/or ear defenders if this is going to be a regular thing.", "Of course you are.

It can be incredibly stressful to not have a place to do that, and it would definitely make me upset as a mother if I was in a situation where my baby was hungry and someone who was not using that space as intended stepped out after I had been waiting. 5 minutes doesn\u2019t seem like a long time, but if the baby is hungry or you\u2019re in physical pain from needing to pump or feed, 5 minutes can feel like a lifetime. \n\nI do think that many people may have not considered a need for something similar for a person with sensory issues, and there should definitely be a dedicated space for people like you who may need it.

While privacy is a huge factor, there\u2019s actually also a health need. Delays in nursing or pumping can cause really painful clogs and infections, but more commonly it can actually lead to a reduced milk supply. And of course if a baby is hungry, it\u2019s hungry then!

I meant to mean by \u2018as per usual\u2019 as more of a \u2018usually when in a crowded area\u2019 , not necessarily as when I travel. But  I see now that I should have worded that better, thanks!", "As I said earlier, I am a minor, and sadly cannot own a airline membership. I also mentioned that I was autistic to explain why I need to take breaks from crowds.", "I agree, I was just adding context to the situation", "Using the toilet usually won't take a long time. I don't think people should use disabled toilets unless they absolutely can't hold in longer. \n\nMost disabled stalls don't have handwashing areas or mirrors. How was she able to put on a full face of makeup in a stall?", "I'm sure you're unaware of this but women who have to pump breast milk need as clean of environment as possible. So the more use those areas get the less clean they are. \n\nThat's not to say that you are in particularly dirty but that the more frequent something is used the higher chance of pathogens.\n\nObviously it's not a sterile room but the fewer people who use them the cleaner they will be. So it's not just about you being in there when someone else needs it it's about creating more foot traffic for an area that really needs to stay as clean as possible.\n\n\nEdit: mothers who are directly breastfeeding also need to clean environment but when you pump it's a much higher priority because you're trying to store the milk long term", "Your wording is not your issue here. Your choice to focus on lactation pods instead of the other quiet options offered to you (chapels, lounges) is the problem. YTA but please use this opportunity to learn.", "Use the prayer rooms /chapels for a quiet break, if they aren\u2019t heavily occupied when you stick your head in. No membership required.\n\nYou messed up, though you didn\u2019t intend to. I\u2019m not blaming you for having done it before you knew better.   \n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve asked and been answered, modify your behaviour. \n\nThink of it as a resource allocation issue: there\u2019s very few places for comfortable breast-feeding, let alone pumping. There\u2019s alternative places for you, ranging from the less pleasant (stalls in a toilet) to the more pleasant (prayer rooms, lounges, empty gates).", "\u201cOn the other side of 18\u201d implies over 18 to me, you\u2019re 17 then?", "You don\u2019t need a membership. Most lounges you can pay for day access", "The prayer rooms and chapels are not age restricted. They are usually very quiet and sparsly used. If you sit their quietly, anyone else will think you are praying.", "There are memberships for using the business lounges. Like DragonPass and a few others. I don\u2019t think they are age restricted", "If you haven't already (apologies if you have and I'm preaching to the converted) then look into some noise-cancelling headphones. I have a Bose set which are great and I know of some autistic people who use them and are very enthusiastic. They don't cut out all sound but they make noisy environments like airport terminals, train stations, etc much less overwhelming. I haven't tried mine on a plane yet but I have high hopes for them making air travel more bearable.", "This. Travelling with pumped milk can also be super stressful as not all airport employees know the rules, and traveling away while nursing a child can be a big emotional mess of its own.", "No, the other side", "I\u2019m 16, yes.", "I\u2019ll look into it! I\u2019m starting my first summer job this year so I\u2019ll get a pair when I earn enough money to get them!", "Have the rules changed? Because I was a frequent flier member of several different airlines before I turned 18.", "You can use prayer rooms. They are quiet spaces where you can sit down and be silent. You don't need to make eye contact with anyone, there's usually a tap where you can wash your hands, even take off shoes if that's your thing. As long as you keep your head down and be respectful of anyone else in that space, everyone will leave you alone. No one can even ask you what your religion is. That's a space appropriate for you to use. \n\nNot the breastfeeding space, which isn't appropriate to use of your aren't feeding an infant or pumping.\n.", "Hi OP! I\u2019d research your airline\u2019s policy on this. I fly Delta and their SkyMiles program not only allows for users under 18, but based on their policy it sounds like even under 13 year olds can join with their parent\u2019s permission! ([SkyMiles policy](https://www.delta.com/us/en/skymiles/program-resources/program-rules) I also got my SkyMiles account when I was 17 (I\u2019m 18 now) so you should be able to get a membership with your airline!", "Next time just use the prayer section in airports. That\u2019s for everyone, just be quiet and dont interfere.", "I just googled the policy for Delta SkyMiles (just picked them cuz that\u2019s the airline I fly) and it sounds like p much anyone regardless of age can sign up for a SkyMiles membership. It says that if a user is under 13 then their parent has to fill out the form for them but there\u2019s nothing preventing membership for under 13 y/os so op should have no problem registering", "They could sign up for delta sky miles, but you have to be 18 to purchase a delta sky club membership to access the lounge"]}
