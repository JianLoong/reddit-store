He doesn\u2019t get my flowers for our anniversary, my birthday or any other special day of the years and i just really wanted flowers for valentine\u2019s day.\n\nThe day come up and we go out to eat and do other fun stuff, but the whole day i was waiting for him to surprise me with flowers. Instead at the end of our dinner he tells me he has a surprise and it\u2019s end up being a pair of earrings. They weren\u2019t really my style but i still tried to be really grateful for what he got me. When we got home i couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and asked my husband about the flowers. He said he didn\u2019t get them and I responded by saying i would rather have them than these ugly earring.

I just want to make some clarifications. I paid for our activities and he paid for the dinner. I also did explicitly say i wanted flowers, which is why said it was an exception to our rule. I didn\u2019t get him a gift because we both unanimously agreed that we wouldn\u2019t exchange gifts. I even showed him a bouquet of daisies at the grocery store that were around $15 he could get me. I got so angry because flowers were he one thing i\u2019ve been begging him to get me since the begging of our relationship and he\u2019s only gotten me flowers once.\n\nanother edit since a lot of people are confused \n*** He came up with the idea for no gifts because we get each other gift all year. When we talked about i told him that was okay and all i wanted were the flowers. He also agreed to that!

You shouldn\u2019t have called them ugly, but you\u2019re clearly frustrated and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not listening to your needs. I would sit your husband down and tell him that you appreciate that he got you something and you\u2019re sorry for calling them ugly, but you feel frustrated that he didn\u2019t listen to your wants, flowers would make you happiest and in the future, you would appreciate flowers instead.", "Reading your description, it sounds like you did NOT explicitly ask for flowers for Valentine's Day.

Now, I don't know if that was him not listening, or you not communicating clearly. Maybe it's some of both. Regardless, y'all gotta talk about how you communicate.

He always came up with something he thought I\u2019d like and I\u2019d come up with something I thought he would like.", "Getting a gift that proves how little someone listens to you, knows you and cares about you is worse than no gift at all.", "YTA for being upset that your husband bought you something, didn't buy you something, all while not buying anything for your husband. \n\nINFO: when was the last time you bought flowers for your husband?", "YTA and you sound like a brat.", "NTA", "NTA i'm not gonna jump to divorce but you might benefit from some couple's therapy.", "NTA.

He doesn\u2019t care what you want.", "NTA", "EAH \n\nYes, he should have listened but maybe he thought the earrings were better. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you get him anything? Y\u2019all made a deal to not get each other anything but spend quality time together\u2026but\u2026no, he had to get you flowers.

Or maybe something a little more than flowers.  In a guy's mind, he's thinking he got you something of more value that you will hopefully remember.  It's not that he didn't listen, but most woman receive so many flowers in their life that they don't even remember most of them.  Possibly he wanted to get you something that would stick out.  BTW, did you get him anything?   I gotta say, if my wife ever got attitude over a present I bought her, I guarantee the next year, I would get her a mop.", "As a follow-up, I noticed a few posts about a husband not recognizing \"needs\"... This isn't help around the house or emotional support.  They are flowers.  They are a nice surprise but hardly a \"need\".   Don't get me wrong, I enjoy surprising my wife with flowers throughout the year but I detest doing it on Valentine's day just because it's \"expected\".", "ESH\n\nYou decided he wouldn't get a gift, but you would?  Lame. And he can't even listen to the most basic request in the world for valentine's day in a simple bouquet of daisies?  Also lame.  You both kinda suck on a sucky holiday.", "Yeah I feel like it\u2019s a common stereotype that women are never direct about what they want or even don\u2019t know what they want. \n\nBut then Op here has communicated several times what she wants to her husband, and he has yet to do it. She\u2019s not even asking anything hard to do smh.", "He didn\u2019t try, though, did he? Trying would have meant listening to what she said.

I think it mag be warranted though especially if there have been multiple instances where he doesn\u2019t listen to OP.", "It is like she said \"Flowers would make me happy\" and he goes \"i don't want to make you happy\". He knew what she wanted, she told it to him so clear, but he behave as if he knew better what she wants or if he simple doesn't care - \"be grateful that i get you anything at all\" is so often the motto of partner who just buys something without any thought. \n\nNTA", "Agreed I'm curious why he blatantly ignored her wishes and got her something completely different.", "I'm the kind of guy who thinks flowers are useless, and I have oddly strong feelings about it - I'm fine spending ten times the time and money it would take to get flowers, but I won't get flowers.  However, I explicitly told my girlfriend this early in our relationship - she knows that if she wants flowers, she has to buy them herself (unromantic as that is).\n\nIMO OP's husband should have communicated with her about this in advance, but now that she knows what he's like, if she keeps expecting flowers from him and keeps being disappointed, it's her fault.", "She admits she decided that only she would be getting a gift.", "I think you mean ESH (Everybody Sucks Here) - I don\u2019t think it will count your ETA (even though TA is how the other judgements end)", "As per OP's comments, he was the one who didn't want gifts. But OP asked for inexpensive flowers and even specified which ones. Love isn't transactional and OP shouldn't be guilted for daring to want $15 flowers even if the husband wanted nothing. The husband did not listen and was not thoughtful for YEARS but you defended him while calling OP a selfish woman who gives every woman a bad name. Wtf??? \n\nOP, you are absolutely NTA. I'm sorry your husband didn't listen. Next year, buy yourself a nice bouquet of your favorite flowers. It's ok to treat yourself, too.", "Wtf, are you the shitty husband or just someone\u2019s shitty SO.

So he did know.\n\nAfter years of her always asking for flowers and never getting them, this would be upsetting as he\u2019s just ignoring her preferences at that point.\n\nIf it was a one off of him wanting to surprise her with a keepsake/jewellery etc then fine, lovely thoughtful husband. The fact she asks for flowers every time.. maybe she does actually want flowers you know? She even told him what kind as they\u2019re her favourite flower. \nHe\u2019s TA for listening to his wife about as well as you read her post.", "He did something thoughtful and you were rude.  How is that not being an AH?", "Sounds like he should do better", "Think about that.  They agreed to split costs on activities and dinner with cheap flowers thrown in.

When we talked about this all i asked for was some flowers and he agreed. That\u2019s it. He agreed to getting me flowers and instead got the complete opposite of what specified and wanted. I would get him a gift but he himself said he does NOT WANT ANYTHING", "If you are specifically asking for a specific book and people are ignoring you then they suck.", "I don't think asking for daisies one day a year is wanting to be the centre of the universe lmao.

But he\u2019s only gotten me flowers once in the 8 years we\u2019ve been together and i\u2019ve been asking for them all the time. It just feels like he deliberately ignored my ask.

Far more considerate than the husband was in this instance.  I'm not saying he shouldn't get her what she asked for.   I'm saying for whatever reason he did he decided to get her the earrings.  That was his right.  She had the right to want flowers he had the right to get her something else.  Instead of being happy she got anything at all she is mad that she didn't get what she wanted.\n\n\"Because he didn't even care enough to get her a pair she would have loved\"How do you know this?
