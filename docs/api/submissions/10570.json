My only exception was that he get me flowers for the day, nothing expensive or crazy just a small bouquet of daisies my favorite flower. \nI\u2019ve always been vocal about my desire for flowers once in a while and try to make it easy for him to understand what I want. He doesn\u2019t get my flowers for our anniversary, my birthday or any other special day of the years and i just really wanted flowers for valentine\u2019s day.\n\nThe day come up and we go out to eat and do other fun stuff, but the whole day i was waiting for him to surprise me with flowers. Instead at the end of our dinner he tells me he has a surprise and it\u2019s end up being a pair of earrings. They weren\u2019t really my style but i still tried to be really grateful for what he got me. When we got home i couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and asked my husband about the flowers. He said he didn\u2019t get them and I responded by saying i would rather have them than these ugly earring. I will admit my words were really harsh, but i\u2019m really tired of him not listening and ignoring what i really want. \n\nSo AITA for telling my husband i hate my valentines gift\n\n***Edit: Since reddit won\u2019t let me respond to anyone of the comments. I just want to make some clarifications. I paid for our activities and he paid for the dinner. I also did explicitly say i wanted flowers, which is why said it was an exception to our rule. I didn\u2019t get him a gift because we both unanimously agreed that we wouldn\u2019t exchange gifts. I even showed him a bouquet of daisies at the grocery store that were around $15 he could get me. I got so angry because flowers were he one thing i\u2019ve been begging him to get me since the begging of our relationship and he\u2019s only gotten me flowers once.", "created_utc": 1677012148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118egro/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_hate_my_valentines/", "score": 32, "replies": ["You were clear in what you wanted.

Just trying to figure out the extent you both have actually talked about this and the meaning it has for you.", " Never to get someone small bouquet of flowers (when they have requested it) is so odd to me. You were straight forward in communicating this with him. He doesn't have much of an excuse here. \n\nNTA.", "Meh I'm gonna go with NTA but judging by your post your husband seems like the kind of guy that things flowers are useless since you keep begging and he instead gets you something material like earing that he thinks you will \"use\". Next time get yourself the flowers and make a display of how much you like them i.e post them to social, keep them around for awhile. He doesn't understand what they mean to you despite your pleas for them, hopefully he clues in. Goodluck \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "ETA. This is tough. On one hand, he went and found something that reminded him of you. You then called his gift 'ugly' and rejected it that same night, right after your quality time together... On the other hand, I understand he hasn't been listening to your desire for flowers and that is probably frustrating.", "NTA, the issue here is that you have explicitly stated exactly what you\u2019d like and told him your favorite flowers. It\u2019s nice or whatever that he got you earrings, but the issue is that he is NOT listening to you.. especially the fact that he\u2019s never gotten you flowers for any other occasion. I understand why other people are commenting Y.T.A. but I don\u2019t believe they really understand. It is very hard and conflicting when you express how badly you want something, and then have to accept something else, knowing that they chose not to get you what they wanted because \u201cthey thought they knew better\u201d. You shouldn\u2019t have called them ugly, but you\u2019re clearly frustrated and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not listening to your needs. I would sit your husband down and tell him that you appreciate that he got you something and you\u2019re sorry for calling them ugly, but you feel frustrated that he didn\u2019t listen to your wants, flowers would make you happiest and in the future, you would appreciate flowers instead.", "Reading your description, it sounds like you did NOT explicitly ask for flowers for Valentine's Day. You've just been vocal in the past and that is vague.\n\nSo yes, you are the asshole for hating your husband's thoughtful gift just because you were expecting flowers.", "ESH. He probably assumed that the earrings would be better than flowers, which was a bad move on his part but I doubt it was malicious in nature. Did you do anything special for him? Why is he the only one expected to make a gesture like that?\n\nThis is why I don't celebrate Valentine's Day.

So basically you are saying \" I am not gifting you, but I expect and demand you buy me flowers\"\n\nOne sided here aren't you?\n\nYou don't want to gift him, but want to be gifted. And then you make a demand on what the gift should be, and then when he gives you something else, you throw a fit, and put down the gift he gave you.\n\nIf I were married to you, you would never get another gift from me again. You sound selfish and ungrateful, and honestly are the type of woman who gives us other women a bad name. \n\nMen put in a effort and get shit on, because it wasn't exactly what you demanded.", "How many times have you bought him flowers?", "YTA valentine's day is the worst. Seems like he tried to go above and beyond, but missed the mark. If the earrings were your style you probably wouldn't have even mentioned the flowers. Exchange them and encourage him not to adlib romantic gestures again in the future??", "ESH. You were less than gracious about the gift he got you (in violation of your agreement, I know). The real issue here is that he doesn't listen to you (or value what you say enough to do it). If you want to fix your marriage here, try couples therapy. Otherwise you just have to buy your own flowers.", "YTA. You didn't unanimously decide to not gift exchange. You decreed \"I'm not getting you anything but I still expect 'flowers'\". He probably thought that was some kind of code for \"you better get me something\". And then you complained about it when earrings around valentines are EXPENSIVE.", "Yes your the A-hole. He should break up with your ungrateful ass", "YTA. You spend the entire day having fun together and instead of focusing on the great time you yourself said you had, you threw it aside because he got you earrings instead of flowers? He saw those earrings and thought you'd like them, so he got them in lieu of daisies.\n\nYou need to get your priorities sorted and apologise.", "ETA.  He\u2019s an idiot for not listening to you, but you\u2019re the AH for responding that way.", "YTA because you \"agreed\" to not get each other gifts, but expected to be surprised with a gift of flowers. \n\nJust buy yourself the stupid flowers.", "ESH\n\nYour hubby should have listened. You should have just accepted the earrings as a nice gift & talked to him about it a couple days later. Not about the earrings being nice or not, but the fact that he missed the flowers. \n\nClearly you two weren't on the same page. Now, I don't know if that was him not listening, or you not communicating clearly. Maybe it's some of both. Regardless, y'all gotta talk about how you communicate. Also, maybe there's something he doesn't like about buying flowers. If it's something you bring up often and he never does, see if you can talk through why he doesn't like getting them. \n\nAlso, don't make the rule \"no gifts, except you have to buy me flowers\". Get your fella something small and nice too so that he feels appreciated.", "YTA - I don\u2019t understand the whole \u201cwe agreed not to get each other gifts\u201d when you \u201cexplicitly\u201d asked him to get you flowers\u2026 \n\nIf you have to tell someone to buy you flowers and they do it\u2019s not a thoughtful gesture.

I appreciate it may not have been a great gift for you but he tried nonetheless.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person but I think you\u2019ve completely missed the mark on social etiquette.", "Yes. You're an asshole.", "YTA- for real, you\u2019re grown. Buy your own flowers if they\u2019re that important.

I do not know why you have to express gratitude for getting something more expensive that you are going to hate, instead of the thing that would of made you happy. To me, it shows a complete dismissal and disregard to the person they profess to love. They are getting you what they want to get, regardless of your feelings on the matter and to me, it just feels like they are not listening, caring or respecting you as a person.

Yes, if you constantly mention you want flowers on special occasions and he doesn't do it, he's being an asshole.

It makes me wonder what other areas of your relationship this behavior is bleeding into.
