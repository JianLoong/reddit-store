Just because the two of you are together doesn't mean you have to be joined together at the hip. \n\nYou should be able to play catch-up with your friends while she attends her girlfriend's wedding.

People act like they will die without their SO for 24 hours and it\u2019s confusing to me. Like he wants to go there, she wants to go here\u2026.. so why don\u2019t they go? She isn\u2019t working and isn\u2019t paying for anything? Why does he have to leave his friends to go see hers for days AND foot the bill.
