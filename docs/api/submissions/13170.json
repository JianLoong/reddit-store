In fact I have already been to three weddings with her traveling about 7 hours in my car for one. She has been to one with me as well.\n\nI told her I want to considering staying at wedding A and letting her go to wedding B herself for the above reasons.

This seems like a possible maturity issue. Ask her how she would feel if roles were reversed and you were only staying at her friends wedding for about 24 hours and then going to your friends for the whole weekend. If you\u2019ve already committed to seeing these friends then that is that. She is an adult and about to travel on her own to her friends wedding.

You'll have time with your friends, but your girlfriend will have to deal with the questions of where you are and why she's alone and the potential judgements of \"Wow what an asshole he is! Why are you even with him?!\" (there's always those people). Not to mention the wonder of what you're getting up to.

I think it is great you would go and pay if it were another time, but in this situation you should not have to give up your weekend.
