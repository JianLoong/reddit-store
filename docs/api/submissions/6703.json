Here it goes.\n\nMy (36F) wife (33F) and I have two kids (6 y/o M and 5 y/o F). The holiday season is over so the kids are back at school. The other day I received a call from our kids' school, saying that they were in a fight and that I was to come and pick them up. I was at work and I couldn't leave right then.\n\nI called my wife, who was with her parents for the day, 3 hours away, which I had totally forgotten about momentarily. And she said that I was to immediately leave work and go pick our kids up.\n\nI couldn't, my wife was too far away, so I wrote a note explaining that I couldn't be there and sent my driver to go pick up the kids. I called in advance and let the school know. They understood and the kids went back home with the driver. I also called our nanny and arranged for her to be home when the kids arrived.\n\nI went to school and talked to the principal. Apparently some kids (those kids were older than ours) were teasing our kids for having two moms and when our kids tried to explain how every family is different (we taught them that way back in the day), the other kids had said some mean words and things had gotten out of hand. Our kids basically got in a verbal fight with them. Even the teacher said I should be proud of our kids and how they were raised.\n\nWhen I got home, I was confronted by my wife, my MIL and my FIL who went ballistic on me because I didn't go pick up the kids myself. I tried to explain that I couldn't go but they weren't having it at all. \n\nMy MIL hates me for some reason so she went all the way to make it seem like I was a monster. My wife was also very angry with me. My FIL called me an irresponsible workaholic who didn't deserve his daughter (that wouldn't be a first). My wife did shut him down but went on to tell me she expected me to be there myself after they were gone. \n\nAm I the AH in this situation?", "created_utc": 1673092253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105n9uj/aita_for_sending_the_driver_to_pick_up_our_kids/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your partners family is not a fan of yours at all. I read above you\u2019re a neurosurgeon. Working in medical it\u2019s understood that sometimes strangers have to take priority. You have a very important job. You took the time to make sure they were picked up and they\u2019d be safe and cared for. You did the due diligence of going to the school and speaking to someone about the issue. You\u2019ve clearly raised smart and strong children. Be proud of that. You need to have a conversation with your wife about how much her parents are allowed to be involved in your household issues. They ATA for involving themselves like that. They clearly treat you poorly, and the fact your wife lets them then brings them into a situation like this as \u201cback up\u201d is disrespectful to you on so many levels. As your wife she should understand the constraints your profession puts on you in situations like this. \n\nYou are NTA!!!!", "NTA. Not everyone has a job that they can just drop what they are doing and leave all because some other peoples kids are ignorant. And you still went to the school when you could. You did the most reasonable thing you could in the circumstances. Sounds like you have some pretty crappy in laws. Sorry to hear that", "NTA. If you're a neurosurgeon, people should understand that it's an important job that requires flexibility in your availability. And you can't just leave whenever you feel like it. You made sure that they were picked up by someone you trusted, you ensured that someone trustworthy was going to be there to take care of your child at home, and you made sure to let the school know what was going to happen so they were not worried when someone else came to pick them up. You did quite a bit to ensure the safety of your child given the circumstances. \n\n\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`\\`  \n\n\nINFO: Their reactions seem a bit intense for the context given. So, I'm wondering if this sort of thing has happened before? Or how often something like this happens? (where work comes first, etc). What is the nature of your job?", "NTA.  You couldn't leave straight away and you sorted out an alternative who could get there quicker. You also arranged the nanny to be home when kids arrived. So you covered all bases and went to the school to talk to the teacher when you left work.", "NTA - you explained the situation and then went to talk to the principal in person as soon as you could.  It sounds like you have a pretty serious job which likely pays for the lifestyle everyone is so accustomed to. There are sacrifices that come along with that one of which is you not having the luxury of just dropping everything at a moments notice. It wasn\u2019t an emergency. Nobody was hurt. You handled the situation the best way you could in that moment. Your wife needs to be more understanding of your role and honestly tell her parents to mind their business. They ATA here. They have no right to speak to you that way, this situation is a household matter and they need to butt out. The fact that your wife allows them to speak to you this way speaks volumes about her and how much respect she has for you.", "NTA. You literally could NOT leave work. Your in laws suck. INFO: why does your wife think you could have left work?", "Nta. You got the kids.", "Shame them back that they didn't care for children/grandchildren enough and left you who had 2 ops to do to sort everything out and go to the school. Your wife is awful.", "NTA \n\nOp is no th ah at all, they couldn't go themselves and ensured the children were collected and safe and went to school ad soon as they could.", "NTA. It's was no like they were in immediate danger.", "Does your wife not work? Who in the world doesn't understand that a working parent can't always drop everything to rush to the school?? You coordinated the driver and nanny and handled a school emergency when your wife was out of town. I'd get a marriage therapist and work this out in therapy. NTA", "Info: why couldn't you have called the nanny to pick them up?", "NTA\nNot sure where you are but where I am there's room for 2 parents as contacts and then 2 other adults as emergency pick up contacts (so 4 different people altogether). \nIt great that you managed to have someone pick up the kids & keep them safe while juggling your job.", "NTA. You couldn't leave work yourself so you sent a trusted person to pick them up and bring them up. I don't see where the problem is.", "INFO\n\ndose your wife have a job.\n\nEDIT \n\n because i thought you did the responsible thing you  where at work and you could not leave because she is a neurosurgeon so you called  your driver who is not a random person to go pick them up and you found someone to  take cear of the kid when you where not there NTA", "I find this situation bizarre. Basically the school called you to pick up your kids from school because *they were being teased.* OR, there are missing details and your children acted inappropriately and were sent home from school for bad behaviour. \n\nI understand why you couldn't pick up the kids, but I don't understand why you don't have a designated emergency contact, such as the nanny.  \n\nThe attitude of your wife and your in-laws is a whole other issue, but for now, on a practical level, you need to set up an emergency contact list in case you can't pick up the kids from school, because sending a driver is not really appropriate or practical. Secondly, you need to sit down with the school principal and teachers and find out what really happened. Your children shouldn't be sent home because someone else is teasing them; if they are being sent home for their own behaviour, then you need to face that squarely.", "This is a bit tough without more context. Fighting, especially around defending your family can be hurtful to kids. Also by the wording in your post it sounds like the driver is a trusted person and not just a random Uber?\n\nWere you able so spend time with them and comfort them once you were home? Did you inform the nanny so that she could help and be a bit more sensitive?\n\nNTA for not picking them up right away. But also INFO needed - as this is more than just a \u201cget the kids from point a to point b\u201d scenario.", "im gonna go with nta, becuase as a surgeon u cannot just drop the scapel and go to kids school.  as for the in laws what a thing for them to say u dont deserve their daughter and on top of it its really none of their business.  lucky u got a driver and nanny that was able to help in that situation.", "NTA. Your children were not hurt. There were no police involved. You're not wrong.", "NTA: I see you are a neurosurgeon. Imagine the people trying to get surgery greatful that you stayed behind for something important. Its a very big job and your kids werent in danger. As long as your driver is trusted and you tried to do everything else in your power to figure out a way to pick them up without it interfering with work then i say goodjob. In this line i imagine you have to be a workaholic, Ive never had surgery but i appreciate your work. No harm came to the kids and you even got a nanny.

You did go there tho, just later in the day. You know, when you were *available.* \n\nYour wife married you knowing your job, and it's not like a job you can just skip out on. It seems you handled this *very* responsibly, I'm not sure why anyone would be upset with you. NTA.", "Can't really judge when you don't provide enough info. Why couldn't you leave work?
