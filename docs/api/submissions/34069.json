At the same time you're 17 and working with a brain that's not fully developed.

If someone told me to apologize to a slug like your uncle, I'd tell both of them to kiss my ass.", "YTA for doing this the day her mom died and while she is grieving. Also, your issues aren't just with your grandma, but your uncle. Why did you explode at her, not him? \n\nMeanwhile, clearly your uncle is unhealthy and his relationship with your grandma is toxic. You can distance yourself from that without making her day of grieving worse.", "ESH. Your grandmother and uncle might have a toxic relationship, but in my opinion, you have no right to comment on their relationship. They\u2019re content as they are. Your grandmother has no right to demand an apology from anyone. Forced apologies are worthless, in my opinion. \n\nIf I were going to apologize to anyone, if I were in your position, I would apologize to your mother, who lost her grandmother and might have her own feeling about the way her brother treats her mother. I might also apologize to your grandmother, because she lost her mother, and she might be treating your uncle this way to prevent him from killing himself with his drug abuse.", "Oof he's gonna be in big trouble when she dies, this is so sad for your family. Nta.", "YTA. Your grandmother's mother died and you're throwing a tantrum about food.\n\nYou will never be as important to your grandmother as your uncle is, because he is her child. Deal.

Maybe there is a time and place, but you just lost someone, too.  Toxic family members need to be called out.  I\u2019m so sorry for your mom.

Many things. \n\n\nLook you\u2019re not wrong, but it also isn\u2019t your problem, and that wasn\u2019t the time. I understand how it was the last straw. I do think you owe your mom an apology. This can\u2019t be easy for her on\u2026several levels. I would check in with her and see what she needs right now.

Screw that,  I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI would absolutely check in with your mother before making any decisions about that and try to mitigate the impact on her if you can. \n\nYour uncle is an AH, and your grandmother is \u2026. well the nicest way to say it is \u201cnot quite right in the head\u201d \n\nStaying out of it is probably the safest bet, but for sure talk to your mom.", "You've asked two questions - 1) Are you the asshole for yelling at her the day her mom died?

Your grandmother should be ashamed for being *f-ing sick* enough to refer to your uncle as her \u201conly baby left\u201d in front of your mom, *her still very much alive daughter*. I don\u2019t give a shit if her own mother just died. It\u2019s nearly 2024. We as a society need to stop coddling people who actively hurt others without good reason (in this case your grandmother is hurting everyone in her family with her words, actions, and behavior, *including your uncle*, he should not feel this entitled to be waited on hand and foot by anyone at his age).\n\n**A horrible situation does not grant anyone the right to be hurtful or toxic to those who have been helping them.**\n\n**A horrible situation does not grant anyone the ability to get away with being horrible to others.**\n\n**Grandma was hurtful and rude (and has obviously been for quite some time!), and *does not get a free pass* just because her mom died.**\n\nFfs she left caring for her dying mother in the hands of others to continue to cater to her fully functioning **adult** son because she has *trained him* to be incapable of being independent (and excused him physically abusing his ex??? Holy shit that is inexcusable wtf). She has failed him (and she will continue to fail him). She failed your mom (she parentified her and has shown blatant disregard for your mom\u2019s emotions to this day). She failed all her children by showing blatant favoritism towards your uncle. She failed her own dying mother, **WHICH IS F-ING SICK** in favor of her \u201cprecious baby\u201d. She has failed you, and all her other grandchildren by forcing you all to witness her clear favoritism towards your uncle, and showing you all that abusers should be coddled instead of shamed. She has failed all of you time and time again. She will continue to do so.\n\nAll this being said, your grandmother coddling your uncle this much after he physically abused his ex rings every alarm bell in my head. Does she actually believe that what he did wasn\u2019t wrong, or is she grateful to no longer have an empty nest and is willing to do whatever it takes to keep him from leaving? Is your uncle hurting your grandmother in order to keep being catered to? Is he emotionally abusing her by threatening to leave/hurt himself/not talk to her if she doesn\u2019t continue to cater to him? Is he going to start physically abusing her if she doesn\u2019t do what he wants when he wants it? Whatever the case may be, their relationship as parent and adult child is massively unhealthy. Their relationship hurts everyone, including them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if any of her children are going to help her when her health eventually fails (I mean your uncle clearly won\u2019t but I don\u2019t know about her other children), but I do know that your uncle is in for an extremely rude awakening when she can no longer cater to him and he finds himself with no one willing to do what she was doing for him.", "OP\u2019s MOM IS HER KID", "OP is not."]}
