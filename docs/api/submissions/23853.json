Your friend is being gross, and frankly kind of antisemitic to jump to the conclusion that your personal life is being oppressed by your religion. Furthermore, due to her financial problems, there's a chance she is fishing to see if she can come between you and your partner for some imagined financial benefit for her.\n\nHonestly, asking her to leave is the best move here.", "NTA.

She's not aware you're asexual, and asexuality is still something a lot of people don't really know about or understand. \n\nObviously your sex life is your private business, so it would be rude of her to try and push the point further.

I am a really private person, so I think even one question is too many, but I can see an argument that she is asking out of concern for you. But twice is absolutely too much.

I was going to say not ta but then you mentioned that she was a victim of Christian purity culture, and now her concerns makes way more sense.

So I'm sticking with NAH.", "She asks you intrusive questions about your relationship and sex life and you tell her that you don't want to talk about it and you're the one being rude. That's a bit rich. I think that you were perfectly reasonable and the epitome of restraint. If someone kept pressing me on the subject after I'd told them that I didn't want to talk about it, they'd have been told in no uncertain terms to mind their own effing business. NTA.", "NTA. She was extremely rude and condescending. You are right, it's none of her business how you and your partner express love for one another and whether sex has any part in it. And even if you were orthodox and waiting until marriage, what business of hers is it?", "NTA let her know it's none of her business and if she can't respect your boundaries then she can find somewhere else to stay", "You're not an asshole. You might've seemed a bit rude in the way you phrased how much you don't want to share about yourself with someone who you consider a friend, but you're still within your right to not talk about your sex life. \nThat being said, and I'm saying that to support you: If i were you, I'd just tell my friends I'm asexual. It's definitely one of the LGBTQIA+ community identities, true, but it's probably in the top 5 easiest identities to come out as. Asexuals face very mild judgement, mainly from complete idiots. If she's your friend, or even if she's just a random person that's not a huge ass - she won't judge you for it. She'll probably end up loving you more because you'll be sharing another facet of your life that she didn't know about you.", "NTA Even IF there was something wrong with your sex life, (I know. Theres not) you have made it abundantly clear that it is none of her business so the topic should be off the table for discussion.

Your sex life - or no-sex life - is similarly nobody's business. She may be a friend, but I think you're giving her too much leeway in terms of what sorts of rude, prying questions she's allowed to ask after she's already been told it's none of her business. If she'd been staying in my house, the second time I had to have that conversation with her would have come with a warning that the third time she raised the issue would be followed by her packing her bags.", "NTA but OP, for those who are not Authistic nor Asexual, it is a REALLY weird couple dynamic to observe, so her curiosity is actually natural.\n\nThere is one thing you could tell her that will make her stop, and that is to simply explain the truth: that you're both asexuals. Then she can understand and sate her curiosity.\n\nBut of course, you do not own her this explanation, and I understand you wainting to keep it a secret, but it would make your life easier.", "NTA but it's kind of weird that you're jumping through so many hoops when there's a simple solution by telling her yall are a-sexual lol \n\nEspecially because you're obviously close friends, I mean you're letting her live with you lol", "NTA, umm idk abt you but she has gotta go. sex life questions is...NOT OKAY! she might be a friend but she has stepped way too far, if she doesnt stop u can kick her out, i know i might be going too far, but this seems like a big red flag, she is poking into ur personal life and making u seem like a jerk bcs u wanna keep ur personal life personal, and she is still doing it", "NTA.  I cannot fathom inquiring about the sex life of one of my friends unless a) they brought it up and wanted input; or b) I was pretty sure something bad/abusive was going on.  Other than that whatever two consenting adults do (or don't do) is absolutely none of anyone else's business.\n\nIf she brings it up again, I would simply say \"Olivia, I'm really not the type of person who likes to discuss my interpersonal life with my partner so I'm going to ask that we don't bring this up again.

It was also none of her business, to be fair.", "NTA, tell her that you appreciate her concern, but once you said you didn't want to talk about it, it went from a kind expression of friendship to prying, that you don't want to talk about it, and that if she continues to bring it up after you've told her this is personal, it goes from kind to unkind and unwelcome.", "NAH. It wasn't really an appropriate thing to ask, but I think she did so out of genuine concern for you. She meant well, even if she went about it wrong. She probably thought about whether to ask you for a long time before she actually did, since thats not a conversation or topic to be taken lightly, but considering her past, ultimately decided that it was worth the discomfort and risk of upsetting you. (At least that's what I'd do.)\n\nYou don't have to out yourself to anyone, nor do you have to talk to anyone about your sex life.

But, with that said, she was too pushy when you repeatedly asked her to stop. However, it seems she was genuinely concerned for your wellbeing, rather than looking for you to justify your sexuality or provide salacious details. \n\nHowever - it's amazing how invested other people are in the sex and love lives of asexual people.

Tell her to mind her own business.", "For people who do have sex, it's kind of an important part of their relationship, and so it's normal for close friends/roommates to share concerns/funny stories relating to sex. It's okay that you don't care about sex, and you're under no obligation to divulge anything about your personal life to anyone, but hopefully you can understand that your friend was just showing curiousity/concern for the well-being of your relationship. Not necessarily judging or snooping. It's pretty normal conversation for close friends/cohabitants.", "Def NTA. No matter what the topic is, if someone says they don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore, then questions need to end. \nIt feels like she is masking her nosiness by saying she\u2019s \u201cconcerned.\u201d\nTime to tell her that she is making you feel uncomfortable in your own home and that she needs to find another place to crash!", "NTA.  She was being inappropriately nosy and persisted with her questions even after you told her you didn't want to discuss it.", "NTA. You had already told her once that it was none of her business. It should have been the end of the story right there. It's none of her business how you guys conduct your relationship.", "Soft YTA. They aren't weird questions. You're in a religion, and in what appears to others as a very cold relationship- friends worry about their friends and want to make sure they're being treated right and getting the love and affection they deserve. Lots of people in toxic situations say they don't want to talk about it when they really should be talking to someone about it.", "Definitely NTA. It was definitely  none of her business. She should have got that the 1st time you said it.", "NTA. \n\nSex life is a very private matter and you should not discuss it with your friends or literally anyone except your partner if you don't want to or aren't comfortable doing that. To be honest, I personally find it inappropriate to discuss your sex life with ANYONE else than your partner but I understand that different people have different views on this. Having said that, nobody can force you to talk about it if you don't want to. \n\nYour friend should learn some boundaries and understand that there are things which are none of her business.", "NTA - first off it\u2019s absolutely none of her business.  secondly, even IF y\u2019all were fucking everyday, having a houseguest puts a damper on things.  How does she not realize that?", "You're not even remotely an asshole. The fact that you have politely dismissed her *and then she still asked again* is ridiculous. She needs to get it through her thick skull that it's none of her damned business. You don't need to do anything. \n\nBut if she brings it up again, kick her out.", "NTA \n\nIt is really none of her business.\n\nIn this case, I would lie to her.

You shouldn't be questioned about your sex life, especially in your home!", "I understand how that would make you -and most people- uncomfortable. I think she is nosy but also wants to make sure you\u2019re happy. If you want her to leave you alone, I would try going another route: tell her you\u2019re very happy with your partner and would tell her if anything was up. Also add that it seems like she\u2019s judging your relationship and that\u2019s what\u2019s making you defensive. You are letting her into your home to help, but that is not an invitation to scrutinize your relationship.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your friend is being invasive.", "NTA. She has to find her own place. \n\nThe audacity. I can\u2019t imagine a situation where it is ok to call a friend rude because they don\u2019t want to talk about their sexe life.", "NTA, OP your friend is not some teenage girl who needs to know everything about your relationship. School girls usually share everything because everything is new and they like to share experiences. But as we reach adulthood we like to keep things private. Like you said it's non of her business she should back off. And I personally feel there should not be any obligation to tell our friends about our orientation. \n\nFew years back I thought I was demisexual currently I am asexual. Everything is fluid and our feelings and needs change with time and maturity. My friend made fun of me for changing my orientation. Whereas I was still trying to figure out my emotions. Similarly my best friend thought he was asexual but he is gay. So that doesn't mean he was lying to everyone. If you will tell your friend about your orientation chances are she might not understand it completely. This is a very delicate topic which should be discussed with only partners and seeing if we are compatible or not.", "NAH. I don't blame you for the reaction but consider that her reason for asking twice is from a place of concern. If y I ur relationship appears to her to be so far from her expectations of a healthy relationship she could have legitimate concerns for your overall well-being. Many of us have seen people accept a situation that is not what they truly want because culture, upbringing, religion, trauma, or anxiety tell us that is all we deserve. A good friend would want to make sure you are getting all we deserve in life. \n\nAsk her why she asked, where it is coming from, and tell her you appreciate the concern if it's coming from a place off love.", "NTA - Olivia wouldn't be either if she had just left it alone.  There's no reason you should feel obligated to share what happens or doesn't happen in your bedroom.  Bringing it up a second time was rude.", "NTA. You told her multiple times that it isn't her business, which it's not. The fact that she is so invested in knowing about your sex life is actually weird.", "[removed]", "NTA. The rules are simple: if someone does not want to talk about something, one should not bring it up again. And she broke that. Also I'm kind of wondering if she has some kind of attraction towards your partner? it is as if she's asking because she wants to make sure if she has a chance.", "NTA. That's terribly rude on her part. The first question was intrusive because it's none of her business but could be excused as concern. The second time was bs. She's prying and needs to stop. It's none of her concern what you and your partner are doing so long as no one is being abused.\n\n (It just occurred to me that your friend may besecond-guessingg her on past decisions. You said that she had experienced \"purity culture.\" She may be doubting her own decisions to have sex because some of her justification was probably \"everyone's doing it\" and you guys aren't. She should probably talk to someone if that's the case.)", "time for her to move out", "NTA. She said YOU were being rude? That\u2019s rich! You answered her question even though it was nosy. Asking for details after you shut down her questions the first time shows you needed to be blunt with her. It\u2019s none of her business. You were polite and respectful in the face of her intrusive questions. \n\nBeing invited into another person\u2019s home is sacred, in my opinion. It\u2019s wrong to use the information you learn against that person. Her questions were gossipy. I don\u2019t know if she would betray your confidence, but when someone doesn\u2019t tell you something willingly, don\u2019t ask!", "NTA, your sex life isn't her business.\n\nAlthough, I'd talk to your partner about your friends prodding in case she decides to try talking to them about it.", "You are definitely NTA here.", "NTA, if you didn't bring it up it's not a topic for open discussion.  She needs to step the back up.", "NTA. You can have any boundary that makes you feel comfortable, especially regarding your sex life. Your friend overstepped.

She\u2019s only going to get worse", "Since she is living with you why don't share to her about you being assexual?", "NTA - could you just not tell her that you and bf aren\u2019t comfortable being affectionate in front of others, maybe she takes a hint and Foxtrot Oscar out of your house", "NTA. You already told her it isn\u2019t her business, she needs to stop. You could calmly tell her again you are happy with your relationship and please stop. She is the one being rude at this point, but if you want to maintain the friendship, I\u2019d try one more time to be really clear with her.", "On a side note, being asexual is a result of chemical imbalance in the brain. I would go speak with a doctor about your health and your diet.", "I would say N A H had she dropped it after the first time you said it wasn\u2019t her business.

You'd think she'd be relieved to not witness the PDA or get woken up by weird sounds in the middle of the night.", "she\u2019s gonna try to sleep with your boyfriend lmao", "Ive got a friend who is the same way, is VERY open about her sexuality to the point where I'll \"go smoke\" when she and my wife are talking and it starts getting into details. I personally do not like it, its gross, not because of the content, because i just dont fucking care. I find it weird when she starts digging at our love life cuz it aint her shit. I for reals feel you on this. You go for a hike im all ears about it, you like a finger in your ass during coitus and im prolly not eating dinner at your house to hear about it. She thinks i really like her parents but i realized a decade ago if they are invited i dont hear about her weird shit.", "NTA. These are all incredibly inappropriate questions to ask. It's perfectly fine to get defensive when a persone is violating your boundaries, your friend should be apologizing for making you uncomfortable. Whatever arrangements two consenting adults have about PDA, sleeping conditions and other personal matters are not the matter of a houseguest's concern and don't require \"support\" or \"looking out for\". She's just being nosey and rude and should save the \"looking out for\" for herself and she seems to need it more than you do.", "NAH, sounds like a concerned friend, which you did describe her as a friend. Saying none of your business makes people feel bad, which is why she reacted the way she did. In the future, saying something like \"that's something I'm not comfortable discussing\" would be less confrontational. But I don't think either of did anything wrong.", "NTA, and you would be justified in saying \"hey, my sex life is *private* and I like it that way. Next time you think you're trying to help, stop and think if you want to stay here any longer, because you cannot continue to stay here while prying into that subject.\"", "NTA. It\u2019s really uncomfortable to bring up sex life like this, such a nosy behaviour. Sure her personal experience with a strict culture can somewhat explain how she would feel a bit concerned, but nothing justifies stepping all over the boundary you clearly set. For someone who cares so much, they should extend their supportiveness by quitting this awkward behaviour.", "That's what I'm thinking", "This.  \nWhen she is such a good friend she lives with you for some days/weeks why not tell her, that both of you are asexual and completely fine with not sharing in person affection but are both happy the way it is?  \nWhen she suffered in a purity culture she only seems to be concerned and looking out for you and is not realising it is a topic you are just happy with.", "The friend changed her story, she was never concerned about the religious stuff, she asked OP initially if they were pretending to have a relationship. You don't just throw an accusation like that out there. She also didn't drop it when OP made it clear that she didn't want to talk about it.", "Especially since op mentioned friend was a victim of a \"Christian\" cult. Friend is probably projecting because of her own trauma but is likely doing it out of concern.  Almost no one opens up about abuse or trauma the first time asked.  Friend probably thinks if OP is a victim similar to her it's going to take multiple conversations and showings of support before she'll open up", "I think it's rude to bring it up even the first time", "Noooooooo. Olivia has no right to continue to ask when told it\u2019s none of her business. I am sure it\u2019s easier to \u201cfix\u201d, or really fixate , on other people versus the fact that her life blew up so much she had to ask for a place to live. \n\nNTA and honestly the only people I would talk about my sex life with is my best friend, and then she wouldn\u2019t ask.", "Different people have different policies and boundaries on who can stay in their house.

It's natural to be curious or to check in but its about doing it tastefully which this girl isn't doing and its time for her to mind her own business and be thankgul for the living space.", "Absolutely NONE! She\u2019s NTA! And was a lot nicer than most.", "There is a N A H vote for this", "Friend has no idea if they are physically intimate or not, all she knows is they aren't intimate in front of her. That could easily be personal preference.\n\nPlenty of couples are all over each other and also shit shows. There is not correlation between how much sex people are having and how healthy the relationship is.\n\nThe definition of fake relationship is not two people who don't have sex, its people who are pretending to be in a relationship for appearances sake but don't actually consider themselves to be in a relationship. OP and their partner consider themselves partnered so there is nothing fake about it.\n\nSometimes when people get \\*defensive\\* it's because you're being \\*offensive\\*, as in this case. Assuming its their problem and not asking yourself if you might have overstepped a boundary seems bizarre to me, especially in this case where OP is explicit that the problem is that friend overstepped a boundary.\n\nIts none of her business because OP already said they didn't want to talk about it. Friend was not wrong for asking once, but friend was absolutely wrong for not taking no for an answer.", "100000000000% agree. I can see my best friend raising concerns in this exact same situation & I couldn\u2019t imagine getting mad at her for her concern.", "I have known folks who grew up in a \"Christian purity\" environment, and for some people it can really leave them messed up. It sounds like the friend thinks she is trying to help, but from the outside she is clearly overstepping boundaries especially after being explicitly told to back off. I would certainly be defensive in this situation and would strongly dislike the way the friend is broaching a personal subject after being told to back off. Given her background and experience, though, I would try to be understanding despite having the same reaction as the op, this may be an opportunity to help the friend with her baggage.", "That's a very allosexual point of view, just saying.", "Maybe bringing it up once with a \"hey is everything between you two good?  You happy?\" and leave it at that.  The deep dive and the repeated inquiry is NOT cool.", "How on earth are those not weird? The only person who could ask such things of a person is a therapist if the OP or her partner came to them with concern about their relationship.
