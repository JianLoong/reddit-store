Your friend is being gross, and frankly kind of antisemitic to jump to the conclusion that your personal life is being oppressed by your religion. Furthermore, due to her financial problems, there's a chance she is fishing to see if she can come between you and your partner for some imagined financial benefit for her.\n\nHonestly, asking her to leave is the best move here.", "NTA.

As a demi, it can get really annoying how many people feel that's it's okay to argue about your sex life when you identify as ace, even if they would never dream of doing it with a person/couple that was sexually active.

She's not aware you're asexual, and asexuality is still something a lot of people don't really know about or understand. \n\nObviously your sex life is your private business, so it would be rude of her to try and push the point further.

I am a really private person, so I think even one question is too many, but I can see an argument that she is asking out of concern for you. But twice is absolutely too much.

I was going to say not ta but then you mentioned that she was a victim of Christian purity culture, and now her concerns makes way more sense. Your sex life is definitely not her business, and she should have dropped it. But I can also see why she was concerned, not knowing that you and your partner are ace. So I'm sticking with NAH.", "She asks you intrusive questions about your relationship and sex life and you tell her that you don't want to talk about it and you're the one being rude. That's a bit rich. I think that you were perfectly reasonable and the epitome of restraint. If someone kept pressing me on the subject after I'd told them that I didn't want to talk about it, they'd have been told in no uncertain terms to mind their own effing business. NTA.", "NTA. She was extremely rude and condescending. You are right, it's none of her business how you and your partner express love for one another and whether sex has any part in it. And even if you were orthodox and waiting until marriage, what business of hers is it?", "NTA let her know it's none of her business and if she can't respect your boundaries then she can find somewhere else to stay", "You're not an asshole. You might've seemed a bit rude in the way you phrased how much you don't want to share about yourself with someone who you consider a friend, but you're still within your right to not talk about your sex life. \nThat being said, and I'm saying that to support you: If i were you, I'd just tell my friends I'm asexual. It's definitely one of the LGBTQIA+ community identities, true, but it's probably in the top 5 easiest identities to come out as. Asexuals face very mild judgement, mainly from complete idiots. If she's your friend, or even if she's just a random person that's not a huge ass - she won't judge you for it. She'll probably end up loving you more because you'll be sharing another facet of your life that she didn't know about you.", "NTA Even IF there was something wrong with your sex life, (I know. Theres not) you have made it abundantly clear that it is none of her business so the topic should be off the table for discussion. She is TA for persisting.", "Nta you get to say no, it doesn\u2019t matter what her intentions are. Stop trying to help her figure it out. It\u2019s not for her to get. Just say me and partner are happy I am not answering other questions and then don\u2019t anger", "NTA.\n\nYour sexual orientation is nobody's business unless you choose to share it with them. Your sex life - or no-sex life - is similarly nobody's business. She may be a friend, but I think you're giving her too much leeway in terms of what sorts of rude, prying questions she's allowed to ask after she's already been told it's none of her business. If she'd been staying in my house, the second time I had to have that conversation with her would have come with a warning that the third time she raised the issue would be followed by her packing her bags.", "NTA but OP, for those who are not Authistic nor Asexual, it is a REALLY weird couple dynamic to observe, so her curiosity is actually natural.\n\nThere is one thing you could tell her that will make her stop, and that is to simply explain the truth: that you're both asexuals. Then she can understand and sate her curiosity.\n\nBut of course, you do not own her this explanation, and I understand you wainting to keep it a secret, but it would make your life easier.", "NTA but it's kind of weird that you're jumping through so many hoops when there's a simple solution by telling her yall are a-sexual lol \n\nEspecially because you're obviously close friends, I mean you're letting her live with you lol", "NTA, umm idk abt you but she has gotta go. sex life questions is...NOT OKAY! she might be a friend but she has stepped way too far, if she doesnt stop u can kick her out, i know i might be going too far, but this seems like a big red flag, she is poking into ur personal life and making u seem like a jerk bcs u wanna keep ur personal life personal, and she is still doing it", "NTA.  I cannot fathom inquiring about the sex life of one of my friends unless a) they brought it up and wanted input; or b) I was pretty sure something bad/abusive was going on.  Other than that whatever two consenting adults do (or don't do) is absolutely none of anyone else's business.\n\nIf she brings it up again, I would simply say \"Olivia, I'm really not the type of person who likes to discuss my interpersonal life with my partner so I'm going to ask that we don't bring this up again.

It was also none of her business, to be fair.", "NTA, tell her that you appreciate her concern, but once you said you didn't want to talk about it, it went from a kind expression of friendship to prying, that you don't want to talk about it, and that if she continues to bring it up after you've told her this is personal, it goes from kind to unkind and unwelcome.", "NAH. It wasn't really an appropriate thing to ask, but I think she did so out of genuine concern for you. She meant well, even if she went about it wrong. She probably thought about whether to ask you for a long time before she actually did, since thats not a conversation or topic to be taken lightly, but considering her past, ultimately decided that it was worth the discomfort and risk of upsetting you. (At least that's what I'd do.)\n\nYou don't have to out yourself to anyone, nor do you have to talk to anyone about your sex life.

But, with that said, she was too pushy when you repeatedly asked her to stop. However, it seems she was genuinely concerned for your wellbeing, rather than looking for you to justify your sexuality or provide salacious details. \n\nHowever - it's amazing how invested other people are in the sex and love lives of asexual people.

I was going to say the opposite because it would be normal to be concerned as a friend.  To most this would be confusing and look like a room mates instead of a couple situation.

Doubly so for someone who is living in your home as a favour to her.\n\nShe is the one in the wrong here.", "NTA. When you ask intimate questions even if it is out of legitimate concern you need to be prepared to be told to mind your business. She shouldn\u2019t be offended by that.", "Rude? Rude is repeatedly asking someone personal intrusive questions about something that is none of their business. Hostile and clueless is THEM accusing YOU of being rude when you refuse to confide in them. NTA.", "Ugh, this one is hard for me. I\u2019m going to go with a very, very, very soft YTA because I think you are both miscommunicating in turn. \n\nI also have some experience with the dark side of purity culture, so I think this is why I have this perspective. \n\nShe is being way too pushy. This is obviously very uncomfortable for you, with good reason! However, there are some potentially harmful situations you could be in, so I can see how her concern can come from a place of fear for you. \n\nFor one, you could have a closeted sexual orientation and you\u2019re using your current partner as a \u2018beard\u2019. As your friend, I would want you to know you can be yourself with me, and don\u2019t have to pretend for me. This isn\u2019t too far off what is actually happening here; sadly most non-LGBTQ folks don\u2019t think of asexual people much, so your friend probably isn\u2019t thinking of this as your ideal relationship pattern. \n\nFor two, many people feel sex is a fundamentally important thing to themselves as part of their personal identity, and as a metric of how much they love their partner. She doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re ace, and doesn\u2019t think of ace as a possibility, so she\u2019s trying to empathize by putting herself in your shoes. She\u2019s imagining why she would get into such a relationship and how she would feel in it, and she keeps coming back with negative things. She can\u2019t understand it, so she asked you, and you gave her something she interpreted as anger (because you were likely a bit irritated by the question). Anger is often used to cover hurt, so she\u2019s afraid you\u2019re hiding something that\u2019s hurt you. This probably sounds like a reach for you, but this is textbook abusive relationship. Quick denials with no other explanation and shutting down further attempts to discuss is a big warning sign for abuse. If she\u2019s ever been around that, she might interpret it as such.\n\nEspecially since you call out the religious trauma, I really think this was her concern. I think she\u2019s being so pushy because she\u2019s afraid that you\u2019re being really hurt, and she\u2019d rather offend you than risk leaving you in abuse. That\u2019s a good friend. Of course, you know you\u2019re fine and feel she\u2019s just not hearing you, so I can understand the acute frustration.\n\nSo I suppose, to answer your question \u201cit\u2019s a weird thing to ask, right?\u201d - I think no, it\u2019s actually a very expected thing to ask when you find your friend is in a relationship that doesn\u2019t look like others that you\u2019ve seen, especially when it looks a little like some very very abusive ones you\u2019ve seen (I\u2019m guessing some arranged purity marriages). I had a polyamorous friend in college and I probably looked just as naive and shocked when I first visited her house and discovered not one but two boyfriends. I asked because I was close enough and felt comfortable enough with her to assume that she would know I wasn\u2019t asking with malice. She was comfortable talking about polyamory, though, whereas you\u2019re not ready to talk about asexuality (and you shouldn\u2019t need to).\n\nI would try to give your friend some grace here, and at the same time clarify your boundaries. She needs to understand and listen to you when you assure her there\u2019s no issue and you\u2019re very happy, and you shouldn\u2019t have to come out to her to do so. \n\nI would let this lie for a bit, and if she brings it up again, stop her and ask her to please take a moment and really listen to you. Tell her this is exactly how you want your relationship and you\u2019re really happy, and while you understand she\u2019s concerned for you, her concern is making you really uncomfortable. You have your reasons for appreciating this dynamic and you don\u2019t want to talk about them right now; maybe later you\u2019ll feel more comfortable but you\u2019re not at that point. You\u2019d appreciate it if she could let this go and stand by you and trust you as your friend.", "NTA.\nAltough I can understand where she's coming from having grown up ind some kind of christian purity cult and wanting to make sure you're not stuck in some weird religious community that forces stuff it really isn't ok how she did it. I get it, victims ob abuse, no matter if physical, emotional, mental or spiritual/religious don't like talking about it and other than questioning others about their sex life is just rude, if you doo too much pushing the victim will close themselves instead of opening up.

Especially since your friend doesn't know you're ace from hes perspective she kinda has to think something is off because the fewest allos even think about an ace community existing if nobody close to them is an ace and/or are not informed about the LGBTQIA+ community, although a big part of them also don't accept asexuality as a part of tgeir community for whatever reason as I've heard.\nThis is in no way an excuse for her inacceptable behaviour but it might be an explaination why she questioned you further.

Doesn't make it true it's just what some people would draw a conclusion towards.\n\nMaybe I'll get killed for this but is there a reason why you don't want to tell her you're asexual? I know some people who are asexual and they told me relatively early in our friendship so I never really thought about that being something people don't like to talk about.

But reiterate that both you and your partner have your personal reasons for not really \"acting\" like a conventional couple, and that you just simply are not comfortable discussing the fine details of your sex life with ANYONE - not just her - and would appreciate if she respected that boundary. Maybe even highlight that it's not just a boundary YOU have set in regards to privacy, but your partner- who doesn't know her as well and has every right to not have to explain their sex life to a relative stranger - as well. Ask if she would like it very much if someone she didn't know very well started wanting to know details about her sex life or some other very personal topic just because they were friends with her partner.

In my experience, the repression and obsession are two sides of the same coin; sexual people without issues have a healthy appreciation, but it ebbs and flows naturally over time, and a time of change and adjustment (like getting a friend set up in your house) might be an ebb because things are busier and there's other stuff to think about.", "I think that's to far.

She had already been told very clearly it was none of her business. Yet she brought it up again and accused OP of being defensive and snappy. Well, yeah, because roommate inserted herself into something that was none of her business, and here she goes doing it again. When you\u2019re told to stay in your lane and you refuse to stay in your lane, you are, in fact, the asshole. The roommate is snooping at this point.

My friend group is made of mainly couples, jokes are occasionally made, and PDA does occur... But bedroom stuff is brought up by the involved couple, or not at all. Maybe our group is weird by that metric, or maybe it's a cultural thing. If even one of my close friends pushed for this kind of talk after being told no, I'd be uncomfortable, too.\n\nEither way, it sounds like OP's friend did NOT come from a healthy culture of discussion OR boundaries, so while I can't blame her from being concerned for OP, I feel like she needs to learn when to back off. First time was a hint, second time should have made it clear, doubling down is going too far. A life after escaping religious extremism tends to need therapy, anyway. \n\nNAH, but OP's friend needs to back off so that it stays that way.", "The roommate became the asshole when she brought it up a second time after being clearly told it wasn\u2019t her business.

If people are letting you stay in their apartment in no way their sexual life is \"key information\". Key information is what their schedule is like in general and how she can contribute to the household so she's not too much of a burden on them. Unless she's witnessing something that looks like domestic abuse or other harmful/illegal activity she's not entitled to an explanation, people can live as \"weirdly\" as they want in their own home.\n\nAs a person who's not asexual but wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship for a long time and got asked a lot of intrusive questions I still find it annoying that asexual or aromantic people are expected to explain their personal matters just because their life doesn't align with other people's assumptions. It's a burden and it's annoying and people should know how to mind their own business.", "I disagree. Her friend was in the wrong to keep pushing when she herself admitted that it seemed to make OP upset the last time she brought this up.

She might be curious but there a thing called \"manners\" and usually not asking, especially repeatedly, about personal finances, sex life or health conditions is a part of it.

If the friend is close enough to be allowed to move in, why not squash the worry with a simple, \"we're both ace, and please don't speak to anyone else about this.\". \n\nBecause as it stands, the friend will likely try and help what they see as a failing relationship.

Where was the malicious intent there? Honestly I would ask the same questions in that position, not to be nosy but to genuinely make sure my friend isn\u2019t dealing with something. What is so taboo about that? This is the same as asking how much someone earns/a job pays or asking someone their age.

OP appreciates/loves that her friend is concerned for her well-being, but she is satisfied with the amount of affection and support she gets out of her partner.  \n\nIt can come across as patronizing to someone who didn't grow up in a toxic culture because it's the same kind of conversation you'd have with a child learning healthy sexual boundaries, but OP's friend never got that education.

Honestly, if someone doesn\u2019t bring up their relationship being in trouble it\u2019s best to stay out of it for reasons exactly like this (and general respect if a person\u2019s boundaries), but I can see why Olivia reached the conclusion she did.", "Also sleep separately and dont appear to have any type of physical/romantic relationship\n\n\nWhat op describes sounds on the outside like roommates more than a couple and the friend has no context because op isnt openly ace", "Yeah, I can see her persistence being unwelcome, but if she really considers OP her friend, her concern is not necessarily misplaced.", "Sleeping separately is gaining popularity, for a variety of reasons, and they're not *publicly* physical, to the roommate's knowledge. \n\nIt's still incredibly rude to accuse your friend of having a fake relationship after a week of not seeing them be physical.", "Yeah the friend has clearly went through trauma that she\u2019s hoping her friend isn\u2019t also experiencing. She\u2019s not wrong that extreme defensiveness is a sign of being in a bad situation. I think people are being way to hard on someone who probably means well. She has no idea op is asexual so seeing her friend not even sleep in the same room as her partner is probably concerning", "Hell, an ex and I (with a very amicable break up that had nothing to do with our sex life lol) were together for five years and never even moved in together. Folks teased that it was unheard of for lesbians, but we had our reasons and were perfectly happy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That made me laugh, thank you.", "Did you burn the house down!  I hear that teaches them a lesson!", "Or #doncheadle snl", "NTA. She's the one being rude. If she presses it, and you're trying to smooth things over, you could let her know you would be put off by anyone trying to insert themselves in your relationship, and prying into personal sex stuff.\n\nYou could also just blame her for being there. Even though it's not true, she might respect that you don't copulate when you have guests, and if she goes into, \"But I don't miiiiind!\" you'd be plenty justified at snapping at her and letting her know you and your partner DO mind.\n\nI understand why you don't wanna come out as ace. People can be so dumb and invasive about it.", "I\u2019d just be very explicit:\n\n\u201cI appreciate your concern but your comment that we have a fake relationship was very hurtful.\n\nIt may not look like your relationships, but we are very happy and we make it what we both want. \n\nI have no intention of having any further discussion about this and I expect that you\u2019ll respect that.\u201d", "You're close enough to her to let her live with you, but not close enough to come out to her about your asexuality? You know about her zedsexuality, right? If she's a real friend, knowing you're asexual will both create more closeness between you and set her mind at ease.\n\nNTA, but neither is she. She's trying to bond with you and be a good friend to you. If you don't want to grow closer to her, then you ought to let her know that a close friendship between you two is not in the cards for you.\n\nThe bonus of coming out is that once you do, if she continues to push the sex issue, *now* you know she's an asshole and that investing any time or effort into your friendship with her is a drain on your spoons.", "Right? and insunuating that OP doesn't \"appreciate her support,\" as if OP cant know what kind of support she needs.  \n\n\nThis is just the friend being nosy and framing it as help for OP.", "Why do I get the feeling the feeibd is only concerned because she's had an attraction to op or the boyfriend in the past but just settled for being friends with them.", "\"I noticed you didn't seem happy about discussing this topic. *LET'S DISCUSS IT FURTHER.*\"", "Her curiosity doesn't trump your privacy. I don't think she's so much concerned as she is nosy. NTA", "Same I read the title and was certain OP was having loud sex every night and bothering their friend but hilariously it is in fact the exact opposite of that", ">She's demoted herself from guest to \\*PEST\\*.\n\nLOVE this! you are 100% correct", "I think the friend needs to look for her own accommodation.\n\nIt is none of her business to know other's love life.\nGuess, she is considering to date OP's partner, than actually being concerned about OP.\n\nNTA.\n\nOP should keep her in her place or evict her if she doesn't know respect or boundaries.\nOr use Bugspray..", "Exactly. OP, next time she brings it up, just change the subject and say, \u201cSo! How\u2019s the apartment hunt going?\u201d \n\nIf she persists in talking about your sex life instead, then YOU insist on continuing to probe for details on the house hunt. \u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll be able to sign a lease? What date do you expect to be moving out? Shall we put it on the calendar now?\u201d\n\nShe should get the hint. And if nothing else it gives you some other things to say when she starts nitpicking your relationship.", "Imagine the friend having sleepless nights on thr couch for not hearing sex noices. She needs to find a new place to stay over.", "OP doesn't need to share whether there is an issue or not. Telling her there wasn't still didn't get the roommate off her back.", "Asking a second time would be even more offensive after being told it\u2019s not something that they want to discuss.", "Exactly man. Make her ass uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's directly from the tap... And by tap I mean hi..\"\n\n\"I GOT IT!!\"", "If she knows you're autistic, she may be trying to \"fix\" you. This doesn't go anywhere good. I'd ask her to make other living arrangements."]}
