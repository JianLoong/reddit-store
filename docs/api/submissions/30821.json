Your mother and all the family trying to excuse her behavior are the AH in this situation.\n\nAnd those were not \u201cjokes\u201d they were rude, hurtful comments.  I am sure no one laughed.\n\nMy opinion on abuse being justified as a \u201cjoke\u201d:\n\nThere is no joke. You are not \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d This is just abuse.\n\n\u201cJust joking\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t take a joke\u201d is a classic behavior of the bully. The bully does or says something abusive to you. You react negatively, call them out, say stop, or this is not funny. Bully says you can\u2019t take a joke, you are too sensitive, makes you out to be the bad guy even though their behavior was hurtful and abusive. Then the bully will play the victim, you can\u2019t take a joke and now the bully has hurt feelings, why are you so mean, don\u2019t abuse the jokester you awful person.\n\nThis is the typical dynamic of the \u201cjust joking\u201d routine. The bully gets to abuse you three times and make you the bad guy. They abuse you with the \u201cjoke\u201d, then they call you out for not liking the joke, being sensitive, then they play victim and accuse you of hurting them for not liking the \u201cjoke\u201d.\n\nAlways call out the bully to explain exactly why and how their joke was funny, or tell them you don\u2019t find their comments kind and want to understand exactly why they would say such an inappropriate thing. They won\u2019t be able to explain their actions rationally, they will only be able to make you out to the bad guy or have a lame excuse of trying to do you some kind of favor or \u201cwhat\u2019s best for you.\u201d You tell the bully \u201cnow that you know I am not interested in your comments you can stop making them.\u201d\n\nAlways tell the bully you will not tolerate them acting in this way again, that you expect an apology for their actions. And if no apology is forthcoming, if no changed behavior occurs, you put the bully on a time out. You leave their presence or ask them to leave your home. Always enact consequences when boundaries are not respected.", "NTA. Glad to see someone stand up to bad parents to defend their partner.", "NAT you specifcally asked her not to do that on the most important day of your lives and she did it anyway. even if it is a \"joke\" \\[ which i dont really see those as jokes \\] \n\njokes are suppossed to be funny and that however is not. that day was about you and your wife and she made it about herself by doing what you asked her not to do. seems to me like she may have some narssasistic traits just by making those so called \"jokes\".", "NTA \n\nEven if it was a joke(it wasn't). You asked her to stop because it's hurtful, and she didn't.\n\nFrom here on in just tell everyone that mentions it that if you're willing to boot your mom from your wedding over it, your willing to cut people out for it. \n\nPretty sure after things die down what people will remember is your boundary and willingness to stand up for your wife.\n\nAnd if you mom keeps her sh!t up, remind her that there will be other aspects of your lives she can be removers from also", "NTA but I caution you that \u201cjust jokes\u201d are usually used as a cover to express deeper feelings.
