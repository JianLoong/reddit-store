This thing has caused depression which I didn\u2019t even know I struggled with, I kind of assumed it was me being lazy and part of getting older.\n\nOnce I went on meds for my condition, my depression completely went away and I\u2019m back to my normal self, me from before it all started.

I also broke up with my ex because I realised I was putting up with a lot because I didn\u2019t see certain things.\n\nThis morning, a group of my friends came over in a staged intervention (they\u2019ve been making jabs at me for being geeky for a few weeks now and asking why I\u2019m doing this and not accepting \u201cbecause I enjoy it\u201d as an answer). They sat me down and proceeded to tell me how I\u2019m wasting my money on classes. There\u2019s no point in them, it\u2019s a waste of time and money. How I changed for the worst, how I broke up with my boyfriend (who I was supporting at the time because he wouldn\u2019t have a job). And so on and so forth.  Basically, anything I did that was as innocent as going swimming was picked apart and critiqued.\n\nI\u2019ve had enough and snapped, told them that it\u2019s none of their business what I\u2019m doing in my free time and to fuck off if they\u2019re going to critique everything I do and to stop defending my ex because they didn\u2019t know the half of it.\n\nThey were extremely angry and continued telling me how I changed and I wouldn\u2019t even go out with them tonight (I\u2019d much rather stay home and relax rather than go out).\n\nI kicked them out and they called me an asshole. \n\nThey\u2019ve been making snap stories all day about me and I\u2019m having my doubts about how I handled it.

So I\u2019m currently medicated for ADHD, have gone through two mental breakdowns (17 and 30) that came from two severe depressive episodes, and a 2 year battle with anxiety+panic attacks. I\u2019ve been through the ringer, so I want you to know I get it. \n\nThis shit is hard. Mental health journeys are difficult as is and are made manageable by the support system we have around us. Something happens as we do the hard work and take our meds and get our lives together: as we change, so do our friends. Their perceptions of us change because we no longer *need* them and since we don\u2019t need them, their value in our lives can become threatened. The space we used to hold for them is now being used to create more value for the things we enjoy again or have discovered. This can and has caused a lot of resentment because people feel left behind while you better yourself and chase new things. This is their stuff and their issues and it is NOT your job to work hard for other people\u2019s stuff. \n\nReal friends should encourage you to continue to chase the new sun in your life. They should be happy you\u2019re well and no longer in bad relationships - these people could not fathom a happy you and came as a group to tell you. Think of it like this: mental wellness is a boundary we draw that allows us to define happiness from self destructive tendencies. Your friends are not happy about that. Boundaries only upset those that previously benefitted from there being none. If they approach you again and you wanna broach the subject, I\u2019d ask them: \u201cWhy are you threatened by me being happy?\u201d Then, just listen to their answers. Are they angry? Are they needy? Did you turn into a rude person? But most importantly:\n\nDid you lose your utility?\n\nIt might not be that who you are has changed, but what you\u2019re willing to do with and for them has. If their statements are utility statements, drop these people, block, and enjoy your life. You do not need to hold on to people so entitled that they\u2019d discourage your health in exchange for your services. \n\nCongrats on your mental health and coming this far - it isn\u2019t easy.

As someone with a chronic illness myself and who has also battled depression and anxiety, along with a fun ADHD diagnoses in my 40\u2019s, I totally understand how this stuff can impact your energy level and how hobbies and interests can fall to the wayside unless/until you feel better. \n\nBut I honestly can\u2019t say that I have fundamentally changed as a person to the point that anyone would become concerned when I was *better*.
