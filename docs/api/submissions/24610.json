{"id": 24610, "submission_id": "15qpt8y", "title": "AITA for threatening to kick my step daughter out unless she apologises to my daughter?", "selftext": "I(40m) have a daughter \"Nina\"(12f). I also have a step daughter \"Kelly\"(16f) and me and my wife \"Anna\" have a child(6f) together. This is about Nina and Kelly.\n\nI have met my wife when Kelly was 5 and within a year she and Kelly moved in with me. The house we live in has been in my family for generations and passed on to me when I was really young. I have also made some renovations there. It is a 4 bedroom house with 4 bathrooms (one is downstairs and is a guest one, with 3 upstairs, one is shared between 2 rooms), so each girl has her own room and an ensuite, which is especially helpful with Kelly due to how long she now takes with her make up. \n\nThis has started about a month ago when Nina would come home crying due to bullying at her school. Me and Anna spend ages trying to get the school to do something and find out where the bullying comes from. It all came to a conclusion a week ago when we found out that it was Kelly who was spreading the rumours about Nina. I was furious and confronted her about it as some rumors were based on Nina not having a mum (she died during childbirth).\n\nKelly didn't take the confrontation very well. She accused me of favouring Nina (Nina has slightly bigger bedroom but smaller bathroom) and Kelly wanted more space. I said I am not going to move Nina out of her room after all these years and Kelly has already declined to swap with us as she doesn't want to share her bathroom with anyone, including our 6 years old. I have told Kelly that she must apologise to Nina as some of the things she said were vile and not deserved and told her she will be grounded as she still behaved like Nina's friend while spreading those rumours behind her back. Kelly threw a fit and claimed Nina is a threat to her and her reputation, but I stayed firm as I don't see how a 12yo can be a threat to a highschooler? As Kelly started saying more vile things about Nina and our 6yo, I have told her she has 48 hours to pick her belongings and I will be dropping her off at her dad's (she visits him every other week), where she will have to share a room and the bathroom with her other half siblings. Kelly and Anna are both annoyed at me over this and have called me an asshole. Anna said I have no right to parent Kelly, but she is in my home and her behaviour towards my daughters is not acceptable.\n\nEdit: I might have worded it wrong, by dropping her off I don't mean Kelly will be living at her dad's permanently. This is until she apologises to Nina for the things she said to her and about her, and to me and Anna over what was said about our 6yo, since some of it was unnecessary cruel and untrue.\n\nEdit: I know it is late, but here is a small update.\nI have spoken to Anna about what Kelly said about Nina and our 6yo and have also showed this post. Anna has apologised for brushing it off, she said Kelly didn't tell her most of the story and blamed others on the rumours and she haven't realised the extend of it. She will be having a conversation with Kelly and Kelly's dad tomorrow as this behaviour is not acceptable or appropriate. To put it lightly she is horrified of the comments made by her about both girls and finds it vile, she is also shocked that Kelly made them in the first place.\n\nNow to address some of the comments. Having Kelly to go and live with her father is a temporary solution and never intended to be permanent, especially if she changes her ways. It was more to separate her from Nina and 6yo to make sure no more damage is done while we are not watching. If roles were reversed and it was Nina who is at fault, I would have sent her to her grandparents to sort out the next move. I have seen a lot of suggestions about therapy, Anna said she will book it as soon as she has a chat with Kelly as she wants to know what caused a sudden change.\n\nI'm not cutting Kelly from my will, unless she carrys on displaying such anger towards her sisters. I'm not selling TS tickets either since it is something Kelly wanted to attend for years. However if there's no progress it will be my wife and her friend going to see TS.\n\nNina is having a few days off from school and I will be taking her out to the zoo and spending some father/daughter time together, I will also ask if she feels she wants therapy to talk things through. Me and Anna will also be taking our 6yo to see some cartoons this weekend and to her favourite cafe (Nina can come too, but she is usually busy at the riding school on the weekends).", "created_utc": 1692005413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qpt8y/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_my_step_daughter_out/", "score": 7449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Straightener her out now, bulling is not acceptable.", "That's what I'm wondering", "Why would it get better when they're older?\n\nNina is growing up feeling that her older sister is a bully who hates her and attempts to hurt her in terrible ways that are hard to fix.  Nina is objectively correct.  That does not lead to it being better when they're older; it leads to your other daughters being permanently hurt and wanting nothing to do with Kelly as an adult.\n\nIf Anna wants it to get better once they are older, she needs to teach Kelly to _behave_ better now.  If she refuses to let you discipline Kelly then she should have done it herself, and done it so thoroughly that Kelly would never behave like this again.  She can't have it both ways; if you're not Kelly's parent and can't discipline her, then Kelly's welfare is not your responsibility.  And Nina's absolutely is.  You shouldn't be making your children live with a bully who is trying to hurt them.\n\nThis kind of bullying can hurt Nina's schooling, on a long term basis.  It causes trauma that hurts academic results and social integration.  This is serious, it's not like two children fighting over a toy.\n\nSo no, you shouldn't back down; you should be angry with Anna for refusing to discipline her child, leaving you with no other way to protect yours.  The ideal answer is for you both to treat all three as your children and teach them to live together as sisters... but Anna is actively sabotaging that; you can't treat them equally if one is immune to discipline and two are not.\n\nKelly is only a couple of years from being an adult.  When she's living with other people this kind of toxic behaviour will not magically be excused.

Mom also tried to find out who was behind the rumors as OP said.

From all of the information you gathered from OP, it\u2019s still not enough for you to conclude that mom didn\u2019t try to at least tell her daughter to leave the little girl alone.

I could be wrong, but OP seems very much in denial about his role in this, also if he cares so much about Nina\u2019s well being, then shouldn\u2019t he put his ego aside and try to make things work with Kelly for his own daughter\u2019s sake?", "I\u2019m saying a 16 year old\u2019s irritation with her younger siblings is normal, but I definitely agree with you that getting others to bully your younger sibling isn\u2019t normal at all.

If she thinks that you have no right to parent HER child, after the two of you raised her since she was five then that's just wrong-headed thinking.  It also means that your wife and your step-daughter will gang up against you anytime they disagree with one of your parenting decisions.  You need to straighten that out right away.  As for the bullying, it seems like 'Kelly' could benefit from counseling as well as sensitivity training classes so that she can learn how her actions affect others.  Sure, it's not unreasonable for you to expect her to apologize to your other daughter but you can't force Kelly to do it, nor is it a good idea to threaten to kick her out if she doesn't.  That is going to drive a wedge not only between you and Kelly; Kelly and Nina but also between you and your wife.", "Bullying is a serious situation. I applaud you protecting your daughter. However, ideally, you would find a way to discipline your step-daughter without sending her away. To me that would be a last resort and really could damage your family dynamic. \n\nTo me, sounds like you need to have more conversations and more parenting happening. And also to work out with your wife that, yes, you are both allowed to be parents and must be parents for this blended family to work. \n\nWhat Kelly did is very wrong, it absolutely has to stop, she has to be set straight and learn empathy and compassion, and you have to work together to figure out how to make that happen.", "ESH - I'm not going to call you an asshole bc it's understandable where your emotions are coming from.

You two need to figure out what's going on, where it started, why and what's the appropriate consequence and plan of action. I would recommend the step dad should be involved. \n\nBeing in a blended family and navigating these boundaries are more difficult than you think.

I hardly can imagine it's ok to decide alone to kick your stepdaughter out of the house without a conversation with her mother/your wife.\n\nAlso \"she is in my home and her behaviour towards my daughters is not acceptable.\". She is in her home too, if she's living there.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the bullying thing is terrible and from your story this Kelly doesn't seem like a good sister or daughter, but this said, from your post I read that you consider her a guest at your house and you naturally care more about your biological and smaller daughter, but this can be a really hard environment for a teenager to live in too, especially if it's you who makes the rule in the house.\n\nHer issues probably also have roots there, and her jealousy towards Nina may  have some grounds. The bullying is terrible and you and your wife have to deal with this, I'm just saying you probably have to think of the family and house in a different way if you want everyone to get along together better in the future.

My reasoning to say maybe not jumping to kicking her out is that the step daughter would feel like she is trash that can and will be thrown away when you guys get mad or tired of her.  She is a minor. By kicking her out your giving her father enough ammunition to take her away from your wife, who may never forgive you.\n\nSo before going the nuclear route I would suggest alternate the punishment to the following:\n\n1- counseling for kelly and Nina separately, and then counseling for the family. I suggest this first due to the fact that blended families are tough. It will help both girls. It will help get to the bottom of why kelly is doing this. It will be help Nina to deal with the bulling she has endured. It will help you and your wife on how to navigate your family.\n\n2- kelly has to attend a bullying class and pass it.\n\n3- kelly has to be grounded from friends, electronics, etc until you and your wife feel like it\u2019s a sufficient amount of time. \n\n4- after the completion of the bullying class kelly has to apologize.\n\n\nI would make it clear that if you choose this route that these terms are not negotiable. All terms have to be meet. If one term is not meet then kelly has to live with her dad until they are. If your wife does not agree make sure she realizes that she is more than welcome to leave also but she will not be taking the 6 year old after the vile and disgusting things she let her daughter say about her. You will not allow her to be bullied.\n\nThis route if this marriage does not work out at least your wife can not say your where abusive and made your 16 year old homeless. You can honestly say that you tried to get her help. Your wife was the one that would not agree to get her the help she needed and you will have a stronger case to keep full custody of the 6 year old if it comes to a divorce and custody battle.\n\nI would also keep all documentation on Kelly\u2019s disturbing behavior. Your wives reaction to it, the horrible vile things she says about your daughters. This could also come in handy if this comes to a divorce and custody battle.\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I understand wanting to throw kelly out to live with dad. But I believe you may be shooting yourself in the foot long term. Some times  doing stuff in anger hurts us in the long run. I don\u2019t see mom never agreeing to let her come home even if it\u2019s weekend visits. I can see mom using this against you as you being abusive. And mom saying that kelly is a child and your abandoning her to get sympathy if it does come to a divorce.", "The real question is: why does Kelly do this?

This will lead to more friction between you and her and also your daughter and her, but I think that's better to handle her than send her away.\n\nYou should also tell her with no way to make it sound otherwise:  \n\"You ARE MY DAUGHTER and I LOVE YOU.

My guess is that\u2019s where the problem lies; that your step-daughter is struggling with feeling out of place in your household because she\u2019s coming in as a step-child. Using her father for the punishment reinforces that view. And if she views that she\u2019s an outsider and that your 12 and 6 year olds aren\u2019t really ~~your~~ her family, or that they are more loved than she is, she won\u2019t respect them and may well continue to bully them.\n\nYou and your wife need to have a conversation to create a plan for how to deal with this.

That means that you are in the 16-year old\u2019s life because her mother brought you into her life. And that means her mother needs to be there in lock-step with you in dealing with this in order to give it legitimacy. You should also have a conversation about getting therapy/counseling for your teenager.\n\nThen, you AND your wife need to have a conversation with your teenager and establish the following:\n\n1) She is a member of this household and is very much loved by both you and your wife, along with her sisters.\n\n2) It is unacceptable for family members to hurt each other the way that the 16-year old hurt the 12-year old.\n\n3) Reiterate that there are consequences for such behavior (EXCLUDING GOING TO FATHER\u2019S PLACE).

Maybe she feels neglected in some way. A 16 year old isn't equipped to always be able to tell you what is really going on. She is complaining about school, find out what is going on.

All parenting adults and Kelly should also be doing group therapy to find the source of the issue with a professional to guide a healthy discussion. Nina would also benefit from therapy too.   \n\n\nP.S.  OP, please look into leaving your homes in a trust with your guidelines. A will alone makes it dangerously vulnerable especially when there is already animosity.

In another incident, where the dad died and the eldest was appointed the executor of the will;  the eldest is now kicking out her sister and the sister's autistic child that the dad had living at the house. Trusts carry more legal weight ensuring one party cannot take action. You cannot guarantee your friend will be alive to be the executor or that the courts won't step in if the will is challenged. Greed is ugly.", "ESH. \n\nI agree Kelly should be punished. But no good parent uses \"kicking minor child out of house\" as a good punishment. Sorry, but there are other ways.

Obv. the bullying is wrong and there should be consequences.

Is it really an equally loving father daughter relationship or has there maybe been always a bit of resentment towards you since the start? I'm asking because I have a stepdad as well and though we moved in with him when I was 12, I've never grown to love him as much as I love my father and I still quite dislike him. Kelly has this right, too, even though you're providing for her equally. And if that is the case and she either feels like you are not willing to be a great father to her OR she does not want you to act like a father, then I also agree with Anna, that you have no right to parent her. \n\nAs for Anna you seriously need to sit down together and agree on how to proceed. I agree it's maybe not your job to parent her daughter but this puts you in an impossible position if she refuses to do anything. There is no way she cannot act on that. \n\nTwo more points: I'd strongly advise therapy as a family and also for Kelly alone.

It's no longer mean bullying but spreading lies that could quite literally ruin our lives. I can't begin to explain how I am terrified of my own sister.\n\nWhile I do think Kelly needs therapy I also think you and your wife need to actually chat with her as I suspect a lot of this bullying is due to resentment from her not understanding money. You clearly don't think her makeup is a hobby and I guarantee she knows that and resents you for it. She also (again, like my family) sees Nina has these expensive hobbies and I'm positive DOES NOT REALIZE how much money you spend on her. \n\nI was the horse riding, art school attending, random hobby kid in our family. My sister had the same opportunities but my parents didn't pressure her so she stopped when she wanted where as I only stopped if they had conflicting times with another hobby.

But I'm guessing something set this off and while she will definitely benefit from therapy, sending her to her dad's will just build resentment and not actually solve the real problem.

He's a great household logistics expert, at everything from doing the shopping and cooking to making certain anybody who's going on an airplane has up to the minute information about the status of their flight, the weather where they're landing, and the likelihood of turbulence on the way. And he's a great *friend* to my kids, taking them to do interesting things and talking to them for hours about stuff they like to talk about. But decisions about what they're allowed to do, and discipline, and discussions about their goals for their future and how to get them there, all fall under my purview.\n\nIn our family, he was the one who decided that he'd stay out of those categories, but I can easily imagine a family in which it was the birth parent who decided it was the right way to divide the duties and brought that up for discussion. Hopefully at that point, the other parent would see the point and be comfortable with it. \n\nBut none of that is about which is the blood parent and which the stepparent. In my kids' other household, discipline -- and most of the active parenting decisions in general -- are the province of their stepmother, because she's much better at all of it than my ex is, and all of us know it. My ex laughs and plays with the kids; takes them out to music festivals and berry picking and sledding hills; and works himself very hard at a difficult job in order to provide for them. But he doesn't discipline them; he never has.

I would also follow up with the school, she needs counseling and suspended for her behavior as most schools have a \"no bullying policy\"  Is seems you don't care that she is older than her step-sister and that she should get her way which is what her mom's been doing, it's called enabling the behavior.", "I guarantee if the roles were reversed your wife would have a lot more to say about it.", "exactly Anna seems to think her daughter isn't the mean girl and thinks the punishment was harsh.  what's happening is that she wants Nina to go to the grandparents so she can have the house to herself and hopes the 6 year old goes with her.  I'm sure some of mom's behavior is at play here.", "Please allow me to ramble a bit about my own family to give you some hope: I was just entering middle school when my dad remarried. (He had just gotten out of prison a couple years prior\u2014minimum security\u2014so I was still getting used to having my dad back.) I wasn\u2019t happy at all. I hated her. She was loud and unafraid to share her opinions on anything and everything. \n\nBut she looked me in the eye and told me \u201cI\u2019m not here to be a replacement mom for you. I don\u2019t make rules for you, but I will enforce rules that are for your safety. It\u2019s my job to be a *role model* to you, but it\u2019s up to you to decide if I am that or not.\u201d \n\nIt took me a few years to come around. (I only got to see my dad on weekends, and then when they moved away, only for a few weeks in the summer time.) but I can remember the exact moment. We were all getting ready to go somewhere and I just wanted 5 minutes to straighten my bangs. I had some real self esteem issues, and I hated my hair. I just wanted to straighten the bangs and wear the rest of it up. My dad didn\u2019t see the point, and she rolled her eyes and told me that nobody will care what my hair looks like. \n\nI snapped out \u201c*I* care!\u201d And she stopped and she looked at me and then she said \u201cokay. We\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d And afterwards she told me she\u2019ll always support me doing things to make *myself* look better for *me*. \n\nAnyways after I graduated high school she and my dad got a divorce. She told me \u201cI\u2019m not leaving *you*, I\u2019m leaving him. I still want to be in your life.\u201d And so she was/is. I\u2019ll be moving in with her later this year (I\u2019m 27 but rent prices are fucking stupid). She\u2019s more of a parent to me than either of my parents are. (NC with mom, LC with dad). \n\nBlended families work if the adults in the equation actually bother to communicate about roles and responsibilities. My stepmom accepted that she wasn\u2019t my parent, but she treated me with respect and my dad made sure that even if I didn\u2019t like her it was clear I had to listen to her on the things that mattered.", "I'll give you an injection of hope here then: my blended family is amazing. I still have a great relationship with my mom, she is the best woman I know - but I'll be damned if my stepmother isn't a disturbingly close second in that regard. \n\nI am insanely lucky to have ended up with the step family I got, and I know that. But just a quick reminder that it really does work out a decent amount of the time, you just hear about the problems and not the parts when it goes smoothly.", "Blended family kid here, but our situation is surely one of the better ones. Both my mother and step father each had two children from previous marriages (myself included), my step siblings get along with my brother and I fully, do we get on each others nerves sometimes, sure we do but for us it\u2019s like any sibling relationship, we\u2019re not always best friends and we have our arguments but we always resolve it amongst ourselves. Now my parents have also been incredibly smart in how they went into this, my step father treats my brother and I very equally to the way he treats his children. For Christmas my parents set the same budget for every single one of us that way nobody is being spent more/less money on. Financial help is always provided by both parents when necessary. Though it might also help that I\u2019m the only one who permanently lives with them, but that\u2019s because my step siblings are both younger (17 and 13) and so they visit on weekends and my brother is older than all of us (31) therefore our dynamics are very healthy around here.", "I disagree.

And yes, of course, Nina needs to be protected. It needs to start there. \n\nBut if you can't protect your child without *immediately* jumping to kicking your other kid out of the house, you're a shitty parent. I'm not saying that there isn't a place for physically separating kids, but telling your stepkid they have 48 hours to pack their shit is just bad parenting.

The more severe punishments do fall on parents to implement.  If you've been raising someone for 10 years, especially when they were little, you have to have the ability to admonish them.

It\u2019s okay for him to provide everything for her daughter but when she does shit behavior, he doesn\u2019t have rights because Kelly\u2019s actions have consequences  The reason is that she didn\u2019t bat an eye or fight for Nina when it came to moving her to the grandparents, by default Kelly would grab both bedrooms because of her entitlement which is one of the reasons she stays with mom and not dad.  Anna doesn\u2019t want her at her dad\u2019s because she would have to pay child support as the custody agreement would change.

IMO using her dad as a resource to offset you and your wife's inability to co-parent a child under your roof will just drive the wedge further.

Her dad's house should not be used as a makeshift prison for when you and your wife cannot figure out how to work as a team.

Her bullying is not acceptable, but there's got to be a solution that isn't just pouring water on a grease fire. ESH except Nina and the 6 year old. I'd suggest seeing if there's another school outside the ISD where the oldest child can go instead of the K-12 they share. Then focus on helping them cohabitate at home. If that teenager get's booted to her dads every time your family can't agree on a course of action to repair conflict, she'll never learn healthy conflict resolution skills and grow up to just run away from accountability and her problems. She'll also lose her trust in her dad because his house just becomes an extension of your abandonment. I don't speak without experience. I have 4 half siblings, 2 step dads, and our grandparents were also part of the mix in our collective rearing. There was no stability in the way they passed us around like potatoes when they were not suited to actually coach us through a conflict, and it felt like a never ending game of RISK or something. Now none of us can naturally handle conflict like an adult, and it makes having a job or a marriage a nightmare. l suggest you think about how these kids are going to be as adults based on these rash choices more than the in-the-heat of the moment feelings of righteousness. There must be a way to encourage your teen to do better and learn empathy while harboring safety for the middle child from the bullying. I would not suggest sending the middle child to some fancy charter school.

Anna only began to see a problem when she learned that her own youngest is also a target. If you do not stand up and protect your children, you\u2019ll be just as bad as those two.

Kelly\u2019s behaviour sounds totally inappropriate and I don\u2019t envy either of you as parents in having to deal with it. However, I agree that there is probably something more profound going on here. I doubt this is about physical space but maybe more so feeling unaccepted or unloved. \n\nI feel like there is an undertone of disdain in the way you describe Kelly in the post and comments (\u2018the amount of time she spends doing her makeup\u2019, reference to a makeup \u2018addiction\u2019, having more \u2018clutter\u2019 in her room). These are probably more or less factual statements but the fact you included these details and the way they are phrased makes me think you look down on her for this. Do you? If so, is it possible Kelly picks up on disdain from you or others in the household? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be overly psychoanalytical on a total stranger. I get that Kelly did a horrible thing so if you were feeling angry toward her when writing this post, I think that\u2019s understandable.

Instead of having money for makeup, she should receive it to get psychiatric help", "Kelly is going to emotionally destroy her sisters. This is beyond the pale.

All of us have parents we consider to be our proper parents based on who was actually there for us growing up and who wasn't and they're not necessarily our \"blood\" parents.\n\nIt's taken us \"kids\" to get to adulthood to really sort out all our relationships to each other and forge relationships we didn't always have as kids. But no matter what issues we had as kids none of us would've deliberately used our parentage as a weapon against each other though. \n\nThat's just nasty and cruel behaviour on the part of Nina in this story and as a 16 year old she would know better than that. I would've been horrified if any of my siblings had treated another in that way. Even when I was 16 and angry with both my step-parents and bio-dad, angry with different siblings at different times, I never once would've even considered using parents as a weapon against each other because blood-relation was the lowest blow we could've used against each other.", "His first response was to ask Kelly to apologize, but she refused.", "> There must be better ways to handle it\n\nYour suggestions are?", "Where my brain went as well - wondering if it's either something she's picking up from bio-dad or if she's being abused or something and lashing out because her younger sibs aren't.", "You should consider that Nina and 6yo will feel more attached to the house since its been in your family than Kelly will.  If they want to keep the house, Kelly could try to force a sale by not paying her share of property taxes, upkeep costs, etc.  Then she would keep a 1/3 interest without paying her fair share for upkeep.

Making Nina dependent on what Kelly will do when she has a share of the house is asking for trouble.  When Kelly decides she wants the money from the house and Nina and the 6 year old don't have the cash to buy it from her, they will be out on the street.  And them sharing will go about as well as it's going now, which is to say, Kelly will bully Nina and make life miserable for her to push her to leave the house so Kelly can have it to herself.", "Thanks!

Do you usually make such big decisions on your own?\n\nThis is also a child you have been helping raise for 10+ years, so do you care about this child? Because something is clearly wrong for her to be acting this way, and instead of getting her therapy or getting to the bottom of it, your solution is to throw the child away and have the father deal with it. That doesn't show a sign of much love to her, and it might show a picture of why she feels frustrated and unfavored to your biological children.\n\nMy older sister acted this way growing up. A young teenager with a lot of hate, anger, and resentment inside her, but my parents didn't make her live with someone else. And now today, she is the complete opposite.

I saw my little brother being picked on one time at school and I lost my shit. Nobody picks on my brothers but me, and I sure as shit am not going to intentionally give anybody any ammo to pick on them either.

So what you said directly applies to the OP even if you weren't responding to the OP.\n\nthe agreement came after, but he acted without having agreement, which was the whole issue (his wife thinking he's an asshole until she realized things were that serious). And the fact that his wife did not even realize Kelly said all those nasty things implies OP actually confronted Kelly himself, issued the dicipline, all of that without discussing with his wife first.\n\nand it sounds like people disagreeing with you are specifically disagreeing with the whole \"agreeable parameters\" aspect.\n\nPersonally I think it depends. If it's something small like \"you don't get to use your phone for a week\", a step parent shouldn't need permission to give that discipline.

It did give me hope and fuck do I need hope today.", "A child didn\u2019t choose to be born to a parent and it shouldn\u2019t suffer just because the parent wants sex.

Parental need for closeness and intimacy is important, but it shouldn\u2019t come at the behest of your child and if your relationships are damaging to your child, then you should choose your child. \n\nIf you want sex and intimacy above your child, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be a parent - at least not until your child is old enough to no longer be affected by your actions. \n\nHarsh, I know, but I\u2019ve seen too many parents only think about \u201ctheir\u201d needs and forget that their children are entirely dependent on them.", "I agree with \u2018agreed parameters\u2019 because if you have two people parenting they need to be on the same page. We\u2019ve had examples here where one parent doled out punishments like removing a door, destroying possessions, grounding a teenager for months, and that\u2019s not something that should be done unilaterally (or at all, really). \n\nBut making it about \u2018step\u2019 is a red herring. Teenager bullies another kid at school: consequences needed. Bullying a sibling, even if you don\u2019t like them: extra consequences. \n\nOne parent being on with bullying? Uh-oh.", "Are you sure YOU even know the full extent of what Kelly has been saying to the younger girls?  She got her high school friends to torment your daughter.  What else has she been doing when your back is turned and Anna is laughing about it?", "Based off this comment, and the fact that Kelly\u2019s rumours seems to be focusing on the mom side of things. \n\nHow are things between Nina and her maternal side of the family? Versus Kelly and her paternal side of the family?", "\u201cReward\u201d. That\u2019s a good way of summing it and you\u2019re exactly right.

He said she wasn\u2019t old enough to fully understand some of it but of course she is. Saying things like she\u2019s too heavy, and the only reason why she\u2019s smart and good in sports (sounds like some jealousy there) because her dad \u201cpays for them\u201d.  I mean extracurricular activities and sports cost money.  And maybe she has a tutor but he\u2019s literally not paying someone for the grade.  So she\u2019s getting these messages from a sibling that her successes aren\u2019t her own. And then saying these things to the six year old are absolutely horrible. \n\nI think the OP is missing the bigger issue here it shouldn\u2019t be AITAH for making her stay at her dads house until she apologizes. It should be how come I didn\u2019t know this was happening all this time (because believe me it didn\u2019t just start two or three months ago like they think) and perhaps WIBTAH  for making her live there until she\u2019s 18 because she\u2019s being emotionally abusive to my daughters. \n\nPoor kids.  Breaks my heart for them.  You know kids at school can be bullies and mean and have their clique\u2019s but when it\u2019s your own stepsister, somebody that you live with the majority of the time this is just extra hurtful.  It also makes their home no longer a safe place.  The trust is absolutely ruined here.

He needs to make sure that nothing he does to this minor(kelly is 16 being a bully doesn\u2019t change she is a minor.)child will hurt any future custody case for the 6 year old.\n\nAnger and rash decisions are not your friend in this situation.
