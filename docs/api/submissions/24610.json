I also have a step daughter \"Kelly\"(16f) and me and my wife \"Anna\" have a child(6f) together. This is about Nina and Kelly.\n\nI have met my wife when Kelly was 5 and within a year she and Kelly moved in with me. The house we live in has been in my family for generations and passed on to me when I was really young. I have also made some renovations there. It is a 4 bedroom house with 4 bathrooms (one is downstairs and is a guest one, with 3 upstairs, one is shared between 2 rooms), so each girl has her own room and an ensuite, which is especially helpful with Kelly due to how long she now takes with her make up. \n\nThis has started about a month ago when Nina would come home crying due to bullying at her school. Me and Anna spend ages trying to get the school to do something and find out where the bullying comes from. It all came to a conclusion a week ago when we found out that it was Kelly who was spreading the rumours about Nina. I was furious and confronted her about it as some rumors were based on Nina not having a mum (she died during childbirth).\n\nKelly didn't take the confrontation very well. She accused me of favouring Nina (Nina has slightly bigger bedroom but smaller bathroom) and Kelly wanted more space. I said I am not going to move Nina out of her room after all these years and Kelly has already declined to swap with us as she doesn't want to share her bathroom with anyone, including our 6 years old. I have told Kelly that she must apologise to Nina as some of the things she said were vile and not deserved and told her she will be grounded as she still behaved like Nina's friend while spreading those rumours behind her back. Kelly threw a fit and claimed Nina is a threat to her and her reputation, but I stayed firm as I don't see how a 12yo can be a threat to a highschooler? As Kelly started saying more vile things about Nina and our 6yo, I have told her she has 48 hours to pick her belongings and I will be dropping her off at her dad's (she visits him every other week), where she will have to share a room and the bathroom with her other half siblings. Kelly and Anna are both annoyed at me over this and have called me an asshole. Anna said I have no right to parent Kelly, but she is in my home and her behaviour towards my daughters is not acceptable.\n\nEdit: I might have worded it wrong, by dropping her off I don't mean Kelly will be living at her dad's permanently.

Straightener her out now, bulling is not acceptable.", "That's what I'm wondering", "Why would it get better when they're older?\n\nNina is growing up feeling that her older sister is a bully who hates her and attempts to hurt her in terrible ways that are hard to fix.  Nina is objectively correct.  That does not lead to it being better when they're older; it leads to your other daughters being permanently hurt and wanting nothing to do with Kelly as an adult.\n\nIf Anna wants it to get better once they are older, she needs to teach Kelly to _behave_ better now.  If she refuses to let you discipline Kelly then she should have done it herself, and done it so thoroughly that Kelly would never behave like this again.  She can't have it both ways; if you're not Kelly's parent and can't discipline her, then Kelly's welfare is not your responsibility.  And Nina's absolutely is.  You shouldn't be making your children live with a bully who is trying to hurt them.\n\nThis kind of bullying can hurt Nina's schooling, on a long term basis.  It causes trauma that hurts academic results and social integration.  This is serious, it's not like two children fighting over a toy.\n\nSo no, you shouldn't back down; you should be angry with Anna for refusing to discipline her child, leaving you with no other way to protect yours.  The ideal answer is for you both to treat all three as your children and teach them to live together as sisters... but Anna is actively sabotaging that; you can't treat them equally if one is immune to discipline and two are not.\n\nKelly is only a couple of years from being an adult.  When she's living with other people this kind of toxic behaviour will not magically be excused.  Anna is doing her no favours by teaching her there are no consequences for being a bully.\n\nThat said: This isn't a great call either.  Kelly has just been taught that the home is not really her home, outright validating her fear of inferior treatment.  It's going to be very, very hard now to stop her treating you as the enemy.  The right answer was to hammer this out with Anna first, and not let Anna duck out of taking responsibility for her daughter's bullying of children.", "Does Kelly have a better relationship with the siblings/half siblings at her fathers house?", "You\u2019re not helping the sister\u2019s war by thinking of rehoming a child. Kelly lives at the home with HER mother and you\u2019re making her feel like it could be taken from her. No 16 year old despite the poor behavior deserves that feeling. You\u2019re doing this all for your own daughter\u2019s sake which once again proves Kelly\u2019s point that you\u2019re favoring Nina over her and it\u2019s causing so many problems.

I could be wrong, but OP seems very much in denial about his role in this, also if he cares so much about Nina\u2019s well being, then shouldn\u2019t he put his ego aside and try to make things work with Kelly for his own daughter\u2019s sake?", "I\u2019m saying a 16 year old\u2019s irritation with her younger siblings is normal, but I definitely agree with you that getting others to bully your younger sibling isn\u2019t normal at all.

If she thinks that you have no right to parent HER child, after the two of you raised her since she was five then that's just wrong-headed thinking.  It also means that your wife and your step-daughter will gang up against you anytime they disagree with one of your parenting decisions.  You need to straighten that out right away.  As for the bullying, it seems like 'Kelly' could benefit from counseling as well as sensitivity training classes so that she can learn how her actions affect others.  Sure, it's not unreasonable for you to expect her to apologize to your other daughter but you can't force Kelly to do it, nor is it a good idea to threaten to kick her out if she doesn't.  That is going to drive a wedge not only between you and Kelly; Kelly and Nina but also between you and your wife.", "Bullying is a serious situation. I applaud you protecting your daughter.

And also to work out with your wife that, yes, you are both allowed to be parents and must be parents for this blended family to work. \n\nWhat Kelly did is very wrong, it absolutely has to stop, she has to be set straight and learn empathy and compassion, and you have to work together to figure out how to make that happen.", "ESH - I'm not going to call you an asshole bc it's understandable where your emotions are coming from.

I would recommend the step dad should be involved. \n\nBeing in a blended family and navigating these boundaries are more difficult than you think.

I hardly can imagine it's ok to decide alone to kick your stepdaughter out of the house without a conversation with her mother/your wife.\n\nAlso \"she is in my home and her behaviour towards my daughters is not acceptable.\". She is in her home too, if she's living there.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the bullying thing is terrible and from your story this Kelly doesn't seem like a good sister or daughter, but this said, from your post I read that you consider her a guest at your house and you naturally care more about your biological and smaller daughter, but this can be a really hard environment for a teenager to live in too, especially if it's you who makes the rule in the house.\n\nHer issues probably also have roots there, and her jealousy towards Nina may  have some grounds. The bullying is terrible and you and your wife have to deal with this, I'm just saying you probably have to think of the family and house in a different way if you want everyone to get along together better in the future.

My reasoning to say maybe not jumping to kicking her out is that the step daughter would feel like she is trash that can and will be thrown away when you guys get mad or tired of her.  She is a minor. By kicking her out your giving her father enough ammunition to take her away from your wife, who may never forgive you.\n\nSo before going the nuclear route I would suggest alternate the punishment to the following:\n\n1- counseling for kelly and Nina separately, and then counseling for the family. I suggest this first due to the fact that blended families are tough. It will help both girls. It will help get to the bottom of why kelly is doing this. It will be help Nina to deal with the bulling she has endured. It will help you and your wife on how to navigate your family.\n\n2- kelly has to attend a bullying class and pass it.\n\n3- kelly has to be grounded from friends, electronics, etc until you and your wife feel like it\u2019s a sufficient amount of time. \n\n4- after the completion of the bullying class kelly has to apologize.\n\n\nI would make it clear that if you choose this route that these terms are not negotiable. All terms have to be meet. If one term is not meet then kelly has to live with her dad until they are. If your wife does not agree make sure she realizes that she is more than welcome to leave also but she will not be taking the 6 year old after the vile and disgusting things she let her daughter say about her. You will not allow her to be bullied.\n\nThis route if this marriage does not work out at least your wife can not say your where abusive and made your 16 year old homeless. You can honestly say that you tried to get her help. Your wife was the one that would not agree to get her the help she needed and you will have a stronger case to keep full custody of the 6 year old if it comes to a divorce and custody battle.\n\nI would also keep all documentation on Kelly\u2019s disturbing behavior. Your wives reaction to it, the horrible vile things she says about your daughters. This could also come in handy if this comes to a divorce and custody battle.\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I understand wanting to throw kelly out to live with dad. But I believe you may be shooting yourself in the foot long term. Some times  doing stuff in anger hurts us in the long run.

And if she views that she\u2019s an outsider and that your 12 and 6 year olds aren\u2019t really ~~your~~ her family, or that they are more loved than she is, she won\u2019t respect them and may well continue to bully them.\n\nYou and your wife need to have a conversation to create a plan for how to deal with this. You are right that it is unacceptable for a 16-year old to bully a 12-year old sibling like this, but you need to both be on the same page on what the consequences will be. You are a step-parent. That means that you are in the 16-year old\u2019s life because her mother brought you into her life. And that means her mother needs to be there in lock-step with you in dealing with this in order to give it legitimacy. You should also have a conversation about getting therapy/counseling for your teenager.\n\nThen, you AND your wife need to have a conversation with your teenager and establish the following:\n\n1) She is a member of this household and is very much loved by both you and your wife, along with her sisters.\n\n2) It is unacceptable for family members to hurt each other the way that the 16-year old hurt the 12-year old.\n\n3) Reiterate that there are consequences for such behavior (EXCLUDING GOING TO FATHER\u2019S PLACE). And explain what the consequences will be if this behavior continues.", "Your 16 year old needs therapy like yesterday.
