I also have a step daughter \"Kelly\"(16f) and me and my wife \"Anna\" have a child(6f) together. This is about Nina and Kelly.\n\nI have met my wife when Kelly was 5 and within a year she and Kelly moved in with me. The house we live in has been in my family for generations and passed on to me when I was really young. I have also made some renovations there. It is a 4 bedroom house with 4 bathrooms (one is downstairs and is a guest one, with 3 upstairs, one is shared between 2 rooms), so each girl has her own room and an ensuite, which is especially helpful with Kelly due to how long she now takes with her make up. \n\nThis has started about a month ago when Nina would come home crying due to bullying at her school. Me and Anna spend ages trying to get the school to do something and find out where the bullying comes from. It all came to a conclusion a week ago when we found out that it was Kelly who was spreading the rumours about Nina. I was furious and confronted her about it as some rumors were based on Nina not having a mum (she died during childbirth).\n\nKelly didn't take the confrontation very well. She accused me of favouring Nina (Nina has slightly bigger bedroom but smaller bathroom) and Kelly wanted more space. I said I am not going to move Nina out of her room after all these years and Kelly has already declined to swap with us as she doesn't want to share her bathroom with anyone, including our 6 years old. I have told Kelly that she must apologise to Nina as some of the things she said were vile and not deserved and told her she will be grounded as she still behaved like Nina's friend while spreading those rumours behind her back. Kelly threw a fit and claimed Nina is a threat to her and her reputation, but I stayed firm as I don't see how a 12yo can be a threat to a highschooler? As Kelly started saying more vile things about Nina and our 6yo, I have told her she has 48 hours to pick her belongings and I will be dropping her off at her dad's (she visits him every other week), where she will have to share a room and the bathroom with her other half siblings. Kelly and Anna are both annoyed at me over this and have called me an asshole. Anna said I have no right to parent Kelly, but she is in my home and her behaviour towards my daughters is not acceptable.\n\nEdit: I might have worded it wrong, by dropping her off I don't mean Kelly will be living at her dad's permanently.

Nina is objectively correct.  That does not lead to it being better when they're older; it leads to your other daughters being permanently hurt and wanting nothing to do with Kelly as an adult.\n\nIf Anna wants it to get better once they are older, she needs to teach Kelly to _behave_ better now.  If she refuses to let you discipline Kelly then she should have done it herself, and done it so thoroughly that Kelly would never behave like this again.  She can't have it both ways; if you're not Kelly's parent and can't discipline her, then Kelly's welfare is not your responsibility.  And Nina's absolutely is.  You shouldn't be making your children live with a bully who is trying to hurt them.\n\nThis kind of bullying can hurt Nina's schooling, on a long term basis.  It causes trauma that hurts academic results and social integration.  This is serious, it's not like two children fighting over a toy.\n\nSo no, you shouldn't back down; you should be angry with Anna for refusing to discipline her child, leaving you with no other way to protect yours.  The ideal answer is for you both to treat all three as your children and teach them to live together as sisters... but Anna is actively sabotaging that; you can't treat them equally if one is immune to discipline and two are not.\n\nKelly is only a couple of years from being an adult.

You\u2019re doing this all for your own daughter\u2019s sake which once again proves Kelly\u2019s point that you\u2019re favoring Nina over her and it\u2019s causing so many problems.

So yeah I don't see this ending any other way quite frankly.", "Ok if Anna had an opportunity to try to fix it then NTA.\n\nThis might be the end of your marriage, but maybe that's for the best.", "Not even \u201cbad mouthing\u201d it sounds like appalling bullying. It\u2019s doubley worse as this is Nina\u2019s  stepsister who she has lived with her as a family since Nina was an infant. After 12 years and Kelly viciously bullies her and has caused an environment at Nina\u2019s school where other kids are bullying her also. Kelly needs to live with her Dad full stop", "Don't mind that comment, they're likely projecting.\n\nIt's not okay that you threatened to kick her out, but you weren't making her homeless, and she's been unapologetically making your kid's life hell.\n\nThe biggest AH here is Anna, not the bratty teen. The heck she on about, you not having the right to parent a child you've basically raised? Why isn't she disciplining her daughter? If Kelly has valid complaints (Nina secretly messing with her), why isn't her mother getting to the bottom of the situation?", "You\u2019re obviously doing something to make Kelly feel that you\u2019re favoring Nina over her even if you don\u2019t see it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s way beyond the room/bathroom sizing. Oh yeah just by you threatening to kick out a 16 year old for poor behavior to protect your own daughter is definitely you favoring your own daughter over your step daughter.", "And that's why you're the asshole. You've done way more harm to her than she has done to anyone. She'll never forgive that. Both you and her mother told her that she not a real family member. That's massively damaging. Forty years from now, she'll be telling her therapist what an asshole you were.", "L family arrangement mate", "No, you\u2019re totally right! Letting a 16 year old bully and degrade her younger step/half sisters to protect her \u201creputation\u201d in high school is totally justified. They absolutely should let her continue to create toxic environments for the younger children and provide no safe space for them. /s\n\nFOH with that nonsense! The 16 year old and mom are the only assholes here. They should both leave the giant free house OP provides.", "Then her mum can leave as well.", "As someone who was bullied by an older sibling and in school, I can say  it's not favouritism. It's being a parent. \n\n\nI got depressed and suicidal because my parents didn't believe me when I told them about what my brother did to me. They still don't.", "Average Reddit Pyschologist", "That's interesting, however we haven't spoken about inheritance in the house, so I'm not sure why she would think about it.\n\nThe current will is for Anna to inherit the holiday home and she can do whatever she wants with it. Kelly, Nina and the 6yo are inheriting the house and are on the will in equal proportions, with the only catch if they are to sell the house the family members have a first chance to buy it.", "I\u2019m also wondering if there is residual resentment from going from an only child to a blended family. Yes, many years have passed, but that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t impactful on her long term. \n\nBefore anyone responds, I do think Kelly is still wrong for lashing out how she is, just to be clear.", "This isn\u2019t a gender thing for me. The comment before me brought up the whole \u201cif roles are reversed\u201d and I just responded with how it wouldn\u2019t be fair.", "I agree", "Not projecting. I\u2019m trying to get OP to see the error in his ways.", "What am I supposed to do in a situation where an older child is bullying the younger for no reason? I have talked to her and suggested she can apologize and just be grounded for a bit as a consequence of her actions, which caused her to say more mean things about her sister including wishing her dying with her mother or making comments about Nina's and our 6yo weight (6yo is slightly chubby, but Nina is in a healthy weight for her BMI). I felt my only option was to drop her off at her dad's for a bit hoping she will come to her senses.\n\nSaying that it doesn't mean I don't ground my own daughter when she does something wrong and refuses to apologize. I have never asked any of them to babysit the other or to include the other one in their gatherings, so it is not like Nina is constantly bothering Kelly since they also have completely different interests and spend their days differently, being together probably during dinner or some family activities. So I don't get what Kelly's problem with Nina is since Nina is barely around her.", "Or maybe Kelly is just jealous she's not an only child anymore. She literally stated the bullying of her 12yo sister and also saying shit about her and their 6yo sister. If she has so much crap to say she's better of living at her dad's where she doesn't have to be with the sisters she seems to hate so much.", "They can put a stop to Kelly\u2019s cruel behavior WITHOUT temporarily rehoming her.", "Mum probably shares the same opinion. Why is OP wasting money on his daughter from his ex, when he should be spending everything he has on her little princess!", "That\u2019s different cause OP is actually thinking for his daughter and trying to hold Kelly accountable and I definitely think Kelly should be punished, but do you not think it\u2019s too extreme for threatening to send her to her dad\u2019s? I don\u2019t think OP is wrong to ask Kelly to apologize and be nicer by the way.", "It\u2019s just an hypothesis, specially given you said she got step siblings on her dad\u2019s side. It sure doesn\u2019t make sense attacking a 6 year old and saying vile things unless there\u2019s a lot of preferential treatment going on which doesn\u2019t seem like it.\n\nWhat it seems that Kelly hates your other children now. The reason is what you need to find given she said you prefer Nina over her. \n\nHonestly attacking a 12 year old that has never know her mum and could take her existence as the reason why is actually really bad and could seriously scare Nina mentally, you should make sure that she gets proper counseling.", "Bad move, OP! What happens to Nina if something happens to you? Would your wife let Nina inherit from her? Would she take care of Nina as well as she would her bio daughters? Or would she just enable Kelly's bullying of her?\n\nI think Nina needs more financial padding incase anything happens to you. Kelly can inherit from her mum and her dad. Nina only has you.\n\nEdited.", "Nta on of topic but I actually don\u2019t think the current will is fair to Nina. Who is to say Anna will share equal proceeds of the vacation home between all three girls? If she is already not helping out with situation.", "definitely projecting", "Mmmm I still don\u2019t feel as if Kelly is bullying her \u201cfor no reason\u201d but whatever. What you don\u2019t do is threaten to kick her out. She deserves to be punished for her rude behavior for sure, but to get kicked out? Most 16 year olds would be out of the house if their poor behavior warranted it. Dropping her off at her dad\u2019s will make the situation worse for everyone, it could hurt the relationship between Kelly and her own mom. If you drop her off at her dad\u2019s on Nina\u2019s behalf, in her eyes, it will confirm her feelings about you favoring Nina over her all along. She\u2019s not gonna come to her senses. \n\nYou and your wife should come to an agreement on what to do with Kelly first of all. That\u2019s another thing you did wrong here was not handle this situation with your wife as the partners you are supposed to be. You need to get to the bottom of Kelly\u2019s disdain for her sisters. Tell your wife to separately have Kelly confide in her what\u2019s been bugging her about your other daughters, without you being there, otherwise Kelly won\u2019t be open or truthful. Also make sure your wife makes it clear to Kelly that she needs to stop being cruel to Nina. Kelly clearly seems to already expect you to always favor your own daughter over of her just because she\u2019s not your own for that reason alone. I feel like the more you are at odds with Kelly, the more she\u2019ll antagonize Nina and you don\u2019t want that. Say this to Kelly, \u201cI am sorry for making you feel like that I favor Nina over you. That is not my intention at all and I truly want to you guys to have equal treatment. I am sorry for threatening to send you to your dad\u2019s because you will always have a place in this home and we want you here\u201d", "Maybe Kelly\u2019s jealousy comes from her step sister being favored over her? It\u2019s on the adults for her not to feel that way. What 16 year old wouldn\u2019t feel annoyed and have crap to say about annoying little siblings to begin with? That\u2019s normal but getting threatened to get kicked out for it is not normal.", "They clearly can\u2019t. According to OPs comments mom has already talked to her about it and it\u2019s gotten worse because clearly neither mom nor Kelly think this is a big deal. Mom doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big enough deal to take any kind of actual corrective action and apparently won\u2019t let OP do anything about it. The safest thing for OPs kids is both Mom and Kelly leave until Kelly gets help and actually understands what she did is fucking abhorrent. OP needs to protect the younger siblings for EVERYONES SAKE or this is just going to keep spiraling out of control and will have huge knock on consequences later on.", "It's both too extreme and the _least_ extreme option OP has.  The correct answer is discipline at home, but Anna is refusing to let him do that and appears to be actively minimising the seriousness of the situation.  Which means the many much better options are not on the table.", "Wasn\u2019t going to bring it up but yeah do agree with you that the current will is not fair to Nina. OP as Nina only parent should make sure that she is given a fair share or well look after unless she has something that her birth mum would have pass to her.\n\nHonestly, as you said there\u2019s no guarantee that Anna will split it equally to the 3 given it\u2019s going to her choice. Possibility of passing it to just Kelly and the 6 yr old is existent.", "Agree. Why is even Kelly in the will? She has two parents to inherit. Nina should inherit most since I assume she has not got the part from her mother? If you die first, who will inherit the summer house after your wife? My guess Kelly and 6 years old. Your will will in the end benefit your daughter\u2019s bully.", "THIS !!!!!\nI was actually wondering if it was Kelly\" or \"Anna\"  that had written that. \n\nNTA OP but your wife and daughter are..I understand Kelly is 16 but she knew exactly what she was saying and how cruel she was being and your wife clearly doesn't give a f***. \nIf I ever did anything like that to my wn sister, my mum would tear me a new one and I would expect that. \n\nMaybe, your wife needs to go have a time out elsewhere with Kelly as well BC she's clearly not protecting either of her two other daughters.", "From the info we have that OP gives, it seems to come from a sense of entitlement, not unfairness/others being favored.\n\n>What 16 year old wouldn\u2019t feel annoyed and have crap to say about annoying little siblings to begin with?\n\nSure being annoyed by little siblings is normal. Starting a rumor to get them bullied is not. You don't seem to comprehend the kind of damages being bullied will do to you, even more so when it's about your mom's death.", "Getting the school yard to bully your sister for things entirely not true and or out of their control is not normal 16 year old behaviour. Getting sent to live with the other parent or grandparent is something that happens to 16 year old's that are out of control. I know of several families that have done this and it is extreme but usually resolves within a few months. They aren't making the child homeless and if the mother is decent she will make an effort to keep the relationship up.", "Mom probably doesn\u2019t think what her daughter did was bad enough or a big deal enough to get threatened to sent to her dad\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean mom doesn\u2019t see this as a big deal at all. Mom also tried to find out who was behind the rumors as OP said. See this is my point when I say that OP was extreme for even threatening to send Kelly to her dad\u2019s, it just minimized everything else that even mom discarded this as a \u201csister war\u201d in context. From all of the information you gathered from OP, it\u2019s still not enough for you to conclude that mom didn\u2019t try to at least tell her daughter to leave the little girl alone. You\u2019re acting like mom is encouraging this behavior intentionally when I doubt that\u2019s the case but she\u2019s not gonna want her biological to be moved.", "I could see it coming from a sense of entitlement maybe, but I don\u2019t know how you can\u2019t see it coming from a sense on unfairness/others being favored when from info OP gives, Kelly specifically says that Nina is being favored over her. \n\nIf Kelly hates Nina so much to do such cruel things, then it\u2019s a much deeper issue that I think is most likely coming from the parents. I could be wrong, but OP seems very much in denial about his role in this, also if he cares so much about Nina\u2019s well being, then shouldn\u2019t he put his ego aside and try to make things work with Kelly for his own daughter\u2019s sake?", "I\u2019m saying a 16 year old\u2019s irritation with her younger siblings is normal, but I definitely agree with you that getting others to bully your younger sibling isn\u2019t normal at all. BUT since that is already happening, it is on the parents for BOTH of their kids\u2019 sake to get to the bottom of it and really reevaluate their own behavior to see if they might be adding to it and I honestly think OP is. \n\nI assume OP is white cause I\u2019m from a completely different culture where a kid\u2019s behavioral issues are never resolved just by sending them off to live with another family member or relative. I don\u2019t think it solves anything, the kid just knows not to pull that crap at other people\u2019s houses but it doesn\u2019t address the underlying issue. This is just strange to me to dump your kid, who is your responsibility, off to another person to deal with when their causing you issues like nah that\u2019s your mess to clean up"]}
