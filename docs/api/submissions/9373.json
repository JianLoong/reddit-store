I mean your mother died and all she could do is get you a speeding ticket, after basically driving your car without a permit", "NTA, get your own lawyer. Honestly the friendship is toast already, she tried to fuck you over after you already offered to pay her fine (did you ever even give her permission to drive the car, or just hold onto the keys?) she\u2019s not going to back down on this, so don\u2019t feel bad and fight back.", "NTA.  Did you show the court evidence that you were out of the country?  I find it hard to believe that the court didn\u2019t consider that.", "NTA but please lawyer up.", "NTA.\n\nWell in Germany you *can (no must see below)* be at fault if you are the owner when you are not able to provide evidence who drove your car.  This mainly happens if the authorities can\u00b4t proof that the actual driver was in fact driving the car. This happens for example if the photo of the incidient isn\u00b4t clear or partially obstructed somehow. ( Here in Germany many intersections are equipped with Redlight/Speedcameras that automaticly measure speed and also take a picture of you if you ran the red ligth).\n\nHowever due to the fact that you got also proof that you where not even remotely able to be driving on this day no judge will be able to force you to pay the fine or get the points/suspension.\n\nBut a judge can rule that from now on it\u00b4s mandatory to keep record of whom/when and how much is driving by a so called \"Fahrtenbuch\" /Drivers logbook.\n\nIf you are member of any kind of Drivers association like ADAC or similar just contact their lawyers they will help you for free.", "NTA. You should provide everything required not just to try and avoid this, but your supposed friend betrayed your trust and looks to stick you the repercussions of their actions. If driving is so important to their job maybe they shouldn't have taken your car without your knowledge, broken traffic laws and then thrown you under the bus.\n\nThis person isn't your friend.", "NTA\n\nYou need a lawyer and fight this. Fines are one thing but points are a shit show to get rid off once you have them. That's insane that your \"friend\" is so careless with 1.your car and 2.your license (since you could lose it if you get more points).", "NTA, but I wouldn't get my hopes up on her doing the right thing. She already lawyered up to take the blame off of herself, I don't believe she would be in a hurry to rescind it.", "NTA -- and I don't know anything about German law, but how can the court place the blame on you, if you can prove you weren't in the country? \n\nDo you have any records -- emails, texts, etc. -- proving you gave her the keys to your car while you were away?\n\nI think hiring your own lawyer in this case would be money well-spent. \n\nAnd most important, I would start referring to this person as an EX-friend.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what the law is in Germany but in the UK where I live it\u2019s an offence for someone to claim they weren\u2019t the person driving & they can go to jail. It happened to an MP (lawmaker) and both he & his wife did jail time.", "NTA you need to lawyer up and counter sue. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is a massive asshole for doing this to you.", "NTA.

If your friend were decent, she'd do the right thing. Unfortunately it seems like she's decided to go the legal route.", "NTA, also, she was supposed to watch your car, not drive it.
