But I\u2019ve learned that it doesn\u2019t really help anything, your brothers not going to listen to you if you try to make him feel stupid and this type of stuff is not worth the drama and stress it causes. At least for me. So technically you\u2019re not wrong but you you\u2019re still TAH. You should think about what you care more about: your brothers well being or being right.
