Meaning that you will never see that 25k again.", "I always get irritated when people think it\u2019s ok to make poor financial decisions and expect others to bail them out!

If he isn't willing to do it, it means he has no plans to become financially responsible.  But if he does, you need to stop whining about his wedding, enough already!  AND when you are going over his budget, don't be a judgemental ass, he has different priorities than you.  Your job is to make sure it is feasible, not to comment on how they spend it.", "NTA.

It was a good idea to ask about how much the wedding cost to see how he handled his finances at the time and whether or not he would be truthful with you. While being brothers it would be good to be honest with one another to have each others backs. It would be best to not give your brother financial support and have him come to terms with the reality of the situation he is in. He can either take the honest truth or continue down a path that will lead to nothing but trouble. \n\nAdditionally it would be best to secure your own finances and ensure that no one will be attempting to commit any fraudulent activities with your name.", "Yeah that's a YTA move. You just wanted to say I told you so.", "YTA\n\nNot loaning him Jack would have been perfectly reasonable but you chose to be a dick about it and really stuck the knife in. You were TRYING to hurt him. So my question would be why? Why make it hurt? It's not just disagreeing with how he spent the money... you're not telling us something cause the way you talk about him tells me you likely haven't been on good terms for YEARS. Especially not going to his wedding after you told him to get a prenup.", "Since the question is about asking the cost of the wedding, YTA. You aren\u2019t for not lending him money.

Say no have some class and keep your \"lessons\" to yourself.", "YTA- not sure what the wedding has to do with anything.  It\u2019s not surprising that he spent money unwisely as he got it when he was 23 and you were apparently 33.  That\u2019s the fault of the person who created the trust, as lots put age limits on them precisely for this reason. It\u2019s fine not to lend him money, but no need to be a jerk about the wedding.  I don\u2019t think spending less on the wedding would have changed this situation significantly since he probably would still have overextended himself on the mortgage.", "YTA - that\u2019s a low blow. We all spend money on things other people would consider frivolous. It\u2019s crappy of you to try to hold that over his head now.", "YTA. You're not obligated to lend him a huge sum of money, for sure.  But its also not up to you to \"teach him a lesson\" or berate him for indulging on what he assumed was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime celebration of their lives together.  Would I pay 40K for a wedding? Absolutely the fuck not.  Have I made other choices that in hindsight were not the best, monetary or otherwise? Sure as shit have.\n\nMust be nice to be so flawless and do everything right all the time that you feel it's up to you to hand out life lessons to your family cause they aren't as perfect as you, OP.", "YTA. It's fine that you don't want to lend him money, but you went out of your way to be as unkind as possible.", "YTA, mildly. \n\nYou should have just said \"yes\" or \"no\" and carried on with your day. \n\nSince you would have said \"no\" regardless of his answer about the wedding costs, you had no need to seek that information.", "YTA. Their wedding isn't your business, and honestly, 40k is not a very expensive wedding at all.", "YTA....what he did spend on his wedding is not any of you concern.", "YTA and you're not his father. A simple yes or no to his request would sufficed, but you decided to bring up past mistakes.", "NTA for not loaning money to your brother, but WTH does the wedding or prenup have to do with anything?  He has zero dollars, so a prenup for nothing is meaningless.
