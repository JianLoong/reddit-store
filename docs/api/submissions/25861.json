His mother sounds like she will do a good job of teaching him that", "Don't worry about her.  Let it roll off your back, and continue on with your day.\n\nThe child asked to carry the bags, and you made sure they weren't;t heavy.

You should have seen the pride in his face when I told him the baby is so lucky to have him as a big brother", "NTA. It was a sweet thing for him to offer. Even if some of it was heavy, the most I would have done differently is split the bags up giving him some light ones and thank him profusely for lightening the load.

Good show!", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, but does his mother have any idea about how 5 year olds function? They have poor emotional regulation and say things simply and straight to the point.

This is so wonderful but I can kinda get mom\u2019s concern/suspicion.", "This is my favourite comment, everyone else go home.", "Gotta go NAH on this one. You aren't an AH, but neither is the mother because that seems like a pretty normal reaction to seeing your 5 year old child carrying a bunch of bags for their empty-handed step mother. Obviously it looked much worse than it was, but she had no way of knowing the situation at first glance.", "NTA - just make sure your husband knows all the details just in case this becomes any further of an issue.", "\"Here, make yourself useful.\" Somehow just heard my dad's voice in my head\n\nNta", "NTA, as boy I can confirm, we are failures if we cannot carry as many groceries bags in at once as we are years old\n\nYour stepson wanted to carry it, so long as you thanked him and didn\u2019t pressure him you are fine", "The kid definitely takes after his dad", "Dude I remember telling my mom when I was little that I would get the groceries because I was a big kid and could do it myself. That novelty wore off pretty fast but still you're nta he wanted to help.", "Nta", "NTA but it isn't worth pursuing either.", "And she shouldn\u2019t have made assumptions either.", "NTA.\n\nWe called my oldest girl our little sheepdog, because she _loved_ having a specific task to work on.  If left unsupervised, she could - much like a border collie - get a bit destructive, and any babysitter who tried to just sit her down in front of the TV complained that she was wriggly and whiny and wouldn't listen, but I could literally snap her out of a sulking tantrum by saying \"Hey sweetpea, I need your help with something, could you come help me please?\"\n\nKids in general love feeling useful.  They love feeling like they're contributing, and there are entire schools of pedagogy (like for instance Montessori) built around encouraging children to develop independence through practicing daily activities - which is to say, chores.\n\nEncouraging children to participate actively in the world and its responsibilities is the best way to raise functional adults.  Does it take longer to do the grocery shopping when my youngest insists on pushing the cart all by herself?  Well yeah, obviously.  But letting her contribute like that also turns a mundane errand into an opportunity to teach her about respecting other people's space, and saying \"Excuse me please\" if someone is blocking the aisle, and of course I talk to her constantly about what we're buying and ask her to help make choices: \"Do you think we should get apples or oranges today?  Would you prefer raisins or almonds for your snack?\"  And what that means, in practical terms, is that even at the age of four, she feels that she's a contributing member of the family whose opinions are valued and respected.\n\nParents like your stepson's bio mom think they're helping their kids by not expecting anything of them - \"let them be kids\" and \"they're only young once\" are their rallying cries - but they're actually hurting them.  By not having expectations for their children, all they're doing is teaching their kids not to expect anything from themselves. They're the kind of parents who raise kids who don't know how to do laundry or cook, and who manage to graduate college without ever having cleaned a toilet in their lives.  That's not doing them any favours, and they're denying their children the opportunity to earn genuine and heartfelt praise for being good and helpful little humans.\n\nYour stepson sounds like a great kid, you sound like a great (step)mom, and bio mom needs to read a goddamned parenting book.", "How would that possibly make you TA?", "NTA, and that's adorable.", "NTA - have you mentioned it to your partner? Might be good to get ahead of it in case his ex makes a fuss.", "NTA\n\nMom is just looking to stir up shit.\n\nYour stepson is very sweet and I hope you bragged on him to his dad.\n\nIt's clear the two of you have a great relationship.", "That may be, but she had no justification for flying off the handle. All she had to do was ask a question, calmly and politely, and she would have learned that there was no reason to be upset. She could have asked her son (nicely) why he was carrying all those bags, and he probably would have told her, full of pride, that he wanted to help OP. She could have asked him if they were heavy, or praised him for being so kind and told him he was obviously very strong. Or she could have (again, nicely) asked OP why her son was carrying the bags \u2013 and then praisdd her son for being so thoughtful and helpful and kind. But no, she leapt to a conclusion, blew her too, and probably confused the hell out of her little boy. She's definitely an AH.", "Honestly, it's good to include the stepkid in things like this so they don't feel like they are being replaced by the new baby. Especially if they ask.\n\nEdit: word", "Maybe pick out a present he will love for the baby to give him when they are born. It helped when we had our 2nd, we got a barking dog for our eldest and he carried it everywhere except for when he would \"play\" with his baby bro. He saw the baby cry when he made it bark and decided to only play with it when the baby was sleeping (except for when he got tired to and decided he was having a nap with the baby too).\n\nAs for partners ex, just tell him what happened and hopefully he will see how much you love his son. Oh and my eldest got his father and grandfather in trouble by saying the same thing as your Stepson but to his grandmother after she broke her hand doing something she should have asked my hubby and FIL to do \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Kids are honest and caring, sometimes too honest, eldest told grandma \"you can't do that because daddy and poopy will get angry at me for letting you do that\" then he did it for her \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "Don't lie!
