We know each other for about a year now.\n\nWe were working late together on campus on a robot for our student club and when it was time to go home around midnight she asked me to walk her to her car which was parked a 7 minute walk away.\n\nI was not comfortable and refused, because I get uncomfortable on those streets at night as there are people who seem to be on drugs who just shout things and talk to themselves. I've never had anyone attack me but it makes me uncomfortable. Additionally she is a young woman and I'm not her boyfriend, I don't know if she has one but if she did, he would probably not approve of it and if could get mad at me. I have had boyfriends of girls I know do this before.\n\nThe next day she told me she was a little disappointed as she had volunteered to walk with me between two campus buildings and back late at night on a different occarion when I had to fetch something from the other building. She also said that I could have dropped her to the parking and taken a different route to my dorm from there and not have to pass through the sketchy street alone, which is true or I could have taken her offer to drive me home.\n\nAITA here? I feel like her volunteering to walk with me is not the same as it was not as bad of a route and I never asked her to do so even if I did take up her offer. And while it's true I could have avoided them after dropping her, I'd still be a little uncomfortable if I encountered weirdos while with her. I don't want this to turn into a big issue as we work well together and I'm hoping to keep doing group projects with her in other classes.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to mention that I did tell her the next day that I understood and would help next time, when she told me about it. But I'm just wondering if I was wrong for that day when she asked.\nEDIT2: I've apologized to her profoundly and said I was being an ass. I'm not an idiot and I know it can be dangerous for women, I would have done it for a friend or my sister but I was being an ass and not considering her to be a friend and more like a stranger I tend to meet often which was clearly wrong of me.", "created_utc": 1676197041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110chns/aita_for_not_walking_a_school_acquaintance_to_her/", "score": 755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You claim that the path to her car is sketchy and you would never walk it alone. Why would you make her do that by herself. Safety in numbers here buddy.\n\nWhy couldn't she give you a ride to your place after you walk her?", "YTA and the whole boyfriend thing you use as an excuse is just really weird.\n\nINFO: have you ever been in a relationship? This screams of awkwardness with someone of the opposite sex because of a lack of experience.", "YTA you didn't want to walk her because of the scary people she'll walk by so you just have her go walk in front of the scary people alone?\n\nShe should change lab partners", "YTA. A person is telling you that they are afraid and you did nothing to help. The excuse that her boyfriend might get mad is total BS. He would be happy that someone helped her out. Would driving her to her car really have cost you so much time? How would you feel if something had happened to her that night? You don't sound like a very nice person. Sorry", "So, you wanna keep the good and convenient parts of your working relationship / friendship / whatever this is, but avoid the inconvenient parts?\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI promise that however uncomfortable those weirdos make you feel, it's 100x worse for a young female walking alone at night.", "Info: why couldn\u2019t you walk her to the car and her drop you off at yours? Sounds like a place a woman shouldn\u2019t be walking around alone at night.", "YTA \n\nIf something had have happened to her I can't help but feel your response would be \"I knew I was right about that area. Thank God I didn't go there. Sad she died though as her contribution to class projects was useful to me. Oh well. I'll have to find someone else. Oh the inconvenience\"", "YTA\n\nIf someone feels unsafe and ask me to accompany them to feel better I will do so, no matter if friends, \u201eacquaintance\u201c, random person of my class who I hardly ever spoke to.\n\nFeeling unsafe to walk back alone is valid, so you communicate and work together like \u201eSure I\u2018ll walk you to your car, could you drop me off here again because I don\u2018t feel comfortable walking back alone?\u201c \n\nProblem solved.\n\nYou\u2018re very selfish and show that it\u2018s not worth working together with you as you\u2018ll think about nothing but your comfort.", "My god, by the 3rd paragraph itself you had a truckload of excuses ready. YTA", "YTA. You as a man felt unsafe, how do you think she felt as a woman? She was scared and asking for help and you just refused to help her. Have some empathy", "YTA. No one should ever put themselves in a potentially dangerous position if they don't feel comfortable doing so but by your own admission it was possible to take a safer route\n\nOf course the real villain here is your university. 7 minutes from campus via crack den? That seems like an oversight.", "YTA. You are not obligated to walk her but choosing to not is an ahole move. You should have said something like \u201cI\u2019ll walk you if you will drop me off at my dorm.\u201d Also, as to the the concern about her having a boyfriend, if anything he should be grateful you walked with her. \n\nPS: Many campuses have safety officers to walk with students. Does your campus have such a program at all?", "When I was in grad school, our classes were almost 6-9 pm.  The city this school was in is a high crime city.  The classes were in a specialized building for particular sciences.  The parking lot was adjacent to the building.  By the time our classes and labs finished, the parking lot would be mostly empty.  Even then, a group of us would get together and walk to our cars together.  Before leaving, we all made sure we all made to our cars safely.  Sounds like a lot but it was necessary to make sure we were safe.  Totally worth it.", "YTA", "DUDE if you as a man feel uncomfortable and scared how do you think she feels. She's more in danger than you. She asked you to go so you could protect her. I'm not saying you're an Asshole but this posts reads like parody that you somehow dont get the irony of how you're so scared to walk there yet you want her to go by herself?", "In college I was a woman in a STEM career.  Many of the guys walked with me if we stayed late and I just drove them to their car or apartment if they lived close to the university.  It was appreciated for sure.", "YTA", "YTA, this reminds me of the question often asked of men: if you had to take a small pay cut to greatly increase the pay of your female colleagues to be equal to yours, would you do it? Clearly your answer is no. You are in far less danger walking through a sketchy area than she is, but because it makes you uncomfortable, you would prefer she be in active danger.", ">I'd still be a little uncomfortable if I encountered weirdos while with her. \n\n\n\nYea better the weirdos see her walking alone and she encounters them all by herself.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t even because your a dude, Im a pretty weak woman and still get asked to walk places with a friend (or loudly video chat with them) so that they aren\u2019t walking sketchy places alone. It\u2019s a normal thing people do for each other.\n\n\n\nPersonally I think you suck for leaving her to fend for herself, and I hope she doesn\u2019t continue to work with you as you aren\u2019t someone who\u2019d have her back in even the most bare minimum way. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d call you an asshole for it, a coward definitely.", "YTA.\n\nSo you do all this stuff together but when she asks to help her out in one instance that makes even you, a male uncomfortable (I don\u2019t give a shit how tall you are) you think it\u2019s so much easier for her? Grow a spine", "YTA. I can't believe you are so cowardly, insensitive and selfish. Do you know that women are more at risk of assault walking at night than men are? Of course you do but you chose to expose this girl to that added risk rather than do the right thing. You ought to be as ashamed of yourself as everyone here is of you.", "Absolutely the ASSHOLE.", "So you're uncomfortable because you recognize that they're unsavory characters you'd have to pass to get to her car.. why do you think she asked you if you could walk her to the car? Clearly she's uncomfortable too.\n\nThe best option would have been for both of you to walk to your car and then you give her a ride to hers. I'm a traditionalist though", "YTA and also a coward", "YTA, women are more prone to being victimized if seen walking alone at night. Could have walked together and she could have dropped you off", "This can't be a real post. You really can't be this thick.", "YTA. \n\nShe didn\u2019t want to walk alone for the same reasons you are afraid of walking there alone. It\u2019s not even necessarily about you being a dude, it\u2019s about there being a second person walking. As a woman, I can think of a hundred times my female friends walked each other to cars and then were driven to our cars or home. \n\nBecause more people is more secure. \n\nHave you ever heard the phrase \u201csafety in numbers?\u201d That\u2019s what she was looking for. She probably wanted to get home sooner too, but she had to walk a longer route - a route which may still be unsafe alone - because you couldn\u2019t spare ten minutes to walk someplace uncomfortable with her and get a ride home.", "I am going soft YTA. The reason being that while you are not obligated to do this as so many comments imply and suggest. I think under the circumstances you should have done it because of the general safety in numbers. In addition it appears that she offered to drop you off after meaning you did not have to walk back the same way thereby putting yourself in danger. \n\nI think your comments about her boyfriend are irrelevant here. It is her choice what she chooses to do with her relationship. From reading the post and your comments, it just seems like you yourself are scared and did not want to put yourself in danger. I don't think you are an ass for not choosing to put yourself in danger for another person, that is a personal choice and one not everyone can make.\n\nFinally, I was rubbed the wrong way by so many commenters that implied that as a guy it was his role to play knight in shining armour regardless of the circumstances. I would do this and have done this for both male and female friends and have had the same done for me, but I do not expect anyone to do this for me nor would I feel good if it was taken as an obligation.", "YTA. Good thing nothing happened to her that night.", "YTA and she knows and so do her friends. I would have walked her to safety and not for the reason above. Can you imagine if she was harrassed or attacked and you by just being there could have prevented it. How would you feel? Like others have said it's much worse for a woman", "YTA. Safety in numbers. There's such a thing as projecting confidence, not potential victim. You can still be afraid and do the right thing anyway. Women do this for each other all the time.", "Hard YTA!", "YTA, you\u2019re too scared to walk down the same road.", "Hey OP, why don't you show this post and comments, along with your replies, to the woman in question and let us know what she says?", "YTA and a major one at that. She literally told you she doesn\u2019t feel safe and you did nothing about it. If I was here I wouldn\u2019t be friends with you anymore tbh.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou mention you as a 21M were uncomfortable walking through the area alone, how do you think a 21F would feel?\n\nYou could have also driven her to her car, her in the backseat if you were concerned about impropriety.\n\nA friend asked you for help in a confronting situation and you told them no?", "YTA. Thoughtless and rude behaviour.", "YTA.  You were uncomfortable, how do you think she felt?", "So you as a young man didn't feel safe somewhere. Your solution to this was to leave a young woman to go there herself instead. YTA. You might want to look up the definition of the word coward too.", "YTA. Wow", "YTA That was just awful. You were more worried about yourself than her. Not just an AH but a bad friend and crummy person.", "YTA.  If that's how you treat an \"aquaintance\" I can't imagine that you have many friends.", "Ask yourself how you would feel about your decision if she was attacked? So yeah, YTA.\n\n~~But also, why couldn't she have driven you to where you needed to go after collecting her car, so your own fears about walking alone were allayed?~~  Already answered elsewhere.", "YTA, I'm not dismissing your own fear but the reality is a woman is more likely to be a target than you as a man. Why you didn't offer to drive her or walk with her and get her to drive you to your car is beyond me.\n\nOh and the bf thing is crap, why you taking that into consideration instead of her actual physical safety?\nI appreciate you coming here to ask for advice and have taken steps to help in the future. Kudos on that.", "YTA. Wow, what an ass! You wouldn\u2019t walk the path to her car alone, yet you made a woman do it. Turn in your man card.", "YTA", "YTA. If you feel uncomfortable as a man, she would feel many times as uncomfortable as a woman. You don't have to think about what you should do next time, because she won't ask you again, and neither will her friends.", "YTA. Clearly.  \n\n\nYou let a young woman walk alone in the dark in an area that you deemed dangerous? Not cool. And don't give us that boyfriend BS.\n\nAs a human, you need to decide what kind of human you want to be. Are you going to be the type of human who seeks to assist and protect those around him who may be more vulnerable or no? To me, a man or a woman who always helps others in whatever capacity they can makes them a more respectable human and that is something we should strive for.\n\nNext time, walk with her, and then have her drop you off wherever you needed to go. Win for both of you.", "I'm going to say NTA. He was uncomfortable walking down the streets at night. He shouldn't have to do something he's uncomfortable cause a woman ask him to walk with her.
