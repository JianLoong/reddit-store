{"id": 33780, "submission_id": "18r73pc", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to stay with me for Christmas instead of going to visit his parents?", "selftext": "I (31F) had a really, really bad cold this Christmas, I don't think I've had one like this ever since I was a kid. \n\nInitially I was supposed to go with my husband(32M) to go visit his parents that live 5 hours away. We were supposed to leave on 23rd of dec and come back on 27. \n\nAnyway, I realised on 22 that my cold was REALLY bad and that I couldn't leave with him. I actually asked him to stay with me instead (I didn't think it's a crime to miss Christmas at his folks for ONE year) but he insisted on going alone. \n\nI asked him multiple times to stay, but he just got me some meds and provisions and left. I've also asked him yesterday to return a day earlier, but he once again refused. \n\nAnyway, what really ticked me off is that I started watching a movie by myself (and he insisted that I close it and wait for him to return and watch it together--- and he also mentioned that with a tv show and another movie). It really pissed me off because I don't think he's in a position to make demands like that since he refused all my requests to not go/come back early.\n\nI also gotta mention that my MiL and FiL hate me and actually insisted that he stays there for a few more days. \n\nAITA? I dumno if i'm exagerrating a bit, I kinda feel that I am.\n\n\nEdit:Making this additional post because I can't comment because of lack of karma. \n\nWanted to give a bit more information on the issue. \n\n1.I'm from an Eastern European country, so I guess Christmas is pretty important for my in-laws. We usually go there together for Christmas. Last year I didn't go because I worked(but I didn't ask him to stay home with me ofc, so he went alone and I didn't mind it because I wasn't bedridden lmao. So it's not like it's a common occurence for me to beg him to spend Christmas with me. \n\n2.The commenters have a theory, and I agree. I do think he may have through I was exaggerating my cold in order to make him not go. Could be, especially since he knows that I don't feel comfortable visiting them. My husband is indeed an only child(as some commenters speculated), and my MiL does little to hide her distaste for me. She made a scene at our wedding and constantly makes disparaging remarks about me. Truth be told, I do think she's a hateful woman in general, she isn't that much nicer to my husband. My FiL is mostly passive aggresive and mocks me when we talk, but nothing as hateful as my MiL. So, I do suspect my husband thought I might be exaggerating in order to not go. However, I really am very sick. I barely made it through the last days at work. (because I couldn't take free time from work), so I basically collapsed in bed on the 22nd. I haven't left the house since. I have a fever, a really bad cough, muscle and back pains, loads of mucus and terrible laringitis(I literally cannot speak). \n\n3. About the shows. I knew of two shows that he insisted we watched together, and I didn't start those. This was a movie i started; I didn't know he wanted to watch it. He told me to stop it after I had already started it, so yeah. I wasn't even that mad about him leaving me home alone until he told me to stop the movie. So yeah, I didn't start the movie on purpose to 'punish' him. \n\n4. To the posters say that it could be covid. I haven't taken that into consideration until after he left. I know it's weird, but Covid hasn't been considered 'a thing' in my country for a while. I had three doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but not sure if that covers it anymore? Yeah, idk if it could really test positive to one of those home tests. I should ask him to get me one when he comes back tomorrow just in case. Or better yet, I should probably go to the hospital and get PCR tested. Y'all right, I've been irresponsabile.    At least I wore a mask at work \ud83e\udd14\n\n5.to the posters wondering if he took his parents up to their offer. He didn't. Said he's coming back tomorrow, as planned.\n\n6. To the commenters saying that I want to make him sick by staying at home with me. I'm pretty sure he's the one who gave me the cold. He was the first one showing symptoms, his are just way milder.(he just has a cough) i did tell him it might not be a good idea to go to his parents with it, but apparently they didn't care, they just wanted him to visit, so he went.\n\n7. What were my expectations for this christmas? Stay together on the couch and watch movies together, have a nice Christmas meal together. Idk, just chilling? as response to the people who say we would have stayed in separate rooms if he stayed for xmas) \n\n8. Why do my in laws hate me? Well, they're from a pretty conservative region in our country, and I'm a pretty liberal person(for once). They think i turned their son atheist(I didn't, he was that way when I met him) also they resent that my parents have a different religion than them?? My parents are born again christians, and my in laws are orthodox... Me and my husband are neither lmao. But yeah, i really tried to make them like me along the years with gifts and being generally nice, but it's not working i guess.\n\n8.Eh, idk, maybe I am the asshole, but I think relationships and the demands we have from them are very personal. In the end, if he had been in my place (in this exact situation) and I asked him to stay with me for Christmas.... i'm 99 percent sure I would have, so I think I want to be in a relationship with someone who would do the same for me.\n\nThanks for answering, everybody!\n\n\nSecond edit:  I talked to a friend who's an infectious disease doctor and I'm gonna get tested tomorrow. Based on the symptoms, he says it's most likely the flu.(since there's been a very aggresive flu brewing around in our city)\n\nThird edit: I feel some of y'all are taking this too seriously. \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\ude2c I'm not that hurt, it isn't that big of a deal, just a mild annoyance that we'll prolly forget about in a month. I just wrote the post because I wanted to gouge how someone outside the situation would see it. I've never used this subreddit before, but having seen this thread  I feel that it's very hard for someone on the internet's opinion to be that relevant in a situation like this since the context is usually very important, maybe some users have been through a similar situation and the story hits a nerve etc.  It's hard to discuss proper nuance and relationship history in a few paragraphs I guess. Anyway, it's really not that serious \ud83d\ude05\n\nFourth edit: Y'all keep calling them aging relatives \ud83d\ude2d they're in their mid 50s, so middle age I'd say, not elderly at all.\n\nFifth edit: lmao, just because last year I was ok with my husband leaving, it doesn't mean I'm ok with it this year when I'm actually housebound and I asked him to stay...?? Saw someone mentioning it. Just because i'm an atheist, doesn't mean I don't culturally care about Christmas.  It's a very important celebration in my country. It's a very nice holiday that I would rather spend with my loved ones than alone. My mum actually said the same thing: 'omg ur not even a christian, why do you even care that he's not home???' I personally don't care about baby Jesus, but I really like the holiday itself. Am I not allowed to enjoy the general festivities just because I'm not a Christian? \ud83d\ude05", "created_utc": 1703593671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r73pc/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stay_with_me_for/", "score": 1348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it still doesn\u2019t make him an AH for the original decision to go.", "NTA. It is not too much to ask your partner in life to miss 1 event. You are entitled to not wait to watch shows if he is not there. Everyone is doing what is best for them, except for you, so in the spirit of everyone doing what is best for themselves, you do what is best for yourself. \n\nIt is always interesting that people who treat others poorly, are always the first offended when those same people do what is best for them. \n\nYou have to let your husband understand that he should be uncomfortable with his parents if they do not stop actively trying to make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed in their home. You need to make him understand that you are not obligated to receive their hurtful actions whenever you are around them. You need to make him understand that YOU are not required to just accept their abuse, you are a person and no one, not anyone, can make you feel uncomfortable. No title in the world should be disrespectful to your spouse, mother, father, grandparent, aunt/uncle, Pope/ President, etc. \n\nMake him understand that he does not get the treatment that you do, and so he is being unfair to you by minimizing how hurt your feelings are that he doesn't properly defend you against these attacks from his parents. Again, his parents can feel however they feel, but your husband's job is to protect YOU from all attacks, from wherever it comes from. Make him understand that he is the reason why you are not going to his parents home for occasions because you are uncomfortable. He has the power to fix it, by letting his parents understand that he is YOUR protector, just like his father is his mother's protector, and HE will not let them disrespect HIS wife.\n\nThat is how you take control of your marriage. They choose to be hurtful and disrespectful, you choose to respond by not placing yourself in a situation that could be potentially hurtful for yourself. It is simply as easy as that. Make him understand that you deserve not to be hurt. Whatever he thought should happen, IS NOT HAPPENING anymore. If he thought that wives are supposed to just take whatever their MIL dishes out, he is mistaken and you are not that type of wife.

She was very very sick they day they were to leave.  5 hours in a car with her and he would have almost certainly gotten it.

But there are a few key factors here: \n\n- We're not Christian, and Christmas means zero to my husband. We spent Chanukah together very happily earlier this month, and our winter holiday is now over. I wouldn't have thought of traveling without him over our *actual* winter holiday, even though it's a fairly minor holiday in our religion (the big ones are spring and fall, as well as every Saturday). \n\n- When I began talking about coming to see my family at some point in December or January, he actually suggested flying over Christmas Day, because there's fewer people in the airports then. \n\n- Far from asking me not to go, he's actively looking forward to a quiet week or so to recharge by himself. We love each other, but both of us are introverts in a big and busy family, and we sometimes need a break from other humans; any other humans. \n\nSo I don't think the issue is that he \"left her alone over Christmas,\" as much as it is that he \"left her alone when it mattered deeply to her to be with him,\" whatever the reasons why it mattered so much to her. And yeah, that's plenty to make him, and not her, the AH. NTA.\n\nThis privilege can, like most marital privileges, be overused.

We were supposed to leave on 23rd of dec and come back on 27. \n\nAnyway, I realised on 22 that my cold was REALLY bad and that I couldn't leave with him. I actually asked him to stay with me instead (I didn't think it's a crime to miss Christmas at his folks for ONE year) but he insisted on going alone. \n\nI asked him multiple times to stay, but he just got me some meds and provisions and left. I've also asked him yesterday to return a day earlier, but he once again refused. \n\nAnyway, what really ticked me off is that I started watching a movie by myself (and he insisted that I close it and wait for him to return and watch it together--- and he also mentioned that with a tv show and another movie). It really pissed me off because I don't think he's in a position to make demands like that since he refused all my requests to not go/come back early.\n\nI also gotta mention that my MiL and FiL hate me and actually insisted that he stays there for a few more days. \n\nAITA?

Even though he isn't showing symptoms, he could still have it, and by going to his parents' house, he could risk infecting them. That aside, leaving your spouse alone on Christmas day is a pretty jerk move. I'd be livid if my husband left me alone and sick for around a week over Christmas. When we got married, I became his family, and he became mine, and when we had a kid together, our kid became a part of that new family that we formed. That family is my priority over the family I was born to. OP is NTA.", "But this is not about you and your circumstances? \nYou were devastated to miss time with your family over an important holiday because you were sick. Understandable.\nThat is the exact situation OP is in.", "A decade ago I had bad reflux (couldn't move without pain and every burp had vomit) THE ONLY REASON hubby left me alone that xmas day was because we had a toddler who wouldn't leave me alone and couldn't sit still so he kept our lunch plans just so that I could get some peace. If it wasn't the easiest way to keep our toddler from harrasing me he would have rathered stay with me and he texted every hour to check on me and when i didn't reply to two texts he called. I managed to get some sleep and was pissed he woke me but felt loved cause he was worried.\n\nIt's not the flu that's the issue here (although it is stupid, he risked passing it around), but the being left alone on any day while sick, let alone multiple days and over xmas. What if OP had gotten up to the toilet, fainted and hit her head, how long would it have taken him to notice, let alone get back to her or arrange someone to check on her.", "I hate to break it to you, but a cold IS an infectious disease.", "Please stay single.", "I guess the difference is you seem to think your partner has to prove that they really do need your support. I think the fact that they asked multiple times for their partner\u2019s support should be enough.", "Yes.", "If someone is hateful and purposefully hurtful to someone you love them why are you still spending and prioritizing time with them? You're cosigning bullying and abuse. If your spouse was black and your parents were racist would you still be cosigning racism because your parents are old and might die soon? \n\nI personally have a set or morals and values that would make it difficult to associate with and be okay with someone bullying and being hateful to my spouse. But, you do you and I suspect that if you go out into the \"dating pool\" and tell people that mommy will always come first, you'll be in the dating pool for a very long time. Which, honestly, is good since that attitude is pretty immature.", "I can't tell if you're being purposely obtuse. It has nothing to do with not being able to take care of herself and everything to do with being left alone on Christmas. It would be irresponsible for her to travel and infect everyone she comes into contact with. So she's made the right choice not to travel and infect her in-laws. Anyone who loved their partner would recognise how shitty it would feel to be left alone for 5 days over Christmas and would either go spend Xmas with family and then immediately head back home that evening or following morning and try to do something nice for their partner to make up for the misery of being sick and alone on Christmas or just stay home in the first place and rearrange a post Christmas Christmas trip to see the family as intended. Both of these options are 'rooted in reality ' and really should be the bare minimum expectation from your spouse. It has nothing to do with needing to be taken care of. It's weird that you keep trying to make it about that when it's not. It's about having basic levels of empathy that to be left all alone for several days over the festive period is really sad and lonely and it's selfish to put someone you love through that unnecessarily.", "What\u2019s selfish is he has the sniffles too and still visited his ageing parents. You may have skipped the COVID era 2-3yrs back so go figure why their sniffling son is eventually an ultimate asshole here not just by ditching the wife..", "Oops. That\u2019s a flaw if that\u2019s how it works.", "1. Is not about being helpless, is about caring.\n\n2. Why are you assuming they have to skip Christmas? Again, why do yall think Christmas is only celebrated a certain way? Like I mentioned, I traveled for the holidays, if my partner was sick I would\u2019ve stayed home , that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m skipping Christmas it just mean it will be celebrated differently.", "Getting married does not mean you *only* value your spouse. In a healthy relationship you will also continue to value other relationships and other activities.", "Do yall even like the people you marry? \ud83d\ude02", "She\u2019s been sick, so he already has her germs if they live together\u2026 I don\u2019t understand the whole \u201cwants him to suffer too\u201d\u2026 why is spending time with your spouse when they\u2019re sick \u201csuffering\u201d\u2026.they could have a nice time together and no one has to \u201csuffer\u201d or be \u201cmiserable\u201d", "Misery loves company but it doesn\u2019t NEED company most of the time. If my partner hadn\u2019t also been sick with covid I absolutely would have encouraged him to go and I didn\u2019t try to detract from the joy the rest of my healthy family was experiencing because I had to miss out.", "I didn\u2019t put words in your mouth. I asked a question. You reminded me that marriage vows are to be a partner in sickness and health.  Not sure what your point is.  So what is your point exactly?", "A cold is the flu usually. I also caught the flu thos year and I could barely walk the first day because my joints were so swollen and I was in so much pain. Now I'm just congested, but oof. 'just a cold' is what this whole pandemic was which lead people to be on respirators.", "You know what they mean.", "I\u2019m not really going to argue with someone that takes \u201chis parents hate me\u201d to \u201cthey bully and abuse me\u201d. I\u2019m also not going to argue with someone that compares a couple disliking someone to blatant racism. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that OP *themselves* was okay with going to spend four days with his parents. So if it was fine with her, it\u2019s fine to go without her.\n\nI love my parents, some of us have no reason to hate them, it is completely fine to have a separate relationship with your parents that your spouse doesn\u2019t share. People dislike each other sometimes, I\u2019m not going to disown my parents because they dislike my spouse. I\u2019m personally going to keep them separate and hope they both respect the time I want to spend with the other. \n\nMy partner of 15 years absolutely knows when it comes to death my parents will come first, so here\u2019s to hoping she always remains understanding and respectful! I also absolutely know to some people the love and care I show for my elderly parents would be a plus to them. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea, which is good because someone that can bail on their elderly parents is a huge red flag to me. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that OP is in an entirely different culture, I\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t mean much to an American with their \u201cme first\u201d characteristics but there are entire countries out there where parents go bankrupt sending their children to better schools because taking care of your elders when you\u2019re older is engrained within their culture. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d find a way to still judge OPs boyfriend if he was in such a culture.", "She\u2019s not concerned if he\u2019s bringing disease to his parents. She\u2019s mad he is visiting his parents when she has a head cold.", "And I'm looking at it from the angle that I would feel like an ass if my partner skipped out on a fun time with family so they can sit around on their own while I'm sleeping/recovering.\n\nI meant the planned family Christmas when I said skipping Christmas.", "And I didn't say only. I said more than.\n\nAs in I understand, and am upset, my parents may be sad I miss Christmas. However I am more upset my spouse may be sad if they are alone and sick on Christmas. I value my spouse's happiness more than my parent's or even my own.", "I love him because he would never expect me to stay with him in this situation. He would be the first one to say it\u2019s stupid for us to both miss out.", "Did we learn nothing from Covid? Just because one person in the family is sick doesn\u2019t make it inevitable that everyone else will too if you use common sense. Apparently he is at his parents\u2019 house having a grand time so it doesn\u2019t appear he is sick yet. If she is that sick she should be mostly sleeping anyway. I don\u2019t understand why you are insisting that he should enjoy being at home with someone who is sick versus being with his family he doesn\u2019t see very often. Maybe you would be happy to do so but it doesn\u2019t mean everyone else should or would.", "He's probably already sick!", "Yup.", "Yes. They mean \"my partner having an incredibly infectious disease that I am also probably carrying is no reason for me to miss my family's Christmas celebrations with my elderly parents whose immune systems are likely compromised.\"", "That makes him a double AH.", "And I would understand, that since I am with my husband the other 364 days of the year, if he wanted to spend a holiday with his parents while I stayed at home with a *cold* I wouldn't give him shit about it.", "Because he knows you wouldn\u2019t be upset..", "And just because you would be happy to be alone on Christmas doesn\u2019t mean everyone else would or should be\u2026 see how that works? You and your husband have it figured out and sounds like you\u2019d both be ok with that situation. Op isn\u2019t and therefore they should have found a compromise, like him coming home a bit early\u2026 why couldn\u2019t that have been done? lol", "\u2026.him not getting sick doesn\u2019t change the fact that he had already been exposed so that doesn\u2019t change anything i said.. ? Im not insisting he should prefer that to his parents Christmas, just that it shouldn\u2019t make him miserable to be with her when she doesn\u2019t feel well lol", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he is showing symptoms yet and he has been gone a while apparently. Maybe he was careful when he was home.", "lol, so no you don't know what they mean then.", "But that's not the situation here. He was asked to stay home. He did not because being with his parents was more important to him than being with his spouse. His parents, who are actually spouse's choosing to spend the holidays together while demanding other spouses do not.", "Not sure what that means lol", "I didn\u2019t say I would be happy. I would deal with it so my husband wouldn\u2019t miss out too. Sometimes things suck and we have to make the most of it. It doesn\u2019t look like OP was trying to negotiate at all. It sounds like she was a brat when he left anyway and that is why he is staying gone.", "Have you ever heard of limiting your exposure to germs? You must be a joy to live with. I am sick so everyone else drop everything and cater to my needs. You are going to get sick anyone so come wipe my nose lol.", "Please explain, if you would.", "She asked him to return one day earlier and he said no. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so set on her being a brat for not wanting to be alone for Christmas\u2026", "I don\u2019t why you are so set on not understanding why he wouldn\u2019t want to not see his family on Christmas. Either way I am bored and done with this conversation LOL", "You're welcome to ask someone if they'll wait for you to watch with them. But 1) you get to ask, and they get to say no if they choose to; and 2) you hadn't just turned down *their* request for spending time with them, and a more important one to most people at that. If he says no to her when she asks to spend Christmas together, she certainly gets to say no to him when he asks to spend Movie together.", "That actually happened to my father-in-law a few years ago! He fainted, hit his head on the kitchen counter, and broke his eye socket. All the trauma sent him into several widow maker heart attacks shortly after. Luckily, he was found fairly quickly.", "Bro what \ud83d\ude02 who said any of that? You sound unhinged"]}
