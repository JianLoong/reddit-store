{"id": 33780, "submission_id": "18r73pc", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to stay with me for Christmas instead of going to visit his parents?", "selftext": "I (31F) had a really, really bad cold this Christmas, I don't think I've had one like this ever since I was a kid. \n\nInitially I was supposed to go with my husband(32M) to go visit his parents that live 5 hours away. We were supposed to leave on 23rd of dec and come back on 27. \n\nAnyway, I realised on 22 that my cold was REALLY bad and that I couldn't leave with him. I actually asked him to stay with me instead (I didn't think it's a crime to miss Christmas at his folks for ONE year) but he insisted on going alone. \n\nI asked him multiple times to stay, but he just got me some meds and provisions and left. I've also asked him yesterday to return a day earlier, but he once again refused. \n\nAnyway, what really ticked me off is that I started watching a movie by myself (and he insisted that I close it and wait for him to return and watch it together--- and he also mentioned that with a tv show and another movie). It really pissed me off because I don't think he's in a position to make demands like that since he refused all my requests to not go/come back early.\n\nI also gotta mention that my MiL and FiL hate me and actually insisted that he stays there for a few more days. \n\nAITA? I dumno if i'm exagerrating a bit, I kinda feel that I am.\n\n\nEdit:Making this additional post because I can't comment because of lack of karma. \n\nWanted to give a bit more information on the issue. \n\n1.I'm from an Eastern European country, so I guess Christmas is pretty important for my in-laws. We usually go there together for Christmas. Last year I didn't go because I worked(but I didn't ask him to stay home with me ofc, so he went alone and I didn't mind it because I wasn't bedridden lmao. So it's not like it's a common occurence for me to beg him to spend Christmas with me. \n\n2.The commenters have a theory, and I agree. I do think he may have through I was exaggerating my cold in order to make him not go. Could be, especially since he knows that I don't feel comfortable visiting them. My husband is indeed an only child(as some commenters speculated), and my MiL does little to hide her distaste for me. She made a scene at our wedding and constantly makes disparaging remarks about me. Truth be told, I do think she's a hateful woman in general, she isn't that much nicer to my husband. My FiL is mostly passive aggresive and mocks me when we talk, but nothing as hateful as my MiL. So, I do suspect my husband thought I might be exaggerating in order to not go. However, I really am very sick. I barely made it through the last days at work. (because I couldn't take free time from work), so I basically collapsed in bed on the 22nd. I haven't left the house since. I have a fever, a really bad cough, muscle and back pains, loads of mucus and terrible laringitis(I literally cannot speak). \n\n3. About the shows. I knew of two shows that he insisted we watched together, and I didn't start those. This was a movie i started; I didn't know he wanted to watch it. He told me to stop it after I had already started it, so yeah. I wasn't even that mad about him leaving me home alone until he told me to stop the movie. So yeah, I didn't start the movie on purpose to 'punish' him. \n\n4. To the posters say that it could be covid. I haven't taken that into consideration until after he left. I know it's weird, but Covid hasn't been considered 'a thing' in my country for a while. I had three doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but not sure if that covers it anymore? Yeah, idk if it could really test positive to one of those home tests. I should ask him to get me one when he comes back tomorrow just in case. Or better yet, I should probably go to the hospital and get PCR tested. Y'all right, I've been irresponsabile.    At least I wore a mask at work \ud83e\udd14\n\n5.to the posters wondering if he took his parents up to their offer. He didn't. Said he's coming back tomorrow, as planned.\n\n6. To the commenters saying that I want to make him sick by staying at home with me. I'm pretty sure he's the one who gave me the cold. He was the first one showing symptoms, his are just way milder.(he just has a cough) i did tell him it might not be a good idea to go to his parents with it, but apparently they didn't care, they just wanted him to visit, so he went.\n\n7. What were my expectations for this christmas? Stay together on the couch and watch movies together, have a nice Christmas meal together. Idk, just chilling? as response to the people who say we would have stayed in separate rooms if he stayed for xmas) \n\n8. Why do my in laws hate me? Well, they're from a pretty conservative region in our country, and I'm a pretty liberal person(for once). They think i turned their son atheist(I didn't, he was that way when I met him) also they resent that my parents have a different religion than them?? My parents are born again christians, and my in laws are orthodox... Me and my husband are neither lmao. But yeah, i really tried to make them like me along the years with gifts and being generally nice, but it's not working i guess.\n\n8.Eh, idk, maybe I am the asshole, but I think relationships and the demands we have from them are very personal. In the end, if he had been in my place (in this exact situation) and I asked him to stay with me for Christmas.... i'm 99 percent sure I would have, so I think I want to be in a relationship with someone who would do the same for me.\n\nThanks for answering, everybody!\n\n\nSecond edit: I live in Romania. I talked to a friend who's an infectious disease doctor and I'm gonna get tested tomorrow. Based on the symptoms, he says it's most likely the flu.(since there's been a very aggresive flu brewing around in our city) ", "created_utc": 1703593671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r73pc/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stay_with_me_for/", "score": 1064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your husband probably sleep in the same bed and are frequently within 3 feet of each other (prime distance for droplet transmission).

He should\u2019ve made it a quick trip even if the drive is long. Him allowing his parents to convince him to stay isn\u2019t cool. But it still doesn\u2019t make him an AH for the original decision to go.", "NTA. It is not too much to ask your partner in life to miss 1 event. You are entitled to not wait to watch shows if he is not there. Everyone is doing what is best for them, except for you, so in the spirit of everyone doing what is best for themselves, you do what is best for yourself. \n\nIt is always interesting that people who treat others poorly, are always the first offended when those same people do what is best for them. \n\nYou have to let your husband understand that he should be uncomfortable with his parents if they do not stop actively trying to make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed in their home. You need to make him understand that you are not obligated to receive their hurtful actions whenever you are around them. You need to make him understand that YOU are not required to just accept their abuse, you are a person and no one, not anyone, can make you feel uncomfortable. No title in the world should be disrespectful to your spouse, mother, father, grandparent, aunt/uncle, Pope/ President, etc. \n\nMake him understand that he does not get the treatment that you do, and so he is being unfair to you by minimizing how hurt your feelings are that he doesn't properly defend you against these attacks from his parents. Again, his parents can feel however they feel, but your husband's job is to protect YOU from all attacks, from wherever it comes from. Make him understand that he is the reason why you are not going to his parents home for occasions because you are uncomfortable. He has the power to fix it, by letting his parents understand that he is YOUR protector, just like his father is his mother's protector, and HE will not let them disrespect HIS wife.\n\nThat is how you take control of your marriage. They choose to be hurtful and disrespectful, you choose to respond by not placing yourself in a situation that could be potentially hurtful for yourself. It is simply as easy as that. Make him understand that you deserve not to be hurt. Whatever he thought should happen, IS NOT HAPPENING anymore. If he thought that wives are supposed to just take whatever their MIL dishes out, he is mistaken and you are not that type of wife. So, he has a decision to make, make them respect the choice you made in a wife and they will have to respect you and his decision.", "YTA here. I have the same horrible cold that you do and it SUCKS. But I wasn't going to inflict it on my friends and family and I would never expect someone else, even my SO/partner, to give up their Christmas to sit home and be miserable with me.

There are also a million things on tv and cable right now-you could actually view this as a nice thing that he wants you to wait to watch a film until you can see it together, but that doesn't fit OP's narrative.\n\nOnly OP knows if she's exaggerating 'a bit' but I'm going with yeah, you sure are. Throwing in the 'MiL and FiL hate me' at the end of the post to push harder for the 'poor me' vote confirms it for me.", "NTA.

It could be RSV, it could be COVID.  Even if it is only a cold, she's contagious.  You are contagious for the entire time you have symptoms.  She was very very sick they day they were to leave.  5 hours in a car with her and he would have almost certainly gotten it.

Pay attention.", "Well, I have to acknowledge that I'm writing this from my parents' house, where I'm visiting for a week without my husband. But there are a few key factors here: \n\n- We're not Christian, and Christmas means zero to my husband. We spent Chanukah together very happily earlier this month, and our winter holiday is now over. I wouldn't have thought of traveling without him over our *actual* winter holiday, even though it's a fairly minor holiday in our religion (the big ones are spring and fall, as well as every Saturday). \n\n- When I began talking about coming to see my family at some point in December or January, he actually suggested flying over Christmas Day, because there's fewer people in the airports then. \n\n- Far from asking me not to go, he's actively looking forward to a quiet week or so to recharge by himself. We love each other, but both of us are introverts in a big and busy family, and we sometimes need a break from other humans; any other humans. \n\nSo I don't think the issue is that he \"left her alone over Christmas,\" as much as it is that he \"left her alone when it mattered deeply to her to be with him,\" whatever the reasons why it mattered so much to her. And yeah, that's plenty to make him, and not her, the AH. \n\nThis privilege can, like most marital privileges, be overused. The person who *keeps* coming up with reasons why they cannot possibly be left alone right then, every time their partner attempts to go spend any time with somebody else, needs to be reminded that a partner is not a pacifier. But simply asking for him to be with her over a major family holiday when she is also sick in bed is not anywhere close to misusing the privilege.", "NTA", "YTA.
