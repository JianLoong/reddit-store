When he came out he had to check in with probation regularly. \n\nAt the probation office, he met a girl, \"Lizzie\" (21) and they hit it off. She'd just come out after a year inside. Her family are very well off, but they kicked her out so she was living in a hostel. She was only there temporarily and had nowhere to go after that, so with my permission Steven offered her to come and stay with us. \n\nWhen Lizzie first moved in it was tough for her. She's used to quite a comfortable lifestyle and was hoping to return to one when she came out, but she settled in quickly. \n\nI gave Steven one more chance after he came home, and fair to him, he's managed to get a job labouring on a building site. \n\nLizzie however has refused to get a job. Before she got arrested she was studying for a degree, and sees jobs like cleaning or admin work as beneath her. She's trying to find an entry-level job in the field she was studying, but has had no success. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem, as even with me and Steven working, we only just make enough to cover the rent, food and bills. More than once we've had to go days without hot water. \n\nLizzie became pregnant a few months back and decided to keep the baby, which Steven is fully supporting. I'm happy for them, but this will give us another mouth to feed. I said that as soon as the baby is born (if both mother and baby are healthy of course), I expect Lizzie to take any job available. I work as a cleaner in evenings and nights so am around in the daytime to take care of the baby while Stephen and Lizzie work. \n\nI told them that if Lizzie refuses, they can look for a place of their own. \n\nThis made Lizzie cry, and say she doesn't want to do a \"soul destroying\" job because she used to have a bright future ahead of her. I understand this and it's unfortunate, but I've worked shitty jobs all my life, and this building site job is the first Stephen ever had. Living where we do, shitty jobs are a part of life, and we won't be able to provide her baby with a comfortable home if she doesn't get one. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694265976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e5r6t/aita_for_telling_my_sons_pregnant_girlfriend_to/", "score": 1258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So many people want kids, want a big family but are too poor to support it. Theres been an 'its my right to have kids and have the state pay because i refuse to get a job!' Mentality. People think cleaning/admin/fast food jobs are beneath them but if scrubbing toilets meant i had food and a roof over my head id be snatching that job up and be grateful i was getting paid\n\nEta sorry rant over", "None of these replies come anywhere close to addressing the core of my comment. Most people and by most, I mean like 80% of the world never reaches the level to where food isn't a scarcity. If you're of the opinion that they shouldn't have children because of that, then there's honestly no saving you and your morality. \n\nYou're essentially proposing that morally only the top ~20% of people in the world should have kids while the other ~80% become indentured servants to their offspring by only working to benefit the wealthy elite's children's future because the poor individuals would have no one to leave a better world to even if they did manage to create one through their work. So in this situation, they'd only be working to make a better world for their oppressors to live in when the poor people die off.", "Good point. It seems like Lizzie should be looking for wfh stuff-- transcribing or that sort of thing. Seems like she might have the aptitude for it if she's done well in uni for a couple years. I wonder if OP hasn't thought of that?\n\nOP seems caring, and I feel bad for them. I don't think it's reasonable for OP to care for the baby while Lizzie works. My vote is working from home.", "nope. Not at all", "I don't know why this stuff hasn't been mentioned in the OP. If she's not working and not living with her parents, then *at the very least* she should be on food stamps. \n\nAs for the shit jobs, that's what's happening with everyone just out of school anyway. Get a crap job now and keep trying; hopefully the market will correct before they're at retirement age. It sucks, but she's not alone.", "Going by the spelling in OP, I'm assuming she isn't in the US.", "Who is this 'someone' who decided to ruin her future? It was her choice to break the law and then have a baby while in no position to financially support it. Getting pregnant is something billions of humans have already done along with many billions of animals on this planet and absolutely does not make you special. She doesn't 'deserve' to be taken care of, she's a grown adult who made adult decisions that she is now responsible for and refuses to accept that responsibility", "I dunno according to everyone around me I'd make a great father. But I have no interest in having kids after being around them my entire childhood when my mom did daycare.", "Why not give the ultimatum of returning to school as opposed to taking a crappy job? In the long term, this is a much better solution for everyone involved.", "I prefer to leave people some agency over their lives. Of course this child will have the odds against it becoming someone of the 1%... or even 10%. But that doesn't mean they will be a bad person.", "\"Woman\" is generous. This is a freeloading, immature, irresponsible girl we are talking about.", "The mother is NOT POOR.\n\nSHE IS UNWILLING TO WORK. \n\nVast difference.", "Umm yes, why do you want a baby be subjected to starving and homelessness? Plus considering the situation, the baby may also be struggling during adulthood which they haven't agreed to.", "No having children if you can't take care of them. What kind of life is that for the child?", "Abortion or adoption.", "My comment was directed at OP being \"happy\" that two woefully ill equipped young people are having a baby and thus ensuring almost certainly a cycle of continuing poverty and stunted lives.\n\nAnd also directly in response to someone saying that most people live paycheck to paycheck in dire circumstances.\n\nThe reality is that people who actually plan their futures in some way do NOT have a life of minimum wage jobs and limited mobility. While not everyone can be Horatio Alger, there are ways that help one help oneself - community college; apprenticeships. \n\nAnd yeah - birth control because having a child at 19 or 20 or even early 20's with limited education and job prospects is almost certainly going to mean a lifetime of poverty absent extraordinary circumstances.", "39% - which is far, far too high anyway - worldwide can't afford a healthy nutritious diet. 10% go to bed hungry. Vote for policies that narrow the gap", "Weird take.\n\nMake sure you are able to take responsibility for yourself before bringing in a small baby totally dependant on you to also have responsibility for.\n\n\"Oh, I am homeless! And dont have enough food! But I have a right to have a child so it is ok if my baby starves and freezes on the street.\"", ">So in this situation, they'd only be working to make a better world for their oppressors\n\nOr just for themselves?

I'd never kick one of them out because of some pregnancy.", "Telling someone that they have to have an abortion or be kicked out is not good fathering.", "It is, for the long term. OP said they're barely getting by as it is, though. Can they survive until long term with a baby in the house? They'll need some serious public assistance or something; babies are very expensive.", "Because school isn't free, and if her parents are well off Lizzie probably doesnt qualify for assistance.\n\nLizzie needs to go to her parents, lay out her options (return to school with their help so she can provide better for baby, get a shit job and put her nose to the grindstone, etc) and see if the baby changes things for her parents.\n\nMy parents are upper middle class and firmly believe in helping people who help themselves. If I were Lizzie snd had made a mess of things so far theyd have done what her parents did and let me face the consequences of my actions. If I came to them with a solid plan, proof Id been making actual steps in the right direction, and that I clearly needed help, Id likely get some advice and some support. Contingent upon hard but achievable goals and work.\n\nLizzie needs to get real and start showing up for her life.", "Maybe it is, depending on what she is studying, whether she stays out of trouble, and whether she has an actual work ethic.  But they can't afford that at all right now, so it's kind of a moot point.", "Where is the money for that going to come from?", "I didn\u2019t say they\u2019d be bad but I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m ever going to celebrate a human being born into such obviously awful circumstances.", "They're alive. I assume the kid wouldn't starve to death. What is taking care of them to you? They have the new iPhone as soon as they turn 12?

I can think of a man that had a funny mustache that would agree with a lot of what the people in this comment section are advocating for.", "Exactly. Study after study has proven that \"tough love\" doesn't work in the long term.", "Hey, we have (almost) the same hat! Just the pom pom is a different colour", "That's exactly my point. Childcare alone would cost more than she'd ever make at a menial job. She'd financially be better off watching the baby at home,  taking online courses/night classes, and dig themselves out of this mess.", "Don't feed the troll their name is let them eat cake.", "I think you've made a lot of assumptions about Lizzie and her family based on a single reddit post and your seemingly healthy and loving upbringing. I'm not being snide, and I hope, for her sake, that she has this option.\n\nIf not, her parents should not be claiming her as a dependent anymore, and school loans should be available to her. \n\nOP, wishing the best for you and your family.", "If they're poor, she will either have school paid for, or can take out student loans to cover school and some living expenses, which will contribute to the household.", "Literally you are overreaching. No one is suggesting that, rather just waiting until they can provide for their child. Keep in mind that the son\u2019s gf literally wants to get a better job and it could help if she waited to get a degree and a job like she wants to try and escape poverty while you are suggesting she submit her fate and accept poverty forever. Getting a kid will literally hurt her chances significantly when she can just wait for 4-5 years. They are 19 and 21 they got so much time lol. Apparently being logical to you is the same as being a nazi?", "OP has to provide housing and food because the kids can't even manage their finances to support their own lives.\n\nBut yeah, everyone here means iPhones and avocado toast and not, you know, basic life necessities that this soon-to-be-parents will not be able to provide their kid.\n\nBut hey, if they have a refrigerator box to live in and some captured rain water in an old tin can they are getting by just fine, right?", "It says in the post that OP can watch the baby during the day bc they work nights", "If they\u2019re in the US, school would most definitely not be paid for.

However much sympathy I may have for their economic situation, that situation is a result of their own poor choices previously. Now they\u2019re shelling out kids, the rest of us can pay for them as well. \n\nHaving kids requires self sacrifice.
