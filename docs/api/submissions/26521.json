When he came out he had to check in with probation regularly. \n\nAt the probation office, he met a girl, \"Lizzie\" (21) and they hit it off. She'd just come out after a year inside. Her family are very well off, but they kicked her out so she was living in a hostel. She was only there temporarily and had nowhere to go after that, so with my permission Steven offered her to come and stay with us. \n\nWhen Lizzie first moved in it was tough for her. She's used to quite a comfortable lifestyle and was hoping to return to one when she came out, but she settled in quickly. \n\nI gave Steven one more chance after he came home, and fair to him, he's managed to get a job labouring on a building site. \n\nLizzie however has refused to get a job. Before she got arrested she was studying for a degree, and sees jobs like cleaning or admin work as beneath her. She's trying to find an entry-level job in the field she was studying, but has had no success. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem, as even with me and Steven working, we only just make enough to cover the rent, food and bills. More than once we've had to go days without hot water. \n\nLizzie became pregnant a few months back and decided to keep the baby, which Steven is fully supporting. I'm happy for them, but this will give us another mouth to feed. I said that as soon as the baby is born (if both mother and baby are healthy of course), I expect Lizzie to take any job available. I work as a cleaner in evenings and nights so am around in the daytime to take care of the baby while Stephen and Lizzie work. \n\nI told them that if Lizzie refuses, they can look for a place of their own. \n\nThis made Lizzie cry, and say she doesn't want to do a \"soul destroying\" job because she used to have a bright future ahead of her. I understand this and it's unfortunate, but I've worked shitty jobs all my life, and this building site job is the first Stephen ever had. Living where we do, shitty jobs are a part of life, and we won't be able to provide her baby with a comfortable home if she doesn't get one. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694265976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e5r6t/aita_for_telling_my_sons_pregnant_girlfriend_to/", "score": 4298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants a comfortable life, then she needs to get her shit together and move back in with her parents.", "You\u2019re horrible.", "NTA\n\nYou don't say what Lizzie did to be sent in jail, but she had a year to realize her comfortable lifestyle and getting a degree backed up by wealthy parents, is over. \n\nI don't know how to make her see the reality that there's only Stephen and you between her and the street. She's better learn th\u00e9 rules of that new life real quick, but chances are she won't.", "NTA you have one of those \"soul crushing jobs\". You don't owe her to pay for them and the baby. They are both adults.\nFact is, you have trouble paying for everything, so they need to pay for their part of the rent, utilities and food.\n\nI fully understand not staying at a job you hate, but she has a lot of options. Cleaning, restaurants, retails, factory work, etc.\n\nPS I hope you're not literal with \" as soon as the baby is born\". That's an American thing and every single other country is smarter than that. A mother needs at the very least a month to recover from child birth and the first few months are important for both parents to bond with the baby. She can work on her resume, send it to places and do interviews, but expecting her to work a few days after giving birth would be stupid", "NTA. Reasonable boundary.", "NTA - Lizzie sounds spoilt and entitled. She\u2019s going to have to pull her weight to contribute financially, even if she\u2019s forced to take \u2018shitty\u2019 jobs in the meantime", "\"Lizzie\" wrecked her own bright future. She is in no position to be making selfish demands. You were more than kind allowing her to live with you, but if you're already stretched, I'd kick her out. She can go snivelling and grovelling back to her own parents. I know you're the future grandmother of her baby, but honestly, it's not your job to feed her ungrateful mouth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "As soon as the baby is born? So, uh, who will take care of the baby when she\u2019s working? No offense but a nanny is very expensive. Maybe have her wait until the babe can go to day care and stuff?\n\nNta but also kind of?", "I think you're going way too above and beyond, especially with Lizzie, but NTA.", "NTA If she doesn't want to do a soul destroying job she should rethink continuing the pregnancy. If it's not too late to terminate, she could go back to school or look into other career options. If she has the baby she and your son will be stuck supporting it and will have to work crappy jobs whether they want to or not.", "Your 19 year old son had one chance to clean up? No offense but how is a 19 year old been screwing up, adulthood has been one year, if he was a minor it\u2019s probably easier for ppl to over look than a  legal adult. Not to mention what is allowed on records. Honestly you should take a bit of accountability if he was that bad before being an adult and if it was a brief period  then don\u2019t act like he\u2019s a fuck up. Something about this makes me wonder if there is a genuine time line or if this is for rage baiting. Honestly she should get a job when she can not immediately after having a child, and I hope they all get better ofc. As for child care it\u2019s expensive and family seems to be fair weathered she\u2019d have more luck getting assistance than paying for stuff with her job, doesn\u2019t make it right it\u2019s the reality tho. I hope she does find a job in her field and continues. Idk why that\u2019s some kind of snarky thing she\u2019s probably going to peruse it anyways and at least it will actually support a kid.", "NTA. She should get a job now. Why can\u2019t she work while pregnant?", ">Lizzie became pregnant a few months back and decided to keep the baby, which Steven is fully supporting\n\nWell then.... that's their decision as a couple. Now it's time to step up!!\n\n>This made Lizzie cry, and say she doesn't want to do a \"soul destroying\" job because she used to have a bright future ahead of her. \n\nWelll.... I dunno what she did to have to go to jail for a year, but she should know by now that causes have consequences and she has to deal with them and, again, step up! \n\nShe can't expect you to care for three people, F that!\n\nOP, as much as you love your son, it is time to cut the cord! You can't spend another 20 years trying to live for another mouth to feed! There are three adults here, two of them young and spry who are about to become parents!\n\nThey need to step up for their sake\n\nNTA", "NTA - she needs to get out of her imaginary world and into the reality. What would she have done, if your son was not in the picture. She would have had to work to feed herself right.\n\nIt is better to work rather than expecting others to feed her for free. How is she ok to sit at home at this age not doing anything ?", "They both need jobs and thier own place. They need a space to grow in thier relationship without parents around, and need to learn how to raise a family together in thier own space.\n\nMark my words, if you dont do this now in ten years they will still be in the same boat depending on you. I see it all the time in my job, and this is exactly why my sister is still at my parents place with 2 kids (she has a good job tho) and why my brother and his wife jumped from my parents house to her parents house to her brothers house (with kids).\n\nIf you dont take the training wheels of then they will never learn to balance while riding a bike. If you dont take the saftey net away then they will either arbitrarily quit jobs, bouncing from job to job with long periods of unemployment; or they will keep thier jobs but spend all thier cash on clothes and nicer cars than they can afford etc becasue why not, they have a free place.\n\nLet them out on thier own, check in once in a while to make sure the kid is ok. Or dont and in ten years this will be how it is, and you will be more of a parent to thier kids then they are instead of just being grandmom", "NTA\n\nBut....\nLet's be realistic.\n\nLizzie, very likely, isn't going to be able to bring in money.\nI mean, regardless of where she works, the childcare will cost more than she's likely to get paid.\n\nLizzie is also going to find out that being a SAHM is harder than any job she will find. There is nothing more soul crushing that being broke and isolated with a baby.\nBut this would be the cheaper option and, in some state, there are still some state benefits for people in that position.", "INFO: is Lizzie currently in school or does she have plans to finish her degree? Also, how realistic is it that she can get a job in her field without a degree and having been to juvie? What is the approximate difference in the pay for the type of job in her field vs the job you\u2019re telling her to get?", "NTA, I got a job when I was 7 months pregnant & worked right up until I went into labour (at work lol) , returned 2 months after. I\u2019m sure she figure something out.", "Why wouldn't someone be happy their son is having a kid and giving them a grandchild? That's a joyus thing, even if there are negative practicalities.\nIf that's your only takeaway from this then you need to work on yourself, not question others.", "Why is she happy? Because it doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances all life is valuable and precious - how disgusting of you to even ask that.", "Well hold on, there is an option where she applies for all the city/county/state programs like EBT and WIC, scours buy nothing groups on Facebook for supplies and diapers and gets a part time work from home job, like one of those translating/proofreading services.", ">NTA but why are you happy for them having a baby?\n\nYeah, I wouldn't be and I'd tear them a new one! But I'd still reiterate that I don't have any say in it and it's their choice, which they will have to deal with by themselves!\n\nI'd help them look for ways to get housing etc, would help with some babysitting and all but I would not let them stay in my home\n\nEdit: I dunno about her relationship with Steven, but I feel she misses that comfy life more than anything! Therefore I won't be surprised if she gets in touch with her parents and they decide to give her another chance with the condition of an abortion so she can start fresh etc\n\nAnd she will do it, for sure\n\nFor this, I feel for Steven", "She was already a deadbeat expecting others to support her way through life before she got knocked up.", "How are they treating her like an incubator?", "My ex's parents let me move in with them right after high school, because my dad threw a laptop at me. It was very kind of them, and they did have me get a job and help take care of their horses every day. Saying 'I never understand people letting their kids SOs move in so cavalierly' - that's kinda small-thinking. Most people talk to the person moving in so that they know what they expect from them living there.", "Especially since her family is rich, they probably shelled out for a good lawyer and got a lighter sentence than somebody middle or lower class.", "Or \u201cI want a grandbaby!!!\u201d", "To be honest, she probably baby trapped OPs son in order to secure herself housing, and thought that if she had a baby to stay home and take care of, then OP would get off her back about getting a job. She'd be a kept woman, and back to her privileged life.\n\n\n\nShe was wrong, but that was probably her line of thinking.", "I was wondering where the start work now comment was, if this is real. (I\u2019m suspicious as to how one year of adulthood has gone from wrap sheet to cleaned up to kid on the way unless op wants to forget she was in charge prior to this one year) sounds like she wants a reason to kick her out and have the baby stay kinda, why have her wait until she has no sleep to go look for a job and has to pump I hope she goes back to her family and finishes her schooling.op has made every comment about her make her out to be some lazy free loader when for all I know she\u2019s living with insane people who make her do their chores or has no way to leave the house.", "She was a student", "So you had extenuating circumstances then. Did you read my post?", "Their mom was quite privileged to do so.\n\n\n\nNot everyone can breastfeed, for a multitude of reasons, ranging from inability to make enough milk, needing meds, previous sexual assault, to poverty. \n\n\n\nHow lovely that your grandkids got to be breastfed.\n\n\n\nHowever, FED is best.", "'and moving out ASAP' - yes, I did read. :) I stand by what I said. It wasn't really extenuating circumstances, I would have lived if I stayed at my dads.", "Honestly, every 16 year old should have a part time or summer job. Fast food, supermarket, call centre, gardening etc etc.\n\nIt teaches you the importance of showing up for your team and getting the job done. It makes you appreciate the hard work of physical labour.\n\nAnd nothing makes you appreciate opportunities more.", "And also cleaning is beneath her but not beneath OP to have to do that to support her while she sits around watching Netflix.  I'm surprised OP allowed her in the house at all, this was not good thinking.", ">Funny how she's too self important to clean toilets but not too much that she wouldn't get herself involved in criminal activities.\n\nOh my god, yes!", "That's kind of a privileged pov.\n\n\n\nOP says even *with* son's job they have the hot water shut off some days.\n\n\nMeaning OP can't afford her *own* bills on her *own* income.\n\n\n\nPoverty is like that.\n\n\n\nShe actually needs them as much as they need her.", "Yes\n\nI'd offer to help with some guidance at adulting and babysitting, if they keep their noses clean!
