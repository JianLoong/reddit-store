It was a late night concert which lasted several hours. Next to me, between me and the end of the row, sat a couple with four kids. The youngest one was probably 3-4-year old and the eldest was probably preschool or 1st grade aged. From the get-go the concert seemed to be way too much for the kids as they squirmed and complained (although very quietly, props for the parents). They also complained several times that the music was too loud or scary. The seats were constantly shaking as they rocked back and forth or climbed their parents. They also crawled back and forth the footspace of the fifty-ish seat row. Before the intermission the kids were so frustrated that the parents had to physically hold two of them to stop them from running away, but there still was an occasional limb blocking my view to the stage or nudging me as the kids managed to squirm themselves nearly upside down in their parent\u2019s hold. I tried to gesture them once that i\u2019m not okay with this, but they gave me a shrug.\n\nI thought about leaving during the intermission because i had missed most of the concert so far, but then selfisly hoped that the family would leave during the intermission, but no, they came back.

After about ten minutes to the second part i noticed from the smell that the youngest one sitting on their fathers lap next to me needed their diaper to be changed. After a moment the parent begun reacting. The parents had their hands full with keeping the kids physically under control as they were still just as active as before. The father next to me could not hold the squirming kid still by themselves so he whispered to me if i could take the kid and hold him and they would change the diaper. I apologized and declined as i just wanted to concentrate on the music, but told them there is a child changing station just outside the hall. This pissed the father, but they managed to change the diaper without leaving their places.\n\nWhen the concert ended several (older) persons on the row behind and in front of me begun loudly berating me for several minutes for being an asshole and not helping with the diaper episode and the kids in general.

People have completely lost any semblance of manners and sanity.

I am ashamed of my own middle aged generation but old people are the absolute worst.

It\u2019s beyond disgusting and rude to inflict that smell on people who are trying to mind their own business and watch an event.\n\nNot to mention, disgustingly unsanitary. If there\u2019s a baby changing space available, there\u2019s no excuse for not using it in that scenario, or at least not doing it right there in the damn row. \n\nAs for holding their kid\u2026 just no. It takes a village, but that village is supposed to be populated by people who actually want to be part of the village, not whichever random bystanders are closest and can be forced to join the village.

That is incredibly inappropriate and, potentially, unsanitary.", "My thoughts exactly! Actually, it was more like \"EWWWWW!\"", "Ah, this could be it! Thank you!", "Thanks, this was my thought aswell. There was a restroom with nappy changing board (is that what it is called) just outside the hall (although the walk is rather long). The parent sitting at the edge of the row could\u2019ve taken the kid there and security would have let them back in between pieces.

No. I'm not touching stranger's kids. People need to stop bringing children to places where they can not handle their kids. NTA. They changed a kid on the seat. What gross behavior. They should have been kicked out.", "NTA. I would have complained and requested a refund.", "You showed a lot of fortitude for staying. I honestly think I'd have left. No way on earth I'd help some total stranger change his kid's poopy diaper in the seats. There are valid reasons people are legally required to take care of bodily functions in the restroom and changing area. They should have been kicked out. I like kids, but the distraction and noise and then the coup de gras of the diaper right next to me would just be too much.\n\n'", "NTA", "NTA\n\nPerhaps the people behind thought you were part of the family? \n\nIf it was my child, No i'd be taking the little one to the change station.", "NTA, coming from a parent of 3 kids.

They most likely would be kicked out for that.", "NTA. I would have been livid if I were you!! First of all, if your kids can\u2019t behave for an event like this, don\u2019t take them. My 4yo could never sit through something like this, so we don\u2019t take her (aside from the \u201cfamily day\u201d our local philharmonic does once a year).

The parents on the other hand, definitely.", "NTA. Some people shouldn\u2019t have kids. Two examples right here.", "NTA. This is revolting behaviour from the parents on so many levels, not least being changing a diaper in the middle of a performance. If you can\u2019t stop your children from interfering with the enjoyment of others during a performance, you shouldn\u2019t be there. You should especially not expect strangers to help with your children.", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom of a 4 year old and another coming very very soon. There\u2019s these wonderful things called babysitters and they should have hired 1 or 2 and left their children at home. That\u2019s far too young to expect small kids to stay still and pay attention.\n\nI took my oldest to the movies starting at 3. Kids movies. Where people expect small children to blurt out random things at funny parts and the movie isn\u2019t longer than 2 hours. Granted my kid is very quiet and well behaved besides playing musical chairs between her dad and me but we sit at the very back and would have left if it was too much for her. \n\nThose parents were wildly inappropriate and who tf asks a stranger to help change their child\u2019s diaper?? Especially IN the audience. I\u2019m a mom and I would have literally snapped at these people for their lack of manors and common sense.", "NTA.  These people are cretins.", "NTA. I would have made it maybe ten minutes before getting an usher to ask them to leave. It's fine for parents to try taking their kids to an event like this, but they need to recognize when their plan has failed.", "This is wildly inappropriate behavior on their part. I have 3 kids. I would never, ever ask a stranger in a concert I was interrupting to hold my child!! That\u2019s so weird! \n\nFor future reference a lot of theaters have ushers who you can speak to if they are being very loud and disruptive."]}
