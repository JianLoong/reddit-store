The youngest one was probably 3-4-year old and the eldest was probably preschool or 1st grade aged.

They also crawled back and forth the footspace of the fifty-ish seat row. Before the intermission the kids were so frustrated that the parents had to physically hold two of them to stop them from running away, but there still was an occasional limb blocking my view to the stage or nudging me as the kids managed to squirm themselves nearly upside down in their parent\u2019s hold.

After a moment the parent begun reacting. The parents had their hands full with keeping the kids physically under control as they were still just as active as before. The father next to me could not hold the squirming kid still by themselves so he whispered to me if i could take the kid and hold him and they would change the diaper. I apologized and declined as i just wanted to concentrate on the music, but told them there is a child changing station just outside the hall. This pissed the father, but they managed to change the diaper without leaving their places.\n\nWhen the concert ended several (older) persons on the row behind and in front of me begun loudly berating me for several minutes for being an asshole and not helping with the diaper episode and the kids in general.

People have completely lost any semblance of manners and sanity. Having four small children at a classical concert and changing a diaper right there\u2026 I would have left five minutes in, it never gets better in my experience. I have seen all sorts of things but a poopy diaper tops it all.\n\nWhere I live some theaters have had to institute orderlies who go around with lasers which they point at people who are talking, using their phone (yes, they even take calls right there), unruly children\u2026 One thing I have noticed is that it is NEVER teenagers and young people causing a disturbance. I am ashamed of my own middle aged generation but old people are the absolute worst. One old woman gave an excuse that she was trying to whisper but she got carried away and started talking loudly - you are not supposed to be whispering either, you old bat.
