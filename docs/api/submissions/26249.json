This is a Power play and it only eats away at your sister because he successfully got into her head with the belittling and gaslighting.

Hopefully she will now block him as she might be vulnerable to manipulation if lonely abroad.", ">He told her she had to thank him for making her into the woman she is.\n\nlol. Carlos is a sociopath and a narcissist. YNTA. Your sister feels bad because he has groomed and treated her in a way that makes her feel guilty for things she shouldn't when it comes to him. He has treated her poorly and kept her to the side for years but still worries about hurting HIS feelings. YNTA, it was the right thing, keep her away from him and with time she will start to realize how insane it all was.", "NTA. Well done for helping your sister see she is being manipulated by this man. Everyone needs a sister like you.", "NTA.  It sounds like you are being the support Jane needs.  Carlos, on the other hand, can go jump in many lakes.", "Carlos is TA and Jane sounds nice, and she should continue to block him, move to the other country, and enjoy her life without ever thinking of him again!", "NTA, your sis needs you and sounds like you are doing a great job.

You're literally telling someone to break the law. Ty has rights and obligations, the biological father has neither. Because Ty is on the birth certificate and that's what counts.", "Of course you're NTA. Thankfully Jane is moving abroad, and will be far away from this manipulative person. get her to stay strong for a little while longer. It will be much easier when she has miles between them", "That's what I'm afraid of, tbh... right now, she's feeling better, but I know how deep in her head he is, I just hope she remembers she's worth so much more.", "He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder about a year ago. It explains a lot, but it sucks to see her hurt like this because she knows how messed up it is, but until two weeks ago, couldn't get rid of him. I feel like I'm not helping at all, especially since I've been quite harsh in pointing out how much of an A he is, but I can't stand it anymore... Hopefully being away will help her.", "sorry, I think you commented on the wrong post, this has nothing to do with paternity ^^\"", "It is incredibly frustrating. I spent 30+ years prosecuting and so much of it was domestic violence. The laws evolved over that time to try and combat it ( making rape within marriage illegal, making controlling & coercive behaviour a crime, restraining orders etc.) but time and time again the issue we had was victims going back, withdrawing their statements, contacting their abusers and inviting them to DV shelters, asking for ROs to be lifted....The public never sees the work put into these cases by police, prosecution, probation DV workers and the endless hearbreak.\\*\n\nI've had it also in my family life - two aunts -who despite the complete support of their families and their parish priests for leaving insisted on staying with abusive husbands. One of those husbands is now dying and my aunt bizarrely imagines we're all as upset as she is...Most of their children will attend the funeral just to be sure which grave to piss on...\n\nWhat I am saying is support her but never support their relationship - and try and keep yourself somewhat emotionally detatched.( If you suspect he's contacting her abroad - might be an idea for you and yours to keep an eye on what he's doing - If he's telling her he's pining - but you have the evidence he's been out every night with different women....)\n\n\\*(One case that really upset me - the woman had made multiple complaints of DV, all withdrawn but we, her family and the police had finally managed to get a complaint to stick because we were all scared for her and achieved a restraining order. The police also installed an alarm. It was working - he stayed away from her , never breached the order. Then she found out he was in a new relationship....and started pestering him until he agreed to dump the new girl and go out with her. Second date they were walking back to her home he lost it and killed her.)", "I can only imagine how hard it must have been all these years, fighting for victims and seeing them getting reeled back in.\nI'm sorry about your aunt too, unfortunately, it's like it's so deeply ingrained in them to care for their abusers that they can forget/bypass all the hurt just to comfort them. I've been seeing this with my sister and Carlos, and I've told her she's projecting her feelings onto him when he's not really going through any of what she thinks he is.\n\nThat case about the woman being killed is horrifying and so so sad, that she was such a prisoner of her feelings for him that she wound up going back only to die..."]}
