After she announced her (unplanned) pregnancy 2 years ago i told her from the start that i would not be helping her take care of her child and she said she was fine with it.\n\nMy sister has always been an irresponsible person that often only thinks about her well-being and what she wants and doesn\u2019t take other peoples feelings or life in account, she also throws her problems at my family when she doesn\u2019t feel like dealing with them. Needless to say after my niece was born my sister quickly realized that taking care of a child is actually hard. \n\nMe on the other hand have never liked kids and express often how much i dislike being around them. It\u2019s not just because they are loud and annoying, i do hang out with my niece often when my family is home and we play a lot. The real problem is when im home alone with her, i get easily overwhelmed and stressed because i\u2019m scared she could fall and get hurt and it would be my fault because she is under my responsebility. I don\u2019t plan on having kids because i know i can\u2019t handle the responsebility nor the commitment that comes with it and i also have told that multiple times to my family. \n\nFast forwards to one week ago, my niece has a scheduled surgery to remove her tonsils and my niece\u2019s father (31,M) was supposed to stay with her until her recover of 3 days but one week before the surgery my sister and my niece\u2019s father (i will call him nick) decided to break up. For reference, my sister and nick have broken up this past year around 4 times already and gotten back together. Every time that happens my sister moves in with my mother and me disrupts our life completely brings chaos and then goes back to nick after 2 weeks of drama and fighting. This time they decided to break up one week before the surgery and now neither of them want to talk to each other. \nOf course this has an direct impact on me because my sister and my mom will be working  and im the only one that \u201chas the time to take care of my niece\u201d even though nick took the days off of work to stay with my niece for the surgery. But because neither of them want to talk to each other i was assigned to stay with my niece until her recovery, i have told my family how i don\u2019t feel comfortable to stay 8 hours per day alone with my niece especially since she came out of surgery and i also think that my niece wants to be comforted by her parents after her surgery and not her aunt that dislikes kids. \nI told my sister to put her feelings aside and focus on whats more important, her daughters surgery, but she doesn\u2019t want to hear any of that. This past days i have been trying to convince my sister of not letting me stay with my niece but every time i bring the conversation up i get shut down by my family and told that i am the asshole for not supporting my sister through this rough time. \n\nThe question is am i really the asshole for not wanting to take care of my niece after her surgery?", "created_utc": 1693087917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1628d5g/aita_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_2_year_old/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don\u2019t you contact Nick and tell him when to come get his kid?", "NTA. These people need to grow the fuck ip and be parents for the sake\nOf their daughter.", "NTA but your sister absolutely is.  It is 100% your nieces parents job to take care of their child after surgery or reschedule it.  Can you go stay with a friend for the week to get out of the house?  Completely removing yourself from the situation seems the best solution.", "NTA- I like the suggestion of finding some where else to be and leave before the surgery so they can\u2019t abandon her with you. \n\nAnother option, get Nick\u2019s number and you tell your sister you will call him if she loves you alone with the baby after her surgery.  And preemptively call him and let him know what sisters plan is. I bet he\u2019ll be pissed about that.", "NTA but wth is wrong with Nick and your sister that they  let a petty argument, they broke up AGAIN, stand in the way if caring for their sick child?!!", "I don't think that you should have to take on this responsibility, OP.  *Both* of niece's parents should be there taking care of her.\n\nSurgery is still *surgery*, and her parents need to be the people in charge to watch for any unexpected complications.\n\nNTA", "INFO: do you have Nick\u2019s number?", "NTA. Tell her you have plans and leave for the day and turn your phone off or mute.", "NTA. You need to be firm & let everyone know you are not watching the kid. If they try to leave her with you, walk out of the house before they can & go somewhere. Tell them they can plan to have someone else watch her or get upset when you walk out. Their choice. Completely irresponsible of the parents to try to force you to do it. Call Nick if you have his number.", "NTA.", "NTA.\nThis may sound cold, but she's not your kid and not your responsibility. Your sister can either grow the hell up and realize that her child is more important than whatever drama she has with her on again/ off again ex and insist that he take care of his child or she can take time off to take care of her child herself. You've been upfront from the beginning that you wouldn't be left alone with her so it's not like it's a new development. \nBe firm, but not rude, and inform your mother and sister that you are not comfortable being responsible for a young child post surgery, that the child has two parents and a grandparent who can care for her and that you will be out of the house for those days. Find a friend to stay with for those days.", "NTA.\n\nBut.\n\nGo ahead, take the time to be with the niece, if you don't work, and can afford it. It's not her fault she has crappy parents.\n\nAnd then, lay plans to get the hell out of there.", "NTA  Caring for small children is a lot of responsibility and even more taxing when they are hurting and crabby. have any friends you want to visit or the sudden need to go camping? \nOh to add\u2026 Just because they broke up it does not excuse Nike from being a Dad", "NTA and lock yourself in your room or find something you have to do.

She needs to put aside her personal pettiness and do what\u2019s best for her child. Make yourself unavailable if you have to. Leave the house and stay out until you know your sister is home. Childcare is NOT your responsibility", "NTA. You told your sister your wouldn help with her child, and that is what she is making you do! Go stay with some friends starting on the date of your nieces surgRey, and stay for 3-4 dAYS. Temporily block your families numbers. Live your life.

Just because they broke up doesn\u2019t mean Nick can\u2019t still take care of his own kid.", "They don't want to take care of their child, that's what. Poor kid.", "NTA. Totally agree, also, am worried for your well-being.  Are you able to move out? It doesn't seem like this cycle of your sister moving back in is going to end any time soon, especially if your mom continues to allow it.\nStand your ground.  Do not watch your niece.  There's a whole lot of us that support your decision, so no matter what your family tells you and how they make you feel just remember we agree that you are NTA.", "Babysitters exist. Yes, expensive, but not your problem. That on your sister and Nick.", "NTA. I have kids, they have had surgery. I personally, did not enjoy caring for them then. It was horrible. I wouldnt ever leave them for someone else though. \n\nA child needs their safe person after a surgery. Sounds like you are not that person. I wonder if either parent could be thast person though....", "Do you have nicks number? Call him and arrange for him to collect neice from your home on the first morning. She can stay with him until your sister is free to parent.", "No i don\u2019t", "Where is Nick staying? If he has already taken off work then obviously he should be the one to care for his daughter. If they won\u2019t let him take her, tell them you will make arrangements for him to come over once they\u2019re gone to sit with his child. Then go somewhere. She\u2019s going to be back together with him next week anyway and you will be the only one who has been put out.   NTA"]}
