It might have been a bit of an extreme reaction with screaming at her, but it's understandable that it's the result of years of being treated like this. Your mother may need some therapy or counselling to help her come to terms with the fact she doesn't have a daughter - she's projecting this 'loss' on you. It might be an idea to sit down with her and tell her how you feel when the emotions have settled, and see if you can move forward together to still do things you both enjoy.", "You're NTA.

And expect them to change for you. Especially as a parents. Your mother is basically treating you like a doll, while pushing female stereotypes. Which are both harmful to a teen. You are complete right into yelling at her about it. \n\nAlso how does your brothers feel about it? Did they tell her something or just went with it?", "NTA, your a boy, not a girl, and your mother is not only insensitive, but also very much stuck in a faulty thinking.   \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd start making moves to move out, asap. While doing that, and as a pretext to it, throw away all the things your not comfortable with, and if she asks, just tell her that \"Mom, it's things for a girl, not for me\".   \n\n\nBut on a darker note, and this is important, you need to get your mother in therapy.", "NTA-your mom needs help.", "INFO: what the fuck did I just read?\n\nYou are her *MALE* child and she dressed you up as a girl and parades you about in make up?\n\nThat is messed up.", "NTA. You are your own person, not a doll for your mother to play dress up with. Among other things, your mother should be getting you a gift that *you* want, not what *she* wants. \n\nYour mother has brought this on herself by not seeing you for who you are, only seeing her own wants. Even by crying and going to her room, she is considering only her own feelings and not what she has been doing to you all these years.", "Info: you say you liked it as a kid. Did she have any indication that you felt this way before this incident?", "Info: have you ever spoken to her about how you feel? Does she think you're trans/CD and mistakenly think she's being supportive?", "If you used to like something but don't like it anymore, it's up to you to say so when you've changed. People can't read your mind or know how you feel inside unless you tell them.\n\nIf you wait and keep accepting things you don't like until you explode, then you're the asshole. You're responsible for knowing your own feelings and for speaking up for yourself before you lose control and blow up seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nIf you have told her that you don't like it anymore and she ignores you and keeps going against your words just to keep things how she likes it, then she's the asshole.\n\nIt's unclear if you've brought this up before or if you suffered in silence, hoping she would stop, so I can't judge here. Need more INFO.\n\nBut even if you sat on your feelings until they blew up, which makes you the asshole, it's understandable because it can be hard to put your foot down against someone who holds both love and authority for you. It's challenging to make them upset, but it's important to learn how to set your boundaries even when people aren't being intentionally malicious. Otherwise you end up hurting them and yourself more - like what happened here. \n\nApologise for yelling, talk about how it makes you feel when she gives you girly stuff, and tell her what kind of things you actually like and things you wish you and mum could do together instead. Hopefully she'll listen and accept your for who you are, otherwise you can revert back to screaming or just ignore the shit out of her (grey rock technique).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are the youngest of 5 boys and you mentioned in a comment that your dad died when you were two.  Could it be that your mother had a mental break at that time?  I think that both of you need to go to therapy to talk about what happened during your childhood.", "NTA\u2026 not even close\u2026\n\nAnd the fact that your mother treated you as surrogate daughter is messed up. It is as messed up as kids who are parentalized by a single parent for any reason. I\u2019m sorry you had to endure this\u2026 and honestly you responded with the truth. Period. If your mother is going to cry over the truth on your birthday now that you\u2019re an adult, that\u2019s on her. If it hurt\u2026 that\u2019s also on her. I\u2019m sorry that she never had the daughter she wanted but that is not a de facto reason to just make you fill the role\u2026 especially when you A) had no idea the real reasoning for it until later in life and B) could not consent.

The older and sassier my daughter gets, the more I remember why I wanted a boy. But she is who I needed.\n\nYour mom seems to have some serious unresolved trauma that she desperately needs to deal with. \n\nI'm sorry you were the one she took her issues out on. She should have never done that. It's one thing to let your kid explore their personality, but another to make them who you want. \n\nI hope you can get some therapy and realize it really is her own issues and if you have to go NC till she deal with them, THATS OK.", "NTA. Your mum needs professional help (I fear you, too, to be honest)", "Does your mum want to star in Bates motel? Because that's how you get Bates motel.", "Sleepaway Camp. \n\nNTA.", "The post was not what I expected after reading the title lol. \n\nI'm struggling to see what's objectively harmful about your mother's behaviour - after all, mothers doing girly stuff with their daughters isn't hugely frowned on, there shouldn't necessarily be anything \"wrong\" or \"unnatural\" about her doing it with you just because you're a boy. Gender norms should be broken down etc. \n\nThe idea of a boy being dressed up as a girl is I think what's so unnerving to some people here, but the fact is - involving gender or not, it's really hugely commonplace for parents to have this sort of vicariousness when it comes to their children. Raising their children to be athletes because that's what they want in their child. Or raising their children to get As on every test at school and drilling that into them from an early age. A parent shouting at their child for failing a test is arguably unfair and entirely selfish, considering the parents are prioritizing their own desires for their child rather than what the child wants or would want if they hadn't been raised to behave how the parents wanted. But this, as I said, is fairly common and not enormously disapproved of. \n\nBut I suppose the issue here is that she's been doing this *to* you - and also gender is a touchier subject because gender dysphoria can have such devastating psychological effects on people. The ideal parenting method should really not involve pushing gender roles on children at all, but nevertheless I don't think raising you \"as a girl\" is any worse than raising you \"as a boy\" - only biological males tend also overwhelmingly to turn out to be cisgender males, so she might have anticipated raising you the way she did would result in confusion later on. But it's not entirely clear to me despite your outburst at the end whether you are actually rejecting \"girlhood\" completely or whether you have been put in a position where you're not really sure of yourself anymore. \n\nAdditionally, it seems that while there might not be anything wrong with encouraging you to enjoy feminine things in moderation, your mother seems to have excessively pampered and fussed over you in a controlling manner. Bursting out at her might have confused her if she was completely unaware of your increasingly conflicted feelings, or maybe she was aware but was pretending otherwise. Anyway... the best thing to do would be to just explain how you feel as clearly as possible to her and have a DISCUSSION.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I'm a trans man, so while I can't say I know exactly how you feel, this kind of hits close to home for me. Forcing your child to perform for you is fucked up.

Adopted children are not puppies for lonely people.", "I have spoken up bit probably not very well, im a pretty timid person. As for my dad he died when I was 2.

In ANY way?", "Its complicated with my brothers. They dont like what mum does but they keep out of it. My brothers also have a lot of resentment since i was the \"\"favourite\" and mum spent more time with me due to all of this.", "As a kid I did play with \"boys\" and \"girls\" toys but i dont think that's any indication plus shes been doing this since i was a baby.", "I have told her before, everytime ive told her ive been pretty timid about it tho. I do hold a lot of anger from it tho. Its ruined my socialization with other males, my only friends are women which is fine but i do wish i had male friends. Im even having trouble telling what im interested in personally or if the interest is just something im supposed to like because my mum wanted me to. Sorry if im not making too much sense im pretty tired.", "His mother has been abusing him for years yet he's an asshole for shouting?\n\nWitw.", "Anyway you can live with your uncle?", "The reason I ask is you might be a tad assholish for not bringing up these feelings before you exploded. She probably thought you were just as into it as she was. \n\nObviously she is in the wrong for forcing it on you when you were younger but at a certain point you should have to communicated that to her.", "Then NTA.\n\nShe hasn't been respectful or responsive to your expressed wishes, and when people don't hear us we naturally raise our voices.\n\nIt takes time to figure out who we are when separating ourselves from our parents. Keep trying different thingsbwoth an open mind, and keep doing the things you like regardless of how you came to like it.

Where's the abuse?", "I understand your point. What I was implying was, OP could have just told her instead of screaming at her. The young man knows who and what he is.

Just because you didnt get a daughter doesnt mean you can treat your son like one.", "That is her fault though. No wonder he shouted and screamed at her. He's a young man thats been treated like a girl his entire life, not holding him to high social decorum of how he speaks to his mother is the LEAST anyone can do.", "He HAS done it before. At some point it\u2019s up to the mother to understand and stop abusing the kid.", "So you teach your kids to never communicate? I'm saying in future reference he should be more vocal about his displeasure before it gets to the boiling point.", "I think dresses are often too restrictive and kids should be able to move around and play in their clothes, but I wouldn't call it child abuse.\n\nShe never misgendered him from what I read, and he did enjoy the dressing up and bonding as a child, so not really abusive. It's when she kept doing it after he told her he didn't want to anymore that is a problem.", "Touche'.", ">I think dresses are often too restrictive and kids should be able to move around and play in their clothes\n\nIf *the child* wants to. Sure. It absoutely MUST be lead by the child and not by the adult because of the power dynamic. \n\nThat is textbook abuse, using a power dynamic to control and coerce the behaviour of someone.", "> It's when she kept doing it after he told her he didn't want to anymore that is a problem.\n\nThat\u2019s what actually happened.", "I largely agree the mother is being controlling but... would dressing the child up and combing their hair etc. still be abuse in your opinion if they were a biological girl? Your above reply quoting from the OP seemed to indicate the child being her son alone made dressing him up as a girl wrong."]}
