It might have been a bit of an extreme reaction with screaming at her, but it's understandable that it's the result of years of being treated like this. Your mother may need some therapy or counselling to help her come to terms with the fact she doesn't have a daughter - she's projecting this 'loss' on you.

It's challenging to make them upset, but it's important to learn how to set your boundaries even when people aren't being intentionally malicious. Otherwise you end up hurting them and yourself more - like what happened here. \n\nApologise for yelling, talk about how it makes you feel when she gives you girly stuff, and tell her what kind of things you actually like and things you wish you and mum could do together instead.

It is as messed up as kids who are parentalized by a single parent for any reason. I\u2019m sorry you had to endure this\u2026 and honestly you responded with the truth. Period. If your mother is going to cry over the truth on your birthday now that you\u2019re an adult, that\u2019s on her. If it hurt\u2026 that\u2019s also on her.

The older and sassier my daughter gets, the more I remember why I wanted a boy. But she is who I needed.\n\nYour mom seems to have some serious unresolved trauma that she desperately needs to deal with. \n\nI'm sorry you were the one she took her issues out on. She should have never done that. It's one thing to let your kid explore their personality, but another to make them who you want. \n\nI hope you can get some therapy and realize it really is her own issues and if you have to go NC till she deal with them, THATS OK.", "NTA. Your mum needs professional help (I fear you, too, to be honest)", "Does your mum want to star in Bates motel? Because that's how you get Bates motel.", "Sleepaway Camp. \n\nNTA.", "The post was not what I expected after reading the title lol. \n\nI'm struggling to see what's objectively harmful about your mother's behaviour - after all, mothers doing girly stuff with their daughters isn't hugely frowned on, there shouldn't necessarily be anything \"wrong\" or \"unnatural\" about her doing it with you just because you're a boy. Gender norms should be broken down etc. \n\nThe idea of a boy being dressed up as a girl is I think what's so unnerving to some people here, but the fact is - involving gender or not, it's really hugely commonplace for parents to have this sort of vicariousness when it comes to their children. Raising their children to be athletes because that's what they want in their child. Or raising their children to get As on every test at school and drilling that into them from an early age. A parent shouting at their child for failing a test is arguably unfair and entirely selfish, considering the parents are prioritizing their own desires for their child rather than what the child wants or would want if they hadn't been raised to behave how the parents wanted. But this, as I said, is fairly common and not enormously disapproved of. \n\nBut I suppose the issue here is that she's been doing this *to* you - and also gender is a touchier subject because gender dysphoria can have such devastating psychological effects on people. The ideal parenting method should really not involve pushing gender roles on children at all, but nevertheless I don't think raising you \"as a girl\" is any worse than raising you \"as a boy\" - only biological males tend also overwhelmingly to turn out to be cisgender males, so she might have anticipated raising you the way she did would result in confusion later on. But it's not entirely clear to me despite your outburst at the end whether you are actually rejecting \"girlhood\" completely or whether you have been put in a position where you're not really sure of yourself anymore. \n\nAdditionally, it seems that while there might not be anything wrong with encouraging you to enjoy feminine things in moderation, your mother seems to have excessively pampered and fussed over you in a controlling manner. Bursting out at her might have confused her if she was completely unaware of your increasingly conflicted feelings, or maybe she was aware but was pretending otherwise. Anyway... the best thing to do would be to just explain how you feel as clearly as possible to her and have a DISCUSSION.", "[deleted]", "NTA.
