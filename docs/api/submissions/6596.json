We have been discussing how to use our family leave. Each of us get 8 weeks of family leave to be used within the first year of the baby's life. My wife is planning on taking her whole 8 weeks right when the baby in born. She thinks that I should take 2 weeks when the baby is born and 6 weeks when she goes back to work so that we don't need to put the kid in childcare until he's 14 weeks old. The issue is that I want to use 2 weeks of my paternity leave to visit my family who live out of state so I don't have to use vacation days. I gave her two options:\n\n1. I can spend 6 weeks with the baby when she goes back to work but I won't take the first 2 weeks off.\n2. I can take 2 weeks off when the baby is born and then 4 weeks off when she goes back to work. This is my preference.\n\nMy wife says this is unacceptable and that I'm prioritizing my family over her and the baby. I disagree. I don't think it makes much of a difference if the baby starts daycare at 12 or 14 weeks. I only get to see my family once or twice a year since they moved out of state and I think this is a good opportunity to do so without it impacting our vacation time. I think her dislike of my family is affecting her logic and that, if they got along better, she would be fine with this arrangement. Plus, lots of men don't take paternity leave and their families manage. I'm still dedicating 6 weeks to the baby so we will have plenty of bonding time.\n\nAITA or is she being unreasonable?", "created_utc": 1672975837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104jgsm/wibta_if_i_used_part_of_my_paternity_leave_to/", "score": 1498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We have been discussing how to use our family leave. Each of us get 8 weeks of family leave to be used within the first year of the baby's life. My wife is planning on taking her whole 8 weeks right when the baby in born. She thinks that I should take 2 weeks when the baby is born and 6 weeks when she goes back to work so that we don't need to put the kid in childcare until he's 14 weeks old. The issue is that I want to use 2 weeks of my paternity leave to visit my family who live out of state so I don't have to use vacation days. I gave her two options:\n\n1. I can spend 6 weeks with the baby when she goes back to work but I won't take the first 2 weeks off.\n2. I can take 2 weeks off when the baby is born and then 4 weeks off when she goes back to work. This is my preference.\n\nMy wife says this is unacceptable and that I'm prioritizing my family over her and the baby. I disagree. I don't think it makes much of a difference if the baby starts daycare at 12 or 14 weeks. I only get to see my family once or twice a year since they moved out of state and I think this is a good opportunity to do so without it impacting our vacation time. I think her dislike of my family is affecting her logic and that, if they got along better, she would be fine with this arrangement. Plus, lots of men don't take paternity leave and their families manage. I'm still dedicating 6 weeks to the baby so we will have plenty of bonding time.\n\nAITA or is she being unreasonable?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe the baby wouldn't even have to start day care until 16 weeks.\n\n \n\nI'm inclined to agree with your wife but I don't have enough information. I really think a visit to them should be vacation time. Or why not visit them for 3-5 days during her second trimester? Perhaps consider taking off Thursday evening or Friday and returning Sunday or Monday?", "YTA why exactly can\u2019t you use your vacation days for vacation?", "YTA\n\nGiven you\u2019re clearly inexperienced here\u2019s my two cents:\n\nFirst of all mothers have a tough recovery from giving birth.  Best case scenario she gives vaginal birth and have no tears.  Her body will be sore.  Her strength will be reduced.  Her body will need at least a couple weeks to recover and recoup.\n\nWorse case scenario she is she has major tearing (which is like recovering from a major surgery), or C-section.  That will mean she\u2019ll need a longer period of time to recover and pretty much forced onto bed rest.\n\nSo as a supportive husband and father, you should take the first 2 weeks off to help as she\u2019ll struggle with a newborn and recovering from birth.  Having a baby is literally life changing and your wife needs all the support she can get.  So option 1 is out of the question.\n\nAs for option 2\u2026 there are so many issues with that idea.  First of all, newborns feed often and they have no sense of time.  That means they need to feed every 1-3 hrs so you need to stay up at least half an hour to feed, change their diaper and burp them.  Or it means they\u2019re awake in the middle of the night.  It may not seem tiring now.  But try doing it, everyday, for the first 5-6 months.  It wears you down\u2026 A LOT.  So reducing your paternity leave and dealing with midnight feedings will suck. And if you ditch your working wife (who needs to be awake during day time) for 2 weeks to see your family when your baby is like 3 months old will be incredibly selfish.  She\u2019ll be running on barely any sleep and she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep whenever the baby sleeps.\n\nYou may think 12 weeks is no different than 14 weeks.  It is for you.  But for babies their memory is like a goldfish.  Every day helps your baby build a stronger bond to you and your wife.  My spouse use to travel for work and every second week he comes back it\u2019s like hitting a reset button where he needs to rebuild a bond when our child was a baby.\n\nAlso the baby\u2019s development can be so different.  One day their only emotion they show is confusion or anger due to their needs not being met (because that\u2019s literally what it\u2019s like for the first few months). And then one day they suddenly they smile at you for the first time because they\u2019re happy to see you.\n\nMy point is babies attitudes and behaviours are unpredictable.  Ditching your wife and using 2 weeks of paternity leave to see your family is incredibly selfish.  You\u2019re fortunate to get paternity leave because your company recognizes the value of bonding with your newborn child.  So use it to bond with your baby.", "YTA.\n\nYou ARE aware that you are having a baby too, right?", "YTA let your family come see you.", "Always the spectacle when a clown reproduces.

I grew up with awesome parents, a dad that spoiled me and always did his part in raising me so now I have HIGH standards for partners.
