She had to leave halfway through the concert for an emergency and told us to have fun.\n\nI thought it was gonna be incredibly awkward just being at a concert alone with my girlfriend\u2019s friend I don\u2019t know well, but she was actually pretty cool. Turns out we get along decently and actually had some stuff to talk about as she\u2019s seen a bunch of the same anime as me. After the concert Drew said she had nothing to do the rest of the day and asked if I wanted to hang out. I suggested paintball, so we went to the mall to buy her sweatpants, a shirt, and sneakers so she had stuff to wear under the rentable overalls then we did that for a few hours. Afterwards we grabbed a bite to eat (not like a restaurant, just five guys). She said she had a great time and said she\u2019d be down to hang out some more if I wanted to.\n\nMy girlfriend for whatever reason was mad when I told her how my day went, when I thought she\u2019d be happy to know I was starting to get to know her friends better (isn\u2019t that supposed to be a good thing?). She said she meant have fun at the concert, not go off and spend the entire day without her when she\u2019s the one who introduced us. But she knows that\u2019s just how I am, I\u2019m likely to get caught up on some random side quest unless you specify not to. She\u2019s the one who said to have fun and now she\u2019s getting mad at me for doing just that.

Seriously\u2026 you were sooooooo busy spending time with another woman (and some friend she is, she clearly didn\u2019t care about your gf either). \n\nYou just tipped your hand. YTA and I predict that within 2 months you\u2019ll cheat with her \u201cfriend.\u201d", "Even if it's a full on date with another woman?", "Yikes, what a horrible boyfriend. YTA", "YTA. You went on a date with her friend and you lack boundaries. You couldn\u2019t even bother to shoot her a text and ask how she was doing or update her. She said to keep each other company at the concert, not the whole dang day. I would imagine you\u2019d feel the same if the roles were reversed. She definitely deserves someone more courteous to her feelings.", "Of course not, but he went multiple places with a girl he just met and didn\u2019t bother to text or check in with his gf once. Obviously this girl was more important to him than his gf, he has shown where his priorities are and his (current)girlfriend isn\u2019t one of them.", "I play Pokemon go and just got a fucking Oddish day notification that it's coming up on September 17th. Amazing.", ">I'm sorry, but paintball is normal behavior between friends,\n\nThey aren't friends, and you don't need to respond to every single post talking about how it's ok for people of different genders to hang out. Nobody is saying otherwise, you've just flattened the situation so much as to make discussion meaningless. \n\nOP's gf was dealing with an emergency. OP says he never checked in with her to see how she was doing. He's an AH, egregiously.", "Yes, he did. Check the comments. He totally tipped his hand here.", "Well when he was asked a similar question above he said \"What? We don\u2019t live together, I don\u2019t text her to tell her what I\u2019m doing unless it\u2019s relevant to our plans. Besides like I said, she was busy with an emergency.\"", "It's so cute, when they think the big 1 and 8 mean that they are all grown up, isn't it? \ud83e\udd23", ">its not boundaries if they weren't previously communicated\n\n\"Don't take my friend on an all day date when I'm dealing with an emergency\" isn't something that needs communicated in advance.", "Let's imagine her side of the story:\nAITA for blowing up on my BF for going on a date with my friend?\nI (19F) had been looking forward to taking my bf (19M) and friend (19F) to a music festival for weeks. Some of my favourite bands were going to play.\n\nAfter we had onl, spent a few short hours there, my dad called me about our dog having eaten some chocolate. I told both of them to enjoy the rest of the festival without me.\n\nI spent the whole day at the animal clinic and returned to an empty appartment. My boyfriend returned very late at night. He went on and on about how awesome Drew was and how in-sync they were. They had had great food and went to play paintball after the festival was over.\n\nI couldn't believe it. At first it sounded like they had actually cheated on me, but  the way he phrased it made that sound unlikely on his end. My anger didn't disappear though. Not entirely. I had spent the whole day dealing with crap and fear and they had made it a point to have the best day ever without me?!\n\nI admit I snapped at him, when he just called it a bit of a \"side quest\" and blamed me as I \"knew\" him.\n\nNow I called my sister's mother's best friend forever and they say I'm the a-hole?", "Of course my boyfriend is allowed to hangout with opposite gender friends... but they are friends. \u0130t's not okay to hangout and plan a day with some girl you just met. \u0130f you do, then it's a date, op literally was like \"hey i met this girl then we plan a date i don't know why my gf is mad about it\"", "If you consider meeting friends or family members 1-1  a date, then yes you're right. No romance was involved here.", "Fair, I'll say NTA then", "Jesus, straight people are a mess.", "Ahh you're right. He should have checked in with her. Mild a*****e then.", "Yeah\u2026he betrayed himself there."]}
