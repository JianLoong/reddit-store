A new place, none had ever been there.\n\nAs we walked in and asked for a table, the waiter made jokes like, \"Wow, did your boyfriends let you go out alone? I'd always keep you locked up, you're too cute!\", \"No? Don't you have a boyfriend? Better for me!\"\n\nYou could see that he said it jokingly - the pub is located in an area of the city where there are only pubs, bars, nightclubs: the staff tries to attract customers in every way, even with that kind of jokes - but for some reason it rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI said nothing, but pulled a face. The waiter saw me and told me that he was just joking, there was no need to be offended.\n\nI rolled my eyes and said \"whatever\", just to not start a sterile argument that I wasn't offended, just annoyed.\n\nWe sat down at the table and ordered drinks. I ordered a can of soda, as did another friend (others ordered beers or cocktails).\n\nWhen the orders arrived at the table, I saw that my can of soda had already been opened, while my friend's was still sealed. I told the waiter that I wanted an unopened can, and he (the same one who had made us sit at the table) was defensive, saying that I offended him very much with my insinuations (I didn't insinuate anything, I just asked a unopened can). He said that for him opening bottles and cans are automatic gestures. When I pointed out that my other friend's was sealed, he replied that the orders for the table were many, he hadn't seen it.\n\nBy then, other patrons of the pub were watching the scene.\n\nI stood my ground, demanding an unopened can, and the waiter replied that it was absurd to waste a can of perfectly good soda and insisted that I drink that, but I said no. I finally got the unopened can but we were pretty much ignored by the waiter for the rest of the evening and when we asked for a second round of drinks we waited a lot\n\nMy friends got pissed at me, saying that I spoiled the mood and made the waiter boycott our table (and that's why they think I was an a-hole).\n\nIn my opinion I wasn't: my request was reasonable and the way the waiter reacted set off alarm bells for me. Nothing happened, but better be safe than sorry.\n\nBut now I'm wondering if I overreacted?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEDIT after reading the comments:\n\n\\- my friends say I overreacted because we came as a group and left as a group. Even if my soda was tampered, they'd always be with me. I understand their point of view, but I will reflect on whether to go out with them again, because they still don't understand mine (why should I risk drinking?);\n\n\\- I paid for all my drinks, even for the soda I didn't drink, to avoid further exacerbating the situation.", "created_utc": 1682074002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12txqe7/aita_for_making_a_fuss_over_a_can_of_soda/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is probably the kind of story you should share on whatever site posts reviews of that bar.", "NTA any man who is offended by you protecting yourself needs to be watched very closely.", "NTA. The correct response from the waiter should\u2019ve been \u2018Oh I\u2019m sorry, sometimes we do that automatically/out of habit. Let me get you a new one\u2019. \nWhat a wanker", "NTA, sucks your friends are such asshats. They shoulda been happy to move to another pub after the first round.", "NTA I would have said if he\u2019s so bothered about wasting it then he could have it, or if he hadn\u2019t done anything to take a sip - same for the people that criticised you for being wary", "NTA 100% but get better friends", "Absolutely NTA. When it comes to your personal safety it is always best to err on the side of caution. Your gut told you that something was off. You trusted it. \n\nThere was no reason for your soda to be open. Especially if your friend's was not. More over, that is extremely unhygienic. Every resturant I've worked at did not allow for us to open closed drinks. \n\nThe way this waiter handled the situation was very telling. Regardless of his intentions, your request was not unreasonable. He should have had no problem grabbing you a fresh, unopened, can. His choice to escalate the situation and make a scene did him no favors in diminishing your suspicion of him. Also, if that was all it took to break him, he has no business waiting tables. Your request was on the same level as someone asking for a different glass of water because of, say, a dirty glass. \n\nIt's extremely frustrating when you are made to be the bad guy for advocating for yourself. And I'm sorry that the staff and your friends made you feel you may have done something wrong.", "NTA your friends have no sense of self preservation, he was being creepy AF by not just replacing the can.", "It's weird he opened yours and not hers.\n\nI've never been to a place where *if* they are going to open your drink they don't do it in front of you at the table (to avoid the claim \"Oh the soda was shaken and burst on me\" or something).\n\nNTA", "NTA if i was that waiter, I'd get you a new can and then complain about you in the kitchen, if I felt so inclined. (And I would still be TA) Service should be professional at all times. Sounds like he's the one with a thin skin.", "You handled the situation perfectly, OP. Who knows if your drink was tampered with but it's completely reasonable to ask for a sealed one. It's strange that your friends blamed you for the bad service when it sounds like yall could have just moved to another bar nearby. NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm a server and I do always open cans for my patrons. However, if someone requested an unopened can, I would oblige with no argument. One discarded can of soda is not a big deal in the slightest. If he was trying to prove nothing was wrong with it then replacing it quickly and happily would have been a better sign. The whole interaction sounds sketchy.", "NTA. If you were uncomfortable, you took exactly the right actions to protect yourself. The waiter\u2019s behavior made you uncomfortable. So did his followups. Your friends don\u2019t sound very good to me. If you had been roofied, would that have spoiled the mood too?  Personally, I would call the manager today.", "NTA. If your friend think nothing is wrong with your opened soda, they should have exchanged theirs with yours.", "WTFNTA that guy was so sketchy, like he might have asked about boyfriends to prove for information about who he can target.The open can at best was a dick move and at worst literally horror.", "These types of situations are tough because yes, your safety and comfort are paramount to everything else, but it also really sucks being on the other end of that kind of insinuation.\n\nIf it was like a random stranger bringing over drinks for you and your friends, then yeah definitely don't accept unopened cans. But the wait staff handle open drinks all the time. Also, every table service I've received, they bring your bottles and cans already opened if they're served that way, so it is likely legit that he just forgot to open your friends can. He may also have been defensive of it because 1) it's a shitty thing to be accused of especially when it's your job, and 2) his boss might be a prick that will dock his pay for wasted inventory. \n\nAlso from his angle, what does he stand to gain from that? You're with your friends, if he roofied your drink, they're going to take you home, not him. He would be doing that just to mess with you, which is kind of an extreme response for a frowny face response to his bad jokes. \n\nUltimately, I would say NTA, because you should never compromise on your level of comfort, but I also understand the other side of the story.", "NTA. If your friends had been opened as well, that would be different, but your friends still being sealed would have set me off too.", "You are in NO WAY the AH. There are so many stories right now about people being spiked and the fact that the waiter was inappropriate would raise some big old red flags to me. I could put money on your friends making a fuss if that had happened to them! You did exactly the right thing and made sure you were safe. That is very important and I\u2019m glad you stood your ground. The fact the other can was not opened was also suspect. Fair play to you for not being beaten down by anyone.", "Definitely NTA. The waiter obviously spit or did something to your drink after you hurt his little ego and I\u2019m shocked that your friends didn\u2019t piece that together or back you up. You need new friends to go out with.", "NTA\n\nImo if he didn't have any ulterior motives whether it be spit, drugs, whatever he'd have been a good server and just gone to get an unopened drink and enjoyed his free soda in the back. It's the fact he wouldn't let it go that makes it fishy.", "If your friends thought you were overreacting one of them could have traded their unopened can for your opened can. NTA.", "Idk how they weren\u2019t more uncomfortable about his defensiveness?? If there really wasn\u2019t an issue on his part he would\u2019ve diffused the situation and just brought u a new one. Someone in the back would\u2019ve drank the soda themselves if it were fine. NTA, and you\u2019re NEVER an AH when you\u2019re looking out for your safety.", "NTA. While it's 98% likely that your drink was fine, WHAT IF IT WASN'T? You are within your right to ask for another can of unopened soda, which would cost the bar like $0.30 probably. The server has, hands down, dealt with far more insane demands than that if he's worked in that business for even a week. He was inappropriate for the very beginning, didn't read his customers well, then proceeded to argue over something as simple as a friggin can of pop. He made this into a whole thing.\nI would consider sending an email or calling the manager and just informing them of what happened. You may not be the only one with this experience.", "NTA. You have to trust your instincts!", "\u2018Hello. I\u2019d falsely imprison you because as a man I should own you and decide what you are allowed to do. Now drink this suspicious beverage, woman!\u2018\n\nNTA", "NTA and I'd of left. I wouldn't of felt comfortable there anymore after he refused me a fresh soda and I'd of left. Screw your friends for not defending you and picking up on the serious creep vibes that guy gave off. In no way does a restraunt or bar open your can of soda for you. A bottle of beer maybe but not a can of soda. I've had plenty at bars when I didnt wanna drink.", "NTA. I'm old now, but a very similar thing happened to me in a bar. Normally, I'm not super observant or super safety conscience but that night there was something about the vibe that made me flash back to my mom warning me about accepting open drinks. The bartender gave me a really hard time about it as did all the regulars sitting around at the bar-that actually made me feel better about my choice, because the bartender could have easily just replaced my drink-and all the trying to convince me to drink it made we feel like there was something bad going on.", "Good you requested another can. As a man, It pains me to see losers push up on women with lame lines and even worse jokes. Your friends are fucking dumb for blaming you. There's a chance he didn't fool with your soda but why take that chance? Fuck that pub, fuck that server, and I might have to say the same for your friends. NTA!", "NTA\n\nHis behaviour was indeed odd. Where I'm from servers or waiters only open your drink IN FRONT of you or just place it down at your table.", "NTA even if you leave together: the dosage for rape-drugs easily can go to high (they should never be used, and every dosage is to high because it's s crime - but I hope you know what I mean) and you will end up in ER or dead.", "Well, I completely see your point of view... But I can also see his, if the guy is 100% legit and innocent. It is true that many waiters automatically open the can for you. Happened to me many times. And that banter and flirting is an attempt to gain tips and costumers. Do you think he wants to be doing that to every chick that enters the place? No, that is work for him.   \n\n\nNow, if the guy is innocent and is accused by implication of messing with your drink, I can understand his distress! That sort of accusation can be quite grievous for someone in that business.   \n\n\nHe could have handled it better, but it is hardly something common or that you train for, being accused of drink tampering.", "NTA - People are twisted, anything could have been in there.", "NTA- he could have done anything to that drink! Not just drugs! Your friends are huge assholes too! I would have said \"YOU drink it! \"  This is a situation where you should speak to a manager and give them a crap review.", "NTA - trust your gut. Something set off alarm bells, that\u2019s enough. \nIf your friends don\u2019t get that, you need better friends. Honestly, I would have walked out with you if I\u2019d been there.", "NTA I wish I could stand my ground like you did instead of allowing people to overstep my boundaries. Also those friends are wrong for blaming you for another persons actions especially when they are supposed to be working and not acting immature. They can't see the clear red flags and care more about the \"mood\" over their friends safety which to me screams superficial.", "NTA,\nIn that environment, never drink from something where the seal was broken or you didn't watch them make it in front of you. Good for you making the right choice.", "NTA, you are the guest and this is not a very demanding thing you are asking from him. And if he refuses, he is making the fuss, not you. I think I he was still a bit salty from your response, and was trying to make a stand. However, I also understand your friends a bit, there we looking forward to a fun evening, and in the end it was a bit ruined, was it worth it?", "NTA and good on you for not accepting a possible contaminated drink. I\u2019ve never seen an establishment open cans, ever.", "NTA. That waiter was setting off alarm bells for me too. It doesn't matter that your friends were with you if something happened, the waiter was really inappropriate and unprofessional. You don't joke about keeping someone locked up, and you don't make a big deal about the fact that someone asks for an unopened can. To then pretty much ignore your group for the rest of the evening is rude. I'd honestly be surprised if no one has complained about him yet.", "What reason exactly?  Besides, waitstaff always have access to your food and drink.  If the soda came in a cup, what would she do?", "Not to mention how the friends reacted afterwards, she didn't ruin the mood for acting the right way to be safe, it's the waiter who ruined the mood for acting inappropriately and potentially dangerous.", "I had exact same thought. Just go elsewhere together the moment it rubs you the wrong way.", "Or worse", "Those aren't friends, friends don't shame you for taking precaution during a potentially dangerous situation", "Agreed. They had to deal with a bad employee and blamed OP for his poor service.", ">I would lodge a complaint with the bar.\n\nI've been over the fence all night long about reporting what happened to the manager. For all I know, nothing happened to my drink, plus my friends said I overreacted.\n\n\rThat's why I came here, to have an indipedent and external perspective on it.\n\n\rAfter reading your post, I think I'll write a mail to the pub. I won't throw allegations around - because I've no proof - but I'll say that the waiter was strangely pushy and made me uncomfortable.", "The arguing is the part that i would've said \"get me your manager\" and i don't do that usually unless I'm really pleased with someone. Hell i called Walmart threw times because no one was answering to ask for a manager so i could tell them that this worker bought me water when i almost fainted in front of her while being 20-21 weeks pregnant and how that was more than i expected. But if a server was arguing with me about an opened can of soda then it's an immediate manager talk. I was a server. We never argued. We just did what we could for the customer. Any bartender would take that can back in a second and swap it out because that's a safety concern. I'd definitely complain even after that to a manager now.", "I don't think it was a joke I think he was probing for a victim.", "Either that or he was trying to mess with your head. Either way NTA, and any \"friend\" who didn't stand up for you is an asshole.", "Y\u2019all have never worked in a restaurant, have you?", "I like this.  \u201cTell you what, you drink that soda right now, and I\u2019ll pay for it and the new unopened one.\u201d  If he really was innocent, free soda for him and peace of mind for you.  \n\nAlso \u201cI\u2019d keep you locked up?\u201d  Ew.  Why would anyone find that funny?", "Stay sexy and fuck politeness", "If you're a waiter and the worst reaction you get to an inappropriate joke is the customer rolling their eyes, then you should consider yourself blessed and highly favoured.", "Meanwhile, the waiter can't handle a customer thinking his \"joke\" was stupid nor a very minor request for the way she wants her drink served to her. If that's what gets his knickers in a twist he's not going to last long as a waiter.", "This may come as a shock to you, but jokes are supposed to be funny. Talking about locking people up isn't funny. Read the news bro, things are fucked for women out there.", "Absolutely not.  Jokes aren't jokes if they aren't funny and this is a common tactic to slip things into people's drinks when they aren't looking. Her safety matters more than etiquette.", "My red flag warnings were going off reading this whole interaction. Did you talk to the manager? I would. This whole behavior is uncalled for tbh.

I would reach out to the owner or post a review of your interaction because no part of that is okay.

You did the right thing.", "Waiter's reaction didn't sit right with me either. His excuses to not replace the can didn't make sense; if the can was clean, one of the employees could have drunk it.  Even if they couldn't, the establishment wouldn't worry about the cost of one open can over customer's discomfort and safety. \n\n\nWhen the waiter refused to replace the open can, I probably would have said fine and either gone directly to the bartender to ask for a new can myself and/or asked for a manager to report the incident.
