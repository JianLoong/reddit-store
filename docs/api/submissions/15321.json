I'd always keep you locked up, you're too cute!\", \"No? Don't you have a boyfriend? Better for me!\"\n\nYou could see that he said it jokingly - the pub is located in an area of the city where there are only pubs, bars, nightclubs: the staff tries to attract customers in every way, even with that kind of jokes - but for some reason it rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI said nothing, but pulled a face. The waiter saw me and told me that he was just joking, there was no need to be offended.\n\nI rolled my eyes and said \"whatever\", just to not start a sterile argument that I wasn't offended, just annoyed.\n\nWe sat down at the table and ordered drinks. I ordered a can of soda, as did another friend (others ordered beers or cocktails).\n\nWhen the orders arrived at the table, I saw that my can of soda had already been opened, while my friend's was still sealed. I told the waiter that I wanted an unopened can, and he (the same one who had made us sit at the table) was defensive, saying that I offended him very much with my insinuations (I didn't insinuate anything, I just asked a unopened can). He said that for him opening bottles and cans are automatic gestures. When I pointed out that my other friend's was sealed, he replied that the orders for the table were many, he hadn't seen it.\n\nBy then, other patrons of the pub were watching the scene.\n\nI stood my ground, demanding an unopened can, and the waiter replied that it was absurd to waste a can of perfectly good soda and insisted that I drink that, but I said no. I finally got the unopened can but we were pretty much ignored by the waiter for the rest of the evening and when we asked for a second round of drinks we waited a lot\n\nMy friends got pissed at me, saying that I spoiled the mood and made the waiter boycott our table (and that's why they think I was an a-hole).\n\nIn my opinion I wasn't: my request was reasonable and the way the waiter reacted set off alarm bells for me.

The fact he was so defensive AFTER joking like that is a massive red flag. Your safety is more important than some guy being but-hurt.", "You're NTA.

That kind of joke is 100% for getting the dating status of a group of women.  And he even admitted he liked that yall were mostly single.  Also, the joke involves *wanting to lock up someone so they cant escape*, and making light of Possessive Jealousy.   I'm sorry, in what world is that remotely funny???  Red flag #1 \ud83d\udea9\n\nThe \"only one open\" soda is a No No right off the bat.  We don't trust those for good reason.  Bartenders ought to know to only open them for people in front of the customer.  He could have put them in glasses, but he left it in the can.  Red flag #2, though this ones more of a half-one.  Its a ping, but its not a blaring horn\n\nThe blaring horn is when he *ARGUED*\nA good server at a restaurant would see the problem, know exactly what the problem is, and *go get you a fresh one*.  His arguing makes him look HELLA SUS.  It could have been nothing- he could have been telling the truth that it was a habit, but he also could have spiked your drink, spat in it, put something unhygienic or such in it.  That right there is three red flags on its own \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nI would lodge a complaint with the bar.  They deserve to know if he is being a nuisance or a downright danger to customers.  They may have cameras that could prove or disprove tampering, but he will at the very least get a reprimand for his poor attitude.  For all we know, this could be a pattern of behaviour for him, and it could be the last straw.  It could also help him, as it could get him to have a discussion with the boss about what to do if it happens again.\n\nBut based on the info provided, his vibe is sexist and potentially predatory, and we should not let that shit slide\n\nAlso, as for your friends.  Ask them if the mood would have been spoiled if you had to be dragged out of the bar in an ambulance because you drank something spiked with a date r*pe drug.", "**Edit: Changing this to NTA from ATA.**\n\nAfter reading some comments, despite disagreeing with some, I can now agree on one thing that I missed.\n\nIT WAS better she stood her ground on how only her drink was open, it was important that she did reject the drink for her own safety.
