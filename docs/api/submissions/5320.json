I have a number of close friends in law enforcement who have to keep their firearm either in their person at all times (think FBI, US Marshal, &c) but *never* advertise that fact, keep it either concealed on their person or in a nearby lockbox, because they understand it\u2019s literally a death-dealing tool, and if they have to use it, things have gone really, *really* wrong, they\u2019re not wannabe hero cosplaytriots. Do whatever you need to do - I\u2019ve seen several really good suggestions here on how to go forward - but keep his gun out of your house.", "NTA.  \nHis hero fantasies alone make him a bad gun owner. Just tell him that no, his gun is not welcome.", "NTA\n\nYour house & your rules say NO guns. Tell him not to bring the gun. (I assume it's a pistol.) Tell him more than once. He can't say you didn't tell him that way.  He needs to listen & not bring guns to your house. And it makes no difference if he leaves it in the car! He brings guns, he leaves. Very simple.\n\nI grew up using guns. I own guns. They're registered. I also have them locked up & away from anyone's sight. My granddaughter has a 6 yr old. That child will never even know I have guns unless her parents say something. Or she's an adult & talks about wanting to go to the range.", "NTA. My partner wanted to bring a gun to my mother\u2019s one year\u2026.and asked me to ask her if it was okay. I told him flat out if he couldn\u2019t ask himself, then the answer is no. He asked, she asked about safety, she agreed with his plans and allowed it. \n\nshowing up armed for the holidays without confirming your host is okay with it is a dick move.", "NTA, your home, your rules, end of discussion.", "Not an asshole", "NTA", "Don\u2019t even need to read, your house your rules. NTA.\n\nAlso kids????? Around kids????? Never carry weapons knowingly around kids at a family party.", "NTA.  Admittedly biased, as I'm Canadian and the only person I know with a handgun is a cop, but \"no guns at my house\" sounds like a really reasonable rule!", "NTA as him making a point to open carry and act like he\u2019s some kind of badass makes him a chode. However, being \u201cagainst guns\u201d is a little childish and ill-informed.", "NtA - you have the right to set the boundaries for your home.  But I would recommend calling him or texting him privately.", "NTA 100%", "OP, you don\u2019t mention your spouse much. \n\nOne good rule of thumb is, you two should be on the same page.\n\nAnother rule of thumb is, each of you should do the heavily lifting with your own families.\n\nSo with that in mind\u2026Why not have your spouse talk to their brother?", "NTA. A responsible gun owner will respect your wishes and leave their firearm at home, or at least secure it in their vehicle with a lockbox if they aren't willing to do that, because responsible firearm owners **think about people besides themselves** when it comes to their guns. It's the gun nuts of the world who throw a tantrum when boundaries are set about guns in the house, and if **NOT BRINGING A FUCKING WEAPON INTO SOMEONE'S HOUSE WHEN THEY'VE REQUESTED IT** is too difficult for someone to adhere to without throwing a tantrum, then they shouldn't be surprised when they get uninvited to all future events at that house.\n\nBe diplomatic about it, but if he's the kind of paranoid gun nut you're making him sound like, expect it to not go well, and be firm with your boundaries.", "NTA. I\u2019m pro-gun but it\u2019s your house so your rules and if you don\u2019t want a gun in your house that\u2019s your right and he needs to respect that", "Nta your house your rules and that trump's his 2nd amendment right, he can carry the gun wherever he likes except on your property and if he doesn't like it he can stay home.", "This is the kind of guy that gives gun owners a bad name.  If he were serious about concealed carrying, none of you would ever have known he had it.", "NTA\n\nYour house / your rules. \n\nHe can leave it in the car.", "NTA. Again, another firearm owner here. If he truly was a responsible gun owner he would understand gun rights don\u2019t mean you can take them anywhere you want. There are MANY places you cannot bring a firearm into. \n\nPeople like him are actually making it worse for the rest of us. He makes us all look crazy.  First of all, if he was actually trained, he would know the only reason to remove your firearm from its holster in a group of people like that is to use it. Second, to proudly boast about \u201cif someone broke in\u201d is kinda scary. This guy has a gun fetish. He\u2019s fantasizing about using his firearm. Third, and I highly doubt it, but unless he has trained extensively, he\u2019s probably going to miss. Even trained officers miss in the heat of the moment. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d trust him in a crowded room with children and a firearm. I took an advance handgun class a couple of years ago taught by a sheriff. He shared the statistics with us. Only about 50% of shots fired actually hit their intended target. This is including people with training. So think about what his chances of actually hitting his target is. The way he was showing off his firearm tells me he doesn\u2019t have any training. We spent about a third of the class just learning how to NOT shoot people i.e how to hold in the ready position without pointing at bystanders, how to move with the firearm and not point at bystanders,  what\u2019s behind your target, what kind of wall is behind your target, even how to remove your firearm from its holster without actually pointing it at bystanders. I doubt he knows any of this. Which means you are more than within your rights to request him not bring a firearm into your house, it would actually be the responsible thing to do. In fact, if anyone of my friends waved a firearm around like you described, they would lose the right to bring their firearm into my gun toting friendly house, because it would be the responsible thing to do.", "I\u2019m from the U.K. and this is fckn WILD!", "As someone who is all into gun rights, I fully agree. BIL thinks he is a badass and would jump on the first chance he has to shoot someone. He\u2019s not responsible enough to own a gun.", "Sorry if I wasn't clear, this is my sister's husband. I agree about taking on the heavy lifting with each of our respective families, which unfortunately means I drew the short straw here, and BIL technically belongs to me :/ \n\nGood specification though, I should specify that my wife and I are on the same page. Both anti-gun. She is more worried than I am about the family fallout, so that's where we might differ a bit.", "also NTA \ud83d\udcaf please do not bring a gun into my home could not be more of a reasonable, sane, rational request.", "This type of carry enthusiast is the worst! I'm sorry you have to deal with him. Normal (mentally healthy) concealed carry believers never feel the need to talk about it. How annoying to deal with a guy with the, 'it's a good thing I'm here in case you need protection' vibe. Gross.", "Even if he agrees to come unarmed, he is gonna think it's cute to sneak a smaller gun in. On his ankle or concealed carry under his clothes. He isn't gonna respect your wishes.", "I wouldn\u2019t have him in your home at all. He sounds like a dangerous person and is a terrible gun owner.", "Can you have a conversation with his spouse, I\u2019m assuming your sister, about it first? In my marriage we have a \u201cyou handle yours, I\u2019ll handle mine\u201d deal, so if my sisters husband did something that bothered me, I\u2019d quietly take it up with my sister first. She would either advise me the best way to handle it with him myself, or she\u2019d handle it depending on the situation. \n\nIn your shoes, I\u2019d start by talking to my sister.", "He sounds dangerous. I would not invite that person anywhere near my house or any kids.", "Got it.\n\nClear NTA. \n\nGood luck. I hope they don\u2019t throw a hissy.", "Pretend guns don\u2019t kill people", ">**house lit up like an airport** \n\nClark Griswold, is that you?", "I should have said \"no toy gun\" rule.\n\nThey don't kill people either", "He can leave it in the trunk of his car.  I doubt anyone will ask him about his gun.\n\nI have an affinity for watches.  I guarantee nobody i see at Christmas parties or social gatherings gives a shit about it or would even notice if i weren't wearing one."]}
