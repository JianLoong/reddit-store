I would send a personal message or call, less chance of confusion. Start by saying you respect his right to own and open carry. This will validate his feelings. Next just let him know that just as you respect his rights. He needs to respect yours. This does not need to turn into a philosophical debate on gun ownership and what you think of people who own guns. Just state that you are aloud to dictate what happens within your houses walls. Again this isn't a debate just a statement that all should respect.", "NTA, this is reasonable. Your wife might be right, but simply asking someone to not bring a weapon into your home isn't an absurd request.\n\nI would recommend texting him individually rather than the group text, unless multiple people carry. Only because texting the group when it's only one person who does it might make it seem like you're publicly calling him out or something.", "NTA. Who brings a gun in someone else's house ?! You request is totally fair. \n\nIf he can't come without his gun, he can always stay home and \"safe\".", "nta. your house your rules. guns r tools and dont kill people, but dumb people with guns do kill people whether thats accidentally or intentionally.", "NTA. Everyone is quick to say \"my house, my rules\" on this sub; this is a situation where it absolutely applies.", "NTA.  It _will_ go over poorly, but he made his bed.  I'm in the gun businesa and I can tell you your brother-in-law is the kind of person we don't want in our community.  He makes us look ignorant and like we all have insecurity/ego issues.  \n\nHe's very irresponsible by telling anyone about his gun, let alone taking it out and showing it to people.  Dumb.  It's a loaded weapon.  It's supposed to be for defense in the unlikely chance you'll need it.  Not for waving around in some one-man dick-swinging contest making everyone uneasy, at a family gathering no less.  I can't express how inappropriate his actions are.  Along the lines of open-carry people.\n\nHonestly, he's probably one of those people that's trying to make you uncomfortable around him purposely because he knows you disagree with him.  Real winner.", "You wNOTbta, but you're gonna catch hell for this boundary, so be ready for it. Your house, your boundaries.

It is private property. He is welcome to carry in his house or car, but he can leave his gun there.\n\nYour wife may be right, but the kids will be safe.

Nobody should be around guns if they don't want to.", "NTA\n\nYour home, your rules. Its one thing if someone is carrying, another for them to make a spectacle of it. Sounds like he wants to shoot someone, which would make me uncomfortable too.\n\nBe ready for second amendment rights bs but I would stand firm that, in your house, he can not bring his weapon.", "NTA, especially because it's in your home. If it makes you uncomfortable, (and is a safety issue) that's all that matters.\nHowever, I wouldnt message him in the group chat, I'd talk to him personally.

It is your home and not obligated to pander to his fetish", "NTA and also Americans are weird.", "I know this isn't a helpful thing to say, but in general these questions of etiquette don't arise anywhere except the US. A loaded gun at the Christmas festive table just seems absolutely batshit bonkers. NTA. Good luck and best wishes of the season to you.", "NTA.  He's the sort of \"law-abiding gun owner\" that makes people hate guns, and their owners.  Does he at least have a lockbox for it, or does he just leave it lying around at night?", "NTA\n\nBut just FYI, he won\u2019t listen.

The whole point of concealed carry is to keep it out of sight. Him showing it off and making stupid comments to show off his imaginary superior courage and bravado are reason enough for the ask in my opinion. Nobody would of known he even had it if he was a responsible gun owner/carrier.\n\nIt's your house and you make the rules so that should be the end of it. It won't be and I can see him making comments about you not letting him bring it throughout the party. \n\nGood luck", "Who TF brings a GUN to a family christmas? Jfc. I would much rather have a pissed off BIL than a loaded gun everybody knows about. That dude is a major AH.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your BIL is quite self absorbed, isn't he? Most people I know who carry prefer to keep it hidden. This guy would get laughed out of any cop parties (all of whom are carrying, and none of whom would you spot it unless you were trained to.) \n\nAnyway,  this man cannot be trusted to use good judgement if he can't be discrete about his carry.", "It probably will go over poorly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that doesn't matter.

But then again, most of the time I conceal carry and nobody would ever know, so there's that.\n\nYou BiL sounds like an idiot tough guy with a gun.  They make the rest of us gun owners look bad.

Will be sending it privately instead of in the group.", "If it\u2019s a group do 2A supporters, a respectfully worded group text as suggested above might be a good idea. Add in something like it\u2019s a rule for everyone and not to Single anyone out\u2019. A lot of people who concealed carry do it properly and you\u2019d never know they are armed. That way you can know for sure your home is free of guns. \n\nThe asshole here is the gun nut fantasizing about being a hero. And I say this as someone who supports 2A and concealed carry.", "Yep.

Do it with witnesses, so they can see how unreasonable he is (if) when he flips out at you.", "Completely disagree. Trying to make a spectacle out of this serves no one. They are better off actually making a phone call, being respectful and just stating facts. Again this isn't a debate that needs a moderator. This is a family member that needs to be told in clear words, you respect their choices, yet they need to respect the home owners. End of story. No need to be dramatic.", "Sending a pointed group chat that singles someone out is always an asshole move, doubly so when everyone will know what single person it was aimed it. \n\nMature adults in their 30s and 40s can send one on one messages to sort something out rather than blasting them in a group chat like a middle schooler.", "No, there won't be a \"his version\" because the text is there *in the text.* If he lies you can always share the text later.", "How is a *text* something he needs witnesses for? He can screenshoot it if needs be. If there is only one person who carries a gun then he will know he is targetted in the group chat and that is majorly immature. Op's house, op's rules. A simple \"Hey, you know I like and respect you but I don't feel comfortable with guns in my house, could you please not bring one?\" is enough.", "I agree with you in principle however, I don't think OP is dealing with a reasonable adult. I could be wrong, i admit, but this guy also brings handgun to christmas.", "NTA I doubt he\u2019d actually comply. Oh, ammosexuals.", "I'll lead this by saying I'm a firearms owner and have a ccw... NTA. Beyond the \"your house your rules\" argument (which is 110% valid), anyone who carries and has an issue with being asked to not have a firearm at a specific function is precisely the person that shouldn't have one. In my mind, that's indicative of the difference between having a weapon as a last resort (which is fine) versus having a weapon and wanting a reason to use it (which is WAY NOT FINE).", "NTA.    Considering that he made a point last year of making sure everyone knew he was packing heat, I'd say he's probably the guy that everyone at the range says \"oh shit.   Gary's here.

His ego is not worth the risk if something were to happen.", "NTA\n\nYour home, your rules. You have every right to not have guns in it, it's a private property! If he can't abide by your house rules, that is on him, not you.", "NTA. As someone who was raised around guns, owns guns, and has family that owns guns...your house, your rules. I do carry and if I'm going to a friend's house that doesn't want me to have a gun, I lock it in my car. I don't advertise when I have one either. \n\nAlso, anyone who \"subtly\" shows off his gun and brags about protecting everyone at a family event has no business carrying a gun at all. That's the kind of idiot who shoots someone at a gas station for stealing a case of beer or something. Or shoots himself in the foot because he's practicing his quick draw in the mirror.", "Just ask him to leave it in his vehicle if he feels the need to protect his family while in transit. My brother and sister in law are against guns in any way. They made a request that when my nephew's were born that we never give them army, cowboys and Indians or any other gun related toys to them for Christmas or birthdays. It was known and adhered to thru out their bringing up. Never had a problem with it. When I go visit them I store my handgun in my truck and don't have problem with it.", "Yes, this is him 100%.", "Yeah, so I didn't share a lot of personality context about him because I knew it could skew the responses in my favor if everyone thought he was an asshole, but I can see the consensus has fallen that way anyway, so I can share now lol. \n\nThe dude is a QANON dude with a Napoleon complex. Loves to instigate fights, say incendiary things, and do it with a smirk, then make fun of people for getting heated. He will absolutely be a nightmare about this, and he'll make sure everyone suffers for it. But... such is life, I guess.", "But how in the very likely event that someone would break into a people filled house during the middle of Christmas DAY would he be able to protect you??? Just the dumbest thought ever, lol. There are 30 people in that house, good time to rob it...", "I was just talking with someone about how many kids in our district are getting guns now and asked if they know how. She mentioned that they have had a ton of gun thefts from cars, so it\u2019s definitely something they\u2019re targeting for sure.", "Its your house and you can set the rules for guns and you can ask your BiL to stay home if he is a rude boor and doesnt know how to act around people.  You are inviting family, friends, loved ones to your home for the holidays and to create memories to cherish.  Not to have your holiday ruined by someone who cant play nice with others and has the tendencies of a school yard bully.\n\nYou start with the gun and if he refuses of starts to give you shit about it, you ask himto stay home and then hang up the phone.  I know its easier said than done but you have a set of balls between your legs so use them", "Lol that is EXACTLY what I said last year. Yes, sure, BIL, on a street full of dark homes with no cars in the driveway, because they are likely out at someone else's house for the holiday, the intruder is going to choose the house lit up like an airport where you can clearly see 15 adults easily through the front window.
