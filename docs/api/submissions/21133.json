At the initial stages of dating, compatibility surrounding marriage, kids, pets and other commitment types should be discussed. If there is an incompatibility, then the relationship should not proceed. Both parties should have shared goals and if not, are not meant to be together. OP should've ended things as soon as OP knew there were animals involved."]}
