Don\u2019t believe her. You\u2019ll have to get involved. \n\nNow there is a chance you\u2019d grow to like them. But that\u2019s much more likely with a new puppy. \n\nPlus taking the dogs from their house is a AH move.", "NTA, pet homes are vile no matter how hard you try and \u201cmaintain\u201d it. The hair and smell are beyond fucking disgusting. \n\nIt\u2019s disgusting and fucking a massive asshole move to try and force you to live in a gross home.", "It sucks. When you don\u2019t like pets like me, you easily forget about their existence.", "Right and OP just assumed they would get their own way. Its fine to dislike dogs, but as a pet person I genuinely couldn\u2019t marry someone who didn\u2019t like them. Should\u2019ve discussed it before, considering OP literally knew she had and loved her dogs", "Exactly. At the initial stages of dating, compatibility surrounding marriage, kids, pets and other commitment types should be discussed. If there is an incompatibility, then the relationship should not proceed. Both parties should have shared goals and if not, are not meant to be together. OP should've ended things as soon as OP knew there were animals involved.", "You're the asshole.\n\n\nYou don't like dogs, that's fine, but why the hell marry someone who loves dogs and wants dogs in their own home? It's like hating children and marrying someone with children. That makes you the asshole.", "YTA for knowing she has dogs and assuming she wouldn\u2019t want them living with her again. Why was this not discussed before you got married?", "YTA for not considering that she'd want her pets to live with her once she was able to.\nYou're at an impasse and need to decide if you're ready to lose your wife over dogs. There's so many things you can do to combat your worries. Marriage is compromise. Welcome.", "YTA", "YTA.", "YTA because it doesn\u2019t sound like you discussed this with her at all before now. She also is a little bit an asshole for the same reason.\n\nAs someone who owns dogs, the only thought on my mind if I\u2019d had to leave them with my folks would be when I could get them back. Moving into a house would be the opportunity I was waiting for, and I\u2019d be absolutely crushed if my partner wasn\u2019t just as excited about that. As long as your wife is really truly okay with not bringing them, this can work.\n\nHowever, you two need to figure out: is this permanent? Do you NEVER want a dog in the house? Is she okay with that? It would be a dealbreaker for me, it would just make us incompatible. You two need to have this talk.", "YTA. You knew she had dogs when you married her. You knew she was an animal person and would likely be unhappy if she could not own dogs. \n\nPeople who want children should not marry people who never want children. People who love animals should not marry people who don't.", "YTA if they are her dogs, they deserve to be love and cared for by their owner", "YTA and this marriage isn\u2019t going to work. She will realize that you will never allow her to have pets and she will resent you. \n\nBut good luck", "YTA.", "If you hate pets why would you marry someone with pets? You ASSUMED she wouldn\u2019t bring her dogs. Did you ASK her?\n\nYTA.", "NAH - But:\n\nYou don't get into a LTR with a parent and expect not to have you deal with their kids, whether they have two legs or four. \n\nSo really evaluate if this marriage is for you, and if you'd both be better served with alternative living arrangements or not being married.", "YTA\nYou married someone who has dogs. Your wife should be able to keep her dogs at her home. She assured you she takes 100% responsibility for them.", "YTA- by the way \u201cpet homes\u201d don\u2019t always have a smell.  I have 3 small dogs and a toddler running around and every one complements how clean my house is all the time and how great it smells.  If anything the toddler is stinkier than the dogs", "YTA", "Yta", "NTA. The dogs have been at her Parents for 4 years? The wife isn't a pet person, or she would have Never given up her dogs in the first place. She has waited to impose the dogs on the OP.", "NTA. Provided that this is a mutually agreed upon thing. You're right to not want dogs in your house. I suppose if she's upset about not having the dogs she wouldn't move in. There is nothing you've suggest they would be neglected at her parents and you're right about it being their home.", "YTA - you knew she had dogs before you married her and was a pet person. Did you guys not discuss the idea of having pets in the future when you got married? Imo pets are a package deal when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone. Suck it up.", "YTA. Why the hell would you marry someone who likes pets if you aren't a pet person. It would be an immediate deal breaker if i was dating someone and they didn't like pets. There's nothing wrong with that, but I can't be with that person. Hell, for me it would be a deal breaker if I was dating someone and they only wanted small dogs. Nothing is wrong with small dogs, but I prefer big dogs.", "YTA - dogs are only here for a short amount of time. If you wife already had to leave them with her parents for work after rescuing them and now she has the opportunity to be reunited with her animals..... seems selfish and like a red flag that you wouldn't be supportive. However, I'm an animal lover so I think you two are just incompatible. I could never marry someone who \"wasnt a pet person\".", "Info: did she get the pets before or after you?\n\nYou're quite special if you didn't have this conversation very early on in the dating period. If someone has pets then they'll almost always choose the pet over the partner.", "YTA, you realize after these dogs die she\u2019s gonna get more dogs right? Pet people will always have pets, this is part of who your wife is, take it or leave it", "YTA, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s just sprung 2 dogs she\u2019s picked up on you, she had them when you met!", "OP is TA for this particular, but it is a poor reflection of his AND his wife\u2019s communication for getting married without each finding out what the other feels about pets.", "I agree with your general sentiment, that you don\u2019t abandon pets, but pets are nothing like children.", "I mean she also needs to decide whether she wants to lose her husband over dogs. I'm astounded at how many people would jack in their marriage for dogs they'd already been failing to care for. All I can say is, that you shouldn't have got married if that's how little you care for your spouse.", "Counterpoint: she\u2019s a responsible dog owner who knew she couldn\u2019t provide a good life at the time, thus leaving them with people she trusted who would be able to do so, until such a time when she could take them back.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Force them to suffer in a tiny apartment while she runs herself ragged trying to fit in pet care? When there\u2019s a suitable place for them to go? Really? The dogs should suffer because if she leaves them with someone who cares for them she\u2019s \u201cnot a pet person\u201d? I\u2019d argue she\u2019s a more responsible owner than the person who refuses to put the dogs well being first.", "So glad to see this after numerous knee-jerk response from people who won\u2019t accept some people don\u2019t love dogs, but give a pass to the \u201cpet-lover\u201d who for four years prioritized literally everything else in her life *except* her dogs. She doesn\u2019t get to impose her dogs on everyone else in her life. Those aren\u2019t her dogs anymore at this point. OP is NTA, wife definitely is.", "Before. She adopted them \u201c(before we met)\u201d", "It seems like she lived at her parents house as well for the majority of the time?"]}
