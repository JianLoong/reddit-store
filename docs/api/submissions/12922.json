Apparently unlike my boyfriend, I do not need to be attached to it and I don't believe I need to run all over kingdom come to charge it. My boyfriend also always thinks I've blocked him when I don't pick up. Historically he has made lots of fake phone numbers to try and reach me to confirm whether or not he was, in fact, blocked. He usually just uses his Google Voice number nowadays as I have learned to never let my phone be dead for more than 2-5 minutes, so he hasn't had the need to make a bunch of other numbers.\n\nYesterday, there was a huge hacking scare at the law firm I work at, and I had to come in early to deal with it, with a little bit of his help because he is into cybersecurity and all that and he usually knows what to do if something like this happens. \n\nI fell asleep early last night and I did not plug my phone in, which means that by the time I got to work, it was dead. But I have a phone charger at work, so I plugged it in immediately. But things got hectic because of the hacking scare, so I didn't get to turn it on right away. It was maybe 15 minutes instead of 5, which is already pushing it in his opinion lmao.\n\nThe second my phone turned on, I called him. I knew he'd be pissed so I told him straight up that he was on speaker phone and that my coworker was right next to me in order to make sure he remained a little more calm, yet he still proceeded with an attitude in front of my coworker,\n\nI went upstairs to tell him good morning officially, because we hadn't spoken yet. But he still had this attitude and said \"Why is it that when your phone 'dies' the calls from my number don't go through, but my Google Voice number always goes through?\" Now folks, this has happened exactly twice within the past like 8 months. He refused to believe me that my phone was DEAD and I called him AS SOON AS IT TURNED BACK ON. He insists that something weird was going on.\n\nI explained to him that if he calls nonstop for 15 minutes and then my phone finally comes on, obviously those calls are going to start coming through. It has nothing to do with which number he is using. The phone was off, then it was on. I asked him to explain to me why he thinks I blocked him, and he didn't say anything. I told him to think about it rationally (with an attitude, admittedly) because why would I get to work, block him for 15 minutes, then call HIM? It just simply doesn't make sense to me. What reason would I have? \n\nAnyway, he wouldn't leave me alone about my phone dying and OMG WHAT COULD IT MEAN THAT HIS GOOGLE VOICE NUMBER WENT THROUGH, BUT NOT HIS OMG, so when he said \"I think I should go...\", I said \"Yeah, I think you should\" and I hung up on him. I haven't gotten any texts, and I haven't sent him any. I know that I am going to hear it about not being sorry, or worse, I'll get stonewalled all day if I reach out to HIM.\n\nAm I the asshole for hanging up on him or should I have been more sympathetic to his anxiety?", "created_utc": 1679494767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yki79/aita_for_hanging_up_on_my_boyfriend_because_he/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend doesn't trust you, and immediately assumes malicious intent when you can't reach you. That is NOT healthy in any kind of relationship. NTA, and I think you need to get as far away from him as you can.", "NTA consider not being with a borderline abusive and controlling boyfriend. He's wildly insecure and it's only going to get worse over time", "Your boyfriend seems extremely controlling and jealous, that is not a healthy relationship.  \nHow often does he call you? Is he keeping track of you? Do you think it's normal or ok to be interrogated and accused like this?", "NTA.  Why are you dating someone so controlling?  If you are \"more sympathetic\" to his anxiety, you will be living with it forever.  Is that how you want to live?", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 run. \n\nThis is abusively controlling behavior and you need to get out safely.\n\nNTA.", "\"Historically he has made lots of fake phone numbers to try and reach me to confirm whether or not he was, in fact, blocked.\"\n\nThink I can stop reading there. That's some casual psycho behavior.\n\nNTA and you may want to look at some different prospects.", "I didn't even need to read the entire post to come to the conclusion that your boyfriend is unhinged. Run for the fucking hills! NTA", "NTA. Your boyfriend's expectations and behavior are beyond unreasonable.", "I hope this will provide the wake up call you need : Dump his ass asap . Major r\u00e9d flag right here\n\nNTA, he's borderline if not full abusive.", "NTA AT ALLLLL. Girl, this man sounds like an immature baby at best, a potential abuser at worst. He doesn\u2019t trust you, needs you to constantly validate his unfounded fears and anxieties about you, and becomes irrational when he can\u2019t reach you within 5 minutes of calling you. When I first started reading this, I thought you must be in high school but then you said you work at a law firm, meaning you\u2019re both grown adults. His behavior is ridiculous and honestly, break-up worthy. You do not need to be available to him constantly. The fact that he goes as far as making fake numbers to call you makes me feel like if you do try to end things, he\u2019s going to react extremely poorly. From what you\u2019ve shared, this sounds like an extremely unhealthy relationship based in distrust. Take some time to really think if this is what you want in a relationship now, and think about a year from now, five years from now, ten years from now. You can either break up with him (which is what I think is probably for the best here) or have a conversation with him to let him know that he needs to start trusting you and get off your back.\n\nEdit: I saw in a comment that he cheated on you with 30+ women and used to constantly stalk your location??? DUMP HIM NOW!! I\u2019m really sorry but it\u2019s only going to get worse\u2014no matter the good parts of the relationship, you don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this and you cannot salvage this relationship. When you do break up with him, make sure it\u2019s in a public place, preferably with another person you trust near by. This man sounds like a total lunatic\u2014get out of this relationship ASAP and stay safe.", "NTA, he can't even come up with a reasonable answer to your questions. If this IS anxiety and it's this bad, he should really be working on himself to solve it rather than sitting in a relationship and allowing these issues to affect it.  \n\n\nIn a comment you've said:\n\n\"Would you believe that the last time he got bad about this sort of thing, he was cheating on me with like 30+ different women, and it turned out he was just projecting? Man, the stress lmao.\"\n\nIf I'm reading that correctly and he has cheated on you, you'd be TA to yourself if you stayed in this relationship for longer than you should have.", "NTA. \n\nYour significant other is trying to control you. He's effectively treating you like he's a helicopter papa, which is a *CRIMSON* flag for any reasonable adult.\n\nI can't speak for your relationship in any way, of course - but I've seen folks go through similar situations and ended up feeling endangered by that same person later on. I'd take exceptional caution with this relationship, if I were in your Jimmy Choos.", "NTA\n\nAnd after reading your other comments I have to wonder why you're with him at all?", "NTA. Good god. I'm guessing that a hundred other people will tell you that this isn't rational behavior and you should leave him. I'm not going to do that. I'm assuming you are a smart person and eventually you will see that he is a controlling, needy boyfriend. Someone that anxious needs to find help, therapy works.", "This is so obviously an abusive man that there is no need to think hard on it. NTA", "Nta.  Why does this guy need to call you so often?  Why is he so controlling?", "NTA he\u2019s controlling and will never believe you. You wrote in one of the comments that he\u2019s been cheating on you before, I can imagine he thinks you do the same and he\u2019s judging you based on his own behavior. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s cheating again. It\u2019s not anxiety, it\u2019s assholeness. \n\nI\u2019ve had a boyfriend once who was controlling and suspicious as well. He was expecting me to answer his texts within 5 minutes even if I was at work. He straight up told me he doesn\u2019t trust me, which was rethink the relationship. I tried to explain his behavior, cause apparently his ex has been cheating, but this doesn\u2019t give him the right to control me. \n\nSo, run. Leave the ass and find someone who will respect you, your work and your personal space.", "NTA. You're dating an insecure boy. Dump him and find a man.", "NTA\nGet out of this controlling relationship now.", "NTA . Girl, he's also cheated with you with 30+ women? You are long, long overdue to break up with him. Carefully, though since he sounds like one of those guys who wouldn't take a break up well.", "NTA. He sounds unhinged. I\u2019m curious as to why you decided to keep letting this go on. You sound like one of my friends, it seems like y\u2019all enjoy dating paranoid men, I don\u2019t understand it.", "NTA Sounds like he's still cheating, thought you found out and blocked him. I wouldn't be surprised if he's projecting because his cheating never stoped. If a friend's partner was behaving this way, what advice would you give them?", "NTA\n\nThere is nothing funny about any of this, it isn't normal or healthy. \n\nCut bait, reel in your line, and leave that fish in the sea.", "NTA\nThat's not anxiety that's paranoia.", "OP, being alone is better than being with a control freak. Save your sanity and reclaim your peace by moving on. This type of behavior never improves. Next, he'll be telling you what he thinks you should wear or who your friends should or shouldn't be. You deserve better.\n\nAnd of course, NTA for not tolerating unreasonable responses to a perfectly normal occurrence.", "NTA. But why are you still dating this guy after he\u2019s shown you he doesn\u2019t trust you at all? This isn\u2019t about him having anxiety, he is controlling you. You should have been out the door when he started spamming you with fake numbers, so if you want to stay with him, you\u2019re basically accepting he will always act like this.", "NTA - please understand that your boyfriend's behavior is not normal.  Maybe it didn't start out this way, but this level of stalking and controlling behavior is not okay.  Please end this before he hurts you.", "NTA.\n\n\nFrankly ... there are too many red flags to continue this relationship.\n Of  course the decision is yours to make.\n\nInsecurities kill a relationship... believe me ... I know!!!", "So your phone dies and in his head your instantly up to no good? He needs professional help to deal with his issues. Stand your ground, you did nothing wrong. He's the A hole here. He should apologise for his sh*tty attitude.", "NTA. Time to dump this controlling weirdo. He seems to have no ability to trust you. One of his exes must\u2019ve done a number on him\u2026or he\u2019s just an unstable person all around.", "NTA and you should probably reevaluate this relationship. Being tethered like you described is alarming", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is being highly possessive and controlling. This is big red flag behavior.\n\nPlease re-evaulate this relationship.", "NTA.\n\nHon, you've probably been told a hundred times already that this guy is not actually relationship material.  So I'm going to just ask you a question:  Can you imagine an hour, a day, a week, an entire year of never having to wonder when he is next going to attempt to blow up your phone because his issues told him that you are being a meano by not immediately responding no matter what is going on in your life?  I note that you were AT WORK and he wanted you to respond instantly AT WORK and got upset when you took a whole 15 minutes to respond to his personal stuff AT WORK.  Kiddo, how much of your precious energy does dealing with his nonsense take away from you?", "Nta, ive read the comments, break up right now. He\u2019s abusive, he already was before the breakup, he wants to own you but you dont get to own him. You\u2019re a pet to him.", "Just saw your comment about how he not only cheated, he mega-cheated.  Actually he didn't just \"cheat.\"  He behaved like a single man.  He did not have a relationship with \"30+ other women.\"  He *fucked 30+ other people because he thought he could.*\n\nAgain, NTA.\n\nYou already don't have a relationship with this guy--or more precisely, the relationship you have with him is not a partnership or a foundation of trust or anything like that.  He is anxious about you because he doesn't like being the one who is left, instead of the one who leaves, and he knows perfectly well that you have grounds.\n\nYou don't have to establish the perfect conditions to leave.  You don't have to do it neatly or with closure.  Just go.\n\nAnd while you're building up your strength to do that?  Get an STD panel.", "Uh, this isn't anxiety it's abusive and controlling\n\nNTA for not charging your phone, but you are a massive asshole to yourself for subjecting yourself to this.", "NTA I didn't really read past 15 minutes instead of 5. I'll probatgo back and finish but it's unlikely to change my vote. This is abusive controlling behavior. Shit happens and phones die, or sometimes get broken. He doesn't get to be angry about that. Unless you disappear for days, he needs to get tf over it.\n\n If you guys live moved in together (it doesn't sound like you currently do) he'll start timing your commute to and from work and accusing you who knows what if you aren't back in the time he seems appropriate. You'll start regulating yourself, just like you have with the phone, and soon you'll nlu go to and from work with no stops. Then comes isolation from friends etc etc etc \n\nThis isn't healthy. I know you love him but you deserve better than what's coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
