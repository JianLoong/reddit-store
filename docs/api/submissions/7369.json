My aunt and cousin were living with my grandfather but my dad was given power of attorney. My dad hired nurses to take care of him during the day. My sister and I were still in high school but we lived 1.4 miles away so after school we would relieve the nurses for a few hours until my dad got home for work. A year after my grandfather's stroke, my mother had a brain aneurysm and stroke herself. My dad gave power of attorney to his sister to focus on my mom's care. \n\nUnbeknownst to us my aunt and cousin began bad mouthing my father, sister and I, saying we were neglecting my grandfather not visiting etc which was not true, I would call and talk to my grandfather at least once a week but couldn't see him because I no longer lived in the city because of college and my sister still visited almost daily.\n\nSince she had power of attorney she somehow convinced my grandfather and other relatives we no longer cared for him and had my grandfather's will changed so everything he owned, went to her when he died. She sold everything except the house he lived in. We got nothing, not even family albums with our pictures in it.  \n\nA few years later our relatives saw for themselves how greedy and money hungry she was. My great uncle owned a thriving liquor store but wanted to retire, and she offered to take over. He gave her all the inventory with the promise to pay him each month. She didn't do it. She kept odd hours and raised prices which stopped people from coming. She was making no money and couldn't pay for the inventory let alone the rent. The store closed. \n\nMy father died in 2013, we involved her in the planning, but since then I have only seen her once at a wedding. She did not acknowledge my mother's death in 2020, didn't show up, send a card or call.I personally didn't tell her, one of our relatives did and she was in the family chat and email chain that gave information. \n\nTuesday she called my sister and told her that my grandmother had about an acre of property that was willed to my father and her. We did not know about this land. She said she wanted to sell it because taxes have gone up and she couldn't afford it. The property wasn't in my father's will because  he didn't know about it, so my sister and I needed to sign heirship paperwork. We told her ok, but needed to have a lawyer look at it. Turned out my aunt has not paid taxes in over 20 years and owes $8,888.65. She signed the contract to sell the property for 25k in November, with it being finalized in December. The company found out she didn't own the land completely and stopped the sale. So,she never planned to tell us about the land or sale, and was going to keep the money to herself. I told our lawyer I wasn't signing anything. Her lawyer told us that then we were responsible for half of the back taxes. I said I wasn't paying either. That I would rather lose the land to auction for lack of payment than to let her have a dime.

When my great uncle died last year, they wanted to do a slide show from when he was younger and since my grandfather was the oldest (15 years older than him), he had all the photos from the late 1800s of my great great grandparents  ( he was born in 1916) etc, she refused  to let anyone scan them. The only photos anyone can get about them is from a series about African Americans in Texas from the institute of Texas cultures that she let borrow and scan that anyone can view in a local museum. Last year another museum had an exhibit on black cowboys that she let borrow and scan our family artifacts but she gatekeeps everything.", "That's what our lawyer said. He requested a copy of the will, I have never seen it, so waiting for a response.", "For a long time he was the only grandparent we had. Both my mother's parents and my father's mother died before I was 12 and he lived very close and would pick us up after school.

That is the most pathetic excuse.  Better hope nothing comes up that that money could take care of.", "Less than 4,000, you have to take out inheritance tax. I'm more angry that she has known about this for over 20 years, did not pay a $50 yearly tax this whole time causing the taxes to skyrocket and has the nerve to call, not to check how I'm doing, not to say Merry Christmas or Happy New Year... I live in my parents house which is a mile and a half away from her so she could essentially walk and put a notice in my mailbox but calls now after so many years because she wants money ... that's why I'm angry", "You're using trifling wrong, it means small or cheap and I'm neither. Plus you misunderstand my point. This all could have been taken care of 20 years ago, so I'm not going to waste my precious time doing paperwork just because she needs money.

My cousins and I drive down for BBQ at a certain spot and then stop by this DELICIOUS Tex-Czech  bakery for sweets. They have a 5lb cinnamon roll that is to die for. I look forward to the drive, we go every few months or so for festivals etc.", "OP, May I offer a suggestion? (Do the math first to make sure this works to your benefit.)  Offer to buy her half of the land from your aunt for a very minimal amount, but certainly not more than the amount of back taxes. She should agree because even $3,000, for example, is better than nothing.\n\nAfter you buy the land, sell the land and pay the outstanding taxes out of the sale proceeds at closing. Only do this if there will be a satisfactory amount of profit left for you and your sister (if the land is truly only worth $25,000, it may not worth it). \n\nJust a thought. NTA, and best wishes.", "This is important history! You and your relatives should storm her house and ale possession of your family history by force! Also consider if the land in question is culturally significant and see if any other family would be able to co own it with you.

At least she is where I\u2019m from. Not the US though.", "NTA\n\nI think you have made the right call for yourself.  Basically you have decided not to invest any more time and, more importantly, emotion in your Aunt.\n\nA few of the people here talking about how you will get money from this don't seem to realise that some things are unforgiveable even after so many years i.e. her mentally torturing your grandfather by making him believe that the rest of his family had abandoned him so she would get his money.  That is so cruel.\n\nThis isn't really revenge; it's about punishment.  Not getting the money will hurt Aunt a lot more then you getting some money.\n\nAlso, if you are so inclined, you may also have evidence now of her trying to commit embezzlement / defraud you.  The cancelled bill of sale etc.  Although she could claim she didn't know.", "NTA but you need to see the copy of your grandfather\u2019s will. What else did she sell or keep that was willed to your father??", "I mean, obviously, talk to a tax lawyer and inheritance lawyer.\n\nYou will be an asshole to yourself and to your grandfather's memory if you don't soak your aunt for as much money as you can.  And also remember to calibrate for the amount of pain - if she can absorb a $9k loss with little pain, then sticking her with a $9k tax bill is less effective.\n\nBut, no, you have no responsibility to get your aunt out of a hole of her own making.  Talk to people who professionally understand these sorts of things, and then do what is best for you, including letting her twist in the wind.\n\nNTA", "It's also an issue that as power of attorney she persuaded your grandfather to change his will favoring her both because if the power was active he may not have been of sound mind and that poa can't use it for their own benefit", "NTA\n\nHer actions are disgusting, she deserves to be taken for every penny you can wring out of her hands.\n\nI would also see no issues whatsoever here by playing by her rules - she was more than happy to lie and steal from you, so I see it as perfectly fair to do exactly the same in return. \n\nA lot will depend on the rules where you are, so consulting with a lawyer is likely necessary to figure out what options are legal and available. For example if her neglect over executing the will and hiding the property from you can land the full legal costs that are outstanding on her rather than you, then that sound great to me. \n\nAnd if it is too much effort to earn any money yourself from this situation, as long as you are covered legally I would see no problem in salting the land and making sure she cannot get anything from it. Petty perhaps, but still better than she deserves.", "NTA. Know someone who did this to her brother. Handled his estate. When she passed her husband had to contact her baby brother. About a house and antiques. She'd lied about everything. Brother had to reopen the older brother's estate to sell the property. A mess shady lawyer included.
