I said to him that I have nothing against him at all and that I never offered because I didn't think he could have them. he was very confused so I explained to him the gelatin in them. he didn't know that gelatin is infact produced from cow hooves. he acknowledged that piece of information and thanked me for telling him. that was that, or so I thought. \n\nwhen my shift was ending I was taken aside by my manager and asked why I was forcing non-vegan sweets on the vegan coworker.

This is elementary school all over again. Thanks to that guy, I guess none of your coworkers can have candy anymore. They can thank that guy. \n\nUnless your company decides they are providing food, they can\u2019t stop you from bringing your own food. That has to be a human rights breach.", "NTA. What kind of vegan doesn't know gelatin is an animal product?\n\nGet a note from your doctor explaining your low blood sugar issues, keep the sweets on you, and stop offering them to coworkers. Explain you were reprimanded for your generosity so you can't offer them to others anymore, but you still need to have them so you don't pass out.", "NTA  your boss is being stupid because the candy is related to a medical issue.  Sharing them is not.  \n\nYour vegan coworker sounds like the angry kind.  \n\nSo if you want to keep sharing candy I would buy some nasty over priced vegan kind and apologize to your rude vegan coworker.  Bag sealed so the label is on it.  Apologize for excluding them.  Give them bag of candy", "it is a confusing interaction and you shouldnt be obliged to have vegan sweets lol. just let your manager know that you need the sweets for your low blood sugar", "NTA - they are your sweets. This isn't 3rd grade. Vegan D-bag can bring his own candy.", "NTA and it sounds like time to loop HR into the conversation. Your manager and coworker are being ridiculous.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. Is this something you could get a doctor\u2019s note for? Even then, it may be best to just stop offering sweets to anyone, but you shouldn\u2019t have to. If your manager wants your coworker to have vegan sweets so badly, he should supply them himself.", "NTA. It's not your job to provide snacks for your coworkers. Your boss can't make you share or stop you from sharing. He can't dictate what kind you eat. To CYA, get a doctor's note saying you require snacks for medical reasons.", "NTA - Why would it be your responsibility to go out of your way and spend extra money just to accommodate a fussy co-worker?\n\nDoesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nI also think your employer just set themselves up for a lawsuit.  They are aware of your medical needs, the reasonable accommodation is that you carry sweets with you (which costs them nothing and has nothing to with your job performance).  If they now prevent you from doing that and you become ill or collapse, you could sue them and would win!\n\nI would now avoid this co-worker whenever possible, he\u2019s obviously a snake looking to cause drama and trouble.", "A very light unintentional YTA for not occasionally bringing something you can share with him as well. I don't think there was any malicious intent behind your snack choices, but sharing with others when you knew it wasn't appropriate to share with him wasn't very kind. Your boss should have said no sharing unless everyone can partake instead of regulating what you're allowed to bring. \n\nPS. You might want to look into getting your blood sugar issue listed as a disability. Your job has to make reasonable accommodations,  i.e., having candy on you in case your blood sugar drops.", "NTA. If the office wants to supply them, they can get vegan ones. These are yours and you are paying for them. You are not required to share with anyone. Even if your reason was you didn\u2019t like him, that\u2019s fine. You are not the keeper of his feelings nor the provider of his sweets. Go to HR and report him and the manager. This is BS.", "NTA. And you can't be forced to provide sweet to everyone.", "Thanks to that guy, I guess none of your coworkers can have candy anymore. They can thank that guy.", "NTA - why do some vegans have to act crazy/entitled. Do you think it\u2019s the lack of meat?\n\nAlso, considering you keep the snacks for medical reasons, I\u2019d get a note from your doctor and notify your manager that they\u2019re discriminating against you.", "Nta but you might want to be aware a lot of gelatin contains pig I did not know this until I met my husband who is Muslim and informed me.\nSo if you have co workers who are Muslim or Jewish you might want to not offer then candy either.", "NTA, explain that you need to regulate your blood sugar but will no longer share with anyone if that is a problem. Then a little later let your co-workers know that you can no longer share because someone complained.\n\nThe best kind of compliance. Malicious Compliance.", "NTA.\n\n1. Contact HR\n\n2. No more sharing your sweets with ANYONE. You were never obligated to share, you did it from the goodness of your heart and while sure it sucks that you don't have vegan sweets to share, it's not your job or responsibility. So nobody gets sweets now. More for you!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d go back to your manager and just say that you never meant to discriminate against anyone, and if it\u2019s becoming an issue you\u2019ll just stop sharing the sweets, but remind them that the whole reason you carry them in the first place is for your own health so you\u2019re going to continue to keep your own supply for personal use on you. \n\nBut also, you should see a Dr about this!", "OMG, NTA.\n\nFirst off, you aren't providing the sweets to everyone. They are for you, and you give them to other people who want them. The vegan doesn't want any. You are not excluding them. (Also, side note, how are they a loud vegan who doesn't know where gelatin comes from?! The vegan police should revoke their vegan card.)\n\nSecond, I would be shocked if your manager is as equal opportunity about accommodating the vegan as he wants you to be. When they order for the office, does the vegan get an option? A good option, equivalent to what everyone else has, and not just a side salad with no dressing? Do they get desserts when everyone else does? Do they get the same number of options as everyone else when you all go out for lunch? We wouldn't want to discriminate against the vegan, after all. \n\nThird, this whole thing is asinine and I apologize on behalf of all vegans, but if you want to shut people up, get some Swedish Fish, or Dum-Dums. Or Smarties (the US kind). Get whatever the cheapest, worst vegan candy you can find is, and offer it to the vegan. If they like it, buy a different kind until you find one they don't like. If they like all of them, get sugar-free ones. If that doesn't have adequate side effects, find some candy from another country - there are things like salty black licorice and spicy fruit candy that are probably vegan (I haven't checked) and are acquired tastes that this person will almost certainly hate. Now you've complied!\n\nFourth, your candy is effectively for a disability. I don't know where you are, but I'd hope that your country has some kind of disability laws that would protect you and treat your candy as a reasonable accommodation for your medical issues. If your manager truly tries to take it away from you, make a stink.", "Just keep a box of sugar cubes for him.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Time for a doctor\u2019s note and glucose tabs. If you are getting an exemption for a medical reason treat it as such.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd you have surmised the problem with lots of fanatical Vegans. I would never expect or complain about a Vegan not feeding me meat to be inclusive and not discriminatory.", "NTA and super confused about your management\u2014 when did work regulate what you have for your own health and snacks? Unless someone is allergic, who cares what you bring for food?", "NTA, and it sounds like you have an undiagnosed blood sugar condition. Please go see a doctor and a dietician if you are able.", "The part about him not understanding what gelatin was tells me he's probably not been avoiding it. He's upset that you brought it to his attention. He may eat it regularly and is now feeling bad. You changed his worldview.That doesn't give him a free pass to make work harder for you. I think you should look into glucose tablets also. I'm diabetic and know how bad low blood sugar feels. They raise your blood sugar quickly and have a decent variety of flavors online. Pharmacies usually have 1 or 2 flavors, but Amazon has a bunch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
