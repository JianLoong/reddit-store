Our wedding is not going to be very fancy overall and we're not doing all the traditions. Being raised by a single mom, I decided to walk with her and my sister who is my bridesmaid. My fianc\u00e9 decided he wanted to walk with his three siblings who are his best people (the four of them are very close so all got an equal spot). My fianc\u00e9 has a stepmother. She's been married to his dad since he was 10/11ish. She married his dad two years after his mom's death. She has always felt like the four were her kids but they do not return the sentiment toward her. My fianc\u00e9 has told me before he often felt like she was insensitive to their loss and that he always felt as though she believed she was entitled to be their mom without trying to acknowledge or help honor their actual mom. So my fianc\u00e9 tolerates her existence but is also not close to his father due to the trouble from his childhood. For the most part his father does not seem to care that 4/6 kids (he has two with his current wife) are not close to him and have more of a distant extended family relationship with him.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9's stepmother told him she wanted to do a mother and son dance with him at his wedding because she saw from my mom's FB that we were doing one together (mom has posted about needing to practice, etc). My fianc\u00e9 told her she was not his mother so they would not be doing one. She tried to change his mind but ultimately failed. So she turned around to tell me I needed to convince him and when I said no, she pushed it harder. I kindly attempted to explain that it was my fianc\u00e9's decision and that she should maybe consider it would be hard for him to dance with her instead of his mom. She told me he should be glad he has a mom willing to fight for this. She then told me I should just tell him he's doing it and as his soon to be wife I have the right to do this. At this point I was more annoyed than anything I told her I am not my fianc\u00e9's boss and will not be telling him what to do at our wedding and that includes telling him to dance with her. I told her I am not bullying my future husband into something he said no to and I told her she needed to accept the no.\n\nShe called me a drama queen and said she never claimed I was his boss but that he would want to make the day special for me. Then she told me it was a bad way to treat my future MIL. My fianc\u00e9 said I did good. But his stepmother and dad said I was rude for reaching so much and I worry I did go too far. But my fianc\u00e9 sees this as a sigh that maybe he will take them off the guest list.

Rest easy OP your soon to be hubby is right,  you did really good! Unfortunately, with the type of person his step mom is you need to set hard boundaries very quickly or she will steamroll you.

No need to tolerate demands from people who have no right to make them, especially when they're absolute nonsense.

I will never understand this conviction that some older generations have that once married, one partner has to do what the other says. In this case (and mine) because the woman knows best and men are some helpless creatures who need to be guided through life.
