Lola and I have been living together for two years but Abby was a new addition. I\u2019ve known Abby since high school but we weren\u2019t exactly close friends during that time. In the last year we have been hanging out more and more and have gotten closer. So we all decided to get our first apartment near our college campus together.\n\nSomething to understand about me is that I have intense OCD tendencies due to trauma that I experienced both from my parents and from another incident a year and a half ago. I am currently trying to work on it with my therapist but it's a struggle. Both my roommates knew of this before we moved in. Lola doesn\u2019t have a problem with me having control of the organization since it keeps everything nice and clean. Abby, despite saying it was alright, has fought me on everything since day one.\n\nShe has been unwilling to compromise in many situations and caused a lot of stress and anxiety for Lola and I. It doesn\u2019t help that Abby and my dad are incredibly close and really good friends. He even takes her side on many of the issues and has teamed up with her on occasion to try and prove Lola and I wrong. I have been feeling very trapped in this situation since she\u2019s always over at my parents house and my dad will usually reprimand me for not \u201callowing\u201d Abby something when all I\u2019ve ever tried to do is compromise for both of our comfort.\n\nI understand that living with someone with OCD can be very challenging but I have tried so many different things to allow us both comfortable living. Recently, we had our biggest disagreement yet and it was when she put her groceries out and above the cabinets despite there being a free bin for her to use so that the groceries don\u2019t show. It really bothers me and causes me anxiety. I bought her the bin to try and help but she says it's too hard to use. I tried to compromise and move my stuff to a higher cabinet so she could take the easier to reach cabinet but she basically said that if she can\u2019t use the space normally then she will move back in with her parents and not pay utilities. This caused me to have a breakdown in the kitchen that Lola had to talk me down from. I\u2019m now losing sleep over the issue because I know that something isn\u2019t right in the home and I\u2019ve had constant overwhelming anxiety ever since. My hands also shake now as a result.\n\nI want her to be comfortable in her home since it is a shared living space but I also believe everyone should be comfortable. She has also brought up issues in the past just to get a rise out of me and has told me as such when I inquired about her not following through with our compromises. I just need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong for pushing her to this point.

I know you said they were told before but did they witness it to really get what it would be like?", "YTA. If you share a kitchen, it's fair for you to get a third of the space, but not reasonable to say that groceries can't ever be visible because you don't like it.

So maybe she is doing things on purpose to trigger you. So that sucks on her part.\n\nBut you aren't going to manage your OCD by giving in to it. The OCD is telling you that everything will be ok if you can control what  everyone is doing all the time. The more you give in to that feeling, the more it's telling your mind to do it again. Right now, it seems like living with other people is triggering you more so you don't have the energy to fight to make yourself better. \n\nBig hugs, I have been there myself and it's the hardest thing to question everything your brain is telling you.", "Gentle YTA\n\n> so that the groceries don\u2019t show.\n\nBeing able to see groceries isn't hurting you.\n\n> I tried to compromise and move my stuff to a higher cabinet so she could take the easier to reach cabinet\n\nThat's not compromising, when her issue is not wanting something **in** the cabinet *at all*.\n\n> I\u2019m now losing sleep over the issue because I know that something isn\u2019t right in the home and I\u2019ve had constant overwhelming anxiety ever since.\n\nI do not think you are in a place now where it makes sense for you to have roommates.", "I'm going with soft YTA\n\nShe may have said she was all right with this situation but she may have not known how what it really would be like until she was actually living it.\n\nI can see it being frustrating to be in a situation where it's not coming to some compromises but instead having to go by someone else's rules completely that makes someone not comfortable in their own home.\n\nI do think your roommate should be understanding but I can see it being unbearable that her life inside the home is revolving around one person's comfort and her comfort is treated as  not mattering because she doesn't have trauma or a mental health issue to navigate.", "YTA\n\nThe OCD is not your fault, but blaming your friend and making her live your way is wrong. I wouldn't want to use a bucket either. \n\nI lived with someone who had OCD. She would try to sort everyone's groceries by type instead of who bought them... which caused my ADHD to forget what I had. We had originally agreed to split the space up evenly, so everyone got the same amount of space. She wanted to sort everything the way it made sense in her brain... but I absolutely refused.\n\nWe hated each other by the end of the year.", " NAH - don\u2019t get me wrong, you are behaving like an AH but you are struggling with OCD. You should not live with roommates really then if this is how it is impacting you.", "Soft YTA. I have OCD too, and forcing someone to change their behavior to quell your anxiety is just as bad as you engaging in the compulsion yourself. It\u2019s a temporary band-aid that allows you to avoid the feelings instead of feeling them.\n\nAn open conversation here is needed. True compromise is something that everyone agrees upon, not what you decide for them. Also, try cutting Abby a little slack and let that be some exposure therapy for you. If she feels like everything she does is wrong then she\u2019s not going to try, because what\u2019s the point.", "Yta, your ocd is your responsibility, not hers.

You are just an entitled AH trying to control your roomate, and she is right to resist and fight or ignore you. But why would she move out? She is very good at defending herself against your assholery, and she can not even manipiulated by your \"breakdown\" drama - she just ignores that. So she already has WON.

You don\u2019t need to live with roommates, your OCD is pretty out of control. This isn\u2019t healthy for you or them.", "NTA\nHaving OCD doesn't make you an expert in what is a reasonable ask for someone else's OCD, so take all those comments with a grain of salt. What's important is that this situation is not working. You need to stop trying to manage everyone's feelings about this. Abby overestimated her ability to live with someone with OCD. You can only compromise so far before you destroy your own mental health and progress. Y'all need to figure out:\n\n1. What everyone can afford.\n2. Who is staying and who is going. You and Abby cannot live under the same roof. Which of you does Lola want to live with?\n3. A timetable for getting it all sorted that is as fair as possible to everyone.\n4. What can everyone do to de-escalate things until it's over.\n\nLeave your dad out of it as much as possible. You're all adults and this isn't his home. He was not issued a vote in this situation. Honestly, you having to leave your childhood home so she can stay in your room is sus. Are you sure they're not having an affair? \n\nEither way, it doesn't feel like Abby is treating you like a friend anymore. Keep that in mind as you negotiate. It is unlikely you will be friends after this, so don't make compromises you wouldn't make for someone who is only an acquaintance.", " ESH yes, you have to compromise a bit more if you are going to have roommates. And her relationship with your dad is super weird and setting off alarm bells in my head. I cannot imagine that a lack of support by your dad is helping your OCD at all.", "My bf was being ocd about our house, I let him do a few things but there was a point where I had to put my foot down and say no. We\u2019re not doing that. \n\nI think he wanted to remove the sink so we could put it straighter, this house is a rental.  I said don\u2019t look at it.\nThe sink isn\u2019t bothering you, don\u2019t bother the sink. \nHe\u2019s eased up a lot on his compulsions lately. \n\nMaybe your roommate wasn\u2019t the best match for you anyways, neat people should live with other neat people.  But you should practise not having everything perfect, I think it would be really good for you. \n\n\nYour dad being \u201cclose friends\u201d with her makes me very\u2026 uncomfortable... \nI\u2019ve never seen any grown adult wanting to hang out with someone so young, they wouldn\u2019t have a lot in common. It concerns me more than your roommate issues", "Yes, between the cabinets and the ceiling. There is space above the cabinets where you can put bins or other things. I have bought four bins that food can be stored in that are placed in that space. The box faces are not visible without pulling the bin down.", "We are arguing about organization and usage of shared spaces. Like leaving your things out after using the space. She did witness my OCD before we moved in together since I was in a tough roommate situation before as well. She was completely understanding and accepting at that time.", "I care about her so I didn't want her to feel not wanted. I'm worried about  my family's thoughts since her and my dad are extremely close. I just felt trapped in the moment. Thank you for your comment though.", "I didn't want to drive her out of the apartment since she is my friend but the compulsive thoughts wouldn't go away and so my body couldn't move. One of the compromises was that she wanted to put her flour on the counter but I said it would get to cluttered. So, despite not wanting the flour on the counter, I said we could clear my stuff away and put it in the cabinet so she could have the space and container for her flour. She never moved her flour and its been months. So I  just kept my stuff in the space after she said that she didn't actually care about the flour.", "Thank you. I really appreciate it. I'm trying to work on things with my therapist so I am seeking help.", "Normally I would agree with this, because OCD is OP's to handle. However, she does appear to be working on managing it with therapy being clear about it and getting her agreement BEFORE SHE MOVED IN.  \nWhat is really concerning though is that she is involvingOP's father in disagreements with roommates. It's especially troubling that he sides with her, when she has out right admitted that she does some of these things simply to get a rise out of OP.\n\nThe roommate is much more of an asshole than OP is. And, I am getting a creepy vibe of her trying to usurp OP's place in her own family. Dad should have no say in what is happening in that apartment, he certainly shouldn't be taking sides.   \n\n\nHer whole temper tantrum about moving out is just that. Let her. She never intended to be accepting of your condition and is actively working to make it worse for you. The fact that she has seen you manage this and STILL intentionally does things to get a rise out of you and admits to it proves it. \n\nSeriuosly, get this girl away from you - she does not mean well.", "That doesn\u2019t resolve her from being an asshole. I have OCD as well and it is *my* cross to bear. If she really can\u2019t handle it and expects to be able to control her roommates lives to the point where they can\u2019t even put groceries out, she needs to live alone.", "Sadly but I agree. It is your issue not hers and if you can not live in a shared space with others without the need to monopolize the space, YTA. Just because you say 'I got OCD' when they move in does not mean people understand what it is like living with someone that has it.  \n\nYou shouldn't live with anyone really unless you find another Lola.  \n\nSorry this is harsh I know but you gotta understand your conditions and issues in life are no one else responsibilities and you have to make the compromises on your end. The only people that will compromise are those that care about you, which helps you figure out who is who. Good luck!", "Only public spaces. Her room is her room and its her personal space. She and Dad got close because she was his student at one point and then worked on research together. When we became friends they really started to hang out more and more. Now she sleeps at my parents house sometimes in my old bedroom and stays for dinner a lot. I actually had to leave once because she was coming home with my dad for dinner. My mom didn't want any conflict which is fair. Basically Abby and my dad are very similar and love the same things so they hang out all the time.", "They just hang out a lot. They are very like minded people who enjoy spending time together.", "Thank you for your response. And to answer your question, no, I'm almost 100% sure they are not having an affair. I don't think that would ever even develop. Its just a strange friendship.", "Yeah... I'm afraid that would be an absolute no go for me as well. Everyone has different styles of organization. I can put things in cabinets  but I need to be able to see everything, not dig through a bin after lifting multiple unnecessary pounds up over shoulder height.\n\nThe bin thing would drive me absolutely batshit to the point of resenting you and, yeah, not wanting to share that space.\n\nNot going to say YTA  but you know you can't force your way on everyone.", "Why is a 19 year old so close to your dad? Is that weird to anyone else?", "> getting her agreement BEFORE SHE MOVED IN\n\nAre we really expecting this random 19 year old to 100% fully grok what it means to live with a roommate with OCD before she's even done it and that she has no room to push back at all on unreasonable demands?  Was there any reason for Abby to hear \"oh, I have OCD\" and immediately understand that every single item she ever brought into her own home would be subject to inspection and designated placement in the house by someone else?", "> Just because you say 'I got OCD' when they move in does not mean people understand what it is like living with someone that has it.\n\nYeah, unless OP is [Sheldon Cooper](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/The_Roommate_Agreement), I don't think it's reasonable to think that this random 19 year old would immediately understand that everything she ever brought into the house was going to be judged and specially placed by OP for the duration of them living together (to say nothing of where she keeps her toothbrush & body wash in the bathroom, or if her Xbox is visible under the TV, etc)", "Ok. Thank you.", "NTA then. She knew about your OCD before moving in, and you\u2019re actively working on it. \n\nHer hanging out with your dad is, well, kind of eww. It\u2019s one thing to share interests, etc, but hanging out at your house, spending the night, having dinner there regularly\u2026 Your mom is okay with that?", "Such a weird dynamic. I would never ask a child I raised to go home so a friend can sleep in their room unless it was an emergency. Couches are a thing! \n\nBest of luck getting everything sorted, OP!", "Ok. Thank you for your comment", "Right? Is your dad her dad?", "No, I am not expecting her to fully know what it means. Even though OP does say that Abby has witnessed her dealing with her OCD prior to moving in with them.\n\nWhat is expected is for the roommate to be understanding and not bring OP's father into the equation. Sorry, no matter what Abby expected or not, she has shown that she is an asshole. \n\nShe admitted to doing things that trigger OP's OCD to get a rise out of her. She is involving OP's father in roommate arguments and pushing OP out of any safe space she has. \n\n>I have been feeling very trapped in this situation since she\u2019s always over at my parents house and my dad will usually reprimand me for not \u201callowing\u201d Abby something when all I\u2019ve ever tried to do is compromise for both of our comfort.  \n\n\nThere is no way you can tell me that Abby is some victim of OP's out of control OCD. Abby is up to something suspicious.
