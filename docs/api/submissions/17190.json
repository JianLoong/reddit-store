It started about 10 years ago when her mom passed away.  Her father remarried very quickly, within 9 months of his wife\u2019s passing.  My wife struggled with this and especially hated the stepmom because she was cleaning out the fathers house of all the deceased wife\u2019s stuff.  My wife wanted all of it.  We weren\u2019t together then but she said it took weeks of car trips just loading up old stuff.\n\nThe stuff included literally everything from my wife\u2019s entire life.  Her mom must\u2019ve never trashed anything.\n\nMy wife filled up 2 storage units with old bins.  Not just pictures and jewelry.  We have most of her moms old clothes.  Every school art project since 1990.  There are 100 lbs of beanie babies.  There are bins of just plastic junk like pencil cases, mugs, old bills and bank statements.  My wife wants mementos of her mom and doesn\u2019t trash documents with her moms hand writing.\n\nWe are moving in 5 weeks and we have an excess of bins everywhere.  With the exception of clothes, kitchen appliances, etc, my other personal stuff is like 5-8 \u201cbins.\u201d  My childhood stuff is 1 bin.  My wife has probably over 100.  We spent all day moving 40-50 bins from the basement to garage in anticipation of moving. \n\nShe has bins in the powder room shower.  Bins in every closet.  Bins in the attic.  There might be over 30 bins of just Christmas decorations.\n\nThe living spaces are clear and free.  But all closets and storage areas are packed.\n\nNow here is the actual \u201cAITA.\u201d  I\u2019ve been getting fed up with this shit.  She moved in 5 years ago and this was an issue.  I pressured her to reduce and she did get rid of stuff.  But obviously a ton made it into my home.  \n\nI get angry and eventually yell.  I yelled at her and told her it\u2019s all meaningless shit and bank records with her moms handwriting wasn\u2019t important since she has other stuff with her handwriting.  I yelled that she has a bin of 10 purses that were her moms and she will never use any of them since they\u2019ve been untouched for 5 years in my house and 10 years since her mom passed.\n\nI yelled some more whenever I find a useless bin with items she\u2019ll never use.  It\u2019s a trigger now for both of us.  I want shit gone and she is devastated to part with any of it and directs that sentiment towards me.  \u201cI\u2019m making her\u201d is how she view it.\n\nShe has this protective shield excuse of \u201cmy mom died.\u201d  And when I yell, she gets defensive at first but then acts like the hurt puppy dog.  She barely talks to me, she\u2019s cold and short.  Overall unpleasant interactions for a couple days.\n\nThings return to normal until next week when I trip over a bin of seashells and old sandals trying to dump our recyclables.", "created_utc": 1684039809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h2w5z/aita_yelling_at_my_wife_for_not_getting_rid_of/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keeping things that have sentimental value isn\u2019t the same as hoarding. \n\nOP says \u201cobviously a ton of things made it into my home.\u201d\n\n\u201cMY home,\u201d not our home. OP, YTA for being a dictator, not considering the house hers as well, and for yelling at her so much. You are a huge AH. \n\nShould she get rid of lots of that stuff? Absolutely. When she\u2019s ready. You don\u2019t get to decide when that is. She does. And frankly, you making her so defensive about it will likely make her hang onto things way longer than she might have otherwise.", "YTA because it\u2019s seems your only reaction is to yell. Instead of trying to help her or talk to her you yell. And you get upset because she is hurt/scared of your yelling. She has a problem and it\u2019s not unreasonable for you to want to do something about it, but yelling at her, I assure you, it\u2019s not the solution. You asked if you\u2019re TA for yelling? Yes, you\u2019re a giant AH", "You need to stop yelling. You're not solving anything, just creating more trauma around the belongings that she already has issues with. The more you attack her, the more that she's going to hang on to the physical items that she sees as lifelines, and this absolutely will destroy your marriage if you keep going like this.", "She desperately needs therapy, please avail yourselves to seeking outside help", "It\u2019s a shame you let it get to the point where you yell and it frustrates you.  You both probably need therapy at this point.", "YTA, but I do really feel for you. Having a hoarder on your life is extremely difficult, especially living with one, and I can completely understand why you would snap.\n\nMy MIL is also a hoarder and I find it difficult to be in her space just for visits, and I almost lost my shit on her last year when we had to move her and we spent 3 weekends moving nothing but junk (not throwing it away, unfortunately). It was challenging not to react negatively during that time, especially because there was a 6-month lead up to the move and I offered to help her purge and pack countless times\u2026 but it was just too overwhelming for her, which unfortunately resulted in a 1-day job becoming a 6-day job\u2026 and yeah, when I was handed a literal drawer of old wall calendars dating back to the 90\u2019s and told to pack it in the truck\u2026 I was screaming inside.\n\nBut yelling at her is not the answer and it isn\u2019t for you either. You need to be gentle and understanding.\n\nMy MIL finally agreed to let us come help her go through everything during our holidays in August\u2026 so it took some time, but now there\u2019s a plan in place. If I would have yelled at her or been condescending to her, though, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d had ever trusted us to help her with this now that she\u2019s ready.\n\nYou\u2019re not doing yourself or your wife any favours by yelling, so YTA in this situation.", "NTA. I\u2019ve known a hoarder and they won\u2019t be talked to or reasoned with and they always have their sob story excuses. Tell your wife it\u2019s therapy or divorce and be clear the therapy will be about letting go of the junk", "YTA", "YTA. Sir, your wife needs professional help. Losing her mom obviously deeply traumatized her, and she never processed the loss. Hoarding behavior is a symptom of PTSD, usually caused by trauma of sudden loss and a lack of emotional support. You're a huge jerk, get your wife some real help. Damn.", "ESH.  Yelling at her fixes nothing and helps nothing.  However if she's never gotten therapy for these issues then she's a bit of an asshole too.  Mental illness is the reason for her hoard but it isn't an excuse her affecting y'all's homelike to that extent. \n\nI get the feeling everyone who is on here refusing to hold your wife accountable for the hoard has  never lived with a hoarder. Living with a hoarder is a unquiely traumatizing experience...", "If you are about to move, you need a quick fix.  Can't you get her to agree to hiring enough storage facilities in her name so she is responsible for paying the costs.  That way it is out of your house, After that, you can help her look at therapy.  Also what does she think will happen to all this stuff in the future?  My MIL was a horder and it took me weeks of my life to empty her house, it is unfair to leave this junk to other people to deal with.", "YTA and I hope to God that she divorces you. You are vile.", "ESH, mainly yta. You can't scream at her eveeytime you find a bin you know about and expect her to be okay and to have a conversation with you. Especially if you want her comfortable enough to reduce what she has. But don't you dare try to make her get rid of all of it. But I genuinely find her less of an ah than you even if she I genuinely believe she needs to  either find a better place to store all of these or donate and get rid of some of it. At least some of the old papers she doesn't need at all. And don't get rid of stuff for her! Let her decide what to get rid of. Her stepmom not only tried to throw away everything this is all of her mom she has left. She isn't just doing it because she likes the stuff. She misses her mother fro crying out loud and you're not helping at all. St this point she probably feels more comfort and safety with her mom's stuff than you I'm sorry. I understand she has too much and needs to deal with some of it. But the approach is cruel and unempathetic. You cannot yell at her continuously over every bin you find and know about one after the other and expect her to listen to you or not be emotional.", "Why are you in a relationship with someone you don\u2019t respect and constantly yell at. You seem like a mean person and she needs therapy. So glad im not in a relationship like this.", "NTA, but you could have handled it better. I'm a small hoarder myself and have sentiments for every little thing, from report cards from kindergarten to broken toys. And it's very hard to let go of these things. Better start talking to her, calmly of course, and reason with her as to why it's bad or irritating you and start clearing out the least sentimental things.", "ESH. Just for yelling. You're right, she needs to get rid of her old stuff for sure. And she's causing a HUGE problem. But help her get therapy or divorce her if you cant handle it. My mother was a hoarder. I can't describe the hell my life was because of it. The shame..and no matter what I did or said, she kept doing it. So I left as soon as I turned 18 and went LC until she decided to get help. Sometimes all you can do is walk away if they aren't willing to listen or get help. Best of luck OP. Hoarding is a monster. A literal huge, gaping monster that swallows your entire life if nothing is done about it.", "I see quite a few say YTA but geez, you aren\u2019t a therapist or mental health professional!  She has been in your life for 5 years and you probably watched her fill up every single nook and cranny in what was your house until it is busting at the seams.. maybe you have had numerous conversations and you finally blew up. I don\u2019t think it went from nothing to yelling, but you need to take the advice of many here and get her help. You couldn\u2019t help your frustration but you CAN help your actions from here forward. If your marriage can be saved then seek help for her. She won\u2019t know how to, or she will refuse to acknowledge she needs it.. if your marriage can\u2019t be saved then start divorce proceedings but be patient and help her get her things moved to storage units so she can hopefully have family intervene and help her.\nBottom line, she definitely needs a mental health intervention of some sort. And you have obviously felt unheard, and have felt a total lack of control over your living situation so you also need to talk to someone and rebalance yourself and your feelings for your wife.", "My husband has his mothers wedding dress and his fathers pay stubs from the 1940\u2019s in our basement. He hung in to so much of his parents stuff that I don\u2019t have room for any of my own stuff. This is why I know he will never leave me.

I hope next time you yell she does something about it.", "Definitely not the AH. She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t just throw all that crap away. You must really love her to put up with it", "NTA.  People can only take so much. Sounds like your reaching your limits. This is not going to change. Not without some serious therapy or a divorce.", "NTA but your wife is disgusting. Get a new one", "Your wife needs help. This is a mental health condition. NTA.", "YTA, for getting too angry.   \n\nThe thing we learn slowly is that \u201cthis handwritten note is not my mother\u201d, or \u201cthis birthday card is not my mother\u201d. \n\nGood luck with approaching your beloved with tenderness and patience.", "YTA but I get it. \n\nMy husband was exhibiting hoarding behaviors, and we had to sit down and talk about it. We\u2019re in the process of moving, and I\u2019ve just found a bunch of useless stuff he hasn\u2019t parted with (junk mail from previous addresses, broken ceiling fans). \n\nIt helps me, and might help you, to remember that this is likely partly a psychological issue. For your wife, it\u2019s about the connection to her mother. \n\nMy grandparents and aunts died when I was young, and I don\u2019t have a mother. So, I have a bunch of their stuff. But I limit it to: stuff I\u2019ll use (jewelry), stuff I can hang in the wall (grandmother\u2019s paintings), books, and one box of random stuff. \n\nYour wife should see a therapist for her grief. That might help her let go of stuff. But, if she\u2019s not willing to meet you halfway (e.g., donate the purses rather than throw them out; keep some number of boxes) then you have to decide how you want to live in the future. \n\nSolidarity.", "OP it sounds like an incredibly overwhelming amount of stuff. Maybe it\u2019s a mixture of missing mom and not knowing how to start. \n\nShe needs help. Maybe you can hire someone to help. Maybe you both can tackle on him at a time. \n\nYTA for the way you are approaching this. Yelling at her is not going to solve anything. It\u2019ll just make her defensive and hurt her.", "As someone with family that is hoarders ESH I get feeling frustrated by the huge piles of meaningless (to you) stuff and that it all seems a huge mess but yelling at them doesn't fix the problem. Never worked on any of my relatives it just made the hoarding worse. You have to try therapy most likely some sort of anxiety medication maybe depression as well. It also helps to communicate with them (not yell) do you need the bank statements if you already have letters with her handwriting? What are something's that are okay to give away (sometimes being able to imagine the stuff being used by a friend or other relative helps them let things go) or even get rid of? She also needs to want to get help especially if it's causing someone else she cares about so much stress and is affecting their way of living.", "YTA - your wife is obviously having a mental health issue around her mom\u2019s death, her father being so quick to remarry etc. She needs therapy to deal with the hoarding.

Your wife has a hoarding problem and needs professional help. Your logic here is not going to get through to her. These things are her treasure and your anger will not change that.
