It started about 10 years ago when her mom passed away.  Her father remarried very quickly, within 9 months of his wife\u2019s passing.  My wife struggled with this and especially hated the stepmom because she was cleaning out the fathers house of all the deceased wife\u2019s stuff.  My wife wanted all of it.  We weren\u2019t together then but she said it took weeks of car trips just loading up old stuff.\n\nThe stuff included literally everything from my wife\u2019s entire life.  Her mom must\u2019ve never trashed anything.\n\nMy wife filled up 2 storage units with old bins.  Not just pictures and jewelry.  We have most of her moms old clothes.  Every school art project since 1990.  There are 100 lbs of beanie babies.  There are bins of just plastic junk like pencil cases, mugs, old bills and bank statements.  My wife wants mementos of her mom and doesn\u2019t trash documents with her moms hand writing.\n\nWe are moving in 5 weeks and we have an excess of bins everywhere.  With the exception of clothes, kitchen appliances, etc, my other personal stuff is like 5-8 \u201cbins.\u201d  My childhood stuff is 1 bin.  My wife has probably over 100.  We spent all day moving 40-50 bins from the basement to garage in anticipation of moving. \n\nShe has bins in the powder room shower.  Bins in every closet.  Bins in the attic.  There might be over 30 bins of just Christmas decorations.\n\nThe living spaces are clear and free.  But all closets and storage areas are packed.\n\nNow here is the actual \u201cAITA.\u201d  I\u2019ve been getting fed up with this shit.  She moved in 5 years ago and this was an issue.  I pressured her to reduce and she did get rid of stuff.  But obviously a ton made it into my home.  \n\nI get angry and eventually yell.  I yelled at her and told her it\u2019s all meaningless shit and bank records with her moms handwriting wasn\u2019t important since she has other stuff with her handwriting.  I yelled that she has a bin of 10 purses that were her moms and she will never use any of them since they\u2019ve been untouched for 5 years in my house and 10 years since her mom passed.\n\nI yelled some more whenever I find a useless bin with items she\u2019ll never use.  It\u2019s a trigger now for both of us.  I want shit gone and she is devastated to part with any of it and directs that sentiment towards me.  \u201cI\u2019m making her\u201d is how she view it.\n\nShe has this protective shield excuse of \u201cmy mom died.\u201d  And when I yell, she gets defensive at first but then acts like the hurt puppy dog.  She barely talks to me, she\u2019s cold and short.  Overall unpleasant interactions for a couple days.\n\nThings return to normal until next week when I trip over a bin of seashells and old sandals trying to dump our recyclables.", "created_utc": 1684039809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h2w5z/aita_yelling_at_my_wife_for_not_getting_rid_of/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Losing a parent is hard, and while I believe your frustrations are extremely valid can you really understand the pain she must be feeling. Instead of telling her those things are useless and meaningless (which I\u2019m sure for the average person they are) maybe you could have suggested therapy or asked help from other family members to help her go through things and get rid of stuff that hold little to no value.

Ask about therapy but I also want you to listen to your wife when she talks, about her feelings and how she is struggling with the loss of her mum.
