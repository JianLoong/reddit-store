This is the first time we have met each other in five years, and it\u2019s been difficult spending so much time together in close quarters.

Needless to say, this is probably their last visit with us, and likely their last opportunity to spend some time with their grandchild for the next 1-2 years. Was watching a TV show where two siblings go to great lengths to hurt each other and I turned to tell my parents that my childhood was also ruined because of having to grow up with a mentally ill sister, and I suffered physical and mental abuse. My sister is 8 years older and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder at age 18. She abused me from when I turned about 6-7 right up to age 17, and continued verbal abuse right up into my adulthood. I am 38. \nMy dad immediately started yelling at me to stop blaming me for this because he did his best to protect me and that I am wrong and that I am accusing him of being mentally ill.

Like it was their choice? \n\nYeah YTA.", "Nta but you are 38 and your parents don't accept their failings.\n\nEither drop it and move on or cut them out altogether.\n\nNo need to mention it every so often. It's just starting fights.\n\nI'd be going no contact altogether.", "I understand what you're saying, but really, with you being a parent yourself now you realise how f\\_cking hard stuff is. You try and do something to help one, and then in turn it hurts the other. Sometimes a parent cannot win.\n\nWhen your kids are older you will realise that you didn't get it right either, despite the fact you feel you did better than your parents.\n\nAnd really - managing a child with mental health issues is difficult. You keep one away from committing suicide, only to have the other one do it as they didn't get the attention required.\n\nParenting is hard. Get therapy for yourself and let your parents think about all the stuff that has happened and that they no doubt regret, but can no longer change. No-one is perfect.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA for just casually mentioning this while watching tv. You obviously have the right to tell them how your sister\u2019s behaviour made you feel, but why didn\u2019t you sit them down and explain carefully? Their response probably would have been better too if you didn\u2019t lash out without warning.", "NTA but your parents aren't going to give you what you want here. They're defensive because they know they didn't do a good enough job at keeping you safe and they can't tolerate it. \n\nYou said in another comment that you're gaslit every time you bring it up, so I get why you feel the desire to raise it again and again - you want to be validated. You deserve that, and you aren't going to get it from them. That sucks, and it's extremely unlikely to change. \n\nI highly recommend reading The book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. It will help you to find a way to process all of this so you can get the good that remains in your relationship with your parents, without this wound getting reopened so often and ending up with salt in it when they invariably dismiss your feelings. You deserve better but they aren't capable of giving that to you so you gotta find it somewhere else", "Fair.", "There was. I\u2019ve always been gaslit when I bring it up.", "I meant they should have shielded her better. The timing was really bad though"]}
