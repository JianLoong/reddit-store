Like it was their choice? \n\nYeah YTA.", "Nta but you are 38 and your parents don't accept their failings.\n\nEither drop it and move on or cut them out altogether.\n\nNo need to mention it every so often. It's just starting fights.\n\nI'd be going no contact altogether.", "I understand what you're saying, but really, with you being a parent yourself now you realise how f\\_cking hard stuff is. You try and do something to help one, and then in turn it hurts the other. Sometimes a parent cannot win.\n\nWhen your kids are older you will realise that you didn't get it right either, despite the fact you feel you did better than your parents.\n\nAnd really - managing a child with mental health issues is difficult. You keep one away from committing suicide, only to have the other one do it as they didn't get the attention required.\n\nParenting is hard. Get therapy for yourself and let your parents think about all the stuff that has happened and that they no doubt regret, but can no longer change. No-one is perfect.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA for just casually mentioning this while watching tv. You obviously have the right to tell them how your sister\u2019s behaviour made you feel, but why didn\u2019t you sit them down and explain carefully? Their response probably would have been better too if you didn\u2019t lash out without warning.", "NTA but your parents aren't going to give you what you want here. They're defensive because they know they didn't do a good enough job at keeping you safe and they can't tolerate it. \n\nYou said in another comment that you're gaslit every time you bring it up, so I get why you feel the desire to raise it again and again - you want to be validated. You deserve that, and you aren't going to get it from them. That sucks, and it's extremely unlikely to change. \n\nI highly recommend reading The book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. It will help you to find a way to process all of this so you can get the good that remains in your relationship with your parents, without this wound getting reopened so often and ending up with salt in it when they invariably dismiss your feelings. You deserve better but they aren't capable of giving that to you so you gotta find it somewhere else", "Fair.", "There was. I\u2019ve always been gaslit when I bring it up.", "I meant they should have shielded her better. The timing was really bad though", "It sounds like they may have heard this from you before in which case it does sound like you are blaming him. If he did try to protect you then maybe telling them it sucked growing up like that but your glad he was there to protect you when he could would be a better way to think about it. I assume he had to work to pay bills and feed you all. Where was your mom? Why isn't she taking any responsibility? Also 30 years ago there was much fewer options to get help for a mentally ill child.", "INFO, what do you think they should have done?", "NTA. The wounds run deep and they are still bleeding. Your parents obviously didn't or couldn't protect you from your sister. They should have apologized at this meeting but instead got defensive and blew up into a rage. \n\nI expect that either your parents suffer a great deal of guilt for what they know occurred or are blowing off the damage you suffered, trying to pretend that you didn't suffer as much as you did. You probably know which one they are doing.\n\nPerhaps your approach could have been different, less accusatory, but I am sure your emotions run close to the surface even after so many years. Watching a program that brings it all back makes you relive it in the moment. \n\nI suggest getting therapy to help with coping with your PTSD. Time really doesn't make the memories fade. The professional might give some coping skills so your memories don't spoil your remaining years.", "Your parents clearly fucked up with your childhood, but that was partially due to a difficult position they were put in outside of their control. And for you, the timing is terrible here.\n\nThis also won\u2019t give you closure; you said that previous mentions also have yielded no positive results. These types of people never want to admit what they did is wrong, so by bringing this up it\u2019s something that damages both parties with no gain. If you think your parents are so awful that you don\u2019t care about that outcome and want to mar what is potentially your last time time with them then that\u2019s fine, but then I can\u2019t understand why you had them to stay in the first place if you think so poorly of them.\n\nSo I think this is ESH, then more than you because you\u2019ve clearly been hurt\u2014I just can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to accomplish here other than to hurt 3 people (yourself included) in different ways.", "Soft yta. It was poor timing to just bring this up out of the blue. Also my sister has borderline personality disorder there is only so much we could do, her crap literally affects all of us sometimes and the only way to deal with it is to cut back on contact. Which when you were kids would have been impossible for the parents. However they should've have been more supportive once you all were older. \nFor example if my sister has an episode I just don't talk to her for a few days or so until she's back into a proper state of mind.", "NTA. But, definitely bad-timing and out-of-leftfield. Your feelings about your experience are valid, but best expressed through psychotherapy first, before involving your parents. You'll never know if they did their best, or if they wilfully neglected you, so get comfortable with that. It might be worth an apology, to smooth things over for now. Please see a therapist though, that's a fair share of childhood trauma to still be carrying.", "NTA for telling them that you suffered but...\n\nYTA for doing it at that specific moment, out of the blue (triggered by a tv-show and not by a comment during conversation). There must have been dozens of moments in the past to have done this, but the timing was really hurtful.", "NTA\u2026maybe not the best way to communicate what you felt but NTA and I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you", "Info: what were you trying to achieve with this? Did you think he'd feel better after you told him? Do you feel better now? \n\nI had a mentally ill child. It was horrible for all of us. We did the best we could.

What do you think your father should have done?", "NTA\n\nThey failed to protect their child from an abusive sibling. Mine are the same, but as far as I'm aware there's no diagnosis to explain my brother's behaviour, he's just always been like that and I'm expected to \"suck it up, he's your brother!\" I'm told to get over myself, that it was the past, stop creating drama.\n\nSorry, but as a parent, I see how you failed to protect your child.", "NTA, maybe not the best timing, but if they refuse to see how they failed you, maybe it's time to cut them out?", "NTA, but in my experience, parents are never open to that conversation. You have every right to voice your frustration. I am sorry that happened to you.", "Ugh, I have to say a soft NTA. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located or your parents are from, but I grew up in a culture where mental health issues weren\u2019t publicly spoken about. \n\nWith that said, my mom has bipolar disorder and growing up as an only child was\u2026 extremely difficult. She was successful, brilliant, but in her manic phases, completely off the rails. She would threaten to take both hers and my life. Suffice to say it left a lot of scars and for a very long time, we had a terrible relationship. \n\nAs I became an adult, with my own career and mental health journey, I unpacked a lot of the damage left from my childhood and teenage years. And my mom became properly medicated and also sought the route of therapy. We now have an actually very good relationship. There are occasional bad days, but we both choose to walk away from the conflict and we are almost always able to resolve the issue a few days later when emotions aren\u2019t as high.\n\nA big part of that was both of us consciously moving on from the past. I\u2019ve told her that it\u2019s not that I forgive her, because I don\u2019t know that I can ever find that peace. But I want her in my life, and in order to make that happen, I have to accept that I cannot understand her struggles at that time. Do I really think she had malicious intent? No, but to a child, it didn\u2019t matter, the scars are there. And if I continue to have an accusatory tone and resentment towards her for a time that was extremely difficult for all of us, we would never be able to move forward. \n\nI suspect that while your parents weren\u2019t the ones with the mental health issues, they feel similarly to my mom. I know she struggles with extreme guilt for not being able to protect me from her manic phases, and I know seeing my own mental and emotional scars from her actions hurts her so much. Constantly bringing up their failures in what was likely a very shit situation for your entire family doesn\u2019t help anyone move forward, it just continually anchors you all in a place of pain. \n\nYou\u2019re 38, yes, it sucks that you have childhood trauma from dealing with an immediate family member with major mental health struggles, but if you continue to anchor in that trauma, you are going to be the AH. As an adult you have the choice to seek therapy to work through that trauma so you can move forward. If you choose not to, then that\u2019s on you. And likely, not moving forward will only continue to bleed resentment into all aspects of your life.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an AH, but come on. Knowing that this is likely their last visit with you, why would you bring this up?", "NTA. They failed you as parents, turned a blind eye to your abuse and clearly have no remorse for any of it. And fuck all the people saying it was \"bad timing\" or to just \"let it go\". It's always a \"bad time\" to call out your abusers because they never want to face the consequences of their actions. Fuck being gentle and diplomatic with them, you deserve to be heard. \n\nIt might be time to let them go. They don't care about the impact they've had on your life. They don't deserve your energy or consideration.

The timing for this discussion could have been better.", "> Like it was their choice?\n\n[There is a strong correlation between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD.[83][84][85] Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated.[86] Patients with BPD have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either sex. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently.[88] Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver or abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#Developmental_factors)\n\n>My dad immediately started yelling at me to stop blaming me for this\n\nNo further questions your honor.", "What timing would be good though? They don't want to hear about the abuse you suffered growing up, they have probably never wanted to hear about it, and you can either bring it up now or leave everything unsaid as they sweep it all under the carpet.\n\nIf they cannot even discuss this, do you want a relationship with them?", "Why do you keep in contact with them? They are more harm to you (and your child) then good.", "I understand this feeling. Then it just vomits out at the worst times for me.", "THANK YOU! I'm so sick of people making excuses for parents who don't protect their kids from their other kids.", "You really have no idea what your talking about.  I have been both the person being abused and have had children in this same situation.  There are many many situations where no matter what happens, you can't stop it.\n\nDo you just believe the 1 or the other every time?  Who do you trust?  How do you know 1 of them isn't making it up? What if they are hiding it from you?  Maybe the oldest is really good at hiding it and you and nobody around you ever sees it but the younger one keeps telling you they are being bullied?  Do you punish the older one with no Proof?   When you ask, what if they say it didn't happen?  Now you have to decide which one is lying.  What if they are both lying? What if the younger one thinks it's bullying but it's not really.  What if they never tell you?\n\nWhat happens when it's while your at work and you can't afford a \"proper\" babysitter? Do you get the older one to stop babysitting?  If so how do you afford it when you couldn't to begin with?  What do you do with the abuser then?  What if the new \" you can't afford\" baby sitter can't stop them from doing it either?\n\nHow do you know it's not just siblings being siblings and one of them is just taking it too personal?  What if OP is just remembering things incorrectly after all these years? Exaggerating it?  My daughter swears up and down that she raised her siblings for like 10 years.  She didn't even start watching them until she was 12 and only for 2 years and only for an hour a day.  But to her, that was \"raising\" them. I went to work at 5 and the ex got home at 6 maybe 6:30 if traffic was bad and I know they weren't lying cause I could see when she got there on the security cameras.\n\nWhat happens when you do know it's true, and you do everything you can to prevent it but the one that is bullying just won't stop?  Is there a point where you just give up and give them up for adoption? Juvi?  If it gets to that point, then your younger one has already been abused, a lot and you've tried and tried to stop it.\n\n\"it was their choice to LET one child abuse the other\"  Whatever...", "Sister was definitely the AH for hurting her.

OP had 20 years to bring it up, but he waited?", "Given their ages op will be going nc soon anyways", "When your children someday come to you to discuss this, I hope you're less defensive and more apologetic.  It'll save at least six months from the years of therapy they'll each need, not having to unpack why you don't take responsibility for allowing them to be hurt on top of everything else.\n\nI remember an Oprah special in which the parents kept separate households for the violent child and the targeted child, so the latter wasn't terrorized his entire childhood.  They then split time, alternating, with their children.  It's the only viable solution.  Just assuming one is lying so don't worry about it?  No.", "You are so defensive because you know you didn\u2019t do great with your kids. Sorry but it\u2019s not normal to leave a 12 year old on her own at home, but more, to look after your other kids??? If you can\u2019t afford babysitter, don\u2019t have kids. You can\u2019t expect your kids to look after each other. This is not normal. Apologise to your daughter and stop with your excuses. \nIf your kids don\u2019t get along, go to therapy together. There are ways to do that.\n\nIn the end, we are all humans and make mistakes. But what makes good parents is the ability to listen  and apologise. Tell them that you overestimated your capabilities of taking care of them, and you are sorry. And you love them. That\u2019s all they probably need now", "You can avoid leaving the bully and victim alone: they can go to a friend's house, or the bullied child can have a friend come over which should provide some protection. After school activities also provide some moments of safety. You won't be able to stop all the bullying, but a parent can really mitigate it. Even if you give up persuading your bully child to be good person, there are still things you can do.", "I think that depends. Maybe her sister didn\u2019t know what she was doing was wrong, or in her mind she was playing or engaging with her sister? I don\u2019t know. Our minds are completely different and it\u2019s impossible to know with the given info. \nBut yes I agree mental illness is not an excuse but you can\u2019t blame someone for the wrong if they can\u2019t comprehend their own actions.\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion!", "The mother is only 71 - chances are she's got at least another 15 years to go.", "She had bpd, they\u2019re usually aware that being violent is not ok.

Or they can't accept that their family wasn't perfect. Or that your sister was not a perfect child. \n\nYour feelings are absolutely valid. They may not accept them, and you can only choose how to move on from here. You may left everything behind and love the parents you have today, or you may choose to put specific boundaries to avoid any further suffering, like low contact or no contact. You can just refuse to talk about your childhood and your sister and just be with your parents. Whatever you choose, it's up to you.", "Personally, I\u2019d say NTA.

True, the life expectancy for women in the US is just under 80 years (dropped slightly during Covid) but that's at birth. (I looked the figures up on the CDC website). That life expectancy includes the possibility of dying way earlier, e.g. an accident during childhood, death during childbirth, an overdose, cancer at 45 years old...you get the picture. It's an average. \n\nHowever when you've made it to a certain age the life expectancy for that age group is no longer the original average expectancy, but higher.

They were 2 clueless people with little to no help and their hands full.

But it might make you feel better to talk to someone about this, not to forgive them, but to let that anger go.", "**NTA**\n\nFirstly, I am sorry this happened to you. I am so sorry you had to go through what you did. I cannot imagine it was easy for any of you with a sibling/daughter with those diagnoses. None the less, they had a duty of care towards you. Their job was to protect you, to nurture you, to make you feel safe, secure, loved. They clearly, good intetions or otherwise, failed in this duty. You've said there being sexual abuse as well but not said by whom. I've read through your comments and it seems you've done a lot of work on understanding what happened. But, validly so, the child in you wants an apology. Wants them to understand the hurt.\n\nThe way you describe the incident and based on your comments it seems that you did not make it clear what you wanted from the interaction. You've explicitly said in the comments that you wanted an apology or aknowledgement of how tough it was on you. How unfair it was. You did not get that. Instead, you told your parents your childhood was ruined, and they took that as a personal attack. It sounds like the communication broke down swiftly as they reverted and you reverted to previous versions of yourselves. \n\nNow for the important bit. Your parents are nearing the last phase of their life. You may be choice or by ill fortune never see them again. They flew half way around the world to see you and your kids. Are they the same people they were back then? Irrespective of not having had the therapy to gain insight and having done the required introspection are they the same? If yes, you're 38 years old, cut them out. If not ask yourself, was this really the moment to bring this up? Was it the moment to, after not seeing them for years to push this issue. It is entirely valid if the answer is yes and you needed to leave nothing unsaid. That is an entirely reasonable need, want, ask that, if they cannot handle, it is best you part ways. If you feel your kids knowing them, you knowing them again, spending some time with them as an adult is more important then maybe try and diffuse. You are NTA here and there are no wrong or right answers. Once things cool down however, if you have no closure, I would suggest thinking if there was a different approach to communicate what you were hoping to receive from them. \n\nGood luck OP this one broke my heart. It sounds like you made a wonderful life for yourself though. Well done.", "NTA and your feelings are valid. Your timing sucked and you might want to show some empathy to your parents. 30 years ago, mental health and associated illnesses were not spoken about. There wasn't the help out there that there is now. Your sister most likely terrorised the whole household, not just you, and as parents, I imagine they were torn apart, wanting to help her and protect you.", "NTA\n\nBut I would suggest a therapist to help you unpack your childhood and help develop some strategies to move forwards if there are triggering events.\n\nYour father was in the wrong with how he reacted to your words.  He should've apologised and validated your feelings but he didn't.  Not sure if that's guilt or the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in your older sister but he's better at masking... but less good now that he's getting older.\n\nThe difficult thing for your parent is that you are all their children.  And there are expectations when the kids are under age  that you actually care for them.  It's not as easy as saying just get rid of the problem child.  In fact in CPS cases where an older child is quite abusive to the rest of the family (say 14/15 as an age), that CPS would rather take the younger children as it's easier to get foster homes for them rather than the usually older, problem child.  \n\nBut the difficulty is that you feel like you are sacrificing a child or two for the problem child.  Sometimes you do your best to set up boundaries and you don't tolerate a lot... but it's hard to shield other kids when someone is having a meltdown and even if they are nowhere near them it's still a trigger because they do have PTSD, even if it's just from the yelling... much less anything else that goes on.\n\nI hope that all the kids got some sort of counselling but I suspect not.", "NTA, but you have no tact. And it seems like you're not going to get what you want from them. I would instead recommend therapy. Where you can have your feelings validated and where you can work through this.", "NTA! While my initial thought was that the timing may have been abrupt, there's no right time to have that conversation and it sounds like you've already tried several times before. It isn't easy for anyone to acknowledge that their actions or lack of action has hurt someone close to them, but if they care about the relationship with you they need to push through their discomfort to recognize your pain and apologize for their part in it.\n\nI grew up kinda similarly with an abusive older sister (4 years older) who was originally diagnosed as Bipolar and later Borderline. I always thought that it was just normal to be bullied by your siblings and that I just got it worse than my friends. I didn't even know sibling abuse was a thing until I started therapy last year, started diving into some of my issues, and came across a Psychology Today article called \"Sibling Bullying and Abuse: The Hidden Epidemic\". \n\nI've had a few conversations with my parents since then about how I feel like they didn't protect me enough from her and how unfair it was to put me in a sort of monitor situation to keep track of my older sister as she went wild in highschool. I could tell the conversation made them uncomfortable, and they had excuses but those led to us discussing their thought processes at the time and how they were wrong. It hurt them to hear how they messed up and caused me pain, but they apologized and that's what you should expect from the people in your life who claim to love you. \n\nIt's entirely up to you if you want to keep trying to broach the subject with them, but if they don't start to acknowledge their part I would consider going LC with them just for your own mental well-being.", "NTA. That's your dad's guilt speaking there. Talk about victim blaming. I've had a similar exchange with my mom when I (36F) told her that my dad's alcoholism ruined my childhood and the family life we could have had. My mom snapped at me that I always \"got what I wanted\" and what else could I need?? And I said that I'd be an idiot to refuse my dad's 'providing' for his family as a minor, but that doesn't mean I condoned the abuse! Sure, we had a roof over our heads, clothes, got a university education... But home life was S*IT. Really, really sh*t! My mom always stayed with my dad because she felt guilty leaving him, even though she also received her share of emotional abuse...  But she lashed out at me (victim) because the only one with any power to protect us or remove us from that situation was my mom, and she chose to stay and defend my dad. Hearing now that we kids were in pain is something she struggles to take in.\n\n(Flash forward, they are on the brink of divorce now.)\n\nAnyways - it's guilt. You were a minor, and your parents clearly don't like hearing about your sister's mental illness your perspective. \n\nI'm sorry OP,  but sometimes we actually sadly just can't talk to our parents about the abuse we suffered as kids - not that we shouldn't try... But they want to bury things in the past where we want to talk about them honestly and openly to be able to move on.\n\nYou are NTA at all... But I don't really think anyone is the AH here. It's just a sad situation and I hope you are able to have an open, honest and non-hostile conversation with your parents about your lived reality one day.", "NTA, we can be traumatized by a lot as children and as someone who had an abusing Bipolar brother I understand. How your parents SHOULD have reacted was, \"I'm sorry\". Even though it's not always their fault the parent shouldn't start screaming at you because you have trauma. I would recommend low to no contact with them, it sounds like they're just going to gaslight you into believing you're wrong.

There are situations where it can't be prevented no matter how good of a parent you are, there are times where things can happen right under your nose and you not know it or not know how to deal with it.", "My point was \"allowing abuse is a choice\" is not as black and white as that person was making it out to be.  I do NOT CONDONE abuse at all.  \n\nHowever, not everything that happens the parent knows about and then there are situations where you can't even stop it without taking extreme actions and not everyone can afford after school activities, or has friends they can send their kids to or have anyone that can watch them.  I'm not saying don't do anything, I'm saying it can't be avoided or prevented in all households, all the time.", "It's not normal to have a sibling babysit? What world did you grow up in?  It is completely normal to have a sibling babysit for an hour or two.  No one said I couldn't afford a sitter, I was giving examples for most of what I said, and for a lot of the rest it's what happened TO ME not my kids.  Yes, my oldest liked to bully her siblings and there were a lot of reasons why but, I'm not getting into it here but we have worked through them.\n\nI talk to my kids all the time about how I'm learning to be a parent like they are learning to grow up.  I apologize when I'm wrong, I ask for their opinions on how they want to deal with things and all sorts of stuff my parents didn't do with me.\n\nI have already apologized to my daughter. I'm not going to even try to argue with her over it, those are her feeling and weather I feel i'm right or not, it's the way she feels so I'm wrong either way.  \n\nMy whole point was when that other person said \"It's a choice\" it's not as clear cut as they are making it out to be.  **I'm not condoning abuse in any form**.  I'm trying to say that there are situations where it can't be prevented and no matter how hard you try as a parent, there are times where it's NOT a choice.", "So that's what you wanted? An apology from your dad? Would that have helped you?", "It certainly sounds like that would have happened if he did try", "Ew my mom left me home alone with my newborn brother at the age of 12 so she could work night shifts. If you can\u2019t afford an actual babysitter then you shouldn\u2019t even be having a kid. I still resent my mom for having a kid when we were already struggling financially. Moms just be lazy. You chose to have the damn kid so watch it yourself.", "Why would they NOT want an apology from their parents? Acknowledging the issue and apologizing is usually step one to be able to move forward from an issue. \nDid YOU ever acknowledge the impact that the mental illness of one of the members of your family had on the family unit? Or is sweeping under the rug your method of choice?", "My daughter not only volunteered for it but we paid her for it.  We were not in a situation where we couldn't afford a sitter.  However 13 years later, she now claims she raised them (watched them for hours on end) when in actuality she had no issues with it at the time.   She didn't have to feed, or change them or do anything other than make sure they didn't kill each other, no cleaning, no cooking, nothing but be there.\n\nI refused to argue with her over this because that's the way she feels and I have no right to tell her how to feel.  I apologized for the whole thing so we could move on as a family.", "Thank you for explaining this so well. \n\nMy rebuttal was going to be 'nuh-uh', but then trying to figure out how to explain why average doesn't mean what they think it means.", "My mom paid me scraps too for raising her child she didn\u2019t have the time or money for. It was never enough for the labor I did. I was basically a secondary parent, felt like a boring single mom who couldn\u2019t hangout with my friends or do after school activities because I had to babysit. I\u2019d would\u2019ve rather had a real job than be stuck babysitting at home. \n\nBut I pretend I enjoyed my life as a kid because my mom didn\u2019t allow me to openly hate my life. She made me feel selfish for not wanting to be around her or my brother on my free days. I just couldn\u2019t wait until I could move out, my mom used me as much as she could.

Haven\u2019t seen your parents in years then watch an abusive tv show \u201cbtw parents my childhood was also abusive\u201d how self adsorbed. There are better ways to have this conversation and by the sound of your dads reaction you bring it up constantly. Time to get therapy. At a certain point we have to move past our trauma or go no contact if it\u2019s too painful. Not seeing your parents in years inviting them out then rehashing trauma with your elderly parents is very juvenile.", "NTA", "NTA. You spoke your truth. I come from an abusive family where everything is secret. To speak openly like that is so hard, and I think you were brave. I'm sorry they reacted defensively.", "NTA for telling them, but you are the A H for the way that you did it. It sounds like they were attacked mid tv episode. If you talk about something like that then you need to plan a healthy way to talk about it. Talk with a therapist first, then from there you sort out the best way to tell them how you feel that does not come across as attacking, but loving and inquisitive. \n\nThe was you describe it, it sounded very cold and aimed at blaming and hurting them. As much as it hurts what you went through, I can guarantee that your parents knew how difficult it was for you and did not know how to handle your sister. Did they try to help you at all? Was your Dad right that he tried to protect you? Try to hear their perspective too. \n\nPlease understand me when I say that I am not minimizing what you went through, as it was a traumatic childhood from the brief bit of information, but I would encourage you to talk to a therapist about it. I am just saying that you could have handled this in a much better way.", "NTA you don't owe them. Things like this should have some sunshine on them. Hiding the truth away means they will never confront what they have done to you by not protecting you. On the other hand, you have to know that they won't apologise so you know that you are going to cause a fight every time you bring it up. Still NTA IMO", "YTA\n\nI do not disagree that your childhood was tough but did you see a real need to bring this up? Or was this just some spite because you don't like spending time and money with them?", "YTA, but more for attributing your sister\u2019s abusive behaviour to her mental health issues. Plenty of people have one or both of those conditions, and while they have their own struggles, are not abusive to others. Abusing others is a choice that some people make, regardless of mental health. \nYour parents had an obligation to address the abuse, so you\u2019re not wrong about that.", "I\u2019d say it just wasn\u2019t an appropriate time to bring up the past. As someone with severe childhood trauma from my parents I choose not to talk to them and haven\u2019t for years because they would never admit fault and it hurts. On the other hand of the argument I myself am a mother of 3 children. My oldest son has autism and sometimes isn\u2019t the kindest to his little brothers in correlation to his autism. He can get physical at times. As a parent of course I reprimand him and avoid it at all costs but there are times where it isn\u2019t as easy to avoid. My husband works full time and I stay home. While I\u2019m making dinner is a certain time it is unavoidable. I try everything in my powder to avoid but sometimes it\u2019s impossible. Believe me when I tell you they didn\u2019t have it easy either with your sister\u2019s mental illness. My feelings are hurt almost daily by the awful things he says and does, not to mention the countless school, doctor and therapy appointments. I\u2019m trying everything I can in hopes it will get better in the future. Maybe this isn\u2019t the case with your parents. I\u2019m just sharing from a mother that deals with this type of thing daily. You\u2019re not an asshole. I just don\u2019t think it was the right time and I also don\u2019t think you\u2019re willing or able to view things from your parents perspective.", "NTA", "NTA, because both can be true. He thought he did his best to protect you, and you still had a ruined childhood and suffered abuse.

Is he also bipolar?", "NTA, and it is never the wrong time to bring this stuff up. BPD in a family can be  very chaotic and abusive.

I have to be very careful about the way I word things, making sure I never attack her or say anything that can be perceived as an attack. For example in your situation I would have to take it from the angle of these conditions were much less understood (they still barely are even now) back then and support was non existent and I know she tried her best with no resources but that my sibling had hurt me and lost some of the ways, specific examples and explain that it would mean a lot to me that she could understand and realise how difficult my life was due to the situation. She would usually ignore it for a few days but would read it a number of times and fight with herself about it but she usually agrees with me eventually and then I have to make her feel like a bit of a hero for making such a breakthrough.\nThis is a woman who told me I was being stupid because I asked her to stop telling all her friends I had breast cancer when all that had happened was me going for a mammogram and she happened to find my appointment letter.

That is your choice, for me I choose to because I am strong enough to deal with her and in some ways she is an incredibly generous woman along with many good traits that balance the bad. Please remember it is always ok to remove a toxic person not matter how you know them. You are NTA but maybe a letter and allow them to digest it (I don\u2019t ever bring it up until she is ready to broach it with me as I know it has sat in her mind long enough then) might be worth it.
