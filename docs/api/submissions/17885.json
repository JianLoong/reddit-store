Like it was their choice? \n\nYeah YTA.", "Nta but you are 38 and your parents don't accept their failings.\n\nEither drop it and move on or cut them out altogether.\n\nNo need to mention it every so often. It's just starting fights.\n\nI'd be going no contact altogether.", "I understand what you're saying, but really, with you being a parent yourself now you realise how f\\_cking hard stuff is. You try and do something to help one, and then in turn it hurts the other. Sometimes a parent cannot win.\n\nWhen your kids are older you will realise that you didn't get it right either, despite the fact you feel you did better than your parents.\n\nAnd really - managing a child with mental health issues is difficult. You keep one away from committing suicide, only to have the other one do it as they didn't get the attention required.\n\nParenting is hard. Get therapy for yourself and let your parents think about all the stuff that has happened and that they no doubt regret, but can no longer change. No-one is perfect.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA for just casually mentioning this while watching tv. You obviously have the right to tell them how your sister\u2019s behaviour made you feel, but why didn\u2019t you sit them down and explain carefully? Their response probably would have been better too if you didn\u2019t lash out without warning.", "NTA but your parents aren't going to give you what you want here. They're defensive because they know they didn't do a good enough job at keeping you safe and they can't tolerate it. \n\nYou said in another comment that you're gaslit every time you bring it up, so I get why you feel the desire to raise it again and again - you want to be validated. You deserve that, and you aren't going to get it from them. That sucks, and it's extremely unlikely to change. \n\nI highly recommend reading The book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. It will help you to find a way to process all of this so you can get the good that remains in your relationship with your parents, without this wound getting reopened so often and ending up with salt in it when they invariably dismiss your feelings. You deserve better but they aren't capable of giving that to you so you gotta find it somewhere else", "Fair.", "There was. I\u2019ve always been gaslit when I bring it up.", "I meant they should have shielded her better. The timing was really bad though", "It sounds like they may have heard this from you before in which case it does sound like you are blaming him. If he did try to protect you then maybe telling them it sucked growing up like that but your glad he was there to protect you when he could would be a better way to think about it. I assume he had to work to pay bills and feed you all. Where was your mom? Why isn't she taking any responsibility? Also 30 years ago there was much fewer options to get help for a mentally ill child.", "INFO, what do you think they should have done?", "NTA. The wounds run deep and they are still bleeding. Your parents obviously didn't or couldn't protect you from your sister. They should have apologized at this meeting but instead got defensive and blew up into a rage. \n\nI expect that either your parents suffer a great deal of guilt for what they know occurred or are blowing off the damage you suffered, trying to pretend that you didn't suffer as much as you did. You probably know which one they are doing.\n\nPerhaps your approach could have been different, less accusatory, but I am sure your emotions run close to the surface even after so many years. Watching a program that brings it all back makes you relive it in the moment. \n\nI suggest getting therapy to help with coping with your PTSD. Time really doesn't make the memories fade. The professional might give some coping skills so your memories don't spoil your remaining years.", "Your parents clearly fucked up with your childhood, but that was partially due to a difficult position they were put in outside of their control. And for you, the timing is terrible here.\n\nThis also won\u2019t give you closure; you said that previous mentions also have yielded no positive results. These types of people never want to admit what they did is wrong, so by bringing this up it\u2019s something that damages both parties with no gain. If you think your parents are so awful that you don\u2019t care about that outcome and want to mar what is potentially your last time time with them then that\u2019s fine, but then I can\u2019t understand why you had them to stay in the first place if you think so poorly of them.\n\nSo I think this is ESH, then more than you because you\u2019ve clearly been hurt\u2014I just can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to accomplish here other than to hurt 3 people (yourself included) in different ways.", "Soft yta. It was poor timing to just bring this up out of the blue. Also my sister has borderline personality disorder there is only so much we could do, her crap literally affects all of us sometimes and the only way to deal with it is to cut back on contact. Which when you were kids would have been impossible for the parents. However they should've have been more supportive once you all were older. \nFor example if my sister has an episode I just don't talk to her for a few days or so until she's back into a proper state of mind.", "NTA. But, definitely bad-timing and out-of-leftfield. Your feelings about your experience are valid, but best expressed through psychotherapy first, before involving your parents. You'll never know if they did their best, or if they wilfully neglected you, so get comfortable with that. It might be worth an apology, to smooth things over for now. Please see a therapist though, that's a fair share of childhood trauma to still be carrying.", "NTA for telling them that you suffered but...\n\nYTA for doing it at that specific moment, out of the blue (triggered by a tv-show and not by a comment during conversation). There must have been dozens of moments in the past to have done this, but the timing was really hurtful.", "NTA\u2026maybe not the best way to communicate what you felt but NTA and I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you", "Info: what were you trying to achieve with this? Did you think he'd feel better after you told him? Do you feel better now? \n\nI had a mentally ill child. It was horrible for all of us. We did the best we could.

What do you think your father should have done?", "NTA\n\nThey failed to protect their child from an abusive sibling. Mine are the same, but as far as I'm aware there's no diagnosis to explain my brother's behaviour, he's just always been like that and I'm expected to \"suck it up, he's your brother!\" I'm told to get over myself, that it was the past, stop creating drama.\n\nSorry, but as a parent, I see how you failed to protect your child.", "NTA, maybe not the best timing, but if they refuse to see how they failed you, maybe it's time to cut them out?", "NTA, but in my experience, parents are never open to that conversation. You have every right to voice your frustration. I am sorry that happened to you.", "Ugh, I have to say a soft NTA. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located or your parents are from, but I grew up in a culture where mental health issues weren\u2019t publicly spoken about. \n\nWith that said, my mom has bipolar disorder and growing up as an only child was\u2026 extremely difficult. She was successful, brilliant, but in her manic phases, completely off the rails. She would threaten to take both hers and my life. Suffice to say it left a lot of scars and for a very long time, we had a terrible relationship. \n\nAs I became an adult, with my own career and mental health journey, I unpacked a lot of the damage left from my childhood and teenage years. And my mom became properly medicated and also sought the route of therapy. We now have an actually very good relationship. There are occasional bad days, but we both choose to walk away from the conflict and we are almost always able to resolve the issue a few days later when emotions aren\u2019t as high.\n\nA big part of that was both of us consciously moving on from the past. I\u2019ve told her that it\u2019s not that I forgive her, because I don\u2019t know that I can ever find that peace. But I want her in my life, and in order to make that happen, I have to accept that I cannot understand her struggles at that time. Do I really think she had malicious intent? No, but to a child, it didn\u2019t matter, the scars are there. And if I continue to have an accusatory tone and resentment towards her for a time that was extremely difficult for all of us, we would never be able to move forward. \n\nI suspect that while your parents weren\u2019t the ones with the mental health issues, they feel similarly to my mom. I know she struggles with extreme guilt for not being able to protect me from her manic phases, and I know seeing my own mental and emotional scars from her actions hurts her so much. Constantly bringing up their failures in what was likely a very shit situation for your entire family doesn\u2019t help anyone move forward, it just continually anchors you all in a place of pain. \n\nYou\u2019re 38, yes, it sucks that you have childhood trauma from dealing with an immediate family member with major mental health struggles, but if you continue to anchor in that trauma, you are going to be the AH. As an adult you have the choice to seek therapy to work through that trauma so you can move forward. If you choose not to, then that\u2019s on you. And likely, not moving forward will only continue to bleed resentment into all aspects of your life.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an AH, but come on. Knowing that this is likely their last visit with you, why would you bring this up?", "NTA. They failed you as parents, turned a blind eye to your abuse and clearly have no remorse for any of it. And fuck all the people saying it was \"bad timing\" or to just \"let it go\". It's always a \"bad time\" to call out your abusers because they never want to face the consequences of their actions. Fuck being gentle and diplomatic with them, you deserve to be heard. \n\nIt might be time to let them go. They don't care about the impact they've had on your life. They don't deserve your energy or consideration.

The timing for this discussion could have been better.", "> Like it was their choice?\n\n[There is a strong correlation between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD.[83][84][85] Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated.[86] Patients with BPD have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either sex. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently.[88] Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver or abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#Developmental_factors)\n\n>My dad immediately started yelling at me to stop blaming me for this\n\nNo further questions your honor.", "What timing would be good though? They don't want to hear about the abuse you suffered growing up, they have probably never wanted to hear about it, and you can either bring it up now or leave everything unsaid as they sweep it all under the carpet.\n\nIf they cannot even discuss this, do you want a relationship with them?", "Why do you keep in contact with them? They are more harm to you (and your child) then good.", "I understand this feeling. Then it just vomits out at the worst times for me.", "THANK YOU! I'm so sick of people making excuses for parents who don't protect their kids from their other kids.", "You really have no idea what your talking about.  I have been both the person being abused and have had children in this same situation.  There are many many situations where no matter what happens, you can't stop it.\n\nDo you just believe the 1 or the other every time?  Who do you trust?  How do you know 1 of them isn't making it up? What if they are hiding it from you?  Maybe the oldest is really good at hiding it and you and nobody around you ever sees it but the younger one keeps telling you they are being bullied?  Do you punish the older one with no Proof?   When you ask, what if they say it didn't happen?  Now you have to decide which one is lying.  What if they are both lying? What if the younger one thinks it's bullying but it's not really.  What if they never tell you?\n\nWhat happens when it's while your at work and you can't afford a \"proper\" babysitter? Do you get the older one to stop babysitting?  If so how do you afford it when you couldn't to begin with?  What do you do with the abuser then?  What if the new \" you can't afford\" baby sitter can't stop them from doing it either?\n\nHow do you know it's not just siblings being siblings and one of them is just taking it too personal?  What if OP is just remembering things incorrectly after all these years? Exaggerating it?  My daughter swears up and down that she raised her siblings for like 10 years.  She didn't even start watching them until she was 12 and only for 2 years and only for an hour a day.  But to her, that was \"raising\" them. I went to work at 5 and the ex got home at 6 maybe 6:30 if traffic was bad and I know they weren't lying cause I could see when she got there on the security cameras.\n\nWhat happens when you do know it's true, and you do everything you can to prevent it but the one that is bullying just won't stop?  Is there a point where you just give up and give them up for adoption? Juvi?  If it gets to that point, then your younger one has already been abused, a lot and you've tried and tried to stop it.\n\n\"it was their choice to LET one child abuse the other\"  Whatever...", "Sister was definitely the AH for hurting her.

OP had 20 years to bring it up, but he waited?", "Given their ages op will be going nc soon anyways", "When your children someday come to you to discuss this, I hope you're less defensive and more apologetic.  It'll save at least six months from the years of therapy they'll each need, not having to unpack why you don't take responsibility for allowing them to be hurt on top of everything else.\n\nI remember an Oprah special in which the parents kept separate households for the violent child and the targeted child, so the latter wasn't terrorized his entire childhood.  They then split time, alternating, with their children.  It's the only viable solution.  Just assuming one is lying so don't worry about it?  No.", "You are so defensive because you know you didn\u2019t do great with your kids. Sorry but it\u2019s not normal to leave a 12 year old on her own at home, but more, to look after your other kids??? If you can\u2019t afford babysitter, don\u2019t have kids. You can\u2019t expect your kids to look after each other. This is not normal. Apologise to your daughter and stop with your excuses. \nIf your kids don\u2019t get along, go to therapy together. There are ways to do that.\n\nIn the end, we are all humans and make mistakes. But what makes good parents is the ability to listen  and apologise. Tell them that you overestimated your capabilities of taking care of them, and you are sorry. And you love them. That\u2019s all they probably need now", "You can avoid leaving the bully and victim alone: they can go to a friend's house, or the bullied child can have a friend come over which should provide some protection. After school activities also provide some moments of safety. You won't be able to stop all the bullying, but a parent can really mitigate it. Even if you give up persuading your bully child to be good person, there are still things you can do.", "I think that depends. Maybe her sister didn\u2019t know what she was doing was wrong, or in her mind she was playing or engaging with her sister? I don\u2019t know. Our minds are completely different and it\u2019s impossible to know with the given info. \nBut yes I agree mental illness is not an excuse but you can\u2019t blame someone for the wrong if they can\u2019t comprehend their own actions.\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion!", "The mother is only 71 - chances are she's got at least another 15 years to go.", "She had bpd, they\u2019re usually aware that being violent is not ok.

The parents hope that, once their children are grown up, everything will magically be all right, all forgotten and forgiven. \n\nThere may have been many reasons why they refuse to acknowledge your suffering, it may be because they were overwhelmed by your sister's problems and didn't want to deal wit one more problem, so they look the other way.\n\nPerhaps they didn't want to admit that they didn't do their best to help you. Or they can't accept that their family wasn't perfect. Or that your sister was not a perfect child. \n\nYour feelings are absolutely valid. They may not accept them, and you can only choose how to move on from here. You may left everything behind and love the parents you have today, or you may choose to put specific boundaries to avoid any further suffering, like low contact or no contact. You can just refuse to talk about your childhood and your sister and just be with your parents. Whatever you choose, it's up to you.", "Personally, I\u2019d say NTA. There is never a good time to bring this up. They are not going to acknowledge negligence ever. \n\nYou did not have a happy childhood, and it is only natural to feel this effect more now that you are a parent.", "Because they failed to protect op from physical and mental abuse. Because they fail to recognise that there was mistakes made that they have culpability for.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff they can do short of separating both children that falls under the heading of parenting.", "Absolutely. Sometimes it's just for closure. Being gaslighted about suffering is hard. Some parents just can't admit their mistakes.", "It\u2019s not always that simple. If the sister was bipolar with a personality disorder, that\u2019s a very rough combination to deal with and they are figuring it out as they go along. I\u2019m not excusing what sister did. I\u2019m not excusing parents for letting it happen. Sometimes this happens despite best efforts to avoid it. \nMy mother was very much like the sister. It\u2019s really hard to deal with, no matter your relationship.", "Ding ding ding \ud83d\udece\ufe0f", "That doesn\u2019t mean everyone with BPD has been sexually abused.

It doesn\u2019t. You can\u2019t afford childcare, you shouldn\u2019t have had this many children. But you did and it was on you and your ex to find the money to pay for a real babysitter instead of using your child as free labor. Your job, not your daughters. Yours. \n\nAnd who do you believe? You fucking believe both and separate them. You figure it out even if it costs you an arm and a leg. \n\nChildren don\u2019t come with guaranties, having them is a risk. And when it\u2019s hard or you don\u2019t know how, it\u2019s still your job to figure it out. \n\nYour attitude here tells me your daughter absolutely wasn\u2019t exaggerating, and one day you\u2019re going to look back and wonder why none of your children will speak to you or visit you. You\u2019re going to wonder what you did wrong. Come back here and understand. You chose yourself over your child. You took the easy way out. **You selfishly used your 12 year old child to make your life easier.** And that\u2019s inexcusable.", "Thank you! My sister was older and did the best she could being also our mother\u2019s daughter and she tried to protect me. It didn\u2019t work. The only time either of us were at peace was when she was gone.\nMy oldest had a lot of issues before we got her properly medicated. She pulled a knife on her younger sibling while we weren\u2019t home. We were perplexed as we went through it blindly until we were able to get it evened out.\nI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve dealt with this too.", "Oh, please. Not stopping further abuse IS a choice. Not looking into it because you're busy or tired IS a choice. Ignoring it IS a choice.", "Yes, actually. Doesn\u2019t sound like the parents actually did a good job of protecting OP, and if hearing the truth makes them SO upset they\u2019d wanna sacrifice their time with OP and their grandkid\u2026then they likely deserve NC.

Maybe he did and they repeatedly shut him down?", "OP tried to discuss \"The Family Secret\"?  That is Verboten!", "I'm not saying it's right, I'm not condoning abuse.  I'm saying it's not right to say there is a way to completely stop it or prevent it from happening. No matter how hard you try, there are somethings out of your hands.  Some of it can be stopped but some of it can't.  Shit A TON of it can be stopped.  \n\nThat other person was saying that it's a choice and it's not that black and white. You can be the best parent in the world and abuse can happen right under your nose and you not know.\n\nI've been a victim of physical and mental abuse all my childhood, I know all about it and all about how people brush it off or blame you or just down right ignore it but to say it's a choice on the parents part and end it there, is not always correct.", "But once upon a time, that\u2019s how things were.

There\u2019s no winning with her. \n\nI\u2019m impressed your people with BPD are dealing with it and have some self-insight, BPD is basically insecure narcissism.", "That's not quite how it works though. True, the life expectancy for women in the US is just under 80 years (dropped slightly during Covid) but that's at birth. (I looked the figures up on the CDC website). That life expectancy includes the possibility of dying way earlier, e.g. an accident during childhood, death during childbirth, an overdose, cancer at 45 years old...you get the picture. It's an average. \n\nHowever when you've made it to a certain age the life expectancy for that age group is no longer the original average expectancy, but higher. I didn't find federal figures, but according to health.ny.gov, the life expectancy of a 71 year old female is 14.65 years - so 86/87 years of age.", "That is not really how it works. \n\n78 is the average life expectancy of women in the  USA, yes, but that is at *birth*. As in, if she was born right now, statistically she\u2019s be likely to live to 78. \n\nHowever OPs mom is obviously not a newborn. She is already 71. If you\u2019d want to know her life expectancy now, you\u2019d have to actually look up life expectancy at 71, which roughly puts her life expectancy at [88](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/aging/articles/how-to-calculate-your-life-expectancy#:~:text=Consider%20the%20Average%20Life%20Expectancy,-The%20Social%20Security&text=And%20if%20she%20makes%20it,life%20expectancy%20of%2084.1%20years.).\n\nThe reason there is such a large change is Because average life expectancy also takes into account things like childhood death that can heavily skew the end results. But once you have lived past the period of your life where those things are relevant, to get an accurate statistical analysis, those factors should now be excluded. \n\nIt\u2019s the same reason why all those \u2018people in the Middle Ages had an average life expectancy of 35\u2019 factoids present a very skewed picture of the situation. Yes, for a baby that would be the average life expectancy because a lot of children died. But once you got past the dangerous period, you were likely to live for decades more.", "The median age of women in the US is just under 40, so\u2026 not quite.", "I think the key difference is that your sister doesn\u2019t accept the diagnosis, but the people I\u2019m close to fully accept it. They\u2019re also aware that getting violent with people isn\u2019t cool, even if they feel justified in their feelings. There\u2019s a very big difference between the people that feel there\u2019s nothing wrong with them and the ones that are fully understanding that they have a diagnosed disorder.
