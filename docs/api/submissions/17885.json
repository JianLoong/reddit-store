Like it was their choice? \n\nYeah YTA.", "Nta but you are 38 and your parents don't accept their failings.\n\nEither drop it and move on or cut them out altogether.\n\nNo need to mention it every so often. It's just starting fights.\n\nI'd be going no contact altogether.", "I understand what you're saying, but really, with you being a parent yourself now you realise how f\\_cking hard stuff is. You try and do something to help one, and then in turn it hurts the other. Sometimes a parent cannot win.\n\nWhen your kids are older you will realise that you didn't get it right either, despite the fact you feel you did better than your parents.\n\nAnd really - managing a child with mental health issues is difficult. You keep one away from committing suicide, only to have the other one do it as they didn't get the attention required.\n\nParenting is hard. Get therapy for yourself and let your parents think about all the stuff that has happened and that they no doubt regret, but can no longer change. No-one is perfect.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA for just casually mentioning this while watching tv. You obviously have the right to tell them how your sister\u2019s behaviour made you feel, but why didn\u2019t you sit them down and explain carefully? Their response probably would have been better too if you didn\u2019t lash out without warning.", "NTA but your parents aren't going to give you what you want here. They're defensive because they know they didn't do a good enough job at keeping you safe and they can't tolerate it. \n\nYou said in another comment that you're gaslit every time you bring it up, so I get why you feel the desire to raise it again and again - you want to be validated. You deserve that, and you aren't going to get it from them. That sucks, and it's extremely unlikely to change. \n\nI highly recommend reading The book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. It will help you to find a way to process all of this so you can get the good that remains in your relationship with your parents, without this wound getting reopened so often and ending up with salt in it when they invariably dismiss your feelings. You deserve better but they aren't capable of giving that to you so you gotta find it somewhere else", "Fair.", "There was. I\u2019ve always been gaslit when I bring it up.", "I meant they should have shielded her better. The timing was really bad though", "It sounds like they may have heard this from you before in which case it does sound like you are blaming him. If he did try to protect you then maybe telling them it sucked growing up like that but your glad he was there to protect you when he could would be a better way to think about it. I assume he had to work to pay bills and feed you all. Where was your mom? Why isn't she taking any responsibility? Also 30 years ago there was much fewer options to get help for a mentally ill child.", "INFO, what do you think they should have done?", "NTA. The wounds run deep and they are still bleeding. Your parents obviously didn't or couldn't protect you from your sister. They should have apologized at this meeting but instead got defensive and blew up into a rage. \n\nI expect that either your parents suffer a great deal of guilt for what they know occurred or are blowing off the damage you suffered, trying to pretend that you didn't suffer as much as you did. You probably know which one they are doing.\n\nPerhaps your approach could have been different, less accusatory, but I am sure your emotions run close to the surface even after so many years. Watching a program that brings it all back makes you relive it in the moment. \n\nI suggest getting therapy to help with coping with your PTSD. Time really doesn't make the memories fade. The professional might give some coping skills so your memories don't spoil your remaining years.", "Your parents clearly fucked up with your childhood, but that was partially due to a difficult position they were put in outside of their control. And for you, the timing is terrible here.\n\nThis also won\u2019t give you closure; you said that previous mentions also have yielded no positive results. These types of people never want to admit what they did is wrong, so by bringing this up it\u2019s something that damages both parties with no gain. If you think your parents are so awful that you don\u2019t care about that outcome and want to mar what is potentially your last time time with them then that\u2019s fine, but then I can\u2019t understand why you had them to stay in the first place if you think so poorly of them.\n\nSo I think this is ESH, then more than you because you\u2019ve clearly been hurt\u2014I just can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to accomplish here other than to hurt 3 people (yourself included) in different ways.", "Soft yta. It was poor timing to just bring this up out of the blue. Also my sister has borderline personality disorder there is only so much we could do, her crap literally affects all of us sometimes and the only way to deal with it is to cut back on contact. Which when you were kids would have been impossible for the parents. However they should've have been more supportive once you all were older. \nFor example if my sister has an episode I just don't talk to her for a few days or so until she's back into a proper state of mind.", "NTA. But, definitely bad-timing and out-of-leftfield. Your feelings about your experience are valid, but best expressed through psychotherapy first, before involving your parents. You'll never know if they did their best, or if they wilfully neglected you, so get comfortable with that. It might be worth an apology, to smooth things over for now. Please see a therapist though, that's a fair share of childhood trauma to still be carrying.", "NTA for telling them that you suffered but...\n\nYTA for doing it at that specific moment, out of the blue (triggered by a tv-show and not by a comment during conversation). There must have been dozens of moments in the past to have done this, but the timing was really hurtful.", "NTA\u2026maybe not the best way to communicate what you felt but NTA and I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you", "Info: what were you trying to achieve with this? Did you think he'd feel better after you told him? Do you feel better now? \n\nI had a mentally ill child. It was horrible for all of us. We did the best we could.

What do you think your father should have done?", "NTA\n\nThey failed to protect their child from an abusive sibling. Mine are the same, but as far as I'm aware there's no diagnosis to explain my brother's behaviour, he's just always been like that and I'm expected to \"suck it up, he's your brother!\" I'm told to get over myself, that it was the past, stop creating drama.\n\nSorry, but as a parent, I see how you failed to protect your child.", "NTA, maybe not the best timing, but if they refuse to see how they failed you, maybe it's time to cut them out?", "NTA, but in my experience, parents are never open to that conversation. You have every right to voice your frustration. I am sorry that happened to you.", "Ugh, I have to say a soft NTA. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located or your parents are from, but I grew up in a culture where mental health issues weren\u2019t publicly spoken about. \n\nWith that said, my mom has bipolar disorder and growing up as an only child was\u2026 extremely difficult. She was successful, brilliant, but in her manic phases, completely off the rails. She would threaten to take both hers and my life. Suffice to say it left a lot of scars and for a very long time, we had a terrible relationship. \n\nAs I became an adult, with my own career and mental health journey, I unpacked a lot of the damage left from my childhood and teenage years. And my mom became properly medicated and also sought the route of therapy. We now have an actually very good relationship. There are occasional bad days, but we both choose to walk away from the conflict and we are almost always able to resolve the issue a few days later when emotions aren\u2019t as high.\n\nA big part of that was both of us consciously moving on from the past. I\u2019ve told her that it\u2019s not that I forgive her, because I don\u2019t know that I can ever find that peace. But I want her in my life, and in order to make that happen, I have to accept that I cannot understand her struggles at that time. Do I really think she had malicious intent? No, but to a child, it didn\u2019t matter, the scars are there. And if I continue to have an accusatory tone and resentment towards her for a time that was extremely difficult for all of us, we would never be able to move forward. \n\nI suspect that while your parents weren\u2019t the ones with the mental health issues, they feel similarly to my mom. I know she struggles with extreme guilt for not being able to protect me from her manic phases, and I know seeing my own mental and emotional scars from her actions hurts her so much. Constantly bringing up their failures in what was likely a very shit situation for your entire family doesn\u2019t help anyone move forward, it just continually anchors you all in a place of pain. \n\nYou\u2019re 38, yes, it sucks that you have childhood trauma from dealing with an immediate family member with major mental health struggles, but if you continue to anchor in that trauma, you are going to be the AH. As an adult you have the choice to seek therapy to work through that trauma so you can move forward. If you choose not to, then that\u2019s on you. And likely, not moving forward will only continue to bleed resentment into all aspects of your life.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an AH, but come on. Knowing that this is likely their last visit with you, why would you bring this up?", "NTA. They failed you as parents, turned a blind eye to your abuse and clearly have no remorse for any of it. And fuck all the people saying it was \"bad timing\" or to just \"let it go\". It's always a \"bad time\" to call out your abusers because they never want to face the consequences of their actions. Fuck being gentle and diplomatic with them, you deserve to be heard. \n\nIt might be time to let them go. They don't care about the impact they've had on your life. They don't deserve your energy or consideration.

The timing for this discussion could have been better.", "> Like it was their choice?\n\n[There is a strong correlation between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD.[83][84][85] Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated.[86] Patients with BPD have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either sex. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently.[88] Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver or abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#Developmental_factors)\n\n>My dad immediately started yelling at me to stop blaming me for this\n\nNo further questions your honor.", "What timing would be good though? They don't want to hear about the abuse you suffered growing up, they have probably never wanted to hear about it, and you can either bring it up now or leave everything unsaid as they sweep it all under the carpet.\n\nIf they cannot even discuss this, do you want a relationship with them?", "Why do you keep in contact with them? They are more harm to you (and your child) then good.", "I understand this feeling. Then it just vomits out at the worst times for me.", "THANK YOU! I'm so sick of people making excuses for parents who don't protect their kids from their other kids.", "You really have no idea what your talking about.  I have been both the person being abused and have had children in this same situation.  There are many many situations where no matter what happens, you can't stop it.\n\nDo you just believe the 1 or the other every time?  Who do you trust?  How do you know 1 of them isn't making it up? What if they are hiding it from you?  Maybe the oldest is really good at hiding it and you and nobody around you ever sees it but the younger one keeps telling you they are being bullied?  Do you punish the older one with no Proof?   When you ask, what if they say it didn't happen?  Now you have to decide which one is lying.  What if they are both lying? What if the younger one thinks it's bullying but it's not really.  What if they never tell you?\n\nWhat happens when it's while your at work and you can't afford a \"proper\" babysitter? Do you get the older one to stop babysitting?  If so how do you afford it when you couldn't to begin with?  What do you do with the abuser then?  What if the new \" you can't afford\" baby sitter can't stop them from doing it either?\n\nHow do you know it's not just siblings being siblings and one of them is just taking it too personal?  What if OP is just remembering things incorrectly after all these years? Exaggerating it?  My daughter swears up and down that she raised her siblings for like 10 years.  She didn't even start watching them until she was 12 and only for 2 years and only for an hour a day.  But to her, that was \"raising\" them. I went to work at 5 and the ex got home at 6 maybe 6:30 if traffic was bad and I know they weren't lying cause I could see when she got there on the security cameras.\n\nWhat happens when you do know it's true, and you do everything you can to prevent it but the one that is bullying just won't stop?  Is there a point where you just give up and give them up for adoption? Juvi?  If it gets to that point, then your younger one has already been abused, a lot and you've tried and tried to stop it.\n\n\"it was their choice to LET one child abuse the other\"  Whatever...", "Sister was definitely the AH for hurting her.

OP had 20 years to bring it up, but he waited?", "Given their ages op will be going nc soon anyways", "When your children someday come to you to discuss this, I hope you're less defensive and more apologetic.  It'll save at least six months from the years of therapy they'll each need, not having to unpack why you don't take responsibility for allowing them to be hurt on top of everything else.\n\nI remember an Oprah special in which the parents kept separate households for the violent child and the targeted child, so the latter wasn't terrorized his entire childhood.  They then split time, alternating, with their children.  It's the only viable solution.  Just assuming one is lying so don't worry about it?  No.", "You are so defensive because you know you didn\u2019t do great with your kids. Sorry but it\u2019s not normal to leave a 12 year old on her own at home, but more, to look after your other kids??? If you can\u2019t afford babysitter, don\u2019t have kids. You can\u2019t expect your kids to look after each other. This is not normal. Apologise to your daughter and stop with your excuses. \nIf your kids don\u2019t get along, go to therapy together. There are ways to do that.\n\nIn the end, we are all humans and make mistakes. But what makes good parents is the ability to listen  and apologise. Tell them that you overestimated your capabilities of taking care of them, and you are sorry. And you love them. That\u2019s all they probably need now", "You can avoid leaving the bully and victim alone: they can go to a friend's house, or the bullied child can have a friend come over which should provide some protection. After school activities also provide some moments of safety. You won't be able to stop all the bullying, but a parent can really mitigate it. Even if you give up persuading your bully child to be good person, there are still things you can do.", "I think that depends. Maybe her sister didn\u2019t know what she was doing was wrong, or in her mind she was playing or engaging with her sister? I don\u2019t know. Our minds are completely different and it\u2019s impossible to know with the given info. \nBut yes I agree mental illness is not an excuse but you can\u2019t blame someone for the wrong if they can\u2019t comprehend their own actions.\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion!", "The mother is only 71 - chances are she's got at least another 15 years to go.", "She had bpd, they\u2019re usually aware that being violent is not ok.

Or they can't accept that their family wasn't perfect. Or that your sister was not a perfect child. \n\nYour feelings are absolutely valid. They may not accept them, and you can only choose how to move on from here. You may left everything behind and love the parents you have today, or you may choose to put specific boundaries to avoid any further suffering, like low contact or no contact. You can just refuse to talk about your childhood and your sister and just be with your parents. Whatever you choose, it's up to you.", "Personally, I\u2019d say NTA.

True, the life expectancy for women in the US is just under 80 years (dropped slightly during Covid) but that's at birth. (I looked the figures up on the CDC website). That life expectancy includes the possibility of dying way earlier, e.g. an accident during childhood, death during childbirth, an overdose, cancer at 45 years old...you get the picture. It's an average. \n\nHowever when you've made it to a certain age the life expectancy for that age group is no longer the original average expectancy, but higher.

They were 2 clueless people with little to no help and their hands full.

But it might make you feel better to talk to someone about this, not to forgive them, but to let that anger go.", "**NTA**\n\nFirstly, I am sorry this happened to you. I am so sorry you had to go through what you did. I cannot imagine it was easy for any of you with a sibling/daughter with those diagnoses. None the less, they had a duty of care towards you. Their job was to protect you, to nurture you, to make you feel safe, secure, loved. They clearly, good intetions or otherwise, failed in this duty. You've said there being sexual abuse as well but not said by whom. I've read through your comments and it seems you've done a lot of work on understanding what happened. But, validly so, the child in you wants an apology. Wants them to understand the hurt.\n\nThe way you describe the incident and based on your comments it seems that you did not make it clear what you wanted from the interaction. You've explicitly said in the comments that you wanted an apology or aknowledgement of how tough it was on you. How unfair it was. You did not get that. Instead, you told your parents your childhood was ruined, and they took that as a personal attack. It sounds like the communication broke down swiftly as they reverted and you reverted to previous versions of yourselves. \n\nNow for the important bit. Your parents are nearing the last phase of their life. You may be choice or by ill fortune never see them again. They flew half way around the world to see you and your kids. Are they the same people they were back then? Irrespective of not having had the therapy to gain insight and having done the required introspection are they the same? If yes, you're 38 years old, cut them out. If not ask yourself, was this really the moment to bring this up? Was it the moment to, after not seeing them for years to push this issue. It is entirely valid if the answer is yes and you needed to leave nothing unsaid. That is an entirely reasonable need, want, ask that, if they cannot handle, it is best you part ways. If you feel your kids knowing them, you knowing them again, spending some time with them as an adult is more important then maybe try and diffuse. You are NTA here and there are no wrong or right answers. Once things cool down however, if you have no closure, I would suggest thinking if there was a different approach to communicate what you were hoping to receive from them. \n\nGood luck OP this one broke my heart. It sounds like you made a wonderful life for yourself though. Well done.", "NTA and your feelings are valid. Your timing sucked and you might want to show some empathy to your parents. 30 years ago, mental health and associated illnesses were not spoken about. There wasn't the help out there that there is now. Your sister most likely terrorised the whole household, not just you, and as parents, I imagine they were torn apart, wanting to help her and protect you.", "NTA\n\nBut I would suggest a therapist to help you unpack your childhood and help develop some strategies to move forwards if there are triggering events.\n\nYour father was in the wrong with how he reacted to your words.  He should've apologised and validated your feelings but he didn't.  Not sure if that's guilt or the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in your older sister but he's better at masking... but less good now that he's getting older.\n\nThe difficult thing for your parent is that you are all their children.  And there are expectations when the kids are under age  that you actually care for them.  It's not as easy as saying just get rid of the problem child.  In fact in CPS cases where an older child is quite abusive to the rest of the family (say 14/15 as an age), that CPS would rather take the younger children as it's easier to get foster homes for them rather than the usually older, problem child.  \n\nBut the difficulty is that you feel like you are sacrificing a child or two for the problem child.  Sometimes you do your best to set up boundaries and you don't tolerate a lot... but it's hard to shield other kids when someone is having a meltdown and even if they are nowhere near them it's still a trigger because they do have PTSD, even if it's just from the yelling... much less anything else that goes on.\n\nI hope that all the kids got some sort of counselling but I suspect not.", "NTA, but you have no tact. And it seems like you're not going to get what you want from them. I would instead recommend therapy. Where you can have your feelings validated and where you can work through this.", "NTA! While my initial thought was that the timing may have been abrupt, there's no right time to have that conversation and it sounds like you've already tried several times before. It isn't easy for anyone to acknowledge that their actions or lack of action has hurt someone close to them, but if they care about the relationship with you they need to push through their discomfort to recognize your pain and apologize for their part in it.\n\nI grew up kinda similarly with an abusive older sister (4 years older) who was originally diagnosed as Bipolar and later Borderline. I always thought that it was just normal to be bullied by your siblings and that I just got it worse than my friends. I didn't even know sibling abuse was a thing until I started therapy last year, started diving into some of my issues, and came across a Psychology Today article called \"Sibling Bullying and Abuse: The Hidden Epidemic\". \n\nI've had a few conversations with my parents since then about how I feel like they didn't protect me enough from her and how unfair it was to put me in a sort of monitor situation to keep track of my older sister as she went wild in highschool. I could tell the conversation made them uncomfortable, and they had excuses but those led to us discussing their thought processes at the time and how they were wrong. It hurt them to hear how they messed up and caused me pain, but they apologized and that's what you should expect from the people in your life who claim to love you. \n\nIt's entirely up to you if you want to keep trying to broach the subject with them, but if they don't start to acknowledge their part I would consider going LC with them just for your own mental well-being.", "NTA. That's your dad's guilt speaking there. Talk about victim blaming. I've had a similar exchange with my mom when I (36F) told her that my dad's alcoholism ruined my childhood and the family life we could have had. My mom snapped at me that I always \"got what I wanted\" and what else could I need?? And I said that I'd be an idiot to refuse my dad's 'providing' for his family as a minor, but that doesn't mean I condoned the abuse! Sure, we had a roof over our heads, clothes, got a university education... But home life was S*IT. Really, really sh*t! My mom always stayed with my dad because she felt guilty leaving him, even though she also received her share of emotional abuse...  But she lashed out at me (victim) because the only one with any power to protect us or remove us from that situation was my mom, and she chose to stay and defend my dad. Hearing now that we kids were in pain is something she struggles to take in.\n\n(Flash forward, they are on the brink of divorce now.)\n\nAnyways - it's guilt. You were a minor, and your parents clearly don't like hearing about your sister's mental illness your perspective. \n\nI'm sorry OP,  but sometimes we actually sadly just can't talk to our parents about the abuse we suffered as kids - not that we shouldn't try... But they want to bury things in the past where we want to talk about them honestly and openly to be able to move on.\n\nYou are NTA at all... But I don't really think anyone is the AH here. It's just a sad situation and I hope you are able to have an open, honest and non-hostile conversation with your parents about your lived reality one day.", "NTA, we can be traumatized by a lot as children and as someone who had an abusing Bipolar brother I understand. How your parents SHOULD have reacted was, \"I'm sorry\". Even though it's not always their fault the parent shouldn't start screaming at you because you have trauma. I would recommend low to no contact with them, it sounds like they're just going to gaslight you into believing you're wrong.

It's rare that parents will acknowledge negligence or abuse, but when they do, it can really help people heal. \n\nHere, I don't think that the OP has any hope of getting her parents to admit that they should have done more to protect her, but I understand her drive to get them to even aknowledge her pain. \n\nYou never exactly 'recover' from child abuse as it happens in the years when you form your character, but as you get older and have more of your life without abuse, it becomes easier to deal with and you can build a personality for yourself that is more than just a response to abuse. At 38, the OP will probably have lived about half her life without abuse, so she should be doing quite well I hope, but the bitterness is still there, and that's understandable.", "Now op that was my own experience, getting that apology may actually help you specifically heal, but with the way your parents are acting you\u2019re either never gonna get it, or it\u2019s gonna be a good couple years until you do.", "Thanks for the book recommendation!", "I was reacting more to the possible jump to \u201cdad sexually abused the older sister.\u201d This is Reddit, after all.", "FFS, that's horrific. I'm so sorry! Your mother is a sorry excuse for a human being. You deserved a real mother and got  monster.", "This was very hard to read but you\u2019re right.", "I think it's a question of the seriousness of the abuse. All parents probably miss some bullying, but there are limits to what a good parent will miss. For example, I had a friend with mental health issues who tried to smother her brother with a pillow from time to time. I was horrified when she told me this, but neither she nor her parents seemed to take it seriously, and her brother wasn't allowed a lock on his door and developed sleep issues (she usually attacked him at night). I think you are thinking of ordinary bullying, and not the extreme, no holds barred abuse that mentally ill children may inflict on their siblings. (By the way, my friend was well aware that what she was doing was wrong.)", "That's true, it's one that's jumped on fairly quickly usually. It is a larger block of text so easy to miss that either way, I thought.", "I think you've gotten the answer to your question, you just don't want to hear it because your situation is a little too close to the parents'.  \n\nIt sounds as though you've had a hard time.  If you were aware of the challenges that the situation you were in, you're probably handled it better than OP's parents were able to.  I hope you're able to find a resolution with your own children if that's what you need.  Maybe speaking to them openly, without becoming defensive, would help you as well as them.", "I am a bit older than you but similar ages and my mum ages with your parents too. They have a generational view of \u2018I gave up everything for you so you should be grateful\u2019. And I have a lot to be grateful for but then I also know that my parents very much did what they wanted a lot of the time too. You don\u2019t ask to be born and when people make that choice they should realise it comes with sacrifices. My parents made some but chose not to make lots and I became very mature for my age very young. \nYou have to realise that you should have a basic expectation of your parents taking care of you as a child. You do not in fact owe them gratitude because they put food on the table and protected you from harm. Those are the absolute basics and you can absolutely hold them responsible for not even providing. Your feelings are valid but you may never have them affirmed by your parents I am afraid. You need to focus on finding a way to process all that yourself. It is hard but it will make you stronger when you really do find that peace all on your own. Easiest way to do it is focus on yourself and the things that bring you joy. Things fall into place naturally when you learn to do that. Good luck!", "I don't think I got an answer to my question. I'm really trying to understand because this is so close to home. \n\nThe OP said something that clearly really hurt their dad. Was that their intention? Did they think it wouldn't hurt their dad?\n\nI would like to understand. I would like the OP to explain to me what it was they wanted. Did they feel like all this time that their parents didn't know that this impacted them? If so, did this interaction help? Or could the interaction have happened differently?\n\nI'm not attacking the OP. I want to understand where they're coming from", "I mean after he died we all were really sad. \n\nWe talked about it all the time. We were all impacted.", "No its not harrasment its telling the truth.A truth they cant handle. Dont like it your free to leave but she is entitled to telling her truth how ever many times she wants to", "She can go NC when she feels like its worth it but she also deserves acknowledgment for what happened to her", "OP says in other comments that yes, their parents do refuse to acknowledge how their sibling\u2019s situation affected them, and that mainly what they want is affirmation that yes, it sucked and was unfair.\n\nWhat they wanted out of the interaction was for their dad to say, \u201cYes, we know your sibling\u2019s issues made your childhood harder and we\u2019re sorry we  weren\u2019t able to prevent that.\u201d", "It really comes across as you hijacking the OP's pain and situation to make it all about you, unfortunately, even if that is not your intent.

Their dad was negligent/enabling to the abuse that happened throughout OP's childhood. Maybe if hearing the truth is hurtful that's just how it is. It sounds like you are really projecting yourself into this situation as the parents and trying to defend them because you, yourself, had a hard time, and that's not appropriate because a) this isn't about you right now, and b) defensive reactions don't help situations like this (see, for instance, OP's dad's denial).", "Okay, you\u2019re clearly too dense to understand or you\u2019re projecting. You also can\u2019t spell, so I\u2019m done arguing with you.", "You clearly dont understand what its like to grow up in a situation like that. Yall will freely judge her and how she decides to go about her situation without truly understanding her pain. Maybe instead of calling other people dense why dont you not  give advice on stuff you don't understand or have never been through. Im also done too cause you obviously are too narrow minded to truly understand.", "NTA but serious question: why would you want your children around people who failed to protect you as a child?", "NTA.", "Jesus. At some point we have to get over the ways in which our parents failed us if they really did their best.", "ESH\n \nYour parents should have know or noticed. And it\u2019s something they should hear. But was that moment really the best time to drop that on them, as if they can magically fix it?\n \nAlso you are valid to say those claims and discuss how it hurt you. But bringing them up 21 years after the fact isn\u2019t a healthy way to discuss them. And putting that on your parents, who are trying to visit their grandchild, just seems like you are trying to get vindication for something long sense past.", "NTA.\n\nI's good that you told them, because it helps exorcise the bad feelings that haunt you because of their refusal to protect you.\n\nLetting them know how you feel cleanses the bad feeling to an extent. But if you don't tell them, you will continue to be overwhelmed by those feelings.\n\nOf course your father rejected what you said. All parents refuse to take the blame for what they did. It's in their contract.", "NTA. \n\nThat is not a rational response so you probably hit a nerve. Your experience and feelings are valid. His reaction really isn't. \n\nIf they want to go back because of this, let them. I don't see how you can \"make this nice\" without completely invalidating yourself.", "NAH.  Your sister being mentally ill effected your childhood.  Im guessing your parents did their best at the time.  Its got to hurt to learn that even doing your best to protect you, that it affected you so much.  Seems like everyone is hurt.", "NTA, help them pack.", "Maybe not so much of bad timing but how she went about broaching the subject.  It was an excellent opportunity to bring it up, given the TV show. But to just turn around in the middle of it during and blurt it out was bound to catch them off guard.  A \u201chey, I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about something and this has reminded me\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m sure they heard \u201cit was your fault you didn\u2019t know how to deal/cope with a child that had these issues and that my childhood was ruined\u201d.  Maybe that is even 100% true, though I\u2019m going to guess this never would have been anything they chose.  Also, depending on when you grew up, there may not have been nearly as many resources and support available to them.  If your Dad reacted so quickly, it\u2019s probably bubbling under the surface as guilt for him.  \n\nMaybe this visit was their way to try and connect with you and heal, especially as you have admittedly said it will probably be your last with them.  Now they are worried this might be all that you want to talk about. \n\nA lot of assumptions on my part- at the end of the day, you absolutely have the right to talk with them about how you were affected by your sister\u2019s behavior and mental issues.  If you can, maybe try to approach them and ask to share their perspective of the situation, as you would like to share yours, so that you all may be able to understand, heal some, and move forward.", "Thanks for sharing this!", "We understand that, OP.

OPs parent would never have heard of them, not have the tools to deal with them and they probably did do their best. Today we have far more resources to help but back then, they wouldn't have even had Internet to look things up. \nIt's easy to judge by today's standards but try being those parents at that time in history. It has likely left them with a great amount of trauma too. I get that OP did suffer but it helps nobody, inclueding op, to randomly bring it up. They were not the abusers and I'm sure they did do their best. If op needs resolution then he needs to see a therapist and potentially confront his sister but frankly even that is not a great idea depending on her current mental state.", "Yes AND it\u2019s often effective to set a time to check in.

Seems unlikely that it would be THAT different than the original book though.", "You said exactly what I said but with different words lmao", "Thank you.\n\nThat's not even the tip of the iceberg!  Shes a covert narcissist with a masters in weaponized incompetence. \n\nShe's NEVER taken responsibility for ANYTHING in her life.  She's only ever cared about how things look on the outside.  \n\nDoesn't matter if the inside is a festering pool of garbage and roadkill.

Obviously the OP does or they wouldn't have posted the question. And given my situation, I actually have some insight into whether they were or weren't. It's not as if people never share their related experiences on this board. It's pretty much what makes up most threads.  How many times have people shared their own bridesmaid horror stories in response to a posting. \n\nAnd the OP still hasn't answered  me about what their intent was . So I gave some potential intents to try and understand. I could be wrong. I'm just trying to find out. \n\nI still am withholding judgment because I don't understand what the OP wanted to achieve with their comment. And, just as importantly, did they succeed with whatever they wanted. \n\nI'm not sure why the OP isn't answering that question.", "Okay OP. If this is what you wanted, do you feel you got what you were hoping for? And looking back, do you think that there was a chance you would get that based on how you went around this?", "OP has repeatedly answered the question. They wanted acknowledgement from their parents that they, the parents, knew that OP's life was dramatically and negatively influenced by the sister's illness and the way the parents treated both children. OP has said this repeatedly and clearly. If you don't think OP has answered the question, that says a lot more about you in this case.", "ESH\n\nWhy did you bother telling your parents your childhood was ruined because.... blah, blah?\n\nVindictiveness? Wanting to see if they would back you up -- 20 years too late?\n\nIf your parents were making plans to go back early, then the situation didn't die out.", "I'm going to tell you about a situation I had with my mother. It will be long, so sorry about that. Also, not that it really needs said but you're NTA.\n\nLast year I had an email conversation with my mother, we are LC email only and she was not the person who raised me, that was her mother. I am on friendly enough terms with my parents, they are actually nice people in many ways but they were not present in my life much at all during my childhood and then when I had to move in with them as a teenager because my granny passed they were fucking crazy strict about random shit and had no clue how to parent a teenage girl. I bounced at age 15 because I couldn't stand it, got married young and had a few kids and now am seriously ill and no longer working. (Relevant)\n\nAnyway this email conversation was me trying to clear the air a bit, my childhood was kinda fucked up because my twin had cancer (and died) and my elder siblings from my dad's first marriage were removed from their mother and step father for serious abuse. Obviously my siblings were pretty traumatized already and were then taken to live in a house with a sick kid with an old woman they didn't know who they weren't even related to and for a couple years I became the family punch bag. \n\nMy mother told me she was sad that we didn't have a better relationship because she always has to hear about her siblings kids and how well they're doing for themselves, she had cancer and I'm her only living child so I guess she was feeling some kinda way.  I responded with something along the lines of it makes me sad too and that I had always felt like she was disappointed in me as a child because she always praised my (much older) cousins and talked about how they all had fancy degrees and professional jobs (I'm actually a qualified social worker with 2 fucking degrees btw, so this is a joke frankly, but obviously I was a kid at the time) and lots of money etc. I didn't bring up the abuse by my siblings or the fact that she literally abandoned me with her mother for nearly 14 years or the weird gaslighting I got from my entire family after my twin died (they pretty much erased him and never spoke about it again like it didn't happen and then made me feel crazy if I ever brought it up, I think my mum had a mental breakdown after and everyone was pandery but I was only a little kid and didn't live with her so I can't be sure as nobody will talk to me about it) \n\nHer response? \"Yeah you were always a bit of a disappointment.\" \n\nOof.\n\nMy point is that it rarely goes how you want it to with these people. If they haven't already acknowledged your pain in 38 years they probably never will. Either move on and have a surface level relationship with them (this is what I chose) or just cut them off entirely. I'm sorry, it's shit and wrong and they should absolutely acknowledge the reality of the situation.", "Total asshole. Either drop the past and let your parents enjoy the grandkids or save everyone the drama and don't invite them.", "At first, I wondered if he had tried to address concerns but had been shot down. As you continued describing his response, I then thought that there may be a history of mental illness on his side of the family that you are not aware of.\n\nIt could also be that they just want to fiercely deny that they let you be hurt by your sister.\n\nI'm sorry for what you've experienced and for the current situation you are dealing with. The most important thing is keeping you and your family - esp. the children - in a healthy environment now.", "NTa but I agree with the bad timing comments. Maybe you need to get therapy for yourself and perhaps offer to include them in the session to help heal yourself in regards to your trauma", "You waited a little too long for this.

DO YOU WANT THEM TO BE GASLIGHTED TOO ?", "Why do you keep approaching them then ? Can't you understand that they don't care about hurting you ? Why are you so hung up on that ?", "To be clear, I do know, which is also how I know how little it actually helps to make these kinds of comments hoping for anything different from them. It\u2019s absolutely understandable that OP would still feel anger, but if it\u2019s so much and so intense that it spills out at random times (like when watching TV) then maybe it should have been considered whether the parents should come to stay at all\u2014for the benefit of all parties.", "Not really on topic but even if you HAD been there, let's say you were between 1 month old and 4yo... you wouldn't have any memories from it anyway? \n\n\n\nLike, sometimes people ask me if I've ever done X thing or went to X place and I'm like \"Not really, I mean I did when I was 5yo but it doesn't really count, I have no memories of how it was\"", "What you're doing here is putting a time limit on victims of trauma getting to talk about their trauma.

I can only assume that it's her own insecurities that make her that way and that makes me pity her more than anything.
