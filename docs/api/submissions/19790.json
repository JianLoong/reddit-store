Ashley and I have been self-sufficient for our adult lives. \n\nJohn and I were going to Amsterdam, while Ashley was going to Spain. \nThe Amsterdam flight was an hour before Spain, and we got there 3 hours early.\nJohn and I lined up in our check in queue which took about an hour to get checked in. While we were waiting we ended up talking about how John had never done so much waiting at an airport in his life. Normally he would show up at the bare minimum time. Sometimes he would miss his flights, but his dad would just book another one.\nI mentioned that as we have always had to organise and pay for our own flights,  Ashley and I had never missed one and always went there early.\n\nEventually we got checked in. As we were early and Ashley's flight was still later, I decided to go wait with her in her check in line.\nJohn said he would go outside and call some family.\nAs time passed I saw the line was building to go through security, so I called John to advise him to go through to the gate. He said he wanted to get some food, and not to worry he would go through after.  A little while later I left Ashley to go through Security myself. I texted John and told him I was heading through. As I was going through the security line I realised it was longer than I thought. I texted John again to say he should go through security as it is quite busy. He replied saying okay no worries.\nI saw John in the security line quite far back. I told him that once we get through we need to run to the gate as the time was getting a bit tight. Again he replied not to worry about it.\nI finally got through security and ran straight to the gate. As I got there they announced the final call for passengers. I sent another text to John to say the final call had gone out and to get there ASAP, then I got on the plane.\nAs I got to my seat I got a call from John confirming he had missed the flight and had to look for another.\nIt turned out that the next flight to Amsterdam required John to fly to Germany, then wait 10 hours overnight, before flying to Amsterdam the next day.\n\nWhen we met up in Amsterdam the next day he was annoyed at me and claimed he didn't know when the flight was as he didn't look at his ticket to check it. When I reminded him how many times I told him to go through customs, he said he didn't think the plane would leave without him.\n\nAITA here? I can admit that I could have stayed and missed the flight as well, but I didn't want to suffer the consequences of his actions. We had nothing booked in Amsterdam so there were no real consequences of missing the flight other than inconvenience, but I figured it could be a learning experience for him.", "created_utc": 1686886965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14am47w/aita_for_letting_a_friend_miss_a_flight/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Simple.", "NTA - John is an adult, & needs to learn that life doesn't revolve around him. He needs to learn to be more organized & to take responsibility for his actions.", "NTA. He thought the plane wouldn\u2019t leave without him!!?  \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. It's not your fault that a grown man can't LOOK at his own ticket.", "NTA.  though you too are pretty clueless.  You wasted so much time and then went thru security.  Surely you all know they sell food and drink after the security check point?  You all sound clueless.", "NTA any adult who thinks a plane will wait for them, unless they're a pilot or otherwise part of the flight crew, is going to get a swift reality check. It's not your responsibility to herd John through the airport like a lost duckling.", "NTA. Lack of action has consequences. He \"didn't think the plane would leave without him\"?! LOL - this guy is set up for a hard landing into adulthood. \n\nShort of holding his hand and dragging him along (which might have triggered airport security concerns), you couldn't have done more.", "NTA, he is a grown adult and he should have known to checked. It is not like you didn't warn him about potentially being late", "NTA and you should probably realize this too will not be a learning tool for him.", "NTA.  You are both grown people.", "NTA and this is a valuable lesson for John that the world, let alone an airplane, does not revolve around him. How did he think the plane wouldn\u2019t leave without him when he himself admits he\u2019s had to buy new flights for missing them before??????", "NTA at all. You tried to help him and he actively choose to ignore your advice. You shouldn\u2019t have to incur extra costs too, to accompany him. Your friend sounds very immature. He needed the lesson that a whole plane full of waiting people and air control aren\u2019t going to wait for Mr. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d.", "NTA Call this his first step into self responsibility and adulthood.", "NTA. It was most certainly a needed learning experience for him.", "NTA, your up to date time \"hey bud...\" messages were more than enough. You did more than your due diligence, he just didn't", "NTA. You did your best to guide him and ensure he made it to the gate on time. So, in that regard, I don't think you're necessarily the one to blame for him missing the flight.", "NTA, he's an adult and you're not his keeper. You did more than your due diligence trying to get him on the plane and unless you two are dating I don't see why he'd expect you to hold back and miss the flight as well.", "Lol NTA my guy. John is a grown ass adult.

NTA", "NTA but I'm not getting his reasoning or yours...you finish a conversation about how he misses flights all the time. Then you watch him wander off to do useless stuff, seemingly without connected this could complicate things or he's not a person to trust on time management at this moment. Then he misses the flight, which he just said he's done lots of times before, and his excuse is he didn't think the plane would leave, even though he literally just said that lots of planes have left him before....", "\"Stewardess, can you ask the pilot to wait for my friend?\" Lol...", "NTA.

I love the happy meal reference. This just screams of someone who has never had to take responsibility for their actions. He mentioned John still lives at home and his dad pays for everything. He has no appreciation for money or others time apparently. It\u2019s sad. But he is being coddled and it shows. Blaming OP because he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to look at his ticket or listen is just wow. This isn\u2019t at 12yo. It\u2019s a 30yo grown ass adult. Imagine what happens when dad is gone and he needs to work and deal with real life problems. It\u2019s going to crush him.", "And instead of looking into alternate transport, he flew to Germany and waited 10 hours?? I\u2019ve taken trains from Germany to Amsterdam in under 3. \n\nI question a lot about this kid.", "Yeah, I was about to die laughing at that. John is totally clueless to think that would actually happen.\n\nJohn's dad is failing in his duties as a father in covering the cost of his son's screw-ups. Sooner or later, dad won't be around to cover his ass anymore. Then, where will John be?\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: to add NTA", "\"Let the captain know that John isn't here yet so we cannot depart\" lmao how arrogant can he possibly be??", "I literally laughed aloud at that line.", "Sometimes they won\u2019t. If you\u2019re already checked in they\u2019ll wait a bit for you. Not saying OP is an asshole but if they would have let the gate attendant or a flight attendant know their friend was coming but was getting through security, they probably would have delayed for 10-15 min.", "Actually it wouldn't if he checked in baggage. Did they fly to Europe without?", "he has a grown up body, but the mind of a child ....", "That's what I was thinking. Are airports in other countries arranged differently? I always go through security then find a place to eat.", "Depends on the airport. At Amsterdam Schiphol (which I appreciate is their arrival airport, not departure) they have a bunch of mini securities at each gate, and pretty much nothing after.", "Probably won't learn if he's the main character", "He gets to be upset, but he was annoyed with OP who continuously tried to help him. He is in the wrong for not owning up to his mistake.", "It's fine to be upset. It's not fine to blame your friend for your own actions. That's why this is an NTA situation. One of them is an asshole and it is not OP.", "He'll be at the airport... A LOT.", "Maybe in Europe. In the US a plane will not hold like that for one person. They may hold for a group, rushing from a delayed flight, but even that is becoming rarer. Planes have a specific amount of time they are allowed at the gate here. If they go over, there are huge fines.", "I did not know this so thank you for that info. I try really hard to be on time for things. It\u2019s a pet peeve of mine so I wasn\u2019t aware. Good to know.", "and why should an entire plane of people wait for one irresponsible person? it's not like he was late because of things out of his control", "Not any more - a few years now they have centralised security.", "I think I missed the part where he blamed her.", "I\u2019ve seen them hold for one person. They didn\u2019t for very long, less than 10 minutes. They also paged him by name twice before they closed up. This was all precovid so I\u2019m not sure about now. And again, it\u2019s when you\u2019re already checked in for the flight so you\u2019re at the airport already.", "It\u2019s not always a irresponsible person. Sometimes things happen that put you behind through not fault of your own."]}
