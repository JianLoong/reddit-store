I (31) female have been with my current man (32) male for about 12 years now. I was 20 when I met him I already had my daughter and only dated for about six months before having our first son together. Although I wasn\u2019t ready for another child I accepted it and moved in with his parents as he was still residing with them. I soon realized what a mistake this was because his mother became very controlling about the way I was going to raise my son. She wanted to do things HER way and wouldn\u2019t let me do things my way. This cause several fights in the household. I\u2019ve asked my husband several times for us to move out to no avail. He keeps making excuses like \u201cwe have no money\u201d \u201cmy dad won\u2019t have a way to work\u201d etc. my dad has offered us help on numerous occasions even offering to co-sign on a house, just so we can have our own space. Of course my man refuses. It\u2019s been TWELVE years and we are still living with his parents, in less than ideal conditions. The house isn\u2019t bad but it\u2019s extremely cramped. Let me explain. The house has three bedrooms total. In the house are six adults, three children (our kids) and a dog. His mother and father have the biggest bedroom. Both his brothers have their own bedrooms. That being said my man and I and TWO of our kids ages (9)&(10) are sleeping in the bedroom with us. While my oldest daughter (13) sleeps on the couch. AM I THE ASSHOLE for demanding to move out of his parents house so that we and the kids have our OWN space????? Just an FYI I did have a great job that paid me 18 an hour, my two youngest children are autistic and they\u2019ve had their challenges in school therefore I had to quit my job because he made more money than me. I understand why and did so, I\u2019ve since been actively applying to any job I can to start working again. It\u2019s been 12 years how long does he expect me to wait??", "created_utc": 1704748541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191w9pw/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_move_out_of_his/", "score": 354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
