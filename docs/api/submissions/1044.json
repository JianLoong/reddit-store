I still wanted the soup so I got up and did it myself.

She knew I was sick and called to check up on me. She asked what I ate for dinner like she always does and I said Chicken Noodle Soup. She said that was great and that was nice of my husband. Now here is where I could be the asshole. I told my mom that I made it for myself, and my husband was right next to me and heard the conversation. She just said oh okay and skimmed over it but after the phone call my husband and I got into a big argument about it. He called me some choice words and told me not to ask him for anything anymore since soup was such a big deal to me. \nI told my mom did not care that much and even though I didn\u2019t have to say it, I DID make the soup for myself. He has still not dropped it and for the past couple days, whenever I would try to bring it up he would not talk to me.  He told me he was going to his moms house on Friday and not to bother him. I have been reminded that I am an asshole throughout this process but my mom said it\u2019s not a big deal and sometimes guys don\u2019t want to look bad and are like that.\n\nEdit: to be clear I don\u2019t think he is TA in this situation and I probably should have just said yes when my mom said my husband made it.", "created_utc": 1667492717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yl7749/aita_for_making_chicken_noodle_soup/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's upset because it made him look bad but HE is the one that made himself look bad and should get over it.", "NTA. He didn't do something that you asked more than once for So you did it yourself. I'm pretty sure most reasonable humans would do that. Honestly he sounds like my husband. And if I had asked a third time I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. If I don't ask the third time then I didn't remind him and I'm an AH.. But if I do ask him the third time then I'm pestering him. That's what you were in for. All you did was correct your mom when she assumed that your husband had made it. You're not a bad guy for stating facts. He's acting like a child and gaslighting you. Does he act like this often?

You deserve better. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou asked him to do something, He said he would do it, and then didn't follow through. When you made the soup yourself he said he was \"just about to do it,\" which strikes me as a defense mechanism against being criticized inferentially. \n\nHim, still feeling that he had been critiqued, interpreted you telling you mother that you cooked the soup as being equivalent to emphasizing that he did not, which is asinine. As far as I'm aware, you did not tell her that you asked him to do something that he didn't follow through on.\n\nIt sounds like he feels more bad about being perceived as having been inconsiderate, than actually being inconsiderate.

Throw the whole man away \ud83e\udd22", "So so so NTA!  You told your mom the truth and he explodes? It's because it makes him look bad.  It's one thing if you are intentionally throwing him under the bus, but it doesn't sound like that.  If he doesn't want to look bad he can change his behavior.  It's not your responsibility to cover for him.  His reaction is way overboard and reeks of emotional manipulation.  Hold your boundaries OP.", "Wow, your husband is mad that you did not lie that he made the soup to make him look good? And this was after he said he'd make it for you when you asked him to, but he did not end up making it even after you reminded him more than once? Does he always behave like this?", "NTA. Your husband is acting like an infant", "When you say \"make soup,\" are you meaning just \"open a can and heat it in the microwave\"? So like 2 minutes?\n\nNTA. But if that's the case, then I'm baffled by why you let him put you off twice (after his shower, after he relaxes, etc.).  I would have expected/demanded he go do it when I first asked. He doesn't have a leg to stand on getting mad because you told your Mom.", "NTA.

I move on and make it clear that I expect him to do so as well.     \n\nHe has learned that if it procrastinates long enough, I will do it myself and let him wallow in the guilt.

Sure, everyone forgets things sometimes. We're all human, but the good people usually don't have to be reminded more than once. And a reasonable response to \"Hey you said you'd do X\" is \"yes I forgot, I'll do that now\" or \"I'm sorry, I don't have time to do this anymore\". The men in my life do what they said they'd do (ETA-usually without any reminders), especially when they agreed to feed their sick SO. You deserve better.", "Nope.  He just wants you to *think* all guys do it so you don\u2019t start asking yourself why you\u2019re with one of the assholes who does when you don\u2019t have to be.", "Not all guys do that.\n\nHe's using it as an excuse to be lazy and selfish.", "This is some weaponized incompetence...especially if he's reacting that way when you ask/doing it yourself.", "Not all guys do it, and good ones know if they do do it to at least apologize. And not all guys gaslight their girlfriend for stating a fact. Think about how your dad treats your mom when he's forgotten to do something . I'm pretty sure it's not by gaslighting her and running to his moms. Now, My husband can be forgetful and there are times when I get up and do it myself just so I don't have to hear the \" I was about to do that\". He can even pout sometimes. But He's never left to go to his mommy's house because he's mad at me for stating a fact like he forgot to do something. And I've always gotten an apology, whether it's for something as little as just forgetting or because he's realized that he was being childish. Remember you did nothing wrong in this situation. Do not let him make you feel like you did. Which is something. It sounds like he's good at doing and has been doing for a while. Take a step back and take a look at your whole relationship from an outside perspective.", "Nope, most guys definitely don't gaslight and manipulate their partners. You are NTA but your husband is toxic af.", "[removed]", "Props to you for admitting it lol. At least these weren't the troll accounts bashing X specific thing.", "OP, you're too nice. Your husband didn't \"forget\". He just didn't feel like making the soup. \n\nYou're NTA, but your husband is an AH.", "Seriously? He wouldn't make you canned soup? He's 100% the asshole, is he always like this?", "When my friends or family are sick or hurt, that tends to claim a lot of real estate in the front of my mind. My friends and family seem to be the same way towards me. I can't imagine forgetting that my partner asked for a small favor when they felt like shit. I definitely need my downtime but I don't think I'd be able to fully relax knowing someone I care about is ill and had asked for my help but I hadn't lifted a finger yet.", "Your comment has been removed due to a [rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) violation.

And most of the time after forgetting he will do it"]}
