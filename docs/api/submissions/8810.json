He lives with me in my apartment and I pay all of our bills, own both of our cars. I work as a software engineer and make a good salary, he is currently unemployed but does Uber with one of my cars and has previously worked part time jobs. He pays for gas for the car but I do most of the maintenance and pay insurance. I also do most of the house work because while he is willing to help, he always cooks badly, loads the dishwasher badly etc and it becomes easier for me to just do it myself. It is an apartment so this is not a major issue for me and I can manage although I would sure appreciate if he contributed more but I love him otherwise.\n\nRecently we had a talk about our future, talked about kids etc. He mentioned wanting a kid soon and that for the child's security he wants to be added to the title of my apartment which I am still paying a mortgage for. He said he could contribute to the mortgage in proportion to his income.\n\nI got quite annoyed at this and I thought this was unfair and said unless he pays me back half of my down-payment, mortgage payments up to now and mortgage advance payments I would not do this. He has little savings as he spends on things like upgrading his PC every generation, and sometimes loses money on stocks.\n\nI told him this and brought up other things like me doing most of the housework, and that his current Uber gig was only possible since I paid for the car.\n\nHe called me an AH and said that it was unfair and that couples should contribute in proportion to their capacity and he cannot get high paying jobs as me as he is a college drop out and is that I was rude since I could have just said no instead of belittling him about his finances which he is already insecure about.\n\nI feel like he opened the can of worms and I have never previously complained about the financial imbalance and have been supportive and understanding about my higher earning potential and already help him out enough by having bought our cars and paying most bills.", "created_utc": 1675215160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qgu1f/aita_for_not_belittling_my_bf_about_his_finances/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What's he gonna do for retirement in 20-25 years? Are you planning to make enough for both of you? Even if he dropped out of college, that was like 20 years ago. What skills has he developed since?

It might get surprisingly nasty.\n\nMake a plan and stick to it. You may need to get help or advice. Even if you decide to wait, do the planning now.", "Maybe you should check your saviour complex. You are still making excuses for him when he should have been kicked out yesterday. Don't want to name call but you have a serious case of saviour complex.", "Is \"decent company\" really what you want in a partner?", "I know you're getting downvoted for this comment, so I won't. \n\nBut I will add my thoughts. \n\nLook at your language - he is 'decent' company, he is a travel companion (on trips you presumably pay for), and you 'enjoy' his conversation. Any of these could be fulfilled by people who don't expect to own half your house.\n\nYou also don't like that he is living rent free with you, while asking for title on your home, and you dislike his friends. His current means of income depends on your asset (a car).\n\nIt is pretty clear he isn't contributing to the living situation, but what is he contributing to this relationship? \n\nAsk yourself that question honestly. Does he go above and beyond in any area? Because you certainly are by housing him, cooking for him and cleaning for him.\n\nYou have a choice here: \n\nTo be with someone who doesn't want to be a PARTNER ie contribute in many ways, not just financial, and who does not understand that this conversation is you protecting yourself, rather than judging him.\n\nOR\n\nBe single and living the life you really want. \n\nHe is showing you his true colors. He is gaslighting you by saying you're an AH when you refuse him an insane request. \n\nYes, it has been 3 years, and you're invested. But do you honestly expect him to make significant changes in the next 3 years? I think you know the answer to that.\n\nIn three more years, he will be 40, under-employed, not going to college and trying to mooch off someone else.\n\nYou, on the other hand, will be 31, in a great job, in your own house (with less bills), and be living your life to the fullest.", "I talk to my kitties and although they don't do chores but they bring mouse for us as gift.  They also bring us lots of joys and laughter.  I am not kidding, if I am choosing kitties and your partner, will absolutely choose kitties EVERY TIME.\n\nI don't want to be mean, but it's not really an excuse to lower your standard just to have someone to talk to.   His not a partner material and also doesn't sound reliable.  Sometimes we just have to admit we made wrong choices and cut the loss and move on.  Dragging it out for longer than 3 years is just doing you disservice.   Most importantly, please love yourself first.", "Honestly, that\u2019s BS. At his age, a lot of tertiary education institutions will offer intro courses based on mature age rather than look at academic history.", "He can learn a trade easily. But that takes effort to sign up at the community College for courses so he'll probably find an excuse on why he can't do that. \n\nWhy are you allowing yourself to be used by this dolt?????", "Most colleges don't give a crap about academic records for mature students.  A high school diploma will get him started at night school for a few classes.  That's an excuse, nothing more.", "How the hell could he afford that!? Lol, I was happy to get my 4080 and it was overpriced with all the Bitcoin crap! I should have waited. The crash was right around the corner.\n\nGirl you're being used pretty hard. I'm sorry.", "I\u2019m sure you will be more well off without him. I\u2019m going go guess that you\u2019ve been paying for all the groceries, and any dates. On top of this, you work and do all the housework.\n\nIf you have a child, do you really think he will help raise the child? Nope, all that will be work for you too.\n\nHe is almost 10 years older than you, and I don\u2019t see him getting a job anytime soon since he sees that he can get you to pay for everything, and do all the work.\n\nYTA to yourself, please get rid of this man and work on not being a doormat. It\u2019s hard to do, but you will be so much better off in the long run", "Mine had many friends and was a joy to all.\n\nAgain, this is probably not the ideal relationship and you should probably move on. Just if you care for him at all, make sure he's in good hands first - unless he is just a hanger on jerk lol.", "This right here.  You are enabling this relationship but for what reason is beyond me.  Run.  Run and never look back.  Value yourself enough to know the worth you\u2019re bringing to the table.", "I agree. It sounds like he realizes how little he brings to the table / how sweet a deal he currently has and he wants them to have a kid together so OP can\u2019t easily leave him (if she one day wakes up and sees sense).", "The bar is literally in hell.  I\u2019m not mean to OP either, can I get on that title??", "...I somehow initially missed that this man is nearing 40. Good lord.", "Thank you for this perspective. I think I needed to hear it. He had roommates before being with me and always blamed his life on his roommates making his life depressing.", "He's giving you excuses. He is a moocher.\n\nHe has no incentive to be better because you pay for everything and also do all the house work. He just gets to play games all day long and blame others for his failure. \n\nIf he was legit taking care of the house, applying for jobs, trying to go back into college or showing you in any way shape or form that he was using the free time to improve his/both of yours quality of life, it would be one thing. Now he wants the ultimate mooching off. To be added to the deed without contributing a dime so he gets guaranteed 50% off your hard work. And believe me. He will likely change once he either gets you pregnant or gets in the deed because it will, to his eyes, guarantee you can't just kick him to the curb. He is trying to bind you to him.\n\nNTA. But seriously. You deserve better.", "Just keep tolerating being the sole breadwinner, cook, and cleaner of the house. Maybe you\u2019ll get tired of it one day and he\u2019ll move on to the next woman to care for him", "So what\u2019s his reason now?", "What\u2019s the reason he can\u2019t be motivated now?", "Luckily there isn't. He has brought up the need for me to have a will (never said to him) but he doesn't know that I already have one and have my sister on it, along with having my sister on life and mortgage insurance.", "I am already considering leaving him. I expect he would promise to change then complain and say he has no where to go but end up at a friends or his parents if I did break up.", "Tbh I have been busy with my work and I did not give all this much thought since doing chores did not inconvenience me and I was not struggling due to his lack of contribution as I make around 300k myself. The request for a kid and the house was a wake up call to me and I cant believe he is not grateful for all I have been doing and wants more.", "Considering he pays no rent or bills and rarely even buys groceries and saves what he makes from Uber was enough.

There\u2019s lots of people who are nice and I enjoy their company that I wouldn\u2019t pay their rent and have a child with them! Do better for yourself. You deserve better. NTA in this situation", "I suggest you look into your states divorce and family courts laws. You could be on the i bc lol to take care of him so he can take care of your baby for the next 18-21 years! Do not financially tie yourself legally to someone who is lazy and otherwise doesn\u2019t even do enough to keep shelter over their own selves.", "He can tell he\u2019s overplayed his hand and he\u2019s scrambling to keep his free ride going without actually having to do anything.", "Girl, he's doing the bare minimum to keep you. Why settle for that, when you could be with someone who goes out of their way to improve for you?", "The bar is in hell I see.", "It\u2019s been three years. How much of your life are you willing to waste on someone who isn\u2019t willing to take any initiative to be a functional adult? 5 years? 10?

This is not a man looking to change. He's 38 and is contributing zero to his own well being let alone yours.\n\nYou sound like your life is fantastic, why are you putting up with this?

Do not give him the chance to pretend to change.", "I think you are predicting that quite correctly. Plus...do you want to be in a relationship built on an ultimatum? \n\nI dated a guy kind of like your dude. He was older than me (I was a few years older than you at the time), he had had his shit together at one point but sure didn't by the time I knew him, and it was definitely a \"good time when we're with each other\" situation. The specific manipulation involved was different from your relationship (love-bombing versus desire to have a child ASAP), but somewhat parallel. If you feel like you're carrying the whole emotional, domestic, and economic weight of the relationship *and* bailing a sinking ship, well, get to the lifeboat now. We're with you in spirit! Don't wait the six months or year or three years.", "Don\u2019t do it. I speak from experience, do NOT trust him to take care of a child or a household.

Still, I kept him as a fwb only because he's a high school dropout who only worked part time dead end jobs. \n\nHe wanted to be my official boyfriend. I agreed but with a bunch of conditions. He knew I'd walk if conditions weren't met. \n\nHe shaped up step by step. Got his driver's license. Applied to college. Graduated college. Got a full-time job with benefits and car. \n\n2 years ago he moved into my house and signed a co-habitation agreement.

You really need to open your eyes about the danger that you are in. Do you think he is going to go away silently if you dump him. And do you think he hasn't figured out something to get money from you if not kids some other way. You are still talking about second chances and making excuses for him. Find a better partner.

It's not on you that he has no savings, backup plan, etc. Youre not responsible for him. \n\nI saw some other place you mentioned giving him a timeframe to show some progress. It could be one way to encourage him, but it would be short lived if anything. \n\nHe doesn't have any internal motivation (or self-respect?). Even if he tried to clean his act up, it would be because he feels he has to for you, not for himself. \n\nDon't enable him.
