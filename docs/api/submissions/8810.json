He lives with me in my apartment and I pay all of our bills, own both of our cars. I work as a software engineer and make a good salary, he is currently unemployed but does Uber with one of my cars and has previously worked part time jobs. He pays for gas for the car but I do most of the maintenance and pay insurance. I also do most of the house work because while he is willing to help, he always cooks badly, loads the dishwasher badly etc and it becomes easier for me to just do it myself. It is an apartment so this is not a major issue for me and I can manage although I would sure appreciate if he contributed more but I love him otherwise.\n\nRecently we had a talk about our future, talked about kids etc. He mentioned wanting a kid soon and that for the child's security he wants to be added to the title of my apartment which I am still paying a mortgage for. He said he could contribute to the mortgage in proportion to his income.\n\nI got quite annoyed at this and I thought this was unfair and said unless he pays me back half of my down-payment, mortgage payments up to now and mortgage advance payments I would not do this. He has little savings as he spends on things like upgrading his PC every generation, and sometimes loses money on stocks.\n\nI told him this and brought up other things like me doing most of the housework, and that his current Uber gig was only possible since I paid for the car.\n\nHe called me an AH and said that it was unfair and that couples should contribute in proportion to their capacity and he cannot get high paying jobs as me as he is a college drop out and is that I was rude since I could have just said no instead of belittling him about his finances which he is already insecure about.\n\nI feel like he opened the can of worms and I have never previously complained about the financial imbalance and have been supportive and understanding about my higher earning potential and already help him out enough by having bought our cars and paying most bills.", "created_utc": 1675215160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qgu1f/aita_for_not_belittling_my_bf_about_his_finances/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need more from a partner because they're supposed to be a PARTNER, not a roommate who makes you feel good.\n\nI would reconsider the relationship, honestly. He's almost 40. What's he gonna do for retirement in 20-25 years? Are you planning to make enough for both of you? Even if he dropped out of college, that was like 20 years ago. What skills has he developed since?

Hell I\u2019m sure the guy in the drive thru isn\u2019t mean either and at least he has a job.", "Why would he do either of those when you pay him to laze about and do nothing?", "> I ideally want to be supportive.  \n\nIdeally he wouldn't had asked to be added to the title, yet here we are.", ">He is not mean and we have a good time when we are with each other.\n\nSatan called.  He's tired of tripping over your standards and requests you set them higher.", "\"He is not mean.\"\n\nThat's a really low bar, you know. Best of luck with all this.", "It is generally unadvisable to approach a relationship in the hope your partner will change.\n\nIs there a will or a consistent effort on his part to try to change? It won't happen by itself.", "Why do you think he will change?\n\nHe has you doing all the housework and paying all the bills. Why on earth would he do anything differently?", "PLEASE protect your birth control method, OP! I\u2019m worried he will try baby trapping you\u2026", "I don't know what kind of birth control you use, but if it's something like pills, I'd be careful of sabotage. He wants a child to tie you to him. He already does nothing now, so you know he's not going to do anything even remotely related to childcare.", "Before we dated and  before he moved in he did have an apartment with roommates but he did not get along with them and claims it was a reason at the time he could not be motivated.", "He\u2019d just find another Bang Maid.", "You already have a child. A very old one.", "Does he get high and drive?   Open your eyes.", "He\u2019s 37. He\u2019s not going to change.", "Of course he doesn\u2019t want finances brought because he\u2019s the slacker in that department.\nListen, living in your house & driving your cars & contributing very little. Do you really need this in your life? I think you could do so much better.", "You need to question harder. There\u2019s nothing wrong with not making as much as your partner, but there is something wrong with someone who makes excuses and doesn\u2019t even try to better themselves. I know plenty of people who never finished college and have solid careers. Those same people work hard at being an equal partner in their relationships too.\n\nHere\u2019s a joke for you: men get with women thinking they\u2019ll never change and they always do, and women get with men thinking they\u2019ll change and they never do.", "And you believe that? Don't have kids with this guy and don't put him on the mortgage. Maybe consider why you're willing to be in a relationship with someone who's clearly using you.", "I dropped out my second semester of college, and decided to go back at the age of 36. The only thing that\u2019s stopping him from going back is probably the fact that he can\u2019t get you to do the work for him.\n\nETA: NTA, but girl the weaponized incompetence in this post is so strong, I smell it through my phone.", "That's bs.  You can get into a community college and work your way back up.  You've bought every excuse.", "He can try. Community colleges are fairly accepting of grades and students with different experiences.", "County colleges are a great place to start. He can get an associates for fairly cheap, get a great GPA, and go somewhere to get a bachelors after if he needs it", "Sounds like he has an excuse for everything.", "It sounds like he\u2019s always got an excuse...", "A dog is decent company.", "These are not qualities of a long term partner. Nothing you\u2019ve described seems to indicate building a life with him. \n\nLike Im not even talking about passion. Just in general nothing youve described really exudes excitement for your future together. Or a plan. \n\nFrom this very brief description I\u2019ll say you seem to be on autopilot with this relationship. \n\n\nNTA but seriously consider your future and what you need/want from a partner. It doesnt have to be loads of money etc. But ambitions, goals for themselves and the family they would want to have. Even if it is him being a stay at home dad.", "Is that really all you want from a partner? A warm body with a grasp of language?", "This comment....all day long.", "I know this and I am not budging on that. I kept my finances separate as I have seen people ruined by this.", "He took on different part time jobs, and at the time he did not want to go back to school as he was not mentally ready, recently he has expressed that he is more willing to do so and will look into it soon. But I do not think he has taken any concrete steps.", "It seems like the answer to all of that could be no. I am scared that if I give him an ultimatum he would temporarily change then get back to being lazy again.", "I did not see it that way, I hoped he would be grateful and use it to better himself. I know what it is like to be stressed paycheck to paycheck when I was in college and I thought alleviating that stress could help him grow. I seem mistaken in his case.\n\nI have financially supported one of my best friends to get back on her feet, complete college and she did and paid me back years later. I hoped he would too.", "There have been some general improvements compared to when he first moved in but it is really really slow.  He now at least admits there is a problem and says he will try which he did not previously. So far has not taken much action though.", "Right, he\u2019s literally contributing nothing but some good vibes to this situation. No productivity, just what I assume to be gaming on the PC and having wild fantasies about things he can\u2019t afford.", "I will, a kid is not happening and I am not that naive. If I did get pregnant I would 100% abort. Anyway intimacy is of the table until I decide what to do about this and whether to end it.", "It is not happening, I would immediately get an abortion if it ever did.", "Sounds like he never admits his own faults.", "I am not planning to have kids anytime soon and I would not with him unless he changed. If I had kids I would probably adopt.\n\nI am slightly questioning the relationship at the moment and have already told myself if he does not improve within a given time frame it is over.", "At the time when we started dating maybe yes. But I do not want that long term.", "He's not mean?  That's the low bar you're willing to set?", "I think it\u2019s time to take a \u201cconditional support\u201d stance. Concrete limits must be set on your support. It\u2019s not unfair to want to see progress on a promise he\u2019s made.", "He's not mentally ready for college, but wants to talk about having kids soon?  Oh hell no.  He's an anchor.  No more chances. You need to move on and move him out.", "He's 37, yes people can change hit at that point you are who you fundamentally are. He's shown you who he is, and you should believe him. He won't he going back to school or learning a trade because he would have already if he wanted to...also decent conversation and we travel? You gotta up your standards or U WBTA to yourself. Honestly the title thing just seems like him figuring out what boundaries he can push to keep lazing about and get what he can from you while he can", "The person has to WANT to do better. In his case you would see him working his ass off at home to make your life easier and better because of how much you are doing for him. But this guy is content to let you pay for everything AND do all the work at home? He doesn\u2019t have your best interest at heart.", "So he\u2019s not actually trying then. Words are useless without action.", "He's already had a TON of time.  You are putting a better life  (without him) on hold for him, and he's using weaponized incompetence on you.  Is that fair or right?  DTMFA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Please make sure you are watching your birth control so you don't end up paying him child support and housing him for the next 18 years.", "I try not to go straight to \u201cbreak up\u201d but just think, if he wasn\u2019t there anymore, she still wouldn\u2019t live with someone who would be mean to her.", "That is my plan, but to be honest I need some time to decide. I will not let it go on like it is, but I am deciding if I should give one last chance with conditional support or cut my losses and break up.\n\nIt might be shallow to say but I can easily find someone else, I work in a male dominated industry with many single men, I get asked out on the street all the time and have decent looks and fitness.", "I am and I am not going to be intimate for a while anymore until I decide whether to dump him or get him an ultimatum to change. I would abort if that every happened.", "I'm baffled as to why you've settled for this deadbeat. You 'hope' he gets a part time job soon? A hope without a plan is a pipe dream.\n\nYou pay all the bills, you do all the chores... What does he actually do all day?", "He's 37 and found his meal ticket. He's not going to change.", "I don't know, I was a little lonely when I moved to this city and he I guess I had hope and enjoyed the company.", "Him not being mean to you is literally the bare minimum. We don\u2019t keep people in our lives who are mean to us!  Your partner should be far and above \u201cnot mean\u201d and a big part of that is contributing to the relationship. He\u2019s ten years older than you and STILL a deadbeat/freeloader.  His income is directly linked to you. Now you\u2019re established in this city and you\u2019re realizing you deserve more.  Thank him for the experience and move on", "what about him do you actually like? what are his positive qualities?"]}
