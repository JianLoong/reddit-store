It is great that you help when you can but that should be all that is expected.", "NTA. You offered your parents a fair solution in being willing to sell your care if they make up the difference. You don't need a family friendly car for your job and you spent what you could afford. If they want an extra car for you to drive family around, they need to supply it.", "**NTA.** This sums up the situation here:  \n\n\n>they want me to sell my car and buy something more family friendly. I said I would if they covered the price difference and extra fuel costs. They did not think that was fair.\n\nSo if you can't afford a full blown SUV, what exactly do they want you to do???", "NTA\n\nYou bought a car with your money that meets your needs. If they wanted a say, they should have offered some money to help you buy something else.", "NTA. Stick with the smart car. They don't want to help with the costs. Who do you think would be paying for the gas in the bigger car. Your per diem only goes so far.", "NTA. They are trying to \"parentify\" you right now by asking you to buy a car to suit their needs! Keep the smart car. They've figured it out this long, they can keep figuring it out.", "NTA\n\nYou're young and just starting to build your adult life. You certainly don't need some gas guzzling giant vehicle. Personally, I think you made a smart and economical choice. Enjoy the new ride that you can more easily afford, and bonus points for choosing something a bit more environmentally friendly!", "NTA", "NTA and your demands are more than fair. And if it's the best car for your needs and within your means then it's absolutely not useless.", "NTA. You buy the car you need for yourself. Well done for finishing college without financial help from your parents. You sound like a person who respect your parents but at the same time acknowledge that you are not responsible for your siblings. Best of luck going forwards!", "NTA - this is your car.\nYou bought it to suit your needs within your budget.", "Nta but your parents are. Hauling their children around is their responsibility.  They are parenting you by expecting you to spend on a larger car to haul the kids around. Wake up!  Stand your ground.  You bought yourself a car that works for you. You do not need to buy a family car for their convenience.", "NTA. If they want you to have a larger car so badly- especially since they want to basically use it- they can pay you to cover it.", "NTA\n\nBe helpful when you are not working and you'll still be able to drive around one kid at a time. \n\nIt's just for the summer and then your off to finish college and start your career. It doesn't make sense for you to buy a family vehicle for such a short window of time. \n\nDo your parents not have a vehicle for transporting all the kids?", "NTA, if they want to use your car they should help pay for the car. If they don't like it, you're an adult and can spend your time and money however you want.\n\nAlso, I've seen a few comments asking if the decision to buy a smart car was the right decision or not for YOU. Even if that was a mistake, it doesn't make you TH in this situation.", "NTA. One less fat, oversized, useless SUV on the roads.", "NTA- tell them this car works for you for now, that maybe in the future, when you need it and have more money you will get something else, but for now you are happy that you are saving your money for the future. (you will most likely be able to sell it for a good price and maybe even get your money back, those cars have great resell value)", "ESH.  You bought a car based on how you will use it this summer.  And on that basis, I think you made a wise choice.  But only if you planned to trade it for something different in a few months, after your internship ends.  When buying a car, you need to consider your transportation needs for as long as you will own the car.  Buying a car to plan to own it for just a few months is not logical.  But then buying a smart car based on \"it's perfect for my lifestyle this summer\" is criminal lack of situational awareness.  \n\nFor long-term use for a single person, the most practical vehicle is a 5-door hatchback.  Think Hyundai I30 or Ford Focus or similar.  When you need to, you can carry a few passengers.  When you need to, you can carry a surprising amount of cargo.  And yet, most of the time you drive it (alone, and not carrying cargo) it will still be incredibly cheap to own and operate in terms of fuel, insurance, etc.\n\nBut your family expecting you to buy a car for THEIR needs?  RIDICULOUS!!!  The smart car was a questionable choice, but a worse choice would be a truck or SUV.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
