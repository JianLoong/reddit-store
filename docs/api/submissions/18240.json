And on that basis, I think you made a wise choice.  But only if you planned to trade it for something different in a few months, after your internship ends.  When buying a car, you need to consider your transportation needs for as long as you will own the car.  Buying a car to plan to own it for just a few months is not logical.  But then buying a smart car based on \"it's perfect for my lifestyle this summer\" is criminal lack of situational awareness.  \n\nFor long-term use for a single person, the most practical vehicle is a 5-door hatchback.  Think Hyundai I30 or Ford Focus or similar.  When you need to, you can carry a few passengers.  When you need to, you can carry a surprising amount of cargo.  And yet, most of the time you drive it (alone, and not carrying cargo) it will still be incredibly cheap to own and operate in terms of fuel, insurance, etc.\n\nBut your family expecting you to buy a car for THEIR needs?  RIDICULOUS!!!  The smart car was a questionable choice, but a worse choice would be a truck or SUV.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rent a huge moving van for hundreds of dollars?  (If you do, how do you move the car?)  Hire a moving company for thousands of dollars?  Even though I had a lot of stuff, I  could move myself with several trips with my hatchback.  Cost?  About 10 bucks' worth of fuel, if that much.
