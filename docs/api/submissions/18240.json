And if it's the best car for your needs and within your means then it's absolutely not useless.", "NTA. You buy the car you need for yourself.

You sound like a person who respect your parents but at the same time acknowledge that you are not responsible for your siblings. Best of luck going forwards!", "NTA - this is your car.\nYou bought it to suit your needs within your budget.", "Nta but your parents are. Hauling their children around is their responsibility.  They are parenting you by expecting you to spend on a larger car to haul the kids around. Wake up!  Stand your ground.  You bought yourself a car that works for you.

If they don't like it, you're an adult and can spend your time and money however you want.\n\nAlso, I've seen a few comments asking if the decision to buy a smart car was the right decision or not for YOU.

(you will most likely be able to sell it for a good price and maybe even get your money back, those cars have great resell value)", "ESH.  You bought a car based on how you will use it this summer.  And on that basis, I think you made a wise choice.  But only if you planned to trade it for something different in a few months, after your internship ends.  When buying a car, you need to consider your transportation needs for as long as you will own the car.  Buying a car to plan to own it for just a few months is not logical.  But then buying a smart car based on \"it's perfect for my lifestyle this summer\" is criminal lack of situational awareness.  \n\nFor long-term use for a single person, the most practical vehicle is a 5-door hatchback.  Think Hyundai I30 or Ford Focus or similar.  When you need to, you can carry a few passengers.  When you need to, you can carry a surprising amount of cargo.  And yet, most of the time you drive it (alone, and not carrying cargo) it will still be incredibly cheap to own and operate in terms of fuel, insurance, etc.\n\nBut your family expecting you to buy a car for THEIR needs?  RIDICULOUS!!!  The smart car was a questionable choice, but a worse choice would be a truck or SUV.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I was in my 20's, I had a 5-door hatchback and to my lifestyle at the time it was worth its weight in gold.  At that time, you are typically living in apartments and changing jobs often, requiring you to move often.  How are you going to move with a 2-seater?  Rent a huge moving van for hundreds of dollars?  (If you do, how do you move the car?)  Hire a moving company for thousands of dollars?  Even though I had a lot of stuff, I  could move myself with several trips with my hatchback.  Cost?  About 10 bucks' worth of fuel, if that much.  If your daughter intends to live with you for her entire life, that is the only scenario where a 2-seater might be a practical consideration.  Because a 2-seater doesn't save significant money compared to a 4-seater.", "What would you consider a reasonable small car with a similar size and fuel economy to the Smart?", "My daughter lives by herself for the last several years. Moving means that you rent a U-haul for cheap. If you move across country you rent a U-haul with trailer for your car. Moving furniture with a hatchback isn\u2019t possible anyhow. Smaller cars use less gas and are fun to drive.", "If the parents wished their offer of free rent to have contingencies, those should have been spelled out so the OP can make an informed decision.", "What type of informed decision would that be?  He\u2019s living at home for free.  There\u2019s no decision to make.
