It is great that you help when you can but that should be all that is expected.", "NTA. You offered your parents a fair solution in being willing to sell your care if they make up the difference. You don't need a family friendly car for your job and you spent what you could afford.

Keep the smart car. They've figured it out this long, they can keep figuring it out.", "NTA\n\nYou're young and just starting to build your adult life. You certainly don't need some gas guzzling giant vehicle. Personally, I think you made a smart and economical choice. Enjoy the new ride that you can more easily afford, and bonus points for choosing something a bit more environmentally friendly!", "NTA", "NTA and your demands are more than fair. And if it's the best car for your needs and within your means then it's absolutely not useless.", "NTA. You buy the car you need for yourself. Well done for finishing college without financial help from your parents. You sound like a person who respect your parents but at the same time acknowledge that you are not responsible for your siblings. Best of luck going forwards!", "NTA - this is your car.\nYou bought it to suit your needs within your budget.", "Nta but your parents are. Hauling their children around is their responsibility.  They are parenting you by expecting you to spend on a larger car to haul the kids around. Wake up!  Stand your ground.  You bought yourself a car that works for you. You do not need to buy a family car for their convenience.", "NTA. If they want you to have a larger car so badly- especially since they want to basically use it- they can pay you to cover it.", "NTA\n\nBe helpful when you are not working and you'll still be able to drive around one kid at a time. \n\nIt's just for the summer and then your off to finish college and start your career. It doesn't make sense for you to buy a family vehicle for such a short window of time. \n\nDo your parents not have a vehicle for transporting all the kids?", "NTA, if they want to use your car they should help pay for the car. If they don't like it, you're an adult and can spend your time and money however you want.\n\nAlso, I've seen a few comments asking if the decision to buy a smart car was the right decision or not for YOU. Even if that was a mistake, it doesn't make you TH in this situation.", "NTA. One less fat, oversized, useless SUV on the roads.", "NTA- tell them this car works for you for now, that maybe in the future, when you need it and have more money you will get something else, but for now you are happy that you are saving your money for the future. (you will most likely be able to sell it for a good price and maybe even get your money back, those cars have great resell value)", "ESH.  You bought a car based on how you will use it this summer.  And on that basis, I think you made a wise choice.  But only if you planned to trade it for something different in a few months, after your internship ends.  When buying a car, you need to consider your transportation needs for as long as you will own the car.  Buying a car to plan to own it for just a few months is not logical.  But then buying a smart car based on \"it's perfect for my lifestyle this summer\" is criminal lack of situational awareness.  \n\nFor long-term use for a single person, the most practical vehicle is a 5-door hatchback.  Think Hyundai I30 or Ford Focus or similar.  When you need to, you can carry a few passengers.  When you need to, you can carry a surprising amount of cargo.  And yet, most of the time you drive it (alone, and not carrying cargo) it will still be incredibly cheap to own and operate in terms of fuel, insurance, etc.\n\nBut your family expecting you to buy a car for THEIR needs?  RIDICULOUS!!!  The smart car was a questionable choice, but a worse choice would be a truck or SUV.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now, if they wanted to help you that's a different story but as you have already said they think that isn't fair. \n\nSo, it also isn't fair for them to just expect you to buy a new car because they want you to. They are acting entitled to, well, your life. You're not their live in nanny or babysitter, just the oldest child (unfortunately though that is what you become to most parents, the babysitter)\n\nYou should want to help your family but, that goes both ways.

When I was young and single I drove a tiny car and I miss it! But with kids, always on the go with extracurriculars, big dog, camping, etc. I now need my bigger SUV to handle our daily life (heck, I fill the entire cargo space when doing a single Costco run as it's a 5 hrs return trip to the nearest one).

You wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford the car if you had had to pay rent.", "There are likely times when they need to be different places at the same time, potentially sometimes with additional kids to transport depending on carpooling.
