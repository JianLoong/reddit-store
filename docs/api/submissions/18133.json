We\u2019ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn\u2019t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. \n\nSome background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. \n\nI found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn\u2019t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. \n\nAfter finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.\n\nI was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn\u2019t bother him.\n\nLast night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.\n\nHis best female friend Jessica laughed and said \u201cI wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.\u201d\n\nI looked at her with an \u201cexcuse me?\u201d Look on my face and she just said \u201cnevermind\u201d and walked away. \n\nI confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote \u201cshe\u2019s just messing with you. You can\u2019t take a joke?\u201d\n\nSo I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said \u201cwell, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.\u201d \n\nI asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said \u201cyou know\u2026messing with best friends?\u201d \n\nHe then pat me on the shoulder and said that it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m not who I was back then and if he could get over my \u201ccolourful past\u201d and \u201cthot mentalities\u201d to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica\u2019s comments and give her another chance.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.\n\nHe was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn\u2019t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.\n\nI thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they\u2019re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. \n\nI responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn\u2019t a \u201cthot\u201d and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. \n\nHe started screaming how I\u2019m \u201cthe biggest AH\u201d for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my \u201ccolourful past.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m thinking maybe taking it back went too far. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685019627, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rh62c/aita_for_returning_a_birthday_gift_i_got_for_my/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no need for you to feel badly about who you dated and frankly it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business. The fact that your BF not only judged you, but also shared his judgement with friends is inexcusable. You don\u2019t do hurtful things like that to people you care about.

Nothing about your past is even colorful. Omg you dated 2 guys that happened to be friends good heavens where are my pearls?!  I must clutch them!

You might have dated friends, but he dated his best friend\u2019s ex. That\u2019s on them to figure out, and Adam\u2019s mistake only.\n\n2) Where I come from, dating 3 dudes in 7 years does not a \u201ccolorful\u201d past make.

Especially not over the \u201cmistake\u201c of not checking whether a person you were dating happened to know the person you briefly dated before them.", "Nta.  He's a giant entitled jerk.  He's been telling his friends bad things about you... Things you didn't even know at the time, and making judgments about your character.  This is all behavior from him.  You were justified in taking the gift back and should reconsider the relationship.

Run like hell. Any guy that will openly bash you about your past that he so called accepted when you two first got together isn't worth being in a relationship with.

He is, a big one, using your past to lift himself up as the guy how accepts you!?!?

No regrets. And no accepting trash people like this guy and his friends.\n\nAlso, they are mad for the PS5, they don't care about you.

It was meant to be insulting. They think you are beneath them despite the fact that you are a million times better if a person than they are. \n\nAnd as to your past, I don\u2019t even understand how anyone could be so moronic as to think you did anything wrong. You didn\u2019t date friends at the same time. You briefly dated a person who happened to know someone you used to briefly date. So what. \n\nThe fact that he would find it reflected on you in any way is ridiculous.

Who says that to the person you're supposedly in love with? Also, it was only two guys? For a couple of months a time, and then when you realized what had happened you took a break. That's nothing...

We\u2019ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn\u2019t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. \n\nSome background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. \n\nI found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn\u2019t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. \n\nAfter finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.\n\nI was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that the I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn\u2019t bother him.\n\nLast night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.\n\nHis best female friend Jessica laughed and said \u201cI wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.\u201d\n\nI looked at her with an \u201cexcuse me?\u201d Look on my face and she just said \u201cnothing\u201d and walked away. \n\nI confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote \u201cshe\u2019s just messing with you. You can\u2019t take a joke?\u201d\n\nSo I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said \u201cwell, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.\u201d \n\nI asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said \u201cyou know\u2026messing with best friends?\u201d \n\nHe then pat me on the shoulder and said that it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m not who I was back then and if he could get over my \u201ccolourful past\u201d and \u201cthot mentalities\u201d to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica\u2019s comments and give her another chance.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.\n\nHe was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn\u2019t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.\n\nI thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they\u2019re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. \n\nI responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn\u2019t a \u201cthot\u201d and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. \n\nHe started screaming how I\u2019m \u201cthe biggest AH\u201d for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my \u201ccolourful past.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m thinking maybe taking it back went too far. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He isn't mature enough to handle you. \n\nAdditionally, for future relationships, this is isnt that big a deal. You dated friends who you didnt know were friends. So what, no biggie. I think if you feelnlike its no big deal, that may help them (potential bfs) see that its also not a biggie.\n\nAlso NTA", "He is literally insulting her behind her back to his friends and thinks she's the problem? OP you deserve better.", "Or shes a jealous female friend who wishes she was with him. But seems like they are close enough that they name-call his gf behind her back so you\u2019re probably right", "OMG I hope you don't mind me stealing this beauty of a line - dollars to dildos. I love it", "I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a thing, sounds like the friendgroup is just a bunch of weenies.", "She took that PS5 back. We wish you and your money a nice happily ever after.", "Right? It's not like she worked her way through an entire football team )and even if she had who cares). Those people are AH to the highest. Good on you for leaving OP you deserve better!!", "I think it's just called \"dating.\"", "Agreed that's not a colorful past.... you deserve so much better than this man.", "Anyone want to bet Jessica has a bit of a thing for her bff Mike?", "Lol at item 1! I agree with you wholeheartedly, and that's a great metaphor hehe", "\u201cAs colourful as a zebra\u201d\nLove it \ud83d\ude02", "Even if he was a virgin, wouldn\u2019t excuse such a shitty behaviour and backstabbing.", "Exactly this.  He doesn't respect her. I'm glad OP respected herself enough to walk away.", "I hope so! OP shouldn't spend one minute or one penny on that shitty guy.", "And even if he was a full fledged virgin until being with OP, he still doesn't have any business judging her past.", "That would be epic...", "She didn't even really f up because she didn't know her two exes were friends. She didn't intentionally date her first ex's (best) friend.\n\nThat whole friend group of OP's 3rd ex is trash.\n\nNTA", "One of my sister's friends dated brothers. She broke up with the eldest after a couple of weeks, I believe \u2014 it was very short-lived. A few months later, she dated the youngest brother (the brothers are only about a year apart, to clarify). She ended up marrying him. Everyone is the family knows and jokes about it. They told me the day I met them. Dating siblings, cousins, best friends doesn't always have to be melodramatic. Context matters.", "Exactly. Her \"past\" is pretty much a non issue. To think less of herself and have her boyfriend make fun of her behind her back? That's crap. NTA. The boyfriend got what he deserved, and OP can do so much better.", "I was wondering the same thing...", "I would say she doesn\u2019t have self esteem issues since she got up and left the party and told her now ex to date someone else. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t even read the story \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Are you the bf?", "are you talking about the bf?", "What past? Dating two men she\u2019s didn\u2019t know were friends? Wow\u2026what a skeleton.", "oh found the bf", "Found the incel!", "Oh please, shut up you asshole. \n\nYes he did insult her. \n\nShe is 26, dating 2 guys is hardly being colorful.", "That's not \"a past\"... that's just life...", "What's the truth? What did she even do? What is her \"past\"?\n\nA few years ago I dated a guy with brown hair, does that also constitute a shameful \"past\"?", "hey man respectfully, do you have a brain injury?", "a while ago, she dated two guys who so happened to be friends while not knowing they were friends. And so what if she knew anyway?\n\nShe dated 1 dude when she was 18 for 3 months, broke up, met another one after, dated him for 2 months, broke up with him, then no one for 2 years then she met Mike. How is that colorful? Because she's not a virgin?\n\nYou could make an effort to actually thinly veil the misogyny.", "Yup. Here is the BF!", "Have you lost your virginity?", "shit just my last summer would have this man calling a priest or something, she can do so much better than this man", "100%. He\u2019s one of those individuals who has to reimagine things to make him seem like he\u2019s being very generous.", "If they haven't- Jessica wants to at the very least.", "Nah. He's with OP because she can afford PS5s and Jessica can't. That means Jessica stays friend zoned (or a side piece) as long as someone 'better' is around.", "Lol! Take it and use it frequently \u2764\ufe0f", "Easy money.", "The fact that she even considers that taking it back is going too far tells me she's planning to go back to him. That's low", "If I were would I want her to have higher self esteem?", "He doesn't care.  No one actually cares.", "Lol. Yup. And I wouldn't care either.  But it happened, she admitted that she did it.  Should he now lie about it and say she never did it?", "Believe it or not, straight to hell.", "He said she slept with 2 friends. Did she not do that?   No, she admitted that she did to that.  \n\nAnd does he care?   No. He doesn't care.", "Dropped as a baby and fell into the incel bin.", "Yeah this is my impression too.", "This right here is the answer.", "if he doesn't care, why did he tell his friends and why did he scream so much about him being a nice guy for overlooking her colorful past, when it isn't even beige in the first place?\n\nA girl OP barely knows called her \"that ho over there\" because, 2 years before she met Mike, she met two guys who knew each other. \n\nMike described OP to his friends as a ho.\n\nThat's not how a boyfriend acts.", "He sure is making a lot of effort in telling everyone he doesn't care. I mean how could his friends know he doesn't care besides never mentioning it, but then they wouldn't know he doesn't care.", "the bf is literally the ah dude. he and his friends are exaggerating ops past.", "Name checks out\u2026", "Ok but like...why does that even matter?"]}
