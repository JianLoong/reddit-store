Including my best friend as the maid of honor. They all said yes and I was pretty okay with having a smaller bridal party. My husband of course asked his best friend to be his best man. Some more context here is that I'm not particularly close with my fiances best friend's girlfriend. They've been together for 2 years but most of that they lived in another state. So I've only ever actually hung out with her one other time. \n\nToday we went over to their house so my fiance can pick something up from his best friend and the subject of our wedding came up. She asked me what color the bridesmaids dresses were gonna be and when she should show up to go shopping for them. I asked what she meant by that and she said that she wanted to clear it on her schedule with work. I got silent for a second and she said \"Well, because I'm gonna be in the wedding right?\" And I told her, honestly probably a little harsher than I should have, \"No, you're not a bridesmaid\" everyone got quiet and we left fairly quickly after that. My fiance told me that I should just let her be a bridesmaid. His best friend is texting him saying shes devastated. I just don't know her that well, and I'm not comfortable with a stranger being in my wedding party.

You have seen her a couple of times. Why would she assume she would be your bridesmaid?", "NTA that is a bizarre presumption on her part, and her bf texting your fianc\u00e9 that she is devastated so they can coerce her way into the wedding party is just as bad. It\u2019s too bad your fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t just speak up and say they\u2019ve don\u2019t know each other and we\u2019re having a small bridal party.", "NTA but I have to ask. Did your fiance imply to them that she would be a Bridesmaid?\n\nIt seems weird that your fiance is saying you should just make her a bridesmaid so I\u2019m just thinking (hopefully incorrectly) that he may have planted that seed.", "NTA \n\nIt was crazy for her to assume she was in your wedding. You don't know her well -- she has no right to be in your wedding. This is a \"just no.\"\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 may press you for fear his buddy will pull out. That's on him.", "Wth? Devastated over what? You've hung out with her one time. She should be grateful she is included as a *1 lol\nNTA at all. She sounds extremely entitled and I really hope you don't have to hang out with her a lot after you are married.", "What an odd thing to assume. NTA but if you want to try to smooth things over, so your husbands friendship isn\u2019t affected you could say something like \u201cI\u2019m really flattered you feel so close to me to want to be in my wedding party, but I\u2019ve chosen my brides maids already and want to keep it very tight, really looking forward to seeing you at the wedding and getting to know you better\u201d not that you owe her that, just sometimes it\u2019s good to suck up your pride and make nice with people who will regardless be in your life.", "My husband has been a best man when I was a regular guest. She\u2019s weird for assuming. The boys are weird for trying to go along with it. Don\u2019t cave. NTA.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. And why anyone would want to be a bridesmaid for someone they barely know is beyond strange\u2026", "NTA, did you force your fiance to take men you know has best men ? So why you should you take a stranger as bridesmaid ? They are suppose to spend many time with till the wedding and even make you a feast, so you can\u2019t enjoy with someone you don\u2019t, who doesn\u2019t know you ! It\u2019s crazy she thought that ! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. \n\nIt is his side. He can make her a groomswoman.", "NTA. you have the right to choose your bridesmaids based on your closest relationships, and it's understandable that you might feel uncomfortable having someone you don't know well in your bridal party. while your fiance and his best friend may have different expectations, it's ultimately your decision, and being honest about your comfort level makes complete sense, to me, at least", "NTA\n\nRidiculous enough assumption on her part, but truly ridiculous reaction from her boyfriend and your fianc\u00e9.\n\nPoint out to your fianc\u00e9 that you don\u2019t know her well enough to consider a friend just yet, let alone bridesmaid material. And point out that you have zero expectation that he have the boyfriends of your bridesmaids as groomsmen.", "This is BIZARRE AF\n\n>my fiance, my fiances best friend and his girlfriend all think I'm an asshole now. \n\n>My fiance told me that I should just let her be a bridesmaid\n\nOr, if it's so important to him, she can be a groomswoman. Because clearly she's someone important in his life... Right? He's not just trying to guilt you into having a near stranger as part of your bridal party... Right? And he's not just so spineless he's trying to keep the peace in regards to an absolutely ridiculous assumption and request... Right?\n\nNTA And honestly I'll be more upset at your fiance for not having your back. \n\nAlso, did someone tell her she was going to be in the bridal party? Like your fiance possibly? This is just so bizarre for someone to just assume they're going to be in the bridal party of someone they barely know and absolutely never talk to.", "NTA.

Period.", "NTA - She shouldn\u2019t have assumed she\u2019s the bridesmaid when you have only seen her one other time.", "Why would she assume she\u2019s in the wedding? Is there missing info? For now, NTA; I wouldn\u2019t assume I\u2019d be in any wedding, even if it was my nearest and dearest\u2019s, unless I was asked.", "NTA. In fact, just about everyone else is TA. Your fianc\u00e9e should stand up for you and hush his mouth with this crazy compromise talk. We do not negotiate with wedding hijackers.  Her BF should consider she likely doesn\u2019t trust him to walk down the aisle with another woman (or whatever crazy people say to cover that jealousy). She\u2019s just flat-out delusional/crazy.", "NTA. She's a stranger, why would she think she could be in your Bridal Party? Don't feel bad for being honest.", "NTA. Getting asked to be a bridesmaid is a big deal, and definitely something that isn\u2019t just implied. Even some sisters don\u2019t ask each other to be bridesmaids. What an entitled thing to assume you\u2019d be included in.", "NTA\n\n1. You choose  the bridesmaids not him.\n\n2. No one is automatically entitled to a spot in the bridal party, even if their partner is in the wedding.\n\n3. It\u2019s rude for her to assume she\u2019s a part of the wedding party without any sort of invitation from you. \n\n4. If your fianc\u00e9 feels she needs to be in the bridal party let him make her a groomsman.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. Who the hell just assumes they're gonna be a bridesmaid without even being asked? Sounds like she's trying to force her way into your life.", "NTA and why would she assume she\u2019s going to be a bridesmaid and y\u2019all aren\u2019t even friends lmao", "She's \"devastated\"??  Oh hell no. \n\nTell your fianc\u00e9:\n\n\"I have only met her twice and she is 'devastated' about not being in the wedding party of someone she barely knows?  This is so bizarre that I'm not even sure I want her to be allpwed to come as a Plus 1. You need to get your best friend to shut this shit down and I don't want to hear about it again or she is not even welcome as a guest.\"\n\nThis isn't your problem.\n\n1. Her boyfriend should have told her that was not reasonable... and never called your fianc\u00e9. \n\n2. Your fianc\u00e9 should have shut that down as crazy and it never should have reached your ears.\n\nIf you hear about it again you can say:\n\n\"Oh are we talking about Devastated Girl again? Remember what I said about not even including an invitation to her? Think carefully about whether you want to discuss her again. \n\nBY THE WAY:  Make it clear that you are not including her in any of your bridesmaid events and plans. No nail and hair events. No hanging out with the bride on the morning of wedding, etc.\n\nShe's a Plus 1 that you've met twice. If they come in from out of town you need to make it clear that they aren't sleeping in your spare room the night before your wedding. If anyone sleeps over it will be bridesmaids and fianc\u00e9 sleeps elsewhere.", "Very weird supposition, NTA at all.  Truly odd for her to assume she was going to be a bridesmaid.  That not how it works.", "NTA . She was rude to presume that she was one of your bridesmaids.", "You're not an asshole, just a tad bit rude. But hey, it's your wedding so do what you want I guess.
