My fiance was trying to avoid the huge fallout and subsequently the huge backlash she would try to create by asking me to just appease her. I put my foot down and said she can either come as a guest or not at all. He told me it was my Decision and he'll let his friend know. We haven't heard anything yet from them but I'm waiting for the tantrum. Wish me luck\n \nUpdate 2: So she is throwing a tantrum. The best man is texting my fiances other friends about the situation. He's day of she has been crying about it and I was unnecessarily rude and intentionally leaving her out because I'm jealous. Nobody is taking it though. I'm still standing my ground and we're rethinking the groomsmen now. \n\nThis happened today and my fiance, my fiances best friend and his girlfriend all think I'm an asshole now. \n\nMy fiance and I got engaged last month and the first thing I did after the excitment wore off was ask my 3 closest friends to be my bridesmaids. Including my best friend as the maid of honor. They all said yes and I was pretty okay with having a smaller bridal party. My husband of course asked his best friend to be his best man. Some more context here is that I'm not particularly close with my fiances best friend's girlfriend. They've been together for 2 years but most of that they lived in another state. So I've only ever actually hung out with her one other time. \n\nToday we went over to their house so my fiance can pick something up from his best friend and the subject of our wedding came up. She asked me what color the bridesmaids dresses were gonna be and when she should show up to go shopping for them. I asked what she meant by that and she said that she wanted to clear it on her schedule with work. I got silent for a second and she said \"Well, because I'm gonna be in the wedding right?\" And I told her, honestly probably a little harsher than I should have, \"No, you're not a bridesmaid\" everyone got quiet and we left fairly quickly after that. My fiance told me that I should just let her be a bridesmaid. His best friend is texting him saying shes devastated. I just don't know her that well, and I'm not comfortable with a stranger being in my wedding party. AITA?\n\nEDIT: My fiance didn't say or infer that she was gonna be a bridesmaid. She literally cooked that up herself, or maybe her boyfriend told her idk. \nThank you so much, I'm so glad other people thought her assumption was bizarre.

You have seen her a couple of times. Why would she assume she would be your bridesmaid?", "NTA that is a bizarre presumption on her part, and her bf texting your fianc\u00e9 that she is devastated so they can coerce her way into the wedding party is just as bad. It\u2019s too bad your fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t just speak up and say they\u2019ve don\u2019t know each other and we\u2019re having a small bridal party.", "NTA but I have to ask.

And he's not just so spineless he's trying to keep the peace in regards to an absolutely ridiculous assumption and request... Right?\n\nNTA And honestly I'll be more upset at your fiance for not having your back. \n\nAlso, did someone tell her she was going to be in the bridal party? Like your fiance possibly?

Remember what I said about not even including an invitation to her? Think carefully about whether you want to discuss her again. \n\nBY THE WAY:  Make it clear that you are not including her in any of your bridesmaid events and plans. No nail and hair events. No hanging out with the bride on the morning of wedding, etc.\n\nShe's a Plus 1 that you've met twice. If they come in from out of town you need to make it clear that they aren't sleeping in your spare room the night before your wedding.

Indeed, weddings are highly personal events, and couples should prioritize what makes them comfortable and happy. Decisions about the wedding party, including who will be a best man, bridesmaid, or other roles, are ultimately up to the couple getting married. While it's common for close friends or family members to be included, there's no strict rule about who must be part of the wedding party. Clear communication with all involved parties is crucial. If there are assumptions or expectations that may cause discomfort, it's often best to address them openly and honestly. Ensuring that everyone is on the same page can help avoid misunderstandings and make the wedding planning process smoother.

And that if we were to increase the party there were several women in my life who I was closer to and would choose before her.  We decided to ask her to be a part of the wedding ceremony in another capacity.  It was not good enough. The groomsman (very close relative to my fiance -now husband) backed out because his wife was so mad.\n\nEdit: up until then we were friendly, but not friends.
