Including my best friend as the maid of honor. They all said yes and I was pretty okay with having a smaller bridal party. My husband of course asked his best friend to be his best man. Some more context here is that I'm not particularly close with my fiances best friend's girlfriend. They've been together for 2 years but most of that they lived in another state. So I've only ever actually hung out with her one other time. \n\nToday we went over to their house so my fiance can pick something up from his best friend and the subject of our wedding came up. She asked me what color the bridesmaids dresses were gonna be and when she should show up to go shopping for them. I asked what she meant by that and she said that she wanted to clear it on her schedule with work. I got silent for a second and she said \"Well, because I'm gonna be in the wedding right?\" And I told her, honestly probably a little harsher than I should have, \"No, you're not a bridesmaid\" everyone got quiet and we left fairly quickly after that. My fiance told me that I should just let her be a bridesmaid. His best friend is texting him saying shes devastated. I just don't know her that well, and I'm not comfortable with a stranger being in my wedding party. AITA?\n\nEDIT: My fiance didn't say or infer that she was gonna be a bridesmaid. She literally cooked that up herself, or maybe her boyfriend told her idk. \nThank you so much, I'm so glad other people thought her assumption was bizarre.

You have seen her a couple of times.

It\u2019s too bad your fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t just speak up and say they\u2019ve don\u2019t know each other and we\u2019re having a small bridal party.", "NTA but I have to ask.

Remember what I said about not even including an invitation to her? Think carefully about whether you want to discuss her again. \n\nBY THE WAY:  Make it clear that you are not including her in any of your bridesmaid events and plans. No nail and hair events. No hanging out with the bride on the morning of wedding, etc.\n\nShe's a Plus 1 that you've met twice.

Indeed, weddings are highly personal events, and couples should prioritize what makes them comfortable and happy. Decisions about the wedding party, including who will be a best man, bridesmaid, or other roles, are ultimately up to the couple getting married. While it's common for close friends or family members to be included, there's no strict rule about who must be part of the wedding party. Clear communication with all involved parties is crucial. If there are assumptions or expectations that may cause discomfort, it's often best to address them openly and honestly. Ensuring that everyone is on the same page can help avoid misunderstandings and make the wedding planning process smoother. In the end, the couple should prioritize their own happiness and preferences when making decisions about their wedding day.", "No way, her assumption is cuckoo.

It was a strategy.  She\u2019s crying crocodile tears now because you didn\u2019t fall for her plan.\n\nThis is the first challenge to your marriage.  Is your fianc\u00e9 going to be loyal or succumb to peer pressure?", "NTA, but the situation could have been handled better if you had let her down in a light diplomatic way rather saying it like that to her face.", "NTA\n\nWtf??? Who is this girl???? \n\nYou don\u2019t assume that sort of role in a wedding!!!\n\nSet your fianc\u00e9 straight and make it clear to him that she\u2019s not in the wedding.

She\u2019s crazy for assuming she was part of the bridal party, & even if she did, bringing it up so directly/inelegantly was worse. You\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt is his side. He can make her a groomswoman.", "My husband was in his best friend\u2019s wedding a few years ago. We hung out with them a lot and the bride was a friend but not a best friend. We rarely hang out one on one. I did not assume I would be asked just because he was and I wasn\u2019t.", "Well if he's best man you would actually be the maid of honor, just fyi\n\n/S", "Nope. Someone else asked earlier and I asked him if he hinted at it or something and he said all he did was ask his best friend to be his best man and literally nothing else.", "Obviously you don\u2019t have to do that but it\u2019s just an idea. Edit: grammar", "She doesn't want to because this whole thing is kinda stupid. The girlfriend made an incorrect assumption. Maybe OP could have been more gentle about letting her down, but she wasn't actually wrong.\n\nAnd this goes both ways. If this girl, who is only just barely an acquaintance (OP has spoken to her 2-3 times) is allowed to demand to be in the wedding party... what about the boyfriends/husbands of OP'S bridesmaids? Who likely spends more time with the groom than OP has with this girl simply due to proximity?\n\nYou don't HAVE to submit to the whims of rude people just because they're sad when you don't.", "Yeah but she\u2019s still her girlfriend. I would assume that she is at least invited as a plus 1 so even if he was paired up it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll do anything other than maybe dance", "His response is just as bizarre as hers.", "Forgot to say NTA.", "Bridal shower is a no but bachelorette is a yes", "People like the girlfriend rely on forcing their way in and then being dramatic to get everyone dancing to their tune. And its working. The best man and groom are more focused on the needs of a virtual stranger than they are to the bride. Its best to be perfectly clear and leave no room for doubt. She'll exploit every crack.", "Plus, you wouldn't know the other bridesmaids either. It'd just be so awkward to have to do the initial get to know you stuff with a group that had known each other for a while in a context where it's normally assumed you already all know each other fairly well.", "No.  That's not how it works.  Lmao", "With that info I would say that she is a bit much to be assuming anything. Not all couples get to go together in wedding parties, nor do all family members. The day is about your marriage and not the happiness of others so if you don't feel okay with it then don't do it and let it stay at that, plus you don't know her so that'd be really strange!", "Some girlfriends are clingier than others and her deal may be \u2018well you can\u2019t be in the wedding party if I\u2019m not\u2019 so she just assumed she was.. would she have been invited as a guest?", "This may  be true(that he didn't offer or imply) but he did not stand behind you either.  That sucks.  \n\nMaybe ask him why he hasn't invited X(ie a cousin who is a stranger to him) into the wedding party so he understands why you don't want a virtual stranger", "Yeah that's just weird of her to assume she's in your wedding. Especially since you don't know her well.  NTA. She must be one of those girlfriends that thinks whatever boyfriend does she has to  be with him. Like he can't do anything without her being able to do it too.", "Nta at all she's unhinged and they are the AHS here for calling you an ah with her complete off the rails.\n\nGet your fiance to read the comments. It's nuts to expect to be in a stranger's wedding party and that's exactly what she is to you and you to her.gees\n\nTell her bf to get her to therapy or better a shrink.", "Oh, I agree with you totally but the result will be the same.", "Exactly.  This is just a glimpse of what married life is going to be like with him.", "Its a huge red flag. The best man really needs to take a look at who he is dating.", "I think that's exactly how sarcasm works \ud83d\ude08", "Nice woosh", "Yes she is the best mans plus 1", "She can\u2019t expect someone she barely knows to have her in the bridal party\u2026it\u2019s one thing if you\u2019ve all been hanging out and you both becoming closer during their relationship but you haven\u2019t so she\u2019s just that. His girlfriend and plus 1.. it\u2019s possible best friend told her \u2018yeah babe no worries you\u2019ll be a bridesmaid\u2019 if she gave him a hard time.."]}
