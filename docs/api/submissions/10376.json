We got seated and then we get assigned a waitress to serve us though the night, the issue is that me and her know each other so she was very rude towards me. \n\nI'll tell you what happened between us. Basically some dumb drama. I was dating a guy (m27), he never mentioned he was dating someone and didn't post on social media or something with a partner, his friends and family (that I got to know) never told me anything. We date for six months, at that time some girl came to his apartment while I was staying there and started telling at him, calling him a filthy cheater, you know that kind of stuff. She also yelled at me a lot of insults because she was confused and thought I knew he had a girlfriend, I assure her that I did not knew it and also got angry at my boyfriend, i broke off with him on the spot. Apparently they had been dating for a year at the time. I blocked his number and haven't known from him ever since. \n\nBack to the dinner. I tried to change waitresses because I knew it was probably a awkward situation for the both of us, but the place was too crowded and it wasn't possible. She served me harshly and would roll her eyes when I ask her something. That I could handle but then she \"joked\" to my date to be careful of me because I \"like to jump on people's boyfriend's dick\". That was super inappropriate, my date and I both complained about her to management, they said sorry for her behavior and made her paid for our dinner. We finished and our bill came, it was nearly 1 million won. We of course didn't pay because the manager told us it was on the house for the way his waitress treated us so we left. \n\nHonestly I feel kinda of bad for this girl because our bill was a lot of money, probably half of what she makes there (although I'm not sure about that). Everyone tells me that I didn't do anything bad and that actions have consequences so she should've thought about that before disrespecting me and my date.

Nobody will learn if you make excuses for them. Yes, she sucks for making bad romantic decisions that she has to live with now.", "OP is in South Korea", "That's harsh, but if that's how things work where you are, she knew the risk she was taking by making those comments. Maybe she'll learn something.", "0h 100%, but the server wasn\u2019t being professional, and I honestly would not have eaten anything that someone brought me who was going to act like that even when her job was at stake. Nope nope nope", "Yeah you guys should have left, she probably spit in your food especially after she found out she had to pay for it.", "Reference to Epstein and Prince Andrew but I deleted it.", "She's obviously a sugar baby \ud83d\ude02", "He's obviously wealthy enough to afford an $800 meal, so there's that.", "I just highly doubt she has any reliable family or friends in the picture. There\u2019s no way anyone who loved her would let that happen", "They want you to stop dating men over a decade older then you.", "That's not an okay age gap, given your respective ages. You're 19, so I understand how you wouldn't realize this...but any man in his thirties who would actively pursue a woman who's barely out of high school isn't a well-adjusted person. Please wait a few years before accepting dates with guys who graduated from college a decade ago.", "Not attending therapy to discuss why you're seeking out relationships with such older men.", "Dating men that could be your father lol", "Stop dating old men. They don\u2019t love you, they\u2019re taking advantage of you", "She\u2019s 19, she\u2019s dating a 32 year old. She\u2019s got drama. How many brain cells are we actually talking about here?", "Are you looking for a boyfriend or a replacement for your absent father figure?", "Why specifically does the OP suck?", "A 32 year old man should have nothing in common with a 19 year old woman.", "But how does it make OP TA? It's the men who are preying on these girls.", "I don't like the age gap either and I'm positive that there's manipulation going on. Whether or not she's TA isn't related to anyone's age in this scenario.", "Lmao, she should stop dating guys that much older. That\u2019s how she sucks. She also could of handled the situation by leaving once there was no chance of getting a new waitress.", "Maybe she spit in OPs food. If she\u2019s going to make rude comments on the job why wouldn\u2019t she spit in the food after finding out she\u2019s the one who has to pay for it?", "Good point. Never eat food brought to you by someone who hates you. I didn't even think of that. Scary.", "Servers don't spit in people's food. They just don't.", "tbh that is a red flag", "Heck she may not even be out of HS yet.", "That or she's just looking for a sugar daddy. Either way yeah...needs to stop", "Not quite.", "I don't believe for a second that she had nothing to do with the other woman being angry at her, that she didn't know. If that woman is still so resentful, she certainly did something to warrant this waitress risking her payment or tip.", "I didn\u2019t say she was. ESH means everyone sucks here. Because they do. They all suck in this situation.", "She should of left when there was no chance of a new waitress. Would you eat somewhere where you had issues with the waitress? Personally, I don\u2019t like spit or who knows what other mystery flavoring in my food. The waitress also sucks for continuing the drama.", "You literally said above that these older guys are preying on her, but are now saying she sucks for dating them. Which is it?", "but age has nothing to do with this", "And look back that before this, possibly a year or more ago, she was dating a 27 year old. This is a pattern.", "OK, I'll rephrase. How does she suck in this situation?", "I can\u2019t believe people are upvoting your moronic statements. We do not blame teens for grown ass men taking advantage of them. And the fact you do is gross", "Yeah, I hadn't thought of the food tampering until someone else mentioned it. Considering what the waitress was willing to say to the date while working, she's probably capable of more shady stuff.", "They suck for preying on her. She sucks for continuously going after older men. Yes, both things can happen!! She sucks for not leaving when she couldn\u2019t switch waitresses. The waitress sucks for the drama. You can stop yourself from being preyed on by not going out or associating with men like that or are that much older when you\u2019re 19.", "I didn\u2019t blame her solely for that now did I? Reading comprehension isn\u2019t your strong suit clearly. Incase you need help reading, I said it\u2019s disgusting they are dating her. I said she sucks for being connected to them and not leaving the restaurant when they couldn\u2019t switch waitresses. You want a waitress whom hates you to have access to your food? Looks like the only moron is you.", "If the age difference creates an imbalance of power that makes his behavior predatory or exploitative, then she is a victim.\n\nIf there is NOT such an imbalance of power that she is culpable for choosing to get involved with him, then they're both adults and can date whoever they want.", "Just because they *can* doesn\u2019t mean a 19 year and 32 *should* date.", "But it doesn't automatically make them an AH if they do.\n\nThe ages really have nothing to do with the conflict here."]}
