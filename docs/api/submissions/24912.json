I\u2019m not a perfect husband but I\u2019m trying.\n\nI am very self-conscious about my mechanical ability. My wife knows this. I\u2019ve come a long way but I still have confidence issues and I get extremely flustered when a project is not going well. \n\nThe other day I changed the front brakes on my truck. It went very smooth and I felt great about it. Then I realized my rear brakes also needed to be done in addition to a new caliper.  Rear brakes (especially the rotors) are a completely different beast. My wife said, \u201cThat should be done by a professional with better tools.\u201d I told her I\u2019m trying to save money and also I\u2019m confident that I can do it myself. I just need to do some research.\n\nTonight after watching several videos I found out what I needed to do. It took me a while but I finally got the rotor off and replaced. When I tried putting the new caliper on (totally different style) I struggled to get the brake pads on. That was supposed to be the EASY part! I quickly became frustrated, started swearing at myself, \u201cCome on you fucking idiot\u2026how are you struggling with this part?\u2026. I can\u2019t fucking believe this\u2026I\u2019m such a fucking dumbass\u2026\u201d Along with lots more cursing. My wife was outside smoking and witnessing all of this. It got dark and I finally realized that I had to stop and just admit defeat. Now my truck is sitting on jacks and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I started putting tools away.\n\nShe asked if I was done. I was visibly upset and told her I can\u2019t finish and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not going together. Her response, in a very condescending tone, \u201cThat\u2019s why I said it should be done by PROFESSIONALS. But you don\u2019t fucking listen to me.\u201d I told her that was the last thing I needed to hear right now and that I\u2019m about to have a breakdown. Her response, \u201cI\u2019ll just go fuck myself then.\u201d\n\nI tried telling her that in my dark moment of failure she was basically telling me \u201ctold you so\u201d.  Her response, \u201cYeah, I never FUCKING said that. So you just think I\u2019m an asshole then.\u201d I told her that it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to listen to her\u2026it was that I researched, got great advice from co-workers, I felt confident about it my work for once, and that it was actually going good up until the brake pads which I didn\u2019t expect to kick my ass. It went on from there, me telling her I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole, I was just upset about the brakes and I even APOLOGIZED for taking it out on her (just trying to de-escalate the situation). She wouldn\u2019t budge so I just walked away.

You ignored your wife and put your car and finances (which since you're married means your wife's finances as well) at risk because of your ego.\n\n2.  You went and threw a huge tantrum when the inevitable happened.  Very few things are worse than having to be around someone who walks straight into trouble and then loses their shit when it inevitably bites them in the ass.\n\n3.  You then doubled down and got worse.\n\nDo you think you're a pleasant person to live with?  Do you think someone who makes stupid decisions, ignores good advice, makes things worse, and throws tantrums is what people look for in a life partner?", "YTA mechanical skills doesn't lie in the manhood it's not something to be insecure about, know your limits and accept them.

That\u2019s like if I, a casual amateur tennis player, challenged Serena Williams to a match and got pissy when someone suggested I was probably gonna lose. Either get professional experience or admit you\u2019re not a professional. Stop wasting time and your wife\u2019s emotional energy. If I were her I would be so, so tired of this.\n\nLike\u2026my husband occasionally attempts and fails at home repairs, usually after I told him we should just pay someone. He laughs and says \u2018yup you were right\u2019, because he\u2019s not self conscious about not being a plumber.", "YTA you don\u2019t have the skills(and prob not the tools either), stop being toxic and let someone with the skills and proper tools handle it. \n\nShe told you so and she was right - professionals needed to handle it.

Not everyone is good at everything and that's ok.

Even I know front brakes you can do, and rear brakes are generally for professionals. Are you a professional? No. And the caliper too?!?

That\u2019s gonna cost more than if you had gone to the mechanic in the first place. There\u2019s a time and a place for learning new skills. Replacing back brakes is not one of them. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014no one likes to be told that they were wrong. But\u2026you were very wrong and handled it super poorly. Let her cool down and apologize tomorrow for not listening to her. Imagine how it feels for her that you don\u2019t respect her opinion. That instead of you taking what she said into consideration before making a decision, you got offended and decided to do the opposite basically out of spite and sensitivity.", " ESH \n\nIt is extremely frustrating to live with someone who is setting themselves up for failure and then becoming moody when they fail. It is ok to feel feelings, but if you're not handling your feelings well, they negatively affect those around you, and from your post, this seems to be the case. Your wife knew there was a high risk of you failing and not being able to handle the disappointment and she seems to be sick and tired of having to deal with your bad mood that in her eyes was 100% avoidable. \n\nOn the other hand, although understanding why she kind of lost it, I don't think her approach was very nice nor actually helpful for either her or you.\n\nWhat you both need is better communication about what actually triggers her when it comes to your mechanical projects (my money it is on how they affect your temper and thus also affecting her) and you need to come up with better strategies on how to deal with your temper when things aren't going well. Shit talking yourself will only wind you up, getting you in a worse and worse mood until you rage quit and then being mad for the rest of the day. I also think that part of her frustration is because she misses you. If you spend a day on a project maybe she hopes to spend time with you afterwards only to have that hope crushed when the project leaves you in a bad mood. And if this is the case she needs to learn to communicate her wishes and expectations of the day better\n\nTry to find what works better for you. Before you start a project, think about how you will feel and plan on how you will deal with those feelings if you fail. Maybe plan a break if things start to go south. Maybe involve your wife in a positive manner by saying \" hey, it's not going well but I don't wanna spiral and end up in a bad mood so I'll go for  a walk/ have a coffe/ go to the gym (whatever makes for a good break for you) would you care to join me?\" That way, you are showing her you are being proactive while also inviting her to some quality time for the two of you.", "YTA, but probably not for the other reasons people have suggested. Where I live you don't just do engine work on your car yourself without getting it checked by a professional. If you screw up you are endangering not just yourself, but other road users.\n\nThe only things I'd do ok my own car are change bulbs, fluids and potentially the battery as it's a lift out and slot in job. Even then I'd check with a mechanic about the battery or wait for MOT and service time (if you have those where you are).\n\nYou have no experience, you just decided to do it as some sort of weird masculinity test and with that attitude you would likely just be pleased stuff went back together and that seems like it would eclipse your objective view to check it was 100% right and safe.\n\nI think with such an insecure attitude you are way more likely to put other road  users at risk.\n\nMay I suggest that you go on a course if it is that important to you? At least stop getting so worked up that you display frightening behaviour like your tantrum and have the good grace to admit defeat. Call someone to come fix it and watch them.", "YTA\u2026 OP, I\u2019m going to be very honest with you, if I was in your wife\u2019s position (which I am not, admittedly) I wouldn\u2019t put up with this shit. Your wife told you what was going to happen in a way that shows that you do this regularly, that this is a pattern by now. No amount of swearing at yourself and breaking bits of your truck and sobbing in the shower is going to fix your emotional state about \u201cbeing a mechanic\u201d, which is why all this frustration, for both of you, is happening. I think you should talk to a therapist to solve this conflict at the core.", "YTA. She said \u201cI told you so\u201d because she knew how the situation would play out. You said so yourself that you\u2019re self conscious about your abilities - so her taking that into account and thinking of your own well being, she suggested something VERY PLAUSIBLE - you just got your panties in a wad and decided \u201cme man. me fix car!\u201d then got mad when you couldn\u2019t. If you\u2019re doubting your own ability, especially with a high maintenance project like rear breaks, I\u2019d listen to the wife from now on.", "INFO- How old are you, 12?", "OP, the biggest issue here is not who is the AH.   The most important issue here is that you need help dealing with your emotional and mental health.  It\u2019s not healthy to talk to oneself in that way (whether out loud or in your head).  Your life could be so much better if you learn how to regulate your self talk and by extension, your emotions.   No judgment\u2014lots of us have this tendency.   But man, daily life is so much better when you learn to stop this behavior.  Best wishes!", "YTA you need therapy if doing some work on your car gets you this angry. You were about to have a breakdown because you, not a mechanic, couldn\u2019t fix your car. That is not an appropriate reaction.", "..that is a lot of words to say: \" I'm an asshole\"", "YTA. You can\u2019t even control your own behaviour but you expect her to show endless love and patience. \n\nI\u2019ve been in relationships with people like you; people who throw tantrums and swear and get aggressive when things don\u2019t go their way and it\u2019s fucking awful. Get your shit together. \n\nYou tried something, it didn\u2019t work.. big fucking deal. \n\nYou felt shitty about yourself and instead of just admitting that you were in out of your depth, you\u2019re projecting all your anger onto your wife. \n\nShe\u2019s right: you should have gotten a professional to do it, or at the very least, when you fucked it up you should have acted like a grown up.. admitted your mistake, had a laugh about it and then called a professional to do the job properly. \n\nDon\u2019t behave in a way that is alienating, threatening and over the top and then expect everyone else to stroke your ego better.", "YTA\n\nCertain services will exponentially be more expensive when performed by experts because you are paying them for their years of experience and knowledge.\n\nAn amateur\u2019s DIY approach on something as important as brakes is more likely to endanger your life and others on the road. \n\nYour wife certainly doesn\u2019t get paid enough to deal with you.", "I'm sorry, are you the only one in the relationship aloud to have confidence in themselves? She told you the right thing to do and you completely dismissed her. Does she need to hide gher ego just in order to let yours get out of control, to the point you can't even admit fault?\n\nYou're being a text book of fragile masculanity.", "So you\u2019re an idiot, gotcha. And YTA", "YTA and an idiot. It\u2019s the breaks. One of the most important safety parts of a car. If you\u2019re not exactly sure what you\u2019re doing take it to a professional.

As someone with a husband who insists on doing things himself that should be done by a professional and usually ends up costing us more money fixing whatever he screwed up than we would\u2019ve spent had he just hired someone to begin with, I can see your wife\u2019s frustration. Especially if you\u2019re struggling to the point where you\u2019re swearing at yourself and in a super shitty mood because you can\u2019t figure it out. No one wants to be around someone acting like that. \n\nOn the other hand, she should\u2019ve let it go when you apologized. She made a snarky comment, you reacted, then she made it into a huge thing unnecessarily. But given how many times I\u2019ve watched my husband do the same thing and bit my tongue, I can\u2019t give her the AH on this one.", "I'm going to get downvoted here, but ESH.\n\nI am a professional mechanic that wasn't born doing it. In fact, nobody is born a mechanic and you spend your entire life learning. Some days, you feel like you can conquer the world and rebuild every engine, others, you just want to quietly put your tools away and go bury your head in the sand somewhere.\n\nYou're just learning how to work on your own stuff, it can be difficult and sometimes stressful. You'll worry you can't do it or you won't be able to get things back together. What you need here, is more patience and less of a sniveling , whiny attitude. You immediately blamed your wife for having no faith in you, when really, you didn't have any faith in your ability to problem solve and it scared you. In moments like those, you gotta own up to your own shortcomings and buy a service manual, watch a couple more videos, and think your way through the problem. DO NOT BLAME OTHERS FOR THIS. it's literally a part of learning a new skill, a new skill that many other people have spent entire lifetimes studying. It's not a simple skill you'll pick up in a weekend. \n\n\nWith that being said, your wife is being harsh. Really harsh. She is probably just as intimidated as you are at this new undertaking that you're interested in. If you mess up brakes, you could kill someone. She knows that, but she's focusing more on that than she is the fact that you're becoming resourceful and learning something new. Changing brakes is easy and EVERYONE should be able to do that along with change their own oil. Eventually, you're new. Stop being so hard on yourself and stop taking it out on your wife.\n\n\nAnyways, I hope you read this. Please continue to pursue your new hobby. Mechanicin' ain't easy, as my dad always said, or everyone would be doing it. It literally takes a lifetime of study. No matter how long you do it, there will always be a situation or problem that pops up that you'll say, 'Well, damn, I've never seen that before.' And that's okay, because someone else has, but now we have the vastness of the internet at our fingertips and you just need to look through enough forums to find the solution.", "YTA - you're genuienly offended over your wife being right? It's not her fault you wouldn't listen and failed....", "\u201eDark moment of failure\u201c \n\nLOL.\n\nJust admit that your skills are not quite where they need to be for certain things. \n\nYTA just for being a bit a bit dramatic over it all", "I\u2019ll get downvoted for this but NTA, and here\u2019s why. \n\nYou admit you\u2019re not mechanically inclined. But it\u2019s clearly a skill you want to become good at. And that takes practice. \n\nYou did the front ones, and it worked. So onto the back ones. They are typically a different beast but you watched the videos, did the research and tried. Then you got frustrated and started swearing (I want one person who hasn\u2019t done that to step forward\u2026 I\u2019ll wait\u2026). Being hard on yourself isn\u2019t cool but we\u2019ve all been there. \n\nThis was after a long day of working on the car. Stopping for the night and resuming in the morning is a smart move. Is this the only vehicle you guys have? Is there somewhere either of you need to be tomorrow? If yes then maybe better timing on your part could have been added. \n\nBut tomorrow you\u2019ll tackle it again. And you\u2019ll either be successful or you won\u2019t. Learning a new skill takes time and a lot of people responding here are super willing to just let someone else do it for them. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand the people saying \u201cyou put the finances in jeopardy\u201d because you didn\u2019t????? Either way you\u2019d have spent the money on parts. Attempting it yourself would have saved labor costs. Having to bring it to someone, with parts already purchased means you\u2019re just paying them labor costs.. which you would have paid anyways had you not attempted it yourself. Likely you\u2019ll have to pay like what, $90 for a tow? \n\nAlso, your wife 100% said \u201cI told you so\u201d. Not in those exact words but \u201cthat\u2019s why I said\u2026\u201d is the same thing. She also witnessed you get frustrated and swearing. I told you so comments are the worst way to de-escalate a situation and will make things worse. You shouldn\u2019t have yelled back though. I understand being frustrated and someone just piling on but matching their tone never helps. \n\nKeep trying my man. Learning a new skill takes time. Good luck!!", "Both of you are assholes so ESH. There is nothing wrong with wanting to learn how to maintain your own car. Her response had a form of smugness to it. Unless you guys had an argument prior you should not have taken your frustration of not completing the job on her and she should have but phrased it in a way that was basically a \"I told you so.\"\n\nI'm not sure what your guys' relationship is so from this instance of her saying you don't listen to me and you lashing out makes my vote", "YTA.

Any idiot can do it.  \nSource - I'm an idiot that's actually done it.", "ESH\n\nFor your part, you aren't an AH for not being able to do this. The problem is letting it get to you. Your wife presumably has to deal with this on a regular basis, and let me tell you, being around someone who sets themselves up for failure \\*and then takes it out on themselves\\* is exhausting. \n\nIt's okay to try to figure it out, especially if this is a skill you are trying to improve. But if you are going to turn yourself into a beacon of stress, that's going to be frustrating to your partner who (in their mind) sees an easy and simple way to solve it that you turned down. \n\nThat said, you aren't intentionally trying to cause her stress, and coming at you in your lowest moment is just making things worse. It's okay for her to have a talk with you after the fact about your tendency to take on projects that might be beyond you, and how you then react when it gets out of hand.

A more supportive person  would comfort you, but your wife went the tough love way and that's fine too. She's right that a professional would have handled it better, but I also recognise that you want to save money and like to DIY which is deserving of praise, because many would simply choose the easier route. Anyway firstly you don't have to feel bad, you are inexperienced! Get a professional, and ask him to teach you how to resolve.

My wife knows this. I\u2019ve come a long way but I still have confidence issues and I get extremely flustered when a project is not going well. \n\nThe other day I changed the front brakes on my truck. It went very smooth and I felt great about it. Then I realized my rear brakes also needed to be done in addition to a new caliper.  Rear brakes (especially the rotors) are a completely different beast. My wife said, \u201cThat should be done by a professional with better tools.\u201d I told her I\u2019m trying to save money and also I\u2019m confident that I can do it myself. I just need to do some research.\n\nTonight after watching several videos I found out what I needed to do. It took me a while but I finally got the rotor off and replaced. When I tried putting the new caliper on (totally different style) I struggled to get the brake pads on. That was supposed to be the EASY part! I quickly became frustrated, started swearing at myself, \u201cCome on you fucking idiot\u2026how are you struggling with this part?\u2026. I can\u2019t fucking believe this\u2026I\u2019m such a fucking dumbass\u2026\u201d Along with lots more cursing. My wife was outside smoking and witnessing all of this. It got dark and I finally realized that I had to stop and just admit defeat. Now my truck is sitting on jacks and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I started putting tools away.\n\nShe asked if I was done. I was visibly upset and told her I can\u2019t finish and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not going together. Her response, in a very condescending tone, \u201cThat\u2019s why I said it should be done by PROFESSIONALS. But you don\u2019t fucking listen to me.\u201d I told her that was the last thing I needed to hear right now and that I\u2019m about to have a breakdown. Her response, \u201cI\u2019ll just go fuck myself then.\u201d\n\nI tried telling her that in my dark moment of failure she was basically telling me \u201ctold you so\u201d.  Her response, \u201cYeah, I never FUCKING said that. So you just think I\u2019m an asshole then.\u201d I told her that it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to listen to her\u2026it was that I researched, got great advice from co-workers, I felt confident about it my work for once, and that it was actually going good up until the brake pads which I didn\u2019t expect to kick my ass. It went on from there, me telling her I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole, I was just upset about the brakes and I even APOLOGIZED for taking it out on her (just trying to de-escalate the situation). She wouldn\u2019t budge so I just walked away. I hopped in the shower, sobbed, and now we\u2019re not talking.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While *her* attitude wasn't helpful, the experience of seeing someone set themselves up for failure over and over and over again - not because of their skills, but because of *their attitude* - really sucks, especially if they won't take steps to change it. I suspect that's where she was coming from.\n\nI would strongly urge some kind of therapy to explore why it is that you put so much weight on a random thing (being a mechanic), are so hard on yourself when you don't live up to your own expectations, and are so unwilling to change how you approach situations like this.\n\nETA: and I saw from your other comment that she regularly belittles you like this and...yeah, that's emotionally abusive.

Even if you have to have someone complete the rear brakes, you\u2019ve learned how to do the front and saved a bunch of money on that part. Focus on the positive and not the negative! Step away when you get frustrated. Take a break and do more research on the exact model and see if there are any tricks that can make the job easier. Everyone that does their own repairs hit the same issues and frustrations (car, boat, home, whatever). \n\nFor those complaining about getting someone killed (you obviously don\u2019t know anything about brakes so how are you passing judgement when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about?). The brakes either work or they don\u2019t and if they don\u2019t, they probably just need to be bled. \n\nYour wife should have been supportive instead of passing judgement (even though she disagreed). When she learns how to do a brake job then she can pass judgement.

It definitely was an \"I told you so\", and even if it was true, it was uncalled for. What you're doing is a worthy pursuit, and can save a TON of money in the long run. Doing basic car maintenance like changing filters, oil, brakes, etc is, in my opinion, an essential skill that most people lack.

And I don't know a SINGLE troubleshooter (mechanic, IT person, contractor, etc), and i know quite a few, who DOESNT curse at themselves while they work. It kind of comes with the territory.
