I have always been skinny not for any medical reasons, I just am. While my ex on the other hand is very fit. We both met in college and we hit it off. We both started living together after graduating. She was a very nice person doing college but after moving in together she became very hostile and kept giving me the cold shoulder. One day I woke up to her smashing my car with a bat and accusing me of cheating (I never did I have always been faithful in all of my relationships) then she left and went to stay with her parents. Then her family started messaging me calling me an Ah. I apologised to her later for making her think that and she came back. But a year later I found out she cheated on me with one of her friends. So I dumped her and I just couldn't stay in my city anymore cause I was just always reminded of her so I moved 2 states away.\n\nSo now onto the problem. After 2 years of living away my parents invited me to their house for Christmas. And I was excited to go until I found out my ex was living with them. So apparently after we broke up her relationship with her AF failed and she ended up homeless for abit. But was taken in by my parents \n\nSo I told them I can't come.

If they want to see you that much, they can have you over somewhere she isn't. Like Sister and BiL's place.", "Straight up think some of these can\u2019t be real. How the fuck can anyone think they are wrong for thinking this is wild? Of course OP is NTA. Wtf, the second she blew up your car with a bat was a very clear sign you needed\nTo be gone. Fuck your parents for harboring this kind of shit. Fuck everyone, take care of yourself.", "NTA . Do they know she cheated on you?  She sounds like she's got serious projection issues and some mental illness.  Tell your family that you're sorry they picked a cheater over you, but you aren't going to humor them.", "Your parents are the asses in this situation why would they take in the girl that was emotionally abusive, destroyed property, and cheated on their son? And then assume that you would be fine with having to come be around her???? NTA and don't go back, don't put yourself through that.", "100% NTA. What possible reason is there to think you\u2019re the AH? I don\u2019t understand their behavior. My husband and I have 2 daughters, both in their 30\u2019s. One is married and the other is engaged. I like both guys. But my own kids will always come first. If your parents had given her some money to rent a room or an apartment so she wouldn\u2019t be homeless, I guess I could understand that. But to displace you from your family home by taking in your cheating ex? Absolutely goddamn not.", "NTA...it shouldn't be a mystery to them why you don't want to come. You're avoiding a drama bomb. Do whatever you please.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even know why you ask. But I have a question for you. Why did you start the post with a description of your physical attributes? I can\u2019t wrap my head around this one.", "NTA. They took in your ex, without you knowing. She trashed your car. And they took her in. WTF?", "INFO... Did you meet in college? Did she meet your parents during your relationship? How close was she with your parents? Why did your parents take her in?", "NTA - WTAF goes on in your parents' heads?  Is there something in the water?  Or maybe an alien abduction/mind wipe thing?  I can think of no rationale reason in this world why your parents would take in the ex who accused you of cheating but was in fact cheating herself and thinks taking a bat to your car is the way to address her issues.  I think you are perfectly justified in refusing to have anything to do with any of these people because what they are doing is just seriously jacked up.", "NTA. That\u2019s cold-hearted that they sided with an ex that cheated on you, destroyed your property, and has treated you horribly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents are major though tbh. They hid that from you cause they knew this was how they would react. And how did they think you would react when you get there and see her there?", "NTA. If they can\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t want to spend Christmas with your ex, it\u2019s their problem, not yours.", "NTA of course. What was your parent\u2019s reasoning for choosing this ex over you?", "NTA. If they consider you an AH, why do they want you around?", "No NTA. Its an asshole move to be upset at your kid for  not wanting to be around the cheating ex on their holiday break. That's not anyone's idea of a good time.", "What did you apologize to her for? You said you apologized for \u201cmaking her think that\u201d.  Think what?", "NTA. Do your parents know about what went on in your relationship?", "NTA. uh\u2026. why are your parents harboring your ex? sus. But also like, do they not understand how awkward of a Christmas that would be?? WTF", "NTA, obviously. But for real, what is it with all these parents that have their kids\u2019 exes living with them? This is like the third or fourth time I\u2019ve seen a post like this and it\u2019s mind-boggling.", "Why is the supposed hostile ex living with YOUR parents??? Am I reading that right? I am assuming the parents are aware of y\u2019all\u2019s relationship history, and they still let her live there? So much for loyalty to your own kid? Definitely NTA.", "Definitely not an she gaslighted everyone to believe your the bad guy, find people to spend Christmas with who love snd respect you.", "Did you tell them you 'can't come' or did you ever mention that your ex had an affair and took a baseball bat to your car? Do you expect she has told them that?\n\nI'd point out these facts to them in your explanation of why you will not be returning to their home so long as this woman -- who has been abusive and destructive to you --  is living with them.\n\nNTA", "Because when ever she would get physical with me and hurt me I basically had no way of protecting myself and it kinda got to my head and I felt helpless. That's why I took her back in after the car incident", "Yes\nYes\nThey really liked her and treated her like apart of the family. Cause they felt bad for her after she became homeless", "Oh man I\u2019m sorry. She was awful and abusive. Did you ever ask your parents why they took her in after all she did to you? Are they also terrible?", "Damn to choose her over you. That's just wrong", "NTA. Your family is TOXIC. Stay away from them.", "NTA NTA AND again NTA\n\nShe is a grown ass woman who is not their responsibility. \n\nWhat is wrong with them entertaining her in their home.", "NTA NTA NTA", "Nta think about nc until your ex leaves"]}
