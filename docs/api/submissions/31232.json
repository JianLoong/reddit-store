Along with that we care and provide for her daughter. \n\nNila goes to school a few hours away, and our nephew was visiting this area and seen her at a local club, as a pole girl. She asked him not to tell us, but he did so anyways. I confronted her and she tried to deny it, but then admitted she\u2019s been doing this for the past few months. I asked her why, and basically short answer is she\u2019s not responsible with the money we\u2019re giving her, and shopping is more important. I then threatened to cut her off financially, because for one I don\u2019t approve of my only daughter doing this kind of work, and two, she\u2019s making money of her own and isn\u2019t being responsible with ours, 3 hiding it from us and not sending any back to help with Kimberly in anyway.\n\nShe began to cry and begged me not too, she said it wasn\u2019t fair that was she an adult and could do as she pleases but still needs help.

If she is, and is passing her courses, then you have to decide what\u2019s more important to you.  Her finishing school or her adhering to only what you approve of.  It\u2019s entirely possible that the money you send is being used for school and she works for extra money for fun stuff.  Your post blows right past any real details about what she\u2019s spending the money on.  \n\nAnd while she is right in that she is an adult and can do as she pleases, you\u2019re not required to fund her voyage of self discovery.  It\u2019s ok for your continued financial support to come with certain conditions.  But think long and hard about the lines you draw in the sand.  They may come with unintended consequences.\n\nNot giving a judgement as it depends on whether or not she\u2019s dropped out of school.  If she has, then she\u2019s dumped her child on you to raise and expects you to continue to fund her life.  And that\u2019s not ok.

If she keeps going to college that \"pole girl\" income will be necessary now, rather than a way to create shopping money.\n\nIf you have any way to get though to her and get her to use your money for what it's meant for and concentrate on her studies, it would obviously be better than her getting further  involved in an industry that might involve things, or lead to things, she would later regret.\n\nLay aside your anger and see if there is some way you can get her back on track. You may not be able to if she is lured by easy money, but at least you would have tried.\n\nI don't envy you, as you have to walk a line between not enabling her to go further off course and not driving her to seek even worse ways of getting \"easy\" money (that come with consequences she might not be able to even see right now).", "You give her money for tuition and car insurance.

That said, you have plenty to be concerned about here.  You had a 15 year old daughter who became a mother and likely never finished maturing as you and your wife have picked up her responsibilities.  How is it you felt it was okay for her to leave her child behind while she headed off the college?  She's a mother and mothers should be with their babies.   Even without the child, 19 is hardly grown up, but usually grown up enough to understand honesty and appreciation for what her parents have and are doing for her.  It's already clear she's not responsible for her child, understandably since what 15 year old is ready for motherhood?  This is a lot for you and her to handle, I'm afraid, but it is reality and must be handled.\n\nSo, she hasn't learned to manage money.  Hopefully, that is her only issue.  Frankly, I'd be concerned if she is in a pole dancing environment that she is not dabbling or hooked on drugs or alcohol abuse.  What do you really know of how she is living now?  Is she even for certain still in school?\n\nYou're not wrong in wanting to begin to back away from completely supporting her if she is not using good judgment and spending your money given to her for specific uses.  Not sure what that will mean though as it's not like she has a great career job.  \n\nAm wondering if you've ever had this girl in counseling, and maybe you and your wife too.  Sounds to me like you all might benefit from that.  A grandchild you are now caring for and a daughter who is off pole dancing says that this train is off the tracks and needs some help getting back on.  Please don't be afraid to ask for that help in hopes your daughter's and granddaughter's futures will be bright and healthy.", "NTA but set expectations for her in future, have her be more responsible for her child, she needs to learn consequences but not at the expense of ruining her sense of support or We are humans and make mistakes at any age, guide her I feel you both can learn from this situation. She could be spending time raising her child versus pole dancing but that\u2019s on you. Also don\u2019t expect perfection from anyone, we aren\u2019t perfect parents they won\u2019t be perfect children. Sit her down and meet in the middle for a solution, other than school I think she needs more responsibility as a mother regardless if she\u2019s in college. Hope this helps", "You say she cried and begged not to be cut off but also said she is an adult and can do what she wants... maybe it's time for a dose of being an adult responsible for raising a 4 year old.

You choose what you want to do with it. You're helping her A LOT for her being 19.

You gave her that money to spend on herself. Sex work shouldn't be frowned upon in my opinion, but to each their own.

But it comes at such a cost, the drugs, the resentment of men, the loss of self respect and to temptations to go further. \n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t be supporting that career choice and if she pursues it I\u2019d be going as far as pushing for custody of the child unless she plans on taking her daughter full time.", "Since she wants to claim to being an adult and she can do what she wants then maybe she should start taking care of her biggest responsibility which is her child NTA", "NTA", "NTA she is 19 years old.

Pay tuition, drop the car and insurance payments, reduce the amount of free-range fun money she's provided. She'll have to get a job - tho technically it sounds like she has one, and stripping can pay well - and learn to budget. \n\nYou can help her with the budgeting; it's good practice for later. She has to get used to not being able to afford everything. Life is different when someone else is not funding your entire life.\n\nThen when she graduates, give her a timetable for landing a job.

It\u2019s good money, half the girls are putting themselves through college, and if you stay away from the girls doing drugs it can be great money. \n\nWhat the job is doesn\u2019t matter to me. The issue is that you were funding her SCHOOLING and LIVING EXPENSES, not her fun budget. Now normally, I\u2019d say getting a job to provide her own fun money is a good thing, but there\u2019s two key points:\n\n1. She is meant to be a full time student, and you\u2019re funding her so that she can dedicate herself to her studies.\n2. She has a child; she has several more important things to pay for before she gets to fun spending, and she\u2019s not doing so. Additionally, more of her fun spending should go to fun things for her child. \n\nI would discuss that the money and childcare you\u2019re providing is exclusively so she can attend school as a full time student. If she doesn\u2019t want to be a full time student, that\u2019s her right; in that case, she won\u2019t receive the same benefit. Whether that is entirely cut off, significantly reduced stipend, no stipend and only care for the kiddo, etc, is up to you.\n\nAnother route is to only pay for bills directly, so she can\u2019t use your funding for shopping. I had a friend in college who was very irresponsible with money who had this setup. Her parents paid her rent and utilities directly, paid phone bill directly, and gave her a gift card to the grocery store (these days you can also gift Instacart orders, so you could have a standing grocery delivery set up for her). \n\nThey also required she send a transcript of her grades every quarter to make sure she was focusing on school - this was the only part she was resentful of, as she was pursing a very hard major and sometimes it\u2019s just not possible to get A\u2019s in calculus, astrophysics, and aero engineering all at once. \n\nYou know your daughter.

And try to guide her remotely by frequently calling and helping her find a decent job.\n\nChildren need guidance from parents to find their way in life. Provide your daughter with some guidance. Help her find decent employment, instead of abandoning her, leaving your child all on her own, in an unknown city. That's cold. She's an adult, yes. But she's only 19, and hasn't lived on her own before. Has she even had a normal job as a teenager to begin with, while living with you, before she went off to college? Does she know how to find employment?

Because obviously you're not good at teaching your kid responsibility, if she's a teen Mum who got into debt despite having her college paid for with an allowance.\n\nAlso why is your nephew at strip clubs? The little creep. ESH", "YTA", "YTA. To at least some extent, your daughter is what you and your wife have made her. Let me try to put it into perspective for you, from your daughter's point of view.\n\n\"Sweetheart, we'll take care of you and give you everything you could ever need or want. You don't have to learn any responsibility, and if you become a teen mother we'll relieve you of the burden of raising the child so you can focus on what you want to do, whether it's school, a job, or whatever. Just don't disappoint us by becoming a stripper.\"\n\nWhere were you when she was little and should've been learning personal responsibility, empathy for others, and a conscience?

You and your wife made some huge missteps along the way toward turning her into a responsible adult.\n\nParenthood is not a matter of bringing a child into the world for their own benefit or as a favor to them; we must first teach our children how to belong to and fit into the family dynamic, then we must prepare them for the societal dynamic.\n\nThe home is meant to be a microcosm of society. We teach our children the rules of the home and enforce those rules through a system of both punishments and rewards, which in turn prepares them for the rules/laws of society so they can be prepared to accept society's system of punishments and rewards.\n\nShe's right, she's an adult who can do as she pleases. She's also right that she still needs help, but that's your fault not hers. Also, you need to think about the welfare of your granddaughter. If you cut your daughter off completely, what's going to become of her child? The most likely scenario is that your daughter will have to quit school and work full time to support her daughter, or she'll have to go on welfare. And if you and your wife try to take the child away from your daughter, you'll end up irreparably damaging your relationship with her. Will all of that really be worth it?", "Soft ESH - Your daughter has been incredibly reckless and is clearly a selfish person who cares little for the people around her. But she\u2019s also clearly a mess and if she is already working in a strip club, it\u2019s quite possible her life will completely fall apart if you remove the support you are currently providing her with.

My wife and I did pretty well for ourselves so we\u2019ve been financially supporting her and caring for her child(4) since she\u2019s been in a university. While she\u2019s away at college, we helped pay for her tuition, we pay for her car insurance, and give her a decent amount of money every month to focus on her studies stress free, while she is away. Along with that we care and provide for her daughter. \n\nNila goes to school a few hours away, and our nephew was visiting this area and seen her at a local club, as a pole girl. She asked him not to tell us, but he did so anyways. I confronted her and she tried to deny it, but then admitted she\u2019s been doing this for the past few months. I asked her why, and basically short answer is she\u2019s not responsible with the money we\u2019re giving her, and shopping is more important. I then threatened to cut her off financially, because for one I don\u2019t approve of my only daughter doing this kind of work, and two, she\u2019s making money of her own and isn\u2019t being responsible with ours, 3 hiding it from us and not sending any back to help with Kimberly in anyway.\n\nShe began to cry and begged me not too, she said it wasn\u2019t fair that was she an adult and could do as she pleases but still needs help.

Nothing wrong with having that mentality of independence, but from a parent perspective it seems ludicrous to encourage this behavior. \n\nI\u2019d recommend being more relaxed and not cutting her off financially.

Or Are you upset *because* the job is exotic dancing? \n\nIs your daughter still going to school and providing adequate care for her daughter? Or is she lying about what she does with your money in order to avoid those responsibilities, but still have the help coming in?\n\nI think going into this conversation and any monetary shifts, you need to assume that the job she has is *any* job, and remove the stigma from it, in order to have a conversation about the actuality of her finances, what she needs, and what you are willing to support. The nature of the job itself needs to be removed from this conversation in order to make any headway.\n\nI think one thing  that sticks out from this conversation, for me, is the fact that your male relative went to a strip club, where he is paying other women to show their bodies, but still felt it was appropriate to tattle on her to you. I highly doubt he was worried about your finances, and was likely subscribing to a huge double standard- the one where men feel comfortable objectifying women for money, as long as it\u2019s someone else\u2019s relative, and not their own.\n\nSex work can be dangerous, and that\u2019s an aspect of it that, if it was coming from a place of legitimate concern, that doesn\u2019t really enter the financial support chat.\n\nSort that out for yourself, with your wife, and then address it with the intention of getting your daughter what she needs, without paying for her to avoid responsibility.\n\nThen you can address the safety concern.", "Did you teach her to be responsible with money?

If you raised her by giving her everything she wanted and by her having no responsibility for anything at all, it's going to be a rough road.\n\n\nCutting her off totally is going to make the situation much worse.

Helping is something you should do, but threatening to stop helping your adult daughter because of the way she is earning extra money is trash.

You can be upset all you want about her personal source of income, but you don't have the right to tell her she can't. If you want to reduce the amount you're giving her, that's fine, and I can understand that, much like your wife said.

Ok got it", "ESH but you less than Nila and your wife.\n\nNila has responsiblities that come with having a child but she was a child when Kimberly was born.  I understand you wanting Nila to be successful and go to a good college but it sounds as though you have taken over Kimberly's care and let Nila off the hook and you're funding everything.  The better path at that time may have been to support her caring for her daughter and teaching her how to parent and encouraging her to support her own daughter.  She could go to a local college and possibly gain the same qualification or it will just take her longer to reach her goals if she needs extra steps.  That is a consequence of having a child that early.\n\nI'm not going to blame you for Nila getting pregnant as I know these things happen even to the best parents.  That's a good reason to look at longer term contraceptives for even the younger teen (it only takes once to possibly get pregnant) no matter how religious you might be.\n\nNila doesn't sound like she's learnt much about life.  She clearly doesn't know anything about budgeting.  You can't control what she does to earn money.  And she's probably making good money pole dancing so she's not going to want to give that up just yet.\n\nHer living away from her child for months on end isn't encouraging her to be a mother.  Nila is also going to be away for at least 3 years at college and then she may get a job in that area and by then Kimberly is going to be at school and Nila won't have before and afterschool care and doesn't want to disrupt where she is etc.... so you will probably be responsible for Kimberly till she grows up.\n\nYou are not wrong in cutting off the finances.

Or is it that she is being irresponsible?   \n\n\nSo, who taught her to be this way? If she's 18 now, you and your wife had some input, at least until recently, right?

Up until this secret was revealed it sound like you were helping Nila work towards getting her degree despite being a single teen mother. That is a major help for her and for your granddaughter's future. Cutting them off cuts out that possible future for them. So, again deep breaths, and time to think about where the real problems lie: budgeting and spending beyond her means. She not only needs to live within her student means, but also set aside money for emergencies and future goals.
