Also whoever brings a baby to a cinema is inherently an AH, no matter the movie", "NTA.  No one wants to be watching a movie at a theatre and have a baby screaming and crying.", "NTA - leave the infant with a sitter. Some parents need to realize their children aren\u2019t welcome everywhere.", "NTA. Your mom is a human and she can be wrong too, and she is wrong. Im glad there is a policy in place. The fact that mommy and daddy couldn\u2019t find a sitter in a timely manner is not the cinemas problem. They should of thought about that before having kids.", "NTA \n\nYou have to follow the rules on ages, it's your job. A loud cinema is cruel to a small baby. A crying baby isn't fair on everyone else there.", "NTA, and i say that as a mom who is missing going to the cinema (and other things, too). It would have been way too loud in there to bring a baby (could cause ear problems even), and with an awake baby they wouldn't have been able to watch the movie anyway.\nI completely understand their desperation, but you've done nothing wrong nonetheless.", "NTA. I would be pretty pissed as a customer if I go to the cinema to watch a movie that had a age rating of 15 and over, and a baby started crying half way. If it\u2019s a Disney movie - fine. But hell no. That couple was being incredibly self entitled.", "NTA and on behalf of movie goers everywhere thanks for your service.   A night at the movies has become so expensive and is now a rare treat for most of us--and even though I empathize with the couple wanting an evening out they are fully aware that the baby isn't going to sleep through the film and instead will be crying and disturbing the other patrons.", "NTA\n\nBabies hearing is much more sensitive than ours. You potentially helped save that baby from partial deafness. John Wick is nothing but loud, startling noises. I\u2019m sure the other people in the theatre thank you too.", "NTA\n\nIf I go to a film that is 13+ or 17+, I do NOT expect there to be young children, particularly infants, in the film. \n\nThe baby would absolutely have woken up and cried, and then all the rest of the customers would have (rightly) demanded a refund. \n\nParents should either pay for a sitter to get a night out, or watch at home.  They are NOT entitled to bother everyone else in a movie theatre.", "John Wick chapter 4? A baby?! Do they think she\u2019ll sleep thru the whole thing? Wow NTA", "I can't say NTA enough! I have been one of those patrons, but with one if the Jurassic Park movies. Once the large dinosaurs started roaring, that baby was awake and started screaming. We left and got a refund because the management didn't want to upset the parents, instead they paid more than just us because the movie was ruined by the crappy parents.", "NTA\n\nI assure you, the baby would say \"thank you\" if they could...", ">he said that it\u2019s a baby so it won\u2019t be watching and that she was asleep anyway\n\nHahahaha what? Did he forget how loud a movie in a cinema is? You didn't only keep the other cinema goers from having a meltdown, you also saved that babies sensitive eardrums.\n\nYou're NTA you're an MVP", "NTA, they are not an exception to the rules.  They sound entitled.", "NTA\n\nI'm a mom myself. Yes i love going on dates with my hubby, but: not with the kids where kids are not ok. And a cinema, whatever movie is on, is definitely *not ok* with a baby! It's super loud for them, their crying is dirsupting the movie for all other people,... You were right not to let them in.", "I'm also in the UK and around here cinemas have parent and baby screenings of recent releases, where the film is quieter and the lights are dimmed rather than off and the cinema has legal dispensation to allow underage viewers (ie babies). The couple need to find parent and baby screenings and go to them instead. NTA OP!", "NTA, if only because that's clearly the theater's policy. Your job is to enforce the policy. If management was backing you up, then they would have definitely also held you responsible if you broke the policy.\n\nAlso, I have two kids. I didn't take either to movies until they were 4 because I respected the other people in the theater. I certainly didn't take a baby into a film that would only have adults. Yeah, that meant I missed out on some movies, but I'm not going to make my kid other peoples' problem.", "NTA.  Thank you for enforcing the rules.  I largely stopped going to movie theaters due to loud/rude patrons before the pandemic and I'll never go back due to Covid, but it should be a pleasant experience for the people who weren't raised by wolves.", "NTA who the hell takes a baby to an action movie. It\u2019ll probably cry all the way through because of the noise.", "NTA\n\nThe dad sounds like an entitled nightmare", "NTA. How rude could you be to bring a baby into a movie anyway", "Nta. And I am sure that every other patron that didn't want to deal with a crying baby would thank you as well.", "NTA.\n\nWhilst it\u2019s my understanding that film age ratings don\u2019t apply to kids under 1 (when my daughter was under 1 we were able to take her to baby friendly screenings of adult theme films), there are baby friendly screenings for a reason. \n\nAt baby friendly screenings the volume is lower, lighting is different and most importantly the other cinema goers expect, and are accepting of potentially noisy or disruptive babies being there.\n\nThe parents are the assholes, mostly for not caring if they disrupt other cinema goers experience.", "NTA ... They were entitled to think it was OK to take a baby into the cinema.", "Nta. You enforced the policy of the company you worked for.  Simple as that.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "Do the parents not care for their babies hearing like, at all?", "NTA\n\nIt's the law and the companies policy so it isn't really your choice to make. Besides, you'd risk loosing your job as well as harming the babies hearing as they have sensative hearing and cinemas aren't the quietest areas. \n\nDealing with those situations and confrontational customers can be difficult but you stuck to your guns and you did the right thing", "NTA.  Nobody is required to grant exceptions to policy for any reason.", "What brainless assholes trying to bring a baby into a cinema? To John Wick, of all things?\n\nYou definitely NTA - even without the law.", "NTA. These people were being incredibly rude, selfish, and entitled. If they had brought the baby into the movie, it most likely would have disturbed the other viewers, ruining the experience they paid for. That\u2019s not even to mention the fact the baby could easily become traumatized from the loud sounds, it\u2019s wildly inappropriate for them to be exposing an infant to that level of stimulation. \n\nYour mom needs a serious reality check on basic courtesy and responsible parenting.", "NTA and your mum is an idiot.", "As someone who had a girls princess party next to me at Deadpool2 along with their parents who were taking flash photography and the 10 or so year old watching cartoons on his iPad on the other side of me while his mother kept on watching the movie... thank you.\n\nThese people are trashy.  They decided to have children, that means that the child's needs usurp theirs.  When parenthood begins, selfishness should end.\n\nNTA", "NTA, honestly I\u2019ve done my fair share of trying to get into 15s (both as a 14 year old with my parents and as a 15 year old who just didn\u2019t have ID that day) it\u2019s illegal to let someone who may or may not be 15 into that screening, a baby is very clearly not 15. I\u2019m not 100% sure what the punishment for that is, but you\u2019d definitely lose your job, maybe even get something on your record and be unable to get future jobs, probably a fine. Not to mention, there are so few child-free spaces and a 15 rated film is very clearly one of them, they were incredibly entitled to try and take a baby into an age restricted film, there are other things out too, I mean hell go to Shazam, go to Creed, 65, there are plenty of 12 rated films out right now and kids are allowed at those, they ruined their own date night.", "They were asking you to break the law. NTA", "NTA. This is why I never go to movies anymore; there are so many entitled jerks who think the rules don\u2019t apply to them and they can ruin the viewing experience of everyone around them. Movie theaters are a communal experience. Too many people don\u2019t respect that.", "NTA. Why do parents think they are entitled to bring little ones everywhere with them. Not everywhere is appropriate for small children. Also, having children sometimes means not being able to do things when you want to do them.", "NTA. Fuck people who bring a baby to an adults film", "I watched John Wick last night as soon as I saw a couple walk in with their baby, I KNEW it was gonna be a major problem! And I wasn\u2019t wrong. They lasted half the movie before they eventually got kicked out.", "Lol its not only a 15 but noone, I repeat, no one who pays to go to the cinema wants baby noises or crying during their film. \n\nNTA", "NTA - youre doing your job and covering your ass by following law. \n\nIf anyone has an issue with it they can go after the ones in charge of making the law.\n\nEdit: changed \u201cpolicy\u201d to \u201claw\u201d which makes you even more so NTA", "NTA. There is absolutely zero reason they should have brought a newborn to the cinema especially for an action film.", "No but your mother is being an asshole, expecting everyone else to be inconvenienced and put out by suggesting you force a BABY on them.", "Yhe baby if it cried and it probably would is going to ruin the movie for everyone else. Apart from the legality of this. You did ok. The young fresh parents are completely sleep deprived for the first time and mistakenly thought they knew a good idea when it was obviously a bad one.

I had similar situation years ago with a similar action film. There was a legal loop hole that theoretically allowed them to bring their less than a year old child with them (said loop hole closed since). Neither I nor my manager could persuade the parents not to do so. Surprise, surprise, the sleeping baby woke up crying, other viewers came to complain about us allowing a family with a baby to see a loud action film and we had to ask the family to leave 30mins later since they couldn't make the baby stop crying. And this all happened during the commercials and the actual film hadn't even started.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.

Even if the baby doesn't absorb the violence you are absolutely right that they would wake up and cry. Babies do not belong in theaters with violent movies made for adults.", "NTA! Personally, I think infants shouldn\u2019t be allowed in cinemas _at all_, but that\u2019s beside the point. There is a clear policy in place that you are charged with enforcing. You enforced it, and did so politely. You did nothing wrong.\n\nI can\u2019t blame the parents for being disappointed, but continuing to berate you (and your manager!) after you both explained the policy makes THEM the AHs.", "On behalf of everyone else in the theater, THANK YOU and NTA.", "NTA. Ex cinema manager here! I served a 5 year sentence and honeslty I could hear all the customers I'd had this argument with come screaming back at me.\n\nAside from the issue of it being a 15.. Cinemas are so damn loud! I'd explain that actually it's damaging for babies to be in there and that we have parent and baby friendly showings that are quieter (granted its a kids film suitable for you taking your other little kids to so they don't miss out on behalf of the baby but still) and they'd be like \"I don't care, we want to watch this film\". \n\nLike I get it, it sucks not being able to do what you want because you chose to have a baby, but omg. Be responsible. Get a sitter or something.", "NTA I have worked at a movie theatre before. There are so many entitled people who think the rules don't apply to them. Good job not bending to their guilt trip OP. I know how tempting that can be", "NTA, in Germany most cinmea forbid children under 6 because the movies are to dangerous for their little brains. Do I sometimes wish that I could just go into any movie I want? Yes. But guess what? Having a child turns your life completely upside down.

Once they get a bit older and restless, ugh.    \nI wish I'd known that with the first baby. It was only after having more and having to drag them along to non-baby places did I learn that infants are pretty portable (and often easily quietable too) when they're fresh out of the oven.

I\u2019m going to go with NAH, but I can see it being a problem. I\u2019d have told them they can bring it in but if it starts to cry they need to leave.\n\nEdited to change judgment to NAH because OP isn\u2019t an asshole, but I\u2019ve seen a baby be better behaved at a movie than many many adults who think it\u2019s ok to yell at the screen.", "YTA.

Nobody knows that the baby would\u2019ve cried. I have a two month old at home and a month ago we took her to a college basketball game. They make earmuffs for babies to help with the sound. She wasn\u2019t thrilled to be there, but she was too young to be at home and mom and I bought the season tickets before we knew about the baby. It was nice. We got to go to the final game together. \n\nLast weekend we took her to the bar to watch our team in the NCAA tournament. Again, not the happiest baby in the world, but she didn\u2019t cry at all or bother other people.

We had a few babies and newborns come into movies over the year I worked in my local cinema", "the screening we had on was not a baby screening just a regular one", "I don't know why you downvoted me when I'm literally just reporting what's on at the cinema \ud83e\udd23\n\nCinemas are licensed by the local council and the council can give exceptions where they think it's appropriate.\n\nhttps://www.bbfc.co.uk/education/university-students/legislation/film-licensing", "Lol you know it is true, they can find a parent friendly showing rather than making others suffer", "It does apply to a baby. And a loud screening could damage a 5 month old child's hearing. Sounds you don't know anything about raising a child and need to grow the fuck up.", "The law doesn't apply to babies? Ok", "She could have lost her job if she was caught letting them in. And if the baby did start to cry, no doubt someone would have reported it.", "Gross - you're one of them.", "i\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t matter whatever the fucking age is dude, https://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-classification i do actually happen to know the law regarding a huge part of my job funnily enough, stop sticking up for people dumb enough to bring a baby to a cinema for first off a 15 rated film so no person under 15 is permitted to view on commercial premises and second off extremely loud noises like action films in cinema can damage babies hearing", "U-Universal-The film is suitable for all ages.\n\nPG-Parental Guidance-The film is suitable for all ages but some scenes may upset very young children. \n\n12a-Ages 12 and up can see the film. Anyone younger must be accompanied by an adult.\n\n15-Only people aged 15 and up can buy a cinema ticket/dvd of the movie.\n\n18-Only people aged 18 and up can buy a cinema ticket/dvd of the movie.", "No. This used to be how a 12 was as well until\nIt changed into a 12A.", "No.", "No different than serving alcohol to an underage person.

They were tired parents hoping for a night out in the middle of dealing with a newborn and you ruined it. Good job.", "Thank you", "Yeah, and movies shouldn't be disrupted. It is no different than bringing a crying baby to an adult broadway show and ruining it for others. Just because you don't value the atmosphere doesn't mean no one else does.", "In the UK the law says otherwise.
