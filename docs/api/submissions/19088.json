My parents and I we constantly at a stand off (especially because they were religious and I wasn't). One night my parents woke me up and told me I was going. They brought me outside and three people I had never met before were standing at a van waiting for me. My parents decided that I needed harsher punishment and so they sent me to a Troubled Teen Wilderness camp (please look it up). Even when I was begging them not to send me they still did and I went through the worst experiences of my life. The humiliation and fear I endured is too much to go into here. After I left I counted down the days till I was 18 and didn't speak to my parents again. \n\nMy father ended up passing away a few years after I left and my mom tried reaching out. I never responded and continued to live my life. Now for what happened. Three days ago my mom tried again for the thousanth time to contact me. My husband some how convinced me to meet with her and so I did. I agreed to meet her at a public park and my husband wouldn\u2019t be too far away.  When I saw my mom I barely recognized her, her face seemed surprised to see me even though she knew I was coming. After unenthusiastic small talk I finally asked her what she wanted. She began to cry and say she wanted her little girl back, that the Lord told her I'd come back to her. Then she said that she was dying and didn't have time left but wanted me to be with her. I shortly told her I would not do that. Then she started begging. The same way I begged that night they took me. I was so full of rage and sadness I just started laughing. She looked shocked and I laughed and cried telling her I would never be her little girl again and that I hoped she died alone. After the fact my mom texted me a long paragraph, I didn't read it all but the last part was \" I never knew you were so cruel\". I do think I'm an asshole. Regardless of what happened she's the women who birthed me and I WAS a bad kid. I could have became a bad adult right? Many people in my life think I'm an asshole too. I would just like an unbiased opinion from someone.

If you want to text your mother back and lay out exactly why you\u2019re \u201cso cruel\u201d as clarification you would not be the asshole but you already aren\u2019t.

It's too bad your mom is ill, but she abandoned you to really, really horrible people. Really horrible. She has made her bed and now she will have to lie in it. Don't give her a second thought. You have emerged and are now in a good place from what your post indicates.", "NTA. The troubled teen industry is horrific. I\u2019m sorry you were mixed up in all that and the abuse you faced from your parents. I had a sister who was hugely troubled.

Emotions rolled out...laughter...irony. Your mom called you cruel and yet did not see the cruelness of her ways. It is OK to be committed to 'not go back', reflect on your behavior, and question if you were harsh that day. \n\nWhat lies ahead is what if anything do you want to do with this connection. Best to you.", "NTA. First off, I wanna say I\u2019m so sorry you had to endure that. I\u2019ve heard the horror stories and I can\u2019t imagine putting my child through that.

She sent her own baby to a prison for children to be abused and degraded. You do not owe her anything.", "NTA. You were abused and traumatized. Seeing your mom again who invoked the lord had to have stirred up a lot of horrible memories. Did you exhibit AH behavior? Sure. Is it understandable? Absolutely. I hope you can heal and move forward in a more caring way for yourself and others.", "NTA  \n\n\nBut, text her back and say what you said here. How you only lashed out at her and became cruel, because her begging reminded you of the begging you did and how horrible that camp was.  \n\n\nThen go into detail to explain how horrible it was.", "NTA. Tell her that her little girl died the night she decided to give up parenting you to someone else and ship you off to a torture facility.", "NTA. Were you a bad kid? Maybe.

OP would still have been entirely within their rights to ignore any heartfelt apology and attempt to make it up to them, but again, it\u2019s only when the abusers suddenly need \u201cforgiveness\u201d or \u201cclosure\u201d that they make any attempt.

I would have probably gone for a more neutral stance, but a few days ago I had just read about the \u2018troubled teens\u2019 school in Maine that Reddit helped shut down and if the school you were sent to was even 1/10th as bad as that, your actions/reactions was justified. Especially when your parents did not believed when you told them about what happened there and they even repeated some of the punishments again.", "NTA - I am so sorry that you had that experience. Your parents were either extremely cruel or extremely naive to send you to that camp.", "NTA. Isn't it weird how abusers manage to do the mental gymnastics required to convince themselves that they're now the victim when the person who was abused says \"enough, no more\". You are certainly NTA, and don't feel bad for protecting yourself.", "NTA\n\nThose camps were atrocious and had they listened to you then things would be different now. Actions have consequences.", "NTA, you have a right to not forgive your mother for all the hell she and your father put you to.\n\nDon't feel sympathy with abusers and the people who treated you poorly and move on and continue with your life because there is no point of keeping them in your life.", "NTA. Those camps are vile.\n\nI was not sent to a camp, but had a very religious/cult upbringing myself that would make you vomit.\n\nSetting boundaries and not accepting people back into your life is healthy and sane.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHave you connected with other wildnerness/troubled teen camps. People who haven\u2019t been there won\u2019t realize the horrific mental fucking that goes on there. Have you watched Paris Hiltons documentary on her story of being sent there? It might give you a warm blanket for a night to watch it and know some of them are being held accountable now. \n\nI did a therapeutic shroom trip (with a facilitator) and when I said I don\u2019t know if I should forgive my mom, it brought me back to the trauma and you know what, NOPE my very inner self said it was time I could let it go because it was time I knew NO I did not forgive her or any of them. WE WERE CHILDREN. (I didn\u2019t go to troubled teens, but similar physiological warfare due to religious family) \nI highly recommend the shroom therapy if you feel like you have some unhealed trauma. It sounds like you got it pretty covered if you were able to face her and laugh.

Your egg doner gave away her \u2018little girl\u2019, she has zero rights to any part of your life.", "NTA. My reply would simply be, I am what you made me.", "Did you at least tell her \"reap what you sow\"? Your parents made their choices and now they get the result.", "NTA, as you say, you may have been an asshole for laughing in her face, but honestly, I can't imagine any other way to react in that situation. I'm NC with my own mother, and I've learned that oftentimes, people who haven't had to make that kind of choice are incapable of understanding it. You can explain the pain they inflicted upon you, and someone will still say, \"But that's your mom,\" because even hearing about the trauma doesn't always click for people because they cannot imagine such a violation of that bond or how it really feels.\n\nPerhaps my opinion is not truly unbiased because I can directly relate to your situation, but I do not think you were cruel. What was cruel was sending a child to a camp to be abused so she would \"act right.\" What was cruel was not caring what would happen to you with people who were more than happy to have total control over the life of a vulnerable minor with zero oversight.\n\nReacting from a place of pain was not cruelty.", "NTA.

It\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t mean to do what she did. But the facts are she did do it, intended or not. You\u2019re not an asshole. But this is a complicated situation and you may feel differently later on when the shock has worn off. Either way, make sure you have someone you can speak to.", "NTA. \n\nfuck no. your parents hurt you. full stop. maybe not physically (or maybe so, i don\u2019t know), but by sending you to one of those horrendous camps. i\u2019ve only heard stories, and i imagine it\u2019s even worse than the stories at times. \n\nhard thing i\u2019ve faced tonight is that you would think family would be there for you and protect you, but they aren\u2019t. so when they aren\u2019t, you\u2019ve gotta pick up the pieces and protect yourself in any way necessary.", "NTA. At all. I\u2019m saying that as someone who went through a remarkably similar experience - on all fronts. Someone I love and trust once asked me to consider something - and didn\u2019t push it - just to consider\u2026 \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to forgive them because they deserve it. We forgive because we\u2019re releasing them from the prison that is our mind.\u201d \n\nFor years I thought that was some woo-woo bullshit. Today, I realize they were right. You don\u2019t have to be there for her or show up. Your pain is real and valid. She deserves nothing from you. But you might give yourself an unexpected gift if you can release her. Forgiveness can be a wholly selfish and self-serving endeavor.", "NTA. She can't come in after doing that to you, and expect everything to be forgiven and forgotten. Did you act like an AH? A little. But she was a bigger AH. I understand why you needed to get that off your chest.", "NTA. Those camps are cruel. You made it out of that family, don't look back.", "NTA", "NTA .

And she\u2019s only reaching out to heal her guilty conscience. But your still an ahole. Could\u2019ve said no, explained why and stayed no contact afterword. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Never have never will history constantly proves that.

Since you never mentioned any abuse by the parents I\u2019m going to say soft YTA. The camps are terrible and we know that now because of social media. 20 years ago parents believed whatever the recruiters told them and were usually desperate not to have their kid wind up dead or in prison. So yes the camp was terrible and no one doubts that, I\u2019m just doubting your parents knew that at the time. Have you ever talked to your parents about what went on there? Maybe telling your mom why you feel so strongly and let her know what you went through would open a good line of communication that you two have never had.", "Yes, you are the asshole.", "YTA.  Sorry.\n\nIt's quite a burden to carry that much hate with you for so long.

They shouldn\u2019t have traumatized you as a kid, and it\u2019s fine to go no contact with parents for emotional abuse/trauma/et cetera.
