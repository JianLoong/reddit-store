You can't stay with someone who gets mad over stupidness like that.", "NTA. As someone whose partner also values his family above all else, I sympathize. Don't jeopardize your job.", "NTA.

Maybe re-think the balance of power and fairness in your relationship? And he turns it around on you by saying that you clearly don\u2019t value family time as much as he does.\n\nWell, so what?!?!
