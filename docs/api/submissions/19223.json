I don\u2019t get how that doesn\u2019t make you an AB.", "you seem to forget the relationship between canada and the UK. you\u2019re all pissy because i said something about british people, but you can\u2019t comprehend why \u201chandicapped\u201d is offensive?", "what does me being a feminist have to do with you being an ableist \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "No, you personally find it stigmatizing. This isn\u2019t an objective thing.", "I do care assessments daily, and the number of people who tell me they are bedbound or wheelchair bound might actually surprise you. Also, having a disability doesn't give you the right to tell people what they can or can't say.", "No, /a whole bunch of people in the disability community who use wheelchairs find it stigmatising/. Do you personally identify as disabled? (Asking because you said before you have a handicap decal, which isn\u2019t quite the same)\nAre you involved with the community and activism? Or have you just decided that because you\u2019re fine with the wording everyone else must be? Because that\u2019s not very objective either.", "I didn\u2019t say whether or not you have to be fine with the term. Simply said whether or not it is offensive is completely subjective, because it is. I don\u2019t identify as disabled (because I think the term as a personal identifier is offensive, although I understand other people think differently and will use it for themselves and I use it conversation since we really don\u2019t have a better term). I have relapsing MS and have episodes where I would say I am wheelchair bound. I make these distinctions because of the nature of illness. I say I have a illness/disease.\n\nI am involved with others with MS. And the term isn\u2019t uncommon at all in those spaces."]}
