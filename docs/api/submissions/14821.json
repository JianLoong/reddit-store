Is there any unique or fancy thing about your sister's strawberry platter special or brands it?  Can you elaborate on the plating please?\n\nOr wait, I'm rereading.

I think that if your twin wasn't there, then it wouldn't have been an issue.  But it was their work that they created that you copied.  Try to think of it in terms of paintings.  One painter making a living at it.  The other was a novice presenting a painting that was in the style of the professional.  The party goers knew that they were being given a knockoff.

Or offer a reduced $.", "NTA \n\nIt would have been one thing if Alex had offered to make a similar platter in your price range or at a discount but it doesn't seem like they did so you did a DIY platter which is the kind of thing you do for a kid's birthday.", "NTA Do they think you\u2019re about to set up a competing bakery next door to Alex\u2019s business?

She gives you a price cheap enough for you to afford, but high enough that she is fully reimbursed for the actual costs.  You use her stuff for the party and make sure everyone knows it came from her, then some of those parents give her a call for their own party.", "Right?  six year olds don't care if it cost $150 or $15. Plus hand dipped strawberries have been around since the dawn of chocolate, it's not like Alex invented them.", "Most of the price mark-ups for those desserts are for the baker's experience.

Come to any high end bakery in most cities and they all have that same type of platter.", "I thought this too, but reading closer they say the strawberry's are one of 6 treats.

What about my relatives wants me to photo thier 11 hr wedding for free? \n\n Why should Alex give a product she sells for free?  If $150 is soooo much to pay for a kids party, why do y'all think she is stingy for not giving it?\n\nShe should bring her nephew a nice present, like a truck.  It's a thing the kid would like.\n\nWhat did you bring me auntie Alex?\n\nA $150 fruit tray.  Happy Birthday.\n\nWhen not presented from this view, I think reddit typically sides with the artist.\n\nI think it's one thing to snag an idea or imitate something you like, but I also think I wouldn't do this to my sister.

It's a who did it better move.", "I do think replicating something with that many components is definitely going into a territory of design theft.  Op took time to comment but also very directly did not answer.\n\nIt's also not a thing from Pinterest, it's a thing her sister supports herself by making.  So yes while she charges a lot, why do we expect this working artist to give it for free?  \n\nYou all are totally right op could have taken something off the internet so isn't it a little weird she makes twin's exact tray?\n\nI think op is not answering my question because it's a little more detailed than pretzels and strawberries.\n\nOp, can you please describe the final platter and what six items were on it?  How were the treats arranged?", "Lol, let's just wait for the twin tomorrow.  I've seen this before.", "They absolutely didn't have to do it for free, or even at cost.

OP did their own version (that OP admitted wasn\u2019t as nice as Alex\u2019s, but it\u2019s for a bunch of six year olds, so who cares) for less than a third of the cost.  Nothing wrong with that.  If you don\u2019t want people making their own versions of something, make it worth their while to get it from you instead.", "If she was selling it, I'd agree, but she literally just did it for own party so I don't see how it's design theft.", "If I see something on Facebook and not on Pinterest, is that different? I only ask because technically OP saw a picture and use that as reference to make their own thing.\n\nI totally understand that this is more personal because it happened to be inspired by their twin, however I'm not exactly sure why that makes it worse tbh.\n\nPersonally I think that it should have been offered at cost or just slightly above cost, since it was their twin. It wasn't like they asked for a discount, it was more like an inquiry. I've made slightly fancy cakes before, nothing too extravagant, and I couldn't imagine asking someone in my immediate family to pay full cost. Maybe a cousin or aunt, but definitely not a twin", "How is it design theft.  Simply having six desserts on a tray or the equivalent of savories (e.g. a charcuterie board) is not idea theft because it is extremely common for parties to have something like this. In general they are miniatures so that people can take a few different kinds rather than one big thing.\n\nThere is no unique intellectual property to protect\n\nSister was just pissed that OP didn't pay her $150 from her store. The greedy one in this example is actually the sister who could have offered to provide her with a dessert tray for a discount - enough to cover the cost of the ingredients", "Whichever one is posting, making a food instead of buying it at extremely inflated prices is not an asshole thing to do.", "And we also can't see it's not.", "It\u2019s definitely design theft, it\u2019s just not prosecutable since it was not sold\u2026 still a AH move towards a family member though.", "Again, I'm asking pointed questions to elicit if it is.  From the information given you can't include or discount that.\n\nBacon, ranch, cheddar is different from guava, mint, eggcreme.  Without knowing what and how common it is this cannot be determined.  But the number of variables involved and included in each would be the deciding factor and op does not provide that information.", "What's your job, and how many hours do you donate yearly in lieu of gifts for small children?", "No making your own food is not an asshole thing to do at all.  It's a good mom thing.\n\nBut I think there's some missing elements here in a closer read.  And I think there's some glossing over of things.", "I\u2019m not sure what Alex expected, charging $150 for a dessert tray.  I\u2019d commit \u201cdesign theft\u201d over those prices too.", "It doesn't really matter how much it looked alike tho? I could see an ad form a random bakery tomorrow and decide to recreate one of their desserts for a family function. That doesn't make it theft, especially if I'm not trying to resell it. The reason you pay other people to do these things is for skill, time, and effort. If someone lacking in skill wants to take those things on themselves, there's nothing wrong with that. OP would have only been in the wrong if they asked for a discount, or for this to be a gift.", "I don't understand your question - I give gifts to my nephews/nieces and children of close friends. I pay for those gifts with money I earn at my job. \n\nI didn't say she was obligated to do anything - only that many people in her position would provide a family discount under the circumstances.", "Exactly what would make her the asshole for making her own food? Because her twin makes the same thing? I\u2019ve made copycat food before. Have yet to get an attitude from Olive Garden or the Cheesecake Factory.

It seems like it's not simply OP made some food that her sister happens to make professionally, but rather the sister's thing had an added level of creativity to create a unique product that adds value and OP copied it. Is it AH level, probably not, but it's not exactly tactful to steal your sister's idea that she uses for her income and stick a poorly done version out there for everyone to see. This is your family after all, sometimes you just have to be a bit more aware of feelings than if it was some random professional you were dealing with."]}
