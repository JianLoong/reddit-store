I'm not really greedy but I would be bothered if money specifically meant for me was diverted to a cousin, regardless of how much I or you loved them.  If it's THAT important to YOU, why not take it out of YOUR savings, or take out a loan if need be.

Was it \"entirely her own money/assets\", or did Alice include \"money you have set aside for Alice\" as part of her will?", "Yta because you discussed this with you brother before even thinking to discuss it with your  daughter. You could have had an adult conversation with your adult daughter about finances and expectations and she may have been willing and happy to have the money go to her cousin. Instead, you decided to blindside her and force her into the position of being the bad guy and selfish and potentially causing rifts within the extended family\n\nAlso the way you talk about eldest daughters will is weird. Why were you surprised she left it to her sister? It was in her will so you didn't respect her wishes you obeyed the law? Did you think you should have recieve her assets?", "Yea, YTA. You saved and earmarked money for Sarah. There are probably people that could use it more than your niece. This is a flawed argument.", "INFO: what is the form of the college savings that you intended for Sarah but now want to take? Is it in a 529 plan or other college savings vehicle in her name?", "YTA - Just because Sarah got some money from her sister doesn't mean that you should be giving away the college fund you have FOR HER to someone else.  \n\nSarah should still get the money that you told her was for her schooling and then be able to use what's left for living expenses while in school.", "INFO\nhow much money did sarah inherit from alice? and how much did you have saved up for her?", "\"We were all surprised by this, but it's Alice's will so we respected her wishes.\"\n\nguess what it wouldnt matter if u respected it or not a will is a legal binding that by the court of law goes to the person deeded in the will which was daughter (alice sister)", "You control a college fund not the child.

Sorry for your loss OP first of all. I hope you and your family are grieving appropriately.\n\nBy the pure logic of your question, imo you are NTA, provided Sarah really doesn\u2019t need the money while she is going through law school. As this is your money that your set aside specifically for Sarah\u2019s education. She doesn\u2019t need it, imo you can do what you want with it. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think it was ok if you to talk about this with your brother and make this decision without even talking to Sarah. She should have been the first person you discussed this with. She is an adult and pretty sure had this fund in her future plans, but is now being told it\u2019s not there and is instead going to your niece.

Like it was your kind generosity that allowed Alice to leave Sarah her estate. \n\nSecond, just because she inherited money from her sister doesn't mean she meant to put it to law school. That could give her the means to make a decent start in life while getting her career off the ground. I wonder if Alice left it to her because Sarah does need it a lot more than you let on.\n\nThird: you told her the money you had was for her law school and you're pulling the rug out from under her. It seems like you're annoyed that Alice left her estate to Sarah and you want to punish her for it. Sounds like that is how Sarah is reading the situation, too. \n\nFourth: I think you're leaving a lot of context out, here, and given that Sarah doesn't want to talk to you, I'm willing to be this is the latest of many more things you've done to show her that she's not very important to you. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWhy did you speak to your brother before speaking to your daughter?\n\nI'm sure she'd rather have her sister than her inheritance.\n\nYou had already agreed to fund Sarah's law school, if there was money left over it could be used for something that Sarah needs.\n\nSarah's life isn't just wonderful because she suddenly inherited an apartment and the means to pay for law school, she lost her sibling who she will never get to go through life with as a support.\n\nHonestly - you are going to lose your other child because of this and YTA", "YTA but only in your handling of the situation, I don\u2019t think helping niece out is bad, especially if the families are close.

You say you\u2019re respecting Alice\u2019s wishes, but you\u2019re actually circumventing them.  Had Alice not left Sarah money, you would have used her college fund to pay for her college.

If so, Alice would have just given her money to your niece.", "YTA - no one knows the future. Sarah could get sick and need expensive medical care. You could lose your job or get disabled.

She also has an apartment and doesn't need it for housing purposes.

Should they still give the money to the kid to do whatever? No, because they no longer need it.\n\nI can get Sarah being frustrated but she's being pretty entitled here.

I thought about it and talked it over with my brother, and decided that the rest of the funds should be given to my niece to help her out. \n\nShe didn't take this well and started saying the money should be for her. I tried to explain to her that she doesn't need it for school, doesn't need it for a home, and her cousin could benefit from it more. Sarah said we should be keeping it in case she needs it in the future, or for a wedding, and that I'm giving everything to my nieces and nephews. She's now refusing to pick up calls.

So many of you are making such a giant leap of what if\u2019s. If this family has this much money to throw around- why do you think she wouldn\u2019t help Sarah when she gets married/if she gets sick/when her house blows up/when aliens abduct her pet pig and she has to pay ransom in beluga caviar!?!? Cool your nuts, all.", "Agree with the above. Am going to go with NTA, because I\u2019m a firm believer that you are never entitled to decide what someone does with their own money.

Giving up her OWN money go ahead. But what if Sarah has unexpected costs? That college could incurred. If OP and her husband have qn account for Sarah then they can Empty it and give it to niece. This money belonged to Alice that she left to Sarah. What if in the future she had unexpected costs it would kind of nice to have money to cover them.", "Mom is leaving inheritance to her nephews.

And then you said, \"great! Let me eliminate your trust fund\". That's not so much \"Sarah winning the lottery\" as it is \"you winning the lottery\". In that same vein, by taking away Sarah's trust fund, you essentially used a legal sleight of hand to turn Alice's gift to Sarah into Alice's gift to you.\n\nIMO, your trust fund should be used in full toward Sarah's law school education. And as long as Sarah pursues law, any amount left of Alice's gift is Sarah's to keep.
