Totally not something the secretary should have said or inserted herself into. Your son was on a educational website that yes, he probably shouldn't have been on at the time, but he was learning nonetheless and he accepted that he had done something wrong. I seriously don't understand how he and his friends were acting like idiots?? All these people that are agreeing with that I can guarantee 100% have been doing something other than the lesson at hand at school. They're kids, he owned up, and the secretary shouldn't have said that to him and his friends. NTA at all.", "NTA - I don't believe any adult should call a child an idiot, especially an educator.  That sticks with children especially coming from someone with authority.  Yes, he should have been punished and he would have but it can come without the name calling.", "NTA. I think her phasing was actually substantially different than calling them idiots (criticizing actions and not labeling the person themselves is a BIG topic in our household with elementary-aged kids), but she\u2019s clearly missing the bigger picture here. \n\nIt\u2019s inappropriate for her to pass judgement out loud on a group of kids sent to the office at all. She hasn\u2019t heard the full story or gotten their side, and wasn\u2019t going to be the one to do so. She can admonish them for things she\u2019s responsible for admonishing them for, and otherwise keep her mouth shut.", "That's not an apology at all.

But adults aren't allowed to say things to my kids that they can't say back. Would she have been okay with him saying, \"By saying that to me, you too are acting like an idiot.\" We all know that wouldn't have gone over well. Therefore, she shouldn't have said it either.

Please tell the secretary she's acting like an idiot.", "The number of people here who think it's okay to call or insinuate that a child is an idiot is GROSS. It's not about having thin skin or needing to toughen up or whatever other dumb bullshit people are arguing. It's about teaching children to be kind with their actions and words. What kind of message does it send when someone they should be able to trust speaks to them in such a disrespectful way? We should be teaching children that authority figures need to be held to the same standard *if not a higher one*. Blind acceptance of abuse by authority is a huge problem in society today. \n\nNTA. The secretary should not be working around children if she thinks it's appropriate to speak to a 2nd grader that way.", "NTA, get it sent to the news. That's the only way we got  our school to change anything.", "INFO:\n\nI am not a native speaker, so i feel something is getting lost in translation/ nuance here.\n\nSaying someone is acting like an idiot, means doing something idiotic. It doesn't mean they are an idiot? Browsing to another site in a way that you get caught is idiotic.\n\nIt's the nuance we teach our toddlers / kindergarteners when you tell them 'this is not a nice thing you are doing' vs 'you are not nice'. Behaviour does not equal being.", "Thing is they are different things tho", "NTA. I've always gotten a kick out of the whole \"judge the behavior, not the person\" thing.  In the adult word, it's not appropriate to call someone an idiot but apparently it is OK to tell someone that they are acting like an idiot. \n\nIMHO, this is a workaround by using more words to essentially say, \"you're an idiot\".\n\nBut those of us who are adults, we are supposed to understand the nuisances. Kids that young do not,  I would even go far as to say, most cannot.  \n\nWhat role does the school secretary play in discipline anyway?  The teacher admonished and sent them to the principal; they were not sent to the school secretary. Her job is to say \"hi, take a seat and I'll let the principal know that you are here\".  That's it.  \n\nYou read her intentions correctly. She was using doublespeak to call your kid an idiot.  She's crafty enough to know how to say it so she has a defense to fall back upon; regardless, she crossed the professional boundaries of her job duties, and she completely crossed the line by being unprofessional and rude to the kids.", "NTA. Idiot is not an appropriate word to use to an elementary schooler. Period. It\u2019s hurtful. I\u2019m working on excising it from my vocabulary to adults, actually, because of its ableist roots. It\u2019s also just not okay for her to involve herself in disciplinary scenarios.", "Who says that to a 2nd grader? NTA. I mean they were looking up a cool dinosaur website not porn. While it was still inappropriate during class, it doesn't warrant telling a impressionable little boy he is acting like an idiot. And that is no apology. Come on. \"I'm sorry you misunderstood what I said\" is absolute bullsh**", "NTA but saying you're acting like idiots is not the same as calling you an idiot. But to a kid that age it might seem the same.", "YTA, I'd say, Even though the secretary is wrong your child was still \"misbehaving\" and although he was \"acting like a idiot\" there is a difference, maybe just explain the concept better to him.", "YTA. They WERE acting like idiots, and who knows how they acted in the room with her. Let this go and acknowledge your kid did a dumb (albeit normal) kid thing and move on. This is not a hill to die on. Is it nice? Not really? Horrible? No.", "YTA. Your son was misbehaving. You are not doing your child any favours by teaching him to have such thin skin.", "YTA, you over reacted here, its ok to give kids a little bit of shit when they screw up. Don't blow this up and make a big deal about it. Teach your kid to be resilient", "YTA. You undermined the school's ability to discipline children and found it more important to be the word police. So instead of focusing on the misbehavior of your own child all of the attention went into a gotcha moment for an administrator.\n\nDo others really think it is that offensive to say a kid was \"acting like an idiot\" when they were misbehaving?", "YTA\n\nYour son and you were acting like idiots.\n\nAs we all do sometimes.", "Yta\n\nYour son was acting like an idiot. Also, acting like and idiot and being an idiot are two different things.", "Sorry, YTA.  Your kid is going to have a lot of situations where adults don\u2019t always act nicely. Teach him how to deal with it and what a proper adult might say if anything.  He should not rely on mommy coming to the rescue to put that mean adult in their place.", "YTA - she is not getting paid enough to deal with kids who, more than likely, really were acting like idiots. There is a difference between acting like an idiot and being an idiot and I think you\u2019re being too hard on her and not understanding of all she has to deal with. If she was actually verbally abusive and belittling your son, that would be one thing, but it sounds like she was just trying to get them to behave.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
