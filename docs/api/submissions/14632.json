Your sister obviously favors John.

Your sisters favoritism here is fairly obvious. Her actions and attitude make it clear that she sees deserving of celebration is John and that no comsideration of Claire was being given at all.\n\nThe issue with her schedule conflict alone speaks volumes on this. It should have caused at least some discussion of rescheduling.\n\nHeck, putting the whole \"she got into Ohio U.\" aspect aside, just being a member of the family should have warranted some talk of holding off a day or two. They should have wanted her to be a part of the celebration.\n\nInstead, they cared so little of their daughter, that they chose to leave her behind rather than adjust a little to facilitate her being there.\n\nAnother place I notice this is in her reaction to you and what you chose to do as compared to what the rest of the extended family is doing.\n\nYou mentioned this:\n\n>The entire extended family is proud of John, sending him tons of messages in chats and taking him out to dinners or sending gifts. But Claire is hardly being recognized...\n\nWhich I read as \"Everyone else is taking John to dinner, and if Claire is invited at all, its as nothing more than a sibling.\"\n\nAnd which makes this statement by your sister rather ironic:\n\n>Sara told me how much of an AH I was for excluding another child.\n\nWhy is it that she's ok with the exclusion of another child ok when it is John being celebrated but not ok when it's Claire? Oh yes, your sister said \"John deserved the dinner even more\".\n\nWhich makes me wonder, does John actually deserve so much celebration that Claire cannot not get any celebration at all? Because despite the fact that John has gotten multiple celebratory dinners and gifts from others in the family, she's upset that you've chosen to be the one person to give some attention to Claire.\n\nThe real answer is \"No\". No amount of achievement on John's part should negate the fact that Claire has also achieved something worthy of some celebration.\n\nWhat your sister and her husband have forgotten, if they ever learned it, is that as parents we should never compare our children to each other when it comes to celebrating them and their accomplishments. Each child is different. What is a noteworthy accomplishment is going to be different. Choosing to not celebrate one child at all because another child happens to have achieved something at the same time is favoritism and nothing else.\n\nKeep in celebrating Claire when she achieves stuff worthy of it. You can be sure that she'll still be talking with you. If your sister (and the rest of the family) can't figure this out, they might not be so lucky.", "NTA, and that threat about you not taking her children out again is pretty rich considering they are seniors in high school.

Fuck sara.", "NTA - Normally I'd play devils advocate - but in this case your just making sure the unrecognised child is getting some attention.\n\nYour doing nothing wrong.", "NTA. The benefit of being an aunt and not a mother is that you are not obligated to treat your niblings with 100% evenhandedness and fairness at all times ever for the rest of your lives. Especially as John and Claire are becoming young adults, it's perfectly normal for them to form preferences and particular bonds among their extended family as life circumstances match up. Older cousins mentor younger cousins who are in the same profession. A nephew who moves to the same city as Uncle X establishes a monthly coffee and catch-up with him. Cousins who happen to have kids at the same time support each other as they start their parenting journeys. \n\nIt sounds like Claire needs to feel appreciated and supported by an older member of her family, especially as she starts a new phase of her life. Your support will mean the world to her.", "NTA - you a great Aunt and your sister and BIL are huge assholes.  Your poor niece was probably feeling so down about being overshadowed and ignored, but I'm guessing it's been like that her whole life.\n\nYour sister is going to lose her daughter to her bias and it's going to serve her right.

As a kid who was forgotten for a golden child once upon a time.\n\nPS I AM LC with my parents. Why do you ask?\n\nI have to ask, is this a one-time thing or is this something you're been noticing might have been going on their entire childhood?  \n\nI'd recommend talking to her, if that is truly the family dynamic then you doing this for her, will come back at her in some way.   Withholding financial strings can be a common tactic if this isn't a one time situation.", "NTA. \n\nBut have you at least acknowledged John\u2019s acceptance?

I can't imagine it just started with the college admissions. It's probably been going on their entire lives and might even be part of the reason why the sister is less successful.

Claire not only got in to college, she did it while having the additional challenge of struggling with her mental health.\n\nHer difficulty level is higher.\n\nYour sister is betraying herself - she thinks her son deserves more than her daughter.

'Nuff sad", "NTA, I will say though that you might want to double check how you treated John in this scenario. The way Claire is being treated is absolutely horrible, but in my experience favoritism can still hurt even if you know why it\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve been in a similar, not super comparable situation as John and even though I could acknowledge why someone like Claire would get that special outing with you, I\u2019d still be sad that we hadn\u2019t had the chance to do the same. I\u2019d also be worried that you didn\u2019t like me because of how everyone else is treating me. It could be that John doesn\u2019t agree with how Claire is being treated either, and then is taking your actions as you placing the blame for her treatment on him. Obviously, this isn\u2019t your intention, but I can see how he could potentially feel this way. \n\nI would just make sure that you still made the effort to reach out to John as well, and if I had done this I honestly would\u2019ve taken them both out. If it was separately, in my time with Claire explained that she deserves just as much praise as her brother and anyone who tells her otherwise doesn\u2019t understand how hard she has also worked to be where she is. If it was together, I\u2019d just have Claire choose the dinner place since she didn\u2019t get to previously and then make the conscious effort to value both of them and make time for Claire to get to express her excitement. \n\nBut overall, NTA. Claire definitely deserves way more praise, Ohio State is still an amazing school, and Ivy leagues can be so overrated.", "NTA. You're a great human being.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI imagine a lot of the negativity towards you is because it's making them look bad not doing this for her as well.", "NTA They are not children anymore. There is nothing wrong with feeling closer to Clair. It seems that your sister wants to take everything from Clair and give it to John. She is the one playing favorites. She is not only playing favorites, she is being sadistic about it.  She wants to hurt Clair.  It's not enough that they are not recognizing Clair, she gets offended when someone does because it took away from John.  Clair needs to go live or no contact with this woman.", "Nta!! She's fortunate to have you", "NTA. I'm really glad to see you're supporting your Niece who seems to need it now more than ever. Just be a touch careful you don't lose contact with them entirely over this argument so you can remain some kind of lifeline for her!", "NTA Claire needs confirmation she's valued and loved, too", "Definitely NTA. These parents are expressing favoritism and it sounds like they have been for years. The nurtured flower grows taller, they should be grateful you\u2019re nurturing Claire because she deserves it too and because that nurturance will help her grow even more.", "NTA\n\nYou are a lovely person for doing this.

She also will be going no/low contact probably with her parents. This is clear golden child syndrome. Shame on the parents.", "NTA.\n\nJohn is clearly the golden child. Not enough info to know if Claire is the scapegoat or just more the forgotten child beside her overachieving brother, but either way she is clearly not a priority to either parent. I'm so glad she has you.\n\nThere's probably a lot of insidious little ways Claire is being made to feel unimportant at home that you don't get to see. This college admissions business is just the tip of the iceberg, I'd bet my buttons on it. The parents' extreme anger over this dinner only makes sense in that context (i.e. that giving Claire any attention is unconscionable because all the attention should go to John).\n\nFortunately, Claire is (or is very nearly) an adult, so your sister can't really cut you off from her. I hope you can be there for Claire as she navigates college, because she sure has no other adult in her corner.", "NTA. The Ivy leaguer did fine. An act of appreciation for her was overdue. It appears it didn\u2019t happen at home.", "NTA for taking your niece out. Your sister though. \n\nJust tell her \"Celebrating Claire doesn't take anything away from John. If John feels that way then you should all take a moment to reflect on how it might have felt when you guys decided to leave Claire behind while you went to a celebration.
