Your sister obviously favors John.

Your sisters favoritism here is fairly obvious. Her actions and attitude make it clear that she sees deserving of celebration is John and that no comsideration of Claire was being given at all.\n\nThe issue with her schedule conflict alone speaks volumes on this. It should have caused at least some discussion of rescheduling.\n\nHeck, putting the whole \"she got into Ohio U.\" aspect aside, just being a member of the family should have warranted some talk of holding off a day or two. They should have wanted her to be a part of the celebration.\n\nInstead, they cared so little of their daughter, that they chose to leave her behind rather than adjust a little to facilitate her being there.\n\nAnother place I notice this is in her reaction to you and what you chose to do as compared to what the rest of the extended family is doing.\n\nYou mentioned this:\n\n>The entire extended family is proud of John, sending him tons of messages in chats and taking him out to dinners or sending gifts. But Claire is hardly being recognized...\n\nWhich I read as \"Everyone else is taking John to dinner, and if Claire is invited at all, its as nothing more than a sibling.\"\n\nAnd which makes this statement by your sister rather ironic:\n\n>Sara told me how much of an AH I was for excluding another child.\n\nWhy is it that she's ok with the exclusion of another child ok when it is John being celebrated but not ok when it's Claire? Oh yes, your sister said \"John deserved the dinner even more\".\n\nWhich makes me wonder, does John actually deserve so much celebration that Claire cannot not get any celebration at all? Because despite the fact that John has gotten multiple celebratory dinners and gifts from others in the family, she's upset that you've chosen to be the one person to give some attention to Claire.\n\nThe real answer is \"No\". No amount of achievement on John's part should negate the fact that Claire has also achieved something worthy of some celebration.\n\nWhat your sister and her husband have forgotten, if they ever learned it, is that as parents we should never compare our children to each other when it comes to celebrating them and their accomplishments. Each child is different. What is a noteworthy accomplishment is going to be different. Choosing to not celebrate one child at all because another child happens to have achieved something at the same time is favoritism and nothing else.\n\nKeep in celebrating Claire when she achieves stuff worthy of it. You can be sure that she'll still be talking with you. If your sister (and the rest of the family) can't figure this out, they might not be so lucky.", "NTA, and that threat about you not taking her children out again is pretty rich considering they are seniors in high school.

Fuck sara.", "NTA - Normally I'd play devils advocate - but in this case your just making sure the unrecognised child is getting some attention.\n\nYour doing nothing wrong.", "NTA. The benefit of being an aunt and not a mother is that you are not obligated to treat your niblings with 100% evenhandedness and fairness at all times ever for the rest of your lives. Especially as John and Claire are becoming young adults, it's perfectly normal for them to form preferences and particular bonds among their extended family as life circumstances match up. Older cousins mentor younger cousins who are in the same profession. A nephew who moves to the same city as Uncle X establishes a monthly coffee and catch-up with him. Cousins who happen to have kids at the same time support each other as they start their parenting journeys. \n\nIt sounds like Claire needs to feel appreciated and supported by an older member of her family, especially as she starts a new phase of her life. Your support will mean the world to her.", "NTA - you a great Aunt and your sister and BIL are huge assholes.  Your poor niece was probably feeling so down about being overshadowed and ignored, but I'm guessing it's been like that her whole life.\n\nYour sister is going to lose her daughter to her bias and it's going to serve her right.

As a kid who was forgotten for a golden child once upon a time.\n\nPS I AM LC with my parents. Why do you ask?\n\nI have to ask, is this a one-time thing or is this something you're been noticing might have been going on their entire childhood?  \n\nI'd recommend talking to her, if that is truly the family dynamic then you doing this for her, will come back at her in some way.   Withholding financial strings can be a common tactic if this isn't a one time situation.", "NTA. \n\nBut have you at least acknowledged John\u2019s acceptance?

One kid got first place the other a participation ribbon.", "I disagree with the fair not to move john's dinner. The fact he got a dinner and they didn't do one for his sister as well speaks volumes.

He's not the one treating her unfairly. \n\nI'm not saying it needs to be as fancy a dinner or what have you, but yeah - he's the one being excluded from celebrating w his aunt *BECAUSE* of how OTHER people are treating him. \n\nOP is no better in a sense - both should be celebrated and not subject to being accountable for how other people view their accomplishments/choices.\n\nIt'd be different if OP wasn't equally their aunt but she is.", "*5 years time mum is on AITA asking why her daughter doesn't talk to her.*\n\n>The end.", ">He's not the one treating her unfairly.\n\nHe is old enough, and supposedly intelligent, so that he realises what's happening and how awful it is for his sister.

If he does, well then, he's his mother's son.", "Still missing the point.\n\nIt's not about making it \"fair\" - it's about celebrating a milestone with his aunt. \n\nMaybe you don't have a great rel with your niblings but I think that's giving everyone else too much influence instead of just looking at the actual human. \n\nIt's not about the dinner at all.
