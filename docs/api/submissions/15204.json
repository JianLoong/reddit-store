I\u2019m so proud of her, I can\u2019t say that enough.\n\nMy son Luke is graduating from high school this year, and I found out that his graduation is a few days after my daughter\u2019s. We don\u2019t live very close by anymore, so it would be back and forth flights which just doesn\u2019t feel practical. Since May is getting another degree, I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019ll attend her next graduation, but this time I\u2019m just going to attend her brother\u2019s since graduating highschool is such a big step.\n\nMay seemed a little upset at first but she told me it was fine and that she understood. My ex called me later and told me that I wasn\u2019t considering May\u2019s feelings in the slightest. Her HS graduation in 2020 was canceled due to lockdown, then her ceremony for her AA was virtual for the same reason, so now that she\u2019s finally having one, my not going has really hurt her.\n\nI told my ex that I\u2019d go to her next one, and that it\u2019s not fair that I just not show up for her brother. He says that it\u2019s more than possible for me to come see her graduate and then fly back in time to see my son do the same. My thing is that yes, it\u2019s possible, but it isn\u2019t practical. \n\nMay told me herself that she is a little upset about it, which is why she vented to her dad, but she apologized for making it an issue.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel about this now. Am I being an AH here?\n\nETA:\n\nMy daughter found this post, which wasn't my intention, but I did reach out to her to apologize for not being considerate of how this was going to make her feel. I'm going to fly out earlier to spend more time with her and to attend her graduation ceremony.", "created_utc": 1681931361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s6r94/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_ill_be_missing/", "score": 4899, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it doesn\u2019t seem practical.\n\n\nMy other question is why is it even relevant of which parent she grew up with primarily? Both are your children. It shouldn\u2019t matter if she grew up with her dad.", "YTA\n\n\n\"I go to your next one\" is sooo shitty. \n\n\nAnd it is completly your decision to not fly in earlier or to just suck it up and put in effort. \n\n\nYou deem to really be a weekend parent to the heart.", "YTA. \n\nI Wonder why your kid ended living with her father full time...", ">My thing is that yes, it\u2019s possible, but it isn\u2019t practical. \n\nYTA.

It's not \"practical\" to support both your children. Gotcha.", "YTA! It's possible so MAKE IT SO!\n\nCovid cancelled 2 milestones of her life.

She is SO hurt she talked to her dad about it. Don't dismiss this!\n\nEdit: I just looked at the dates. She graduated in 3 years even WITH the Covid lockdowns! I also graduated in 3 years without that challenge. I would have been devastated if my parents blew off my graduation for another sibling.", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s some low down parenting. You\u2019re more worried about the inconvenience of travel and not your child\u2019s feelings.", "YTA. Massive one at that. Jesus, it's \"possible but not practical?\" WHO FUCKING CARES. You have two kids, not one kid and an estranged relative. Act like it, for Christ's sake. Your daughter already missed out on even *having* a high school graduation. Who's to say college graduation isn't just as important? \n\nActually, why are you even prioritizing one of your kids? Your son is graduating high school a few days after her graduation? JUST GO TO BOTH. Suck it up, put in the effort, and support her. She's your DAUGHTER.

Sorry baby I\u2019m not going to your first real graduation because it is just not practical. Also you say that you are proud of her why not show her by going? Hugging her and telling her there?

You\u2019ve also proven to your daughter where she stands in your life and it shows you care more about your son than her.

High school means nothing in the long run, and your daughter is a superstar.", "YTA - \n\nDoesn't \"feel\" practical?  Feelings and practicality usually don't fit together.   Book a flight and be there for her.

Spend the extra money, bust ass and do both. Run between airport gates, take Ubers, whatever it takes.", "YTA, 100%. Your post states that your son will be graduating \u201ca few days after\u201d your daughter. This means that it\u2019s possible for you to attend both. You say it\u2019s not \u201cpractical\u201d to do both, apparently due to your dislike for \u201cback to back flights,\u201d but you never said it\u2019s impossible. It is possible. You\u2019re just choosing not to.\n\nHate to break it to you, but you owe it to both of your children to be there for both of them on their graduation day. Especially since apparently they both want your support. You don\u2019t get to pick one over the other simply because that\u2019s what\u2019s \u201cpractical\u201d for you.\n\nAlso, your excuse about your daughter having an additional graduation in the future is BS. Are you telling me that your son isn\u2019t also going to have a college graduation in the future?

You didn\u2019t even get to attend her high school graduation due to lockdown. Be a good parent, and attend both events.", "YTA - you have TWO children, not one.  You owe it to them both to be there.  And it can be done, you just don't want to.

Sure might be a bit exhausting but you'd be there for both your children. I'm sure it's not often they graduate.\n\nPlus I don't feel like HS graduation is on the same level as Master's graduation. And what happens life happens and she doesn't finish the next degree?", "YTA - I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t pick. Your daughter is going to feel like you hate her. She likely already feels hurt around not seeing you much growing up and now you are picking her half brother over her. If you do this, she will always believe you like him more. \n\nThis is an important event in both of their lives, you need to be there for both if you don\u2019t want her to forever have hurt feelings", "YTA, if it\u2019s possible for you to do it you need to do it.

Do you want to be that kind of mom?", "YTA. If you are able to go to both graduations, then you  should. Who cares if it\u2019s not practical?

What would  it require  to pull this off?", "YTA\n\nIf it's possible but you're not going to make the effort then you're basically telling your daughter that her brother's more important.\n\nAfter having one graduation cancelled and then having it online I'd have thought you'd make damn sure you'd attend this one.  The future isn't certain and as crazy as the world is at the moment you might not get the opportunity to attend her next graduation.  \n\nYou may say how proud you are of her to infinity, but actions speak louder than words.", "YTA. If you can make both and choose not too you are a massive AH. Your daughter is obviously upset and only apologised as to keep the peace because she is clearly more mature and considerate than you. You should be honoured to attend. Shame on you...", "YTA\n\nIt is very apparent to your daughter that you don't care much about her.  She only visited you on weekends and you are putting a HS graduation way ahead of her college graduation, especially when you could definitely go to both.  \n\nYour pathetic excuse...PRACTICALITY?\n\nI feel really bad for your daughter.  Do you realize that you probably make her feel like a mistake, a marriage outcome to erase?   \n\nShe stopped visiting as she got older (\"May primarily stayed with her father but visited us on the weekends when she was younger\").  Does this mean her teenage years when it became apparent that she was an outsider to your family, including you?\n\nHave you EVER thought what she feels like?  Put HER feelings first?   \n\nYour whole refusal is just for your convenience.  \n\nBeing a parent sometimes doing things that are inconvenient and impractical for the benefit of your children.  Grow up and BE a parent to your oldest child!", "YTA. She has had 2 graduations that you have not attended. Doesn't matter if they were canceled or virtual, YOU WEREN'T THERE. Now she is finally having one that her family can attend in person to celebrate her accomplishment and your not going because it's inconvenient. Sounds like she's use to being disappointed by you, which is probably why she didn't make the bigger deal of it, like she should have. Why don't you skip your sons, that you see everyday to go to your daughters that you only saw on weekends because of \"life and circumstances\"? Because he is more important to you than she is, that is what your actions show. Stop being selfish and do the right thing, whether it's going to both or just hers, but not going to hers is the wrong choice.", "YTA\n\nI had two different graduations on the same night at opposite ends of the county. You're doing what I refused to do. You're putting one child over the other. We get it. Your son is the golden child.", "YTA it sounds inconvenient for sure to fly back and forth, but isn't celebrating both of your children's special days worth it?", "You're not going to be *invited* to her next one if you do this.  YTA.", "YTA you could make it happen, it\u2019s just isn\u2019t practically. That alone shows how much your value your relationship with her.", "Most people graduate high school. But a degree is a big deal.\nPlus no one was able to go to her previous ones because of lockdown. She deserves to finally have her mother and others be there for the first one. If this is both kids first graduation then I think a degree takes priority.\n\nPlus, what if, for whatever reason, she doesn't end up doing her masters and graduating again?\n\nGo to both if you can but if not go to hers.", "YTA.\n\nYou should be willing to move mountains to attend both \u2014 and you definitely can do that, even if it\u2018s a little inconvenient for you. Your favoritism is awful and your response is overly insensitive.", "YTA.\n\n Not practical? Sorry but you are a parent. It is your job to prioritize both kids. If you said you were destitute or something, fine, I could at least see your point. As it stands? No way. If your daughter is slightly upset now, it is likely to get worse with time. This is one of those things that can fester and turn into a huge issue later. Further. It could impact how your daughter feels about your son. I know if it were me it would be very hard not to resent him a little and feel hurt by this move. If you do this, prepare yourself. This could lead to a permanent wedge between the two of you. If it were my graduation and my mom said this? I would be both heartbroken and angry.", "Kind of feel like YTA.\n\nFor such big moments in your children's lives, maybe make the \"unpractical\" plans work and just deal with the back and forth. In my opinion, it would be worth it to be there for both of them, especially if your daughter's previous graduations had been canceled.  They are not on the same day, it is not impossible, so I'd try a bit harder to be at both .", "YTA. If you can make both and choose not too you are a massive AH.

Since May is getting another degree, I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019ll attend her next graduation, but this time I\u2019m just going to attend her brother\u2019s since graduating highschool is such a big step.\n\nMay seemed a little upset at first but she told me it was fine and that she understood. My ex called me later and told me that I wasn\u2019t considering May\u2019s feelings in the slightest. Her HS graduation in 2020 was canceled due to lockdown, then her ceremony for her AA was virtual for the same reason, so now that she\u2019s finally having one, my not going has really hurt her.\n\nI told my ex that I\u2019d go to her next one, and that it\u2019s not fair that I just not show up for her brother. He says that it\u2019s more than possible for me to come see her graduate and then fly back in time to see my son do the same. My thing is that yes, it\u2019s possible, but it isn\u2019t practical. \n\nMay told me herself that she is a little upset about it, which is why she vented to her dad, but she apologized for making it an issue.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel about this now.

Not saying they can\u2019t come back from it but it\u2019s going to be a big step.

She shouldn\u2019t be giving ANY APOLOGY BUT RECEIVING \n\nI guess out of sight, out of mind. Like I guess since May lived/lives with dad\u2014she\u2019s not really seen as a daughter 100% since you don\u2019t actually raise.

Like why waste a ticket on someone who didn\u2019t even want to go in the first place because of impracticality.

I read a lot of excuses for you not attending her graduation. The only thing impractical here WAS the excuses. You were straight up choosing your son over your daughter and you were right in admitting not considering her feelings.

When I finally got brave enough to go to the campus police, the officer who took my report looked at me skeptically when I gave him the guy's name (one of those that might have been funny, were it not for the situation) and never followed through on anything. Something triggered me when I went home for Thanksgiving about a month after the assault, and when I ran to my bedroom, my dad followed me and told me, *Get over it or die. Worse things happen to people every day. Just get over it or die.* \n\nBecause of all of that up there ^^^, I have totally blanked out on almost a year of my life. I remember bits and pieces, but for the most part I couldn't tell you what happened. I had to take an incomplete in a class because there was a huge research paper I was supposed to do and I just...couldn't. I couldn't sit down and focus, couldn't gather coherent thoughts together enough for this massive task. So I had to stay an extra semester and take another class to replace that one. My dad was pissed.\n\nSo I ended up going through December graduation instead of a traditional May graduation. Granted, I didn't give my parents a ton of notice. But they were also retired, living an hour away, and had zero plans. And they still grumbled about coming to my college graduation that I hadn't informed them of well in advance. \n\nThey *came*. But I will not ever forget my father's words to me that Thanksgiving. I will not ever forget how pissed off he was that it took me one extra semester to get my degree after going through a sort of hell. I will not ever forget how much of an inconvenience my parents thought it was to drive an hour to attend my university graduation ceremony. Those moments stand out. As does the moment I finished up photos with the friends who did come and walked out into the dark, alone, and started crying. \n\n_OP, your daughter will *never* forget this. You are, and forever will be, TA.
