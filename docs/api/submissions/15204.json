I\u2019m so proud of her, I can\u2019t say that enough.\n\nMy son Luke is graduating from high school this year, and I found out that his graduation is a few days after my daughter\u2019s. We don\u2019t live very close by anymore, so it would be back and forth flights which just doesn\u2019t feel practical. Since May is getting another degree, I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019ll attend her next graduation, but this time I\u2019m just going to attend her brother\u2019s since graduating highschool is such a big step.\n\nMay seemed a little upset at first but she told me it was fine and that she understood. My ex called me later and told me that I wasn\u2019t considering May\u2019s feelings in the slightest. Her HS graduation in 2020 was canceled due to lockdown, then her ceremony for her AA was virtual for the same reason, so now that she\u2019s finally having one, my not going has really hurt her.\n\nI told my ex that I\u2019d go to her next one, and that it\u2019s not fair that I just not show up for her brother. He says that it\u2019s more than possible for me to come see her graduate and then fly back in time to see my son do the same. My thing is that yes, it\u2019s possible, but it isn\u2019t practical. \n\nMay told me herself that she is a little upset about it, which is why she vented to her dad, but she apologized for making it an issue.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel about this now.

Even if it doesn\u2019t seem practical.\n\n\nMy other question is why is it even relevant of which parent she grew up with primarily? Both are your children. It shouldn\u2019t matter if she grew up with her dad.", "YTA\n\n\n\"I go to your next one\" is sooo shitty. \n\n\nAnd it is completly your decision to not fly in earlier or to just suck it up and put in effort. \n\n\nYou deem to really be a weekend parent to the heart.", "YTA. \n\nI Wonder why your kid ended living with her father full time...", ">My thing is that yes, it\u2019s possible, but it isn\u2019t practical. \n\nYTA.

You just don't want to be bothered to go out of your way to do it", "YTA.\n\nYou state, numerous times, that it's possible for you to make it to both--but you're not willing to put in the effort.

It's not \"practical\" to support both your children. Gotcha.", "YTA! It's possible so MAKE IT SO!\n\nCovid cancelled 2 milestones of her life. Now, for the absolute MASSIVE achievement of graduating from college and EARNING her BA, you plan to skip because it is \"impractical\"!!! If I were her, I would be crushed that my mother could not even be bothered to be inconvenienced to make an effort to attend!!!\n\nShe is downplaying to you how hurt this makes her. She is SO hurt she talked to her dad about it. Don't dismiss this!\n\nEdit: I just looked at the dates. She graduated in 3 years even WITH the Covid lockdowns! I also graduated in 3 years without that challenge. I would have been devastated if my parents blew off my graduation for another sibling.", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s some low down parenting. You\u2019re more worried about the inconvenience of travel and not your child\u2019s feelings.", "YTA. Massive one at that. Jesus, it's \"possible but not practical?\" WHO FUCKING CARES. You have two kids, not one kid and an estranged relative. Act like it, for Christ's sake. Your daughter already missed out on even *having* a high school graduation. Who's to say college graduation isn't just as important? \n\nActually, why are you even prioritizing one of your kids? Your son is graduating high school a few days after her graduation? JUST GO TO BOTH. Suck it up, put in the effort, and support her. She's your DAUGHTER. If you're so proud of her, actually BE there for her instead of blowing off one of the most momentous days of her life.", "YTA. Go to both. Sorry baby I\u2019m not going to your first real graduation because it is just not practical. Also you say that you are proud of her why not show her by going? Hugging her and telling her there? Graduation is a big thing especially the first\u2026", "YTA!!! \n\nYour ex is right you don\u2019t care about her feelings. You\u2019ve missed TWO of her ceremonies now technically. You\u2019ve also proven to your daughter where she stands in your life and it shows you care more about your son than her. That\u2019s why she\u2019s apologizing for your decision, because she feels let down by her own mother. High school means nothing in the long run, and your daughter is a superstar.", "YTA - \n\nDoesn't \"feel\" practical?  Feelings and practicality usually don't fit together.   Book a flight and be there for her.   Yes, you'll spend, yes you'll be tired, yes it's a pain in the butt, however good parents endure a little pain to keep their children from feeling unloved.   \n\nBook now, update us when you are done.", "YTA, who cares if it\u2019s \u201cpractical\u201d? Spend the extra money, bust ass and do both. Run between airport gates, take Ubers, whatever it takes.", "YTA, 100%. Your post states that your son will be graduating \u201ca few days after\u201d your daughter. This means that it\u2019s possible for you to attend both. You say it\u2019s not \u201cpractical\u201d to do both, apparently due to your dislike for \u201cback to back flights,\u201d but you never said it\u2019s impossible. It is possible. You\u2019re just choosing not to.\n\nHate to break it to you, but you owe it to both of your children to be there for both of them on their graduation day. Especially since apparently they both want your support. You don\u2019t get to pick one over the other simply because that\u2019s what\u2019s \u201cpractical\u201d for you.\n\nAlso, your excuse about your daughter having an additional graduation in the future is BS. Are you telling me that your son isn\u2019t also going to have a college graduation in the future? I suppose it\u2019s possible, but I suspect that\u2019s not the case.\n\nStop playing favorites with your children.", "YTA\n\nI graduated college on a Saturday in a different state, and my sister graduated high school in our home state on the following Wednesday.

You didn\u2019t even get to attend her high school graduation due to lockdown. Be a good parent, and attend both events.", "YTA - you have TWO children, not one.  You owe it to them both to be there.  And it can be done, you just don't want to.  In 4 years, when Luke is graduating from college at the same time that May is earning her Master's will you still choose Luke and try to justify it?", "Info:  What was your plan if let's say your son graduation was first....you'll still have to fly there won't you?", "I'm sorry but I do feel like YTA, specially given the other canceled graduations. \n\nWhy not the flights back and forth? Sure might be a bit exhausting but you'd be there for both your children. I'm sure it's not often they graduate.\n\nPlus I don't feel like HS graduation is on the same level as Master's graduation. And what happens life happens and she doesn't finish the next degree?", "YTA - I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t pick. Your daughter is going to feel like you hate her. She likely already feels hurt around not seeing you much growing up and now you are picking her half brother over her. If you do this, she will always believe you like him more. \n\nThis is an important event in both of their lives, you need to be there for both if you don\u2019t want her to forever have hurt feelings", "YTA, if it\u2019s possible for you to do it you need to do it.  This isn\u2019t about your comfort, you aren\u2019t going on vacation, even if it\u2019s a pain to fly on back to back days, do it for your kids.  \n\nYour daughter will always remember that you didn\u2019t show up for her when you could have.  Do you want to be that kind of mom?", "YTA. If you are able to go to both graduations, then you  should. Who cares if it\u2019s not practical?

What would  it require  to pull this off?", "YTA\n\nIf it's possible but you're not going to make the effort then you're basically telling your daughter that her brother's more important.\n\nAfter having one graduation cancelled and then having it online I'd have thought you'd make damn sure you'd attend this one.  The future isn't certain and as crazy as the world is at the moment you might not get the opportunity to attend her next graduation.  \n\nYou may say how proud you are of her to infinity, but actions speak louder than words.", "YTA. If you can make both and choose not too you are a massive AH. Your daughter is obviously upset and only apologised as to keep the peace because she is clearly more mature and considerate than you. You should be honoured to attend. Shame on you...", "YTA\n\nIt is very apparent to your daughter that you don't care much about her.  She only visited you on weekends and you are putting a HS graduation way ahead of her college graduation, especially when you could definitely go to both.  \n\nYour pathetic excuse...PRACTICALITY?\n\nI feel really bad for your daughter.  Do you realize that you probably make her feel like a mistake, a marriage outcome to erase?   \n\nShe stopped visiting as she got older (\"May primarily stayed with her father but visited us on the weekends when she was younger\").  Does this mean her teenage years when it became apparent that she was an outsider to your family, including you?\n\nHave you EVER thought what she feels like?  Put HER feelings first?   \n\nYour whole refusal is just for your convenience.  \n\nBeing a parent sometimes doing things that are inconvenient and impractical for the benefit of your children.  Grow up and BE a parent to your oldest child!", "YTA. She has had 2 graduations that you have not attended. Doesn't matter if they were canceled or virtual, YOU WEREN'T THERE. Now she is finally having one that her family can attend in person to celebrate her accomplishment and your not going because it's inconvenient. Sounds like she's use to being disappointed by you, which is probably why she didn't make the bigger deal of it, like she should have. Why don't you skip your sons, that you see everyday to go to your daughters that you only saw on weekends because of \"life and circumstances\"? Because he is more important to you than she is, that is what your actions show. Stop being selfish and do the right thing, whether it's going to both or just hers, but not going to hers is the wrong choice.", "YTA\n\nI had two different graduations on the same night at opposite ends of the county. You're doing what I refused to do. You're putting one child over the other. We get it. Your son is the golden child.", "YTA it sounds inconvenient for sure to fly back and forth, but isn't celebrating both of your children's special days worth it?", "You're not going to be *invited* to her next one if you do this.  YTA.", "YTA you could make it happen, it\u2019s just isn\u2019t practically. That alone shows how much your value your relationship with her.", "Most people graduate high school. But a degree is a big deal.\nPlus no one was able to go to her previous ones because of lockdown. She deserves to finally have her mother and others be there for the first one. If this is both kids first graduation then I think a degree takes priority.\n\nPlus, what if, for whatever reason, she doesn't end up doing her masters and graduating again?\n\nGo to both if you can but if not go to hers.", "YTA.\n\nYou should be willing to move mountains to attend both \u2014 and you definitely can do that, even if it\u2018s a little inconvenient for you. Your favoritism is awful and your response is overly insensitive.", "YTA.\n\n Not practical? Sorry but you are a parent. It is your job to prioritize both kids. If you said you were destitute or something, fine, I could at least see your point. As it stands? No way. If your daughter is slightly upset now, it is likely to get worse with time. This is one of those things that can fester and turn into a huge issue later. Further. It could impact how your daughter feels about your son. I know if it were me it would be very hard not to resent him a little and feel hurt by this move. If you do this, prepare yourself. This could lead to a permanent wedge between the two of you. If it were my graduation and my mom said this? I would be both heartbroken and angry.", "Kind of feel like YTA.\n\nFor such big moments in your children's lives, maybe make the \"unpractical\" plans work and just deal with the back and forth. In my opinion, it would be worth it to be there for both of them, especially if your daughter's previous graduations had been canceled.  They are not on the same day, it is not impossible, so I'd try a bit harder to be at both .", "YTA. If you can make both and choose not too you are a massive AH.

Not being practical is not a good enough excuse to blow off something that means a great deal to her.", "YTA\n\nAnd I say that even though I came here with the full intention of saying you weren't the asshole, because I graduated from law school the same weekend two of my sibs had their bachelor's degree graduations\u2014all several hundred miles from each other. \n\nSo I understand not being able to be two places at once. \n\nYou, however, seem to have the time *and* the wherewithal to attend both ceremonies. It would just be inconvenient. \n\nYou'll have plenty of time to get back to your son's graduation since it's \"a few days after\" your daughter's. Go to your daughter's a few days early, spend some time with her, and leave immediately after the graduation ceremony. If it's a morning ceremony, take him for a nice lunch and leave that night.

If I were your daughter rn I\u2019d disown you immediately. As a parent, you always need to show up for your kids.

So this one acquires even more importance because she didn\u2019t get to have her high school one. Yet you think it\u2019s fine to just shrug that off because it\u2019s personally inconvenient to you?

But I don't get the sense that is the case. You state that flying \"just doesn't feel practical\".

My ex called me later and told me that I wasn\u2019t considering May\u2019s feelings in the slightest. Her HS graduation in 2020 was canceled due to lockdown, then her ceremony for her AA was virtual for the same reason, so now that she\u2019s finally having one, my not going has really hurt her.\n\nI told my ex that I\u2019d go to her next one, and that it\u2019s not fair that I just not show up for her brother.

I.e., 'I could have, but then I'd have had to actually make some effort'.  I'm picking daughter has been hearing this excuse most of her life :-(", "Seriously.

That may have been how you felt about your own, but it is not the case to others. A milestone is still a milestone even if it isn't a college degree, which not everyone has.\n\nOP: My mom was unable to attend my middle school graduation due to an amazing program she got to attend to help her get her Masters Degree. I was very upset about it but have since forgiven her. She went to all of my brothers milestones for school but not mine. I now think what she was able to go and do was an amazing opportunity and saw how much she learned and got to do that I didn't recognize as a good reason to miss it when I was 14. She never missed a school event after that either. Your reason to miss her graduation for her BA is awful and so much more selfish than 14 me would ever have considered my mom's reason to miss my middle school graduation. You really are heartless and clearly only care about your son. YTA", "Graduating from high school is still worth celebrating. OP should go to both regardless.", "A very small percentage of kids go on to college so high school is very likely the only graduation they will have.", "It really does depend on who you ask. I skipped my high school graduation, but my college graduation was one of the best and most important days of my life. Some people see both as equally important.", "Yeah it's not even a thing in the UK to graduate from high school, well at least in scotland it isn't. That's why they're called undergrad degrees I believe.", "HS graduation is like a rite of passage, though.  Students get to close a chapter of their life, while celebrating with friends and family.\n\nEdited to add: This still does not make it any more important than the daughter's graduation.", "OP shouldn\u2019t choose between her children. She said she could make it to both ceremonies. She doesn\u2019t want the inconvenience of flying and then coming back to make a quick turnaround to her sons graduation. It\u2019s crappy regardless choosing one ceremony over the other. They are both important because her children both have accomplished something great.", "You favor your new family just admit that to yourself already.", "Okay... so you want to spend a few days with your daughter which isn't possible after her graduation. Why don't you just go to see her a few days BEFORE her graduation? Oh wait I bet you have a lame excuse for that too. YTA", "INFO-how many days exactly between the two and how many miles?  I\u2019m going to my son\u2019s choral concert on a Tuesday night and getting up at 3 am the next morning for a 11 hour drive so I can make it to my niece\u2019s HS graduation 5 pm that day bc I love them.

The zoned high school coordinator got stuck on being alphabetical and said they couldn't make any adjustments and I should contact them in May. I said you'll be hearing from me before that. Attorney called the St Petersburg Times. Times called the zoned high school. Zoned high school backed off and said they could schedule her last. Magnet school agreed to call her first.

It was either make it to both or don't go to either one.", "I flew 14 hours from central Europe to Seattle for a friend's wedding, and then back for another friend's wedding six days later.

I got on a early morning flight, changed during my 45 minute layover (I was going from -5 and snow to 70 and sunny!), did my makeup on my 2nd flight, and made it to the ceremony in time to give her a hug before she had to line up. 24 hours later I was on my return flight, because I had finals the next day. Yes, it may have been more \u201cpractical\u201d for me to not go, but she is my sister and I could make it work, so I did!", "Master\u2019s programs and AA programs are both usually around two years, so she could be in this exact situation a couple years down the road- and I bet she\u2019d also choose her son then.", "This is exactly it. \n\nHonestly, I wonder if the son was not graduating around the same time, if OP would still be on this sub asking, \"AITA for not attending my daughter's graduation\" for some other poor excuse.", "My heart breaks for her daughter.

OP: YTA.", "I think it would be a whirlwind *depending on how long the flights are*, **BUT** it is still very doable.  I have done trips like this before (cross country flights within a few days).

So its not like she has to travel from home to City A for daughter's event, then to City B for son's event and then back home- she literally has a single leg trip from home to daughter's event and back home.
