I called her saying that I'll accept the invite on one condition and that is to make sure that my vegan boyfriend m25 is accommodated. She asked what that meant and I sent her a list of options to cook for him since he can't be having any meals that contain meat and the main dish at thanksgiving is *obviously* meat. She got back to me later calling ridiculous for expecting her to cook an \"elaborate\" meal for my boyfriend. I told her I was just making sure he'll have something to eat when the time comes but she turned it back on me asking why don't I choose a meal from the list I sent her and cook it for him myself and bring it. This was a hard no from because for one, she's the host. And besides that I'm busy with school and she should consider how I sacrificed my study time to come celebrate thanksgiving with her and the family. She said that I was out of line and hung up. Dad called me and was furious sayin he could not believe this \"attitude\" I'm giving about the whole thing but I said that I was just making sure that my boyfriend *who's a guest* at their event, is accomodated that's all. We had an argument and he hung up upon telling me to get over myself.\n\n\nWe haven't talked after that. My siblings want me to attend but mom thinks it's unfair what I'm asking of her.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\nADD: My boyfriend didn't think that bringing a meal would be appropriate, he thought my parents might see it as \"disrespectful\".\n\nSecond of all, My parents are fine with me not contributing to thanksgiving they just wanted me to attend and so do my siblings. I can choose not go if I could but then my parents will think I'm punishing them or something. They will think that I'm holding my presence at the event over their head.", "created_utc": 1668205665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysp5fn/aita_for_expecting_accommodation_for_my_vegan/", "score": 1609, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You presumably eat on regular days when you\u2019re not being fed by your mother, don\u2019t you? Well. Same difference. Make it the night before . Or get off Reddit and make it now, and freeze it.\nYour attitude about \u2018sacrificing your time\u2019 is atrocious. What an ugly way to view your family, like it\u2019s a sacrifice to go see them. If you were my family, I\u2019d tell you to not bother, if I\u2019m honest.", "God, what an entitled AH.", "INFO: What\u2019s an example from the list of options you sent your mom? And was your intention that she make one of the options, not multiple?", "YTA.   Nowhere do you state that this is a medical accommodation that you're requesting.  So what you're asking for is something tied to lifestyle which, under normal conditions, merits consideration.  But this is Thanksgiving when a whole array of traditional dishes get prepared.   In this case, I agree with your mother. You and/or your boyfriend should prepare the dish(es) that he'll eat. And bring them with you.\n\nWhere you come off as completely entitled is your claim that you're sacrificing study time to even go and participate in Thanksgiving dinner.  That's why I have minimal to no sympathy for you. As far as I am concerned,  it may be time for you and your boyfriend to consider starting your own personal holiday traditions: prepar and eat your own Thanksgiving dinner at home!\n\n Or, ask his family to host you. For some reason,  I doubt that they'd be very sympathetic either.", "JFC you suck. And if that didn't translate for you, that also means YTA.", "Going against the grain here, NTA. Your mother should not have extended the invitation to your boyfriend if she was not willing to accommodate his diet. It\u2019s common courtesy when hosting an event, so people are not excluded/left out. If you aren\u2019t prepared for the extra work, fine but don\u2019t invite them in the first place.\n\nHowever, if you see this as a relationship that will last; you should offer an alternative compromise to your mom: prepare some vegan dishes together. You spend quality time with your mom, she gains experience cooking vegan dishes/alternatives(a plus if your bf becomes your husband), and your family gets the opportunity to see that vegan versions of dishes can be just as tasty. (FYI I am not a vegan, doesn\u2019t mean a well prepared vegan dish isn\u2019t delicious).", "YTA. If someone has a very difficult lifestyle choice, such as veganism, they should accommodate themselves.  Tell your boyfriend to cook his vegan food and pack it up to bring it with him. This way he can accommodate his own choices while enjoying a holiday meal with your family.", "YTA. Your mother is right. If he needs special food you should make it and bring it. Cooking Thanksgiving is a huge undertaking, and asking her to cook two meals is unreasonable and entitled.", "YTA. Your boyfriend is your responsibility and if your mum said you can cook something for him that should have been cool. You are requesting her something and she is denying it, simple as that. It would be nice if she did it but if not that should be fine. She must be busy as heck already and you want her to make a special dish for your boyfriend and when refused you are acting all entitled and making a fuss. \n\nThis could all be resolved nicely if you just cook something for your boyfriend or heck you can even do takeaways or something.", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s a terrible way to treat your parents so rude and disrespectful. Most Thanksgiving meals have plenty of sides that aren\u2019t meat. It\u2019s also VERY normal for people to being a dish. My parents loved it when I brought stuffing/dressing and would go on about how good it was. This is actually a great opportunity to show off your cooking skills to your parents and your boyfriend. I was so proud of my daughter for not just coming over but helping me cook everything. It proved to me that I taught her well and I know she will always have the ability to have her own thanksgivings for years to come. \n\nBut my daughter moved to another state. I\u2019m barely scraping by as to get a plane ticket for either one of us to visit. My stepfather died. (He loved coming to my place to eat too) and mom has Alzheimer\u2019s and in a nursing home. So I will be alone For thanksgiving this year. But that\u2019s okay because I had so many good one with my friends and family over the years. So don\u2019t miss out on that. Thanksgiving is about spending time together and doing things for each other. I bet your parents always provided the holiday meals because most do. When my parents started getting older, I just had them come to my place so that they didn\u2019t have to do all that anymore after doing my entire life.", "Why aren't YOU bringing food? In our family, everyone brings something. \n\nYou aren't \"sacrificing\" your studies, kiddo. Your mother is kind enough to make food for the whole family, that includes you.\n\nYta", "I've been the vegetarian at large gatherings before, and unless your suggestions consisted of \"leave the butter out of some of the mashed potatoes\" and \"put some of the roasted veggies aside before topping them with gravy\" (which I doubt, otherwise you would have mentioned how reasonable and minor the accommodations were), YTA. I remember one lovely Christmas where I visited a friend's family and ate almost nothing but baked yams and Brussel sprouts, and I loved it because they were delicious and the family was so kind to me.\n\nAs the one person with special food needs at a large gathering, it's generally incumbent upon the vegetarian to be as little bother as possible to the host. Yes it's annoying when we get there and absolutely nothing is edible, but you also can't expect to have as much variety to choose from as everyone else. You make do and enjoy the company.\n\nDo you think your sacrifice of some time away from studying is somehow greater than the sacrifice of time your mother will be putting into this entire meal for a large gathering? Because I can assure you, taking a short time away from your studies is not an unprecedented sacrifice that deserves special accommodation in itself.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do would be to say \"here are ways to make a meal he can eat out of parts of what you're making already\", and if you really want him to have a main, either make something yourself or buy a small turkey substitute just for him. It is not reasonable to expect an entire parallel meal to be cooked for just one person, which is what your post implies you wanted done.\n\nAgain, YTA.", "Yta. Your mom shouldn\u2019t be accommodating him. You and your bf should be bringing food for him", "You need to be a problem solver, you are an adult now. don\u2019t expect your mother to figure everything out. You tell her exactly what you need why it\u2019s reasonable and how you will contribute to resolving it.", "YTA. Wow, the entitlement. You really don't get the spirit of this holiday.\n\nI think it would have been fine to ask your mom if she could adjust one dish for your BF (i.e., set some mashed potatoes aside before adding butter), but not to ask her to make another complete meal. \n\nIf you go, you should bring something that's vegan to share. You owe your mom an apology.", "YTA. Anyone with special dietary restrictions - especially chosen ones and not life threatening - needs to take care of their own needs. Having vegan options that aren't just plain veggies is a total pain in the ass to add in during an already difficult meal since it's checking every component of each ingredient as well. It's also expensive! Now if you all were married many years and your family had been refusing forever I'd be saying yeah, they're assholes, but for a first time boyfriend and with the dinner only a couple of weeks away? Nah... cook it yourself. Or let BF cook for himself.", "YTA.\n\nI might say differently if this was your hubby, but when you have special dietary needs you sort that out for yourself instead of expecting others to do it for you.", "YTA. Because she said YOU could make his dish and bring it. She doesnt want to cook it and offered a compromise. She didn't say he couldn't have food he eat, she just said she wasn't going the extra mile. Which is understandable if she has already bought everything for a traditional thanksgiving.  you suddenly throw an additional dish that she would have to shop for, learn how to make, and have to grant additional time on is a dick move. Can he not have any of the side dishes? Not every dish contains meat", "YTA. When eating preferences are a choice and not a necessity (allergy), bring your own meals. You are pretty entitled if you don't realize how much effort already goes into a thanksgiving dinner, not to mention cost.

You are quite entitled to turn it down.", "I am a vegetarian and a person who likes to cook.

In my experience if there are things people will or will not eat they bring stuff themselves. You're 24 but you act like a child still.", "YTA. You're bringing a guest who needs a special diet, so it's up to you to provide food for him. Your mom is already making an elaborate meal for everyone she invited. If you want to invite someone who can't eat what is being served, it is incredibly entitled and thoughtless to tell your mom she needs to make one of the dishes you specified on top of making everything else. You're an adult so stop acting like it's your mom's job to cater to whatever you want.\nI don't eat seafood so when my aunt makes her traditional Christmas eve dinner of fish, my cousin and I who don't like fish make a chicken dish to take to the party so there's something for us to eat.

Yes he may be a guest but not sure why he can\u2019t eat a side?", "YTA. Accommodating is completely different from making a completely separate meal for your vegan boyfriend.

You're literally trying to force her to cook a whole separate meal for one person while she's preparing probably the biggest meal for the most people she'll make all year, and you cannot help and you chock the whole thing up to courtesy because \"guest\". \n\nNow, I'm betting there's some likely compromises that could be made if everyone were being creative and willing to chip in. Don't add bacon to the green beans, when making the stuffing, could you use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth... and so forth and then maybe it just ends up being one meatless protein dish that has to be added.  AND you HELP. Now, that's accommodation AND compromise. So, call her back, apologize and offer to compromise on a few things and see if the temperature of this whole thing can get lowered a bit.

For the Turkey and gravy, you could offer to buy an off the shelf alternative for vegans, some Tofurkey or whatever he likes--in fact ask HIM what he wants for the main course. Ask your Mom about the salad and see if any non vegan items can be left on the side so people can add them in as they like-such as cheese, croutons, dressing, bacon bits, whatever.

Usually the host makes the turkey, stuffing, and maybe mashed potatoes in my experience. Hell, I\u2019m hosting Friendsgiving this year and I\u2019m not even making the turkeys. Like, twenty people are likely coming and every one of them is bringing food or drinks", "It\u2019s funny op doesn\u2019t see it. The only thing she is contributing is her presence. Mentioned she\u2019s sacrificing study time to see her family. Hilarious", "Yes, not in the spirit of thanksgiving is it!", "Right?? Like sure, maybe the mom could incorporate a side dish or something that is vegan, but there is no reason OP shouldn\u2019t be preparing/bringing food her boyfriend can eat. In our family, everyone brings something. It\u2019s so much stress for the host to do everything!!", "OP is giving off all the r/IAmTheMainCharacter vibes! \nYTA op. Your parents may be hosting thanksgiving, but your boyfriend is YOUR guest. YOU invited him! So YOU can worry about accommodating his diet. Luckily, you already have the list of vegan recipes that you sent your mom. If you thought it\u2019d be so simple for HER to whip up all of those vegan recipes, then I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be just as simple for you.", "If she\u2019s normally like this I\u2019m surprised she got invited at all. Then \u201conly accepting the invite on one condition\u201d? Like does she even like her family? Guy is already off to a rough start in regards to first impressions too, as he seems a bit entitled too\u2026", "Theres a very nice \" turkey\"\" stuffed with cranberries single serve meal available. Which is totally would be for my brother the vegan. Its super easy to make. However he would bring a dish anyway because he is an actual chef. For one of the sides I also serve up this stuffed squash with wild and brown rice, use some \" not chicken\" cubes making it and add some garbanzo beans. Its so good I make plenty because the vegetarians and non vegetarianss in the family appreciate it too.  I make mushroom gravy with creamy cashew milk. We are having a family reunion this year and everybody is getting enlisted to get this shindig together. You don't cook? Here's the potato peeler. Get busy", "100%! I\u2019ve always been a picky eater - but mostly, I just don\u2019t seem to like a lot of the typical western holiday foods. \n\nMy holiday meals growing up were typically buns, cranberry sauce, and maybe a few vegetables depending on what was made. And then dessert. The typical meats (Turkey and ham) I despise. I don\u2019t like stuffing. I\u2019m not a big fan of mashed potatoes. I hate cooked peas and I don\u2019t like cooked carrots (I do like candied roasted ones but that isn\u2019t as common).\n\nI never complain at holiday meals. I just eat what there is and happily fill up on pumpkin pie once that\u2019s allowed!", "Yes! If OP were just asking her mom to leave some of the mashed potatoes out before adding butter and cream, and keep some of the vegetables without butter for him, even to use vegetable stock in the dressing and keep some butter-free, that would be understandable. But to ask her to make an entire menu of specialty vegan dishes is incredibly presumptuous. You can tell OP has never cooked a Thanksgiving dinner.", "OP please don\u2019t burden yourself with attending thanksgiving this year. Since you\u2019re so busy with your life. Showing up and eating is definitely more effort than making a meal yourself, especially when your time is so valuable. I\u2019m sure your mom has just been sitting around doing nothing and preparing this meal for you is the only thing going on in her life right now. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s busy or has a life or maybe finds cooking a giant feast for a big crowd of people to be challenging in any way. She obviously is refusing to add on special dishes she\u2019s never made before and has to go search out special ingredients for as a way to insult your boyfriend. Not because she\u2019s busy, or has a life completely separate from her role as your mother, or gets stressed out making new and untested recipes under pressure. \n\nObviously this is sarcasm OP. Everyone else here knows that but I have a feeling you could miss it.", "Not just that, but if those \"approved meals\" that OP sent had ingredients mom isn't accustomed to using, it could take even longer.  I couldn't imagine trying to figure out how to cook with tofu or vegan butter or vegan cheese while trying to manage ALL the other dishes at Thanksgiving.  I know exactly how long it takes to make the mashed potatoes I make, and the rolls I make, and the green beans I make and no one better mess with that!", "Yep! I\u2019ve been a strict vegetarian since I was 14 but I would never expect someone hosting me for a meal to cater to me by making something separate. I almost always bring my own meal and heat it up there unless I know in advance that there will definitely be something I can eat. I\u2019m responsible for my personal dietary preferences and proceed accordingly. OP is definitely TA here.", "She doesn't. She's acting like she'd be studying in her dorm or apartment if she wasn't going to see her family.", "YTA I have Celiac Disease and my mom and I work TOGETHER to accommodate my needs. In my case this means: the stuffing, regular and gluten free is not cooked in the turkey, gluten free seasonings are used on the turkey, I make my stuffing and a dessert, etc.", "Or, OP can let bf know that mom is open to food being brought for bf to eat. That way bf can make and bring his own safe meal.", "I\u2019m a northerner and I would feel naked if I didn\u2019t have something in my hand when I arrived.", "Not a southern thing, we're Canadian, our Thanksgiving happened last month and you bet your last hockey puck we all contributed to the meal!\n\nPlus think what a fun introduction to the family event it is for you guys to bring one of his favourite dishes, maybe it will become a new family favourite. \n\nHonestly I was happy to contribute when I was in university it was like a right of passage, you're not a child anymore\nWhen you can pitch in even if it's just an appetizer or salad.  \n\nPlease stop and think of your mother as a person, if it takes you so long to make one dish that you think it's unbearable, multiply that by everything you expect to see at your thanksgiving dinner.  That's what your mother is already committed to. She just can't physically make anything else especially not a main course.  \n\nHappy thanks giving to \"y'all\"!", "Lmao that comment. She acts like the family is just getting together to see her. Not celebrating the holiday or anything. Oh nooo we all gather aroundthis meal because OP has graced us with her presence. We waited all year for her to have this moment where she was not busy for school to see her and her vegan man", "If I was mom in this situation, her and boyfriend's invites would be rescinded.\n\nYTA!", "Like the OP would MUCH rather be studying than relaxing and eating a big home cooked meal with her family on a national holiday.  It\u2019s such a sacrifice!", "Nevermind the fact that most universities in the US are on break during the holidays!", "Agreed. Demanding mom make a whole other meal for her plus 1 is a bit overstep and makes OP sound entitled.", "In my head reading her elaborate reasons, I was thinking, is her boyfriend Jesus??", "She's still her when she's hungry tho \ud83d\ude2d", "Agreed. N T A for asking if they can make a vegan dish or put stuff aside, but the way OP comes off is pure entitlement. Sounds like OP needs to stay home and study instead of gracing them with their presence.\n\nYTA", "Omg that's the 1st thing that got me!! The Queen of Thanksgiving over here. Sheesh", "I would suggest that people with allergies / intolerance also BYO a lot of the time as there is no way to know exactly what is in it otherwise.", "I doubt he's vegan.\n\nIf he is, then she clearly has never made him a meal or she would know that vegans abstain from more than meat.", "The entitlement is horrible lol \n\nMost thanksgivings have a potluck style. That was a perfect opportunity for them to make their favorite vegan dish and share it with the rest of the family. Instead they made crazy demands and created drama. I'd bet my lunch money it's a phase that they're a month into, and they try to act like the superior vegans lol", "Well exactly. When mom said what does accommodating mean, she could\u2019ve said \u2018oh could you set aside a serving of cooked potatoes before you add the butter\u2019 or \u2018could the salad have a vinaigrette instead of ranch\u2019 and then \u2018that combined with the cranberry wild rice stuffing I\u2019m bringing will mean he can have a full plate\u2019. \n\nLike there is a lot of options here other than \u2018here\u2019s a list of extra stand alone dishes\u2019", "Right?! I\u2019m vegetarian and I would feel so incredibly uncomfortable if I knew I was the reason behind these outlandish demands. I\u2019m already uncomfortable when family members get concerned/disappointed when I arrive and say I can\u2019t eat 98 percent of the meal and fret about trying to figure out more for me to eat\u2026.", "Seriously I was just saying the same thing out loud (don\u2019t worry, my kids already know I\u2019m weird lol \ud83d\ude02)\n\nWhat an entitled AH and no lie, her entire post screams the entitlement\u2026", "Seriously, this is why people don\u2019t respect the vegan choice. Turn down the attitude lady.", "This.  I eat plant based and it\u2019s way too much for me to be in the kitchen while my mom is cooking but I also don\u2019t expect her to accommodate me the 1 out of 18 people.  So I order the Whole Foods meal for 2 every year and it\u2019s pretty tasty.  It\u2019s not that expensive and it\u2019s got tons of food.  And way more satisfying than a non vegan attempting to cook a vegan dish for the first timeZ", "Yeah, I think OP and her boyfriend are missing out on a great opportunity to introduce the family to actually good vegan cuisine.  Also if the family has never met the boyfriend before, this is probably a really bad start.  You don't show up to a holiday meal with demands.", "Guests should be invited lol. Hey mom im inviting this dude so I\u2019ll make sure to bring something for him", "I'm wondering if OP even actually discussed this with BF before demanding things. \n\nAs one commenter said, it's one thing to ask if butter could be substituted with vegan block for all the veggie sides.....its another thing to demand a completely different, additional meal.\n\nBut, honestly, as someone with dietary restrictions I, a) don't think that I should push them onto my host, but more importantly b) don't always trust that someone else will follow or fully understand my restrictions...so its on ME to handle that.... and I don't mind.\n\nIt's funny that OP says that BF said he thought it would be rude to bring his own dish....why wasn't that the question posed to Mom...instead of a demand to make an entirely different additional meal?", "Stuffing usually gets some meat juice or stock on it as well as having butter involved. It's possible to make vegan versions (just like with mashed potatoes etc), but they're not the default way most people make them. It's entirely possible that there might be nothing vegan at the table usually. \n\nThe bf seems willing to bring his own food if it's not going to be perceived as rude by the hosts though so it's not clear why OP doesn't just let him do that. So YTA for OP.", "Less of a YTA situation and more of a LOL one\u2026 how can she type this out and think she\u2019s in the right. Her poor mum!", "When you're cooking an elaborate meal for a big family and their guests you can't \"accommodate\" everyone. If you try someone is going to get left out, feelings are going to get hurt, arguments are going to happen. It's  best to just cook your traditional meal and let people eat the things they want and leave the things they don't.", "She gave her mom a list, and it sounded to me like she expected her mom to make more than one thing, hence the \"elaborate second meal\" comment and the \"make a meal to bring for him\" thing.", "Within the OP's self centered me diatribe, she makes it clear that her mom did not know the BF was a vegan nor did she even know what a vegan is.  Her mom not knowing what a vegan is,  prompted her to send her mom a list of MEALS for her to make.", "Oh absolutely pressing meat on a vegan/vegetarian is an asshole thing to do. \n\nI've had vegans come to dinner and I've accommodated by making sure the green beans are vegan, reserving some of the squash soup before finishing with cream, then offering to make one of those frozen tofurkey things. \n\nFor anything else, they are bringing it themselves. But I promise I would never pressure them to eat something they don't want to.", "yeah I\u2019m vegan and I almost always try to bring a dish when someone is hosting so that they don\u2019t have to worry about me.

She always makes sure those with allergies/vego can eat a suitable amount. The year her sister went vegan and she simply ensured all the sides would be vegan. (Eg not covering the veg in butter, found a nice vegan potato bake thing). Her sister then brought a vegan main to share alongside the meat main.\n\nIt was no fuss. No one was offended. The food was great.\n\nI think YTA giving a heads up to your host so they don\u2019t put dairy on every dish is fine, but then refusing to contribute when asked  is an arsehole move.", "And the boyfriend is ok with it, as long as he\u2019s sure that OPs mother won\u2019t get offended because he brings his own food.", "Given that the host suggested they do it, I agree it's absolutely fine they bring their own", "I hope your Nanna laughed like hell because that is hilarious.

Isn't that enough? /s", "I agree with every single word.", "I have food allergies. The only accomodations I ask for are to be told ingredients and allowed to go first. I've also told people that if I don't get a lot to eat, I'll get something myself after we've had a good time.", "This, OP sounds like a teenager and it\u2019s pissing me off. The stress of having to cook for the whole family is huge and she can\u2019t even cook something for her bf OR his bf could cook something himself if she doesn\u2019t want to sacrifice more of her precious study time. Or maybe he could simply go and spend thanksgiving with his family if his mom is used to cook something else for him. People that expect everyone else to fix their problems make me so mad.", "Only if she didn't have to sacrifice her valuable study time. Which is more valuable than other people's time. Even if these other people study too.", "Sounds like my mom. She always treated both Thanksgiving and Xmas like an opportunity to eat several main dishes. Since she liked the traditional turkey, we had to have that along with all the traditional sides and pumpkin pie. But she also thought it was a good time to make the Korean dishes that are elaborate and require more work. After the meal, she\u2019d freeze most of the leftover turkey and we still had leftovers in the refrigerator for days.", "But she is, she's giving up her study time to come celebrate with them.

I don\u2019t blame mom for saying no!", "Ehh\u2026I think OP being in charge of the dish is fair. \n\nBf is a stranger and doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat or offend anyone. \n\nOP is the child of the host and more familiar with the family and the dynamics. Anything OP does is more likely to be accepted than the stranger. \n\nOP takes the lead on this since it\u2019s OPs family. Seems like that may be more comfortable for everyone.", "Um, she would be her bf\u2019s \u201chost\u201d since she\u2019s inviting him.

Him making it would be a hard no since she's the host in that regard.", "Honestly they should each be taking a dish", "This really is the best idea because they probably hate him now because of her attitude.", "And don\u201dt mr Loverboy have arms to cook with?

Easy peasy.", "IMO, it's appropriate to expect either basic accommodations OR a sincere invite to bring what works for a guest with special dietary needs.  We deal with this for my SIL who is allergic to gluten, egg, and soy.\n\nAccommodations can be simple.  Canned green beans are vegan.  Plain salad is vegan.
