I called her saying that I'll accept the invite on one condition and that is to make sure that my vegan boyfriend m25 is accommodated. She asked what that meant and I sent her a list of options to cook for him since he can't be having any meals that contain meat and the main dish at thanksgiving is *obviously* meat. She got back to me later calling ridiculous for expecting her to cook an \"elaborate\" meal for my boyfriend. I told her I was just making sure he'll have something to eat when the time comes but she turned it back on me asking why don't I choose a meal from the list I sent her and cook it for him myself and bring it. This was a hard no from because for one, she's the host. And besides that I'm busy with school and she should consider how I sacrificed my study time to come celebrate thanksgiving with her and the family. She said that I was out of line and hung up. Dad called me and was furious sayin he could not believe this \"attitude\" I'm giving about the whole thing but I said that I was just making sure that my boyfriend *who's a guest* at their event, is accomodated that's all. We had an argument and he hung up upon telling me to get over myself.\n\n\nWe haven't talked after that. My siblings want me to attend but mom thinks it's unfair what I'm asking of her.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\nADD: My boyfriend didn't think that bringing a meal would be appropriate, he thought my parents might see it as \"disrespectful\".\n\nSecond of all, My parents are fine with me not contributing to thanksgiving they just wanted me to attend and so do my siblings. I can choose not go if I could but then my parents will think I'm punishing them or something. They will think that I'm holding my presence at the event over their head.", "created_utc": 1668205665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysp5fn/aita_for_expecting_accommodation_for_my_vegan/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You presumably eat on regular days when you\u2019re not being fed by your mother, don\u2019t you? Well. Same difference. Make it the night before . Or get off Reddit and make it now, and freeze it.\nYour attitude about \u2018sacrificing your time\u2019 is atrocious. What an ugly way to view your family, like it\u2019s a sacrifice to go see them. If you were my family, I\u2019d tell you to not bother, if I\u2019m honest.", "God, what an entitled AH.", "INFO: What\u2019s an example from the list of options you sent your mom? And was your intention that she make one of the options, not multiple?", "YTA.   Nowhere do you state that this is a medical accommodation that you're requesting.  So what you're asking for is something tied to lifestyle which, under normal conditions, merits consideration.  But this is Thanksgiving when a whole array of traditional dishes get prepared.   In this case, I agree with your mother. You and/or your boyfriend should prepare the dish(es) that he'll eat. And bring them with you.\n\nWhere you come off as completely entitled is your claim that you're sacrificing study time to even go and participate in Thanksgiving dinner.  That's why I have minimal to no sympathy for you. As far as I am concerned,  it may be time for you and your boyfriend to consider starting your own personal holiday traditions: prepar and eat your own Thanksgiving dinner at home!\n\n Or, ask his family to host you. For some reason,  I doubt that they'd be very sympathetic either.", "JFC you suck. And if that didn't translate for you, that also means YTA.", "Going against the grain here, NTA. Your mother should not have extended the invitation to your boyfriend if she was not willing to accommodate his diet. It\u2019s common courtesy when hosting an event, so people are not excluded/left out. If you aren\u2019t prepared for the extra work, fine but don\u2019t invite them in the first place.\n\nHowever, if you see this as a relationship that will last; you should offer an alternative compromise to your mom: prepare some vegan dishes together. You spend quality time with your mom, she gains experience cooking vegan dishes/alternatives(a plus if your bf becomes your husband), and your family gets the opportunity to see that vegan versions of dishes can be just as tasty. (FYI I am not a vegan, doesn\u2019t mean a well prepared vegan dish isn\u2019t delicious).", "YTA. If someone has a very difficult lifestyle choice, such as veganism, they should accommodate themselves.  Tell your boyfriend to cook his vegan food and pack it up to bring it with him. This way he can accommodate his own choices while enjoying a holiday meal with your family.", "YTA. Your mother is right. If he needs special food you should make it and bring it. Cooking Thanksgiving is a huge undertaking, and asking her to cook two meals is unreasonable and entitled.", "YTA. Your boyfriend is your responsibility and if your mum said you can cook something for him that should have been cool. You are requesting her something and she is denying it, simple as that. It would be nice if she did it but if not that should be fine. She must be busy as heck already and you want her to make a special dish for your boyfriend and when refused you are acting all entitled and making a fuss. \n\nThis could all be resolved nicely if you just cook something for your boyfriend or heck you can even do takeaways or something.", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s a terrible way to treat your parents so rude and disrespectful. Most Thanksgiving meals have plenty of sides that aren\u2019t meat. It\u2019s also VERY normal for people to being a dish. My parents loved it when I brought stuffing/dressing and would go on about how good it was. This is actually a great opportunity to show off your cooking skills to your parents and your boyfriend. I was so proud of my daughter for not just coming over but helping me cook everything. It proved to me that I taught her well and I know she will always have the ability to have her own thanksgivings for years to come. \n\nBut my daughter moved to another state. I\u2019m barely scraping by as to get a plane ticket for either one of us to visit. My stepfather died. (He loved coming to my place to eat too) and mom has Alzheimer\u2019s and in a nursing home. So I will be alone For thanksgiving this year. But that\u2019s okay because I had so many good one with my friends and family over the years. So don\u2019t miss out on that. Thanksgiving is about spending time together and doing things for each other. I bet your parents always provided the holiday meals because most do. When my parents started getting older, I just had them come to my place so that they didn\u2019t have to do all that anymore after doing my entire life.", "Why aren't YOU bringing food? In our family, everyone brings something. \n\nYou aren't \"sacrificing\" your studies, kiddo. Your mother is kind enough to make food for the whole family, that includes you.\n\nYta", "I've been the vegetarian at large gatherings before, and unless your suggestions consisted of \"leave the butter out of some of the mashed potatoes\" and \"put some of the roasted veggies aside before topping them with gravy\" (which I doubt, otherwise you would have mentioned how reasonable and minor the accommodations were), YTA. I remember one lovely Christmas where I visited a friend's family and ate almost nothing but baked yams and Brussel sprouts, and I loved it because they were delicious and the family was so kind to me.\n\nAs the one person with special food needs at a large gathering, it's generally incumbent upon the vegetarian to be as little bother as possible to the host. Yes it's annoying when we get there and absolutely nothing is edible, but you also can't expect to have as much variety to choose from as everyone else. You make do and enjoy the company.\n\nDo you think your sacrifice of some time away from studying is somehow greater than the sacrifice of time your mother will be putting into this entire meal for a large gathering? Because I can assure you, taking a short time away from your studies is not an unprecedented sacrifice that deserves special accommodation in itself.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do would be to say \"here are ways to make a meal he can eat out of parts of what you're making already\", and if you really want him to have a main, either make something yourself or buy a small turkey substitute just for him. It is not reasonable to expect an entire parallel meal to be cooked for just one person, which is what your post implies you wanted done.\n\nAgain, YTA.", "Yta. Your mom shouldn\u2019t be accommodating him. You and your bf should be bringing food for him", "You need to be a problem solver, you are an adult now. don\u2019t expect your mother to figure everything out. You tell her exactly what you need why it\u2019s reasonable and how you will contribute to resolving it.", "YTA. Wow, the entitlement. You really don't get the spirit of this holiday.\n\nI think it would have been fine to ask your mom if she could adjust one dish for your BF (i.e., set some mashed potatoes aside before adding butter), but not to ask her to make another complete meal. \n\nIf you go, you should bring something that's vegan to share. You owe your mom an apology.", "YTA. Anyone with special dietary restrictions - especially chosen ones and not life threatening - needs to take care of their own needs. Having vegan options that aren't just plain veggies is a total pain in the ass to add in during an already difficult meal since it's checking every component of each ingredient as well. It's also expensive! Now if you all were married many years and your family had been refusing forever I'd be saying yeah, they're assholes, but for a first time boyfriend and with the dinner only a couple of weeks away? Nah... cook it yourself. Or let BF cook for himself.", "YTA.\n\nI might say differently if this was your hubby, but when you have special dietary needs you sort that out for yourself instead of expecting others to do it for you.", "YTA. Because she said YOU could make his dish and bring it. She doesnt want to cook it and offered a compromise. She didn't say he couldn't have food he eat, she just said she wasn't going the extra mile. Which is understandable if she has already bought everything for a traditional thanksgiving.  you suddenly throw an additional dish that she would have to shop for, learn how to make, and have to grant additional time on is a dick move. Can he not have any of the side dishes? Not every dish contains meat", "YTA. When eating preferences are a choice and not a necessity (allergy), bring your own meals. You are pretty entitled if you don't realize how much effort already goes into a thanksgiving dinner, not to mention cost.

You are quite entitled to turn it down.", "I am a vegetarian and a person who likes to cook.

You're bringing a guest who needs a special diet, so it's up to you to provide food for him. Your mom is already making an elaborate meal for everyone she invited. If you want to invite someone who can't eat what is being served, it is incredibly entitled and thoughtless to tell your mom she needs to make one of the dishes you specified on top of making everything else. You're an adult so stop acting like it's your mom's job to cater to whatever you want.\nI don't eat seafood so when my aunt makes her traditional Christmas eve dinner of fish, my cousin and I who don't like fish make a chicken dish to take to the party so there's something for us to eat.

Yes he may be a guest but not sure why he can\u2019t eat a side?", "YTA. Accommodating is completely different from making a completely separate meal for your vegan boyfriend.

You're literally trying to force her to cook a whole separate meal for one person while she's preparing probably the biggest meal for the most people she'll make all year, and you cannot help and you chock the whole thing up to courtesy because \"guest\". \n\nNow, I'm betting there's some likely compromises that could be made if everyone were being creative and willing to chip in. Don't add bacon to the green beans, when making the stuffing, could you use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth... and so forth and then maybe it just ends up being one meatless protein dish that has to be added.  AND you HELP. Now, that's accommodation AND compromise. So, call her back, apologize and offer to compromise on a few things and see if the temperature of this whole thing can get lowered a bit.

For the Turkey and gravy, you could offer to buy an off the shelf alternative for vegans, some Tofurkey or whatever he likes--in fact ask HIM what he wants for the main course. Ask your Mom about the salad and see if any non vegan items can be left on the side so people can add them in as they like-such as cheese, croutons, dressing, bacon bits, whatever.
