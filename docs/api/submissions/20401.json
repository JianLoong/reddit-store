It's a tradition among my frnds to watch a movie , with everyone paying for their own tickets. I selected the movie, collected the money from my friends, and booked the tickets. I paid for the food\n\nSince it was vacation, some of our friends were out . I asked my  brother (14m) if he wanted to join, and he was thrilled. He requested if he could invite a couple friends, and since I knew them, I agreed (they paid for the movie and I for the food). We were 12 PPL in total . I also used my movie credits to upgrade our seats to a better seat\n\nAfter getting food from a fast food place , we started playing truth or dare, although nothing extreme or inappropriate. We have a rule that anything discussed during game should not be shared with anyone . I made it clear to my brother's friends multiple times not to disclose anything , it was their first time playing with us. My brother was familiar with the rules since he had played with us before\n\nThe truth or dare game started off with typical questions about crushes,  situations, and funny dares like making reels or something similar. When it was my turn, I chose dare, and my friend challenged me to reveal one of my brother's secrets only we knew. I asked my brother beforehand if he was okay with me sharing this one secret, and he agreed since it was just a small group of ppl\n\nThe secret wasn't anything serious; it was about my brother developing a crush on a girl he saw at our uncle's wedding nd discovered later that she was our new aunt's sister and 27 years old. It was funny and we all had a good laugh. We continued playing truth or dare for about 30 minutes and then headed home\n\n4 days later, on Tuesday, my brother called me to inform that some parts of our game were shared in some groups, resulting in him being mocked for having attraction to older women. Our moms were unaware of this incident. He shared a 12-minute video with me that was recorded by someone using a phone hidden in their pocket. I noticed it was a phone belonging to one of my brother's classmates ( while stopping video his ring was noticable in videos ), who wasn't particularly close to him but had similar interests .\n\nI decided to speak with the school supervisor on Tuesday evening. I explained the situation and showed her the video and  pictures. After reviewing the evidence, the supervisor called the parents of that student  and suspend him for 2 weeks for participating in cyberbullying. Note - the video contained no inappropriate content ,mainly light jokes . Supervisor also contacted my brother's mom and explained the situation to her. She understood and was fine with the truth or dare game, as it was nothing inappropriate\n\nHowever, some of my friends (not my close frnds) mocked me, calling me an AH for getting the student suspended and overreacting . I am feeling guilty and questioning whether I should have just requested a warning .

The suspension was appropriate and this was the adult thing to do.", "NTA\n\nBullying is not cool, two weeks for having committed cyberbullying + recording other people without their prior consent + knowing not to say anything, was too little punishment in my opinion, I'm happy to see that there are stories where the bully doesn't have a happy ending.\n\nAnd please tell your brother and the rest of his friends to stay away from this kid, real friends don't cyberbully behind his back, forgiving a bully most of the time doesn't make him a better person, it just teaches him what he should be more discreet with his crimes. So I don't recommend giving him a second chance.\n\nNote: in case anyone found it strange that I said \"crime\", it's just that in my country this shit of bullying and cyberbullying is a crime, I don't know if this applies to you or other users, so I decided to leave this note.", "[deleted]", "Teenagers???", "A video going out recording people\u2019s vulnerability and putting them out into the world isn\u2019t a harm-free act.", "Everything is a harmful act these days.", "Acting with malicious intent has always been harmful.", "I just said everything is harmful.", "Acting without malicious intent is remarkable harm free.
