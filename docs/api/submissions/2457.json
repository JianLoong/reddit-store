A couple weeks ago after two weeks straight of 8/9:00 days my wife asked me if I was doing ok with this and said maybe I should talk to my boss about the frequency of the late nights, (we\u2019re short people right now) I told her I was fine with the OT money and I\u2019d rather keep working them knowing that if I need out on time any day I just have to tell them and it\u2019s not a problem, they schedule me a lighter day. \n\nMy wife\u2019s (39f) birthday was last week. I took her out for dinner on Saturday and our kids and I made her dinner Sunday. The morning of her birthday I told her I had a job that would probably mean a late night. She got upset that I hadn\u2019t told my boss I needed to leave on time that day since it was her birthday, bringing up the specific conversation about how I said I could ask for that any time I needed. I said that taking her to dinner and making her dinner over the weekend was all I planned to do and I didn\u2019t think I needed to leave on time that day. Usually the kids have activities at night and she\u2019s not home anyway. It ended up that I got home at 6:30 but by then she had already left to take our 4 kids out for dinner. \n\nAdditional info before it\u2019s asked- she also works full time and since she\u2019s home she is the one who makes dinner and runs the kids to their activities, I help with that the days I\u2019m home on time \n\nShe says I hurt her feelings by not doing a simple thing to prioritize her actual birthday I said she\u2019s overreacting because I already did something days before.

Per your other comment, \u201cshe\u2019s been telling me lately she feels unappreciated and overwhelmed\u201d. And yet you prioritize working overtime, so that she continues to feel unappreciated and overwhelmed while you work long hours and she works and takes care of the kids and doesn\u2019t get to spend time with her husband. Did you ask your wife how she wanted to spend her birthday, or did you assume you could celebrate on the weekend and that\u2019s enough because \u201cyou have to work late\u201d (when though you don\u2019t\u2014as you said, you can ask for a light day)? Your wife has communicated that you\u2019re working too much; she may have not done it clearly, because she put the ball in your court to acknowledge you\u2019re working too much rather than coming out and saying that she wants you to work less and be home more, but the message is there. You just have to listen.", "YTA, she telling you that she feels unappreciated and overwhelmed and you don't make her a priority for one single day and give her the day off.  You are not present in your marriage and it will fail if you don't change directions.", "YTA. With regard to her birthday, this sounds like miscommunication on both your parts. \n\nHowever: with regard to, I \u201chelp with that [all the evening child care & taking the kids to activities] the days I\u2019m home on time\u201d, you are definitely an AH. Saying that you \u201chelp\u201d someone with something means it is their job, not yours. How did *all* of the kid running around & evening child care become your wife\u2019s job & not your job, too? Sure, she is in the house but she also works full time. Raising the kids is your job, too, not just something you do in the margins when you have time. \n\nIf you put your job ahead of your family time many nights of the week, don\u2019t be surprised when you don\u2019t have any relationship with your kids & they think of you like a wallet because the only thing they know about you is that you make money instead of spending time with them.", "Kindly, YTA. Maybe YOU don't think her birthday was important because you \"already did something\", but clearly, SHE did think it was. \n\nAnd you prioritized your unnecessary overtime over spending time with her in a moment she needed you. So yeah, that was shitty of you.", "You're not TA for how you handled the birthday, but YTA for this entire situation. She also works full time, has been managing FOUR kids all on her own while you just work constantly? This situation just isn't sustainable. You need to start coming home earlier, or find another job. Be there for your partner.", "YTA. Do you really have to work so much? Take time with your family if possible. \nWorking too much and spending too little time with family is a common regret in the deathbed.", "YTA \n\nBut I think this is bigger than the birthday.\n\nYou worked late for two weeks straight, she also works full time, takes care of dinner and manages the children\u2019s extracurricular activities.\n\nYou both need to reconnect and she\u2019s hurt that you didn\u2019t put her first on her actual birthday. I can understand why she feels that way.", "YTA because you need to set boundaries at work.  They will continue this behavior.  You employer being short of employees is not the burden of other employees and you all are just making this harder on yourselves and easier for your boss to not run things right.\n\nHow is it fair that your wife has to pick up your slack at home?", "YTA. You basically did something she\u2018d do either way although you both work, and you dismissed her wishes. I don\u2018t understand people who are married and yet don\u2018t make their partner and their well-being a priority.", "YTA - common sense, my dude. She shouldn\u2019t need to tell you that her birthday is a day you should be home on time.", "YTA she asked if you could get off early for her birthday. You didn't. She told you what she wanted, you said no, she is allowed to be upset over something that is obviously bothering her. She might have wanted to spend the night with you instead of by herself taking care of children, alone, on her birthday. Dude, she literally told you. Don't be surprised that she is upset.", "YTA\n\nShe works full time, does all the childcare, and lives without your basic respect and affection. You don\u2019t love this woman: you\u2019re using her. One day of leaving work on time to be with her on her birthday is the least you could have done.", "Yeah YTA you said you could ask to be home at a reasonable hour any given day and you should have done it even if you already \u201ccelebrated\u201d her birthday", "YTA\n\nHonestly ever think that maybe on her birthday she didn\u2019t want to have to do all the parenting on her own?\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to ask you to come home on time. She\u2019s been picking up the slack for this over time and expressed she is feeling under appreciated.\n\nMany adults celebrate their birthdays on the weekend before and after but when your partner has expressed the need for more appreciation and to be a priority then this goes beyond not being there on her birthday.\n\nSounds like she\u2019s come to terms with you not listening to her. The straw that broke the camels back and it often breaks on occasion like birthdays, anniversaries and holidays when a partner feels all that pent up frustration and another disappointment has just added to the load.", "Light YTA. It's fine to celebrate someone's birthday on another day if you have to, but you should've told her that was your intention first before just assuming she'd be cool with you using that as her time and then working late on her actual birthday.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t decide that you\u2019re celebrating her birthday on the weekend before and not her actual birthday, without mentioning this to your wife until the morning of her birthday.. \n\nIt sounds like you are avoiding family life by going along with the overtime when you don\u2019t actually have to", "YTA lightly. I would guess that this could be about more than her birthday. If you're working until 8/9 PM that often, she's stuck doing ALL the childcare those days with no help (including her birthday if you'd stayed even later), and then getting no time to spend with you. She probably asked you if you're okay with this in hopes you'd say no and you want to come home earlier more often. OT pay is great and all, but sometimes life requires you to participate more than the bare minimum. Maybe it's time to talk with your wife and see how she's really feeling about how much you work. Plus, your kids deserve a present father on more than just the weekends, and you may want to consider prioritizing your family over work if you're not struggling desperately to pay the bills. Your kids are only young for a short while, don't miss it just to work all the time.", "Yta your wife who has straight up told you she is feeling neglected and needs you to work less, is upset that you once again prioritized work over spending time with her. \n\nDoes that help clarify things?  Also, if you're doing all this over time you're leaving all the parenting and housework to her.  \n\nDo you know whose problem it is that you're shorthanded?  The managers. Not yours. Not your family's.  Keep putting your job ahead of your family and in 20 years you'll be on reddit bemoaning the fact that you have no common interests with your wife and your kids never visit you.", "YTA. 100%. How clueless are you? You're counting your OT dollars, while you're completely neglecting your marriage and your partner. \n\nOf COURSE she wanted to celebrate her birthday, on her ACTUAL BIRTHDAY. You completely devalued her as a person, and failed her as a lover, and even a friend. \n\nWhat's she done for YOUR birthdays? The KIDS birthdays? She probably is the one who remembers all your family's birthdays, the holidays,... wow. \n\nDude, get onto TikTok. Start learning about the disparity between the emotional labor women do, and that of men. Start seeing how neglecting your wife this way is ABUSE. This is how love dies. How marriages fail. \n\nHer birthday comes ONCE A YEAR and you know the fucking date... and you should gave taken time off work, taken the kids out to get presents for her at least a week beforehand, made her Wueen for a day to show you appreciate her as a person for all she is and all she does.\n\nYou put the barest little bit in, at your convenience, as barely an afterthought,  and only after missing her actual birthday. You have NO IDEA how brokenhearted she is. \n\nYTA, YTA, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou need to realize that every time you work late, she works late. And she gets no say in that.\n\nShe works full time, and then has to feed the kids, shuttle them to activities, make sure homework gets done, plus handle anything else in your home that needs to be done before 8/9 pm.\n\n(Hit post too soon!)\n\nAnd what do you do when you get home from work? Do you spend a few hours parenting/cleaning/etc. or are you exhausted?\n\nIf you had 2 jobs, you wouldn\u2019t be able to just not show up to your night shift because you wanted to work overtime at your day job. Well, you have two jobs. You need to show up for both.\n\nNot to mention the fact that you seem entirely unconcerned with how little time you\u2019re spending with your family. Why even have a family if you barely see them?", "You \u201chelp\u201d with the kids when you\u2019re home. \n\nOP, what that means is that you\u2019re fobbing off your duties as a father onto someone who is not your kids father. \n\nYTA- but the birthday is the least of the reasons why.", "It\u2019s reasonable that she wants to see more of you on her birthday and can be upset that you\u2019d have to work late. It also sounds like she may have a lot on her plate at the moment.\n\nEdit: changed to YTA as I missed the part where they\u2019re living comfortably and didn\u2019t need the extra OT money.", "Apparently your wife found it important to be with you as much as possible on her birthday. \nWhich isn\u2019t a crazy expectation. Regardless of her running the kids or not it\u2019s nice to have your partner there with you. \n\nFor all she knew you might not have gotten home until 8/9 so I see why she took the kiddos to dinner solo. \n\nI do see where you\u2019re coming from as not having plans , however in your wife\u2019s shoes she has been dealing with you essentially only being home to sleep this whole time. She just hopes her birthday would mean enough to keep you home on time this once.\n\nEdit:: I forgot my vote. NTA but there was def a misunderstanding there that should be addressed. She just misses you and thought she would have you home on time for her Bday", "NAH\n\nSounds like a clash of love languages so to speak. To you the important part was the scale of the celebration, to her it was the timing of it. \n\nI think you should have a talk about it without accussing each other of being assholes. Talk about your hurt feelings, I\u2019m guessing you feel like she\u2019s saying you didnt do enough since you are pointing out the two seperate celebrations and that is hurtful to hear of course. \n\nIf you have this talk now you can both adjust well ahead of time of 40th.", "Idk man, I'm going with NAH, she wanted to spend some time with you in her birthday but, I mean... you had to go to work, right? She getting upset doesn't make her AH and you going to work instead of spending more time with her in her birthday also doesn't make you an AH imo, because you got her to dinner and it's a simple gift as she wanted, no?", "Edit: YTA for presenting this as a case of an adult not having a celebration on the exact date of their birthday, when with your followup comments, it's clear that this is about your disrespect for your wife and her needs in all areas of the relationship. \n\n~~NTA. Adults needing to celebrate a non-milestone birthday on the actual date of the birthday, especially when they've had two celebrations already, are showing a lack of understanding of what's going on in other people's lives.~~", "[removed]", "NAH I think this is just a simple case of miscommunication. She assumed you\u2019d give her a little extra attention on her actual birthday but never really said anything to you. You assumed your weekend celebration was enough for your wife to be satisfied. I don\u2019t think anyone was really at fault here, it\u2019s just a situation that in hindsight should have been talked about and expectations could have been set.\n\nMaybe your wife has been missing you lately and was hoping for an extra gesture. You should make some time for each other I think", "NTA,  You celebrated her birthday all weekend. How many days does she need to be celebrated? I see this too often how women don't appreciate the hard work and long hours their partners put in for their families. Do you think men enjoy working themselves to death with 60 plus hour work weeks? Trust me, we don't. It's not fair to chastise a man who works hard to provide a good life for his family.  I'm sure your wife has no issue with enjoying the lifestyle afforded by all the hard work and ot hours you put in. It's perfectly reasonable for you to assume that a full weekend of celebration for your wifes birthday would be enough to show her how much she is loved and cared for.", "NTA.  Sounds like she didn't properly communicate that she expected you home early for her birthday.  Given your current schedule and the fact that you had the weekend activities, I wouldn't have assumed you'd be home early either.", "NTA you did stuff for her birthday.
