You can't expect people to cater no matter what the issue is.  Did you notice he didn't mention if she was walking right in front of lady, side, far away? ....who was in the area first? Did he try having her walk in a non busy area. Was it an elderly lady, like 80 for ex.? Did they have a disability? What was her culture? People on here are like lemmings, they never question the story teller about anything.  You realize half of these people lie to make themselves look more sympathetic, right?  Let's say he was telling the truth...then he made both the sister and the woman uncomfortable. People shouldn't applaud him for doing this. Just like he wanted a pass for being mean, maybe give the lady a pass for being ignorant.", "Or look at her book.

Overwhelmed I need to run away and isolate. If I can't then meltdown. Which is not pretty."]}
