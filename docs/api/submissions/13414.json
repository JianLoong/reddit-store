I told her to do what calms her down, so she paced around and shook her hands, her therapist calls it stimming, something to do with autism, I don't know much about it. \n\nA lady grabbed her arm gently eventually and asked her to sit down since she was distracting her from reading.\n\nHere's the interaction.\n\nMe: she's just stimming, it helps her not freak out.\n\nHer: she should know better ways to calm down. She shouldn't burden everyone else.\n\nMe: she has autism, she doesn't process things the same way.\n\nHer: oh, she's like, feebleminded?\n\nMe: not in the slightest.\n\nHer: but you just said she had autism.\n\nMe: let's start over. is there any way we could compromise?\n\nHer: I'll be honest, I think she can be a normal person, or get the hell out.\n\nMe: I've been nice, but I'm gonna be frank. You can go elsewhere or get used to it. You can read just fine. She's freaked out, and the least you could do is let her calm down.\n\nHer: oh, okay. I could always get security.\n\nMe: so your plan is to call security on a 13 year old girl for what exactly? Shut up, don't die on this hill.\n\nShe stopped talking after that and let my sister calm down.\n\nMy sister says I was a bit mean, but in all honesty doesn't care and is glad she was allowed to calm down.

People sadly often forget that a meltdown is much more horrible for the person who has it than for those around", "Really?? One case is giving understanding to an anxious person with autism. The other is giving understanding to someone who is distracted and wants to read a book.", "His sister.", "Why is that upsetting?", "Huh, good to know! Thank you for answering my questions =D", "That\u2019s a really clever idea. I never would have thought of it.", "It\u2019s upsetting that his sister overheard the woman calling her feeble minded", "As someone who can relate- let me put it this way. \n\n\nIf I\u2019m overwhelmed, I\u2019ll isolate myself from others, and unless you know me personally and know that I\u2019m extremely avoidant you\u2019d never know I\u2019m overwhelmed.\n\nIf I have a meltdown (which doesn\u2019t often happen for me anymore, at least not externally), it\u2019s happening right here right now, and everyone in the vicinity is going to know about it.\n\nI don\u2019t really have meltdowns anymore but I probably have an avoidant personality disorder at this point, so make of that what you will.", "Yeah. It's also how she figured out how to introduce me to different foods. Offer from her plate but don't force it. She said she felt idiotic a lot though cause she'd go out of her way to make happy sounds when eating so that I'd be interested in trying the new stuff.\n\n\nShe also used to make my lunches as boring yet interesting at the same time for me lol. Only the foods I liked but she'd make them into shapes or use food colouring. She did it until I was 15 lol", "Wow did you hurt your back stretching for that?"]}
