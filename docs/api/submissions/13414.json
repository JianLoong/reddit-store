Our dad recently passed away, and shes really worried about her bio dad in Canada. She's stressed out from bullies, school, and life in general, and her birthday is coming up, so I figured I'd give her some good memories. \n\nShe got pretty worried whenever anything delayed us, and I had her calm herself down and really tried to enforce that everything was fine and the worst was behind us.\n\nOur flight got delayed, and she got really stressed out. I told her to do what calms her down, so she paced around and shook her hands, her therapist calls it stimming, something to do with autism, I don't know much about it. \n\nA lady grabbed her arm gently eventually and asked her to sit down since she was distracting her from reading.\n\nHere's the interaction.\n\nMe: she's just stimming, it helps her not freak out.\n\nHer: she should know better ways to calm down. She shouldn't burden everyone else.\n\nMe: she has autism, she doesn't process things the same way.\n\nHer: oh, she's like, feebleminded?\n\nMe: not in the slightest.\n\nHer: but you just said she had autism.\n\nMe: let's start over. is there any way we could compromise?\n\nHer: I'll be honest, I think she can be a normal person, or get the hell out.\n\nMe: I've been nice, but I'm gonna be frank. You can go elsewhere or get used to it. You can read just fine. She's freaked out, and the least you could do is let her calm down.\n\nHer: oh, okay. I could always get security.\n\nMe: so your plan is to call security on a 13 year old girl for what exactly? Shut up, don't die on this hill.\n\nShe stopped talking after that and let my sister calm down.\n\nMy sister says I was a bit mean, but in all honesty doesn't care and is glad she was allowed to calm down.

The woman was out of line.  Seriously - disturbing her reading?  You were nicer than me.  I would have outright asked her about the cause of her mental issue.  ...actually, I probably would have put her in her place the moment she grabbed my sister.  I'm mean though and don't care about being an asshole to assholes.", "NTA, you should have hit that lady and you'd still be the hero of the situation, well handled on your part \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. I don't think you were mean enough, I wish you said something about her touching your sister's arm.", "NTA. You handled it so good and calm.", "NTA, I'd say you held back what you really wanted to say to her. You should have gotten security for her grabbing your sisters arm actually, she was totally in the wrong for doing that!", "NTA, but if you are in an airport in Canada and someone is harassing anyone, but especially a child based on disability, you can contact security and use those words. Bye bye lady", "NTA\n\nI would have been much less nice myself and I would have encouraged her to get security, for placing her hands on a child she doesn't know.", "NTA, you're the big brother your sister deserves,  in the very best way. As the parent of a child with Autism, I fear I'd have had a *lot* less restraint at that 'feebleminded' comment.", "NTA. You tried to be polite and she was nasty in return. Honestly, I think you were being too kind to that rude woman.", "NTA\n\nRandom lady is a huge asshole though. You were mean, but there's nothing wrong with that. Some people don't understand niceness.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact she threatened to call security because she couldn't read peacefully\" only confirms it. She didn't even ask if your sister was okay or if she could help.", "NTA.\n\nYou handled it perfectly. Yes you were mean. The lady deserved it. A full blown autistic meltdown by 13 year old girl would have REALLY put her off her book. She is lucky to have you.", "NTA, frankly you're a better, and nicer, person than I am.", "Not mean at all. NTA. Your sister stimming has exactly zero impact on this woman's reading. She wasn't in her face, screaming, or being disruptive. She was just flapping her hands and walking around.", "ESH\n\nOf course this lady didn't make a great effort to understand or accommodate a person she didn't understand. But nor did you. You have to explain autism and stimming, and yet you expect people to just shut up and comply with whatever you say? This lady hadn't encountered a person like your sister before. Being curt might have shown how you're protective of your sister, but it also makes you an asshole to the lady who's never been in this situation before.", "NTA\n\nParent of two autistic boys here. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like this, but simple stares get my blood boiling. I don\u2019t think I would have been as calm as you.", "NTA. Your sister's activities created no burden for anybody around her. \n\nNagging Nancy needed to shut her ****ing mouth.", "NTA - Random lady's thoughts belong in lost baggage. You did great.", "NTA. Your sister just lost dad and it will be of great comfort knowing she still has a strong man to look out for her.", "NTA and frankly I would\u2019ve been a lot more mean", "Lmao that woman is literally stupid, I would have been way harsher and felt absolutely no guilt about it. NTA", "NTA. She's lucky it took that long for you to get mean. She shouldn't have touched a person she didn't know. If your sister had reacted violently to a stranger grabbing her arm it could have turned bad quickly.", "NTA - that woman was being completely judgemental while your sister was doing her best to calm herself down while you were sticking up for her. That woman is the AH here, you did the right thing.", "Definitely NTA you didn\u2019t even ask the lady if SHE was \u201cfeeble minded\u201d since she can\u2019t understand basic communication or have any empathy", "100% NTA, and THANK YOU for standing up for your sister that way! I can't tell you how many times I've had similar interactions regarding my son, who is also Autistic, and the entitlement of some people is astonishing to me.\n\nSo good on you for not backing down, and making sure your sister's needs were accommodated! \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA - You handle the situation very well and are a amazing sister", "NTA I don\u2019t see anything rude in what you said. But what upsets me is that your sister thinking you were mean shows that she could hear and understand what was being said about her. Good job advocating for you sister, she lucky to have someone like you in her life", "NTA!! She\u2019s literally minding her own business pacing to calm herself down, the lady was the one causing problems! Your sister has every right to walk in an airport without being told to stop because she\u2019s distracting. Try not to dwell on it too much so y\u2019all can have a fun trip!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

INFO:  Did you time travel to the 1960s?", "NTA\n\nAnd credit to you for controlling yourself as well as you did, if it was me I would have been in her face the moment she grabbed her arm.", "NTA. \nAs soon as I read a strange woman put their hands on a child they were unrelated to, you immediately became NTA.", "NTA. You were SO MUCH nicer than I would have been. I would have told that lady to hurry up and kick rocks so your sister could calm down in peace.", "NTA\n\nFeebleminded? Hats off to your control, I would not have been so polite or stayed this calm.\n\nAnd what was she saying this to everyone else on the airport that were walking off anywhere near her? It is not her home, she can't control what anybody does. And she wants to call security on a 13 year old child for walking? Go ahead and let the security laugh at her as well.", "NTA.

Kudos.", "NTA\nSocial education about autism is everywhere currently. The woman isn\u2019t ignorant, she was being deliberately cruel and bullying a 13 year old child. \n\nShe had the audacity to touch a child that wasn\u2019t hers to touch. It is never acceptable to grab a stranger, especially not a child.", "No where near too mean big bro. Why this lady thinks it is alright to touch your sister is beyond me. It sounds like you were very reasonable. \n\nFeeble minded is a good way of describing her for not being able to concentrate on her reading which she supposedly wanted to do. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Like I'm Autistic, so is my husband, and three of our four children, and the only child who isn't Autistic has ADHD, (so still has sensory meltdowns). \n\nAll I'm thinking while reading this was, just wait until she starts having a meltdown, if she's not being allowed to stim to get past her sensory overload. Then that woman is reeeeeally gonna have a hard time reading.", "I was thinking exactly they same. Are you feeble minded? Because you are the one who can\u2019t read with people walking around in a public place. NTA", "Exactly.  I don\u2019t have anyone in my life who is autistic, but I\u2019m well aware what stimming is, and I sympathize when I see someone in public doing it, as I know they must be dealing with heavy emotions.", "You totally undereacted!  NTA by a million miles."]}
