Our dad recently passed away, and shes really worried about her bio dad in Canada. She's stressed out from bullies, school, and life in general, and her birthday is coming up, so I figured I'd give her some good memories. \n\nShe got pretty worried whenever anything delayed us, and I had her calm herself down and really tried to enforce that everything was fine and the worst was behind us.\n\nOur flight got delayed, and she got really stressed out. I told her to do what calms her down, so she paced around and shook her hands, her therapist calls it stimming, something to do with autism, I don't know much about it. \n\nA lady grabbed her arm gently eventually and asked her to sit down since she was distracting her from reading.\n\nHere's the interaction.\n\nMe: she's just stimming, it helps her not freak out.\n\nHer: she should know better ways to calm down. She shouldn't burden everyone else.\n\nMe: she has autism, she doesn't process things the same way.\n\nHer: oh, she's like, feebleminded?\n\nMe: not in the slightest.\n\nHer: but you just said she had autism.\n\nMe: let's start over. is there any way we could compromise?\n\nHer: I'll be honest, I think she can be a normal person, or get the hell out.\n\nMe: I've been nice, but I'm gonna be frank. You can go elsewhere or get used to it. You can read just fine. She's freaked out, and the least you could do is let her calm down.\n\nHer: oh, okay. I could always get security.\n\nMe: so your plan is to call security on a 13 year old girl for what exactly? Shut up, don't die on this hill.\n\nShe stopped talking after that and let my sister calm down.\n\nMy sister says I was a bit mean, but in all honesty doesn't care and is glad she was allowed to calm down.

I'm mean though and don't care about being an asshole to assholes.", "NTA, you should have hit that lady and you'd still be the hero of the situation, well handled on your part \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. I don't think you were mean enough, I wish you said something about her touching your sister's arm.", "NTA. You handled it so good and calm.", "NTA, I'd say you held back what you really wanted to say to her. You should have gotten security for her grabbing your sisters arm actually, she was totally in the wrong for doing that!", "NTA, but if you are in an airport in Canada and someone is harassing anyone, but especially a child based on disability, you can contact security and use those words. Bye bye lady", "NTA\n\nI would have been much less nice myself and I would have encouraged her to get security, for placing her hands on a child she doesn't know.", "NTA, you're the big brother your sister deserves,  in the very best way. As the parent of a child with Autism, I fear I'd have had a *lot* less restraint at that 'feebleminded' comment.", "NTA. You tried to be polite and she was nasty in return. Honestly, I think you were being too kind to that rude woman.", "NTA\n\nRandom lady is a huge asshole though. You were mean, but there's nothing wrong with that. Some people don't understand niceness.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact she threatened to call security because she couldn't read peacefully\" only confirms it. She didn't even ask if your sister was okay or if she could help.", "NTA.\n\nYou handled it perfectly. Yes you were mean. The lady deserved it. A full blown autistic meltdown by 13 year old girl would have REALLY put her off her book. She is lucky to have you.", "NTA, frankly you're a better, and nicer, person than I am.", "Not mean at all. NTA. Your sister stimming has exactly zero impact on this woman's reading. She wasn't in her face, screaming, or being disruptive. She was just flapping her hands and walking around.", "ESH\n\nOf course this lady didn't make a great effort to understand or accommodate a person she didn't understand. But nor did you. You have to explain autism and stimming, and yet you expect people to just shut up and comply with whatever you say? This lady hadn't encountered a person like your sister before. Being curt might have shown how you're protective of your sister, but it also makes you an asshole to the lady who's never been in this situation before.", "NTA\n\nParent of two autistic boys here. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like this, but simple stares get my blood boiling. I don\u2019t think I would have been as calm as you.", "NTA. Your sister's activities created no burden for anybody around her. \n\nNagging Nancy needed to shut her ****ing mouth.", "NTA - Random lady's thoughts belong in lost baggage. You did great.", "NTA. Your sister just lost dad and it will be of great comfort knowing she still has a strong man to look out for her.", "NTA and frankly I would\u2019ve been a lot more mean", "Lmao that woman is literally stupid, I would have been way harsher and felt absolutely no guilt about it. NTA", "NTA. She's lucky it took that long for you to get mean. She shouldn't have touched a person she didn't know. If your sister had reacted violently to a stranger grabbing her arm it could have turned bad quickly.", "NTA - that woman was being completely judgemental while your sister was doing her best to calm herself down while you were sticking up for her. That woman is the AH here, you did the right thing.", "Definitely NTA you didn\u2019t even ask the lady if SHE was \u201cfeeble minded\u201d since she can\u2019t understand basic communication or have any empathy", "100% NTA, and THANK YOU for standing up for your sister that way! I can't tell you how many times I've had similar interactions regarding my son, who is also Autistic, and the entitlement of some people is astonishing to me.\n\nSo good on you for not backing down, and making sure your sister's needs were accommodated! \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA - You handle the situation very well and are a amazing sister", "NTA I don\u2019t see anything rude in what you said.

Good job advocating for you sister, she lucky to have someone like you in her life", "NTA!! She\u2019s literally minding her own business pacing to calm herself down, the lady was the one causing problems!

The woman isn\u2019t ignorant, she was being deliberately cruel and bullying a 13 year old child. \n\nShe had the audacity to touch a child that wasn\u2019t hers to touch. It is never acceptable to grab a stranger, especially not a child.", "No where near too mean big bro. Why this lady thinks it is alright to touch your sister is beyond me.

Then that woman is reeeeeally gonna have a hard time reading.", "I was thinking exactly they same. Are you feeble minded? Because you are the one who can\u2019t read with people walking around in a public place. NTA", "Exactly.  I don\u2019t have anyone in my life who is autistic, but I\u2019m well aware what stimming is, and I sympathize when I see someone in public doing it, as I know they must be dealing with heavy emotions.", "You totally undereacted!

She needs to find a better way to deal with it than asking others to stop moving around. Your sister was well within her rights to be walking around and shaking her hands.

Even if she hasn't encountered an autistic person before, the odds that she has never encountered *anyone* with high energy, restless leg syndrome, or any other thing that causes ppl to pace is very low. Walking around is not odd behavior in the slightest-yeah, the shaking hands thing on top of it is less common, but there's no way that should ever be enough to just completely stump other ppl and make them lose their minds. \n\nIt's someone walking around. There's nothing to understand. Leave them alone if they're not doing anything to you. It's not rocket science.", "You don't have to have experience with autism to know better than to be rude and abrasive about someone who isn't causing an actual problem.

Meltdown is just straight up screaming, crying, aggresively chewing on things/other self soothing actions  up to 11 because there is too much shit tm.", "Yeah, as soon as she threatened to call security, I would have welcomed it and explained to them that this weird lady was touching my little sister.", "no, autistic people and our loved ones do not need to make allistic people comfortable. you're also clearly missing the point that OP was pretty polite to this woman. you're justifying ableism, which isn't a good look.", "Let's say OP had punched the woman in the face and screamed \"SHUT UPPPP\" to her. Would that make her an asshole? Is there \\_anything\\_ that would not have been justified doing in defense of her autistic sister? Or would OP simply be incapable of being the asshole as long as she's defending her sister?"]}
