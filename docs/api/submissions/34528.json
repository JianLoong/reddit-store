{"id": 34528, "submission_id": "190smi7", "title": "AITA for calling out my coworker for taking a shift \"for fun\" when a struggling coworker could've taken it instead?", "selftext": "We work a retail job. Our job lets us \"exchange\" shifts through the app - if someone doesn't want their shift, they can give it up and let someone take it on a first come first serve basis.\n\nMy coworker is a very rich guy. He's a student and the only reason, as he admitted, that he took this job is because he wanted something fun to do and because college is boring so far. He's said that he doesn't need the money at all because his parents are rich and they buy him whatever he wants including the awesome car he's driving now. He has like 6 figures in his bank account right now because his parents just give him money whenever he wants. So the few hundred dollars he gets every two weeks is essentially nothing to him - he practically would notice no change since its such a tiny amount compared to the money he has...\n\nSo I was on break with him and he showed me a shift that's available on the app. He said he wasn't doing anything that day so he would take that shift.\n\nI told him that our other coworkers are struggling unlike him, and they simply aren't getting enough shifts because there aren't that many available. Some of us work two jobs and still don't get enough hours. This isn't just some theory, I can count so many people I work with that are basically begging for shifts but these days corporate hasn't been offering any. Yes they should switch jobs but in the meantime, they still need to work.\n\nI told him that he should let someone who really needs the hours to take that shift, instead of taking it himself. He told me that it's not his problem and we had an argument over this. I think what he's doing is crappy. He told me that I should basically mind my business and he's gonna take the shift regardless. He's angry that I take issue with this but I don't think he understands what other coworkers are going through.\n\nI work full time here, fortunately so I get 40 hours always, and I see this kid 3 times a week, so I don't think he'll be that affected without this particular shift", "created_utc": 1704635645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190smi7/aita_for_calling_out_my_coworker_for_taking_a/", "score": 345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s full of shit and he does need money and just telling tall tales at work. \n\nRetail is awful to work at, nobody does it \u201cfor fun\u201d and if he really had so much money - he would be out doing stuff all time or literally ANYTHING ELSE.", "YTA.  If he has SOO much money, why is he really working in retail?? It's not because he's bored. It's because he needs the job. It could be for a variety of reasons, reasons that shouldn't concern you because it's not your business. You'll learn soon you can't always take what people say at face value. Use some common sense and logic and ask yourself, why would a rich college kid CHOOSE to work retail if he didn't need the money?? This kid is trying to put up a facade.", "YTA and it sounds like you just don't like him.  \n  \nI highly doubt someone would say \"I don't need the money at all because my parents are rich and buy me whatever I want including the awesome car I drive now\". \n  \n> He has like 6 figures in his bank account right now because his parents just give him money whenever he wants.  \n  \nHonestly sounds like gossip. \"has like 6 figures\" tells me he didn't tell you shit and you're assuming because he's well off with a nice car.   \n  \n> he showed me a shift that's available on the app. He said he wasn't doing anything that day so he would take that shift.  \n  \nWhy would he just randomly be like oh hey im going to pick up this shift. What really happened was you saw he picked up the shift then went off on him.  \n  \nThis screams of work drama and gossip all because he has a nice car so you talk shit and look for a reason to go off on him.", "YTA. If someone had wanted it they would have taken the shift. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s on the app all day snatching up shifts. \n\nAlso I highly doubt he has six figures in the bank. If his parents can gift a student six figures they wouldn\u2019t transfer straight cash. They\u2019d be worried about the gift tax exemption and give him a credit card instead. And with that much cash he could find something more fun to do than work.", "YTA. There's no such thing as \"taking shifts from people who need it more\". You don't know his full financial situation. You don't know whether this job is the only thing keeping him from succumbing to depression. \n\nYou don't know. \n\nThat's what makes you TA.", "Why didn\u2019t the other workers get the shift via the app?", "YTA. You should mind your business. Also IMO your coworker is lying to you about his wealth. I doubt a rich college student could find nothing else to do with his spare time other than work retail.  He's FOS.", "I used to work a kitchen job with a guy that drove a brand new bmw. He had nice clothes on all the time. Wore expensive jewellery. Spent money on people at the bar after his shift while he was sober and didn\u2019t drink. He\u2019d buy co-workers kids things for their birthdays. He\u2019d offer people thousands of dollars when they had unexpected life things (car broke down, oven broke, kids need braces, etc.) \n\nWell, we all assumed this guy was loaded and just working for the social aspect. People here are quick to dismiss this but there are plenty of senior citizens that work retail jobs for that very reason. Something to do, get them out of the house and be social with people. Keeps them young if you will. Anyway back to the \u201crich guy\u201d I worked with. Wouldn\u2019t it turn out that he wasn\u2019t rich. He would leave his 8 hour shift in our kitchen and drive to another job and work another 8-10 hour shift. He\u2019d sleep in his car between jobs so it was honestly unclear if he was homeless. I later found out the reason he wore and had all that fancy stuff was because his family thought he was a doctor. The reason he was so generous was because he was just a good guy. \n\nPeople work jobs for many different reasons. My dad worked at a hardware store after he retired cuz he wasn\u2019t ready to sit around all day yet. He didn\u2019t need the money and would often use it to help my brother with his bills. My sister went through a tough depressive episode a few years ago. She quit her job making $100k+ a year and stayed in her room for basically a year straight. After that year, my mom convinced her to get a job at the local gym. She had plenty of money in the bank and I\u2019m sure the couple hundred bucks every 2 weeks wasn\u2019t noticed. However I believe that gym job is what saved my sister. She got back on her feet and figured life out again. \n\nThis is true for any minimum wage job you work. There will be people there for different reasons then you. Some will not be there for the money and as hard as that is to wrap your head around, you\u2019ll have to get used to it", "YTA. It seems like you mean well, but if you start down that road, next thing you know it\u2019s the poverty Olympics every time a shift comes up.", "YTA. Him taking this one shift isn't keeping people from taking other shifts. He's right; you should mind your own business.", "YTA. It's a job. Whoever takes the shift, works the shift. If the other coworker needs more money, they can get another job. It's preposterous that one employee gets all/most of the extra shifts because they need the money. We all need money lol.", "YTA.\n\nPresumably the \"Struggling\" coworker had access to that same information, correct?  So if he is free and wants to pick up the shift, that is his right.   The other coworker had the chance and didn't do it.\n\nYour way of thinking is actually REALLY bad, when it comes to full time jobs.\n\nThink about it this way.  You and a coworker are both vying for a promotion.  You come from money, but are a better employee.  They are struggling to pay bills and have kids.  Should they get the promotion just because of their personal situation?  Absolutlely not.  But it is something that some managers will do, and it sucks.\n\nYou can feel bad for someone's personal situation, but in a professional work setting, it should be about getting the job done, and nothing else.", "YTA. It's not up to you to tell someone how to run their lives. I presume the struggling co workers have the same opportunity to sign up.\n\nI absolutely hate people who stick their noses in to other people's work lives. It's literally none of your business. I used to refuse working Sundays. I'm not doing it. Some colleagues got a bit moody about it. It was a boundary I was not prepared to negotiate and I didn't feel like I needed to explain to anyone other than the boss. If they need more people they should have hired instead of getting colleagues to lean on me. They even complained they'd have to do it themselves..idiots!! Don't be surprised if he acts rudely to you in future, you've been rude to him.", "I doubt that you actually know what his bank balance is.\n\nMore likely, he grew up with rich parents & is trying to act as though he has all that money but in reality he doesn't.\n\nYour \"rich\" coworker is probably struggling just as much but is too proud to admit it so he bluffs about doing it for fun. No-one actually works retail for fun, and & definitely not bored rich kids. \n\nYTA for assuming you know what his real situation is.", "YTA.   He probably is expected to work hard.  Meaning go to school and have a job.  His family probably does not tolerate anything less than maximum effort at all times. You have no idea what his life is like.", "YTA - you said it yourself, it's first come first serve. If he sees a shift that hasn't been taken, it's completely fair for him to take it. It's not like he's going around the system and stealing shifts. It's none of your business, and as some people mentioned, he might need the shift for a reason other than money. Or maybe he just loves to work. Either way, you shouldn't be losing sleep over this kid. You seem to be the immature one here.", "YTA, nobody with six figures sitting in their bank account is working a retail job for fun. And if someone else wanted the shift as badly as you say, they would have picked it up before he could. You don't even have someone in mind that you think deserves the shift in particular, you just don't want him to have it. \n\n\nYou know what else would open up more shifts for you coworkers? If you quit. Why don't you do that? That would free up 40 hours a week permanently instead of one shift, wouldn't it?", "YTA he\u2019s not just there for fun, it\u2019s deeper and no may not be a financial need, but he very likely has to be, for any number of reasons.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s an open shift on the app, which means no one has taken it yet.  He doesn\u2019t have inside info.  It\u2019s the same info everyone has.  So if they want the shift and need it that badly they should or would be scouring the app, right?", "Hm. YTA\n\n\nBut I am willing to bet if his parents do have all this money then they probably cut him off. Really rich kids who are looking for \u201cfun\u201d tend to get a hobby, go out with friends, volunteer to improve resumes, or use their parents\u2019 connections to get \u201cinternships.\u201d \n\n\nAs for picking up, I\u2019m sure the person posting just wants it covered", "YTA. Mind your business. It doesn\u2019t affect you at all so why tf are you being such a dick?  Work on your own life and don\u2019t try to control others.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t decide who should work and who shouldn\u2019t.", "YTA. Everyone is entitled to pick up shifts, work is work and personal is personal. He may be extremely depressed and this job provides him with an outlet. Or some other reason that you don\u2019t know about because it\u2019s not you business.", "YTA - While it's nice you're trying to advocate for your fellow coworkers who maybe would get more benefit from the hours, it's really none of your business why someone is taking an open shift if it's up for grabs. Maybe the shift was already looked at by your other coworkers and they couldn't take it because, as you said, some of them work multiple jobs so maybe they weren't available for that shift. Don't blame the coworker who \"doesn't need the money\" and shame them for taking the shift, take your frustrations instead out on the company who doesn't give enough hour or a living wage to the workers.\n\nETA: Quotes around \"doesn't need the money\" because I highly doubt this co-worker showed you a bank statement proving he had 6 figures in his account, so you don't *really* know his financial situation.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nNo one works a retail job for fun and you don\u2019t know his finances. He was free to pick up that shift just as much as anyone else.", "YTA. People are allowed to work for reasons other than financial. Obviously, we don\u2019t know this persons real motivations for working, but if money isn\u2019t the issue, they could be doing it for experience, mental health, skill development, a sense of independence, opportunity to socialize and develop interpersonal skills and friendships, etc. any/all of these reasons are \u201cgood\u201d reasons. Mind your business.", "YTA- Sounds like the shifts are first come first serve, if your\u201cpoor\u201d coworkers need the shifts it\u2019s on them to keep up with the app. \n\nMind your own business!", "YTA. He might not need the money as much as others, but he is doing the same work as everyone else, at the same pay as everyone else. As far as you've mentioned, he doesn't goof off any more than anyone else and does his job seriously.

First come first served, you said it yourself. It\u2019s not, most in poverty gets first dibs. \n\nIf you or your co workers cared so much about making sure certain people get more shifts then contact those people individually to let them know they can have your shift. \n\nYou don\u2019t care about your struggling coworkers you just don\u2019t like this guy and don\u2019t want him to have it. Jealousy maybe?", "YTA\n\nwhat makes you think you can decide other peoples lives and how shifts will affect them. You only know what you know because this guy is boasting about his life, maybe he super exaggerated his wealth. Even if not , he is still entitled to work the same as everyone else.

Maybe he wants to make his own money.\n\nhe is correct, mind you own business", "YTA - it isn\u2019t up to you to police the shift exchange app. The shift is listed there and every other worker can see it too.

Further, our employer shares responsibility for this inequitable distribution of shifts. He was often allowed to simply send emails to management saying he would take \"any open shifts\" therefore claiming all shifts immediately.

Our job lets us \"exchange\" shifts through the app - if someone doesn't want their shift, they can give it up and let someone take it on a first come first serve basis.\n\nMy coworker is a very rich guy. He's a student and the only reason, as he admitted, that he took this job is because he wanted something fun to do and because college is boring so far. He's said that he doesn't need the money at all because his parents are rich and they buy him whatever he wants including the awesome car he's driving now. He has like 6 figures in his bank account right now because his parents just give him money whenever he wants. So the few hundred dollars he gets every two weeks is essentially nothing to him - he practically would notice no change since its such a tiny amount compared to the money he has...\n\nSo I was on break with him and he showed me a shift that's available on the app. He said he wasn't doing anything that day so he would take that shift.\n\nI told him that our other coworkers are struggling unlike him, and they simply aren't getting enough shifts because there aren't that many available. Some of us work two jobs and still don't get enough hours. This isn't just some theory, I can count so many people I work with that are basically begging for shifts but these days corporate hasn't been offering any. Yes they should switch jobs but in the meantime, they still need to work.\n\nI told him that he should let someone who really needs the hours to take that shift, instead of taking it himself. He told me that it's not his problem and we had an argument over this. I think what he's doing is crappy. He told me that I should basically mind my business and he's gonna take the shift regardless. He's angry that I take issue with this but I don't think he understands what other coworkers are going through.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the past (in my 20's) I was shouted at by the mommy club in my place for working overtime (Car envy-how ridiculous).  My story is on this site many a times.  I am going to tell it to you.  this particular single mother accused me of stealing all of the overtime and taking food out of her kids mouths.  MIND YOU, she could have worked the same overtime.  There was unlimited.  No one was denied overtime.  Even though I lived at home, I was stashing money away to move out and I gave my mother money for stuff she needed.  No was not in my vocabulary toward her.  She was working two jobs because my stupid father was disabled and spending money like it was going out of style.  I had sports cars-A f\\*cking Ford Probe SE which is not even the caliber of a Mustang.  It was a cheaper 'rod.  I was saving for a down payment on a town home or a house.  If I knew then what I know now, I would have bought a house before that when they were cheap.  Getting back to the subject, my friend who was also single, said, I didn't realize that the overtime was for married people.  Suffice to say, I never gave up the overtime and to this day at 54, any overtime available, I work!  It's my life.  I have to take care of myself.  I have to walk my own path.  I also work another job, but it's for the gig apps.  Without them, I cannot pay the other half of my mortgage because  my mother had a stroke and we were sharing the expenses at the time and I was working that before she had it.  I started at the beginning of the pandemic.  My mother had the stroke the year after.   Guess what, I drive in a Ford Mustang.  Some use a Mercedes where I am.  Should we give up the gig economy for others less fortunate and let myself live on the streets for them?  NO!  If I don't work a second job, my house will be foreclosed on.  No, I won't sell a car that's paid off! That will not help with the insurance premiums because I don't have a GT!  Any car would be as much as mine. I know that for a fact.
