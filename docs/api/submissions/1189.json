It last for maybe 5 minutes or until she gets her way. We think she does this because she was raised by a mother who wanted a baby and not a child. She was the centre of her mums focus while she was a cute chubby cheeked infant and then abandoned as she grew into a child with more complex needs. So she regresses to this baby persona whenever she is upset and wants attention or to get her way. \n\nI do not tolerate this when I am around, I'm not rude or cruel about it. I just tell her she is a big girl now and she needs to use her big girl voice when she is talking to me or I'm just not going to listen. She's fully capable of doing so, she just doesn't unless you remind her.\n\nSome of the family think this is very nasty and it's 'just what she does'. Some of my friends also think I'm being cruel to her because she's neurodivergent and 'can't help it'. She can help it and I don't think that encouraging it to continue is good for her. She's in high school now and needs to be helped with developing coping mechanisms and communication, not further babified.

If when she is upset, she reverts to this and this continues in teenage years or adult, they are not helping her but making it harder.\n\nThis sounds like a stress reaction or tantrum but every child has to learn to react in positive ways and if they parents or family are doing her disservice.\n\nWhen putting in boundaries and teaching about appropriate reactions for neurodivergent children, if about doing in a way which they can understand, explaining it in line with thought patterns.\n\nSo you telling her to speak in proper voice is correct and will help over time.\n\nThe rest of the family appear to just given in to her but that helping and will cause issues down the line.", "YTA because you are not recognizing your niece's neurodivergent needs and you aren't being very understanding.

I'm neurodivergent and that doesn't mean I can't be corrected on bad behavior. She obviously CAN help it if she stops when you remind her to do it. Besides, if everyone coddles her now, how is she going to be prepared for the real world when she becomes an adult?", "NTA. She's still a child who needs boundaries and to be taught how to communicate. From your post and your comments she is capable of communicating in a more adult way.

It sounds like she does understand not to do it but others treat her like she's disabled and aren't trying to help her grow as much as she can", "NTA, but there's some armchair therapists who are probably going to disagree", "Soft YTA here because your heart is in  the right  place -- to help you niece -- but your methodology sucks. Instead of telling her you are going to ignore her, model a better way of communicating and give her lots of positive attention and praise for attempting or doing the modeled behavior.  Ignoring her is not an effective way to teach her a different way of doing things, particularly is she is special needs. It may take a while for her to learn a different way since she is an older student and has been acting this way all her life. Since you only see her once or twice a year, you alone don't have the enough contact time with her to make big changes but you might consider speaking to her parents about this if your relationship is close.", "INFO\n\nDoes your niece have a diagnosis as neurodivergent? Or are the behaviour problems and meltdowns being linked to her upbringing and the neglect she suffered?  \n\n\nIf she is diagnosed with a neurodivergent condition she may not be able to help her switch to her baby voice. But if it is learned behaviour then it may be some thing she can unlearn.", "YTA. You sound like you have no idea what you're talking about, but you're going with discriminating anyways. Does it actually matter what sort of \"voice\" she uses?", "NTA. Tell the people complaining to talk to an actual professional on whatever neurodivergent condition your niece has. You're handling this exactly right. Neurodivergence doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't correct undesirable behaviors and it doesn't mean she can't learn and grow.", "YTA. You're not a parent to the kid and you only see her a few times a year, what gives you the right to make all of these assumptions about why she behaves the way she does and what the best way to handle it is? You can redirect her behavior gently like you said you did but judging by your harsh criticisms of this kid and the fact that people who care about her called your methods \"nasty\", it sounds like you were meaner than you made it out to be in your post. In any case unless you are a professional in how to discipline a ND child, you need to respect the requests of the parent/family as far as how and when to intervene.", "NTA.", "YTA. Not for not indulging it. That\u2019s fine. But you seem quite hard on her for how her emotional difficulties manifest themselves. \n\nGiven what sounds like a traumatic childhood, combined with neurodiversity, I think you could cut her some slack", "NTA You\u2019re teaching your niece a valuable skit, confidence. She knows she can do it , then it becomes a battle with her brain over which voice to use.", "This is how I feel, she can't be sheltered forever. One day she is going to get into situations which will be especially difficult for her to face with the problems she has, I feel like we are doing her a disservice by not teaching her better ways to cope with that.", "I see where the miscommunication is, I only see her rarely but I'm not the only adult in her life trying to discourage this behaviour. The other sees her much more often so it is something she hears a lot and we have been slowly working on it for a number of years now. She very much does get positive attention for doing her big girl voice when asking for things, we believe in praise and affirmation. And she won't be utterly ignored, it's more of a \"I understand that you need something, can you ask me in your big girl voice first\"", "She is diagnosed, but this particular habit is definitely is something she can help. In fact we have made some progress in that she rarely does it when around people who it doesn't work on (by this i mean womt give in to what she wants when she does it). She now does it with/in front of people on whom it does.", "I'm sorry if it came across that I'm unsympathetic, I really really am. The life she's had breaks my heart. I just don't think that sadness is a justifation for never helping her grow. I don't blame her for these manifestations, I just want to help her move on from them", "I\u2019m glad to hear that. I think she\u2019s still very young and there are ways to supportively help her grow out of it. Maybe even talking to her about it but not while it\u2019s happening. \n\nUnless she\u2019s Mona Lisa from Parks and Rec, she will most likely grow out of it organically."]}
