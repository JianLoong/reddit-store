She took a job across the country but couldn\u2019t find any apartments in our area that did a short-term lease after hers ended in April. She is paying us rent, though it\u2019s a lot cheaper as the only space that\u2019s exclusively hers is her bedroom and she has to obviously share the rest of the house. We do not have a rental agreement in place. As this was just a guest room, it\u2019s not something we would rent out anyway, so if she upped and moved tomorrow, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019d be out any sort of money. It\u2019s just a way for her to have a stable place to crash until she moves.\n\nIn addition to our two kids, my husband and I also have a puppy, Merlin. We adopted him back in November and have gone through all the steps to get him trained (he\u2019s not our first dog). Now, Kim is not a dog person. She\u2019s not allergic, there\u2019s no trauma associated, we didn\u2019t even have one growing up. Ever since we were kids, she just didn\u2019t like dogs. Kim was aware of Merlin when she moved in and they\u2019ve co-existed fine. Merlin doesn\u2019t even go upstairs (where her room is) and I think he can sense she\u2019s not a fan, so he mostly steers clear of her.\n\nWe adopted Merlin from a rescue and were told the other 2 puppies in the litter were also adopted out. Then we got a text this week from the woman who runs the rescue, asking if we knew anyone who wanted a dog. Merlin\u2019s sister, Sprinkles, was adopted shortly after he was but returned as the family did not anticipate the needs of the breed (they\u2019re hyperactive dogs who need lots of room to run, along with multiple walks a day). After talking about it with my husband and kids, along with visiting Sprinkles at her foster home, we agreed we wanted to adopt her.\n\nWe told Kim and the first word out of her mouth was \u201cno\u201d. I gave her a weird look and she said that she \u201ctolerates\u201d Merlin but she doesn\u2019t want another dog running around the house. I told her that we planned on doing the same thing with Sprinkles as we did Merlin. She\u2019ll stay on the ground level. Plus, as my husband and I will be training her after work, she won\u2019t even be inside a lot when my sister is. Kim said if we want another dog, we should wait until she moves out in October.\nHonestly, we were planning on getting a companion for Merlin at one point, just not this soon. Kim never asked about our plans when she moved in, but admittedly we never told her this, as we didn\u2019t think it\u2019d come up.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, we signed the paperwork and are picking Sprinkles up tomorrow. My sister is pissed and says this isn\u2019t fair, as she has nowhere else to go and she hates dogs.

As if she owned the house. It isn\u2019t her house, it isn\u2019t her rules. Adopt that pup! I root for you and your husband, adopting the pup is a noble and kind hearted thing to do. NTA", "NTA - its your home and you are free to run it as you see fit, if your sister cant handle it she should leave sooner. She doesn't seem to realize she is there on your good graces, not her entitlement.", "NTA.  She's a guest in your home, paying reduced rent for her room & access to the entire home.  She \"tolerates\" Merlin.  LOL - you are \"tolerating\" her living in your home, have made concessions for her to be comfortable & she is acting a bit too entitled.  This is YOUR home.  Period.  She does not have to like dogs.  But for her to expect you to live your life around her, again, sounds entitled.  No reason for her to be \"pissed.\"", "NTA. It's not up to her. She's staying at YOUR place and doesn't make the rules. She needs to suck it up for a while until she finds a new place.", "Animal lover here,  NTA - your house, your rules.  Your sister is free to move out to her own apartment whenever she wants.  \n\nShe is trying to impose rules in a household where your dogs don't intrude on her personal space.  If you were trying to make her responsible for your pets it would be a completely different ruling, but for now, not an asshole.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your house and you\u2019re already being generous by hosting her there. And it sounds like the dog will be well trained and not a nuisance to her. And if it bothers her that much she can find her own place", "NTA if the dogs bother your sister so much she could find another room to rent for 5 months.", "NTA, your house, your rules.\n\nI was originally thinking that as a courtesy you could have waited but since it\u2019s Merlin\u2019s sister, that\u2019s an extenuating circumstance that can\u2019t just wait until your sis leaves. It sounds like you made the right long term decision for your family.", "NTA\n\nYour house = your rules. If she doesn\u2019t like it, tell her that you\u2019re happy for her to seek alternate living arrangements. \nIf she wants you to keep doing her a *favour* by letting her stay in your home, then she has **no** say in whether or not you decide to adopt 12 more dogs, let alone 1.", "NTA, your sister is being very entitled.", "NTA, but please show us the dogs", "NTA. You are doing her a favor. There's no reason why she'd get a say in this.", "NTA especially because it wasn\u2019t like you went out of the way to get a dog but it\u2019s literally the sibling of your current dog. As a dog owner, I\u2019d take either of my dogs siblings if the opportunity arose and the dog is in need a new home. The dog could be dead by October if you didn\u2019t take her in (at least near me with kill shelters).", "NTA. This is your home and your sister has no say in the decisions you make. It sounds like time for her to move out.", "NTA.  Good luck", "I kind of went back and forth on this one because of the rent aspect. She is paying rent and she rented the room with a certain expectation for the dynamic of the house. It\u2019s like renting a room from a non-smoker who then decides to take up smoking. However, what it comes down to is you\u2019re doing her a favor by letting her stay there in the first place. You wouldn\u2019t be renting the room out otherwise. \n\nUltimately, she is a guest in your home. Just because she is paying rent does not mean she gets to dictate what goes on in the house. You\u2019re not asking her to take care of the dog, train it, take it for walks, etc. She is free to stay in her room when she is home if she doesn\u2019t want to interact with the dog, but she doesn\u2019t get to tell you what you can and cannot do in your home, which again, she is a guest in. If it\u2019s too much of a burden, she can rent a room from someone else in a dog free house. \n\nYou know the old saying, beggars can\u2019t be choosers\u2026NTA", "NTA and you are not wrong. You are allowing your sister a place to crash for a small amount in rent. She doesn't pay your mortgage or utilities so I don't understand how she thinks she can say no to you adopting Sprinkles.\n\nYour CB of a sister can either get on board or find a place of her own! You are helping her out and if she expects your entire life and lifestyle to stop just because she is living there she is deLULU (delusional). The way that you choose to run your house and the pets that you choose to have in your house are not up to your sister! If she doesn't like it she can find somewhere else to rent!!", "NAH.  You have every right, but it would be kind to wait.  Since she\u2019s paying rent, it would be nice to consider her.  If she were freeloading, it\u2019d be different, but it sounds like she\u2019s pitching in and has a plan to be out in a timely fashion.\n\nThere is no real way to anticipate the quirks of a new dog and the struggles of training.  Unlike your current one, he may not avoid your sister.  It\u2019s an unnerving and unpleasant situation for someone who doesn\u2019t want to be around dogs.  Essentially, it sounds like she\u2019s going to be trapped until October.  Maybe she will be lucky and can find somewhere else to go, but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t have options at the moment.", "NTA, not her house, not her rules, besides, might be motivation to move out sooner", "NTA. That\u2019s cute she doesn\u2019t own the home and thinks she gets a say. She\u2019s welcome to move out if she doesn\u2019t want you to have another dog.", "NTA, she\u2019s a guest, she doesn\u2019t get to make rules in your house.
