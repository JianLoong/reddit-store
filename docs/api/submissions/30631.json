Is there s different belt or dress you\u2019d rather wear since the belt isn\u2019t working\u201d. But no, you immediately attacked her weight gain. If you were having such an issue with it then you should have sat her down and had a discussion with her. You let it fester and you definitely are the asshole for how,when and why you said it to her. 4 years is a long time and if you can\u2019t be honest with your her and discuss what\u2019s bothering you than maybe it\u2019s not the relationship for you. Yes weight gain is a sensitive topic, but you as her partner should know the ways to go about things with her delicately enough where this situation could have been avoided.", "YTA, what did you expect with those comments?", "YTA. Does your girlfriend has some mental impairment that prevents her from noticing she's gained weight? Because that's how you're treating her. \"How many cookies ago\" isn't funny or helpful.", "YTA\n\nYou could've said that it was time to get another belt or tell her that the belt wouldn't fit and ask her what she wanted to do and be supportive of her choice, but you decided to make awful comments about her.\n\n>I'm not a psychologist or whatever at all, but, I've noticed she still tries to dress like her thin friends and wear the outfits they do.\n\nAlso, wth? There's no a \"thin\" and a \"fat\" way to dress.

It doesn't matter if it was the \"heat of the moment\", because those were your true or deep feelings.", "YTA. And she was right, you are a dick for saying what you said. You don't get to be frustrated about someone else's body. You could have said \"it doesn't work, this belt is too small.\". And telling her it is diet time was entirely out of line. You can say \"You have gained weight\", but not what she should do about it.", "YTA. She is absolutely right, you were definitely a dick. It\u2019s never okay to comment on a person\u2019s weight, and you did it in a way that was cruel and mocking. \n\nIf your first instinct when frustrated is to be unnecessarily cruel, I hope for her sake she reconsiders this relationship.", "YTA\n\nWhat a maroon.", "I'm not sure this is even real but dude, clearly YTA. You don't know how to communicate worth a damn, you're completely unobservant, and you seem like the type who feels only their opinion matters, or at least is more important.

There's a difference between genuine commenting (\"did you put on some weight?\" Yeah it's rhetorical but at least you let your gf the choice to answer) and being mean, like with your \"it's diet time\" and \"how many cookies\". My dude, that's just not how you convince someone to lose weight - if anything that's how you break their self-confidence and convince them to not loose weight at all. Also, diet culture is harmful since it relies on privation, which means that as soon as you stop the diet, the weight come back. Apologize and if she expresses the need to lose weight (and she can chose not too, if she likes herself how she is), then you tell her to hit the gym with you\n\nI assume your gf doesn't have ED but if she did, your comment alone could have done more harm than good.

This must be rage bait.\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 how many insults ago did you notice you might the TA?\n\nYTA. And if she feels comfortable wearing whatever, let her.

If you resort to hurting someone else's feelings because of your own frustration, especially the one you are supposed to love, then you could  (in the least) have narcissistic tendencies. Look into it, dude. It might save many people years of pain and frustration.", "YTA - I'd like to know something (no it won't change my opinion, but I wanna see how far this goes) how much does she weigh now?\n\nRegardless of the answer, you were mean.

No one talks like that to the person they love, frustrated or not.", "Do you care about your girlfriend at all? What a horrible and callous thing to say to a person. I can't imagine talking to my fiance that way. There are better ways to approach the subject, if at all.\n\n Major YTA.", ">how many cookies ago was that?\n\nWTF? Of all the ways you could've gone about bringing this up, that was definitely one of the most asshole ways possible. You say your comments were made out of frustration but it's pretty clear from the beginning of your post how much you resent your girlfriend's weight.

You are young so take it as a chance to learn at least", "YTA - How could you even think for a second that you weren\u2019t in this situation?? The way you spoke to her was vile. She deserves better.", "YTA. I get the message but delivery was not cool \ud83d\ude02", "YTA, not for commenting on her weight, but for how you're going about it. isn't she your girlfriend? couldn't you bring this up in a more respectful manner?", "YTA. There are other ways you could have brought this up. It would be one thing if your relationship were at the level where you could be open to conversation, but you said you didn't want to start that fire. Just because you said sorry does not take away the consequences of what you said in a heated moment nor does it take away her pain.", "YTA, she deserves better.", "You were tactless, but I don't see why everyone is calling you out.

You didn\u2019t comment on her weight from a place or concern for her physical or mental health- you made comments a high school mean girl would come up with. You were cruel for absolutely no reason.

You could have addressed the situation later, and in a kind manner.\n\nThis is your girlfriend and you should be able to discuss things freely, but my word. The way you talked to her was so cruel and demeaning. Most fat people know they\u2019re fat and don\u2019t need reminding.

Let me take over some of the cooking, and I'll pack you lunch for work. Let's both focus on veggies and give up alcohol for a bit.'\n- 'Since we're both in our 20s now and I want to enjoy our lives together for the longest time possible, why don't we make time to sit and talk about things that may have an impact on our health longer term and see how we can build in some routine improvements? Habits now will make our middle age easier'\n\nNotice how none of them are about the aesthetic of a weight gain or couched in terms that would make her feel uncomfortable or insecure. Notice how none of these are just before you go for a special night out. Notice how none of these are about your girlfriend slipping up but are about your behaviours as a couple. Notice how none of these suggest an impact on your desire or love for her or the idea that you might feel shame being seen with her. \n\nA couple should be able to bring up things like weight gain, but any partner should be more concerned about their partner's health - mental and physical! - than their clothes.

My wife told me that I was picking up some pounds. \"Must be the football snacks\". I did not cry about it. I said you know what you are right.  I went on a diet and to the gym.
