She had known about me losing my grandmother, so she wanted to take me out to eat, to \u201cGet me out of the depression I was in\u201d. She said it was her treat, so I was sold! \n\nShe takes me to a local steakhouse. I see the steaks as soon as you walk in, ready to be picked out. We go to order, and she orders a salad. I order an 8 oz T-Bone, cooked Medium Rare. As soon as I say that, I hear an \u201cugh\u201d, from her. \n\nWhen the waitress leaves, I look at her and ask her what\u2019s up? She informs me that she has recently became a vegan, not because of allergies or anything, she just thinks that \u201cvegan is a healthier lifestyle\u201d, and that she couldn\u2019t believe that I ordered a steak. \n\nI gave her this \u201cWhat the Bleep?!\u201d Look, and she responds with, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d \n\nUm, you took me to a steakhouse. You can\u2019t possibly expect me to go along with your vegan diet in a freaking steakhouse, can you?! Well, that upset her(which, I do get, I came across as a little bit of an Asshole there), but then, when our food arrived, she was visibly annoyed with how much my steak was dripping from the juices. I offered to have it boxed up, to enjoy it once I was out of her presence, but she was like, \u201cNo, you ordered it to eat here, you might as well.\u201d \n\nAs I was cutting into it and everything, she kept on giving me this look of pure disgust, until I finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I looked at her, and point blank asked her, if she has such a problem with me eating meat, then maybe I should pay for my food, and my own ride back, and she could pay for hers and leave. She did so, left, and she hasn\u2019t talked to me since.

Honestly what is wrong with her lmao \n\nfirst of all, how can she take you to a steakhouse and then get offended that you order a steak? How was she bothered by YOUR steak and not everyone else's? I understand if she wanted to take you to a vegan place since she was paying and you threw a fit, but she chose the steakhouse apparently. \n\nsecondly, your diet is your choice, and your choice alone. If she is bothered that is her problme to fix, not yours.", "NTA\nSeriously this is ridiculous. Sounds like they did you a favor by leaving.

This was about doing something to make YOU happy when you were upset. If you wanted steak, then steak it is.\n\nThird, yeah I agree. Taking you to a steakhouse and expecting you to get salad is silly. If she specifically wanted you to order vegan then she should have taken you to a vegan specific restaurant. They exist and they are pretty tasty to people who aren't afraid of vegetables. Though again, this was a meal for cheering you up, so it would have needed to be ok with you to go to a specialized restaurant like that.\n\nFourth, it's not really a \"treat\" of you end up having to pay for it yourself. Just like a gift isn't a gift if there's strings attached, the same logic applies here.\n\nFith, she only recently became vegan and she did it \"for health reasons\". She is not a long time vegan who made that decision because of animal cruelty. I highly doubt she is actually disgusted by meat at all. She's just playing up the \"preachy vegan\" card. Which is sad, because most of the vegans/vegetarians I have met really couldn't care less what other people eat.
