It sounds like MIL generally allows this behavior (it specifies that she lets the toddler take photos on her phone semi-regularly), so I don\u2019t really fault mom that the toddler thinks it\u2019s okay.

It\u2019s so cute!!\u201d) then just expect it to stop when it starts to bother them. My son had an obsession with my MIL\u2019s water bottle when he was about 2 because she would always share with him despite me offering him his own. Eventually I know she got a little tired of it BUT she created the situation. And she\u2019s got a degree/spent her whole career working with that age group so she knows better LOL (my husband and my boundary with our son is that my parents/in-laws are welcome to watch him - they both like to and are trustworthy - and we\u2019ll suggest they not do certain things but let them live with the sometimes negative consequences of spoiling their grandkid). \n\nAt that age, teaching kids is like training dogs - consistency really, really, really matters. It\u2019s absolutely possible to start teaching at the age \u201cthat\u2019s not ours!\u201d and redirect. BUT if it\u2019s been okay 10 times before with MIL, toddler is going to assume it\u2019s okay now just like if you feed your dog scraps from the table, they will keep begging.", "Really?

My parents are super authoritarian although really not yellers usually. Not too long ago my 3 yo kiddo was innocently playing and accidentally dropped a toy loudly while standing a few feet from my mom.

I ran from the other room and yelled her name basically to get her attention and once I had it told her to stop yelling at him. She then started yelling at me, which I\u2019m fine with, and eventually I helped her to calm down. It was an overreaction from her which required me to also \u2018overreact\u2019. Later she admitted she was super tired and got a shock from the noise when my kid dropped his toy which is why she yelled. I know she would not have freaked out like this normally.

Now that he's 2 we are more stern with these things. He'll be told no and if needed, yes I will hold him back while talking.\n\nHave you ever raised a kid lol? It's not like you can sit a 2 year old down and explain rules have changed.... sure you can try, but they won't understand. So for them, rules always suddenly change. That's how it goes.\n\nThe horror of seeing all these inexperienced people giving advice is just shocking.", "You're a teacher, that's different than a parent. \n\nI don't need to do better. My children are well behaved and actually listen to the word \"no\".\n\nAnd lets get real, just because you're a teacher doesn't mean you know better. Heck, currently we know that the biggest danger to bad upbringing of our children is actually teachers..", "A stern voice is recommended so the toddler knows it's wrong what they are doing. I guess OP is so lenient that the kid isn't used to a no or a stern voice at all. Who is ok with their child grabbing phones and running around with them?", "You don't have children or been around children.", "Ummmmm\u2026 as an adult, if you grabbed someone\u2019s phone and ran off with it, that would be classed as stealing? Which is a punishable offence. Weird comparison to draw but okay\u2026\n\nOP has every right to protect her child\u2026 OP also needs to explain to her child that grabbing someone else\u2019s belonging and running off with it, isn\u2019t okay.", "I'm a mother myself and yes, you can teach children that age to not grab ihrer people's belongings and run away with them. You can teach one year olds not to touch things. People should try it.\n\nAnd grabbing the T shirt to stop her from taking off with the phone is not manhandling. FIL is probably not agile enough to run after her.", "Oh wow! I would love to meet such a 1 year old who knows that.", "Agreed on the child should not be running with the phone.\nSome parents seem to have trouble forseeing dangers of toddlers running around with things they are not supposed to be running with, in hand. Example of 1 case, a toddler was running around with a small cultured drink bottle, with a metal straw in it. This toddler, as all toddlers do, falls. Unfortunately she falls head first onto the metal straw, which goes through her eye and into her brain. \nThe Doctors could not save her.", "I have kids myself, yes they can learn that at that age. Parents just don't try because they think they are too young.", "#1 because you put the number sign first", "Not in the slightest. OP asked if she was TA for yelling\u2026 I took that quite literally, OP didn\u2019t like her grandfather yelling so she shouldn\u2019t either.\n\nI haven\u2019t at all sat here and said \u201cyour grandfather is correct in his actions\u201d. Have I? Please tell me where I have if I have done that.\nIf I was OP I would have my taken my daughter AWAY from their grandfather and not let them see them again.. that\u2019s what I did when my dad to it to my son?\nTook my son away from my dad, made sure my son was okay and then went back into the room to tell my dad that\u2019s unacceptable and he will never see his grandson again.", "Just a heads up, OP admitted in a comment that the FIL grabbed the shirt as the child was running away to stop the kid leaving with the phone, not picking the kid up by the shirt or twisting on purpose to cause pain like it suggests in the post.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that happened to you", "Honestly that's super fair. I don't have a mom, but my dad has always been super protective of me. In my own opinion based on my experience, I've always felt much safer with my dad and knowing he'll protect me when I need it. The mom yelling probably scared the kid even more, I'll give you that.", "I\u2019m sorry is gramps a stranger?", "She thinks people don't care, but they clearly do or it wouldn't have happened.", "How does one simply almost drop a child into a bonfire?", "I think I was being too optimistic. Yeah. :(", "Again, nothing indicates any of that at all. Not to mention, zero indication of not having boundaries or discipline.", "you're making a fuck load of assumptions that aren't necessarily supported by the text in the post", "literally none of this is an excuse for practically assaulting a toddler though", "How many 2 year-olds have you parented? Because saying they should know better than to grab things and run off with them is laughable. Two year olds are still putting everything in their mouths.", "You\u2019re an actual idiot. Grabbing your kids by their shirts to pull them around and yelling \u201cno\u201d at them is parenting? Good. Fucking. God. Get an education.\n\nETA: any of you who thinks that\u2019s parenting, turn yourself into CPS - you\u2019re fucking pathetic.", "Sure, rules change, but it's never fair to get mad at someone for breaking a rule you just changed without telling them. You have to teach them the new rule before you can possibly justify being cross at them for not following it.", "he's hiding something on his wife's phone?", "Just because you're a mommy doesn't mean you know shit.", "Let\u2019s get real, just because you popped the kid out doesn\u2019t mean you know better than someone with a decade of experience and an actual, formal education on development.\n\nGo lick your wounds and treat your kids better. Do. Better.", "And the toddler sees this as a game... even if they don't get to keep the item, they get the payoff of having a run and chase with an adult. YTA OP. I've worked as a nanny and caught numerous children by their shirts. Sounds like your daughter struggled and that's how her straps got twisted up, so that's her own fault.", "i have an 8 month old. \n\ni swear,  she's massive leaps and bounds more mentally developed than she was at 5 months.", "Consistency, repetition, patience and time with your child.", "Exactly. I had friends who knew a couple who let their toddler run around with the toothbrush in her mouth. Tripped and fell, toothbrush went down her throat and destroyed her vocal cords.", "Thanks!", "Thank you for saying that. I feel a lot of people have misinterpreted what I meant by how I\u2019ve perceived this - the FIL is wrong he shouldn\u2019t have grabbed the daughter but the mum should have stepped in, protected her daughter and told her FIL what he did was wrong and if he does it again, he won\u2019t be allowed around the daughter.\n\nEveryone is different and peoples experiences in life will affect how they are in theirs, that\u2019s why I found everything about this wrong (OP and FIL)\u2026 and for me this kid has had two parental figures be aggressive in her direct vicinity\u2026 no wonder the poor love was scared.", "You missed the part where I said what is next? A child goes from family and friends to strangers because the child believes the behavior is ok.", "Drop? No. \n\nChild wandering around adults and older cousin sees him moving towards where the marshmallows were roasting and leaning forward therefore getting grabbed by the back of the shirt\u2026 he probably would have slid down into the fire.", "More likely the child was running around, tripped, and almost fell in.", "Well, OP wrote the post and thinks it's all fine and her FIL was suddenly wildly overreacting.\n\nSmall kids do awful things to fragile bits of technology. They don't mean to but they have no awareness of being careful with things unless they're taught. They can drop them in water or mud, they can put sticky fingers all over them, they can run into things while holding them.\n\nI've never seen a situation where someone's okay with a toddler going off unsupervised with their phone. OP doesn't say that FIL regularly grabs the baby so that suggests his behaviour was out of character. \n\nGiven that OP didn't actually run over to help/ rescue the phone/ remove his hands from her kid but stayed where she was and shouted, it seems she was more concerned with making a fuss than actually helping anyone. It's part of learning to be a parent -- that you need to be right there with little kids -- so it seems pretty likely that OP is quite hands off, which can be deeply frustrating to other people.", "The child walked up to someone, grabbed their thing and tried to run off without OP intervening.\nThat's the definition of not having discipline.", "of course the OP isn't going to bring that stuff up. why is a 2 year old grabbing anyone's phones it's certainly not for taking pictures which has to be a lie.  I agree with the guy reading between the lines. Not that it excuses the violent behavior but come on 2 year olds and expensive prices of tech famously don't get Along and kids that age probably shouldn't even know what a cell phone is", "They should be taught and they can be taught at that age. They won't get it right every time, but it is possible to teach them. Parents just don't start to teach.", "I've got one of those, thank you. OP is not a reliable narrator, it was probably not yelling but a stern voice and he was stopping her from running off not pulling her around.", "He just yelled no? Why are we acting like he went on a full rant? \n\nThis was part of teaching the new rule... It's becoming clearer and clearer to me the more you react.", "Daddy*", "I would be a medical wonder if I popped out a child. \n\nI have no wounds to lick? But maybe you can help me with the pain in my stomach from laughing at you?", "It's a redditor moment fr", "No no. Please tell me you know an actual 1 year old who is knowledgeable on this.", "Okay Beverly Goldberg.", "NP. It\u2019s a common enough thing", "She is old enough not just to be redirected but old enough to listen to a stern no. Looks like the parents haven't taught her no though.", "Wow, what a moron! I cant believe that child doesnt have self preservation", "Well if that were true - that's why we WALK when we are around fires, kids.  No running! And parents, watch your kids around fires!\n\nSorry for being condescending, I am very passionate about fire safety.\n\nBut the situation was explained, and running/tripping was not the issue.", "why would it be a lie that a 2 year old likes to play on phones? that seems super normal.", "Snagging the t shirt to stop the toddler and a stern voice are not violent behaviour. I guess OP is an unreliable narrator.", "im sorry but this is insane. \n\nthe kid was completely allowed to do what she was doing up until that moment. if FIL didnt want her to use MIL\u2019s phone anymore, there were at least five ways he couldve gone about it that wouldnt be this intense. this reaction was completely unnecessary and was absolutely an AH move. \n\nyou just cant treat a child like that for breaking a rule that didnt exist five seconds ago unless their life is literally in danger.", "My kids are teens now, so a bit too late for that.\n\nPeople often make the mistake that kids are too young to learn, especially if they don't speak yet, and don't actually try. But kids understand language way before they speak it and are not stupid, they can usually learn a lot more that you think. It is not instant though and needs consistency and repeating again and again, similar to how you train a dog. Parents just don't try.", "It honestly wasn\u2019t really hot anymore. Fire was almost gone. If I remember right, he was reaching for the sticks where they put the marshmallows or hung the bbq sticks where the marshmallows were.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while, he\u2019s in his mid 30s now.", "I kept tripping over my feet/pantholes as a kid even more when walking. I was a very clumsy kid", "Sure there were other ways, but this doesn't make him an immediate AH. \n\nAlso, she says \"screams\" and I really, really doubt this. If he really screamed the rest of the family would be in awe too. What probably happened is he told her no and she was shocked by the grabbing and made this a whole big thing when almost nothing actually happened.", "Goodness, they're already full!", "Wow that is small! I was 3lb so like 30% bigger and my skin was translucent, since I hadn't been putting any fat on you could see all my organs and stuff! I also was an absolute monkey, I climbed everything, I had gymnastics coaches at 3 who wanted me to do 30+ hours of training a week. Fun fact I then had a febrile seizure and had to be put in an induced coma when I was like 2/3yrs old and it was literally like movie timing, the doctor was in the process of telling my parents that IF I woke up I would have brain damage and my mum literally just falls to the ground sobbing as I just pipe in with 'whose brain damaged?' and everyone in the room just turn to look at me just sitting there happily.", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0d"]}
