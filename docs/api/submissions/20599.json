You had every right to yell at him for being aggressive towards your child. You are her best advocate. For people saying the child should know better than to touch other people\u2019s belongings, she is not even 2 yet!", ">My daughter started crying in a way I have never heard her cry before, I think because she was scared.\n\nWell two adults were yelling at each other. It's normal to be scared of something like that. She's also not even two years old. They're emotional little teacup humans. \n\nYou need to teach your daughter not to take things that don't belong to her. FIL shouldn't have grabbed her. You shouldn't have yelled either. \n\nESH", ">he is aggressively grabbing my daughter by the straps of her tank top with his hand twisted around them trying to grab the phone back.\n\nUnless your child was in immediate danger (which she wasn't), it's crazy that a grown man got THIS physical with a less than 2 year old child.

That is so not how you enforce boundaries or discipline a child. If he was that upset about your daughter grabbing the phone, it\u2019s not that hard to get down to her level and either talk to her like a human being, or gently take it out of her hand. \nHe put hands on your kid, the fact that all you did was tell him to stop is impressive.

Your daughter is a toddler but you need to work with her more to NOT grab phones.  Grandma is fine with it, grandpa is not, that is confusing to her, but she shouldn't be grabbing them up.", "Nta, you stated mil doesn\u2019t care your toddler grabs her phone.

You for not teaching your daughter to not grab things that aren\u2019t hers, and for yelling at FIL.  FIL for yelling at toddler. \n\nYou need to realize not everyone is going to be okay with your child grabbing things that aren\u2019t theirs and are expensive. You need to start teaching your daughter \u201cno, that\u2019s not yours.\u201d My toddler (14 months) is slowly learning that boundary through repeated redirection and keeping his toys in his grab range and keeping our stuff away from him.", "NTA\n\nBut the daughter was possibly more frightened by your response.\n\nStill it\u2019s your kid and if this type of behaviour doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with you, you are okay to express that.", "YTA\n\nShould your FIL done that? No. should you have reacted the way you did, also no. Kids feed off their parents\u2019 reactions and if you make a bid deal out of something like this or them falling they will react to your reaction and the the precipitating event. It sounds like you toddler cried because you scared them with your reaction.", "NTA. If your daughter is crying from what he did, it probably hurt. If your family doesn\u2019t see that, they are in the wrong. Besides, what was worse: yelling at a family member, or potentially hurting a child?", "YTA, you absolutely overrated and are reinforcing terrible behavior in your child", "ESH. It was very wrong of your FIL to yell at her but you ended up doing the same thing to him where as you could have said the same thing in a different manner, you should remember that a child is affected by seeing their parents, relatives and family members yelling at each other as much as they are affected by someone yelling at them.", "People need to start taking responsibility.  Kid needs to be taught not to just grab things off the table. What if it had been a hot cup of coffee? Who's at fault then?  Maybe he's sick of your kid freely grabbing stuff it shouldn't and never being told no.", "YTA.\n\nTrain your child to leave other people's property alone. I'm sick of modern day parents who expect other adults to put up with their brats.\n\nHe didn't cause permanent damage, & she learned a valuable lesson.\n\nBring on the downvotes, permissive wimps.", "ESH. You because you haven\u2019t taught your daughter not to grab things and him for aggressively grabbing her", "NAH, It's a generational difference. Children used to be disciplined differently 20 years ago, probably even 10 years ago. I'm going to sound really old now, but when I was a child, I knew I had done wrong when I was doing something I shouldn't because I was shouted at properly and disciplined appropriately. Children need to be taught properly right and wrong, and that is all FIL was trying to do, he might have gone about it the wrong way though.", "FIL is the Certifiable ASSHOLE!", "ESH", "NTA", "are the comments actually expecting a 20 months old toddler to understand not to touch something that doesn\u2019t belong to him? Obvious NTA", "She\u2019s a  2 year old so obviously she is gonna reach for this that\u2019s the stage where it\u2019s being introduced. Yes OP should\u2019ve said something, but if the MIL doesn\u2019t care of course OP isn\u2019t going to say anything. No FIL should\u2019ve be \u201cjacking up\u201d a child let alone a toddler!! If I seen someone grab my toddler in that manner me aggressively saying your name would be the least of your problems. \nNTA!", "This is a little unfair. It sounds like MIL generally allows this behavior (it specifies that she lets the toddler take photos on her phone semi-regularly), so I don\u2019t really fault mom that the toddler thinks it\u2019s okay. As a mom of a 4YO, one thing that can be eye rolling is when grandparents are permissive of a certain behavior (\u201cdon\u2019t, worry it\u2019s okay! It\u2019s so cute!!\u201d) then just expect it to stop when it starts to bother them. My son had an obsession with my MIL\u2019s water bottle when he was about 2 because she would always share with him despite me offering him his own. Eventually I know she got a little tired of it BUT she created the situation. And she\u2019s got a degree/spent her whole career working with that age group so she knows better LOL (my husband and my boundary with our son is that my parents/in-laws are welcome to watch him - they both like to and are trustworthy - and we\u2019ll suggest they not do certain things but let them live with the sometimes negative consequences of spoiling their grandkid). \n\nAt that age, teaching kids is like training dogs - consistency really, really, really matters. It\u2019s absolutely possible to start teaching at the age \u201cthat\u2019s not ours!\u201d and redirect. BUT if it\u2019s been okay 10 times before with MIL, toddler is going to assume it\u2019s okay now just like if you feed your dog scraps from the table, they will keep begging.", "Really? You're talking about a 2.5 y/o kid, they still have so much to learn. What a shit take, I'd yell too if I saw someone manhandling my toddler like that! \n\nWhat should she have done? Whisper; 'FIL if you have the time, could you please release my child?'", "I agree. Daughter needs to start learning not to grab other people's things, and people need to be consistent with this, MIL.  Phones are not toys. FIL should not have touched her. I can understand OP being concerned that FIL was hurting daughter.", "he grabbed her as she was walking away and he doubled down by wrapping the straps around his hand. It seemed aggressive at the time.", "He would\u2019ve hurt her if he grabbed her body. OP confirmed he wasn\u2019t jacking her up. He caught her before she did what her toddler mind wanted.\n\nWhich could be anything.", ">he is aggressively grabbing my daughter by the straps of her tank top with his hand twisted around them trying to grab the phone back.\n\nDid you miss that part? The straps were likely digging into the toddler's underarms and shoulders as well", "Well one of them is only 21 months old\u2026", "She said that if he'd asked nicely, she would have helped redirect her daughter/discipline/get the phone back/etc. No 21 month old is going to already have that kind of impulse control, though.", "Boundaries for a 21 month old?\n\nIf only it was that easy\u2026", "But the MIL/grandmother is allowing it and created the situation. So mom could totally be teaching her kid this while MIL continues to be permissive.", "21 months is not even 2 yo", "21 months is not even 2 yo", "That's BS.  My 2 year-old grandson knows when he is told \"No!\" to immediately put down whatever he has picked up. And he is autistic to boot.\n\nOP didn't need to yell either.  She could have dealt with the situation much better but instead chose to make a scene that ended up scaring her child.", "NAH. \n\nHe caught her as she was running away with the phone which is why nobody else reacted. I think he grabbed the shirt to not hurt her. No yanking those little limbs while they run the other way. I\u2019ve grabbed toddler shirts before scooping them up by the waist to get pennies, keys, whatever toddlers find interesting at the moment. I use a stern voice to say \u201cNo, that\u2019s not okay.\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d I don\u2019t speak gently because I want them to know little one, this is dangerous; don\u2019t do it again. They usually cry.\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH because you saw after the fact and you\u2019re rightfully scared/upset. If you see your baby uncomfortable/crying who in the moment who expects you to pause and assess the scene.", "I understand. Boundaries are boundaries and if you set them in place, you also have to instill them as well\u2026\nI too don\u2019t condone shouting around my 3 year old and I\u2019ve been met with similar situations. I\u2019ve taken my child out of the situation I didn\u2019t like them being in, made sure they were okay and then spoke to the persons whose behaviour I didn\u2019t like.", "You realize children learn boundaries by you starting young and continually enforcing them as their brains develop, right? \n\nSaying \u201cno\u201d when she reaches for something she shouldn\u2019t have is age appropriate.\n\nSo is telling your MIL to stop giving her the phone.\n\nNo one said parenting a toddler is easy lol", "Then mom needs to put her foot down and parent. That\u2019s what being a mom means.", "Is 3 months that big a difference?\n\nI'm legitimately asking, I'm not usually around humans that small", "Your 2-year old grandson probably responds to \"No\" *most* of the time. There is absolutely no way any 2 year old immediately responds to \"No\" 100% of the time without fail. It's developmentally impossible. Do you plan to rough him up when he inevitably fails around you?", "He's probably not responding to \"no,\" just reacting to the noise level.", "This is a little different if someone is physically handling your child in a manner you don\u2019t approve of.\n\nAlso your reasoning in the first comment is different than your next comment.", "Yes\u2026I have children.\n\nBabies do not learn cause and effect generally until around 2-3 years of age.\n\nBoundaries are incredibly difficult to teach especially when you have external adults in the mix.\n\nHence why I said, if it was only that easy\u2026\n\nYou need to calm down a bit, pretty aggressive response.", "*Sometimes* being a mom is letting the grandparents spoil the grandkids (within reason/if you have a decent relationship) and reap the silly consequences of their own actions. LOL Because parenting (and life) is also about picking your battles.", "Yeah, the brain develops in massive leaps at these ages. There are some really cool apps that track the \"leaps\" in brain development, and give you a heads up regarding any behaviour/irritation the toddler may be experiencing as a result. Even a month can make a big difference. Its a really interesting rabbit hole to go down", "It can be, but not necessarily.", "lol I wasn\u2019t trying to be aggressive, truly.\n\nBut 21 months is old enough to be told \u201cno\u201d. They\u2019re not being punished by taking the phone away. \n\nI\u2019m aware of neurological development and believe in gentle parenting and also think it\u2019s okay to start priming your kid to understand boundaries as their brains develop.", "She definitely can but it\u2019s not a solution to this issue at hand.\n\nSounds like you have kids, and I\u2019m sure know what tends to happen when people outside the core homestead are part of the social mix.\n\nYour condescending tone to myself and the OP isn\u2019t helpful."]}
