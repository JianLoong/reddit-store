It sounds like MIL generally allows this behavior (it specifies that she lets the toddler take photos on her phone semi-regularly), so I don\u2019t really fault mom that the toddler thinks it\u2019s okay. As a mom of a 4YO, one thing that can be eye rolling is when grandparents are permissive of a certain behavior (\u201cdon\u2019t, worry it\u2019s okay! It\u2019s so cute!!\u201d) then just expect it to stop when it starts to bother them. My son had an obsession with my MIL\u2019s water bottle when he was about 2 because she would always share with him despite me offering him his own. Eventually I know she got a little tired of it BUT she created the situation. And she\u2019s got a degree/spent her whole career working with that age group so she knows better LOL (my husband and my boundary with our son is that my parents/in-laws are welcome to watch him - they both like to and are trustworthy - and we\u2019ll suggest they not do certain things but let them live with the sometimes negative consequences of spoiling their grandkid). \n\nAt that age, teaching kids is like training dogs - consistency really, really, really matters. It\u2019s absolutely possible to start teaching at the age \u201cthat\u2019s not ours!\u201d and redirect. BUT if it\u2019s been okay 10 times before with MIL, toddler is going to assume it\u2019s okay now just like if you feed your dog scraps from the table, they will keep begging.", "Really?

My parents are super authoritarian although really not yellers usually. Not too long ago my 3 yo kiddo was innocently playing and accidentally dropped a toy loudly while standing a few feet from my mom. She screamed his name and started yelling at him over and over again while he cowered. I ran from the other room and yelled her name basically to get her attention and once I had it told her to stop yelling at him. She then started yelling at me, which I\u2019m fine with, and eventually I helped her to calm down. It was an overreaction from her which required me to also \u2018overreact\u2019. Later she admitted she was super tired and got a shock from the noise when my kid dropped his toy which is why she yelled. I know she would not have freaked out like this normally.

Don't poke a momma bear.", "It's her job as a parent to watch and reinforce, not wait for someone to complain", "\ud83d\ude02 your comment is hilarious. \n\nYes, boundaries. Tell them \u201cno\u201d or \u201cthat is not yours\u201d. Oh it\u2019s easy. I have a toddler that is 1 year and 9 months and I tell him \u201cno\u201d and \u201cthat is not yours\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t touch that\u201d ALL the time. He gets upset and throws a fit sometimes but he listens. Since he\u2019s been more mobile and able to reach things on tables he knows what\u2019s his and what isn\u2019t, if it\u2019s his he will grab it and I will let him but if it isn\u2019t his he touches it with his pointer finger and then looks at me if I say yes or no. Toddlers are smarter than you think. Maybe give your toddler a little more credit and make some boundaries. \ud83d\ude09 assuming you have a toddler from your comment. \n\nBut I really am extremely confused by \u201cif only it was that easy\u2026\u201d Well it is! Let the toddler throw a fit. When they get older they won\u2019t be grabbing other things like food from a strangers plate or a phone from a strangers table because you told them \u201cno\u201d when they were taking grandmas phone from the table without grandma specifically giving it to them.", "They ignored it because it didn\u2019t support their claims.", "We have no clue how twisted it was.    If you're against yelling, you don't model yelling", "I would agree that it is a understandable reaction from OP, but her yelling would have added to how upset her daughter was. FIL probably deserved to be yelled at but it didnt help the situation.", "One year old, but spot on otherwise", "That term is fine to use.", "Yes. If they are old enough to grab, they are old enough to start teaching. Gently, of course.", "[deleted]", "Ty", "Are you yelling at and manhandling him, which is the issue here? The kid wasnt *told* no. She was doing something she does frequently and is *allowed* to do and FIL responded by shouting at her and yanking her back by the *shirt*, which is incredibly threatening and likely painful for a *two year old*.", "Tell me you TTUAC without telling me you TTUAC.", "Yes, but when parents try to do this other people, specially grandparents, tend to say 'oh, it's fine! Let them!' and the child gets used to it, as it seems it has happened here.", "I disagree. Human children are not dogs.", "But it is, though. Thats exactly what its a matter of. You dont get to tell and grab children just because *you* dont like them doing something they are *allowed* to do. Also, shes 21 months old- she wasnt going to sprint out the room with it. That was a completely unnecessary reaction when just *telling* her to not take the phone wouldve sufficed.\n\nEdit: also, its a completely reasonable response to yell at an adult if you think theyre hurting your child. Unless your protecting them from hurting themselves (which he wasnt), there *isnt* a valid reason to react like that", "It was mil's phone and she had always let her take it before, not his.", "Yeah, thats why people use months over years at that age. 12 months is a baby whos only just learning how to sit and stand up. 24 months is a whole (very small) human who can run around, sort of hold conversations, climb on stuff, manage some fine motor skills etc etc. they make *huge* leaps and bounds at this age", "2.5 years = 30 months 30-21 = 9 months. But, yes. Either way yes.", "Yes, it's a HUGE difference!  Lol", "Yes, three months at that stage can be huge.", "I mean, a child abused will shut down and respond 100% of the time, but it isn't self control it's fear and nothing for care providers to be proud of.", "what does TTUAC mean?  I've never seen this initialism and Google has no idea, either.", "Hence the need to begin early setting and reinforcing boundaries. Yep, it's difficult. Nope, it's not impossible. \nMIL is also at fault. Might be helpful to put the phone out of reach of the toddler. FIL is a jackass.", "*boundaries are incredibly difficult to teach unless external adults in the mix agree on the boundaries and help reinforce those boundaries. \n\nIf you are the parent you need to let those \u201cexternal adults\u201d know the boundaries you have set for the toddler. That\u2019s why there\u2019s adults and toddlers. \ud83d\ude09", "Not when it comes to things that do not belong to the child. Will mommy dearest pay to fix MIL\u2019s phone if precious darling breaks it? Probably not because \u201cshe\u2019s only 21 months\u201d. Aka old enough to redirect", "Ah that's a great explanation of something that's always eluded me. I have no experience with very young children and I never could understand why the month thing was so prevalent.  This explains it beautifully.", "Umm yesss! My DD was born at 26weeks. 3 months early. She walked at the size of a 10 month old. She scared people for a few years.", "I think it\u2019s \u201cTo Train Up A Child\u201d a child abuse handbook that some (many?) fundamentalist Christians follow, such as the Duggar family.", "You recognise that he didnt say no, right? He yelled and grabbed her? And very clearly scared her, which is understandable when she got such an unexpected response to something she was *allowed to do*.", "Yeah, i remember when i studied it in high school and it just *clicked* lol. Before that the only explanation id seen was someone claiming it was about clothing sizes. It made a lot more sense once i realised how big a difference a couple months makes in what they can do.", "So to fully spell out their comment, they were saying \"Tell me you To Train Up A Child without telling me you To Train Up A Child\"?  That actually makes LESS sense lol"]}
