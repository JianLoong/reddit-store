It sounds like MIL generally allows this behavior (it specifies that she lets the toddler take photos on her phone semi-regularly), so I don\u2019t really fault mom that the toddler thinks it\u2019s okay.

It\u2019s so cute!!\u201d) then just expect it to stop when it starts to bother them. My son had an obsession with my MIL\u2019s water bottle when he was about 2 because she would always share with him despite me offering him his own. Eventually I know she got a little tired of it BUT she created the situation. And she\u2019s got a degree/spent her whole career working with that age group so she knows better LOL (my husband and my boundary with our son is that my parents/in-laws are welcome to watch him - they both like to and are trustworthy - and we\u2019ll suggest they not do certain things but let them live with the sometimes negative consequences of spoiling their grandkid). \n\nAt that age, teaching kids is like training dogs - consistency really, really, really matters. It\u2019s absolutely possible to start teaching at the age \u201cthat\u2019s not ours!\u201d and redirect. BUT if it\u2019s been okay 10 times before with MIL, toddler is going to assume it\u2019s okay now just like if you feed your dog scraps from the table, they will keep begging.", "Really?

A 2 1/2 year old child is old enough to start learning not to touch other peoples things, especially things that break easily.

My parents are super authoritarian although really not yellers usually. Not too long ago my 3 yo kiddo was innocently playing and accidentally dropped a toy loudly while standing a few feet from my mom.

I ran from the other room and yelled her name basically to get her attention and once I had it told her to stop yelling at him. She then started yelling at me, which I\u2019m fine with, and eventually I helped her to calm down. It was an overreaction from her which required me to also \u2018overreact\u2019. Later she admitted she was super tired and got a shock from the noise when my kid dropped his toy which is why she yelled. I know she would not have freaked out like this normally. Anyway, if someone physically grabbed my kid like that to correct their behavior, I would definitely stop it by whatever means including yelling.", "Absolutely NTA.

Guess it's time for the toddler bed. \n\nEvery day he learns new things, it's amazing to watch, though about half of his new tricks are mischief, and a quarter of them are ridiculous.", "\u201cNever said I did.\u201d\n\nWhat? What are you referring to? Are you responding to the correct person?", "She says in the title that he yelled, and in the post that he grabbed her. Both of those are out of line given the kid was a) not doing anything dangerous, and b) doing something she\u2019s explicitely been told she can do by the MIL. And yeah, the kid was walking away. Shes also 21 months old. She wasnt at risk of sprinting out of the room with the it, a simple \u2018no, dont take the phone/put the phone back, now\u2019 wouldve sufficed. \n\nAlso they were at a family dinner. Im not surprised that FIL\u2019s family dont think hes wrong/wouldnt stop him. Behaviour like that is a) usually not a one off and b) doesnt come out of nowhere. It was probably not a surprise for them.", "Yeah, i forgot about the Secret Hidden Milestone they reach: developing spider-man-eque powers for 6-8 months out of nowhere, haha. \n\nI wish you luck- now that hes discovered these skills, youre going to have your hands full XD", "I was like that, I was induced 6 weeks premature due to not intaking nutrients so I was very small the nurses had to go buy cabbage patch dolls clothing bcos they didn't have anything that was small enough. It was really funny though because i was a tiny toddler and I was an early speaker anyway so I was about the size of a 10 month old but was talking in full sentences and I was dramatic and would never say I'm hungry or tired but that I was starving or exhausted. So anyway it meant that I looked about 10 months but was closer to 2 and so when I would run around talking people were soo shocked.", "Thanks for pointing out I dared to make a mistake.  \n\nI never said that human kids were dogs. There are many ways that \u201ctraining\u201d is used towards people in general. I listed plenty of examples of you bothered to read most of my previous comment instead of nitpicking my one mistake.", "Yes ! My baby girl was 1lb14oz and the day she came home she was 5lbs. At 6 mo she was in nb clothes. Her hospital clothes were all made by a company that works in NICU clothing. It's so amazing to see y'all laugh, walk, talk , eat and run after seeing you as babies. To us parents it's like y'all grow so so much but no one sees what we do on the daily lol. Tiny but mighty", "My daughter was/is small and not a premie, just small people, but she didnt talk until suddenly she did and it was definitely JUST like that. Dramatic and hilarious.", "I think it\u2019s more the idea of, \u201cTell me you follow To Train Up A Child ideology without telling me you follow To Train Up A Child ideology\u201d", "\"Tell me you (blank) without telling me you (blank)\" is a fairly common internet phrase.", "What is your problem?", "Lol yeah, that WASN'T the confusing part....", "The only person who seems to have an issue is you for not being able to admit when you are wrong. You\u2019d rather pick out a stupid mistake I made over actually responding to what I said about your incorrect statement about the word \u201ctrain\u201d being applied only to dogs and never to humans.", "I mean the rest makes sense so I don't know what to tell you lol", "I would give up. They are not going to admit they made a mistake.", "Go make a friend."]}
