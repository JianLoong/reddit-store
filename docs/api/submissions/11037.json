Now I didn't mind b/c she enjoyed doing and it wasn't affecting our relationship.\n\nThe past few years with covid and having 2 kids Sarah put a hold on the classes until this past year. She went back to school with my approval. What I didn't realize was how much extra work it would put on me. Basically, I took care of all household chores including cooking, cleaning, dropping the kids off and picking up. I have basically no free time of my own outside of when the kids fall asleep until I do.

I thought about the past year and asked her not to take the class. I explained the classes haven't been a good investment (no pay increase or career advancement) and now with the kids its too hard on me. Sarah thought this wasn't fair. That I keep her from advances her career and options. I explained after she got her current job she hasn't pushed for a raise or looked for a new job. It makes no sense for us to keep spending money and time now that we have 2 kids under 5. She has put a hold on classes but she isn't happy about it.

This sounds like an expensive hobby or social activity.", "NTA OP. Seriously", "NTA  \nYall need to sit down and figure out the financial costs of this. If she wants to go to school forever, then its time for her to pay for it herself. You might need to separate your finances and have a joint account that you both put into for the household bills.

I think it\u2019s a fair conversation to sit down and talk about time and energy and how to best divide that as a team.  Two kids under 5 is very demanding.  Good luck.", "NTA. Self improvement stuff like study and hobbies take a necessary back seat to parenting when you have very young children. Once the kids are both in school and able to take care of a lot of their day to day needs, you get a lot more time available to pursue personal interests. Young children are incredibly labour intensive. Until they can put themselves to bed, shower alone, make their own snacks and entertain themselves for long stretches, they have to be your top priority.\n\nIt sounds like she wants to engage in her hobby of studying (cause if it's not resulting in career advancement and she's not actively pursuing that, it's a hobby) the same as she did before kids and that's unrealistic. It's the same as people wanting to continue gaming for hours or going golfing every week. Taking care of present responsibilities trumps investing in this phase, but it's short and she can pick it back up when they need you both less. \n\nIt might be helpful to sit down and talk about the actual milestones that would signal its time to revisit the topic, e.g. possibly the ones I listed above as a starting point. I'm guessing her fear is that she'll never have that freedom and sense of achievement again and it's common for women to lose their identity in parenting, but it has to balance for everyone. Find out her fears, validate the sacrifices you're both having to make, look into carving out unicorn time to engage in your interests equitably while you ride out this high demand stage of parenthood. You might find the fair play method helpful, there's a documentary, book and card deck and it covers a really solid approach to problem solving this kind of situation", "NTA. \n\nUnderstanding that you make 3xs more that you\u2019ve been paying for her education but agree it\u2019s money not well spent.

As you\u2019ve said having 2 small children means a lot less free time, she isn\u2019t getting any benefits from all these classes in the form of a different job or promotion then I wouldn\u2019t say it is reasonable at this point she continues to do them, it\u2019s not fair to put so much more in to you.", "NTA the kids are young and a lot of work and you two are both working full time.

My grandma used to care for me and my brother when my mom was busy running her business.", "NTA, at some point you're just taking classes to take classes, and it should be treated like a hobby, the same as anything else. It's one thing to have an expensive and time-consuming hobby when you're a double-income no kids household; once you've got two toddlers, you both need to make sacrifices in order to be equally present.  \n\nTwo caveats: 1) this is assuming you're right that the classes really aren't going to change her career trajectory (eg, that she's not 3/4 of the credits through law school or something), and 2) this is taking you at your word that the current setup means that you'd consistently be asked to bear an unequal weight for the household (this is the kind of thing you need to be really introspective about, not try and score points on, because a non-zero number of men think that doing any childcare/chores constitutes 50-50 and the reality is that true 50-50 splits mean you have an equal amount of time off).", "NTA have a frank talk with her. She can resume her classes once kids are older . Right now, they are a handful and need help and attention. Might be when they are closer to ten. Also, have separate accounts for finances. And about helpers - your wife needs to get flexible about them. She also needs to do her share of the housework. What she exactly does can be discussed so that you are not GM feeling burdened. Are the classes a way out of getting out of doing housework?\nAlso, ask her about her plan/ goal  for taking classes. Why hasn\u2019t she gone for Masters instead of her third degree? If she is earning, why isn\u2019t she paying for her classes? Why isn\u2019t she trying to get her company to pay for it? \nIf she has no idea / reason , might be she needs a mentor to guide her. She can look into this actively and use it reflect / move towards her goals .", "You both have had full time jobs all along. What percentage of household chores and planning and child care were you responsible for prior to Sarah returning to classes? I'm guessing not very much, since you suddenly noticed it was a lot of work when she stopped doing it.  YTA .  Your real issue here isn't money or return on investment. It's that you suddenly had to step up and take care of the housework and the child care that your wife was doing, and you want her to take care of it instead of you. Suggest you outsource some of that work - hire a cleaning person, subscribe to a meal service that will do the meal planning & prep for you, etc. It's up to your wife whether she continues her education.

It doensnt help either.", "I don't think it would be temporary. Pre covid and kids was always enrolled in classes. I assumed there would be a break but she planned to enroll in more classes to start once these are done. I expect this to continue like it was previously.", "Op says elsewhere that wife refuses to have anyone in the house to help.", "Does she actually want to advance her career? Does she have an idea of what she wants? Is she also looking for a different job that could showcase her increased skillset? Staying in the same job forever but collecting degrees/diplomas/certificates could make her \"over qualified\" for jobs of her skillset and hold her back.\n\nSuddenly dumping everything on you isn't sustainable. But also, if you and your wife clean up after yourselves, who is cleaning up after the kids?\n\nAlternatively, if she enjoys the learning or social aspect, she could look into a less-consuming class, like art or cooking.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH. She should have a plan for how long she\u2019s going to be in school and that plan should be communicated to you. My issue with you is that you have no idea what\u2019s going on with your wife\u2019s educational goals. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because of a lack of interest on your part or a lack of transparency on her part but you shouldn\u2019t have asked her to put school on hold without finding out why she hasn\u2019t earned a degree yet. You basically said: \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see the fruits of your labor so stop taking classes. I\u2019ll let you know when I think it\u2019s an appropriate time for you to resume\u201d. That feels really controlling, even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way. \n\nThere is room for compromise here. Why not ask your wife if there are online classes available at her school? She could do that just for this semester to give you a bit of relief. You could also go over her transcripts with her to figure out how many more credits she needs to graduate and set a target date for finishing those credits. If your wife is no longer interested in earning a degree but she\u2019s enjoying learning new things, you can help her find way to do that without spending a lot of money and taking time away from the family.", ">Yearly its always over $10k up to $30k.\n\nWhat classes is she taking? I think NTA. That's a huge money expenditure for what? You've seen no raises, no job changes right? \n\nShe refuses helpers because she doesn't trust them. That's hilarious. No more wasted money and trying to make you take over more than 50% of the chores.", "If chores are 50/50, she won't let you get cleaners etc, she's not advancing her career or earning more money and you have little to no free time, then you seriously need to re-assess. Has she gotten any qualifications during that time period? Has she had to redo any semesters/years? \n\nAt this stage you've spent 100k on her continued education for her to earn the same amount. Tell her she can earn whatever qualifications she wants but she will solely be paying for them.", "What was the balance after kids? Chores before kids and chores after kids are two very different things.\n\nAnd before she started classes, who did the majority of the childcare? Who made and tracked school logistics and paperwork, appointments, extracurriculars, bought the kids clothes, etc?", "I think NTA but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re  expressing yourself in the best way. It sounds like you\u2019ve jumped to your preferred solution (no classes) without allowing her much agency or responsibility for solving the issues (chores, finances etc).\n\nI\u2019d suggest making it clear she\u2019s responsible for 50% of the chores and letting her figure out how she\u2019s going to make that happen. Similarly if you don\u2019t want to be spending all the course fees etc then have a discussion about your other financial priorities (savings, hobbies, house upgrades, whatever) and agree a budget that allows for all that stuff - if she feels like she\u2019s going to be short of what she wants then maybe she\u2019ll use her new skills to find a better paid job. But overall there\u2019s a disconnect here which needs addressing: either she needs better career advice or there\u2019s some other reason she\u2019s spending so much time and money on courses that don\u2019t benefit her professionally, and I feel like it might help you both to work out what the issue is there.", "My point is simply that it\u2019s not fair to expect one spouse to use all their time to deal with the offspring while the other spouse goes off to class - for 8 years.\nOr goes off to fantasy football or scrapbooking etc.\nBecause ultimately the kids have to look at this and wonder if anyone wants to spend time/do things with them.\nTo me, you\u2019re not TA.\nTA is the parent who doesn\u2019t want to show up.\nWhen people become parents, they need to be there.\nIf there were no kids in your relationship, then I\u2019d say you were TA.\nKids?\nWhy is the other parent absent?\nNo, don\u2019t anyone dare say \u201cmommy time\u201d.", "I can understand she has trust issues but not doing housework and refusing to have anyone help to do it resulting in everything to be done by you is very selfish\n\nYou are clearly making compromise for your family while she is not.", "I think approval is the right word - they have two young kids so one partner can\u2019t unilaterally decide that they are going to make a big commitment that will massively affect the other/their kids without the other agreeing to it.", "And I wish I can upvote you more \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "That\u2019s Reddit for you lmao what a joke this guy is NTA the wife is taking classes and they\u2019re spending money for no reason, she already graduated and got a job. I wish I could upvote you more as well.", "I don't see myself as paying for it. Maybe before we were married yes. But her asking was 100% because of the kids. \n\nMy only fiancial rule is putting a certain amount on our retirement and kids college fund. We keep an eye on our budget so any big costs is mentioned. School is ways $10k so I at least need to know. I've had to give her the okay. She asks if there is room in the budget and I've always told her its within our budget.", "She has a job, and their finances are shared. HE didn't pay for shit, he's just taking credit where it very much ISNT due.", "I\u2019m gonna get down voted to all hell but here I go. A close friend of mine has been taking classes and doing further education. For YEARS. I have discussed with her that she has some sort of need to constantly be in school. She claims that\u2019s not it while she continues to look for more classes to take even though she is at the furthest point she possibly could be. \n\nI truly believe there is some sort of obsession or disconnect with continuing to take classes for years on end.", "Dude, she'll run out of college classes eventually. Now, if she switches her major, then you can talk.", "He needs to go back to her and to her clearly that he can't handle it all. If she wants to continue school he has to have help.\n\nAnd he made the comment about hiring a nanny..... Not babysitter, or a house cleaner, or family or friends. Heck get a hello fresh with prepared meal kits 3 nights a week. There's an easy hour of no cook time and cut back in dishes that night. Have a house cleaner come in to clean if hse doesn't trust anyone with the kids. Send out laundry to be serviced. Get a Roomba! There's so many ways to get help.\n\n He hasn't tried to convey nor push for a compromise. He just wants it HIS way. He doesn't want to make the effort to make it work for BOTH of them. That's why I voted that way.", "She always talks about advancing her career but it hasn't happened. She doesn't really apply for jobs and hasn't asked for a raise. She keeps saying she needs to do more work to get a raise.\n\nI do all the cleaning after the kids go to sleep. We do a decent job cleaning as we go but theres alot left.", "I agree. I said wording bc other words can be used like \u201csupport\u201d. \u201cAllowed\u201d leaves a controlling impression to some.", "He didn\u2019t pay for shit? Did you read the part where he *proposed* when nearing her **graduation**. They weren\u2019t even married yet but he paid for her to go back to school. She couldn\u2019t afford a degree program on her own. At least give him that.", "He's taking up extra burdens in childcare and household chores so that she can attend classes. He's not \"allowing her\" to go but he's certainly supporting her in that sense", "To be fair it seems like his wife wants it only her way and doesn\u2019t care how it effects him. You can\u2019t blast him for wanting a partner who actively contributes to child rearing and home care while simultaneously saying she should get to do whatever she wants \u2018just because\u2019. If my partner said he wanted to go back to school and it meant me doing all the home stuff and childcare I wouldn\u2019t agree to it, because it a selfish mindset.", "I think this is case of her not managing career rather then anything else. She might have low confidence to ask for raise or bad negotiation skills. I am judging so  because the \"need to work more to ask for pay raise\" and \"not applying to better jobs\" both scream that.\n\nLazy incapable people ask for paybraise and frequently gets it. \n\nMaybe you could try to talk about that with her? It is not easy to overcome fear of asking for pay raise or fear of interview. But that is what she needs.", "Supporting her, yes, as any partner should do. He still claims significantly more credit than is due as far as her going to school is concerned. And given his immediate demand that she stop doing something she is clearly enjoying and is building her up as soon as he decided chores and kids are hard, he doesn't support her *that much* either.", "This is the vibe I got too. Getting more education can be used as a bartering chip to get a raise or better job, but it's not going to happen if she doesn't ask. The company now has an highly qualified employee still working at her starting pay. Why would they give that up?", "I can\u2019t\u2014like just reread the post at this point. \u201cImmediate demand\u201d AKA \u201cover the last 8 years enrolled in various classes\u2026didn\u2019t mind because she enjoyed it\u201d 8 years = immediate? If you\u2019re not counting the years without kids then \u201cSarah\u2019s class is **wrapping** up\u201d - so, still not *immediate* oh and because you said he demanded, it literally says \u201cI *asked* her not to take the class\u201d."]}
