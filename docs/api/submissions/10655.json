Aside from the obvious, this was a co-parenting agreement that you both agreed to so if he doesn't uphold them then he's the Ah. \n\nI don't think gf should be pressured to meet you, but dad should take ownership and be clear.

It\u2019s important for all adult caregivers to try to build good relationships in order to communicate about your child\u2019s needs. You don\u2019t necessarily need to like each other if you meet and don\u2019t get along but it\u2019s very important for you all to at least try. Meeting her is not about getting your approval or making her uncomfortable, it\u2019s about building strong relationships for your kid.", "NTA.  You have the right to meet people who will be interacting with your son and it doesn't matter if the gf has already met your son. The first time was a freebie since it was an emergency and doesn't negate the agreed upon process.  If you haven't had a court ordered agreement then get a lawyer to start the process.

I can completely understand why you\u2019d want this from a comfort stand point. \n\nRespectfully, morality clauses have really, really fallen by the wayside with the current family court system. They are seen as unenforceable, can be controlling in an abuse/domestic violence situation, and used to frustrate the parenting relationship. \n\n4 months is a perfectly reasonable time to expect your ex to abide by, it\u2019s in your child\u2019s best interest, however, that won\u2019t be something that holds up for withholding parenting time. Unfortunately, your ex does not actually have to abide by this. \n\nYou absolutely should have your agreement on file with the court. Writing it up and signing it isn\u2019t legally enforceable. It\u2019s much easier to do this while you agree (and less costly).", "My ex & I had the same exact rule.  I needed to meet the new gf before my kids do if it was something we thought was serious.  I think it's a great rule.  Not that you would really have any say in whether or not he would continue to date her, but at least you'd have an idea who your children are spending time with.", "NTA you had a clear boundary agreed on by both of you and it should be followed.", "nta\n\nput your foot down, thats reasonable.", "Can you elaborate on what decisions make you uncomfortable? Did you and your ex have a formal custody agreement, or did you only write it down on paper?", "NTA\n\nYou are very much within your rights as a mom to keep this boundary.\n\nHe only cares bc it makes his life more convenient if he can see his gf while he has custody of his son. \n\nIf its that important to them, they can meet you.

Does that mean you will refuse to allow your child to be there?", "INFO-So what do you expect to happen if you don't approve of his girlfriend?", "Nta.  You are maintaining the same rules you both agreed to.  That before a partner of ex spend regular time around child, other ex has to meet them. Even due to an emergency which she spent time with him does in no way negate original agreement.", "Ever heard the saying, 'you cannot put the cat back in the bag'. The rule you discussed did not cover this situation. It was a rule to be applied prior to meeting the child not subsequent, she's already met him due to your medical emergency. \n\nI get wanting to meet her if she is going to be around your son. As a mother I totally understand that feeling, however I've also been a family lawyer for nearly 20 years and the professional side while emphasizing with you needs to tell you that you did not have an agreement in place to cover this situation, a situation that occurred due to your emergency (not his). Your agreement was meant to prevent this from happening but because of your requirements (not his) it occurred. Additionally, this was always a non enforceable agreement that is only in effect as long as you both agree to it. Co-parenting is hard for many reasons but one of the biggest is you will never meet everyone your child is being exposed to by your ex. You need to trust your ex will not expose them to inappropriate ppl. \n\nIf I were advising you I would tell you to weigh up the value of forcing a meeting with a person who has already met your child and who you are unlikely to like against the damage this may cause the relationship you need with your ex to successfully co-parent for the next 16 years. Personally, I never understood rules like this, not introducing till there is a serious relationship, sure that makes sense, but meeting the partner first is really just to assuage your mind it does nothing of value for the child. I say this because let's say you meet her for all of 5 minutes and think she's the most toxic narcissist in the world.... What then? Your ex isn't going to suddenly change his mind about her. You have no agreement that you each need to approve the others partner. Is this really a productive rule?", "Info: I'm unsure what you mean by the title. How are you preventing your son from being around her?", "ESH. I'm a child of divorced parents who, thankfully, were able to remain friends despite some crappy things my dad did.  It would have been so much harder if my mom had put conditions on the time my dad and I spent together, especially if they were known to me.  Both of my parents dated and eventually re married after the divorce and I only met the more serious ones.  \n\nObviously if you feel like your ex has an environment that's a safely risk for your kid that's a different story.  But if you're just trying to gate keep his other relationships you're likely to end up putting your son in a difficult position.", "ESH\nHe should be respecting you and your son to have you all meet before introducing the girlfriend to your son.

And honestly, it\u2019s a relevant to the situation.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s very unhealthy for you to meet the woman that he cheated on you with, especially since you were still so hurt by it.

Should she just roll over and let her child possibly be abused? I\u2019m not saying the gf will 100% abuse the child, but it\u2019s still a possibility. The mom has a right to protect her child, it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s hung up on this sperm donor.

She is definitely hung up on him. And he\u2019s more than a sperm donor. He is the child\u2019s father, hence this custody issue. Stop with the misandry.", "My kids dad does suck and I don't trust him - which is why I want to vet the people he brings around our son.", "Does having a gf come before having a child? If his gf truly cares, she would understand boundaries. If the father can\u2019t respect his child\u2019s mother and make time for his child, that\u2019s his issue. OP isn\u2019t saying the gf can never be around the child, she just wants to meet her first. OP is NTA unless she gives a blanket \u201cno gf around my child\u201d regardless of whether she meets the gf or not", "What\u2019s with the epidemic of people deflecting from the situation at hand by bringing up an unrelated topic?\n\nThe child\u2019s father, the one who cheated multiple times, does not sound like a great judge of character. I personally would disregard whatever he thinks of this stranger. How is OP punishing this stranger? Is OP\u2019s desire to protect her child a punishment? That seems a little illogical. I\u2019ve never been hit by a car, but I would still be cautious with my child around strange drivers I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been molested, but I would still be cautious with my child around strangers I know nothing about. \n\nNothing is fair about this situation. Her previously agreed upon deal is not being held up. A true father would want what\u2019s best for his child and the mother, even if he isn\u2019t with her anymore. Since he is disregarding the co-parent, I demoted him to sperm donor. Can you acknowledge a mother\u2019s protective instincts toward a child, especially since OP was not protected when she was a child? Can you have some empathy and consideration?\n\nHow about you stop with the misogyny? You saying she brought up cheating twice seems quite judgmental, maybe she touched upon a sore subject for you?", "Absolutely not. But if this issue is dividing father and child OP has a part in the issue. The father has a right to see his own child regardless if the girlfriend is around or not. As long as he is not leaving the child alone with his girlfriend without OP\u2019s permission, he should still be able to spend time with his own son. I\u2019m not sure what you are not understanding about the fact it is important for a child to grow up with a relationship with both parents. And reducing the father to a \u201csperm donor\u201d sounds like you are siding with OP simply because she is the mother. I am not siding with anyone in the situation, if you are not letting your son see his father because of his girlfriend, that is an issue.", "I spent one sentence talking about your use of the word \u201cliterally\u201c and then moved onto address your points. That\u2019s not deflecting lol. \n\nOP is not a great judge of character either, since she picked the husband.  And you keep ignoring my valid point questioning her ability to be objective in the situation.\n\nEven so, what does cheating have to do with anything? It doesn\u2019t impact the ability to assess whether or not one\u2019s partner is able to care for an 18 month-old toddler.  \n\nHe\u2019s not obligated to regard the wishes of his coparent. He\u2019s obligated to give the child love and care when he has him.  A sperm donor is a man who impregnates a woman and then abandons the resulting child. That is not what is happening, so you\u2019re letting your emotions affect your judgment.\n\nThe \u201cpunishment\u201d comes from the fact that she\u2019s using the fact that she had an awful stepmother to project that onto every other possible stepmother; and as a result, she is insisting that she spend time with this woman in order to give her stamp of approval before the new girlfriend can be with the baby. \n\nI am positive the OP is the one who initiated this part agreement, since she\u2019s upset at the new GF. And nothing in her post suggests that she has a man, so the ex-husband would have very little incentive to bring it up.\n\nAnd when she had an emergency situation she was apparently OK with her son meeting the girlfriend.  So it\u2019s really hard to argue that the OP has some legitimate concern about the girlfriend being a sex offender or some such.  OP\u2019s \u201cmaternal instincts\u201c went out the window when she had a situation.  \n\nAnd I suggest looking up the word \u201cmisogyny,\u201c because you don\u2019t appear to know what it means.\n\nEventually, you will understand the psychology of bringing up irrelevant points and how it reveals that someone is still dealing with that trauma. \n\nThere is no reason to bring up the cheating because it\u2019s irrelevant. You made quite the leap from a cheater being a bad judge of character. But it\u2019s not something that OP herself expressed. Therefore, she only brought it up because of her feelings.  \n\nThis whole thing is just a big helping of spite, because she\u2019s mad that her ex moved on with a younger and hotter chick.", "Where did OP say there was a total ban preventing him from seeing his child? Why are you immediately jumping to the fact that the OP is a selfish, cruel mother? Pretty funny of you to make a comment about me saying he\u2019s a speak donor while you\u2019re degrading the mother like that\nHe does not have the right to see his child if the gf is around because he previously agreed to not let significant others meet the child until the parent has met them. He can spend a day away from his gf to spend time with his own child, the one he helped make and will be forever tied to. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what you aren\u2019t understanding about OP\u2019s concerns. Do you understand her concern that the gf is a complete stranger to her? Do you understand that OP was abused by a step parent as a child? Do you understand so many children today are abused by blood parents and step parents? Should OP just give up and let any random person be around her child unsupervised?\n\nEdited to add: being around a father is not healthy if the relationship and care is not healthy. Do you not understand that this situation is not black and white? Do you not understand that not every child will be better off having a father and mother around? Should a child whose father is abusive be around that man because \u201cit\u2019s important for a child to have both parents\u201d? Sounds like you might be a dead beat dad who took offense to this and is siding against OP because you\u2019re a man\n\nEdit 2: i looked at your posts and you\u2019re a child of divorce and were not raised in an ideal situation, which is outside of your control. I\u2019d say your attitude toward OP comes from your situation, you probably should project less and get some therapy. You clearly have issues with your mom and are assuming OP is toxic because of your past experiences. You are not a man siding with a man, you are a woman going against a mom because of your pent up issues", "You say bringing up the cheating was irrelevant, but your last comment about the new girlfriend being younger and hotter was also not necessary. You can make your point without insulting OP for her age and appearance.", "Where did I degrade the mother? Simply by disagreeing with your opinion? Or stating that you degraded the father? I understand OP\u2019s concerns I wouldn\u2019t want my child around a stranger without parental supervision. All I\u2019m saying is the child needs a relationship with both parents and if that\u2019s being disrupted (notice how I said \u201cif\u201d) than OP plays a part in that too. OP should absolutely not take total blame for the situation. But if the father is still able to see his child frequently, than no, I do not see a problem with the child not being allowed around the gf."]}
