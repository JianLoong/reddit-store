The rule you discussed did not cover this situation. It was a rule to be applied prior to meeting the child not subsequent, she's already met him due to your medical emergency. \n\nI get wanting to meet her if she is going to be around your son. As a mother I totally understand that feeling, however I've also been a family lawyer for nearly 20 years and the professional side while emphasizing with you needs to tell you that you did not have an agreement in place to cover this situation, a situation that occurred due to your emergency (not his). Your agreement was meant to prevent this from happening but because of your requirements (not his) it occurred. Additionally, this was always a non enforceable agreement that is only in effect as long as you both agree to it. Co-parenting is hard for many reasons but one of the biggest is you will never meet everyone your child is being exposed to by your ex. You need to trust your ex will not expose them to inappropriate ppl. \n\nIf I were advising you I would tell you to weigh up the value of forcing a meeting with a person who has already met your child and who you are unlikely to like against the damage this may cause the relationship you need with your ex to successfully co-parent for the next 16 years. Personally, I never understood rules like this, not introducing till there is a serious relationship, sure that makes sense, but meeting the partner first is really just to assuage your mind it does nothing of value for the child. I say this because let's say you meet her for all of 5 minutes and think she's the most toxic narcissist in the world.... What then? Your ex isn't going to suddenly change his mind about her. You have no agreement that you each need to approve the others partner. Is this really a productive rule?", "Info: I'm unsure what you mean by the title.

I personally would disregard whatever he thinks of this stranger. How is OP punishing this stranger? Is OP\u2019s desire to protect her child a punishment? That seems a little illogical. I\u2019ve never been hit by a car, but I would still be cautious with my child around strange drivers I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been molested, but I would still be cautious with my child around strangers I know nothing about. \n\nNothing is fair about this situation. Her previously agreed upon deal is not being held up. A true father would want what\u2019s best for his child and the mother, even if he isn\u2019t with her anymore.

Can you acknowledge a mother\u2019s protective instincts toward a child, especially since OP was not protected when she was a child? Can you have some empathy and consideration?\n\nHow about you stop with the misogyny? You saying she brought up cheating twice seems quite judgmental, maybe she touched upon a sore subject for you?", "Absolutely not. But if this issue is dividing father and child OP has a part in the issue. The father has a right to see his own child regardless if the girlfriend is around or not. As long as he is not leaving the child alone with his girlfriend without OP\u2019s permission, he should still be able to spend time with his own son. I\u2019m not sure what you are not understanding about the fact it is important for a child to grow up with a relationship with both parents. And reducing the father to a \u201csperm donor\u201d sounds like you are siding with OP simply because she is the mother.

Why are you immediately jumping to the fact that the OP is a selfish, cruel mother? Pretty funny of you to make a comment about me saying he\u2019s a speak donor while you\u2019re degrading the mother like that\nHe does not have the right to see his child if the gf is around because he previously agreed to not let significant others meet the child until the parent has met them. He can spend a day away from his gf to spend time with his own child, the one he helped make and will be forever tied to. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what you aren\u2019t understanding about OP\u2019s concerns. Do you understand her concern that the gf is a complete stranger to her? Do you understand that OP was abused by a step parent as a child? Do you understand so many children today are abused by blood parents and step parents? Should OP just give up and let any random person be around her child unsupervised?\n\nEdited to add: being around a father is not healthy if the relationship and care is not healthy. Do you not understand that this situation is not black and white? Do you not understand that not every child will be better off having a father and mother around? Should a child whose father is abusive be around that man because \u201cit\u2019s important for a child to have both parents\u201d? Sounds like you might be a dead beat dad who took offense to this and is siding against OP because you\u2019re a man\n\nEdit 2: i looked at your posts and you\u2019re a child of divorce and were not raised in an ideal situation, which is outside of your control. I\u2019d say your attitude toward OP comes from your situation, you probably should project less and get some therapy. You clearly have issues with your mom and are assuming OP is toxic because of your past experiences. You are not a man siding with a man, you are a woman going against a mom because of your pent up issues", "You say bringing up the cheating was irrelevant, but your last comment about the new girlfriend being younger and hotter was also not necessary. You can make your point without insulting OP for her age and appearance.", "Where did I degrade the mother? Simply by disagreeing with your opinion? Or stating that you degraded the father? I understand OP\u2019s concerns I wouldn\u2019t want my child around a stranger without parental supervision. All I\u2019m saying is the child needs a relationship with both parents and if that\u2019s being disrupted (notice how I said \u201cif\u201d) than OP plays a part in that too. OP should absolutely not take total blame for the situation. But if the father is still able to see his child frequently, than no, I do not see a problem with the child not being allowed around the gf.", "YTA. Sorry but when its his time its his time. AS long as he doesnt endager the child he can take the child where he wants and introduce the child to whomever he wants, just as you can. Take it to court. Its unlikely they will say you cannot regulate unless you have proof of actual problems.

You have every right to assess who has access to your child AND model for your child what it looks like to maintain boundaries.", "Generally good advice, but before you do ANYTHING in court, talk with a local lawyer or Legal Aid. In my state, for instance, an unmarried mother has all the parental rights automatically and the unmarried father has no rights without filing for custody. So an unmarried mother filing for custody in this state could only lose and cannot gain. This varies wildly by state, so it\u2019s really, really important to know how your state does it before going forward.", "All of this x1000", "So you wouldn't care to meet someone thats going to be around your child?", "I don\u2019t get this tho.

She can\u2019t force them to break up - what\u2019s the actual plan at that point?", "I just read that comment and my take away is that OPs dad went to visit the GF.  It didn't explicitly say that her son went to visit.  Thinking that GF gave a bug to dad who gave it to son who then got the baby sick.  It depends on the circumstances but passing a cold around in and off itself doesn't trip a red flag to me.", "The sperm donor language is pretty dehumanising", "There\u2019s no plan. He just won\u2019t waste his money by paying for a wedding he doesn\u2019t approve of", "Gonna have to disagree with you. I have friends who are not in a relationship with their child\u2019s other parent, but have a new partner they don\u2019t live with. When the partner is sick, they stay away. My own sister is also in this situation, her and her ex always give each other the heads up when they catch something, because they don\u2019t want my niece to get sick. Sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable, but if you knowingly come around someone who\u2019s sick knowing you have a child to take care of, that\u2019s super irresponsible. His girlfriend could have waited until she\u2019s better. \n\nAlso did you read the part she has a meltdown when they have to communicate. All of her behavior is super immature for someone who\u2019s in a relationship with someone with kids. The new girlfriend has an issue with them communicating. She needs to get over it. But the ex is allowing these behaviors to continue. He\u2019s the issue here.", "He deserves to have a life too. It shouldn't be a decision between his kid and friends/ romantic relationships.  Should she get to approve every friend he has over with OP until his kid is 18?", "The issue is that except in extreme circumstances, you don\u2019t actually have the power to do this. The father can introduce the kids to anyone he likes and doesn\u2019t need your approval.", "Agree with your points but think OP shares some of the issue. She's clearly still hurt by her ex's actions so every little thing is another indictment.  I think you have 3 adults, especially the 2 parents, who are acting in ways that are detrimental to the kid. Hence why I said ESH.  In these situations they need to put aside the feelings and communicate about how they can fairly co-parent because while their romantic connection is dead they'll always have a relationship through their son. Whether that's good or bad is up to them.", "That\u2019s not what OP wants, if he\u2019s going to have a revolving door of women, then yea the kid shouldn\u2019t have to be around that. But if he\u2019s planning on spending his life with someone of course she should meet this woman and see what she\u2019s like.", "OP is responsible for her actions, and how she acts and reacts. But she\u2019s not responsible for her ex and his choices. It truly looks like he\u2019s picking his relationship over his son if he doesn\u2019t respect his co-parents boundaries. It\u2019s not unreasonable for her to want to at least meet the woman. She\u2019s not saying they can\u2019t be together, I think she knows she has no say in that. \n\nIf the shoe was on the other foot, he\u2019d probably have an issue with a new boyfriend coming around their son. All I\u2019m saying is for better or worse, they have to work together. And any new partners also need to understand that. The new girlfriend clearly wants to disrupt their co-parenting relationship, and this is one of the ways parental alienation starts. \n\nDad needs to set boundaries with his girlfriend.  She is not their child\u2019s mom, and it would be the very best for the baby for them all to be civil. They\u2019re also making it personal here, which is what other people are also forgetting. What valid reason does she have to not meet her boyfriends son\u2019s mom?", "But OP doesn't get to decide who gets introduced to her kid.  That's for her ex to do.  OP can certainly ask that he be cognizant of his son's feelings but she really doesn't get a say if dad is seeing multiple women or not.\n\nNow if son comes home and says dad is doing something illegal or harmful, she can take that to court.  But if she just doesn't agree that he's got girlfriends then she really doesn't have a say.", ">OP is responsible for her actions, and how she acts and reacts. But she\u2019s not responsible for her ex and his choices\n\nAgreed, hence the ESH from me. They both own it. \n\nI agree with most of your points about working together. \n\n>What valid reason does she have to not meet her boyfriends son\u2019s mom?\n\nSpeaking from a bit of experience here having been married before, but no kids. If my ex demanded to meet a new GF, I'd find that incredibly uncomfortable.  The GF is looking to have a relationship with OPs ex, not OP.  So I could see why the GF doesn't want to meet the ex at it child lead to big drama.", "It was something both op and ex agreed on.

It\u2019s going to be extremely awkward and uncomfortable for him if all the adults in his life are acting like the other doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nI think they all need to put aside their pride and be civil. They don\u2019t have to be best friends, but they can be polite.", "Really? Maybe I'm the odd ball here but I wouldn't go out of my way to meet a new GFs ex.

You said \u201cmight be.\u201d You have no idea. \n\nThe first rule of this sub is to be civil. You aren\u2019t being civil if you result to belittling someone for not being as hot or young as someone else. All you\u2019re doing is reducing women to objects. She\u2019s allowed to be concerned for her child without it having to do with her feelings towards her ex. \n\nLike who hurt you dude? Stop projecting your issues with women on OP.", "YTA\n\nNot for how you feel, but for not having a legally enforceable custody agreement. As long as he is on the birth certificate, Baby Daddy can essentially do whatever he wants with your child when he is in his care, and that includes having your son and his GF spend time together.\n\nI really do sympathize with wanting to have some idea of who the people your son spends his time with are, but unfortunately you don't have the right to enforce that. A legal custody agreement should have been discussed the same day the breakup happened, and it's not too late to get one now.", "NTA! You have the right to know who your child is around.", "NTA but if you want us to be enforceable, it needs to be done through the court. I think it\u2019s totally fair to want to meet someone who is spending time around your very young child", "NTA if you have a custody agreement you can take this to court because no judge is going to side with your ex, you have a right as the child\u2019s mother to know who your child spends time with, they are being very immature about this and that makes me question if she\u2019s really a good person", "umm... wtf? why doesn't she want to meet you? that's either her being petty, or a crazier thing, they could be planning to take your baby. idk. that's just weird. but you're NTA.", "NTA especially given your son's age. I would understand relaxing that rule when kids are old enough to be mostly self sufficient but not as a toddler.", "YTA. You have no say and are not required to meet her just as he wouldn't be for you. A judge will tell you that too. Unless you can prove the other parent is neglectful or putting the child in danger the judge will tell you to butt out. You both have every right to move on or have other relationships without the other's knowledge or permission.", "NTA. Its a job as your parent to make sure the people your son is around are safe for him physically, mentally, and emotionally. You definitely don't need to like her, but you should have a chance to meet her because he's not the only one who needs to \"vet\" her if you will. I'm glad you're standing up for yourself and your son. That she is so opposed to meeting you is a red flag to me. What is she hiding? Or is she just so immature she can't handle being around her partner's ex, in which case I'd worry about how she talks about you around your child.", "The girlfriend should want to meet the OP if this a serious relationship for her. The OP is potential future co-parent.", "NTA\n\nThe GF probably doesn't want to meet the OP out of guilt as she was the other woman causing the break up..", "Kindly, no court will actually put that in the order and it\u2019s not enforceable. \n\nIt\u2019s the polite thing to do. But not required. The court cannot force you to be kind.", "Yes yes yes. Absolutely. All of this is so accurate.", "And what legal reason (that the courts or police can enforce) is that?", "she wants to see if the girlfriend is safe for her literal baby to be around. how does this make her an asshole?", "I didn\u2019t want to meet the bio mom of my step kiddo because the mom threatened to physically assault me if I didn\u2019t come and that she would break us up because she already didn\u2019t like me. She said she had \u201ca lot of stories\u201d for me when she met me about my current partner. \n\nJust sharing this because things you read on Reddit are part of the story. It\u2019s not always so cut and dry. I\u2019d love bio mom to be an awesome girl I could go for wine with. But she\u2019s not. And I refused to protect myself.", "It\u2019s not kindness. It\u2019s safety. And you do know that different courts do things differently? That depending on the jurisdiction and circumstances the court can do damn near anything that falls within their purview.\n\nI will say OP should go see a lawyer, but taking legal advice from someone who is so much not a lawyer that you didn\u2019t even think to give a disclosure? Yeah no \ud83d\ude02", "I mean, at this point they need to create a custody agreement (through the legal system if they live in the usa). From what I understand, these agreements can have stipulations about how to care for, when to care for, and who can care for a child.\n\nI believe punishments may be legally provided if there is proof of breaking an established custody agreement. \n\nFrom what I've heard, punishments can include reduced custody, additional child support, and/or protective/restraining orders.\n\nBut I am in no ways a professional. That's just my understanding.", "Okay. Andddd what next? Do you truly think that you have any control over who your ex dates and your child is around? \n\nAs someone experienced in this area, unless she is has a criminal record or is a child abuser, you have zero say. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to be painted as the bitter baby mama. But. How are you acting right now? You are projecting your childhood trauma into your child now, and even you say that you are \u201centitled\u201d. \n\nWhat if the script flips? You date someone and your ex now wants payback and decides to make your life hell because he doesn\u2019t like the new guy? Wouldn\u2019t be fair, right? But if you don\u2019t like her for any reason you can document it for court and recommend to your lawyer that your son and her don\u2019t interact? How is that even feasible if your ex lives with her? \n\nHonestly. Pick your battles and read lilly of the valleys comment. \n\nIt will save you a world of pain later. You have two choices here. Start off co parenting on the wrong foot and it will forever be a battle, or have some grace.", "That's some weird behavior. You need a custody agreement to protect yourself.", "Because he's the father and guess what, fathers have the exact same rights as mothers do. Which includes the right to decide who he brings around his child. Your use of the phrase \"sperm donor\" betrays your animosity towards men and fathers and it's not a good look.\n\nI agree with OP and what she's worried about, but she has no right to enforce anything, morally or legally.", "No, but if she feels like she\u2019s doing something wrong that might endanger her child, she could request that she\u2019s not left alone with her child with no supervision. It also could just be a reassurance thing, like just getting a feel of the person who will spend time with her child. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable", "I\u2019m sorry disclosure for what? Where did I say I was a lawyer? \n\nI have work and personal experience with family court and have seen multiple cases first hand where this was not something they could put in the agreement for the exact reason that it\u2019s not enforceable."]}
