Neither of which, is my fault.\n\nI have been paying for really expensive allergy-safe kibble his entire life, which the Vet has said is useless if he is still eating human food. Never in his life has he received human food from me, but My family feeds him human food every single day, basically a bite of whatever they eat , they give to my dog (of course no super toxic stuff thankfully) bc they think he deserves it. This is the reason for weight gain. \n\nOn top of the human food my family insists on leaving a full bowl of his kibble out 24/7 and their reasoning is \u201che might get hungry throughout the day\u201d. If i pick it up and put it away, they will bring it back out. The vet hammered in that if he stays at this weight, hip/joint issues and arthritis is 100% in his future. \n\nI\u2019ve been running back and forth to the vet his entire life for his skin allergies and weight issues.

This means more bills! \n\nMy family agreed that they would stop over feeding and giving him human food but i notice they still feed him things and just try to hide it better.\n\nI finally told my family that if they are going to continue to cause these health issues i\u2019m not going to pay for anything.
