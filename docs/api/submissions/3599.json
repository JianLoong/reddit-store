I can understand how it may have hurt your step dad, but I think it\u2019s important for the child to lead in these situations. Your parents should not, on **ANY LEVEL** be angry at you or punishing you. What you wanted it to say was something like Parents, Mom Anne & Step-dad John. The school made the mistake and brought all this down on you.\n\nI (45F) have 2 adult bonus kids, 31NB & 28F (I prefer bonus to step because it sounds like a wonderful surprise\u2026like ooh! I I ordered 2 cookies & got a bonus cookie!) and I\u2019ve been in their lives since they were 7 & 4. **I am their Bonus Mom and that\u2019s perfect and wonderful!** I\u2019m not saying it was all sunshine and roses\u2026There were definitely growing pains. I was **super** enthusiastic about being a Bonus Mom and was **DETERMINED** to be the **best** bonus mom in the **world**, I would be the stuff of legends and immortalized in history as the model for other bonus parents! (\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02) So, I did A LOT of & overstepping into their mom\u2019s territory and had a *bit* of a wrecking ball approach. I had to listen and learn to reach the place we are all in today. \n\nMy husband got custody when they were 10 & 8 and the youngest, who is multiply disabled and full care, will always live with us. So, I was and am a full time, take care of them day in and day out, clean up their vomit when they are sick, help the oldest when they did homework, sit for hours in the cold and rain watching them play sports (I really hate sports, just saying), stay in the hospital after multiple surgeries, up all night worrying about the future, and everything in between Bonus; however, **They HAVE a Mom!** We didn\u2019t always get along (remember the wrecking ball, AKA *me* ), there were mistakes on both sides, but we are good now and all four of us (Bonus Dad too) co-parent very well... **The role of a bonus parent is not the same role of a parent but that is ok!** It\u2019s unique and can be so many different things and I think that\u2019s amazing! There\u2019s a stigma in our society that Bonus Parents are  *less than* and it\u2019s so wrong\u2026the role is just different. My kids call me Ima (EE-mah) which is Hebrew for Mom & was picked out by my oldest. \n\n**Do you want to have a closer relationship with your step-dad?** Is their a level of relationship that you\u2019d be comfortable with as long as he didn\u2019t try to overstep into your late father\u2019s territory? Maybe uncle? Maybe there\u2019s a special name you can come up with to call him? I will say, as a bonus parent, the hurt can be very real when you love that kid **so freaking much** and it feels like you\u2019re an after-thought. I think your step-dad\u2019s anger is coming from a place of hurt. Not that it\u2019s ok that he\u2019s putting his issues on you. That is **NEVER** ok\u2026just that I can understand where he is coming from. If you can\u2019t see him as anything other than your mom\u2019s husband, that will have to be ok.

Really, all you want is a validation of the unique relationship that exists and to not feel like the \"alternate\".\n\n--You're a mother or a father, but you are **painfully, heart wrenchingly, soul crushingly** most definitely NOT one. \n\nAnd *every* time you are reminded of that, it takes you by surprise and feels like a punch in the gut and you *literally* have trouble breathing; because for *some* reason you just weren't expecting it. \n\nEven though it has happened before, even though it has happened over and over, and *over* you are somehow utterly unprepared to be **clobbered** with the truth that even though they are your kid, you will always be their \"step\" parent\u2026and it never, ever stops hurting.", "YTA. \n\nIf you\u2019d left it, your friends and family would know there was a mistake and think nothing of it.

But his kids also do about my mom. They would leap on anyone who said my mom and stepdad were their parents. I have never done that but the distinction or dad and stepdad is important to me. My dad died but he is still very much my dad.", "That's not the point.  She doesn't consider him dad so why should it not be corrected to what she sees him as? If the step parent can't handle not being considered \"dad\" or \"mom\" then that's on them and not the kid.", "That's super immature.", "This take is absurdly immature.", "Look at you trying to express how what happened hurt the STEP FATHER'S feelings while at the same time minimising this 16 yr old feelings....", "And that's not your call. You're not him. Unless you are and hiding in the comments?", "He is the adult.  She is the child.   He needs to recognize that.  It is not HER job to deal with his feelings.   It is obvious why she changed it.", "So since he loves it, why not take him down a peg and make it a point.  I think he get its now", "Hey I feel for you for sure.  I am very sorry for your loss, and this guy as good as his may be, cannot fill in for that.  I\u2019ll say your request for the correction in the paper is understandable.  If I knew you, and you asked should I do this thing, I\u2019d say no.  Unless you really don\u2019t like the guy, it will be seen as very hurtful and I don\u2019t think you want that.", "I hear ya, but she said he's a good guy.  He's been a caregiver and acted the role for years.  Going out of your way to correct that is going to sting and most rational people would take it poorly.  I am not saying she has to call him dad and reciprocate his desire to be close, but you should still be sensitive to his feelings about the matter. I think the OP messed up here, that's all.", "What on earth are you on about? He's not telling OP (idk their gender) to deal with his feelings. He's just informing them or simply experiencing emotions and OP has the ability to understand how people behave when they're sad.\n\n(Step) Parents talking about their feelings with their (step) kids is nothing strange or unusual. If I did something to hurt my mum she lets me know, even if what I did was 100% my right and morally okay, even as a child. \n\nOP is not a little kid anymore. They're old enough to start building more equal relationships with their (step) parents now. That means proper discussion of ideas and emotions rather than the stricter bond they have when the kids are younger.", "I'm not trying to but I am taking my feelings into account.", "I hear you but being a good guy doesn't entitle you to something people don't see you as. He knew the whole time she didn't see him that way so not sure why they are shocked.", "Apparently adults don't have feelings", "I don't disagree with you, he is not entitled to it. I don't think they are shocked by this, they are hurt by it."]}
