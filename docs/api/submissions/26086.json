It's an incredibly heavy thing to bring up the massacres of thousands *to your Indonesian-descended daughter-in-law* over some jewelry. Huge swing. It makes me feel like this is about his grandchildren having Indonesian culture more than anything. While he could just be using this as an excuse to assert generational control, he also could have trauma from those genuinely harrowing times that he doesn't know how to process or communicate around properly; he could deep down have issues or resentment or something about his son marrying into an Indonesian family because of that time and he's finally found a way he thinks he can act on it; who knows. All of the above are possible. It's also of course possible that it's none of them and he's just an old man who got fixated on something and is now dug in about it. \n\nI think it's worth sticking to your guns on this one. Even more than starting a general pattern of him getting his way in how your kids are raised, as others have brought up, I worry about beginning a specific pattern of his rejecting, denigrating, or otherwise negating your side of the family's culture in ways that will affect your children, who should know and take pride in both sides.\n\nNTA, and good luck.", "NTA.

I'm guessing he wasn't super comfortable expressing his feelings, and he probably went into that conversation expecting total compliance. I think the first part was relatively productive because he explained why he's afraid of the perception of showing off. I agree that the ultimatum was a hurtful choice. My parents used to play that card and a lot of times it was a way to express/quantify exactly how passionately they felt about something. Nevertheless, vindictive word choice is not okay and you can decide whether you want a relationship with your in-laws or not. If you choose the relationship, I'd prioritize working through the main galang conflict first and tackle the ultimatum stuff separately. If your husband knows of a cultural equivalent that your FIL already understands, try to reference that example to bridge the gap. If not, you could try sharing pictures of your grandparents and/or describe special memories of them to convey how the bracelet tradition feeds that connection and also includes your daughter.

I got so angry when he began explaining Indonesian history to me as if I was using my \u201cfamily tradition\u201d as an excuse to have my daughter wear pretty jewelry. He actually started bringing up systematic raping, etc, and said maybe it was tradition back then, but it was a hard lesson that the Chinese had to learn not to show off. I didn\u2019t put this in due to character limit, but he told me he didn\u2019t \u201cbuy\u201d my family tradition as a good reason. I really fought back about that and asked him if he was calling me a liar, that my mother was the one who had to flee her home country. At this point, I wish the galang were an ugly piece of rope or something. \n\nA side note is that I am very close to my parents and usually tell them everything that is going on in my life. I can\u2019t even imagine telling them any of what he said because they will go absolutely ballistic.", "Thank you for highlighting an issue that so many other comments have missed: This guy is a joyless prick, living in an imaginary grey world of suck.  He flatulates his sour attitude upon all those around him.  What a crime against the notion of childhood.", "This made me laugh. Thank you!!!", "It\u2019s just strange for me to consider racism since we are both Chinese (he is from Taiwan). He had never given me any reason to think he has negative feelings about Indonesia. My MIL is Chinese Malaysian, but since I was born in the US, maybe my understanding of racism within Asians is not deep enough.", "No\u2026it isn\u2019t unsafe.  I did, my sister did - we both went to public schools. We lived in Chicago and Milwaukee for years each (not exactly crime-free areas) and we were fine. Most people don\u2019t assume that kids are wearing real jewelry anyways.  It\u2019s no more unsafe than carrying a tablet or phone which plenty of kids have on them these days and are a safer bet to sell/pawn/use than a bracelet that may or may not be real gold to the passing eye.", "I definitely understand this concern. I grew up in LA public schools wearing them but I probably wouldn\u2019t have my daughter wear them if we lived there now. I live in the southeast US currently, which I think lowers the percent of people who recognize what she is wearing. I know there is a real risk of her being targeted for the galang, but it is a low risk. Also, I am always with her when she is not in school (sadly, her school has extremely high security because of school shootings, including multiple armed security guards wherever the children are). \n\nBig picture for the safety concern: I think that the likelihood of someone hurting her on a whim is low. If someone premeditates targeting her for her galang, it is the same risk as someone targeting our home because of the car we drive. I don\u2019t know if that is sound logic or not, but when you consider kids and safety, it\u2019s easy to want to hide them in a bunker for the rest of time.", "She\u2019s Indonesian Chinese. Even if she were \u2018biologically\u2019 100% pure Chinese, the fact she grew up in Indonesia automatically makes her lesser than superior Taiwanese culture. It\u2019s not uncommon for East Asia parents to make ridiculous ultimatums like this, so the best way to deal with it is to just call his bluff and ignore him until he comes crawling back after getting an ass walloping from MIL.", "The Chinese diaspora is complex, lots of history and trauma. Racism is the closest word to what's happening here, rather than going through several generations of prejudice.", "Absolutely, I was honestly surprised at how unfazed you seemed in the post by the way he framed it! I don't blame you one bit for being upset. He is talking about systematic rape in the context of what his grandchild should wear, my god. Is there maybe some classic Chinese chauvinism re: other Asians going on here too? It feels like there might be, even though you're all Chinese...for some people there's \"Chinese\" and *Chinese*. (And side note - no, don't let him bully you into even fancifully wishing for galang to be anything other than the beautiful thing it is! This is also a thing in many other cultures - Italians give jewelry to toddlers, for instance. Just generally in the US, it's not universal but it's not strange either. You know the fact that they're pretty bracelets is irrelevant to what's happening here, don't let him misdirect you.)\n\nI'm glad your husband and MIL support you. (I totally get why you don't want to tell your parents, but if you get to a point where you need their support, I hope you'll consider it.) If your FIL tries to follow through on his threat, I hope MIL won't feel obligated to stand with him and can either see her grandchildren separately or give him several pieces of her mind about not being able to. One way or another I doubt he can keep it up forever, but your children will always be part Indonesian. I think you're completely right to set the precedent of protecting and honoring that part of them - not to mention yourself - with your FIL right now. Don't back down. And if you haven't had a direct conversation about what's happening here culturally with your husband, definitely make sure you're on the same page.\n\nAll my best to you with this one, sincerely. Hopefully staying strong now will prevent it getting worse when the kids are older.", "Singapore here - we are Malaysia adjacent, therefore have a decent grasp on the culture.\n\nChinese Malaysians understand multi-racialism very well, and usually grasp the idea of different cultures have different traditions, even within the same ethnic group. Your parents do the galang? Sure, go ahead. In fact, in Singapore and Malaysia, it's very common for girls to be gifted simple gold bracelets or anklets for nearly all the ethnic groups. In addition, the violence against Chinese in the late 90s in Indonesia was considered horrifying, but ethnic violence is something that springs up occasionally in the region's history. It is nowhere as horrifying as some other regions, and thankfully not frequent, so it doesn't loom as large in the collective memory (that's what I experienced anyway, perhaps others can weigh in). Other Chinese in the region are familiar with an Indonesia that has since moved past it, so it's now just something that happened. People visit Indonesia (especially Bali whooohooo) all the time. \n\nTaiwanese Chinese are far more mono-ethnic, and they don't have the same day to day contact with Indonesia, which would help develop a more balanced viewpoint. Your FIL probably heard of the violence in the 90s and has never had to review his world view since. \n\nThat said, your FIL is probably being a patriarchal jackass. As a Southeast Asian with a deep respect for Asian values currently still in Southeast Asia, your culturally appropriate response should be \"oh is that so, dad?\" followed by telling your husband that his dad is his problem.", "Well, Taiwan has always been mono ethnic, and they do consider the region of SEA poor, and are biased against them.\n\nI agree with the other commenter that his world view didn't change since then, and is now projecting against you. \n\nGrandparents gifting gold anklet and bracelet to kids, is an extremely common act among ethnic Chinese, be it from Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and even Taiwan themself.", "Well it is true that people won't think children are wearing real gold. Having been mugged & lost gold I am cautious now."]}
