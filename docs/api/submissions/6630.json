Her partner was locked up a few months back and she\u2019s about to be evicted because she hasn\u2019t paid rent in 12 months.\n\nOne day, out of the blue, she knocked on my door and started chatting. She told me everything and asked if it would be possible for me to let her move in and she\u2019d pay rent.\n\nI refused saying that I don\u2019t have the room for her and the kids. She told me I could get rid off my birds and they could take the room upstairs.\n\nI said that absolutely not and unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to help her. She freaked out, told me I was a selfish asshole, that I cannot are doing more about animals than humans and a lot of other nasty things. I kicked her out.\n\nI rarely go on Facebook, I have my old one from uni but I rarely go. Not even 24 hours after I kicked Chantelle out, My other friend messaged me to log in to see what\u2019s happenings and Chantelle was slagging me off everywhere. Postings nasty things And her friends joined her and it was just so very nasty.\n\nI do feel bad though and I wonder if they\u2019re right, perhaps I am the asshole here.
