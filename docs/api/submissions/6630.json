They\u2019re happy birds and have a good life. I live alone in inherited house and half of the top floor is converted into a big pigeon room where they have all their stuff. They\u2019re trained to potty in specific places but can roam around the house exception kitchen. They have their sleep places in the big room and are locked their at night for their safety.\n\nMy friend (we\u2019re not really friends anymore, we were a long time ago, now we just kind of know each other, our lives move down in totally opposite directions) f32, Chantelle, has currently 2 kids and is 5 months pregnant with her third. Her partner was locked up a few months back and she\u2019s about to be evicted because she hasn\u2019t paid rent in 12 months.\n\nOne day, out of the blue, she knocked on my door and started chatting. She told me everything and asked if it would be possible for me to let her move in and she\u2019d pay rent.\n\nI refused saying that I don\u2019t have the room for her and the kids. She told me I could get rid off my birds and they could take the room upstairs.\n\nI said that absolutely not and unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to help her. She freaked out, told me I was a selfish asshole, that I cannot are doing more about animals than humans and a lot of other nasty things. I kicked her out.\n\nI rarely go on Facebook, I have my old one from uni but I rarely go. Not even 24 hours after I kicked Chantelle out, My other friend messaged me to log in to see what\u2019s happenings and Chantelle was slagging me off everywhere. Postings nasty things And her friends joined her and it was just so very nasty.\n\nI do feel bad though and I wonder if they\u2019re right, perhaps I am the asshole here.

Imagine the nightmare if she had moved in!? You never would have gotten rid of her.", "I\u2019m going to completely omit the birds from my judgment. \n\nAn acquaintance shows up on your doorstep. She asks you to move three, almost four, people (including kids and almost a newborn) into your home for nothing. She claims she\u2019ll pay rent but hasn\u2019t to her current landlord in a YEAR. You have absolutely no reason to believe she\u2019s good for rent. (Does she work? Will she be able to work once the baby comes? Does she get/will she get child support?) \n\nYou do NOT want that drama in your home, birds or not!\n\nNTA", "NTA Let her friends harassing you take her in.  No way, 1 person maybe but an adult, two kids and another on the way hell no.  If she was evicted she wasn\u2019t paying rent, you\u2019ll end up with a squatter.", "NTA- you don't have to take her in. Even if the birds were not in the picture and you had lots of space available you would not have to do it for her.", "NTA. Chantelle cannot manage to take care of her responsibilities like an adult but somehow seems to feel entitled to your home. Maybe, one of her enablers should offer their home.", "NTA:  they cant be releaced so why should you,  besides its her fault for getting with a criminal and not yours", "NTA\n\nIf she hasn't paid rent in 12 months how in the heck is she going to pay you rent?  Then for her to come out the blue and ask to move in with two kids and one on the way is over the top.  You have no obligations to this woman.  Who cares what her or her friends are saying on FB.  If they are so concern she can move in with one of them.  She or her friends don't mean anything to you.", "NTA\n\nYou are under no obligation to give up your animals or part of your house for someone that you used to know.", "NTA\n\nShe is getting evicted due to not paying rent, yet expects you to believe she will pay you?? Hahahaha yeah.....\n\nYou did the right thing", "NTA 12 is greater than 5. She got pregnant 7 months behind in rent. Her choice, not your job to fix.\n\nDelete your FB and never look back.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your \u2018friend\u2019s\u2019 proposal was not reasonable, and you had every right to say no.", "NTA at all. She's not you responsibility, your birds are though. She needs to take responsibility for her own kids.", "NTA\n\nYou can't just show up at someone's house and demand they throw out their pets.", "Come on. Obviously not, and you wouldn't be even if you didn't have the pets. It's your house. You get to decide who lives there. She hasn't paid rent in 12 months. Why would you believe she'd pay you? If anything, she'd likely become a squatter and end up kicking you out.\n\nVery obviously, NTA.", "NTA times a million. I wonder what the story is she's telling everyone. I mean if it's literally she walked up to your house out of the blue and screamed at you for not letting her move in with her kids, I can't imagine anybody feeling bad for her", "NTA.  Wonder why her friends that are helping her trash you online aren't letting her stay with them?\n\nYou don't owe anyone anything, and her behavior proved you especially don't owe here anything at all.", "Nope", "NTA\n\nPerhaps you might reply on the social media saying you are delighted that she has so many friends who support her point of view and would be willing to house her family rent free, and to rehome their own pets to do so, and that you wish her a happy time staying with them.", "Even if you didn't have birds, you have zero obligation to take on anyone, especially not a total dodge who has a history of not paying rent and showed up out of the blue.

Absolutely NTA, cut her out of your life cuz she sucks \u2026 lol", "NTA.  In this case it doesn't matter whether it is your living animals or a stinky wheel of cheese you wouldn't get rid of to let her move in.   You simply are not running a shelter for pregnant acquaintances.    It's a little presumptuous, but she can ask--but she can't demand. \n\nAnd you can respond, as you did, that you cannot accommodate her, period.   Assuming you aren't father to one of the kids, you have no obligation to her.  \n\nNor should you be expected to believe her promise of rent if she hasn't paid for her current place in a year.", "NTA - appears out of the blue with kids and wants you to turn your house upside down for her>?!?!?", "I love how you're the selfish one as she shows up unannounced on your doorstep to demand that you get rid of your pets to accommodate her. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Pets = family. I don\u2019t know why society values an animals life less than a humans life but i I really wish we made animal equality the new norm. Just because a dog (or pigeon in your case) doesn\u2019t speak human languages and doesn\u2019t have thumbs doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re worth less.", "First of all, the only selfish person here is her. Who shows up at someone\u2019s home, kids in tow demanding that they uproot their lives to house them? WOW She hasn\u2019t paid rent in a year but can suddenly pay you rent? Yeah right. Those Facebook friends of hers should offer her and her kids a place to live since they know so damn much & are apparently saints. NTA", "NTA, she\u2019s nuts! I\u2019d be posting about how thankful I am that my pigeons aren\u2019t entitled assholes like some humans. Maybe Chantelle should\u2019ve made better choices. \n\nAlso, a pigeon is one of my dream pets!", "NTA. What an entitled idiot.", "NTA - why aren't her super supportive friends putting her up?  You're her cheapest, most convenient, and most easily abused option.  You made the right call.", "***NTA***, now pay the bird tax.  I wanna see the lil\u2019 guys.", "NTA she can\u2019t just show up on your literal door step after not being in communication with you for years now and demand you do anything for her at all. To expect someone to give away their pets for you is insane. And we all know she wasn\u2019t going to pay OP rent if she couldn\u2019t pay her rent for a year and was gonna be homeless with kids while the dad is locked up. Sounds like she needs to fix her life herself.", "Lmao \ud83e\udd23 \n\n\u201cRescue pigeons\u201d.  \n\nI can\u2019t stop laughing at this. \n\nI can\u2019t get through the rest of the post w/o laughing man. But if y\u2019all aren\u2019t together you don\u2019t owe her anything and don\u2019t need to change anything for your rescue pigeons lol.", "NTA.

Just block her and her friends on FB and remember you've done nothing wrong.", "NTA even if you were still close to her. Even if you had reason to believe she would actually pay rent to you when she hasn't for 12 months. Still not an AH for saying no. It's your house. \n\nIts *very* telling that no one closer to her was able/willing to accommodate her. You don't know her recent history, she probably thought that would work in her favour.", "Some random former friend from way back, someone who you \"just kinda know each other,\" is demanding that you get rid of your pets so she and her brood can move into YOUR house... because she hasn't paid rent in a YEAR?\n\nThat would be a very short conversation.\n\nIf she has all these friends that are joining in to blast you, then she obviously already has an extensive support network. They are welcome to take her in.", "NTA... You aren't that good of friends anymore but she expects you to rehome your feather-babies so she can move in, without any prompting on your part? It sounds like you were not the first person to turn her away, because I highly doubt some long-lost friend was her first option when begging for a place to stay.\n\nI hate the situation she is in, life sounds hard for her. But if you don't have the room for your already established (and well-trained and super cool sounding) household, I don't think turning her away to maintain your animals and routines make you an AH at all. I hope she is able to find some peace and shelter.", "NTA and WTF! It's your house. And even if it was a hostel where you take in waifs and strays, you've taken in the birds. There's no room at the inn!!", "NTA. You\u2019re not even friends anymore and she showed up out of the blue. She needs to work on her problems, not deflect them onto someone else.", "She hasn\u2019t paid rent In 12 mos, and do you really think she will magically be able to pay you rent. Do not let her move in and it\u2019s not even about the pigeons . Let her other friends put the money where their mouth is. I love when people won\u2019t help people than blast other people for also not wanting to help. Plus she seems like she is more of a distant friend, where are her close friends with all this.\n\nNta", "NTA even if you didn't have pigeons, you barely know each other and she wants to move in three kids.", "NTA. If her friends feel so strongly, they can take her in themselves.", "Unless it\u2019s your baby NTA", "NTA.  You know she'd never pay you a dime, and try to make you the bad guy when you boot her out.", "NTA. Your place is not a charity house. You have all the right to be with people, pets  or whatever makes you happy.", "NTA. Chantelle's situation is sad for her and especially her kids, but it is not your responsibility. Why can't one of the friend who joined her in slagging you off take her in?", "NTA\n\n\nNot to mention.. she didn't pay rent for 12 months at her last place what makes you think she'll pay rent with you? Just refusing her for that would have been valid.", "NTA.  (1)  It's your house, it's your birds house.  You don't have the space.  (2) If Chantelle could pay you rent, then why couldn't she pay her own rent for the last 12 months?  Her partner was locked up a few months back - but she hasn't paid rent in a year.  Let her stay with her friends who are being assholes.", "NTA\n\nIt is not your responsibility to let anyone live with you.  Period.\n\nHer suggestion to get rid of your pets was entitled and unreasonable.\n\nIf your mutual \"friends\" choose to believe her side of the story unquestioned, it's time for some new friends.\n\nGood Luck", "There was an approximately 0% chance of you ever getting rent from her. You have your life with your birds and your home, and that's amazing. It might be a good idea to block her and her friends or even delete your Facebook if it's not super important to you? Regardless, NTA", "NTA\n\nShe got kicked out for not paying rent for over a YEAR, and then told you she'd definitely pay YOU rent. Does that seem likely to you? You'd end up being trapped in your own home by someone who'd then claim \"I have a newborn you can't kick me out!\" and constantly find another reason to force you to let her occupy your home with her family while contributing nothing.", "NTA...never, never apologize for doing exactly what you want in your own house. Her lack of responsibility is not your burden to bear.", "NTA by a long shot. She just shows up out of the blue and expects a room cleared out and animals given the boot so her and her kids and invade your space? She also hasn't paid rent in a year and all of a sudden she'll pay you? I'm willing to bet she would be the type to try to determine the rent amount and underpay and take advantage of the fact that you were once friends. This is insane behaviour on her part and totally not your problem.", "NTA, funny how her attitude changed when you said no! These are the kinds of people you have to be wary of. They don\u2019t care how your life ends up, as long as they get what they want out of you.", "NTA She doesn't get to judge you on your way of living and demand you change it to accommodate her out of the blue. If her friends can crap on you why didn't they offer to help her then?", "NTA\nYou said you guys aren't even friends, even if you were you don't have to let her live with you even if you didn't have animals blocking the possibility.
