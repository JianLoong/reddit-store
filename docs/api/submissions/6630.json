Her partner was locked up a few months back and she\u2019s about to be evicted because she hasn\u2019t paid rent in 12 months.\n\nOne day, out of the blue, she knocked on my door and started chatting. She told me everything and asked if it would be possible for me to let her move in and she\u2019d pay rent.\n\nI refused saying that I don\u2019t have the room for her and the kids. She told me I could get rid off my birds and they could take the room upstairs.\n\nI said that absolutely not and unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to help her. She freaked out, told me I was a selfish asshole, that I cannot are doing more about animals than humans and a lot of other nasty things. I kicked her out.\n\nI rarely go on Facebook, I have my old one from uni but I rarely go. Not even 24 hours after I kicked Chantelle out, My other friend messaged me to log in to see what\u2019s happenings and Chantelle was slagging me off everywhere. Postings nasty things And her friends joined her and it was just so very nasty.\n\nI do feel bad though and I wonder if they\u2019re right, perhaps I am the asshole here.

NTA.", "NTA why don\u2019t all the people bad mouthing you let her live with them", "NTA.  You aren't obligated to take anyone into your home.  You chose to have pets and it wouldn't be safe to have small children around them.  In addition, this woman hasn't paid rent in 12 months, what makes anyone think she'll pay for you?\n\nI would tell the friends messaging that, since it doesn't work fo her to live with you, please send her their address to move in.", "NTA\u2014you don\u2019t owe Chantelle anything.

Having the extra space doesn\u2019t mean someone else can come along and try to claim it. And this isn\u2019t just one person we\u2019re talking about - it\u2019s FOUR.

Chantelle sounds like nothing but trouble, and you don't need that kind of trouble in your house. Once she moved in, you'd have a very difficult time getting her out. I doubt that she'd pay you a penny or clean up after herself, and you'd probably be expected to take care of her kids. Just block her and her friends and live your best life.

You were a tool to her and now shes mad because you aren't serving her purpose.", "NTA 100%, but I might change my mind if you dont show us this pigeon setup you have going on. Seriously though thats super cool", "NTA... even if you didnt have the cool feathered friends, you were wise to say no. \n1. If she has a situation then it limits whatever emergency services are available to her. \n2. Do you really trust someone that is evicted after 12 months of no payments to pay rent?\n3. Do you want to live with people you dont know or have reason to trust?", "NTA, imagine having to live with her! You dodged a bullet and I imagine her friends are backing her because they'd rather you got rid of the birds so she could live with you because they don't want to live with her either.", "What you have to get rid off is Chantelle.

You did nothing wrong.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThe fact that HER baby daddy is getting locked up and causing her to be evicted is none of your business or responsibility to deal with.\n\nNot your flying monkeys or circus tent.

Not counting the extra cost for food, electricity... I could see how she would have also expected free babysitting/cleaning.\n4- Your birds are your family, you could not just get rid of them.\n\nYou can set record straight on Facebook if you so wish but those friends of hers opinions don't matter.

Not your fault her and her partner are shitty parents who can\u2019t take care of their kids. Good on you for doing so much to make the lives of those birds lovely, if they were in the wild they would\u2019ve died.

No one has the right to just move into your house and take over.  And she was never going to pay you rent.  If she was the kind of person that paid rent, she would not be currently evicted.", "NTA.  She sounds like she has a hard life, but may need to accept responsibility for her part in creating that life. Her FB behavior indicates that is something she struggles with. It's not your responsibility to fix her life.  People who take character references off of someone's random social media posts aren't really people you care about anyhow.", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't pay rent for 12 months and her baby daddy is in prison so she will get no income from him, she is pregnant so is about to have more costs than what she already dose. There's not a chance she would pay you rent.

Forget she even knocked and let her go back to being just a memory from the past.", "If all of her friends take such issue with you, her non-friend, not putting her up they can house her and her children.

Feed the birds, save the birds.", "NTA. And good for you for standing up to this selfish, nasty excuse for a human being.", "NTA- even if you didn't have the pigeons you shouldn't let her move in. She sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. Her reaction proves that you were right not to let her move in (even not considering the pigeons). It would be a nightmare trying to ever get her to move out.
