What I'm not going to do is make a damn scene because I didn't get my way, stomp my little feet and cause issues for him and his wife that weren't there previously.\n\nIdk if you read that part but the GROOM named a groomsman to walk his mom and it wasn't until his mom acted like a toddler that it became a problem. He had no issue with it until she (his child off a mother) made it an issue.\n\nAll that being said, I literally wouldn't give a shit either way, but don't dump this shit in the lap on a stressed bride during the wedding rehearsal (which is usually, at least in my circles, very close to the wedding if not the day before) and then demonize her for not changing plans last minute.", "I\u2019m aware ma\u2019am.
