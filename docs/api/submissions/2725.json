Hell she won\u2019t even see it happening. This is so dumb to be mad about.", "NTA you can ask.. It's not like you demanded it. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds scary lol", "You yourself are NTA but your wife is an A and your mother is a drama queen.  \n\nAnd wedding \u201crules\u201d are stupid. People make up arbitrary \u201ctraditions\u201d that are meaningless in terms of actually helping or hurting people.  What a waste of energy.", "INFO\n\nwhat was your mom like throughout wedding planning? Sobbing at the rehearsal because you aren\u2019t walking her to her seat is ridiculous. It\u2019s not like you denied her a mother son dance is it?", "The only thing that matters in your post is the awful way your fianc\u00e9 spoke to you. It\u2019s your wedding, the day to tie yourself to this woman and her family forever (at least that\u2019s the plan). Is she always so unkind, and so uncaring? NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t know that I have ever seen a groomsman escort the mother of the bride. I\u2019ve seen, sons, fathers, uncles, brothers, and ushers (which are usually close family friends or relatives). I\u2019ve never really viewed this as part of the processional. This happens a few minutes before the wedding starts. The bride won\u2019t even be out there.", "Honey, don't marry this woman. This is your mom and it's not a over the top request. Unless your mom is constantly playing the \"my old child cry cry card\".....but to say that she doesn't have to come is lack of respect for you and your family.   Don't do it.", "Info. \n\nWhat is the time frame here? \n\nIt's a bit dick of you to try and change things last minute if you've been uninvolved this whole time.\n\nLike. A lot of weddings have the timing of who walks who included in the pamphlet things even. \n\nIf the wedding planning is still in Flux and not happening for a few more weeks then there is time to discuss.\n\nBut if you're getting married today, then YTA to try and switch things up.", "NTA!! I\u2019m from the south and every wedding I have ever been to the groom escorts his mother and grandmother to their seat and then takes his place. \nThe fact that the Bridezilla is being so ridiculously controlling to the point of in inviting YOUR mother is a massive red flag!! You may want to take a moment because if she is this unyielding about something so trivial, what is your future going to look like when big decisions need to be made. Is it going to be her way or the Highway?", "NTA. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA  I'm southern, from Georgia, and my ex-husband walked his mom to her seat. He came back and walked my grandma, too.  My mom was walked by the best man. There are no hard and fast rules unless she just wants to be difficult. I would look long and hard at this refusal to compromise. You are in for a miserable marriage if she can't bend over something so small.", "Dude it\u2019s your wedding too! She just didn\u2019t get to bark orders and expect everyone to fall in line or else. I\u2019m wondering what she would say if you told her I walk her down or no Groom. I bet she\u2019d pitch a hissy fit! If she can\u2019t compromise on this imagine how things are going to be in the future. I wish you the best of luck!", "NTA.  Regardless of what normal is.  This is *your* part of *your* wedding.  If you want to walk your mom to her seat then don\u2019t ask permission, tell your partner that you are walking your own mother to her seat.", "NTA for asking but this was is a HUGE red flag that your mother is trying to make this special moment about her instead of the two of you.\n\nI expect to see your wife on JNMIL soon regarding boundary issues you caving to your mother\u2019s tears when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants.\n\nI also wonder how involved you were with the planning process for this to come up at the rehearsal.\n\nWhile I have never seen the groom walk the mother down the aisle, and I certainly did not expect my sons to escort me, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily find it odd. At the same time, I would not have cried to my relatives if something didn\u2019t go as expected.", "Sounds right. The groom should be up the front very very early on so if his mother has to be walked in by him it\u2019s basically not seen by anyone.", "She wants him to walk her down to her seat.", "I\u2019d like to offer a different opinion on why MILs have a tendency to be extra emotional on this subreddit, not that it\u2019s full excuse for poor behaviors. I\u2019m willing to bet that many of the extra emotional MiL are prob impacted by menopause. Age and symptom tracks. \n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that menopause causes a lot of emotional fluctuation and can be really physically taxing for older women.", "My husband and in laws are from Georgia, I\u2019m a New Yorker. His parents are Christian, my mom is Jewish, and we are irreligious. We asked his parents if they would both walk him down the aisle, as both my parents would be walking me down the aisle in Jewish tradition. They were actually thrilled, and so my groom was escorted by his mom and stepdad down the aisle.\n\nI think OP\u2019s bride is rude here.", "Exactly. Born and raised Georgian here with \u201chigh society\u201d roots- this isn\u2019t a hard wedding rule. I\u2019ve attended, and coordinated, plenty of weddings where the groom escorts mom, grandma, etc. then takes their place at the alter. Bride should be behind a door or hidden until her entrance, so groom can do whatever until she comes down the aisle. Your fiance is trying to control this so out of bounds that it\u2019s into disrespectful territory- which is absolutely against code. She\u2019s being RUDE- to you and your mom. Its also your wedding, in case she needs reminding. Its offensive that she\u2019s trying to claim southern \u201cmust-do\u201d. Because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s HER choosing. It\u2019s not a vested part of southern wedding culture or proper etiquette lol \nOverall, she seems *great*, OP. \n\nNTA but good luck with this marriage.", "I don't know about the \"of course\" part if it. \n\nWhere I'm at the typical processional is the mother of the groom with her partner. If the father of the groom is not her partner. (Due to death or divorce) \n\nThe MOB is usually escorted by the Best man. \n\nNow if the MOG does not have a partner in life, then there should have been a discussion about who would be escorting her, well before the rehearsal dinner. \n\nIf it's important to the groom then he should have spoken up prior to this close to the wedding. \n\nBut there is also the order of the processional that's also important. \n\nTypically the groom is up front at the start of the processional. If the brides mother is being seated first. Then there is an empty alter up front. \n\nTo be escorted by the groom, she would have to enter first. Which is an issue if someone wants a typical \"traditional\" wedding. \n\nI'm not big on the \"traditional approach\" but it is important to many people. \n\nI'm not sure the bride is being a \"bridezilla\" since it sounds to me like the groom wasn't really hands on with the whole thing until his mom was crying. \n\nTraditionally (in the US) the grooms family gets much less consideration in the processional and wedding. The brides family being on full display.", "I think you should get to decide this particular part of the procession simply because she's your mother and this is important to you. Maybe you could sit down with your fiancee and explain that you thought escorting mom was something everyone did, which is why you didn't mention it earlier. Remind her that this is your wedding too and that there's nothing wrong with combining the traditions of both families. You will still be waiting for her as she walks down the aisle. She won't even be in the room to see you escorting your mother. \n\nAll that said, your mom overreacted massively and made a big, embarrassing scene. She needs to apologize for that. It was too much. Is this how she normally reacts to not getting her way? This is not a good start to her relationship with your wife.", "So did you let your fianc\u00e9 know this during wedding planning?", "Just saw the edit.", "How else could she manipulate her son? Because if she was so strong about it, she would have talk to them prior to this, buuuut, at the rehearsal she had the audience\u2026.you know\u2026. For her show", "Agree. But it's worse. OP's bride is \"cold.\" To his mother. What are her priorities, OP? NTA", "Although I\u2019ll say, I\u2019d like to hear the brides side. Because if OP was completely uninvolved in the planning of their wedding, then it\u2019s partially on him. My husband was involved in every decision and part of planning. If OP left the task up to his fianc\u00e9e then it\u2019s on him. Why didn\u2019t he know his mother was not being escorted by him until the rehearsal?\n\n\nAlso if OP\u2019s mom has been pushy and difficult for the duration of the relationship or at least wedding planning, I can also see why the bride would be less inclined to be accommodating. \n\nBased on the info given, OP is NTA. But I\u2019m curious about the rest tbh.", "The conflict is that OP's mother started sobbing at the rehearsal dinner because she's not top priority at her son's wedding. \n\nI would be so embarrassed if my mother acting like that at my rehearsal dinner. I think there's some background being left out of the story to make us more sympathetic to OP and his mother", "Well they can\u2019t really do the work if the bride has been planning her weddings since she was young. Wedding are often viewed  and portrayed as the woman dream. The bride mostly want to do everything, and get upset when someone try to give an opinion even if it\u2019s the groom."]}
