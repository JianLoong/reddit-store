School is back online and my son was having a class yesterday and his background was the Isis flag. He noticed and he changed it. The teacher was very angry and demanded that she talk to me after class was over.\n\nThe teacher talked to me about how Isis isn't funny and that we shouldn't joke about terrorism. I told her I apologize for what happened and that I'll deal with it. I asked my son what happened and he told me when he opened up microsoft teams or zoom or whatever (they have multiple programs), that hte Isis flag was there and he has no idea why. We find out that my daughter was calling her friends and they were messing around and forgot to change it back. Since this was an accident I didn't care and I didn't punish my son. I'm also quite angry at the teacher because she yelled at my son for like 5 minutes and didn't even let him explain himself about what happened, which i felt was quite rude and unfair.\n\nToday they had class today and she wanted to talk to me again. She asked me if i punished my son and if i taught him the importance of being sensitive to these issues.  I was so pissed and Iold her that she was a massive bitch for yelling at my son for 5 minutes without even giving him the cahcne to explain himself and that it was an accident, he didn't set the background and had no idea it would pop up and she needs to be better at her job and I hung up. She sent me a massive email, one so long to get to the bottom you need to scroll so i didn't evne bother reading it.\n\nMy husband is annoyed at me becuase he got the same email and he actually read the entire thing and he said w'ere not setting a good example for our kids. Our kids never curse, like ever, so i don't see the issue.\n\nEDIT: since some commentators don't understnad, IT WAS AN ACCIDDENT.

The teacher's reaction is completely understandable and even if your son wasn't the guilty one there is a massive problem in your household if your daughter thinks this is a funny o pass the time.", "Info: Why would your daughter be calling her friends on your son's school teams account?", "INFO What consequences has your daughter faced for her prank?", "YTA you could have easily explained the situation but instead you acted childish and insulted a teacher for an appropriate response.

You needed to handle the teacher better and just explain that you spoke to him, and he didn't set the background, but you are dealing with the child who did, and you're sorry it happened during her lesson. Instead, you chose to go nuclear on her and resort to childish name calling and cursing because that always helps a situation.", "YTA\n\nYour absolute ignorance about this issue is amazing, really. Neither what you daughter does nor what your son does is funny or anything. Messing around with symbols of terror organization isn\u2018t a joke.\nIt\u2018s a lack of sentivity towards this topic that you\u2018ve missed as parents, to bring up to your kids. You are the problem here, not the teacher. \nReally Ma\u2018am you should have had listen to the teacher, understand what she said and don\u2018t whining around how unfair it is. Buhu. \nYou\u2018re an adult, behave like one!

The exposure to ISIS in the vast majority of the world is in terms of the horror. Anyone who has heard about ISIS would have heard about it in conjunction with horrors. This would be particularly so if you had done the work you say you have because your children would have been exposed to your negativity about ISIS, even if that was curated appropriately for children. So for a child to then think ISIS is a joking matter is gobsmackingly bizarre to me. \n\nYour analogy to Genghis Khan does not hold. Genghis Khan is an historical figure; ISIS is a current issue. Also, no, we still do NOT make jokes about the nazis and again, the fact that you say that makes me question your morality and also your claim of humanitarian work. As an aside, I do not agree with jokes about matters that harm people full stop, whether they are historical or current, but you are completely ignoring that a joke about Genghis Khan could realistically come out of complete ignorance but one about ISIS should not.\n\nI understand the teacher\u2019s reaction, not just to your son, but to you, because in your post and comments you are making light of this situation and treating it as no big deal. It is a HUGE deal. I can see that the teacher not only had to be outraged by this when it happened, but is not seeing your son or you recognize the significance of it. \n\nYTA, many times over. It\u2019s very clear to me that your daughter was messing around with this because she has grown up in a household that dismisses the realities of ISIS. You have a responsibility to educate your children about why making light of these things and treating them as no big deal or worse, a joking matter, is not on. You haven\u2019t done that.", "YTA.

Clearly you are raising the kinds of kids that would find that funny, since your daughter did it. Instead of disrupting her class further she went to you and followed up. And honestly \u201ci don\u2019t know how that got there, it just have been my sister\u201d SOUNDS like a lie. You respond by screaming at and berating this woman who is trying to teach in difficult circumstances. You shouted obscenities at her.\n\nParents like you are why we have a teacher shortage. It\u2019s just not worth dealing with you anymore.", "YTA- you have bigger problems than a teacher bitching at your son. Some schools will expel students because of this.  You\u2019re lucky you only got berated, I hope the teacher pursues this further.", "YTA Your son needed a fierce reaction. There\u2019s no way he entered the meeting without noticing the IS flag in the background. He left it it there on purpose. Both your daughter and your son need a stern talk and an appropriate punishment.

Don\u2019t know what the policy is where you live, but if there is a similar one perhaps teach your daughter and son what kind of consequences this can have. \n\nThe teacher reacted appropriately.

Your son did nothing wrong. Edit: Idk why people keep downvoting NTAs as the op said that it was not their son's fault and he immediately changed it when he realised", "NTA, teacher is probably overworked and oversensitive. But 'punishment' is not the right response to an honest mistake. You did the right thing.", "ESH You for insulting the teacher and berating her, and her for mettling in your household affairs. She has no right to know if and how you punish your child, and simply asking was highly unprofessional imo. Your response, however, was also unprofessional. You should have simply said something along the lines of \"You're not entitled to that information\" and MAYBE report the incident to the principal, your reaction was way over the top, even if she lectured your son for 5 minutes in front of all his peers, stooping to her level was not the move.", "Teacher sounds like the AH in this situation, or maybe the daughter for filming terrorists videos between school sessions \ud83d\ude02.  \n\nIt would be unreasonable to punish your son for an accident and the Teacher should be embarrassed for jumping the gun and reaching conclusions without all the facts. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As long as you spoke to your daughter and told her why this was not acceptable, you acted appropriately.", "NTA. Your son didn't intentionally do this so any punishment would be pointless. You may want to have a word with your daughter, I guess, but even then, I feel like words will probably suffice.\n\nTeacher seems like quite the AH though.", "ESH, the teacher was TA for not asking questions before going off, you are TA for calling the teacher a bitch, and your daughter is probably T-biggest-A for \u201ejoking\u201c about something that\u2019s so incendiary. \n\nI\u2019d be most curious to find out what your daughter found funny about it?", "I think it\u2019s kinda funny.

Perhaps take it over the teacher's head to the principal.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher yelling for 5 minutes at your son without letting him explain justifies your actions. It's aggressive behavior towards the child.

Unfortunately it\u2019s a byproduct of the school systems to react that harshly", "NTA.\n\nBut you should talk to your daughter.", "NTA. Teacher was still over-stepping her bounds, regardless. Whether a student is punished to the teachers standard is not their business. The audacity to even ask that is mind-blowing to me. I may have had a similar reaction myself based on that alone.", "NTA.

I was born near the end of communism in my country and I always joke about communist stuff as a kid and teenager. A few times adults heard it and they lost their shit and went off about the horrors of communism.  I'm sure those people made jokes about nazis and hteir parents yelled at them about what they faced under nazism etc. This is just something kids do. The way we view hitler and the nazis is how people viewed Napeoleon like 150 years ago before the Nazis. For hundreds of years, Europeans and middle easterners viewed peolpe from Central Asia, tatars, Mongolians, Kazakhs (Turkic people, I don't think they were \"kazakhs\" back then) the same way for killing 1/10 of the world's population.

Maybe she should have given this information before but again, this is not an excuse to blame a teacher for the misbehaving of the children. When OP knows everything so well, why don\u2018t OP say ok, teacher is right, explain it to the teacher and punish the daughter who maee this \u201eprank\u201c. No OP yells at the teacher who point at the problem.", "Ok hold on a  minute, it is OP's responsibility to include important information. We all react to the post...", "Seems like you don't know either. ISIS were not a thing in 2001. Then the US invaded the wrong country, Saudi Arabia got away scot free", "I didn\u2019t see that part omg \ud83d\ude02 that hilarious. \nIt\u2019s not even good fiction at all it\u2019s just silly.", "And how does that mean its fake? I work for the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO). They have been in Syria for quite a while. We also work with the International Rescue COmmittee, Doctors without borders among other gruops.", "Yes I agree. Echo the organization she claims to work for has no employees on the ground. They exclusively work through partners in Syria. Neither would anyone actually working in this field talk about ISIS anymore. It\u2019s referred to by Da\u2019esh for a long time already.", "Boundaries can be set without yelling and without being aggressive.\n\nThe child's intent is relevant because if the child did it on purpose and if they were supporting ISIS that would be a serious issue that would need to be addressed. \n\nBtw how are you even supposed to teach children which flag symbolizes what if you don't show the flag to them in the first place?", "I did humanitarian work in Syria for a few months at a time every year between 2012-2016. Spent a few months in Iraq as well. I was mostly doing medical work there. We were targeted a few times by Isis and likely other groups too. I saw people get shot, burned and I treated rape victims. These people were fucking savages and I hope they all rot in hell. \n\nMy anger and frustration towards the teacher is that she yelled at my son for 5 minutes about soemthign he didn't do and didn't give him a chance to explain himself. That was not fair. If she just let him explain it was an accident, he could change it and move on. I gave my daughter a stern talk about the seriousness of this stuff and I told ehr about what I saw in Syria. She didn't do this as a prank to her brother, she was messing around with her friends. I told her about how this can really offend and traumatize people and she needs to be careful about the audience of her jokes are and how they can anger the wrong people. I have a Yazidi friend who talked to her about Isis, she knows people who were murdered by htem.", "Right here >Isis is a very fucking real issue and idc what the fuck was happening your daughter shouldn't joke about it, the teacher is right, \n\nYeah I know, better than anyone in this threat. I lived in Syria and was doing humanitarian work. I got shot at.and saw people get blown up. \n\nI explained to my daughter why its not funny and I told her abotu what i saw. I didn't punish her but we had a stern talk abot it.", "The son did NOT misbehave!!!", "Still proves my point that us Americans don't know shit about the people who perpetrated one of the biggest attacks on our soil", "A person who had those experiences wouldn't be so flippant about their kids effing around with symbols of a terrorist organization. Given the seriousness of the aid work, and by extension the aid workers, it defies credulity that a person with that resume would be so flippant about her children playing games with an ISIS flag. There is zero chance that such a person would be hyper focused on the teacher's dressing down of her child rather than the act itself. I would also expect a person with that background to understand how Zoom and similar programs work, you have to approve a background before joining a meeting. The child's explanation in this bit of fiction doesn't hold water and a person who has themselves attended many meetings on these platforms would know that.", "That simply cannot be true. ECHO employees themselves are not active in Syria. They exclusively provide aid through partners on the ground.", "Who said that anyone was aggressive?", "And yet your daughter still jokes about ISIS. Clearly she doesn't care about how serious it is.", "That is true. Not my soil. Bit embarrassing when the British know more about Americas most notorious moment than the Americans do. And we don't talk about it everyday", "Yelling at a child is aggressive. Aggression doesn't have to be physical.", "You are taking the lying isis Flag waving child at his word?"]}
