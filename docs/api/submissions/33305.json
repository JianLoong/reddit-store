During a family get-together, SIL was telling me and MIL about her upcoming ultrasound where she will find out the gender of the baby. She said she wanted to know the gender to determine the vibe of the nursery. I asked her if she would be having a gender reveal party because of how common they are these days not thinking anything of it. But, SIL got visibly upset and gave me a massive side-eye. I didn't think much of it but then she started asking me if I was serious, and I kinda got confused and said \"yea? Or I guess are you telling anyone or leaving it a surprise?\" She scoffed and said she hated gender reveal parties and they were super dramatic and ridiculous for no good reason. I understand it's not for everyone, but I felt I had offended her somehow. She said she would just tell people the gender instead of advertising it like some parade. The rest of the evening was okay and I didn't get any weird vibes from her after.\n\nLater, when my husband (26) and I got home, he asked me what I had spoken with his sister about cuz she had mentioned to him that I was being immature and told her she needed to have a reveal party. I felt a lil defensive and said I was only making conversation. SIL has a history of exaggerating details so we kinda shrugged and hoped she wasn't too mad about it.\n\nThe next day, MIL called me to ask me to apologize to SIL for making her uncomfortable and causing her to lose sleep which might hurt the baby. I was really confused but I didn't wanna ruffle more feathers so I agreed to phone her and apologize. Now I am wondering if I am missing something or if it's rude to ask that cuz at 21 idk too many pregnant women and if that's something weird to ask. For context, SIL and I aren't close but friendly. I have always kinda gotten a cold vibe from her which makes me a bit sad cuz I don't have siblings myself and would like to see her as a sister, but obviously can't force that kinda bond.", "created_utc": 1702932167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lizu8/aita_for_asking_my_sil_if_she_will_have_a_gender/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Additionally, you say that you've always felt a cold vibe from SIL so you don't know what's her deal and I guess that that situation was an excuse she needed to make you the black sheep.

We'll just tell people.\"  It's fine to dislike something, but it's not fine to take that dislike out on someone asking a simple question, which is why I'm wondering if there might have been more to what you said to her.

As someone who was also your SIL's age when I had my first, and who is also strongly against gender reveal parties, she had a very overblown reaction. Even the way she addressed it to you in person was rude (unless you guys are super close - which I would guess you are not) but saying she's losing sleep over someone simply asking if she was going to have a party is just...dramatic? Also, SIL is gonna have to toughen up, because as a parent she is going to be asked far more difficult questions than \"are you planning a gender reveal party.\"", "Most definitely NTA so don\u2019t lose any sleep in thinking you are.

You are not immature for acting your age.  How are you supposed to know any of this?  Frankly different generations do things differently.  There are plenty of grandparents who are also learning.\n\nHer MIL is out of line and incorrect.  Lack of sleep will not hurt the baby.  The farther along she gets, she will be losing more sleep because of the need to use the bathroom all the time.  I suggest for sensitive SIL (normal for pregnant women) that you send a little note.  Maybe something along the lines of \u201cI am so happy about your baby!  I understand I may have irritated you with my questions, but please know that I am trying to learn.  I want to be the best possible aunt and welcome any education or coaching.  Please let me know how I can be helpful because I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m happy to cook and clean if that is what you need.  Do you need help with thank you notes?\u201d\n\nThe biggest mistake people make after a baby is born is to expect to help by holding the baby.  What pregnant and new moms need is real help for everything else.  It is very hard to cook, clean, laundry, etc.  There are a lot of gifts given, but no time to write notes, address envelopes, get to the post office.  Anything you can do to support her will be appreciated and hopefully will draw you closer.  If she is smart, she should recognize that you could be a great babysitter once she feels able to leave her baby.  Clearly NTA.", "NTA if all you did was ask. You didn't tell her and she's way overreacting so you don't owe her an apology.\n\nAnd I say that as someone who thinks those parties are stupid. But damn, you can still make conversation. All she had to do was say \"nah, I don't think it's worth making a big deal out of it and will just tell people.\"", "NTA. You asked a question. A question I'm sure she's going to be asked over and over.", "I guess you dont need a party to be \"dramatic and ridiculous\".\nThis is a massive over reaction.

How the hell were you supposed to know her reaction and to have a bad sleep about it? Dumb. Your MIL, SIL, and your husband (guilt by associating) can all suck donkey dicks. Shrug it off, and move forward. Your hubs better have your back on this and any future conflicts. Good luck.", "NTA. It was a valid question.

Personally I\u2019m not really into gender reveals but I\u2019ve been to a few now.

I do think it\u2019s fair you apologize for upsetting her but I think it\u2019s ridiculous that her mother called to ask you to do so. SIL could have also used that as a teachable moment to bond with you while explaining her dislike of gender reveals and this whole situation could have been avoided.", "Gender reveal parties are a recent fad and imo tacky. It's mostly a social media thing on how dramatic the reveal can be. The person who started the trend just had a colored cake. Now, people rent planes, set off fireworks, dump dye in waterfalls (just to name some egregious reveals), causing massive environmental damage, destruction of property due to fires, and even deaths, including one of the parents in some cases. \n\nHaving a party to announce the gender is rather juvenile. It can be announced at a shower, or at birth. It sounds like you did more than mention having one. Possibly asking why not? Which is being pushy. It's not your pregnancy or baby. Apologize and keep your nose out unless you are invited in.

It's nice to hear OP is keen to just keep the peace and won't let this bother them too much though.", "Thank you! Noted for next time haha I will def just ask if they are keeping it a secret instead. As a zoomer on tiktok im seeing reveal parties everywhere and thought it was just a chill party like a baby shower. Oops.", "I literally know her SIL in person, she makes an EXCEL SHEET of a gift list where she can track who gives what gifts in CATAGORIES. Woman is a literal TOOL \ud83d\udc80", "Maybe yea! I think that might be it. I just hope it doesn't get dragged on further haha", "Wait til she has to actually BIRTH the baby, will the Nurse have to apologize for telling her to push??", "Unfortunately thats a valid concern on here ahha. But yea the exact thing i said was \"Would you do a gender reveal party\" then after her saying they're dramatic and ridiculous, and that she would just tell us when she finds out, i said something along the lines of \"Thats exciting, hope it all goes well at the appointment\" and then we kinda mingled in diff groups but no bad vibes. We hugged goodbye (we are a hug everyone hello and goodbye family) and that was all. But yea there's been incidents like this in the past, and my husband has assured me that its not a me thing. I didnt know gender reveals were so polarizing tho so im glad i posted here. Lesson learnt hehe", "No.", "Or we can let people enjoy things.", "I don't think I meant to ask her to have one. For context, she was hoping to get Christmas presents to help furnish the nursery, so since the theme for it was gonna be selected based on the sex of the baby, I asked \"Would you have a gender reveal party?\" cuz of how common they are on the interwebs and as a way of letting us know what to get for the baby and stuff.", "This is clearly an NTA, not E-S-H. OP didn't know SIL was gonna flip her shit over the idea of a gender reveal party. OP didn't know that SIL was gonna likely spin some bullshit with her family about it and cause the actual undue drama. They're cringey, but still common enough to wonder if one is gonna happen when someone mentions determining which equipment the child will be born with. \n\nMaybe OP could have handled the initial push back better, but SIL needs to check her own head first.", "Yea dude i didnt know it was so polarizing. Definitely, will remember for next time though. Not many ppl in like my friend group are at the stage of having kids and stuff so I didnt even know its a cringe thing oops.", "OP didn't suggest, they asked.", "Definitely did not ask why not. After she said she would let us know the gender, I said something along the lines of that's exciting, hope the appointment goes well. But yeah the comments def gave me insight. I have never really thought much about reveal parties and only asked as a conversation continuer? haha I dunno. Lesson learnt tho, thank you :)", "People have dumped dye into streams so a waterfall will turn a certain color, regardless of if the dye is toxic to the fish living in the stream. Countless fires, including some major wildfires, were caused by fireworks or explosives to announce gender. People have *died* because of gender reveals, including the soon to be parents. All so people could know a little sooner how exactly the kid pees.\n\n\nSo yeah, gender reveals are dumb.", "They do have a hate club, so to speak. Two reasons for that.\n\nThe first is that it will get awkward real quick if the child turns out to be trans. Gender reveal parties can be best described as sex reveal parties, which is a bit less appealing. Fun fact: the one who did the first gender reveal party, Jenna Karvunidis, has become opposed to them. Her child is gender non-conforming, the irony. \n\nThe second is that people are\u2026people. And as gender reveals are big parties with a big announcement, some have gone overboard. There have been accidents that have endangered the guests, their neighborhood and the environment. Look it up. \n\nSo yeah, while I understand that parties are fun and a baby is a reason for celebration, there are issues with gender reveals in particular.", "Even the original person who started the whole gender reveal has been begging people to STOP doing it.", "Sounds like SIL might have a personality disorder", "Gender reveals have gotten way out of hand and are just plain stupid. They are a combination of Instagram moments and companies trying to market crap.", "I think it\u2019s mostly Reddit people who \u201chate\u201d it trying to be edgy. I won\u2019t be having one when my wife is pregnant, mainly cus I don\u2019t see the need, but I certainly don\u2019t \u201chate\u201d them.", "They do because they're stupid. But honestly asking if someone is going to have a gender reveal party could simply be a polite way to gage how stupid the hormones have made the pregnant person. \nAsking about having one might just mean the asker is trying to figure out how much they're going to have to grin and bear.", "In addition to what everyone else has said, to me it seems a little excessive to have multiple parties for a pregnancy (gender reveal, baby shower). And I\u2019m pretty extra, lol", "It's so weird. Like instead why not just get to the point and have dick balloons or vagina decorations? I don't think I'll ever understand why people just go around announcing their genitals to everyone. \n\nYou're NTA for asking though. She's the AH for getting that upset about it instead of just saying no", "While I agree wholeheartedly on the stupidity of GRP\u2019s, I agree that NTA. However, a reaction in line with this can be something upsetting as it sounds passive aggressive. Still, sounds like a massive overreaction from your entire in-law family.", "Facts, I have strong feelings against gender reveal parties. Was asked this and had to control my response as the person meant no harm even when they were wide-eyed and shocked we weren\u2019t doing one. Emotional control is still possible when interacting with others, just more challenging. SIL has no excuse and sounds like an ass.", "Oh no that must have been awful. Yea for sure, thats kinda why im just gonna apologize and like try to move forward. Baby and her are top priority foshoo", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 relatable", "Dude you replied to yourself.", "No.", "She'll probably do a registry for that.", "They are only popular on the 'interwebs' and social media. Where they are frequently dumpster fires. Having a bit of awareness on them tells you how toxic and physically damaging they have become. Asking about it is putting pressure on her to have one. Just let her tell you the gender or get gender neutral cloths!", "Yea haha, I've been overthinking ab what I could've said as a follow-up instead. But i thought she didn't hear me right at first tbh :') so i was like \"yea, ..\" which may seem like doubling down aaa.", "The origin story behind gender reveal parties is gives needed context for them. It was a celebration of making it to the anatomy scan for the first time. I can't hate on anyone trying to deal with pregnancy loss. Like, don't burn down a forest but I will never say no to a party and a cake. You are NTA and neither are people who throw a little party with their loved ones.", "Those are both super valid reasons! Thank you for letting me know the lore.", "It's really a genital reveal party rather than gender...\n\nMy understanding is the woman who first held one had several miscarriages, and the ultrasound that revealed the baby's sex was an important milestone in her pregnancy being viable, so she celebrated it that way. But they've become OTT and trashy, and the idea behind them is pretty questionable.\n\nI wouldn't want to have one, but I also wouldn't react so strongly and claim it's losing me sleep!", "Honest question, but why would it be awkward if the child is trans? Would you not tell anyone the kid\u2019s gender until they\u2019re old enough to decide for themself? Not trying to be snarky, genuinely curious why it would be awkward, especially since them coming out as trans would conceivably happen years later and I doubt anyone would think \u201coh weird, they had a gender reveal party over a decade ago saying something else.\u201d", "The third reason being that these reveals often happen in public spaces like parks, and involve creating a LOT of trash that can be hazardous for the local ecosystem. I can\u2019t tell you how many reveal parties I have seen that have left their massive messes all over the park without cleaning up at least minimally.", "Eh. Babies aren't Trans, so that's not valid. A gender reveal is no different than naming a baby in tje sense that they can change it later if they choose to. But the damage caused by reveals has been massive.", "Doesn\u2019t matter the SIL is a witch for the way she reacted! The OP is not the AH", "I thought they were stupid but suddenly I\u2019m starting to see the merits", "I think they are ridiculous too, but a child one day developing a mental illness isn't a reason not to have them", "The one who takes credit for doing the first party. They were done long before that rando", "Werent those wild fires in California caused by a gender reveal party gone wrong a few years back. I would say millions in property damage and lives lost is a good reason to hate them.", "Huh. Wtf.", "Ty this is super reassuring. Ik some ppl take gender reveals too far and like those gender reveal fails etc. but I guess imo a small party seems similar to a bridal shower. Again, I'm super new to having discussions about babies, marriage, etc so maybe i'll play it safe going forward and just say like \"Thats exciting\" or something like that :)", "Also there's numerous videos out there featuring the parents of the unborn baby finding out the gender and one or both of them have a VERY visible negative reaction to it.", "At least 4 known direct fatalities, massive river contamination in Brazil, multiple explosions, and some of the largest wildfires...\n\nImagine having to explain to your kid that a car doing donoughts in the street with colored smoke, turned grandma into road pizza?  \n\nhttps://www.todaysparent.com/blogs/trending/gender-reveal-parties-that-ended-in-tragedy/\n\nThat said, as a trans person, she's being a little ridiculous, like pregnancy makes you.\n\nNAH, maybe just bite the dumb bullet though?", "The scans can also be wrong. My parents were told they would have 2 sons and a daughter. They got 3 girls.", "'Let's launch all these confetti cannons, get our pictures, then go home!' It's such a mess.", "0.07-0.05 percent of babies are born intersex.... So I agree, using trans as a reason is so stupid. So what do you just call your child a they until they become a teenager? No wonder kids are so confused.... \n\nBut I agree, you often see one parent freak out if it isn't the sex they want, etc. When you should just be celebrating that you're having a healthy child. \n\nThe whole idea is just a way to make everyone spend more money, and it's pretty incredible how well some marketing companies are, that they even made this a thing.", "Plenty of babies are born intersex and the parents have to choose their gender.", "I would say it\u2019s a better reason to hate irresponsibly thrown parties on the whole right? Not to demonize one subsect of parties because of an irresponsible one thrown. Otherwise I\u2019d question why you specifically chose gender reveal in spite of all the other irresponsible acts committed by other parties you don\u2019t hate.", "Had to give y'all the update", "Which has now been preserved forever. Wouldn't it be great, growing up knowing your parent cried because you weren't what they wanted? And getting to see the video evidence?", "That's awful omg. I never thought much about em tbh just what i seen on like tiktok and one distant cousin having one earlier in the year. Definitely gonna apologize tho cuz baby and her health are top priority. :)", "Before my daughter and her husband decided to remain child-free, we had a running joke that if they decided to have a gender reveal party, the big color reveal would show...lavender! :)", "Yes!!!! They found my daughter at 22 weeks. She was laying perfectly lined up with her brother and we never saw her!!!! 3 ultrasounds!!! Was also told she was a boy ... Until 3 days before they were born. 26 weeks. Boy, girl. We lost my son but my little surprise just turned 16!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Her daddy is a girl dad all the way and it makes me so happy!!!!

Point being they seem to cause alot of damage for a party based solely on what visible organ is between your child's legs when its a largely either or option.", "Gender disappointment is a thing - I had it. I was pregnant with my 3rd child and already had two sons. When I first found out at the ultrasound, I cried. I really wanted a girl. After 5 minutes I was over it and just happy my baby was healthy and happy. Now I love being a boy mom.\n\nI don\u2019t blame anyone for a quick, unexpected reaction of disappointment. It\u2019s a real thing. We only see a quick glimpse - maybe 30 seconds later they\u2019re fine.\n\nHaving said that, I can\u2019t stand gender reveal parties and am glad they weren\u2019t a thing when I had my kids (22, 21, 19). I think showing off your kid\u2019s genitalia is just weird.\n\nNTA OP - you asked a question. You did not interrogate, badger, or demand. You asked a question. SIL is an overdramatic tattle tale. Just keep her at arms length.", "NTA. It was an innocent question. She could have just said it's not her thing and move on. Losing sleep, my ass. She wanted to create drama to keep attention on her and discredit you. I'm afraid this is not the sister you were looking for. I'd keep her at arms length in future. Never have conversations that aren't witnessed by others. I know it sounds extreme, but something else is at play here.", "Honey you have nothing to apologize for! What you asked wasn\u2019t bad and all she had to say was \u201cno\u201d Don\u2019t be so nice. She needs to apologize to you!", "Please don\u2019t apologize. This is the dumbest thing I have heard! She did NOT lose sleep over this. My god.", "I was a dangerous pregnancy. As in, my mom was told 'either this baby comes out now and we hope they can breathe, or you both die' levels of dangerous. HELLP syndrome born a bit more than 2 months premature. My dad, on the few baby videos they have, was so happy that everyone lived that he's glowing, even when he's just sitting by my incubator in the NICU. Same with my mom once she recovered. I looked like a naked mole rat covered in tubes. My dad still says I was a beautiful baby, because I was his little girl and decided to stay awhile. \n\nOver 30 years later and his little girl is becoming a man, but he still is glad I stayed awhile and let him get to know me.

I do agree with hating on poorly run parties, however.", "My father had 3 daughters. As an adult, I'm sure there was a moment or 2 of regret. But he *never* made any of us feel like we weren't exactly what he wanted. My mom was always the one who joked about the doctors telling her she had 2 sons. \n\nAsking about having a gender reveal is slightly close to asking if you are going to circumcise. It's personal and not your business unless and until you are invited.", "Your now taking it too far - it\u2019s not a personal question. God some women are way too over dramatic and over sensitive! Good god!", "How is your child's gender pre-birth not a personal question? No one needs to know. It will be announced at the birth. Any sharing before that is at the parents' discretion."]}
