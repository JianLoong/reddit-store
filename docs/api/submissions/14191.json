Just because its not my friend, and it made it awkward for other guests. I would have talked to my partner and asked why tf they are friends with ppl like this but I mean hey she opened herself up to it so hey", "NTA\n\nI think airing this stuff in public, esp the dude's (alleged) appearance/sexual performance and stuff is trashy and she deserves to be called out on it. Nobody wants to hear it.\n\nAnd yeah, you're right, it's easy to see the dude you're with as a \"real man\" when he's not providing for her.", "Eh she clearly didn't care to have any tact or decorum when talking the way she was.\n\nSounds like she meant to be having girl talk and should've done it when you weren't around. \n\nGonna go with ESH\n\nYou didn't talk to her about partner shaming or anything like that, or how the term \"real man\" can be damaging to the mental wellbeing of growing and grown men, vis a vis toxic masculinity and such as. \n\nYou specifically targeted and attacked her specific life circumstances. You went for the jugular.", "ESH. What an awful group of people.", "ESH. This is a situation where two things can be right at the same time. She shouldn't have siad what she did about her ex, but  she is your wifes friend so maybe that is why she felt comfortable complaining about her ex because mistakely thought she was among friends. The world is full of people who talk crap about their exs with their friends. The problem is you are not her friend. So she should have saved talking about her ex to when she knew she was truly amoung her friends. I don't like what she said about her ex either. However I would have just said the conversation is making me uncomfortable and request that we change the subject. There was no need for you to say what you did to her. You said it because you don't like the woman. None of us truly knows what goes on in someone else relationship because we aren't there for conversation or interaction. You seem to have some strong opinions about her not working without providing any context for what their agreement was as a married couple.  Was she a stay at home mom? Did they have an agreement that she wouldn't work and raise the kids or take care of the house. Did the husband change his mind.", "NTA.

This was one of those times.", "NTA, ok fr wtf is a real man? like people just throw around when you have a perfectly good male partner taking care of your needs. yea they might not treat you like a queen but guess what queens go down with the monarchy. Seriously, they wonder why their new guys considered a \"real man\" treat them like shit. truthfully a \"real man\" wouldn't even take that kind of abuse of being insulted. I'm just happy the ex-husband lost 100 pounds of dead weight because sounds like that's what the friend is.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly like the husband better. Problem is you didn\u2019t defend him, you attacked her", "Esh. You don't know their marriage issues. An appropriate response \"I'm glad this is working out for you! So how about that weather, huh?\"", "NTA but sometimes its best to let people like her just flap their lips... she was looking for validation and you gave it to her.\n\nNext time, reject the invite to go out anywhere that she'll be...", "Yta jesus christ. You have zero idea what actually happened in their relationship. Perhaps she is heartbroken and this is her way to cope. Either way the dude wasnt there so why the mra jargon to purposefully ruin a night and make things more awkward. Have some tact change the subject. Act like you are civilized next time.", "YTA. This whole post reeks of misogyny. You admit you don\u2019t really know him but you\u2019ve already decided the issue is her because she wasn\u2019t \u2018putting effort into her appearance\u2019 or making her \u2018own money\u2019. You know nothing about their relationship dynamic or what went on behind closed doors but you\u2019ve decided the gold digging fat lazy woman is the issue.", "Seriously she shouldn't be talking about stuff like that with her friends", "all honestly people like the friend are the people that most likely will cheat on their partners.", "She was for a while her kids are older now though, and the guy had vented at a while back to a closer friend while I was present that had been asking her to go back to work or school for a while to help out.", "Have tact? She literally brought up the guys penis size at the table and made fun of him playing pickle ball as a hobby. Like fuck him for not liking something cooler am I right lol", "Why does anyone have to hear about it though?\n\nIt's just bad etiquette. It's nobody's business and nobody asked.", "Lol a post about a women making fun of a guys penis is misogyny, I\u2019m totally sure if this was a post of an exhusband talking about his exs tits and vag and a woman calling him out you would 100% call it misandry by the woman totally not a double standard here", "This! OP tone is full of resentment when he talks about this woman not working. OP is acting like he was the one that had to work to support her. Also nobody knows what truly goes on in someone else marriage.", "At least you won't ever see her again I'm sure your wife can find new friends if you allow it", "Yes literally have tact. Just bc shes being horrible you have to be overemotional right back? Just say thats not cool lets change the subject and move on. If she starts getting angry remove yourself and go elsewhere to have a good night.", "Well first off not every criticism of a women is misogynist. People are able to be criticized for their actions separate of their genders. Also it\u2019s not personal but it did rub me the wrong way because I know for a fact the ex had been asking for a long time that she help out and she didn\u2019t put forth the effort to alleviate any of the burden from him and instead waited until they got a divorce to go back to work. Kind of a fucked up thing to do to someone who is supposed to be your partner.", "You seem strangly fixation on this one aspect of someone else's marriage. I'm starting to think you didn't really have a problem with what she said you just saw it as your excuse to lash out at this woman because she wouldn't work.", "For real this comment section is ridiculous and op is real emotional about shit that has nothing to do with him.", "Man calls out women for misandry. Reddit readers accuse OP of misogyny.\n\nIf you had said ESH you could have had a leg to stand on. But you didn't. You chose to show your own prejudice \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. \n\nJust because misogyny exists doesn't make you not the AH for your misandrist views \ud83d\ude1a", "Women \u2615\nNta of course.", "Yeah, if this was going to be a moment to call her out, it should have been on the use of the term \"real man\".
