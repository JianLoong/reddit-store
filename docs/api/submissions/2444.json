I agreed, he asked me if I needed to use the restroom before I went cause he knows the drive home is about 40-50 minutes. \n\nIt was considerate of him to ask that, and I said yes, I went into his bathroom and realized that it was the start of my period, I didn\u2019t bleed much and I was desperately looking for anything to use. I opened the sink cabinet to find my brother's ex-wife's period pads. I know he told me not to touch it but the first day of my period is always a heavy flow and I couldn't just use toilet paper. \n\nI opened the period pack and used one, thinking he wouldn't figure it out. My brother had always been observant and about two days after that though he sent me a pic of the period pad pack open and started getting mad. I responded that I undoubtedly needed a period pad at that time. \n\nHe told me his ex-wife was coming to get everything and she \u201cneeded every period pad\u201d because she didn't have much money.\n\nI feel like that wasn't my problem but maybe I could have handled it better. \n\n\nSMALL NOTE :\nThis period was an early one and it was unexpected at least", "created_utc": 1668570641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywiwi0/aita_for_using_my_brother_exwifes_period_pads/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't read his mind, or whether he's just making excuses for wanting all of her stuff to be weirdly the same as it was when she left it, so ask him what it will take to make it right.

He\u2019s clearly grieving the loss of his relationship and is not in the best frame of mind.", "NTA\n\nOne pad, one box of pads, who cares. She should be glad your brother is even letting her come get her stuff. If it were me I wouldn't have even remembered that I left pads in his bathroom, I'd be more worried about my clothes and valubles. And what's one pad going to save you, a few cents? If they dont stop bothering you just give them a single pad in return and be done with it.", "NTA. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous.

Your brother doesn't get it. I'm sure his ex will understand. Almost every person on the planet that has a period understands this situation and only a crazy AH would begrudge you that. You could offer to buy her a small pack or venmo some cash with a thank-you note.", "NTA he\u2019s stressed out and this is misplaced aggression.", "NTA. Seriously, he's upset over one pad? She would have said yes if you'd asked her. Isn't that pretty standard?", "NTA\n\nWTF is this shit", "You can pay her back the pad. TP instead of an actual feminine hygiene product is gross. Why risk ruining your clothes because of a surprise period? NTA", "NTA\n\nPeriod products stand outside of the regular rules. \n\nIt's a bit like toilet paper or water (necessities). You wouldn't expect to denied them in a family members house.\n\nAlso, yes the period (pink) tax is a thing, and I really feel for bros ex. But I doubt another woman would deny you a pay in your situation. We've all been there.\n\nFurther, super odd of your brother to police your period? I'd be so uncomfortable if my brother did that. If he feels SO strongly about her items, he could reimburse her. What did he want you to do instead? Bleed through your clothes?", "NTA any person who wouldn\u2019t share a pad for someone in need is TA. \n\nWould he count the squares of toilet paper and get mad that you used some? It\u2019s generally accepted that if you have a guest in your house they\u2019re going to have to use some of your things. You were unexpectedly in need and he can\u2019t seriously expect you to have driven home bleeding all over yourself and your car. \n\nAs someone who has periods you should probably plan to always have a pad in your bag, car, etc. just in case, but what\u2019s done is done.", "NAH.

That being said, I  absolutely would have done the same thing if I was in your shoes.", "soft yta\n\nit seems ridiculous to count period pads when someone says dont touch anything, but the fact that you tried to hide it makes you a little bit TA.  he may not care but his ex might, and now has ammo to use against him, however petty. \n\nif you had just told him and offered to replace it, he probably would\u2019ve said not to worry about it, and then you wouldn\u2019t look like you were trying to be sneaky", "YTA, I understand needing a pad in an emergency, but you took it and didn\u2019t tell your brother. You should have gone to him after and explained the emergency. \n\nAnd when you said that the situation wasn\u2019t your problem\u2026 child there would not have been a problem if you hadn\u2019t touched the period pad pack. Ex SIL doesn\u2019t have much money and menstrual products are getting more and more expensive. You broke a house rule, of your own free will.", "YTA, but only for not buying another box to replace the one you opened. I'm sure that even his ex must understand that emergencies happen. This is one of those cases where the cover-up is worse than the crime.", "YTA\n\n\nHe just told you not to touch anything of hers....and you did. Why didn't you just tell him you started period and ask if you could take a pad??  You or him could have gone to the store after and just bought a new pack for her to replace the one you opened.\n\nInstead you didn't say anything and he found out. He's probably more upset about you lying/omitting the truth than the pad itself.", "NTA. Obviously pads are different than other products as they would be for her, but what if you had taken some Tylenol or used her brand of toilet paper. I would take pads as something more like that and not as much falling under his don\u2019t touch her things statement", "Did they count how many squares of toilet paper you used too? One pad for a guest in a home is just like using toilet paper in my opinion.", "YTA. I always carry extra pads and tampons, no matter when my period's suppose to be. You did what you had to do in that moment, but you created the situation by not being prepared when you easily could've been.\n\nYou can't really be surprised that he's mad that you opened a new bag of her pads when he specifically told you not to touch any of her stuff. If you really want to make it right, buy her a new package.", "YTA you touched something in his house he explicitly told you not to. Nuff said.", ">He told me his ex-wife was coming to get everything and she \u201cneeded every period pad\u201d because she didn't have much money.\n\n>I feel like that wasn't my problem but maybe I could have handled it better.\n\nI\u2019m confused how you feel like it\u2019s \u201cnot your problem\u201d since you literally took one of her pads.  If she\u2019s that poor that a pad will cause a financial issue, then you need to replace the pad you used.  Your attitude is rather rude, honestly.\n\nMost people won\u2019t notice the loss of a pad.  She apparently will.  Buy another pack and give her one out of it (or if you want to be kind, you can give her the whole thing).  But if you don\u2019t offer to replace the pad you took, YTA.", "YTA not for taking the pad for your Attitude there\u2019s obviously shit happening with the divorce and it\u2019s causing drama just replace the pack", "NTA: Divorce is a very stressful shitty situation and reason is usually out the window.

OP has acknowledged they should have had a spare, but that their period happened outside of its cycle (something in her experience it never does).\n\nSo perhaps, we could give OP some grace, given that getting a unexpected period when you're away from home isn't a lovely experience.

Had it been a disant relative or someone she barely knows, it would have been different. But again had it been a person less close, it would probably have been even less appropriate to take a pad without asking"]}
