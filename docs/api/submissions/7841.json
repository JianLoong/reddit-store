But you also don\u2019t have to be rude and call me spoiled.", "ye  i use to work security  in the UK. We had a female colleague who was  sharing a bed with a manager and she would verbally tell us what to do but nothing in writing and we would have to suck it up or get  pulled up for a word with this manager(she was not a boss and had less experience than most of her colleagues). Clever of her and one of the reasons i got out of the security gig industry. No job security and that sort of thing was common.  Unfortunately without corroborating evidence  i believe its hearsay. Clever of your former employer. Definitely seek legal advice but things into chronological order as suggested and go from there.", "I think I\u2019ll definitely speak with labor board..even if it just makes them look into the company and the supervisors ya know.

But I couldn\u2019t hear her correctly on that part because it was loud and I just reiterated \u201cma\u2019am I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience but due to policy, staffing, and the amount of customer we have we can\u2019t fulfill this order today..\u201d I have immense respect for veterans and individuals currently in the military. And I never gave any indication that I didn\u2019t. I just simply stated policy and apologized. I even offered to call other cafes to see if they can help her.", "I'm in Texas. Have you at least filed for unemployment? TWC is pretty decent at approving claims. Then if you want to sue, go for the company, no lawyer will do the customer. Call around employment lawyers who work on contingency and see if you have a case.", "Its also because its easy to get jobs in USA. In Europe you have to wait years for a permanent position and forget it if you are an African immigrant. You will be a contract worker forever.
