If you're in the U.S., please check out Section 8 housing in your county and SS disability payments.  He should probably also qualify for Medicare, which can be incredibly helpful despite its flaws.  (As I understand it, some Medicare Advantage plans do offer caregiver services but you'd need to check carefully.)  This isn't going to take care of all of your step-brother's needs, but should at least be helpful.  Also, the Center for Independent Living has counselors with a lot of knowledge about various programs that might be able to help.  In some states there are fully subsidized caregivers (not 24/7 as far as I know, but with substantial coverage).  A social worker who serves clients with physical challenges should be able to direct you.  Obviously, this isn't stuff you're under any obligation to pursue, I'm just trying to think of alternatives other than your guest room.", "If he receives Medicaid, Medicaid waiver services are for people who would otherwise need assisted living, which it sounds like he does."]}
