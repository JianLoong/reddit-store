He's not your problem.  Just keep in mind that shit happens.  Life is suffering.  Who's gonna take care of you if truck-kun hits you and you become paraplegic?", "NTA\n\nIt's been long enough that Stepbrother could have retrained for another job (phone customer service, for instance) by now.  And he could apply for government support.\n\nBut you aren't obligated to choose him as the recipient of your charity.", "NTA do not let him move in! If you feel really guilty agree to pay for a motel room for a month while he figures things out. In the long run it would be cheaper than having him leech off you for the rest of his life.", "Where is your dad?", "NTA", "NTA - He should have had some plans for the future (e.g. Now) after his stroke. He isn't your child, and you don't really consider him a brother. And he knew that.", "NTA the only humans your are responsible for are ones you made and have yet to reach 18", "If this is the US, step brother is going to be homeless unless he has somewhere else to go.", "That was a messed up joke, I\u2019m laughing but it was messed up.", "This is reality.

Accommodations and payments for people with disability are always overestimated by people who refuse or haven't looked into it but also are usually the same people who think they should get even less and tell them to rely on friends or family - until it's them in thay case they don't want 'the burden'.", "There\u2019s aid available, but it is difficult to qualify for it. And in many areas, the available aid is just short of providing for all a person\u2019s needs. But if they try to work even just a little, to cover the gap, they earn \u201ctoo much\u201d and lose all their aid.\n\nIt keeps people who could earn some money to heal support themselves out of the job market completely, because they can\u2019t afford to lose Medicaid/Medicare and the other benefits.\n\nAnd heaven forbid that with modern technology a disabled person tried to work a few hours from home each week, to cover some of their expenses. One dollar over an arbitrary \u201cpoverty limit\u201d and they lose all their benefits.\n\nIt is a totally messed up system.", "Social Security for *extra* income? Does a unicorn deliver it too?", "I have back issues I am on SSD. It took me over a month to try to set up in home assistance knowing that I had a surgery coming up and I would need much more help. They denied me. I appealed and had to go back through the 4 part assessment again. Another month. I am not in continuous medical need of service. I can't clean my floors or wash my laundry most days. My husband helps me shower. But I can reach my feet and I don't need help getting dressed. They suggested I apply with the county for someone to help clean my house. That service doesn't exist here. I asked, I begged for that service. So I had my surgery, and my 11 year old my 9 year old and my husband took care of me. Disability gives me 1000 a month. Alone I would not qualify for SNAP. Or only just a small amount. Again, alone I would barely qualify for section 8 housing. Rent here in the worst neighborhoods is at least 800 a month. I don't live in an expensive place either, but if I lived away from the bus lines I would not be able to go to the doctor or the grocery store. In short if I had to live alone on disability I would be left to die because I can still walk and touch my feet and dress myself. \n\nBut there's help out there for us...", ">Especially if this dude is in a Republican lead state\n\nnot even, really. In some Democratic cities, he's more likely to get more services and his path out of homelessness might be shorter/more realistic. But there's pretty close to zero chance he'd avoid homelessness altogether anywhere in the US unless he has a family/friend safety net. \n\nHis best hope to avoid actually sleeping on the street is if he's in a mid-sized liberal, cold weather city, where there are usually enough shelter beds to keep the homeless from freezing to death overnight.", "No, it wouldn\u2019t. Plenty of disabled homeless people out there.", "What percent of total income does the top 25% make?", "Social security disability/SSI is completely distinct from social security for retirement, and it is very real and for someone with a debilitating stroke it will not be hard to get.", "Most of them have mental health struggles.

Money for these things get congregated meaning some people are forced to move if they need more help.", "About 70% according to the IRS\u2026but as I stated previously they're only following the tax rules the Congress enacted\u2026and nobody is wrong for following the rules and paying the minimum tax they need to pay. My point that the top 25% pays 87% of the income tax paid shows that they're already paying more than their share\u2026but the real point is that they're the ones that are actually funding the government despite the constant demands from the left that the rich \"pay their fair share\"\u2026but it seems to me that if you earn 70% of the total income (actually the number was for adjusted gross income which is as close as the IRS site provided to total income) but pay 87% of the tax burden then you're already paying your fair share.", "Sure. *if he worked enough years paying into the system.* You\u2019re making a massive assumption that his manual labor jobs paid enough into the system. \n\nThe gaps are there on purpose because of conservatives. The cruelty is the point.\n\nAlso, you know how I know he didn\u2019t work enough years? Because no one rejects free money.", "Why would someone with nothing and no where to go develop struggles with their mental health? /s", "You think disability pays for housing and full time medical care? Lol.", "Yeah, that's not good. Expensive places need to keep with the times when it comes to their vulnerable citizens. Not that it's easy to get everything here; you have to jump through a lot of hoops, but once you do, you can at least live without too much worry.", "No assumptions needed, just a little background knowledge and/or research before arguing. You don\u2019t have to pay a cent into social security to get SSI, and there are millions of dollars in benefits than eligible people don\u2019t claim every year."]}
