A house is a solid investment and you weren\u2019t ever going to allow him to have that shared with you.

The mortgage didn't have to stay from your parents, there are whole companies that specialize in house financing that do refinances....", "I would buy my own house too if I was told I would never have a stake in it, no point throwing money in the garbage every month.", "Please change the locks!", "Oh damn. Yeah, you're not losing anything from him leaving!", "Be careful if you ever get married because in my state if a spouse has lived in the home for 10 years or more they are entitled to some of the equity. One of my friends gave up receiving alimony to avoid having to give her husband some of the equity in the house she bought when she was single", "This just perfectly explains the way I feel about my previous relationship in a way that makes more sense than I have ever been able to.", "She has been had. He was clearly hiding the bad points and showed his true colors at a later stage. Definitely not someone you wanna stay with.", "Bullshit, he was told he had no stake in the house and never would, why the hell wouldn't he buy his own property?", "He couldn't have gone out and bought his own property if he hadn't been freeloading off OP. If anything she should be on his deed.", "I will never not have a handheld shower head", "Not if her parents are not willing to sell it to them!", "You are obviously the boyfriend, go take a shower", "He paid no rent or utilities. That has nothing to do with having a stake in the house it has to do with paying for what you use.", "Good, she didn't deserve alimony for the honor of being a woman.", "Because not only did he contribute zero capital, he wasn't even holding up his end of the living arrangement. He deserved nothing. While he was sponging off OP, he paid down his debt and acquired property. Is OP going to be put on the deed of that? No mention.", "It\u2019s him. This is the boyfriend.", "kind of makes me wish I was a woman, because for me, a shower head can't also count as a sex toy.", "Me either the turbo jets make a good bung scrubber \ud83d\ude01", "They already have a mortgage, the deed is already in her name all she needed to do was refinance through someone that isn't her parents. Jesus.", "lol, so many people making the same asinine joke. And people say reddit isn't a hivemind. People thinking they are clever really get me off. Do I owe you cab fare?", "And he went out and found his own property, good for him. No point throwing money in the garbage can there.", "Of course he contributed zero, he had no stake in it. Thus the \"buy in\".... What do you think buy in means?", "lol, it's makes me laugh when people think they're clever.", "That\u2019s a lack of imagination talking.", "\u201cMy parents are the mortgage of my home\u201d is what she says. I assume they they hold the mortgage for her?  Her grandparents built the home.", "Take the L", "Must be nice to live totally cost free so you can save up a down payment.", "RENT. He agreed to RENT  and paid nothing.", "You pay for RENT. It\u2019s only manners to contribute SOMETHING when you move in to NOT-YOUR-HOUSE", "I heard no offer of him sinking cash into anything. What does buy in mean to you?", "he was living in it.  that's a pretty significant stake.", "You good?", "really now. I am pretty vanilla so maybe you\u2019re right about this. Gonna need to find ideas, but seeing as I don't have much in the way of experience even at my tender age of 24, I'm gonna have to find things  out here, at the least it would provide me some interesting times. Thanks for that.", "We don\u2019t know if they have signed the deed over  if they hold the mortgage.", "No it reads as she pays them the mortgage payment rather than a financial institution.", "Why would I take a leg, I already have three.", "Meh, they should have discussed the future before moving in. Expecting someone to pay rent and help maintain your house while being together with no stake in it is a bullshit position for OP to put him in.  Then try to say she wanted him in the deed but it's her parents that said no. She can't even own her own shit about not wanting him on the deed.", "That's a shitty dynamic. Each person should have a stake or the person without the stake should be able to save money so the living situation is equitable to both parties , or just live separately.", "No shit you didn't hear the offer, which I'm sure OP left vague  on purpose. She can't even own up to her self that she is the one that doesn't want him on the house, instead she uses her parents as a scapegoat.", "That's not a pretty significant stake, how asinine. I guess all the renters need to stop complaining they can't buy houses, they already have a significant stake in it!!!!!!", "Fantastic", "Moving into a house and expecting to live there rent free after agreeing to rent is a bullshit position for any reasonable human being to take.", "renters pay rent to live in a home they don't own.", "No stake in a shared property after 4 years is also pretty bullshit. I'm glad he got his own property.", "And it's a pretty shitty relationship dynamic for one to be the landlord. She clearly didn't want a future with him either and is trying to alleviate any of her own guilt through excuses. Blaming it on her parents, because he was totes the one."]}
