I've vocalize how I don't want to go to my dad many times but each time it turns into him yelling at me about how I need to read my Bible and how I need this and brings up \"mistakes\" I've made. Or he'll go off on a rant about how I'm selfish and ungrateful because I don't want to do this one thing but want him to do things for me even tho he \"legally\" doesn't have to.

And I mean yea he doesn't have to do that he could of not had us or given us up but since he didn't, we'll then yes legally he has to feed us. I'm 20 so I've been trying to buy my own groceries and do my own thing but even then he goes off at me about how we're a family and I can't buy food for only myself. \n\nBut anyway this morning I made sure to try and take forever in the bathroom so he'd just leave me so I didn't have to go to church, he yelled at me and went on one of his rants and eventually I was dragged to church all while he called me ungrateful and selfish\n\nA few edits: I know I'm a legal adult, I know I could just go to the bank and do this and that. The thing is I can't, when I leave the house I have to ask permission and let my parents know where I'm going.\n\nI tried to get my license as soon as I turned 16, my dad wouldn't allow it, still doesn't I've been learning and trying to drive but everytime I try to schedule the test he shuts it down and says I'm not ready.

But right now you are dealing with the emotional effects of the abuse, so I beg you to reach out to the college counseling at school and explain the situation. They may have resources they can connect you to, and you'll at least have support other than your boyfriend. You may be able to get connected to a buddy/peer counselor who can do things like go to the bank with you etc. There might be housing financing or other programs you qualify for.

Could he ask them to help you out on his behalf?", "Okay. Also. Go to the bursar or whatever the correct office is at your college. Talk to them about this. It is possible you could do things the old-fashioned way and pick up a check at their office which you will then deposit in the new bank account you're going to make at a bank he doesn't know about.\n\nAlso talk to your school's housing office, see if they have any options for you.", " It's illegal for him to take your college money.

Particularly things related to finances.   Because if your father is taking your college financial aide, I'm suspecting that your mail is delivered to his house, and he takes it and reads it without your permission, deposits the checks into a shared account then transfers money from the account you share with him to his private account whenever he wants. There might also be PO boxes you can rent on your college campus, which would be convenient for getting your mail discreetly.  \n\nAlso, where is your mother in this picture?  Do you have any trusted aunts or uncles who might help you, perhaps with a temporary place to stay once you have control of your pay, so you can save up for an apartment deposit?", "That's something the college can help with.

I think in your case I would take out students loans and use them to rent a room somewhere. Your mental health is important. I know in this day and age folks just can't move out like they used to with cost of living being so high.

I don't believe normally into going into unnecessary debt but you need to get away from your dad. He isn't necessarily a bad person but he is used to controlling and browbeating and manipulating the masses. And you have a strong independent mind. He just wants the performance of you attending his church not that you are religious. Visit the financial aid office at your school and see what is available to you. Until then maybe say you want to spend Sunday in Bible study and contemplation at home. He shouldn't have a problem with that. Maybe get a second job where you can work on Sundays.

What your father has been doing has a name. It's financial abuse.\n\nA lot of people won't recognize it, because he's not (as far as you've said) running up bills in your name or destroying your credit, but his actions *do* still fall under the categories of \"Economic Exploitation\" (wherein you have no access to your money, or to the majority of it) and \"Coerced Debt\" (wherein he deliberately forces you to remain financially dependent on him).\n\nPeople who practice this type of abuse deliberately brainwash their victims into believing they cannot get out of the situation.\n\nThis isn't true. You can get out of it. But it is going to be very hard. And first you have to accept that you will have to do some things which *seem* like they will put you in a worse situation. But they will help in the long run.\n\nAnd you have to understand that you can't help your siblings if you can't help yourself. You can't pull them out of the water while you're drowning.\n\nYou need to do a lot, so I'll give you a bit of a checklist:\n\nGet any documentation you have. If you have to get it from your father, say someone in an office at your college asked for it or something but get all your documents you're able to get. This includes identity documents and banking paperwork, as well as any school records you can access. DON'T worry if you can't get them all. It will make things harder, but you CAN get out, even if you have none of them.\n\nTake those, and a few clothes/personal items, and contact a domestic violence or emergency shelter line. Get out of the house before taking any other steps.\n\nStay at the center you find on the call, or with friends while you contact your bursar's office. Tell them that your father has been taking your college funds. This is illegal. They will help you file a report with the school and one with the police department. In some cases, they may replace the funds you didn't receive, but at the least, no further funds will go to your father.\n\nPeople for the domestic violence line can help you get what evidence you need for the bank, to get your money out/get your father off of your accounts/etc. \n\nDon't be afraid to explain the situation. People are going to want to help you. \n\nOnce you've done this, speak with the counseling office at your college, and let them know what's happened and where you are staying. Ask for help finding on/off campus housing within your budget.\n\nDo NOT accept any calls or invitations from your parents. I'm not saying you have to go no contact as a permanent decision, but you will need to do so until you are stable. This is because he will try to gaslight you and make you believe you're doing something wrong.\n\nYou are not doing anything wrong. Your father is breaking the laws, and preventing an adult from getting an education and any form of financial security. Is this how a father acts? Read the story of the prodigal son. Even if you were making mistakes, wouldn't a good father let you make your own mistakes? Remind yourself of this when he tries to contact you, or when you start to doubt yourself.\n\nIf you need to, it's also okay to contact united way, who have a list of resources to help in your area. They might have a way to help with food and utilities and even rent while you are transitioning!", "You\u2019re 20 years old, not 12. Go to the bank and figure it all out. Take responsibility for your finances and your future.", "You need to open a new bank account with a completely different bank, and have all your paychecks direct deposit to the new bank, and same with the money from college. \nAlso, go to your current bank with your ID, and get bank statements so you know what's in there.

If it's not, then have them reset passwords etc, so he can't access it anymore", "go to the bank and tell them all this. they can help you and maybe even reclaim your money.", "As long as your name is on the account and you have an ID, you can do your banking at the bank without need of passwords. Shoot, you could change the passwords yourself. But you're likely better off making new accounts and, possibly, depending on your safety, transferring money from the old accounts.\n\nTell them, also, that your father is likely to try to access your account against your wishes and see if there's any extra security precautions they can take in case he calls pretending to be you or whatever.", "Your father is financially exploiting you. Open up your own bank account, before you move out.

You are in a rough spot here OP and need out ASAP.\n\nI know it seems like you are trapped, but the trick is going to be working around the blocks. It will be hard and take time to get it all set up. \n\nFirst we need to get you a new email. Incognito mode will be your best friend here. Even better if you use a device he doesn't have access to. Maybe the local library computer or even a coworkers phone.\n\nSecond. We need a way to hide any new mail you get. A PO box would be best.  Since you work, your coworkers or even a manager may be able to help you. (I would say speak to your fellow students, but your dad strikes me as the kind of asshole to have you do online schooling to keep you isolated) You have to do some recon to see who doesn't think the sun shines out your families ass. I would recommend finding an atheist. They will be your best bet. Once you do give them a lowdown. Tell them you need help getting out. See if they would be willing to get a PO box you can use as new spot for your mail. Assure them you will pay them back once you are out. Also ask if you can store things at their home to keep safe. The idea here is to use their home address to sidestep your family. Maybe even let you stay for a couple days on your big escape if you need too.\n\nOnce you have the PO box now you can get a new bank account set up. Chime is online and only needs an email, social security number, ID and residential address. You don't have to have the mail sent there. You can use the PO as the shipping address for all your mail. The idea is to create an account your father doesn't know about. Once it's set up you can now start the escape. Request a replacement copy of social security card. You can do this online. I believe you can do the same with your birth certificate. Store those with the trusted coworker or even at work if you can. Have it all sent to the PO box. (If your work offers you a locker for your personal stuff that is).\n\nIf you can't stay with a coworker, get a list of womens shelters if you can. I know you said the homeless shelters are bad, but keep them in mind. If nothing else you can use them a last resort. You may need a fallback spot if it's gets bad. You could also check to see if anyone is looking for a roommate. Your might have to explain your situation,but it could help temporarly until you get the leech cut off. \n\nNow the hardest part is going to be cutting him from your money. You may have to do it in all one or two days if possible. Tell your supervisor you need to change your direct deposit info immediately due to theft. I would do this at the beginning of a pay period. It will give you time set up your final escape before he notices . Go to your financial aid office. Either borrow money from a coworker for the bus or see if one of them can give you a ride. You make have to call in sick to work to free up the time. Let them know about the theft of your grant money by your father. Tell them that you need to have the checks mailed to the new PO box or set up for direct deposit. See what options they might have to recoup the money he has already stolen.\n\nOnce this is all set up and you get your money at your new account, just leave. Factory reset your phone (if you have one) to disable any trackers. Take your laptop (again if you have one).  I would say go to the banks you're using now, but I'm guessing the accounts are are in his name and you're just an authorized user. You may have to take that money already in there as a loss. \n\nThis is going to take time. Maybe even months or even a year. At lot of it is going to be keeping your head down and pretending to go along with the program. Let him think he has broken you. But inside your mind that's what he can't control. \n\nYou could even do some of this and wait till your boyfriend gets back so that you can cut daddy dearest all out at once. But honestly I wouldn't wait that long. Too easy for things to go bad. Your BF may have his deployment extended, you may lose your jobs due to your fathers sabotage, or since he strikes me as this type have you get married to someone in the church before your BF gets back so you can't get away. \n\nThis isn't a perfect escape plan and honestly I can only guess based on what you've told us here. But I hope at the least it can give some ideas and inspiration on where to start.  Best of luck OP.", "Call the police this is abuse CPS as well", "NTA but you need to take action.\n\n1. Next time you are at college, go to the bursars office and tell them your father is taking your grant money and not letting you have access to it. Tell them he refuses to let you get your drivers license or have bus fare unless he approves the trip so you are trapped at home. Tell them you are terrified of your mother and need to escape the house. Ask them to help you about the money and refer you to a counselor for the domestic abuse.\n\n2. Time to reach out to your boyfriend and see if his family can come and take you away and give you a place until you get one your feet. You are of age and no one can stop you.\n\n3. In the meantime, act as compliant as you can re going to church etc. so the situation does not escalate further.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA- you father sounds like everything a good Christian isn\u2019t.  You need to get help to get out of your abusive situation.", "*Abused. OP is being abused.", "OP is abused. Grow a heart.", "OP is being abused. There is no \u201cgrowing a pair\u201d and \u201cgetting a flat.\u201d OP *can\u2019t* at the moment.", "Your dad is financially abusing you. That money is yours not his.", "Report this ASAP", "The next time you get paid, go straight to a bank different from the one your father uses and open an account. Then always deposit your check into your account before you go home. Same thing with your college money.\n\nYou have to get out. And nothing is going to change unless you MAKE it change. I feel for you.", "ok stop him doing that, do it today.\n\nyou need to open an account that he has no access to.\n\nand if you have no transportation to go to a bank, and it's a 3 hour walk away, then you need to walk for 3 hours and go do it.", "Open an account online with a bank and get your checks deposited there. Your father shouldn't have access to that money", "File a police report what he is doing is stealing", "If you're in the US, there are multiple online banks that you can open accounts with without being in person.", "Call. The. Police. Please. Say you are being held against your will and abused, because you are. Tell your coworkers. Tell your professors. TELL EVERYONE. I understand that's hard and scary. But you have to. Unless your boyfriend is coming back in a matter of months. We're just all afraid your father will escalate or try to move or something. You're nowhere near the asshole, but you desperately need help. You're not alone, I promise you.", "This right here\nAnd with how to get out from what I heard from an other Redditer is leave when they are not home let the cops know you are an adult trying to leave a bad family situation because if your parents do try to report you as missing", "Open a new account. Put your money there and do not ever give him access.", "So maybe the money he\u2019s already stolen from you is out of your reach, but from this minute onward, you can have control as long as you take it. The next time you are paid, go to a different bank and open an account in your name only. Then either get your employer to do direct deposit with your checks, or if you receive a physical check from them, just always stop at your new bank on the way home and deposit your money. \n\nYou\u2019re going to have to take action to make things change. I\u2019m sorry you have such an overbearing and financially abusive father, but\u2026you are 20. It is high time for you to take control of your life.", "I\u2019d like to add that they should get to the bank, open a new account, get a debit card for that account, and have you paychecks directly deposited in that account"]}
