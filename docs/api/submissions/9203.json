Or he'll go off on a rant about how I'm selfish and ungrateful because I don't want to do this one thing but want him to do things for me even tho he \"legally\" doesn't have to.

And I mean yea he doesn't have to do that he could of not had us or given us up but since he didn't, we'll then yes legally he has to feed us. I'm 20 so I've been trying to buy my own groceries and do my own thing but even then he goes off at me about how we're a family and I can't buy food for only myself. \n\nBut anyway this morning I made sure to try and take forever in the bathroom so he'd just leave me so I didn't have to go to church, he yelled at me and went on one of his rants and eventually I was dragged to church all while he called me ungrateful and selfish\n\nA few edits: I know I'm a legal adult, I know I could just go to the bank and do this and that. The thing is I can't, when I leave the house I have to ask permission and let my parents know where I'm going.\n\nI tried to get my license as soon as I turned 16, my dad wouldn't allow it, still doesn't I've been learning and trying to drive but everytime I try to schedule the test he shuts it down and says I'm not ready.

But right now you are dealing with the emotional effects of the abuse, so I beg you to reach out to the college counseling at school and explain the situation. They may have resources they can connect you to, and you'll at least have support other than your boyfriend. You may be able to get connected to a buddy/peer counselor who can do things like go to the bank with you etc. There might be housing financing or other programs you qualify for.

Could he ask them to help you out on his behalf?", "Okay. Also. Go to the bursar or whatever the correct office is at your college. Talk to them about this. It is possible you could do things the old-fashioned way and pick up a check at their office which you will then deposit in the new bank account you're going to make at a bank he doesn't know about.\n\nAlso talk to your school's housing office, see if they have any options for you.", " It's illegal for him to take your college money.

Particularly things related to finances.   Because if your father is taking your college financial aide, I'm suspecting that your mail is delivered to his house, and he takes it and reads it without your permission, deposits the checks into a shared account then transfers money from the account you share with him to his private account whenever he wants. There might also be PO boxes you can rent on your college campus, which would be convenient for getting your mail discreetly.  \n\nAlso, where is your mother in this picture?  Do you have any trusted aunts or uncles who might help you, perhaps with a temporary place to stay once you have control of your pay, so you can save up for an apartment deposit?", "That's something the college can help with.

I think in your case I would take out students loans and use them to rent a room somewhere. Your mental health is important. I know in this day and age folks just can't move out like they used to with cost of living being so high.

I don't believe normally into going into unnecessary debt but you need to get away from your dad. He isn't necessarily a bad person but he is used to controlling and browbeating and manipulating the masses. And you have a strong independent mind. He just wants the performance of you attending his church not that you are religious. Visit the financial aid office at your school and see what is available to you. Until then maybe say you want to spend Sunday in Bible study and contemplation at home. He shouldn't have a problem with that. Maybe get a second job where you can work on Sundays.

What your father has been doing has a name. It's financial abuse.\n\nA lot of people won't recognize it, because he's not (as far as you've said) running up bills in your name or destroying your credit, but his actions *do* still fall under the categories of \"Economic Exploitation\" (wherein you have no access to your money, or to the majority of it) and \"Coerced Debt\" (wherein he deliberately forces you to remain financially dependent on him).\n\nPeople who practice this type of abuse deliberately brainwash their victims into believing they cannot get out of the situation.\n\nThis isn't true. You can get out of it. But it is going to be very hard. And first you have to accept that you will have to do some things which *seem* like they will put you in a worse situation. But they will help in the long run.\n\nAnd you have to understand that you can't help your siblings if you can't help yourself. You can't pull them out of the water while you're drowning.\n\nYou need to do a lot, so I'll give you a bit of a checklist:\n\nGet any documentation you have. If you have to get it from your father, say someone in an office at your college asked for it or something but get all your documents you're able to get. This includes identity documents and banking paperwork, as well as any school records you can access. DON'T worry if you can't get them all. It will make things harder, but you CAN get out, even if you have none of them.\n\nTake those, and a few clothes/personal items, and contact a domestic violence or emergency shelter line. Get out of the house before taking any other steps.\n\nStay at the center you find on the call, or with friends while you contact your bursar's office. Tell them that your father has been taking your college funds. This is illegal. They will help you file a report with the school and one with the police department. In some cases, they may replace the funds you didn't receive, but at the least, no further funds will go to your father.\n\nPeople for the domestic violence line can help you get what evidence you need for the bank, to get your money out/get your father off of your accounts/etc. \n\nDon't be afraid to explain the situation. People are going to want to help you. \n\nOnce you've done this, speak with the counseling office at your college, and let them know what's happened and where you are staying. Ask for help finding on/off campus housing within your budget.\n\nDo NOT accept any calls or invitations from your parents. I'm not saying you have to go no contact as a permanent decision, but you will need to do so until you are stable. This is because he will try to gaslight you and make you believe you're doing something wrong.\n\nYou are not doing anything wrong. Your father is breaking the laws, and preventing an adult from getting an education and any form of financial security. Is this how a father acts? Read the story of the prodigal son. Even if you were making mistakes, wouldn't a good father let you make your own mistakes? Remind yourself of this when he tries to contact you, or when you start to doubt yourself.\n\nIf you need to, it's also okay to contact united way, who have a list of resources to help in your area. They might have a way to help with food and utilities and even rent while you are transitioning!", "You\u2019re 20 years old, not 12. Go to the bank and figure it all out. Take responsibility for your finances and your future.", "You need to open a new bank account with a completely different bank, and have all your paychecks direct deposit to the new bank, and same with the money from college. \nAlso, go to your current bank with your ID, and get bank statements so you know what's in there.

If it's not, then have them reset passwords etc, so he can't access it anymore", "go to the bank and tell them all this. they can help you and maybe even reclaim your money.", "As long as your name is on the account and you have an ID, you can do your banking at the bank without need of passwords. Shoot, you could change the passwords yourself. But you're likely better off making new accounts and, possibly, depending on your safety, transferring money from the old accounts.\n\nTell them, also, that your father is likely to try to access your account against your wishes and see if there's any extra security precautions they can take in case he calls pretending to be you or whatever.", "Your father is financially exploiting you. Open up your own bank account, before you move out.

I don't know if you have a way to get it without your dad or mom seeing it, (would a hard copy be better that you can hide or a download but if they check your phone they might find the download?) but it helps explain the mind control techniques that they used to brainwash us growing up. \n\nIf you have a community college nearby, I would talk with a financial counselor there to see what you could do for a major that could increase your income so you can get out of this situation. Even a faster technical course to start out with. You could check your local unemployment office. Sometimes they are connected with training programs that could get you started. \n\nDo you have any nonreligious family that could make space for you so you could move in with them? \n\nIt's really hard to see others in this situation. There were some Facebook groups that I was in for people who had left my religious group. Those were really helpful early on to see that many struggled with the same things I did.\n\nEdit. I saw more comments. Talk with your college.

You'll have to disobey them if they tell you you're not allowed to get one, but it is just barely possible they might be up for it.\n\nEDIT: I saw some of your responses elsewhere and you should definitely not tell your parents about your job. You also need to open a new bank account AT A BANK YOUR PARENTS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT so you can start saving money.", "NTA. Forget about the church part for a moment. This is abuse. Look up financial abuse, that\u2019s what this is. And parentification abuse by making you raise younger siblings. As an adult, he cannot take your money like this, both paychecks and grant money, unless you let him. Talk to someone at college, they may be able to help. Get a new account at a bank or credit union. Maybe the college has an on site credit union. You need to learn to drive. I can\u2019t stress that enough. That\u2019s another abuse tool to control you. Get a PO Box near college, so you can get mail without his surveillance. They\u2019re cheap. Start squirreling cash into your account. Divert your pay into the new account. Ask around for roommates at school. At any rate, make a plan to get TF out of that house!", "Do you have a person who can help you? Sometimes having someone go to the bank with you and support you making those changes can be a huge help. A teacher maybe or trusted neighbor?", "You need to grow up and get out.

He has stolen money from your college and from you.  It is time for justice to be done.\n\nReport him.  I realize that this is frightening, but *you are old enough to lead soldiers into battle.*  You can *do this.*\n\nAnd take hold of your power as an adult.  You can go to your bank or credit union and inform them that you wish to establish an independent account and put your money into it--though I advise choosing a new-to-you financial institution instead so your father can't bamboozle a teller into letting him at your money on the grounds that surely it was supposed to be joint, look, he banks there too, blah blah blah.  You can have your paychecks directly deposited into your new account.  \n\nYou can endure the stomachaches, racing heart, sweating palms, and mental spiraling of going against his will.

I wish he'd just kick me out but he would never do that. The last time I actually tried to be rebellious and do me I was punished, I couldn't leave the house for a month, at the time I had a full time job. No phone, no TV, no communication, nothing that I would enjoy like my hobbies. I ended up losing my job and was unemployed for months having to ask him for every penny.

Everyone in my neighborhood looks up to my dad, I like in a rougher neighborhood so even the drug dealers know him so if I were to ever even try to hypothetically buy anything from them they'd tell me no, that's how much everyone looks up to my family", "As you're at college, I would see what kind of advisors and health staff they can provide. They may be able to set you up with accommodation with other students. Not sure what services US colleges have, but you may be able to be signposted to mental health staff, financial advisors and maybe other help. I know my uni was able to do hardship loans/grants for people in tight spots. \n\nI'd say look at what the college has first, as anything they provide will generally be tailored to students, but if they don't offer a lot you may need to look elsewhere. If you have a tutor, it might be wise to give them a headsup if shit's going to go down, so they can help if you need extended deadlines.", "That's not legal.\nGo to a college counselor and tell them what's going on.\n\nYou have to be an advocate for yourself or what nothing will change.\n\nGood luck.", "Wait HOLD UP.

At some point you have to decide that you are worth it.  You deserve safety and autonomy as much as your younger siblings that you want to protect.\n\nGet your accounts sorted out.  Get your independence. Your parents will either get better or worse in response, but you have to set boundaries unless you're okay with being treated this way eternally.
