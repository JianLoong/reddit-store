I didn't say anything, just showed up (I lived out of province) and I made a point to not smile enough to show teeth but tried to make my eyes smile. pictures turned out perfect, I ended up saving the dance part because the groomsmen who were supposed to move the tables decided to leave to drink elsewhere. So there's me and my ugly smile in a floor-length dress moving 100 tables and god knows how many chairs by my lonesome. \n\nDid I have fun at the wedding, no.\n\nDid I like the Groom, no\n\nWould I do it for my friend again, in a heartbeat.\n\nPS - she (Bride) also said she didn't even notice I didn't get the stuff done.
