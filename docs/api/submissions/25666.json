And why wasn\u2019t this an issue before marriage? \n\nYour wife will always have a different type of relationship with her own daughter as opposed to your own. But your wife did marry someone with a kid. However your daughter doesn\u2019t have to be included in everything she does with her own daughter.\n\nYou all could sit down and have an adult conversation about this without having to snap at one another.", "ESH. \n\nDo you do things with both of them? Because if not, then you\u2019re a complete hypocrite. \n\nYes, your wife should make more of an effort. But that doesn\u2019t actually mean she needs to invite SD on these specific outings. \n\nWhat you\u2019re failing to recognize is that it\u2019s okay for your wife to want that time with her daughter.", "Nobody is the asshole really, it\u2019s all miscommunications. It\u2019s obviously that your daughter is not the same to her as her own daughter. You talked to your daughter about this, she said she wants to go, you know she\u2019s shy and won\u2019t ask herself, your wife cannot read her mind, you could\u2019ve just told your wife that your daughter wants to be more included. Step children is always hard, you cannot replace their parents and it\u2019s sometimes hard, especially with teenagers, to find a balance between forcing yourself on them even though they didn\u2019t ask for a stepparent or excluding them. Maybe your wife was scared to be to insisting. \n\nIn the specific situation you asked if your daughter could come you knew your SD had a bad day and just wanted mother daughter time, that should be respected. Idk what these girls days mean to your wife and SD, maybe they really mean a lot as they go out as mom and daughter, that way maybe that moment isn\u2019t the right one for your daughter to string along. In that case you could raise the idea of planning something the 3 women can do together on a different day\n\nAll of this is just caused by lack of communication", "ESH.  It may be the case that, as SD doesn't get her mother all the time and your daughter lives with you both full-time, she would feel left out if she had to share her mother on their days out.  So the problem is that your wife will not develop a relationship with her when it's just them.\n\nYou also don't mention you spending time with your SD?  Or you, wife and daughter doing things together?", "NTA. Your wife saying that your daughter just needs to ask is a deflection, and a shitty one. She knows what she is doing and she doesn\u2019t care.", "ESH\nFirstly you've gotten married to a woman who doesn't get along with your shy daughter and doesn't appear to be making an effort to bridge that gap.\nSoon as she married you she has two daughters but she's not taking the one that isn't biologically hers on girls days or thought that she might like to be included.\nShe may be a wonderful person but she hasn't clicked with the most important person in your life- massive red flag. \nSo for that reason you are an asshole.\n\nHowever, calling her out on that and trying to get her to integrate your daughter is a positive step, but throws you into conflict with another important person, your new daughter who wanted time with her mum.\n\nThese family dynamics should have been sorted long before the wedding bells rang.\n\nHope you can all get along in the future but you've got a rough few months ahead of you OP.", "How often do you take both daughters out somewhere?", "Hmmm I think you did great standing up for your daughter but snapping was not needed, it could have been a simple calm discussion brought up at a time that wasn't when her own daughter is having a bad mental health day and just only wants her mom around. I feel you were a but of an asshole in trying to force her daughter to hang out with yours on a bad day sometimes we just want to be alone and only have the person we feel safe with around. And that's okay. There is plenty more times and more appropriate I'd say, for your daughter to come tag along with them.", "NTA.  It can't be on a shy teen to establish the relationship with a stepparent.  Your wife has to initiate that.", "INFO: are your daughter and her daughter friends?", "This is difficult. But I\u2019m going to say NAH. I understand you advocating for your daughter. But marrying your wife does not mean that she is now your daughter\u2019s mother. The fiction that step parents are real parents has caused no end of trouble. It can be a very positive relationship, but you\u2019re crazy if you think she will ever have anybody truly be equal to her own daughter and ask that if her. \n\nThere is nothing dirty about her having her own thing with her own daughter.", "NTA, but I think this is something you should've looked into before marrying this woman. Your daughter deserves better.", "NTA. Your wife is the adult here. She can't know if your daughter wants to go or not without bothering to invite her. The bottom line is she doesn't want a relationship with yourcdaughter or she'd make an effort", "OP I was a shy teenager and lots of people interpreted this as me being stuck up, which meant they treated me badly and my anxiety got worse, I would make sure your wife knows that she has to put forth EFFORT in this new relationship especially because your daughter is withdrawn \n\nAll that said NTA \n\nGood dad", "Seems to me OP needs to suggest to his wife that she spends separate time with his daughter, rather than forcing both girls to spend time together.\n\nIt isn't fair on OP's wife's daughter to suddenly share all her 'mom time' with her stepsister. They're 15 which is old enough to decide if they want a close relationship. OPs wife is right to protect this time with her daughter, especially as it sounds like she only gets her 50% of the time as is. \n\nBut OP's wife does need to spend time with her stepdaughter. This may likely be an issue of communication though, as I imagine becoming the Stepmom of a 15 your old girl is pretty hard to navigate. She may be trying to respect stepdaughters boundaries and not pressure her, rather than actively be trying to exclude her. She may just need to be told it's fine to offer to spend time with stepdaughter rather than wait to be asked.", "We do spend time during breaks like thanksgiving break, winter break, spring break, and summer. We also spend time on birthdays.\nSD doesn\u2019t want a relationship with me", "Not friends but they talk occasionally"]}
