It\u2019s obviously that your daughter is not the same to her as her own daughter. You talked to your daughter about this, she said she wants to go, you know she\u2019s shy and won\u2019t ask herself, your wife cannot read her mind, you could\u2019ve just told your wife that your daughter wants to be more included. Step children is always hard, you cannot replace their parents and it\u2019s sometimes hard, especially with teenagers, to find a balance between forcing yourself on them even though they didn\u2019t ask for a stepparent or excluding them. Maybe your wife was scared to be to insisting. \n\nIn the specific situation you asked if your daughter could come you knew your SD had a bad day and just wanted mother daughter time, that should be respected. Idk what these girls days mean to your wife and SD, maybe they really mean a lot as they go out as mom and daughter, that way maybe that moment isn\u2019t the right one for your daughter to string along. In that case you could raise the idea of planning something the 3 women can do together on a different day\n\nAll of this is just caused by lack of communication", "ESH.  It may be the case that, as SD doesn't get her mother all the time and your daughter lives with you both full-time, she would feel left out if she had to share her mother on their days out.  So the problem is that your wife will not develop a relationship with her when it's just them.\n\nYou also don't mention you spending time with your SD?  Or you, wife and daughter doing things together?", "NTA. Your wife saying that your daughter just needs to ask is a deflection, and a shitty one.

I feel you were a but of an asshole in trying to force her daughter to hang out with yours on a bad day sometimes we just want to be alone and only have the person we feel safe with around. And that's okay. There is plenty more times and more appropriate I'd say, for your daughter to come tag along with them.", "NTA.  It can't be on a shy teen to establish the relationship with a stepparent.  Your wife has to initiate that.", "INFO: are your daughter and her daughter friends?", "This is difficult. But I\u2019m going to say NAH. I understand you advocating for your daughter. But marrying your wife does not mean that she is now your daughter\u2019s mother. The fiction that step parents are real parents has caused no end of trouble. It can be a very positive relationship, but you\u2019re crazy if you think she will ever have anybody truly be equal to her own daughter and ask that if her. \n\nThere is nothing dirty about her having her own thing with her own daughter.", "NTA, but I think this is something you should've looked into before marrying this woman. Your daughter deserves better.", "NTA. Your wife is the adult here. She can't know if your daughter wants to go or not without bothering to invite her. The bottom line is she doesn't want a relationship with yourcdaughter or she'd make an effort", "OP I was a shy teenager and lots of people interpreted this as me being stuck up, which meant they treated me badly and my anxiety got worse, I would make sure your wife knows that she has to put forth EFFORT in this new relationship especially because your daughter is withdrawn \n\nAll that said NTA \n\nGood dad", "Seems to me OP needs to suggest to his wife that she spends separate time with his daughter, rather than forcing both girls to spend time together.\n\nIt isn't fair on OP's wife's daughter to suddenly share all her 'mom time' with her stepsister. They're 15 which is old enough to decide if they want a close relationship. OPs wife is right to protect this time with her daughter, especially as it sounds like she only gets her 50% of the time as is. \n\nBut OP's wife does need to spend time with her stepdaughter. This may likely be an issue of communication though, as I imagine becoming the Stepmom of a 15 your old girl is pretty hard to navigate. She may be trying to respect stepdaughters boundaries and not pressure her, rather than actively be trying to exclude her. She may just need to be told it's fine to offer to spend time with stepdaughter rather than wait to be asked.", "We do spend time during breaks like thanksgiving break, winter break, spring break, and summer.

Without even speaking to your wife first or asking her how she thought her daughter would take it?\n\nSo what if your daughter wants to go if her stepsister doesn't want her there on a specific occasion or in general?\n\nNo real reason for acting like your stepdaughter should lose any individual time with her mother OR like she is required to be friends with your daughter. Girls day means with her friends. Why would your daughter automatically go? Did you think a girl's day is generally all girls in the world?\n\nNow, you could speak to your wife about generally working on a relationship with her stepdaughter and the two of them doing things together - but she's still very much allowed times that are just her and her daughter.\n\nYou really decided the day for this shit was a specific day your SD wanted just her mom?", "She wont know if your daughter wants to go unless she says it. Why does she not ask her if she wants to go. Are you sure you married an adult. If yes i would get an annullment since you have not been married long and chalk this up to a mistake", "NTA and good for you for standing you for your daughter! She'll always remember you stood up for her. Keep on your wife to include your daughter!", "Your wife is acting like your daughter doesn\u2019t matter to her and that\u2019s hurtful. She needs to understand she\u2019s blowing it. She should be welcoming a relationship.  It\u2019s an opportunity to have two daughters.", "NTA.  That she is never invited indicates that her presence isn\u2019t wanted. I can\u2019t believe an adult woman with a daughter the same age doesn\u2019t understand how shitty she is being to your daughter.", "ESH. Your daughter needs to speak up and say she is interested in stuff like that. Your wife needs to ask her. However, your daughter doesn't need to go every time. They can still have private time sometimes. Same with your daughter and your wife. Maybe suggest on weeks you don't have SD that your wife and daughter do something together to bond.", "In a polite world, you don't insert  yourself into other people's activities without an invitation.

How you treat each others children after moving in together should have been discussed before marriage.", "ESH, you (or your sister) need to make a special day for your daughter.

If your wife does not want to be close to your daughter, she won't be.  However, you as Dad can do the same for your daughter as wife and SD do. Dedicate time and resources for just you and your daughter.  Make it a regularly scheduled thing.  Wife nor SD is invited.  Find things your daughter would like to do.  As she gets a little older, it will be up to your daughter to find her own friends.  Support her being involved with extra curricular activities that help that.", "ESH because you are her parent and you married this awful woman who is being rude to your child.

It's really social anxiety. I didn't learn this until I was in my 30s and got on meds. I am doing so much better now, I can actually work and be okay around coworkers. You really should get your daughter a therapist and talk to her doctor about it.", "Your daughter is shy and your wife is not a mind reader. She could be interpreting that silence as that your daughter needs space. I'm being generous with that assumption. Wife deserves to have time with just her daughter but it is an AH move to always exclude your daughter if they do a fun outing. Needs to be better communication all around. ESH.", "NTA\n\nI haven't read any other replies before responding myself. Your wife SUCKS! Time for a serious think about your daughters life. I'd say to choose your daughter and cut the wife loose. She obviously doesn't have one fu\\*\\* to give about your daughter.\n\nIn my opinion, it the responsibility of all adults in the household to make sure that the children of the household are comfortable and happy. That happiness doesn't discriminate based on biology.", "I honestly believe you could\u2019ve went about this differently, \n\n1. I think your daughter needs to learn how to speak. Yes you did a good job advocating for her but this is a real ass world where closed mouths do not get fed, and that should\u2019ve been taught at this age already, you can\u2019t expect anything out of anyone without talking to them about it, it\u2019s just not how the world works. \n\nYour daughter cannot continue believing everything will be handed/coming to her without her trying in anyway. \n\nThis should\u2019ve been a conversation had a long time ago and now it\u2019s amounted to this, a mother and a daughter have a special bond and if they have their own \u201cthing/tradition\u201d I don\u2019t believe it should be expected they change their ways especially for a daughter she did not have. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you cannot do special things for/with her like she does for her child.. do you know how your wife\u2019s daughter felt when you tried to steal away her special moments with her mom to share with someone that doesn\u2019t speak to her? What if your wife and SD feel like your daughter doesn\u2019t take an interest in them because she\u2019s shy? Do you know everyone doesn\u2019t perceive the way people are as what they really are sometimes? shy can come off as stand off ish.\n\nIf your wife has done things with her in the past did you ask how they went? Did your daughter not talk the entire time and was being awkward or did she genuinely feel like she way enjoying herself? This also comes into play\u2026 the relationship between the daughters matters as well.. \n\nAll I will say is if you want your daughter to do things with them then simply plan it, give your wife money to take them both to a nail salon so they can all get their nails done, or take them shopping, or let them go out.. but do not force anyone into any relationship or it will be a resentful one", "NTA for what you asked however YTA for marrying someone who refuses to put an effort in with your daughter. You need to rethink your marriage and when your wife takes her daughter out YOU need to plan for something just for you & your daughter to do alone, without your wife & stepdaughter. I suggest Taylor Swift tickets just for the two of you.", "Your wife and stepdaughter have a very different relationship to what your wife is ever going to have with your daughter because they\u2019re mother and daughter.  It would be great if she would step up and include your daughter but I think forcing the issue is just going to cause problems.  Remember it\u2019s not just about your wife, you\u2019re now trying to force a friendship between two girls who may not really be friends.  \n\nNTA", "Y kinda TA. Your daughter should go when others do or when planned with wife and SD. This particular outing was to console SD, and was between her and her mother, it was not necessarily a fun free for all.

What time are you spending with your daughter and stepdaughter encouraging them to find common ground?\n\nESH - because while I completely agree that it is very rude that your wife and stepdaughter make plans they exclude your daughter in front of her, she\u2019s absolutely going to need to speak up for herself more.\n\nWe cannot silently will our way into relationships, as people cannot know what they do not know.\n\nThis seems like a communication failure all around.", "This sounds straightforward to me. Why don't you spend time with your daughter instead of asking your wife to? Maybe if you were to foster a closer relationship with your daughter she wouldn't feel so left out and consider it as a chance to improve your bond.  I think in this instance YTA for this. You place the onus on your wife when this is an opportunity for you to step up.", "Info: is it correct that your daughter live with you but SD doesn't?\nIf that's the case I think your wife is allowed to have some one on one time with her own daughter without always having to inclde your daughter.\nMaybe your wife and daughter can Do something fun on their own.", "YTA Why didn't you just wait till your daughter was out of high school to get married? You're a selfish person. I had to grow up with step families on with both parents, and I don't recommend remarriage until the children are out of high school. You can have a girlfriend and adult time without marriage. You probably wanted someone to cook and clean for you.  Now your daughter has to deal with a cold hearted stepmother and a father thinking of himself.", "NTA.  Exclusion is a form of bullying. Now do they have to include her every single time? No, but if they are pulling in Step Daughter\u2019s friends, they should absolutely include your daughter.  It\u2019s just unkind to exclude someone like that, especially if you are supposed to be a blended family.  Just doesn\u2019t seem like enough effort is made by your current wife as it relates to your daughter and that is really sad and wrong.  And if your daughter, who is shy is expressing that this makes her feel excluded, then it needs to be addressed.  Your wife is not acting like an adult.  But there are times when she should not have to include your daughter.  And maybe during those times, you plan a daughter dad time, movie, dinner, hike, take sailing lessons together, cooking classes, museum and lunch, so you daughter knows she is important to you.", "Your daughter should be included unless it's private sm/sd day.

The step-daughter doesn't need to be included with the bio-daughters friend group just because they're suddenly family. \n\nThat isn't deliberately excluding her step-daughter, it's one day every second week that the mom takes her daughter out and why should her daughter lose that?\n\nIf OP felt it would be good for them to spend more time together he could just bring it up and they could go on another day like the wife suggested or he could take both the daughters out himself. How often is he having days with his step-daughter? How often is he taking out his own daughter on his own? Why is just up to the wife to do these things?\n\nThese aren't kids we're talking about, they're 15 years old, they have their own lives and friend groups and relationships, it's not on anyone to force them spend time together, they'll be out the house in college in a few years.\n\nTelling him to end the marriage is laughable and shows a complete lack of social skills that you can only think in absolute extremes, made the wife out to be a calculated monster and will only suggest nuclear options to a situation that has every ability to be talked out.", "From these responses, how is your wife supposed to know that your daughter likes and wants to spend time with her if she\u2019s quiet during the outings?"]}
