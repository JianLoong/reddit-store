Been there for five years now.  \n\nI have a Japanese Akita. \n\nThese dogs shed a lot.  \n\nOne of my new coworkers is allergic to dogs. \n\nThis has caused an issue.  When they use the break room they start sneezing a lot.  I have pictures of my dog at my work station. So they know that I have him. It's not a secret or anything. \n\nThey went to the boss and said that they needed to be accommodated because of their medical condition.  He came to me and asked if I could please do anything.  So I started keeping a clean set of coveralls in my locker and I put them on as soon as I get to work.  \n\nApparently this was not good enough. So I started just staying out of the break room.  Nope. If they came into my zone they started sneezing. They told my boss that I should be forced to get rid of my dog because it was affecting their work.  \n\nThe thing is I know that I'm not the only one with a dog. At least three of the guys I work with have dogs.  \n\nI told my boss that I will never consider rehoming my dog and they can just take some benadryl or something.  \n\nNow they are crying that they might have to quit because they can't work here.  I just don't care but they certainly do. They are saying that I am an asshole for prioritizing my dog over their livelihood.\n\nEdit \n\nMy boss got me the extra coveralls and arranged for the extra washing as an accommodation.

You can\u2019t walk into a store, restaurant, church, doctors offices - literally anywhere - without finding at least one dog owner. If their allergies are that severe they would need to be home bound to stay away from pet hair/dander.  They need allergy meds/shots. So this isn\u2019t your problem. This person can\u2019t rid the world of dogs. So they need a doctor. Or you to figure out what is really causing their issue.", "NTA, they can't change the whole world to accommodate their allergy. What if it was pollen or dust? Would they expect all trees be trimmed and all dust be vacuumed 10 times a day? \n\nIt's ridiculous to expect to give up your dog. You've done everything you could.

Once your issue was resolved if ever there will be another one, mark my words!", "NTA, and frankly the momen they had the barefaced nerve to say you should be forced to get rid of your dog, that's when the voluntary things you've been doing for them should stop. Why should you go out of your way for someone who would be so cruel?\n\nSounds like they need to either find a way to medicate, or leave.

They can quit or stop the dramatics.", "If their allergies are that severe, they have more problems than a single co-workers dog that doesn't set foot in the workplace. NTA, and the co-worker needs to seek medical advice about these severe symptoms. Either that, or they're angling to get fired so they can get unemployment/a lawsuit over disability accommodations.  \n\n\nEdited to add - OP, I mean this in the kindest possible way - do you shower daily? Because if Sneezy is acting up like this around you, it could be a passive-aggressive way of complaining that you don't smell good.", "NTA\n\n\nYour boss is wrong for leaving the issue on your door step. Having a pet is common among people. He should have never singled you out. You did your best to try to help...but ultimately your boss needs to be the one providing accomodations....not you.\n\nAnd if you're that allergic to dogs.... That's unreasonable to expect all your coworkers to re-home their pets. Sounds like they don't want to try anything to prevent issues. There is medication available to help people with allergies like that. Wearing proper clothing, a mask, and gloves goes a long way as well. One of my colleagues has a bad cat allergy. She takes medication and has worked out what works best to help minimize any issues. She has her work area that we don't enter ....if we need something that can't be address over the phone/computer she will come to us. We keep lint rollers around and use those before she comes in our areas.... between that, her keeping distance from us cat people, and wearing a mask for prolonged contact, long sleeves, and just keeping it clean as possible.. she hasn't had any major issues or attacks.,.She would never ask us to re-home our pets.... And yes she has quit jobs before because it didn't work out with her allergy.... But like she told us before...she appreciates our help...but it's her problem to figure out and deal with at the end of the day.", "Definitely NTA.
