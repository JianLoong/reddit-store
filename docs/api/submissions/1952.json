When they use the break room they start sneezing a lot.  I have pictures of my dog at my work station. So they know that I have him. It's not a secret or anything. \n\nThey went to the boss and said that they needed to be accommodated because of their medical condition.  He came to me and asked if I could please do anything.  So I started keeping a clean set of coveralls in my locker and I put them on as soon as I get to work.  \n\nApparently this was not good enough. So I started just staying out of the break room.  Nope. If they came into my zone they started sneezing. They told my boss that I should be forced to get rid of my dog because it was affecting their work.  \n\nThe thing is I know that I'm not the only one with a dog. At least three of the guys I work with have dogs.  \n\nI told my boss that I will never consider rehoming my dog and they can just take some benadryl or something.  \n\nNow they are crying that they might have to quit because they can't work here.  I just don't care but they certainly do. They are saying that I am an asshole for prioritizing my dog over their livelihood.\n\nEdit \n\nMy boss got me the extra coveralls and arranged for the extra washing as an accommodation.

You can\u2019t walk into a store, restaurant, church, doctors offices - literally anywhere - without finding at least one dog owner.

This person can\u2019t rid the world of dogs. So they need a doctor. Or you to figure out what is really causing their issue.", "NTA, they can't change the whole world to accommodate their allergy. What if it was pollen or dust? Would they expect all trees be trimmed and all dust be vacuumed 10 times a day? \n\nIt's ridiculous to expect to give up your dog. You've done everything you could.

Once your issue was resolved if ever there will be another one, mark my words!", "NTA, and frankly the momen they had the barefaced nerve to say you should be forced to get rid of your dog, that's when the voluntary things you've been doing for them should stop. Why should you go out of your way for someone who would be so cruel?\n\nSounds like they need to either find a way to medicate, or leave.

You did your best to try to help...but ultimately your boss needs to be the one providing accomodations....not you.\n\nAnd if you're that allergic to dogs.... That's unreasonable to expect all your coworkers to re-home their pets. Sounds like they don't want to try anything to prevent issues. There is medication available to help people with allergies like that. Wearing proper clothing, a mask, and gloves goes a long way as well. One of my colleagues has a bad cat allergy. She takes medication and has worked out what works best to help minimize any issues. She has her work area that we don't enter ....if we need something that can't be address over the phone/computer she will come to us. We keep lint rollers around and use those before she comes in our areas.... between that, her keeping distance from us cat people, and wearing a mask for prolonged contact, long sleeves, and just keeping it clean as possible.. she hasn't had any major issues or attacks.,.She would never ask us to re-home our pets....

One of the employees burst into the break room and started full out screaming at me! I was so shocked at first that someone 10 years older than my 24 year old self was behaving this way that I completely froze. We\u2019re talking full blown over the top meltdown here people, that would impress even the most enraged toddler!\n\nShe said \u201chow dare I reheat something with shellfish in it\u201d that \u201cshe was deathly allergic and even the SMELL of shellfish COULD KILL HER!!!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for her I was reheating plain old straight up mac n cheese.

I grew up with really bad allergies and took shots for it for about 3 years. They worked great for me.

For the first month my allergies absolutely flared up but it has been in decline to almost nothing now. Something interesting I have found is that while I can gain immunity to reaction from my cat it's not universal. If I go to someone else's house and they have cats I'm still going to get a flare up.", "Or an Afghan Hound!", "I am only quite allergic to certain cats (dander). Most cats give lighter symptoms or it takes a longer time. Still, even I think it is bullshit to get rid of your dog because someone is allergic when they don't even live with you (and even if they do, it is still totally up to you). OP, NTA.

OP shouldn\u2019t have to stay out of the break room, change clothes, or do anything else that isn\u2019t in their job description or goes beyond basic workplace etiquette to accommodate CW\u2019s allergies. That isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility.\n\nBoss is being incredibly unfair to OP by putting the onus on them to accommodate their coworker. The ADA literally defines \u201creasonable\u201d as something that doesn\u2019t create \u201cundue hardship\u201d upon the workplace - which I would say definitely includes forcing an employee to give up their pet. \n\nReasonable would be adjusting CW\u2019s duties so that they aren\u2019t required to go into OP\u2019s zone and providing a separate space for them to eat/ take a break/etc if they are unable to do so at their work station. If CW\u2019s current position requires them to go into OP\u2019s zone, then technically CW can no longer perform the essential functions of their job and should be reassigned. \n\nOr they can just take some fucking Benadryl.", "I know someone who couldnt figure out why her allergies went crazy on one floor of her office building\u2026 until they took down the walls for a remodel and found black mold", "This! My allergies were making me miserable at work for months, it was a coworker who had a wax melter at their desk.

It\u2019s a lot of work keeping the shots up, and the initial time commitment was A LOT. \n\nI had one bad reaction, in the many years I\u2019ve been getting them, that sent me to the hospital. Even though my allergist will argue this for the end of time, I\u2019m convinced it was caused by the new nurse injecting too deep, and the serum getting into my bloodstream too rapidly. I was having heart problems, and was sent to my regular doc, who did a ecg, which came back irregular, multiple times, so I was then sent to the ER. After many hours there, my triponin level went from elevated, to ok, as I laid in the er for hours. Was then sent off to a cardiologist, who confirmed there is absolutely nothing wrong with my heart.
