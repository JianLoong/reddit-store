Maybe tell him how she thought he would propose at the pumpkin patch and then give him ideas that he may then take as his own. \n\nBut, on the other hand, if he really knows her so little maybe it is good that he fails by giving her a proposal she hates and then she will say no. Still, I\u2019d give it a go. He made it your business when he told you about his plans. NTA", "maybe don't tell your friend but give your suggestions to the bf in the most respectful way possible...", "Sounds like BF is planning what he would love rather than what she would love. Tell him she won't like his plan and think up some stuff with him she would really love and let him pick from them his favourite. If he still wants to go ahead with his own plan then it's his own problem. NTA by the way.", "NTA.  \\_BUT\\_ i think you are using the wrong term here.  Go ahead and give your friend advice, and why.  PErfectly ok.   BAsed on the tone of the post, it almost appears that you are wanting to order him to change his plans.  Which I imagine won't be received well.   \"Hey buddy, that sounds really romantic.  I was thinking tho,  doesn't she hate hiking?..\"  vs \"MAx,  you CANNOT do this.  You are making a huge fucking mistake, and you WILL NOT do it.  You WILL do it this other way\"", "YWNBTA for telling him why you think it isn't a great idea.  If he's a decent dude, he'll appreciate the input.  He might have other reasons for doing it this way you don't know about.", "YTA. If he is so clueless that she hates it, that\u2019s important info your friend needs to have to make her decision. You know your friend but aren\u2019t in their relationship. Perhaps there is something specific and unique to this type of experience she\u2019s shared with him and not you.

As someone who proposed recently - *please* do tell him. Chances are, he wants to make it as special as possible for her and any advice is good. Thats not to say he'll listen to you, but any half decent dude would want to be warned before he proposed in a way that his partner didn't like. \n\nThat being said, maybe phrase it more gently than \"telling him to change his plans\". Don't try to make him feel bad about his initial plan not being perfect. Explain the reasons why you think she might not like it, and offer some alternatives. At the end of the day you both want your friend to be happy.", "It's not a circus, it's one of the more important days in a couple's life.\n\nLet him read this list.\n\nIf she says he doesn't care if she is cold in a place that doesn't mean anything to her, tell her.\n\nNTA Save your friend.", "ESH.  If he can\u2019t figure out what she likes, that\u2019s on both of them.  She should be clear if she has preferences.  It\u2019s not your job.  If you want to try to help him, make simple comments, \u201cyou know how much she hates the cold,\u201d \u201cshe loved being in the pumpkin patch with you and thought you might propose there,\u201d etc.  He could be thinking in a way that you aren\u2019t, take her on a hike in the snow and when she is annoyed and tired, set her at a beautiful spot all covered in snow and propose.  She might find it funny later, the trudge through the snow, being cold and grumpy, only to find out that he loves her even like that and was still willing to propose.  Cue Hallmark card ending.", "I would say that ywnbta if you do it politely with constructive criticism. Don't even just think about doing it for him, do it for your friend. Lots of people still say yes, even when it wasn't their preferred proposal, so you would be preventing her from having a crappy proposal that she can't get back. He might just have it in his head that this seems romantic, when he's not thinking about the important details like weather and having to walk, not just appear in the pretty wooded area where it's a picture perfect proposal. He might be overcomplicating everything.", "Mostly NTA if you plan on just giving suggestions. Y T A if you push. Maybe have some girl chat with your friend about perfect proposal scenarios and slip him some solid ideas instead of just saying \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d.", "YTA. Its their proposal, not yours. Sometimes the best proposals are great when they dont go right. Get back in your lane far as how they handle their own relationship. Its not your place to criticize it no matter how you feel.", "YTA", "She already talked to him about it, hes not ok and ignored her advice. She omitted that from her post.", "I agree. He should know that she wouldn\u2019t enjoy that plan at all. Is it a habit of his to ignore her likes/dislikes in favor of what he wants to do?", "I can echo this. Give him the agency to choose what he wants to do. It's his idea to propose and their moment together. \n\nWhat I can say is that after asking many friends about their proposals - whether cheesey/over the top/or private - it's their moment to share. \n\nI would definitely go with the suggestions route and step out of the way regardless of what he chooses.", "That's exactly it. She's described her dream proposal to me and that is nowhere near it not even close.", "She already talked to him once, he ignored her advice... so shes turning to reddit to get validation in going after him again. Maybe the boyfriend knows something the op doesnt?", "I don\u2019t that makes OP an AH. She\u2019s just concerned for her friend.", "Shes already confronted the guy about it, he already ignored her. Op forgot to print that she knows about it because they already talked - and turned it down.", "Shes pushing. Shes already talked to the guy and he turned her suggestions down.", "This isn't about how I feel, it's about what I know. \n\nYou know there's a polite way to disagree with someone.", "Reasoning?", "Have you told him what that is? If you have and he's choosing to go against it then he's already made his decision and it's his problem now. If not you'd better tell him quick before he loses his chance.", "Share it with him.", "Op already talked to the guy and he ignored her advice.", "Ignore this person, OP. Just phrase it nicely with the exact points you brought up here. Like \"Do you think she'll like it, its cold, we might get lost etc\" and if he says yes after that, then you need to step away. Sometimes people are clueless and miss the big picture. Do not tell your friend beforehand though, that will end your friendship.", "Maybe the BF wants to propose in a certain way.  There's two people's wants and wishes involved in this whole thing, and his idea of the proposal matters too, certainly it matters more than your ideas.", "Like wanting to control someone else's proposal?
