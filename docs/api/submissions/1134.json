I asked my son a couple days ago how it\u2019s going with his long-term substitute and he said he doesn\u2019t like him. When I asked why, he said that they don\u2019t ever get recess anymore because every time someone is \u201cbad\u201d they get a minute taken off. I thought he meant the specific kid got a minute off so my initial advice was \u201cwell don\u2019t be bad then\u201d but he confirmed that he wasn\u2019t being bad, it was 2-3 kids that were consistently ruining it for the entire class because the whole class got a minute taken away and so far it\u2019s been the entire recess time every day (it\u2019s been a week and a half).\n\nI reached out to the sub through our school app and voiced my concern that the kids are missing their last days of outside recess\u2019s before snow hits and it seems unreasonable to punish 20 students for the acts of a few. He said that if the kids wanted recess that badly then they would tell the other kids to not act up so they could all go. I told him I disagree with the thought process that other elementary aged kids should be responsible for correcting the behavior of their peers. Especially at this age when bullying starts to ramp up. Children should not have to paint targets on their backs because an adult is threatening them with a punishment. If these other kids are always the cause of no recess then he should be contacting their parents or disciplining them individually. He said that if I felt that strongly then I could take it to the principal\u2026.so I did. \n\nI have had 4 kids total in this district and my 4th grader is the youngest and while I\u2019m not in the PTA I would say I\u2019m active in the school and the principal knows me well and knows that I am usually on board with teachers using their own methods and backing them up if my child is doing something wrong. But I also believe that teachers need to discipline in a fair way, and keeping an entire class of students cooped up indoors instead of getting some much needed exercise in the middle of their day because the teacher can\u2019t handle a couple kids is not it. \n\nThe principal agreed with me, she said that pulling recess is a common punishment when the majority of the class is acting up and the teacher can\u2019t pinpoint certain students, but that revoking it every day was not in alignment with their policies. My son came home yesterday very happy about having recess (it\u2019s been unseasonably warm so they had a GREAT time) and said they had a new substitute. I reached back out to the principal because I felt bad thinking this man lost his job, and she said that he\u2019s still working as a sub, but the district feels he\u2019d be better suited to covering specials (music, art, etc) rather than an extended stint for a main class. This means he\u2019ll get less work, which wasn\u2019t my intention (I thought she\u2019d just tell him to stop being a hard ass and let the kids have recess), and while my husband agrees that it needed to be addressed he feels that going to the principal was too far.

You did nothing more than what he told you to do. \n\nSubs (in most states) do not have any of the same training or requirements that full time teachers do\u2014 they likely took a chance on him after knowing him as a part time sub only to be reminded that he has no further teaching experience, so they decided to find someone who did. It happens. I\u2019ve had great subs for my class before who absolutely flopped as long term subs. Just a part of the field.", "NTA. Recess is a vital part of the school day. Kids aren't made to just sit and study all day. They need a break with movement and other stimuli. My elementary school had both morning and afternoon recess, so that we weren't facing huge blocks of time in the classroom. \n\nIf the same 4 kids are misbehaving every single day, those 4 kids need to be addressed rather than punishing the entire class. It doesn't need to be where the class can see it, but you can't stunt a child's activities constantly due to a few kids.\n\nAll you did was report troubling behavior. The school decided how to deal with it. You're not at fault.", "NTA. I agree maybe the principal was too harsh nd should have just told him to allow recess...but who knows, maybe he had other complaints or a bad or noncompliant reaction when they discussed it. You couldn't have known that would happen and were just appropriately advocating for the kids.", ">He said that if the kids wanted recess that badly then they would tell the other kids to not act up so they could all go.\n\nNope. This right here makes this guy an asshole sundae with a cherry on top. Fourth graders aren\u2019t going to listen to other fourth graders telling them what to do. It\u2019s the teacher\u2019s responsibility to grow up and to discipline the kids that are doing wrong- not to punish the entire class by acting like a prison warden. \n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. There are good long-term subs and bad ones. There are also good and bad teachers. I've had both. I had a dumpster fire of a high-functioning alcoholic as my fourth grade teacher who was replaced by the nicest woman. Conversely, I had a nasty sub in high school who told me to shut up and sleep in class if I objected to her forced proselytizing as she forewent the regular teacher's plan. There's absolutely nothing wrong with voicing your concerns to the school's administrators. particularly if they're known to act in the best interests of students. Sometimes that means reassigning teachers who aren't fit for a particular role. You did did the right thing. The ultimate decision lies with the school.", "NTA.

That would only be the case if either (a) he hadn't been informed of those polices in advance, or (b) the school over-reacted and took more extreme corrective action than necessary.

But it seemed more like he just didn\u2019t want to have to address the issues with the parents. And honestly I wonder whether these kids are really \u201cbad\u201d or if they\u2019re just super talkative and excitable and it irritates him because my son said they\u2019ve never missed out on recess before, even the \u201cbad\u201d kids, so clearly his teacher doesn\u2019t think that they act up enough to warrant staying in."]}
