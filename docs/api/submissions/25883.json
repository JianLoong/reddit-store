She didn\u2019t want to do laundry and wouldn\u2019t cook for herself. She neglected all of her chores and spent most of her time sleeping in her room.\n\nI told her to do the dishes after dinner because it was her turn and she said she was too tired and went to bed. I yelled at her and called her a spoiled brat, but she didn\u2019t care and went straight to bed. She has been frustrating to deal with.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t doing her laundry, so I started doing it myself (because she can\u2019t go to school in dirty clothes like she started doing) and then just poured the clothes on the floor since she was too lazy/tired to put them away. I do expect my kids to do their own laundry and also put away their clothes themselves, which she knows, but now is refusing to do.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t vacuum her room when it was her turn to vaccum but I did everyone elses. If she wants to be lazy and live in filth, that is her right. I made sure not to clean her bathroom or room when I\u2019m suppose to in my weekly chores since she isn\u2019t doing her own weekly chores to help everyone else.\n\nBut I noticed her older sister was doing things for her. When I would throw her clothes on the floor, she\u2019d go in and fold them and put them away. Everyone besides me would still include her room in chores, and they weren\u2019t getting onto her for not taking part. It was frustrating.\n\nI told them all they were enabling her and needed to stop. She was going to turn into a spoiled brat that thinks everyone will do everything for her. But they kept doing it.\n\nWell, it turns out she has lupus. She was recently hospitalized for it, and is getting treatment. My family is upset at me because they believe her being chronically ill is what led to her being tired all the time, and said I was heartless with how I treated her. The doctor agreed that was likely the case, but I didn\u2019t know she was sick. She should have told me that she was sick. I just didn\u2019t want her to grow up being entitled and horrible. AITA? I don\u2019t think I was wrong in how I treated her. I was being a parent and refusing to be taken advantage of.

I was sixteen. Has your daughter shown previous behaviour that led you to believe this was a stunt rather than something serious? I'm thinking no, because you probably would've mentioned that in your post as justification for your actions. You disregarding this turnaround for months is extremely wild and yes, heartless.", "YTA. Try talking to your child instead of doing petty shit like putting her clothes on the floor. Embarrassing", "YTA, and you're STILL the asshole for how you're treating her.

You're her mother! How could YOU not tell?", "YTA\n\n>She should have told me that she was sick.\n\nBased on how you talk about your daughter and how you've been treating her the past few months, I doubt you would have believed her if she had told you.", "YTA. When a 15 year old\u2019s *siblings* are actually going to far as to do her chores for her, it seems like a massive red flag that something is off. Even the closest of siblings seem highly unlikely to do this. You throwing her stuff on the floor & assuming she was lazy while she spent all of her time in bed seems like you deliberately ignored her problem. The fact that everyone else is upset with you also speaks volumes. I\u2019d be more interested in why you believe you *aren\u2019t* TA because this seems pretty clear!", "YTA. My mother did something similar to me when I wasn\u2019t diagnosed with diabetes type 1 yet but very ill at the age of 16. She kept scolding me because I was so sluggish and always got nauseous after meals (\u201cYou always feel sick when it\u2019s your time to do the dishes\u201d) and kept yelling for me to get out of bed because I slept 16 hours a day. But she was very sorry when I finally was diagnosed an apologised profusely. She thought I was just a lazy teenager and she was really beating herself up over that. You don\u2019t even seem sorry. Did you apologise?\n\nETA: and my mother learned from it. A few years ago she took care of me when I was discharged from the hospital after having my baby. I wasn\u2019t feeling good and the nurse that was taking care of me at home didn\u2019t take me seriously. But my mother did. She called the hospital and I literally heard her say: \u201cMy daughter knows her body and if she feels something is wrong than something is wrong. She doesn\u2019t complain easily.\u201d She was right, there was something wrong and her advocacy saved my life.", "INFO: have you apologised to her for how you treated her?", "YTA\n\nIn your stand as a parent, who \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be taken advantage of,\u201d you completely failed in your responsibility to notice that your daughter had a drastic behaviour change (you did do that part, well done, three cheers for you) and to follow up.

Instead of trying to figure out something was wrong when it clearly was u went off on her. I don't see how ud even think there's a possibility u weren't being an ahole.

To not feel bad after you treated her like shit when she had fucking Lupus! Some people shouldn't be a parent...", "Omg YTA - if your child is literally exhausted and sleeping all the time and cannot do the basic of activities, noting the fatigue, that should set off red flags that they could be sick. Not that \u201comg theyre so lazy and spoiled\u201d.\n\nYoure not perceptive", "YTA. How did the rest of your family know your daughter was ill and needing slack and you didn't? It doesn't seem you communicate with her very well. Parenting is more than barking commands.", "YTA - you should of went to a doctor or AT LEAST a therapist the moment you noticed the behavior changes. No one decides to wake up suddenly and decide to be an asshole for now on. \n\nI hope this becomes a lesson for you. If she never went to the hospital and died on her disease she would have the last months of her life in living hell with her health, school, and even home life. Then the only person who was caring for her was punished for it.", "OP watched too much House MD and thinks its never lupus. But seriously, YTA. Your daughter has a serious change in her behavior and your instinct is that she's lazy and to punish her? Even if it wasn't an auto-immune disease, maybe she had a major depressive disorder, maybe she experienced some sort of trauma. Its great that you've taught her that she can't rely on you for help, since she'll reach out to someone who actually loves and cares for her instead.", "YTA. But it\u2019s a lesson learnt on your part. From now on actually listen to your daughter and believe how she\u2019s feeling. Be more mindful of her feelings and have empathy towards her- I understand your parent\u2019 role but your daughter was clearly trying to communicate how she wasn\u2019t feeling good. Learn from this and be open with your daughter, support and help her when she needs it.", "YTA.  You're not old enough to be this ill-informed about mental health and chronic illnesses and how they can effect your mental health.  Do better for your children.  It's sad that her older siblings were better advocates for her than you were.", "YTA god this is horrific, your poor daughter, news flash if somebody is sleeping for ages and ages there's something wrong either with their mental and or physical health, i can't believe you think you're in the right, you should feel terrible and i'm glad your family and her doctor called you out 'didn't want her to grow up entitled and horrible' like you legitimately think you were right in making her hurt even more than she already was, what's the path going forward? you'll still blame her despite her diagnosis probably", "So let me get this straight: Your other children figured out something was wrong and had empathy and helped their sister. But their own fucking parent couldn\u2019t figure it out? Seriously?\n\nShe likely didn\u2019t know what was wrong. She just knew she didn\u2019t feel good and was tired. And she did tell you that! You just didn\u2019t fucking listen. So no, you don\u2019t get to blame her even a little. \n\nAnd even if she hadn\u2019t told you, she\u2019s the child. You\u2019re supposed to be the damn parent.

You must be a pretty bad parent if you had no clue your child was sick until they were literally hospitalized.", "She should have told you she was sick? \n\nShe drastically stopped doing her chores and wanted to sleep all the time. You're only reaction was to be angry she wouldn't cook or clean for herself. This entire post is still you being angry she wouldn't do what you wanted her too...\n\nYOu have shown not one ounce of care for her.

Ask her whats wrong ???\nFuck...you sound like you dont even like her\n\n\nYTA   massive assole you are", "YTA. 15 year olds are notoriously bad communicators with their parents. You need to be the parent. You need to be the one doing the communication, keeping an eye on her, asking how her day was, asking how she is feeling, asking what is wrong when she exhibits unusual behavior. It sounds like you are not much of a parent, but more of a boss.", "YTA \n\n>My kid had became extremely lazy is the last few months when she wasn\u2019t before. \n\nYou should rephrased this as: I as a \u201cmom\u201d became extremely lazy in the last few months. \n\nHer abrupt change in behavior should have been an alarming signal to you that something was off with your poor child. You didn\u2019t parent her. You just gave her more chores without asking what was wrong. You know? What good parents do. Communicate not retaliate. \n\nInstead of worrying about her welfare, your initial reaction was to harbor resentment against her. Why is that? \n\nDo you even love her?\n\n*Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.*\n\nCheck your emotions and have some compassion.", " YTA.\n\nSO! This is almost exactly what happened to me (as the kid). I had Lyme disease (very similar to Lupus) and I've had it for most of my life but was only diagnosed at 26. I also have a friend with Lupus so I know a lot about it. Chronic diseases literally destroy you as a person. It's not feeling tired or exhausted. They fuck up your nervous system, hormones, chemicals in your brain. It's very likely your daughter isn't even capable of feeling happiness, motivation or peace anywhere near the level you are simply because of reactions her body is having to trying to survive. Literally patients with this have lower endorphin lvls, dopamine, literally anything that makes your brain satisfied and healthy. You obviously don't even have a comprehensive understanding of how far this chronic illness effects every facet of her life. You are not seeing her sick, you are seeing every factor in her life be effected by something that is keeping her as her worst self. This is the whole friggin point of parenting. To be there for your children or your family when they need you. And instead of YOU recognizing that something was wrong you had the gall to call your child spoiled, entitled and taking advantage of you? She's 15!!! How the hell is she supposed to know she's this sick. You're the grown up, the parent, with significantly more life experience on health and absolutely you should have more experience in recognizing your kid's health.\n\nDo you seriously think this is going to stop here? Lupus is not easy. For some people this is life long. You need to start thinking about this as a disability because she's going to need your help with treatment and recovery for years to come, and for the love of god don't you dare try and convince that girl, who had no choice in this, that who she has become in trying to survive an illness like this is wrong and not okay. YOU WOULD DO NO BETTER IN HER SHOES.", "YTA\nBe prepared to have her go LC/NC with you. Maybe if you actually had sat her down and asked her if she was feeling alright instead of having the typical \u201cShe\u2019s not sick- she\u2019s just being lazy/entitled\u201d attitude, she could\u2019ve gotten the help she needed earlier and actually feel better.", "So your child's behavior drastically changed over a short amount of time your idea was to call her lazy instead of trying to figure out what was happening to her? YTA of the highest order. And it seems like you're the lazy one with how lazily you acted instead of trying to you know, be a decent parent. Why do people like you have kids? I genuinely do not understand it. Shame on you", "YTA for being so stupid that it didn't occur to you that you, as her parent, are supposed to notice things like a change in your daughter's energy level and TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR to find out what's wrong before she needs hospitalization.\n\nYou're a negligent parent and after the first week should've taken her to the doctor to figure out what was wrong. Instead you decided she was just lazy and treated her badly. You're a piece of work!\n\nETA. You don't think medical negligence and being a shitty parent is wrong? You were being a judgemental B, not a parent. A parent would've realized being tired meant there was something wrong. \n\nI hope there are adults who love your daughter and are willing to take her in. You've proven you're a bad parent to her and she shouldn't be willing to live under your roof.", "YTA. She was suddenly feeling more tired and sleeping a lot more than before, and your instinct was to be mad at her for being lazy? Why weren't you worried about her? Why are you, with your daughter that you behaved horribly towards recently hospitalized, still do not think you did anything wrong?", "YTA.. Your child changed her behavior, became very lethargic and your first thought wasn't there might be something medically wrong with her?!?!?!?! You never even tried to figure out what was wrong!!!! You just decided that she was being a lazy spoiled brat and you STILL don't think you were wrong after being told by DOCTORS that the LUPUS was the most likely the cause! \n\nWTF is wrong with you!!!!! you were not being taken advantage of, YOUR CHILD NEEDED/NEEDS MEDICAL HELP for a very serious disease!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You don't even seem to care about fact that your daughter body is literally attacking itself and has NO CURE!!!! you are to concerned about trying to be right because the fact that you didn't know and she never told you. Your the parent it is your job to pay attention to your children and realize something might be off.", "YTA. Personality changes (like suddenly seeming chore-avoidant when they weren't before) aren't spoiled brat behavior, they're a cause for concern. You don't jump to yelling, you start with asking questions and figuring out what the cause is.\n\nShe DID tell you she was sick, you just didn't hear it. Maybe in not so many words, but someone who is usually pretty good at keeping on top of their chores suddenly being too tired and exhausted all of the time is absolutely telling you \"hey something is wrong, please pay attention.\"", "YTA. When someone has a major and sudden change like your child clearly did, instead of yelling at them like a lunatic you're supposed to show some compassion because something is CLEARLY wrong. And you should never, ever call your child nasty names like you did. You're an awful person and a bad mother. Your family will never forget this and hopefully never forgive. You need therapy and to do some SERIOUS introspection about why you reacted how you did.", "She\u2019s a child she likely did not know she was sick. It\u2019s on you as the parent to see what they don\u2019t, to learn better. You messed up- apologize to her and promise to listen better next time. I was going to say *gentle* but now feel firm YTA based on the last two sentences. The best thing you can do as a parent right now is admit you were wrong, you had good intentions but you were wrong. You were so focused on preventing one behavioral concern that you missed a major health concern. Own it, apologize and learn from it.", "You are totally an asshole. Parent through example, not abuse. Wow. \n\nNot all illnesses are visible. At a minimum, I would have worried about her mental health.  At least it sounds like she has supportive siblings. \n\nYou really need to do some self reflecting.", "YTA\n\nI understand you want her to do her chores, but after seeing this was not stopping and she was not rebeling for no reason, you should have been worried instead of angry\n\nAnd it looks like all her family, but you helped in that period. You didn't think about talking with them instead of being mad with them, too?", "YTA\n\nOnce her behavior changed, you should have assumed something was wrong and tried to speak with her about it.", "YTA You're daughter should've told you she had a chronic illness she had no way of knowing she had!! Of course that makes sense!!

They are usually physically ill or mentally ill. You saw a huge change in your child's behavior and instead of taking her to a doctor, you shamed her and ridiculed her. Of course YTA", "YTA\n\nYou didn't have to know. Your daughter didn't have to know but honestly, even if she had known and told you, would you have believed her? If she was lazy since forever then you would be dealing with a spoiled brat. If something in someone's behavior changes suddenly, there's 50/50 (or even more) chance that they are dealing with an illness. You were wrong for how you treated her. You were wrong for how you didn't care enough about your own child that your brought into this world to take her to a doctor.

She didn\u2019t want to do laundry and wouldn\u2019t cook for herself. She neglected all of her chores and spent most of her time sleeping in her room.\n\nI told her to the dishes after dinner because it was her turn and she said she was too tired and went to bed. I yelled at her and called her a spoiled brat, but she didn\u2019t care and went straight to bed. She has been frustrating to deal with.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t doing her laundry, so I started doing it myself (because she can\u2019t go to school in dirty clothes like she started doing) and then just poured the clothes on the floor since she was too lazy/tired to put them away. I do expect my kids to do their own laundry and also put away the clothes themselves, which she knows, but now is refusing to do.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t vacuum her room when it was her turn to vaccum but I did everyone elses. If she wants to be lazy and live in filth, that is her right. I made sure not to clean her bathroom or room when I\u2019m suppose to in my weekly chores since she isn\u2019t doing her own weekly chores to help everyone else.\n\nBut I noticed her older sister was doing things for her. When I would throw her clothes on the floor, she\u2019d go in and fold them and put them away. Everyone besides me would still include her room in chores, and they weren\u2019t getting onto her for not taking part. It was frustrating.\n\nI told them all they were enabling her and needed to stop. She was going to turn into a spoiled brat that thinks everyone will do everything for her. But they kept doing it.\n\nWell, it turns out she has lupus. She was recently hospitalized for it, and is getting treatment. My family is upset at me because they believe her being chronically ill is what led to her being tired all the time, and said I was heartless with how I treated her. The doctor agreed that was likely the case, but I didn\u2019t know she was sick. She should have told me that she was sick. I just didn\u2019t want her to grow up being entitled and horrible. AITA? I don\u2019t think I was wrong in how I treated her. I was being a parent and refusing to be taken advantage of. She is 15.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m just not understanding where OP\u2019s consistently uncharitable attitude towards her own daughter is coming from.", "This. OPs reaction should've been to take her to the doctor, but decided to assume her child had the worst possible intentions. Even the other kid(s) sensed that something was wrong and helped, but OP threw the kid's clothes on the floor instead. I have a feeling OP won't be able to see the flaw in her own actions, or accept that their other kid knew better and was more astute and empathetic than she was.\n\nOne point of parenting is ensuring that your kids grow up to be better people than you are. I congratulate you for succeeding in that, at least.", "Agreed. My mom owned her own mistakes in raising me. I appreciate that so much. She admitted to being wrong before I as an adult was able accept and verbalize it. It makes a world of difference for healing when a parent owns it.", "Thank you for being the type of mom to fight for her child. I have a mom like this too. Actually she is the one that is like go to the doctor stupid. Gee mom it can't be that serious. Yeah one brain tumor later. I am so very glad your son has you.", "What was wrong with your son?", "Probably I Def feel bad for the kid", "And here she is making all about herself!!", "I just can't believe that op just...blew her kid off completely like this.   I just can't wrap my head around it.", "He had an autoimmune response to a flu he'd had earlier on.  It's called Henoch-Schonlein purpura."]}
