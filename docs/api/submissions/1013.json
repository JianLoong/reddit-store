I would ask my wife to get a couple of premade items per shopping trip if you can\u2019t participate in shopping due to your work hours and you are stuck with leftovers and frozen food when you get back from work at 3am. Also if your wife picks up a premade item for your daughter, ask her to get a spare one for you as well. If there are extras, chances are that your daughter will also get to eat the food she was craving before it\u2019s gone.

NTA but its better to come from you than mom.", "I absolutely love this outlook on parenting! Parenting is absolutely a team effort, but this definitely seems like something you might need to talk to your daughter about personally because 1) you were the person she insulted via her note 2) this is a moment where you can tell her that passive aggressive (and regular aggressive) notes are inappropriate ways to express issues in shared living situations. She\u2019s going to end up with roommates who hate her if she does this after moving out. She will be labeled as the crazy roommate if she does this. A note asking to be able to find a time to discuss an issue in person is more appropriate, or asking that an item is replaced if eaten, lost, or broken is more appropriate (lost/broken being applicable to a roommate situation and not this current one), and 3) if \u201cfood she got\u201d was paid for with YOUR money, THAT IS FAMILY FOOD!\n\nRegarding your current situation you\u2019re NTA. For starters, your daughter cannot claim food as her\u2019s if she\u2019s put it on the shopping list and you pay for it. **That is family food**. If it\u2019s something for a recipe then she can leave a note on the fridge *politely* asking that it not be eaten because she needs it to cook whatever dish she has planned for herself that week. Second, if she paid for it herself, she needs to write her name on it big enough that it will get seen (although lots of people will freak out and say that people who do that are assholes even when they *tell you to do that*) or have a specific spot for stuff she *actually buys* in the fridge/freezer. She shouldn\u2019t be calling you names for eating unmarked food or food not placed in whatever spot is agreed on as her spot. She can ask you to replace food you ate *that she actually bought*. If it\u2019s an item that\u2019s typically in the house and there\u2019s only one left then it needs to be put on a shopping list before it runs out, otherwise there\u2019s going to be an argument over who ate the last one of whatever. The amount of times we have this argument about Trader Joe\u2019s ravioli is too many times\u2026 \nTelling your wife to talk to her about this will not be effective enough imo, it does need to come from you this time. Suddenly changing and making her pay for everything of yours that she\u2019s eaten in the past will result in a huge massive argument that will not go well and leave everyone feeling angry. Saying that anything that she HAS NOT PERSONALLY BOUGHT, LABELED/PUT IN HER SPOT FOR FOOD is fair game is 100% appropriate though.
