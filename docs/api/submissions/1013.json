Parenting is absolutely a team effort, but this definitely seems like something you might need to talk to your daughter about personally because 1) you were the person she insulted via her note 2) this is a moment where you can tell her that passive aggressive (and regular aggressive) notes are inappropriate ways to express issues in shared living situations. She\u2019s going to end up with roommates who hate her if she does this after moving out. She will be labeled as the crazy roommate if she does this.

If it\u2019s something for a recipe then she can leave a note on the fridge *politely* asking that it not be eaten because she needs it to cook whatever dish she has planned for herself that week. Second, if she paid for it herself, she needs to write her name on it big enough that it will get seen (although lots of people will freak out and say that people who do that are assholes even when they *tell you to do that*) or have a specific spot for stuff she *actually buys* in the fridge/freezer. She shouldn\u2019t be calling you names for eating unmarked food or food not placed in whatever spot is agreed on as her spot. She can ask you to replace food you ate *that she actually bought*. If it\u2019s an item that\u2019s typically in the house and there\u2019s only one left then it needs to be put on a shopping list before it runs out, otherwise there\u2019s going to be an argument over who ate the last one of whatever. The amount of times we have this argument about Trader Joe\u2019s ravioli is too many times\u2026 \nTelling your wife to talk to her about this will not be effective enough imo, it does need to come from you this time. Suddenly changing and making her pay for everything of yours that she\u2019s eaten in the past will result in a huge massive argument that will not go well and leave everyone feeling angry.

He really made it a point that he is the highest earner of the whole family, so if it's in the fridge, it's his.

It would be a cold day in hell if I ever told my father who was supporting me, that he couldnt eat \"my food\"....the fact that he even \"asked\" to label it? If daughter was merely and adult, living at home but self sufficient, I could understand...But the daughter is only an \"adult\" by age...She's clearly still a \"child\"...HIs house...His rules..If she doesn't like the rules or set up..Move...I feel there is much bigger issues going on here...I kinda feel bad for him...He is not getting younger...sacrificing his whole life for his children/daughter who is ungrateful..\n\nIt's shrimp...like it's not even a big freaking deal...There are people who have REAL PROBLEMS in this world ya know?", "Uhhhm how is he supposed to know the daughter bought that lol", "That was my thought..there are way bigger issues here...but then I kinda think it's abnormal for a 24 year old to still be so dependent on the parents...living at home because the cost of living is astronomical is normal at 25, heck at 35 these days..but living at home and being 100 percent dependent on your parents seems a bit odd....but having a child the same age makes me bias that all young adults the same age are at similar points...any young kid i know that age are starting their careers, living with roommates etc....god help the whatever future boss his daughter has..", "I absolutely think it\u2019s hilarious That Reddit thinks because someone supports you that they are entitled to what you personally buy.

At an industry happy hour my new coworker was saying her salary (breadwinner) covered all the household bills and expenses (mortgage, healthcare, kids, groceries, etc...) Her husband's salary covered their yearly vacation and savings. It worked really well for them bc they each knew what they had to cover each month, it kept accounting super simple, and they didn't have some complicated budget bc one paycheck was covering their day to day. I was super impressed and thought it sounded really rational.", "No one saying it is lol \ud83d\ude02 \n\nIt\u2019s just weird to bring up after a mistake.

Or they wouldn't eat a pizza that I usually bought because I don't like olives, mushrooms, pepperoni,spinach or ineapple. But we talked about this things.And we put a note on the container saying who it belongs. The rest were fair game. They live in the same house. One person buys all food, and if she wanted that for herself she should say it. Even the dad said that puting a note would have been ok, and he wouldn't have eaten it.
