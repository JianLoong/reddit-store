One day she didn't respond to his texts (just links and stuff he found funny, not \"WHY AREN'T YOU RESPONDING?!\" stalker crap) at all for the entire day. By late evening, he'd tried calling a few times with no response, and he was freaking out with worry. It wasn't that he EXPECTS her to be available on demand; it's that she had significantly deviated from her usual behavior. So I encouraged him to call the police in her town for a wellness check\u2014for a mostly healthy, non-geriatric adult.\n\nIt turned out she was feeling even more introverted than usual and didn't want to talk to anyone, so she turned her phone off. She said he wasn't the first person in her life who's done this, and she knows she needs to get better about giving a heads up to the people she talks to multiple times a day when she does this.\n\nThe point is it's about what's reasonable for a given situation. A geriatric man who lives alone with a limited support network? I'd find calling for a welfare check after a MONTH of NC reasonable, let alone three.

Nobody will do anything without a diagnosis or a court order, and to get that diagnosis she has to go in willingly. \n\nTo get a judicial order? I don't even know what it takes because her sons' lawyer insists they don't have enough evidence. And this is after the woman caused a kitchen fire that left her living in a hotel for six months. \n\nDo everything you can to convince him to willingly get a mental evaluation. Everything. Because that is the only way you're going to get enough legal leverage to make sure he's taken care of. \n\nIf the bar at which any layman on the street will say \"yeah, that person is no longer competent,\" is one foot high, the bar for the judicial system is one hundred feet high. Judges HATE taking away a person's right to self determination. If you can get him to see a doctor voluntarily or if he does something that's a clear and present danger to others are about the only ways that something will be done.\n\nI am so, so sorry that you have to deal with this.
