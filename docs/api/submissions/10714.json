He is 80 and lives in the Southern US while DH and I live in Canada. My DH has been worried about his dad for 3 months now. His phone number is disconnected and we haven't been able to get ahold of him. He is single and lives alone. I and my DH have previously asked my FIL to keep in touch at least once a month to let us know how he is, but he continues to go no contact for months at a time. He's a kind hearted man but has been taken advantage of by others i.e allowed someone to stay with him who then robbed him. We are also worried about his memory starting to lapse. \n\nMy DH hadn't slept well for the last week worrying about my FIL. We havent heard from him in over 3 months. There have been no disagreements and he's always been welcome to stay in our home when he visits (which is rare cuz he hates coming to Canada). I hate seeing DH worried and stressed so last night I called the police in his area and asked for a wellness check. They found him safe and sound and gave him the phone. Sure enough he had forgotten my name and claimed he spoke with us last week. He was irate (he's staunchly against law enforcement) and told me to butt out. My DH was happy I did call the police and I am happy to take the fall and be blamed for calling them but FIL said I invaded his privacy and traumatized him. \n\nNow I think I TA because yes, he's a grown man. But I came here to ask for a verdict.\n\nETA 1) the one friend/neighbor we knew moved away last year and doesn't see him often. \n2) we were supposed to see him in December but my husband ended up in emergency surgery and can't travel until the end of March. We didn't get a refund from the flight. \n3) we are currently short on cash as I'm the only earner and our child has complex medical needs that aren't covered by insurance so travel is tough \n4) I'm doing what I can from here to get him to the doctors but he won't show up. Until he's deemed cognitively incompetent we cant force him to do anything. \n5) we have been trying for years to get him back to the country. He has some legal issues that complicate things crossing the border.", "created_utc": 1677160659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119ycij/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_fil/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They usually text each other dozens of times every day and talk on the phone at least every other day. One day she didn't respond to his texts (just links and stuff he found funny, not \"WHY AREN'T YOU RESPONDING?!\" stalker crap) at all for the entire day. By late evening, he'd tried calling a few times with no response, and he was freaking out with worry. It wasn't that he EXPECTS her to be available on demand; it's that she had significantly deviated from her usual behavior. So I encouraged him to call the police in her town for a wellness check\u2014for a mostly healthy, non-geriatric adult.\n\nIt turned out she was feeling even more introverted than usual and didn't want to talk to anyone, so she turned her phone off. She said he wasn't the first person in her life who's done this, and she knows she needs to get better about giving a heads up to the people she talks to multiple times a day when she does this.\n\nThe point is it's about what's reasonable for a given situation. A geriatric man who lives alone with a limited support network? I'd find calling for a welfare check after a MONTH of NC reasonable, let alone three. Probably even a week, depending on what arrangements you've made with them.\n\nYou can work with social services in his area over the phone.
