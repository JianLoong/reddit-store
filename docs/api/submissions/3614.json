That's not how this works.", "NTA.  She has actively prevented you from forming relationships with the kids. She has prevented you from speaking to them and spending time with them.  Yes, the kids are losing out, but that's all been her choice.  But now that she's revealed her cards, showing that she sees you as an ATM, you'd be foolish to spoil them now.  She's mean AND greedy.", "NTA. Husband's niece treated me like shit when I worked for her, 14 years, ago. She still owes me money! \n\nGreat-niece is in college and a good girl. I was thinking about giving her some money for Christmas. \n\nIssues with Mom don't really transfer to the kids. I just needed to know the kids would keep and use any money for themselves.", "NTA. How does she want you to spoil them without being around them? Not your circus, not your monkeys.", "NTA.", "NTA.   \n\n\nnot your kids. And your SIL most likely badmouth you infront of her kids so yeah, your SIL is just greedy and wanting your money as free money for her kids.

She\u2019s depriving her kids a relationship with their aunt because she doesn\u2019t like her for reasons outside OPs control.", "It sounds like SIL just wants money/material items for the kids, not quality time. OP and husband don't want to be just a bank account, which is fair.", ">She's probably got an eye towards inheritance for the kids knowing you have fertility issues.\n\nYup. My late husband's daughter became a bit friendlier once I became too old to have children of my own. Too bad.   \n\n\nWhen I die, my money will be going to family members on my side plus my husband's grandnieces and grandnephew.", "My guess is just something else to complain and start a fight about.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You honored his memory by doing it in his stead.\n\nOP is questioning whether she's the AH in her situation. The purpose of setting aside something for those kids would be to remove any question of that in her own mind. In her place, I wouldn't tell anyone what I was doing (apart from my own spouse, and that along with a request that he say nothing regardless of provocation). \n\nThe money/whatever would be held, to be turned over at a later time of her choosing. In OP's situation, it would not be until the person receiving it became a legal adult. Imight even wait until the youngest became a legal adult before giving to all of them at once.
