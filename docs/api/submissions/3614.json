In any family it's more natural that you would be closest to your own sister's children than your SILs, even if you and SIL were best friends. Sister's kids are your blood relatives.\n\nSIL has never acknowledged rotten behavior toward you or apologized for it or promised to change her ways. AND now she's weaponized her kids. \n\nIn the long run, maybe the best thing is to just hold your nose, remember that the kids are her innocent victims too, and be their more involved aunt. Don't do it if you don't want to!", "What does she expect you to do, hand over a bunch of cash and then go stand in the corner?! NTA", "How\u2019re you supposed to spoil kids you don\u2019t see or talk to? NTA. She needs a reality check.", "\"She said I was taking our issues out on her kids.\"\n\nOur issues? No, these are HER issues. She needs to deal with them herself.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSIL doesn't want anything to do with you, she just wants your money.     Screw that and SIL (but NOT her lecher of a husband!   Just kidding, obviously!) \n\nHer kids will never know the difference since you have never been active in their lives unless SIL tells them.    Which would make her a bigger AH than she already is.", "Nope", "NTA. She's projecting. She's the one who turned her issues with you into her kid's disadvantage.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s *her* issues (with her own poorly behaved husband, really, she\u2019s just blaming you bc she can\u2019t face facts that are close to home) & *she\u2019s* taking them out on everyone, including her kids. The only one she should be bringing her issues to is her husband, everyone else in this is as innocent as her kids are. Lordy, I hope they get counseling for at least the kids\u2019 sake.", "Just don't engage with her\u2026that's your hubby's problem\u2026but\u2026when buying birthday gifts and Christmas gifts make them equal to what you spend on the  others. They aren\u2019t responsible for their mom's behaviour but since she doesn\u2019t welcome you in her home there's no way to spoil her kids at any other time. Her insecurities with herself and her husband aren\u2019t your fault. His flirting isn't your fault. Let her stew in her own juices.", "NTA. She sucks. If anyone is allowing their issues to negatively impact the kids, it\u2019s her, not you.", "NTA but go easy on the \"spoiling\".\n\nSpoiled kids grow into spoiled adults.", "NTA she\u2019s jealous that you don\u2019t treat her kids like you do your other nieces and nephews. She\u2019s wrong for withholding them from you.", "Can I say round of applause for your husband for putting his sister in her place and respecting your boundaries. Nta", "NTA. The only one with an issue is her.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re not the one letting her kids be affected by your issues, she is. She has chosen to weaponize her children by using them to punish you; she can\u2019t expect you to spoil children she won\u2019t let you have a relationship with. If she doesn\u2019t want them to miss out because of the drama between you (which comes entirely from her anyway), then all she needs to do is stop preventing you from having a relationship with them.", "NTA, I like how she puts it on you by saying 'our' issues. No lady it's your issue, and your alone and the repercussions of that is your children suffer.", "**NTA.**", "NTA", "I'm so glad my BIL and SIL are so nice", "Actually you are allowed to say that on Twitter.   Elon bought Twitter in order to allow Free speech", "My mom witnessed too many women being stuck in abusive marriages and being abandoned by the men who were supposed to take care of them. So she told me, from a young age, that I would be \"one man away from the welfare line\" without a college degree or enough education-skill to provide for myself. \n\nIt seemed harsh when I was younger but I recognize the freedom in it now.", "NTA. You\u2019re damned if you do, and damned if you don\u2019t. Face it. There\u2019s never going to be that Kumbaya moment with SIL. She doesn\u2019t like you, out of pure jealousy. Your sister\u2019s kids are close to you, because you interact with the family. SIL gives you a wide berth, but sees that you have a good relationship with the other children. She wants the same, but she\u2019d have to accept that fact that you aren\u2019t a horrible person. You told her that you\u2019d love to spoil her kids. Maybe she\u2019ll loosen up a bit as she feels less threatened.", "NTA. She the cook that pissed in the poring and now complain that it\u2019s inedible", "She wants it all her own way. Nah.\n\nNah she and by extension are reaping the consequences of HER actions.\n\nYou don\u2019t change anything.\n\nNTA.", "You're not taking your issues out on the kids, you're respecting her boundaries. \n\nIt is always funny to see people put out boundaries and get mad when people respect them. \n\nNTA", "No SIL is taking it out on the kids. It's not your fault.", "Sounds to me like she doesn\u2019t understand that relationships are generational, and if she treats a relative badly it should come as no surprise that her kids will benefit from her lack of foresight in putting a wedge there. She can whine all she likes that her kids don\u2019t have a relationship with you, but why would they? She distanced herself and her kids by extension. My older sister did the same thing with my parents and then had the gall to get upset because her kids had no grandparents. Actions have consequences. NTA.", "u dont have a relationship with them, and u dont owe anyone jack shit just bc ur related. NTA", "Nta. I have a very similar situation where my toxic sister and I went nc. But she and my parents are always harping that I should buy her kids things or take them on outings because otherwise I\u2019m taking it out on the children. My response, if you think I\u2019m such a bad person that you won\u2019t be around me, why would you want your children around me? If you\u2019re the *** trying to steal her man why would she want you anywhere near her kids?", "NTA. She needs to talk to a councelor. Both about her husband and other issues. A good one. Not one who will just confirm what she wants to hear.", "NTA op and you're a better person than me OP because I would have replied \"our issues? The only one with an issue is you. Your husband is a creep and instead of teaching your kids thar that behaviour is not acceptable you bullied me the victim - teaching your kids to victim blame \"", "NTA can't ride 2 horses with 1 ass", "NTA bullies need to be told regularly to watch it. Sounds like she has had a good long run of shoveling on you.  She will always create something so telling her \"nah, homey don't play that,\" is a good thing. Stick to that line and she will learn she's barking up the wrong tree.", "Sounds like she feels entitled to get the money and stuff because the other kids do.", "You are NTA. She is most definitely the AH.", "NTA - she doesn\u2019t want them to have a relationship with you. She wants you to spend money on them.  Offer to build a cash free relationship (think sleepovers, riding bikes, hiking), and see how quick SIL changes her mind.", "NTA, SIL made sure you wouldn\u2019t get too close to her kids so now she can deal with the consequences.", "[removed]", "I would ask her, \u201cOur issues? What do you mean?\u201d and see how she responds. Seems like they are clearly *her* issues.", "This!", "You\u2019re goddamn right and people need to say it more", "I don't get why you would spoil kids you dont even know? And if SIL is treating you like she Def said something about you to kids. NTA", "If it's that unwanted, it's not flirting, it's sexual harassment.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Lady sounds like the kind of woman that bullies SAHMs for having different priorities than her. I do always love to hear someone trying to explain to me what someone else thinks.
