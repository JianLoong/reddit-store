I have a house I bought before knowing, dating and marrying him. Husband wants his name of the deed of that house.\n\nVote of thanks:\n\n1. Thank you for all the insights and suggestions from all the enormous number of people that invested their time into reading it.\n2. A lot of people suggested I bring in my parents and make it even. I didn't want to take that route because 2 wrongs don't make a right and too many cooks spoil the broth.\n3. Finally for all the people you have submitted their decisions whether 'YTA' or 'NTA', thank you. I liked to read all the perspectives.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI talked to my husband. I told him all my insecurities regarding the matter. I told him how I put my blood and sweat into it, how I have spent nights without sleeping and a few without eating to finish it, how I have plastered and painted the walls myself. He was very understanding. He told me how he didn't know all that and what that means to me. He is fine with not being added to the deed. I suggested him to buy another place which is just his and since it is not the end of the world and we will earn more, we will buy even more assets in future and he was fine with all the suggestions. Talking to his parents he told them that it is not happening. They are still upset and think I am wrong and they did say so. This time however, he told them it's not their decision to make and it should not bother them. We are building a life together, he was wrong to bring them into it and he apologised for that. I apologised for just blurting things without giving reasons and we decided to communicate and talk more when it comes to decisions. He suggested weekly sit downs where we just sit and talk stuff about our future, about our day, anything that is making us unhappy or scared, or happy, anything at all. That would be time for us alone.\n\nI did show him the post and he laughed at it. Got a little sad that I would rather tell a bunch strangers about my fears but him. And we will work on it.", "created_utc": 1704218142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wvjsb/aita_for_putting_my_foot_down_and_not_adding_my/", "score": 431, "replies": ["So you talked it out rationally and calmly and it worked for you two more or less. \n\nAnother conflict solved by communicating", "I am so glad you guys worked those things out.  I would say that regardless, you own that home, and it is wonderful that you accomplished it.  If in years to come, you decide to add him to the deed, so be it.  My husband bought our home himself before we were married, but we were together.  We moved into the home together and I worked hard to make it our home.  When we refinanced after being married 10 years, he made sure I was on the deed.  I think you decide what is the best for the two of you.", "Good luck, but I think you also need a prenup", "This was a lovely update. I\u2019m glad you two were able to come to an understanding and he apologized", "I absolutely love when good communication happens. I was so happy to hear this.", "Sounds like you married a good man. Keep working on building & strengthening your lines of communication. It\u2019s a strong foundation for your relationship.", "OP your man tells on you to his parents.", "In order for your property to be exclusively yours or his, you\u2019re going to need to get some assistance from an attorney.", "Really happy to hear it! I had few passing thoughts about your post and I was rooting for you!", "Can you believe it? A first, for Reddit!", "Talking shit out: the true superpower.", "Op is not in the US and clarified in the original post that in her country what is hers before marriage keeps being hers after.", "For the husbands sake too tbh. Property tax, insurance, improvements, and repairs are OPs problem.", "OP is not in the U.S., and from the sound of things lives in a country where marital property is never automatically commingled.", "We did it, Reddit.", "Fair point."]}
