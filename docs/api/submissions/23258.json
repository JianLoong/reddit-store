I don't think you're an arsehole for being honest about the mental and emotional toll it's taking on you but you should've chosen your words better. Your girlfriend can't help being upset at what she heard. I'm going to say NAH because neither of you are arseholes, you're both just going through a really difficult time. I hope things pick up for the both of you xxx", "NAH.\n\nMental heath issues also affect the people around them. Yes it was probably the wrong way to say it, but you are suffering mentally too.", "NAH - she can't help it, and it's impacting you negatively. \n\nIf you're planning to stay long-term, I recommend reading *When Someone You Love is Depressed: How to Help Your Loved One Without Losing Yourself* and *Helping Others with Depression: Words to Say, Things to Do.* There are also support groups for people with loved ones who have depression that might help ease the load, at least by talking with other people who get it.", "As someone who deals with a lot of mental health problems and trauma, I often feel bad for my boyfriend who has to hear about all the time, every damn day. He consoles me and tells me has no problem with it, but I know that can be taxing at times, to be expected to be your partners\u2019 helper all the time (I don\u2019t expect this of him, but I\u2019m sure he does, just like OP probably thinks that way for his girlfriend, no one wants to see their partner hurt)\n\nAlthough I will say, it wasn\u2019t the best choice of words, she was probably already having lots of thoughts about that already and you confirmed it, making her feel like a burden. I would recommend apologizing and communicating how it all makes you feel in a gentler way, and maybe suggesting some things she can do to cope/get these thoughts out of the way without leaning on you so much, she could take up journaling, art, seeing a therapist if y\u2019all can afford it, etc.", "NTA . Everyone else will downvote this though because it comes off as unkind . I say this because I had a boyfriend tell me this once, and it was  at that point that I got help for my depression.  It was also at that point that I realized I was an absolute drag to be around. Yes she may be depressed and need kindness and love , but you are also unhappy being with a depressed person.  If she\u2019s an emotional vampire, she needs to know so she can be conscious of her effect on others.  I sound so cruel when I say this, but as someone who suffers from chronic depression and a mood disorder, I have learned that the real world wants nothing to do with my issues!  Its my obligation to do something about it if I want to maintain healthy relationships.", "NTA. Depression is hard both for those who have it, and those close to them. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to have your own feelings. Maybe they need more help managing/treating their depression. If they aren\u2019t working to address it, sometimes someone close sharing how it\u2019s affecting them can nudge action. \n\nI hope you both get some help.  You don\u2019t have to go through this alone.", "NTA I know how it feels from both points of view, I've been there. What you said most likely hurt her and she feels bad that her depression is affecting you too, but you have a right to feel that way and be open about it. The best thing for both of you would be therapy, maybe even couples therapy. Its not easy situation to be in but I wish you two get through it <3", "\u201cIm tired of your depression\u201d is not a productive comment and is not going to illicit a productive response from someone who\u2019s in the middle of a depressive funk. you could approach it in a more sympathetic way and acknowledge the effect it has on her and how you know thats not the \u201ctrue\u201d version of themselves. idk. i think acknowledging that you know the depressive funks aren\u2019t representative of who your partner is as a whole would be nice to hear so she knows you dont think that SHE is a burden, if that makes sense? Find a way to talk about the depression and its effects without sounding like you are the biggest victim (but definitely acknowledge the tolls it can have on you, kindly) and also let her know the things you love about her & you\u2019re here for her and you wanna figure out how to best support her during these times while also not exhausting yourself. I do struggle w depression & i think the way you approached it was asshole-y, but i know where you are coming from and hope you can circle back with your partner and have a healthy conversation about it. im not gonna fully declare you an asshole because i think/hope you have good intentions", "NTA\n\nI have very severe chronic illnesses.

You're a human too and you don't have to just endlessly cope with things. \n\nMost people will disagree with me I'm sure, but you can love and support your gf but also be tired of it as well.", "NTA. Being with a depressed partner is exhausting and difficult. Of course she doesn\u2019t want to be depressed and you probably should have worded your feelings better but I get the sentiment.", "NTA, assuming you were reasonably kind in the delivery.\n\nPeople with depression turn into black holes, and being around them is like hovering around a black hole. Her mental state might not be her fault, but it\u2019s still her responsibility. Depressed people can be quite selfish and absorbing all joy and energy. They can\u2019t help it, but it\u2019s still extremely selfish. She\u2019s causing you pain. You shouldn\u2019t have to tip toe around her.\n\nThis is all assuming you were reasonably kind in your delivery.", "NTA. It is important that you are honest about your feelings. If you pretend that everything is great when you are actually unhappy, you will end up depressed too. While it is not your girlfriend's fault that she has depression, she is responsible for finding a way out of it and that is not a shared responsibility. Unfortunately mental illness can put a intolerable strain on relationships for this reason.", "You may not have worded it very well, and you seem to realise that. Being in another country, the two of you ARE one another's support structure. Sit down and have a  white-flag discussion about it (have a calm rational discussion, whoever is holding the \"flag\" gets to speak without interruption until they 'hand' it over)", "NTA , one of the things I learned about healthy relationships w depression is that there needs to be space for the non depressed person to feel. if it\u2019s sad, burnt out  etc. it can\u2019t be make it  about my depression . I hope you can express your feelings and be heard.", "NTA. It's depressing to be with someone who's depressed.", "NTA.  It is hard to be in a relationship with someone who suffers from depression.  You need to be honest with yourself and her.  Especially after a move which can be disorienting and isolating for both.  Remember you are in a relationship and obviously love and care for each other, but you are also individuals and need to care for yourselves as well.  Make time to fill your own bucket.", "You could've worded it a lot better.", "It seems to me NAH. I have been the depressed gf to my supportive gf, and I broke up with her because of this (also we were long distance). In retrospect, it has been miserable for me but she has a great partner now so I have conflicted feelings lol. \n\nDoes your girlfriend get professional help? If not, then you are NTA. If she does, then NAH. Depression is hard and it alters your brain and thought process. So, do not be too forceful trying to make her understand your view. Logic sometimes means nothing during depression. I feel for both of you and I hope you two can work it out \u2661", "You phrased it badly but NTA it is draining to live with some dealing with depression especially if they\u2019re not doing anything about it which she may or may not be", "A pleasantly surprising amount of NTAs", "NTA u r just emotionally drained. I don\u2019t know how u do it but I won\u2019t be able to. Hanging around someone who is depressed (and not by their choice) would also affect me mentally and I will go in a downward spiral. It\u2019s ok to be down once in awhile but I won\u2019t be able to accept a partner who is clinically depressed cause I am not equipped to deal with it. \n\nI have seen one friend gone from being emotionally stable to needing a therapist because her bf was clinically depressed and eventually took his own life. His depression rub of her as well. Currently she is with a happy go lucky optimistic dude and has become almost like her original self. \n\nSo unless it\u2019s a family member I won\u2019t choose to have a romantic relationship with a clinically depressed person .", "YTA\n\ntelling someone you\u2019re tired of their depression literally adds nothing. don\u2019t you think she\u2019s tired of her depression too? she doesn\u2019t wanna be depressed. you could maybe start focusing conversations towards things that might be adding to the depression. when i moved to another country, the cultural shock was a lot and it\u2019s not something to be taken lightly.\n\nyou probs both should go to therapy and learn better communication skills.", "My husband had mayor depression for years before healing. I was exhausting and tired of this, but he understood. It was not about guild tripping him, but my feelings were valid. NTA.", "YTA. How helpful do you think that comment was, actually?\n\nOf course, no one is saying you can't express your feelings and express how her depression affects you, in a productive and meaningful conversation, but putting it in those words makes YTA.", "NTA. While it may sound cruel, living with someone who is severely depressed, can be very, very tough. And sometimes speaking up about how it makes you feel, can be precisely what is necessary for the other to seek help. Just be careful in choosing the right words.", "NTA. Insensitive? Yes. But as someone who has depressed friends frequently come to talk about whatever happens to be upsetting them today isn't fun. It's mentally draining and not fun to talk to that person when 90% of your conversations are about how unhappy they are.", "NTA\n\nJust tell her you are sorry you worded it poorly. Being tired of her illness is not the same as being tired of her as a person. If she wants, she will understand, bc i'm sure she is tired of her illness too. \n\nDoes she get help for her depression?", "NTA. Depression is an illness--  just as addiction is an illness-- that takes a toll on the family and friends of the ill.  Only the one suffering from the illness can be the one to take matters into their own hands by seeking and accepting help.  Until they do,  everyone that chooses to be around them pays the mentally exhausting price.", "A gentle YTA. \n\nYes, it is exhausting. Yes, it does wear on you. However, she is suffering much more and being told that her depression is a burden on other people could have compounding effects that you can't even anticipate. \n\nI've struggled with suicidal ideation despite generally being a very positive person because I was told that my mental health struggles made life worse for people I loved. I know you don't want that for her. \n\nI suggest that you apologize for the way you say said it, explain that you don't want her to feel like a burden, and try to make a plan for the two of you to each get individual mental and social help/support while finding time to do things as a couple that don't involve mental health. \n\nA major part of this is going to be helping her find and cultivate a support network outside of you. It is very tiring to shoulder a persons entire mental health weight alone. You cannot be an entire network for a person. She needs to have a therapist of her own, she needs to have friends of her own, which means seeking out Things to do in this new place you live in.", "I\u2019d say NTA, but only because of one special circumstance in your case: having recently moved to another country, you probably don\u2019t have anyone or anywhere else to vent. In all other cases you should never, ever, not ever say something like this to your depressed partner, unless you don\u2019t give a sh!t about them anymore and even then it is selfish, abject and cruel. Whatever feelings you have, go and vent them somewhere else. You cannot imagine what depression is like and to be told that you are a burden to others may well bring depressed people to do irreversible things to themselves.\n\nD O  N O T  E V E R  S A Y  T H A T  Y O U  A R E  T I R E D  O F  T H E I R  D E P R E S S I O N  T O  A  D E P R E S S E D  P E R S O N\n\nHonestly, for all the cruel, nasty, mean things my ex did to me I hate her the most for her telling me regularly what a burden to her my depression was.", "NTA. Having someone in constant depression puts your life in a major slump. Nothing is good enough. Everything is wrong.... It's something that maybe you try not to let things get to you but you have someone crying next to you.", "Your choice of words is terrible if that's what you said to her.", "Yes. \n\nYTA for how you said how you feel.\n\nYou KNOW she has depression and you say something that would make her even more depressed... Not hard to come to my conclusion.\n\nMoving on from that you can rectify that by apologising to her about the way you said how her depression affects you also. This may become either a breakthrough for you both or an inevitable break-up. \n\nI'd approach things very cautiously, respectfully and with an open mind.\n\nOpen up the dialogue to talk about this further where you both can feel safe to share what's going on with the mental load that you are both now dealing with in your relationship. You evidently need to state what's going on with you internally before you snap again. \n\nI'd then advise couples therapy because a professional who deals with issues like this all the time will be far better equipped than both of you are at tackling this problem.", "Such a neurotypical statement. It's  hard to watch someone in the midst of a major depression, but it's  harder to experience  it first hand. Your brain tells you that it will never change. Depression makes you feel as if things will never get better either. \n\nYou chose your words poorly and have added to her sadness and feelings of being an awful person. \n\nI'm going to go with a soft NTA. I  hope it was just an example of you mis -speaking.", "NTA however In the past, I'd probably say YTA loud and proud, but... as someone who struggles with depression, I've seen first hand how it can bring down the people around me. It IS draining, for both her and you. While maybe the way you said it isn't a very nice way to go about it, you're not a therapist and it's not your job to make her feel better.\n\nI've also been in your position with a friend, every time they talked to me it was about their struggling with depression, substance abuse, self harm. After finally getting myself out of a horrible depressive rut, it was hard to listen to him constantly come to me about things like that and it brought me down so bad. I eventually had to tell him that I cannot help him, I am not his therapist, he refused to get help and at the end of the day, I told him that if he doesn't get the help he needs I can no longer be friends with him as it's causing my mental health to decline again having to listen to his self harming stories.. he'd even go as far as to send me pictures of his scars!\n\nYou're NTA. Your mental health is important too, you should gently ask her to find a professional to talk to about it.\n\nEdit to add the NTA in front lol.", "I can understand you, but sadly, YTA.\n\nIf you feel tired of it, imagine how she feels. Your feelings are valid, but I am afraid that was a poor choice of words. I doubt she even needed to hear it at all. Again, I understand your feelings, depression seems like a never ending cycle, and you are completely entitled to tiredness. But, maybe next time try talking about your frustration with a friend. \n\nAs someone who is depressed, this illness can be terrible isolating. You can be surrounded by people and think no-one cares. Your complain only gives her another reason to doubt, another reason to believe she is alone, even if you do care a lot! \n\nIf you love her, support her. It might help to explain your words, and try to include her feelings in the conversation. Something like \"It frustrates me to see you suffer because I love you and I want you to get better\". Depression is a long journey, and you are in it with her. Take care of yourselves.", "NTA you\u2019re not blaming her. However she needs counseling and medication. If she doesn\u2019t do this, dump her.", "YTA. She's probably tired of being depressed as well. She needs your support and you're incapable of giving any.", "NTA. You are not obliged to deal with someone\u2019s mental illness. She has to help herself too. She also has to see that it\u2019s hard on you too. Hust because you aren\u2019t depressed doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be tired of someone else\u2019s depression if it affects you every single day.", "NTA for feeling tired of it.  It's very difficult to have that around you all the time. But you need to be patient and find out what specifically you can DO to make her life easier.  Going to another country is a huge transition and it takes a long time for some people to feel 'at home ' and build up friend networks. She needs more support than you can give her,  both in terms of therapy and having others who will accept her as she is. You both need to build up your support groups.", "Yeah, you said exactly the wrong thing. Sorry, YTA.", "NTA, as long as you approached it gently. Mental illness is no one\u2019s fault, but it\u2019s hard on everyone. A huge motivator in trying to relieve my depression and anxiety, is to be the best I can be for my partner. Would strongly suggest counselling for you both, and support from family and friends, if any of those things are attainable for you.", "NTA, but could be handled better. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being emotionally drained by someone who suffers with depression, it is extremely difficult.\n\nBut she is hurt, I'm sure it is one big misunderstanding. You did the right thing in being honest, though it could have been handled differently. \nSit her down, tell her yes, it is frustrating for you as well but also that you will be there for her and help her fight through it (of course, if that is what you want to do).\n\nI suffer with PTSD and depression and I know for sure as day I annoy the living hell out of my partner because of it, but I need him to understand that some days can't be 50/50, some days I need him to do 80/20 and I will do the same for them obviously.", "NTA. While I am sympathetic to what your girlfriend is experiencing, it is part of your life experience too. It is exhausting to deal with someone else\u2019s mental health.", "NTA, but I hope where you are good counseling is available for BOTH of you. She obviously needs a bit of therapy, and talking to someone would help you handle things better as well. \n\nIs it the move, perhaps homesickness or culture shock that is hard for her?", "NTA, it\u2019s mentally draining living with a depressed person", "Nta. I have depression and I told my boyfriend before we got together about it and that I have chronic illnesses that will also get worse. He still wanted to be with me so we\u2019ve been together now for 8years. I have given him outs over the years because I am getting worse and I know it takes a big toll on healthy significant others. I have conversations with him to help him when/if needed and he\u2019s always told me \u201cyour stuck with me for better or worse\u201d. \n\nJust wait and speak to her asking if you could talk because as partners you two share the load - emotionally and mentally. A team is together so when one feels one way the other worries as well because they know something is wrong. How could you not be hurting in your own way when someone you care for is struggling. You feel for them and that\u2019s alright that it\u2019s tiring you too. Stay strong <3", "You're NTA.   I know how you feel, and it's fucking rough.  It's really hard to always be the strong supportive one, and it's hellish trying to keep the feelings bottled up as you watch your partner go through that shit.   \n\nYour timing and delivery sucked ass and needs work.    But you're not an asshole for feeling that way.", "Are you a fool? You\u2019re tired of dealing with it? You should try living every minute of your life with it. Having to fight to want to stay alive and to complete basic tasks. YTA", "I\u2019m struggling with depression myself and I can understand where are you coming from. I had to downgrade my relationship with close friends of mine to regular friends in this period, because it was hard on them and I totally respected that. I got sad and even cried sometimes but I did get it. Because they are human beings too and they have their own problems. Not struggling with depression not automatically means they\u2019re stress-free. But your choice of words a bit hursh. I understand you\u2019ve been patient for a long time and kind of vented your feelings to your gf. But you did not explain yourself just pointed out your problem which\u2019s primary cause was your gf. But she can do nothing about it and probably felt guilty and abandoned. I suggest you speak with your gf with more sympathy. For example you can make sure that she doesn\u2019t think that you blame her for nothing by saying things like \u201cI was with you this whole time and I will be when you need my support and encouragement, but I\u2019m struggling with things too and i need you, I want to share them with you \u2026\u201d etc. All you guys need is clearly express your feelings, no blaming, no judgement, no hostility just plain truth. I\u2019ll go with NTA here, but you can be the A H based on your choices further on.", "You have a legit problem. But generally, you want to go to someone further away from a problem than you are for support, not to someone closer to the problem. So you no doubt need to talk about practical solutions with your girlfriend, but to complain about how hard her illness is on you, pick someone else. Go to some other source for support and validation then come back to her with ideas for ways to improve the situation.", "NTA, but the way you said it made you sound like one", "NTA. I think the spirit of what you were saying was valid and understandable. I'd just encourage you to choose your words in a more thoughtful/intentional way moving forward.  It's easy to perceive a more hurtful message when it's communicated poorly.", "YTA - there are ways to say that you are being impacted by her depression that aren't this. You can absolutely have this sort of conversation, but you have to approach it with some compassion! If you're tired of it, imagine how tired of it she is, she's the one who has to deal with it  literally all the time.\n\nAsk what you can do to help her help herself, find things that are within your limits and do those things, but help yourself too. Find something that you can do by yourself that brings you joy and helps your mood overall. Find friends who are supportive that you can talk to. Do things to make your own life better. You could also break up if this is really too much for you. But don't be an AH about it.", "\u2728YTA\u2728 Depression isn\u2019t something you can just switch on and off. So making her feel bad while she already feels bad will just make it worse. \nYou could have been kinder about your feelings because the way you came across was **destructive instead of constructive**. \nI will say though I understand your feelings, I grew up with a mother that suffered severe depression to the point of neglecting her children. You have every right to feel burdened by someone else\u2019s mental health. But coming across apathetic will not get you great results.", "YTA. If she could stop being depressed, she would.

You aren't married and if you feel like you don't want to live the rest of your life with a depressed partner, you're entitled to leave the relationship.

You can't help that. You don't owe it to anyone to choose a partner with a condition you can't handle. Your girlfriend would also be better off with someone who is more compassionate and willing to make allowances for her mental health issues.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with deciding this issue is a deal-breaker. There's no point in wasting your girlfriend's time, if you are just going to be miserable living with her. That's not a good situation for her, either.

I wouldn't talk to you either.", "Oh...YTA so much YTA", "You don\u2019t deserve a YTA because mental illness is exhausting. And I say this as an anxious and depressed person and being supportive is exhausting all the time. You deserve to take care of your mental health too. There should not be an obligation on you to take care of her all the time without complaints hell you wouldn\u2019t be a bad person if you choose to walk away.

You need to let her find her way through this and you find a way to deal with it without adding to her emotional load.", "YTA! She is the depressed one, maybe this is even harder for her.

My partner has had a very severe depression, mostly drug resistant, for years. Add to that raising a child.\nBUT, I don\u2019t know how much you about depression and the wording is very important. Very sick people won\u2019t always say what\u2019s in their mind. Suicidal ideation are very frequent with depression, and the wrong thing at the wrong time can trigger very bad things.\nI don\u2019t say that to make you feel guilty. You are entitled to your feeling. But if after this discussion or another of the same type, she were to commit suicide, you would feel guilty for the rest of your life. It would not be your fault, it would be the illness, but if you love her, believe me you wouldn\u2019t make the difference.\n\nYou are allowed to talk about your feelings but my advice would be:\n- to discuss at a moment you are in control of yourself \n- to share honestly but kindly. Those are your feelings, you\u2019re tired about the illness, but you don\u2019t resent the person.\n- maybe you need some space to cope. Have some time each week just for you, to breathe.

Yeah, OP choose their words poorly but I still feel sorry for them because dealing with someone who's going through something like this can be fucking horrific.

It's just as bad, if not worse!\" and you will say \"I'm tired of your egg allergy\" thinking she'll understand it's not a comment on her but the situation that allergy has put you both in. It is a fact, after all. But she will hear blame, \"I'm tired of you and what my life looks like because of you\" while thinking \"I'm the one with the allergy, so how does she get to complain?!\" and then feel guilty that she is making some part of your life suck.\n\nDepression makes things personal in a way they don't have to be, and the guilt/blame tango is a part of the disorder. Sometimes it's just plain silly to even the depressed brain when logic finally gets a say (talk about \"egg on your face\" lol). It may be part of the explanation but it can't be an excuse. Your experience with her depression is just as valid as her experience with her depression, even if it isn't the same experience from the same source. Caretaking and empathy are exhausting, but coexisting with such a state is draining also. \n\nNAH because depression is hard, as well as being in the depression \"splash zone,\" especially if you've helped a person suffering feel safe. In a conversation like the one you referenced (best as one can without details), it might help to say something like \"Major depression really is hard. And it doesn't stay limited to just the person with the diagnosis! I've watched your struggle, and I try to help the best I can, but that's wearing on me, too. So major depression just sucks.\" This way you're communicating what your experience is (it's not all about her and she may not even intend for it to be), actually being able to tell your partner about what your life looks like from the inside, and validating yourself as well. The point you're trying to convey is that it's you and her vs. major depression, and she may need reminders. But it's unrealistic to expect you to be responsible for that reminder every single time; you'll be walking on eggshells and always reacting instead of just living. So please give yourself some grace and take care of yourself (alone time, personal therapy, activities outside of the house, cupcake shop every Wednesday... something just for you). You're someone's safe space, but even doomsday bunkers need refills, maintenance, and respect for what they are.\n\nThank you for being a supportive person in the fight against the stigma associated with mental health.", "You didn't mean to be, but you certainly ended up BTA here. It was your word choice, and knowing she's depressed you should have chosen better. I get it, I'm a depressed person, and my wife has anxiety.

It's very hard for me to hear because it's the nature of my illness to twist those words into blaming myself.  However, I think it's very important for him to feel that his suffering is also seen, so I bear it.  I'm glad I can acknowledge the reality of the situation on both sides, even though it is painful for me.  When he is able to share his experience with me, it keeps us connected.

As someone who has struggled with severe depression I appreciate the empathy everyone has for the gf. \nI was drawing on my own experience. Being the depressed one I now feel guilty for the pain and trauma I caused those I love. I was getting help but it wasn\u2019t enough. When I saw the pain I was causing my family, I checked myself into the hospital. I am stable now. It\u2019s hard watching my children suffer from the same mental illness that I have.

The dynamic is different, but I understand how someone can slip up out of frustration with a partner. I know that a few times my husband and I have both said insensitive things to each other, even though we are still very much in love. (He has mental health issues too). We are very lucky that that we have a lot of support from our extended families. My main point was that the OP is supporting her gf, but no one is supporting her! I thought she deserved a pass this one time. Everyone has different experiences. Obviously, if the gf is suicidal then that would be different. I\u2019m definitely not saying that the gf doesn\u2019t have a reason to feel hurt. She absolutely does. I\u2019d be surprised if she hasn\u2019t lashed out at the OP before.

Her anger and hurt is valid, however, because depressed people are often humiliated by their inability to function well and keenly aware of the effect they're having. They just can't seem to fix it.

I'd say YTA but not because of what you were trying to say, but specifically what you said. I'd say you should apologize to her, take that hit to get her to open up, explain what you meant in better terms, and don't be defensive. Communicate that depression sucks, you sympathize with her, so much in fact that it's not easy for you either.\n\nBut speaking as someone with depression, who prior to his depression has had friends with depression: It's much harder having depression than empathizing with people who do, so keep in the back of your mind that however hard it's on you, it's worse on her.", "Gentle YTA. You said this to her in a very bad way. Apologize and make it clear that you were not trying to suggest that she needs to stop being depressed.", "Awww, I think you might be the asshole.

That is the sort of thing that if someone said it to me, it would pretty much end our relationship. It adds no value and places the blame on her as if she can magically stop being depressed. Which is funny because the very next thing you say is \"I didn't mean she should miraculously stop being depressed.\" Well buddy, how else was she supposed to take it when you said it like she was the problem?You need to apologize hard-core for the way you phrased that and hope she's willing to listen.", "INFO: how recently did you move?

Also, regardless of how long ago you moved, this was never going to be a productive conversation. As someone with depression (& ADHD & anxiety) it's a lot easier for me to have conversations with my partner about specific behaviors. Maybe try picking one aspect of her depression that is really difficult for you to emotionally handle. Like, \"it makes me sad/lonely when you can't join me to hang out with my friends and I wish I could make going out easier for you.\" I understand it can be difficult in the moment though, so only light YTA.

Supporting her gf does not mean OP has to suffer in silence and just take whatever gf gives without feedback, and the gf may not get the help she needs unless she knows it's not just affecting her.

We should all try to be kind but OP is absolutely not required to keep quiet about her own feelings until it's the right time and place for the GF, which may never come, to surface her own feelings.  Just no, NFW, your depression does not mean everyone around you has to cater to your needs while their own go unheard.", "It does not sound worse than OPs statement in any way shape or form. \"I'm tired of your depression\" is an absolute dagger through the heart that places all the blame on her and does nothing to explain how he's feeling beyond the exhaustion, nor does it propose any solution. it is an awful thing to say to someone. what part of \"can we help you find another source of support\" is leaving her on her own?", "Have you lived with someone you love who has depression. \n\nI have, I don\u2019t have it but when my mom and sister need space I give it to them.

Or that it\u2019s what I\u2019m advocating for. \n\nI\u2019ll repeat: If OP can\u2019t do it then she can leave if she wants to. Nothing is stopping her. She can go at any time. She just needs to make sure she\u2019s listening to what her gf is saying she needs to get through things and decide when the best time to talk will be. If it never comes then she shouldn\u2019t keep waiting. \n\nHopefully you never live with someone who has any mental health issues otherwise you may have to respect their illness and love them for who they are. \n\nFor instance. My sister is dealing with a bad bout right now. \n\nI\u2019ve checked in on her. I helped her get groceries and have respected when she asked for some space.

OP is just asking for their emotions to be acknowledged and considered. that should probably come before talking about leaving imo.\n\nthe last part is phrased like a question, but it's a fraud. what if the answer is \"i do mind! i need you now more than ever!\" ? needs are in direct conflict and the speaker has already stated that their own needs come first. loading up on weasel words to 'ask' when you've already made up your mind is just disrespectful.\n\ni think if you strip away the fluff, the main content of the revised message is something along the lines of \"i can't handle being around you any more. i need to go. let's see if we can find a soft landing.\" i find this to be significantly harsher."]}
