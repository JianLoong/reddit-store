I was a baby when they broke up. Dad was around me all the time when I was a baby though. When I was 5 my mom met her husband. They lived about 20 hours from each other and it put a strain on things so about a year later he moved himself and his two kids in with us. A decision was made when they got engaged to move, and even though my dad fought to retain custody of me, and even though he had 50-50 parenting time, my mom was granted permission to move me several hours away. Dad didn't like being away from me so he moved to regain 50-50. Once that happened they used the fact he was less financially stable post-move to get permission to move again. It was really upsetting for 7 year old me. I have always been a daddy's girl and I missed having him around all the time. He was the dad to volunteer with my class, sign up for field trip duty, take time to join me for extra curricular's. He would help me with homework. He'd pick me up from school on his Friday's. That all stopped because he couldn't keep following us and making his financials worse. So I had a long distance plan with him.\n\nBut he never stopped being my dad.\n\nMy mom's husband was not suddenly the number 1 man in my life.\n\nI made sure everyone knew he was not my dad. I made sure to talk about my dad all the time. This led to a strain with my mom and often feeling like she prioritized my stepsiblings and later half siblings, over me.

She said I made sure everyone knew I was not a true part of the family. So I had to live with the fact more would be invested into the kids who respected the whole family.\n\nI am now 21, I'm engaged and my wedding planning is going well. My mom didn't know I was engaged. She found out through another family member. Then she looked at my social media and saw that not only was dad part of planning, but that my future ILs are playing a big role too.

I told her she was not important to me anymore just like I was not important to her when I wouldn't embrace her husband.

He was a single Dad to a 7 year old daughter having lost his wife to cancer. We lived two hours apart but we were both crystal clear from day one that our children were our number one priority. If we wanted to build a relationship we would have to travel back and forth to stay with each other but our children would not be uprooted from their lives, schools, friends and (in my daughter's case) her other parent. Their security and happiness was paramount and, if we wanted to be together, it was on us to do what it took to make it work. Not impose a whole new life on them. \n\nIt is now over a decade later and both our daughter's left for University a couple of months ago. We can now finally live together and are very excited about our new chapter. Our daughters are happy and well adjusted young women who we are very proud of. \n\nYou deserved much better from your Mum and I am so glad that your Dad is so freaking awesome to compensate.

We have always made it clear that we are 1 big family not 2 separate ones. Any man that wanted to be in mine and my kids lives had to except that.\n\nWhat your mum did was incredibly selfish and then when you didn't react how you wanted she became toxic and emotionally abusive. I'm so glad your dad got custody and got away from the environment.\n\nEven if that wasn't the case your wedding is your day. You can invite or exclude who ever you want.\nMy brother hates being center of attention so when he got married literally only the 2 mums were invited, the rest of us were excluded but that's what he needed for HIS perfect day.

She's not interested in you, she's afraid of the loss of face in front of other family members, e.g. the ones that told her you were engaged. This is just an opportunity for her to make something else about herself. \n\nI'm glad you and your dad were able to overcome the roadblocks she threw in front of you both. \n\nEnjoy your special day and if you get to the end of it without having thought about your mother, give yourself an extra pat on the back.", "NTA.
