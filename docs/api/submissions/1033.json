I was a baby when they broke up. Dad was around me all the time when I was a baby though. When I was 5 my mom met her husband. They lived about 20 hours from each other and it put a strain on things so about a year later he moved himself and his two kids in with us. A decision was made when they got engaged to move, and even though my dad fought to retain custody of me, and even though he had 50-50 parenting time, my mom was granted permission to move me several hours away. Dad didn't like being away from me so he moved to regain 50-50. Once that happened they used the fact he was less financially stable post-move to get permission to move again. It was really upsetting for 7 year old me. I have always been a daddy's girl and I missed having him around all the time. He was the dad to volunteer with my class, sign up for field trip duty, take time to join me for extra curricular's. He would help me with homework. He'd pick me up from school on his Friday's. That all stopped because he couldn't keep following us and making his financials worse. So I had a long distance plan with him.\n\nBut he never stopped being my dad.\n\nMy mom's husband was not suddenly the number 1 man in my life.\n\nI made sure everyone knew he was not my dad. I made sure to talk about my dad all the time. This led to a strain with my mom and often feeling like she prioritized my stepsiblings and later half siblings, over me. When I was 14 I asked my dad to fight for custody of me. He won. I then got to have him as my primary parent. A year later I told my mom she made me feel less important than her stepkids and new kids. She told me those were the consequences of my rejecting our family and rejecting the man she loved. She said I made sure everyone knew I was not a true part of the family. So I had to live with the fact more would be invested into the kids who respected the whole family.\n\nI am now 21, I'm engaged and my wedding planning is going well. My mom didn't know I was engaged. She found out through another family member. Then she looked at my social media and saw that not only was dad part of planning, but that my future ILs are playing a big role too. She called to chew me out over it and said I was excluding her from one of the biggest moments of my life and how could I. She also told me I'd hurt her feelings. I called her a hypocrite for that. I told her she rejected my family, she rejected the fact I was not her husband's child and prioritized her other kids over me. I told her she was not important to me anymore just like I was not important to her when I wouldn't embrace her husband. My choice of words set her off and she called me childish for throwing what she said back in her face when that was different, because she never neglected or ignored me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667483225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yl3aw9/aita_for_calling_my_mom_a_hypocrite_and_saying/", "score": 496, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she purposely punished you, a child, for not going along with her selfish wants.  I suspect you are much better off not having her in your life.  The fact that she didn't bother to be in touch with you at all so she didn't know anything about your life says everything to me about her still being a selfish AH.\n\nI hope to hell you aren't inviting her to the wedding.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. These are her consequences and not being at your wedding, being a grandmother to your children should you choose to have any, etc. are her consequences.

NTA and congrats on your engagement!", "Absolutely NTA! \n\nYour Mum's behaviour after meeting her husband was incredibly selfish and, having been in her position, I am genuinely baffled by it. \n\nI was co-parenting my 8 year old daughter with her lovely Dad when I met my current partner. He was a single Dad to a 7 year old daughter having lost his wife to cancer. We lived two hours apart but we were both crystal clear from day one that our children were our number one priority. If we wanted to build a relationship we would have to travel back and forth to stay with each other but our children would not be uprooted from their lives, schools, friends and (in my daughter's case) her other parent. Their security and happiness was paramount and, if we wanted to be together, it was on us to do what it took to make it work. Not impose a whole new life on them. \n\nIt is now over a decade later and both our daughter's left for University a couple of months ago. We can now finally live together and are very excited about our new chapter. Our daughters are happy and well adjusted young women who we are very proud of. \n\nYou deserved much better from your Mum and I am so glad that your Dad is so freaking awesome to compensate. You have a good one there! And now you have a wonderful life with your soon to be husband to look forward to. Good luck and wishing you every happiness.", "OP gets it.

I wouldn't want anything to do with her after what she did.", "NTA, your mom is a hypocritical jerk. I'd go NC from now on after how terrible she treated you.", "NTA. \n\nShe did her darnedest to alienate and take you away from your father, abused the family court system in doing so, and then neglected you when she got her way. She's cruel,manipulative, spiteful, and  selfish.. and she sees nothing wrong with what she is. Gross.\n\nWhat decent, loving mother would do such a thing? Spoiler, no decent parent would.", "NTA and block your mom and step people from everything now. Maybe if it\u2019s in the budget hire security for the ceremony and party. Just so they can\u2019t ruin your day. Congrats on the wedding.", "She did neglect you though. She neglected your needs when she moved you repeatedly from a loving father. She neglected your needs when she tried to alienate him. She neglected your needs when she took offence that you wanted him in your life and punished you for not embracing the whole family - whatever that means. And now she is experiencing that thing called consequences. NTA.", "Also she can always dominate her other kids' weddings, so you're not depriving her of anything.
