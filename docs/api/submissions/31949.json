Did you finish HS early? Next, if you were in fact a nurse (which I highly doubt given the information you\u2019ve provided), you\u2019d know that pregnancy hormones and the nausea that comes with it, isn\u2019t a joke.. and just because most days she\u2019s better in 10-20mins, doesn\u2019t mean that today she didn\u2019t have it extra bad (because that happens a lot with morning sickness\u2014and can last the entirety of the pregnancy). Additionally, she will *always* be considered high risk, due to her age and medical history (which is why I doubt you\u2019re actually a nurse, as any licensed nurse would know such). She\u2019s considered geriatric, and her ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages would mean that she would remain high risk her whole pregnancy. \nTo be fair though, you\u2019re just a kid yourself, so I\u2019m sure when you thought to make up this story, it sounded good in your head\u2026 but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t add up. \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly. And all over a tradition which is not that important! OP could get an ornament on her own or skip getting an ornament this year and dad/stepmom could get theirs when it was convenient for them. This isn\u2019t a life or death situation and certainly doesn\u2019t warrant horrible treatment like this", "Some places have accelerated programs and jump start programs for college classes while in high school, maybe OP did that", ">but you need to be working less hours for your own health and sanity.\n\nWorking in the medical field do have crazy hours and we have no idea if this is her employer's requirement or not.  And if it's voluntary, maybe OP is working these crazy hours to pay off a huge bill or maybe wants to put a substantial amount down towards a house/condo.  I knew a acquaintance who did this, her original job was for a major store but she had to take a part time job at a major home improvement store because her Ex husband left her with a (unknowingly) HUGE IRS bill when they were married (and you know the IRS will get their money out of stone if they have too).  She worked that her full time job 8-10 hours/5 days and the part time 4-6 hours/5 days (which included the weekends).  She was exhausted mentally and physically but she told me she had to do it because she couldn't afford paying the lowest amount the IRS allowed out of her primary paychecks and still pay her bills.  It took her 3 years and she is finally done but she did quit her primary job and went full time with the home improvement store because of the benefits, pay and advancement."]}
