It\u2019s a nicer place, sort of expensive, and I like his parents so I\u2019d have the chance to come say hi. \n\nHowever, I absolutely hate serving people I know, especially when they use it as an excuse to \u201csee me\u201d. If you wanted to see me so bad why not plan a dinner for a time I\u2019m off work? It\u2019s kinda demeaning and just awkward.\n\nSo I told him that they\u2019re welcome to show up, it\u2019s a public place, but please don\u2019t specifically ask for me. If I\u2019m up in the rotation, great. But if not, I\u2019ll come say hi during the night. I get to work and see the reservation, with my name in the notes, specifically to be in my section. I ask the host to just put them anywhere else, and was a little annoyed that they ended up blatantly going against what I was pretty much begging them to not do. \nThe host ended up telling them that I wasn\u2019t there/was cut when they again specifically asked for me upon arrival, which was kinda dumb to lie and not tell the truth, considering I was obviously working and my section was full regardless. \n\nFor context, the last time I saw his parents was at a dinner shortly before he broke up with me pretty harshly. Recently though, it\u2019s a complete 180 after he told me he realized stuff and wants to be with me and to give us another shot. It kinda feels like I\u2019m being love bombed by him sometimes, he\u2019s telling me he loves me when I can\u2019t say it back and mean it, is obsessed with me, wants me to meet his entire family, when just a few months ago told me he could never commit or see himself dating anyone. I\u2019m honestly still Hurting from the breakup and am kinda confused as to why he\u2019s changed so much so quickly. I just couldn\u2019t handle serving his family and pretending like everything is fine and prefect from my perspective. \n\nAnyway, it was super busy and I barely had time to serve my own tables, let alone a water break or stopping to chat. We are also not allowed to have our phones while on the clock, they\u2019re in the back room on silent. So I finally get a minute after 4 hours of complete chaos to check my phone, and see texts from him saying that His parents hate me now cause I didn\u2019t say hi, I wasn\u2019t their server, and he now wants nothing to do with me, along with accusing me of sleeping with my coworker. I get a drink after my shift and he then tries to call me 5+ times. I eventually pick up and he goes on to say I\u2019m a horrible human being, I have a pattern of cheating (again accusing me of sleeping with a coworker I\u2019ve never even hungout with 1on1), I\u2019ve been lying to him for weeks, I don\u2019t have the basic decency to just say hi, and then told me to go fuck myself.  He then blocked me on several platforms. \n\nI didn\u2019t think what I did was so bad, but his reaction has me second guessing everything. Should I have just sucked it up and served them?

His reaction to you working while at work, rather than catering to his demands, tells you everything you need to know.\n\nHe's a complete asshole, and while you seem smart and confident enough to not need this advice, I'm going to give it anyway:  make sure you never make the mistake of getting back together with him.  His Jekyll-and-Hyde attitude (I don't want to date...no, I want to get back together.....you're a horrible human being!) is just going to continue and it's best if it doesn't involve you.  He absolutely will try and contact you again, shut him down immediately when he does.", "NTA - Let me get this straight. So he goes for a fancy dinner with his parents where you work. You set a clear boundary that you don't want to serve his table because you don't like serving people you know (fair enough, don't mix business and personal life).\n\nThen he books, specifically asking for you, and when he doesn't get his way he starts calling you a bad person, because he ignored your boundaries.\n\nYou're not the red flag here, he is.", "NTA. You had a job to do and had told him I'm advance how you felt about serving people you know.\nSuggesting they come to your restaurant was a bad decision though...\n\nHonestly, it sounds like this all worked out in your favor though. He showed you his true colors. He doesn't sound like a guy you should take back, so him blocking you it's for the best. Hurry up and block him back.", "NTA. He sounds derranged. You are better off without him. Block him on everything.", "NTA but, don\u2019t get back together yet again with this guy.   \n\nYou had told him not to ask for you, and likely explained why it\u2019s awkward to serve people you know etc, and he blew through that, and also blew up your phone while you were working when he likely knows it\u2019s not even on you.  Then accuses you of cheating etc.\n\nThis guy is totally not worth your time.  I had to recheck ages, he sounds like he\u2019s a teenager.", "NTA - and you dodged a bullet. Celebrate. He showed his true colors (and his parents too)", "NTA. Not sure why you would encourage them to come to your restaurant though. Seems a recipe for disaster.\n\nYou wouldn't have been TA if you had purposely ignored them. You two aren't together. Cut off the communication, move on, and gain closure.", "NTA, dodged a bullet.", "NTA, but boy, your ex and his family sure are.", "NTA\n\nYou must be from the Matrix because you dodged an entire salvo of bullets!", "NTA.  Your ex did you the favor of showing you his true character this evening, which hopefully put to rest any notion of getting back together with him.", "NTA\u2026he\u2019s just a b****. They could\u2019ve easily approached you and said hello\u2026pretty sure they noticed you were busy. You are not obliged to go out of your way to appease others especially when they\u2019ve hurt you. I made this mistake in the past and it\u2019s not you\u2026it\u2019s seriously them. Don\u2019t let this get to you!", "NTA - Honestly it sounds like he just wanted to see you have to serve his family like an actual servant. It's weird. He also sounds unstable. Move on from this guy and find someone who can respect boundaries and who has common sense when it comes to dating.", "NTA and get away while you can , and keep records of all communications , just in case", "NTA and this guy is a lutanic. Be glad it's over and DONT try it again.", "NTA\n\n When I'm in service mode the last thing I want to be serving at a table of guests when I know  them personally as I'm tbh very fake and different, most notably I amplify my accent to sound like I have a more broad accent (Australian Accent) as it got me more tips\n\nHonestly looks like you dodged a hail of bullets with that breakup though.", "NTA, garbage took itself out.", "NTA. He's your ex, and how you arrange your work has nothing to do with him. It probably wasn't the best move to suggest your restaurant though. \n\nThis possessive hot/cold behaviour is a big red flag. It might be wise to just cut all contact with him.", ">He then blocked me on several platforms.\n\nWell, that was nice of him to save you the trouble.\n\nNo, NTA, he is being controlling and manipulative. He just can't stand to see you living your life without him.", "NTA. Maybe you should not have suggested they come to your workplace if you didn\u2019t want to serve them though", "NTA but seriously stop talking to him", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend must be a participant of r/AITA, where every perceived injustice should be met with ending relationships.", "Please trust your gut feeling that he is love bombing you. The complete turnaround from \u201cI love you so much and want to be together forever\u201d to \u201cI hate you so much, you cheating whore, go die in a ditch\u201d is a GIANT red flag he is proudly waving. NTA.", "Dodged a bullet there. Your instincts were telling you to hold off giving this guy another chance and it paid off. \n\nHe's for sure gonna come groveling back - block his ass!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Don't trust him what he said about his parents He is unreliable narator. RUN! He is dangerous.", "NTA and good riddance. Block him back and never contact him again because those red flags from him are so big they could be used in several \"your mama so big\" jokes. Someone who would have really changed his behaviour to better would never get offended just because you don't have time to come chat at work. He is love bombing you only because now he realizes he has to be alone when no sensible woman will date him due to the red flags so now he just wants you back because you already were together once so he thinks you're stupid enough to get back together. You deserve way better so pay no mind to him and find a new boyfriend. When he is that jealous when you're not together, it will only get worse if you go back to him.", "Sounds like you've had a lucky escape to be honest. this guy seems angry and controlling. Read what you have written here and ask yourself if you would really want a relationship like this for one of your friends. I wouldn't. NTA.", "NTA Time to block him and go no contact. He's obsessed with you - no response of any kind is the only safe response to give such people.", "NTA. He definitely doesn't \"\"love you\"\" in an appropriate way if he's this controlling when you're not even in a relationship. He's trying to get you back by love bombing you and now getting aggressive because you didn't do such a minor thing hoping that you'll crawl back to him. I say block him and good riddance.", "Why did you mention the idea of them going to the restaurant you work at knowing you\u2019ll be slammed and that you don\u2019t want them at one of your tables?", "NTA he probably broke up to have a fling and when that didn\u2019t work out he wanted you back. Good thing you didn\u2019t go back because if he acts like this now he\u2019ll be worse with you. You owe him and his parents nothing. You\u2019re Exes for a reason.", "NTA, in fact, you need to steer clear of that family.", "NTA\n\nHe's your ex. Nobody cares what he thinks, or what he wants anymore.", "Oh, honey. NTA. This man is incredibly toxic. He has hurt you, demeaned you, and tried to insinuate things about you that didn\u2019t happen. He doesn\u2019t listen to you or respect you. \n\nPlease, PLEASE, do not get back together with this man. You deserve better.", "NTA", "NTA. Now you know why this guy is wrong for you!", "ESH but he is way way worse \n\nYou clearly set very unrealistic expectations by suggesting they come to your place of work and indicating that you\u2019d interact with them if so. I can imagine if his parents were excited to see you and then were completely blown off that it would not reflect well. You\u2019re also establishing that he is not a priority to you in a setting where he\u2019s with his parents, has probably talked up the evening and seeing you again, etc. It\u2019s very understandable for him to be put off by how you handled it. \n\nThat said, obviously his reaction was wildly uncalled for and completely over the top. There is no question who the larger asshole is and it\u2019s not even close. Just saying the presence of an objectively worse asshole isn\u2019t full absolution for things you could have handled better as well.", "Gentle esh?\nHe is obviously a bit unhinged and probably a massive asshole. \n\nYou suggest him and his parents coming to the resteraunt you work in, but you hate serving family and friends? Seems like a misplay. I can see how they would expect to see you there. Also, when they made the request for you as a server, they were probably met by someone saying it will be no problem. So it probably did feel like you were avoiding them.\n\nIf they'd been chill and polite then I'd argue that yta. However he pretty majorly shifts the baseline for being an asshole to far above where you are so I definitely wouldn't feel bad", "ESH. Your ex clearly has issues and his response to not having you serve his family is unhinged. But you shouldn\u2019t have invited him and his family to your workplace if you don\u2019t feel comfortable serving them. Or even at least say hello to his parents like you mentioned was your original intention. Just cut the cord already and leave your ex in the past. He\u2019s not the sort of ex that you can be friends with after breakup.", "ESH. Them for very very obvious and much more severe reasons, but a small bit to you as you should have never suggested them come if you didn't want the table. That's like telling someone to poop in your bathroom, but they're not allowed to use the toilet, and you wonder why there is crap in the sink.", "YTA - you suggested the place you work and then tell us you hate when you have to serve people you know?     \n     \nUh, well, uh, what did you expect to happen?     \nYou all suck but you set this whole thing in motion so it's largely on you.", "ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
