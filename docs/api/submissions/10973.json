Medical school and life is stressful enough without loved ones adding to the mix. I don\u2019t think you can really speak to your parents about this, so you may have to ask them to leave.

I'm sure theyll be wildly offended but thats ok. Hopefully they'll disown you for a year which will give you time for a good college experience. If that's not enough ask for a disownment extension and see how it goes. Your other option is to move into student accommodations for now so they can't follow you.", "NTA, its time to be an adult and get some distance from your parents.

But you need to decide what you want your life to be: what your parents dictate for you? Or your own?

I am a doctor, I\u2019m happy, and I\u2019m a better medical provider for having experiences outside the narrow ones my parents wanted me to have. If you want to take care of others well, you need to understand others well. And that means not being closeted away, only studying and never interacting with the world. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you can talk to your sister or someone at university to help you with this, but I suggest that you do that if you can. Then when you talk to your parents it might be best to keep the focus on how they\u2019re interfering with your studies. I\u2019m concerned that your sister needed protection.

However, if you \"love my family dearly, I'm middle eastern & family is so important to me\", you may want to consider to do it gently.

You can make your own decisions regarding your studies, activities, what you wear, and even if you continue to worship the way your parents do.  Tell your parents that they need to let you grow up, that you are in Scotland and you need to make your way in this country.  They need to trust that they have raised you the way they wanted to, and that you are now an adult and need to make decisions for yourself.  \n\nThen stick up for yourself.  If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll find yourself in an arranged marriage, possibly in your parents homeland, likely to a man who gives you even less freedom.", "NTA - is it possible to talk to your landlord about changing locks?", "NAH, No you would not be.  For all of the reasons you said, except for smoking and drinking.  You shouldn't do that no matter who is watching.", "NTA. However, you may be leaving out important information. There are some countries in which an unmarried young adult lady doesn't have real rights. For example. If you call the Police to help evict them, the Police will just laugh at you. Or if you ask them to leave, they will refuse to and due to social stigma, you can't really lock them out of the house since they will cause a huge scene and you will be embarrassed.
