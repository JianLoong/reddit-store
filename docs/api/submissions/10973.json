I have lived in my own flat the entire time. The catch is, my mum has moved with me & my dad visits regularly. They have their own home in the city I am originally from, so it is not like I would leave no place to go - I would never do that.\n\nAn important thing to note is that my university is free - the government pays for its citizens to attend university and we don't have to pay it back.\n\nWhen my sister lived away at uni, she got married in secret and I think this is what has caused my parents to be this strict with me.\n\nI pay the rent, utilities and groceries myself- pretty much everything you could think of. I have a well-paying job in the hospital on campus that allows me to do so although I often work 12 hour night shifts.\n\nI love my family dearly, I'm middle eastern & family is so important to me but I have started to reach my limit. I want to have my own independence without feeling like I have someone breathing down my neck. They are the loveliest people I know but it's gotten too much now.\n\nI am a very bubbly person who loves having so much fun, meeting new people & having wild but wholesome nights with friends & just make the best memories.\n\nI have never had the university experience which is something I want because you're only here once, my social life has taken a huge hit and I've not been able to meet people outside of my course because they are strict about who I hang out with and want me to spend 8+ hours a day studying. I want to grow & learn as a person but I can't do that while my mum lives here & my dad visiting constantly.\n\nI cannot wear what I want, I was told not to make friends & only speak to people regarding my studies, I cannot come & go as I please, if I want to drink or smoke I have to do it secretly, what I eat is controlled (snacks are hidden from me), I cannot pick up hobbies because they will take time away from my education, I cannot do spontaneous things like go on a trip with friends for a weekend. Everything is so controlled.\n\nI feel like this had really messed with my mental health as my life is on repeat & all I do is study, go to uni or stay in my room.\n\nI want to grow and learn as a person but I can't do that while my mum lives here and my dad visiting constantly. Even things like learning new recipes and household skills are things I want to experience. I want to be able to have routines solely focused on myself & making me feel good. I am missing out on so much & would like to have these life experiences but I don't know how to approach this situation with my parents.\n\nMy entire life is dedicated to other people. I study to learn how to take care of my patients, I work as an auxiliary nurse and I am there for people in their most vulnerable moments, I volunteer for a suicide helpline, I give free tuition in science-based subjects, and advice to medical school applicants from a disadvantaged background, I'm the friend everyone goes to every time there is an emergency or life crisis. I love what I do but I'm so burnt out. Burnt out from uni, work, and all my commitments on top of being emotionally drained as I just called off my engagement (this was all my decision, my parents would NEVER force me into a relationship).  \n\nSo for once, I want to be selfish and do something for ME and me alone but I don't want to hurt my parents. I think living alone will be the first step in building a life that I love, where I prioritise my well-being.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole for making them leave?", "created_utc": 1677428841, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cleh5/wibta_for_kicking_out_my_parents/", "score": 332, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This will be a difficult process and there is going to be massive fall out with your family unless your parents have the ability to open their minds and swallow their pride, so I would suggest you put in some backup plans before you go ahead and ask them to leave. \n\nIt may be worth considering the following \n1) as others have suggested, first have an honest conversation with your mother. Before this, speak to your sister who may have better advice than Reddit having gone through her own experience. and knowing them better than we would. You will probably need to acknowledge what they do is out of care for you but at the same time recognising all the other reasons as to why in fact it would not be truly helping you. Your best bet is probably to appeal to this side of your parents, however don\u2019t expect them to agree, it would be a huge plus but you cannot control what they think nor expect them to change, they have lived most of their lives with these beliefs and one conversation is unlikely to change that. \n2) expect that this won\u2019t go down well and plan your next steps. What if they try to double down on you and bring their family or friends? Do you have security in the building? What if they won\u2019t go, is there security on site and do they have rights to help? Can the police help you evict them? Is there a women\u2019s centre that can support you through this process? \n3) one option to consider, when does your lease end? Can you look for another place and arrange to move without your parents knowing? Could you have the conversation and the move on the same day with friends around? Same question on security, rights and support. \n4) do not let them know where you are moving to!! Meet on neutral ground if you have to, at least for a start.\n\nAnd gently cautious on this one: i would suggest you do not underestimate the power of belief and community support for your parents, they are T A in this respect for imposing these on you and not letting you grow as a person. While their values are clearly wildly different from the country in which they live, there is an equally large population that agrees with them around the world (rightfully or wrongfully so) and note they are being validated by a much wider community and the circle that they are in which won\u2019t help your case. There is a large possibility they will take this personally as an insult to their values, parenting, and then, rather than seeing the logic behind your actions. \n\nYou are NTA AT ALL for wanting to live and grow, and should be proud of yourself for recognising unhealthy relationships and boundaries! You are on a great journey for yourself and please continue to take care of yourself and treat yourself with love! That said, please also plan for the worst case scenario, this is likely to be a difficult and painful road ahead. As you say family is important to you, you also have to be prepared that what you hold dear may be shattered in this process and I hope you surround yourself with a circle of support and love as you go through this. Wishing you all the best", "NTA\n\nBut also r/raisedbynarcissists \n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. But please contact your sister and see if she can offer any advice or help", "NTA. It's your life, and you should be proud of yourself for wanting to take control of it. It takes courage to set boundaries from controlling parents like that, but you'll be so much better off for it! Good luck, I hope it all goes well. I'm sure your university can support you if you need help with anything", "Kick them out ASAP.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA  I won't downplay the torment that this situation is causing you.  I have no doubt that your parents' intentions are good.  The societal standards they are holding you to are from a time and place where a woman's value was virginity and subservience.  Where family status is linked to the successful transition of children into proper marriages.  Where how you present yourself is more important that who you are as a person.\n\nWhile this was fine for women centuries ago, times have changed.  Women are no longer dependent on men for financial security, status, and protection.  I think your question comes from you looking at the freedom of other women and wanting that freedom to.  If I were you, I would sit your mother and father down and tell them that you need them to take a vacation from parenting you and move back home.  Act like it is temporary.  If they refuse, then pack your mother's things up and when she comes into your house remove your key from her key ring and call a uber, carry her things out and pack them in the trunk and send her back home.  \n\nYou have to get strong if you want the life you described.  You can't just talk about it.  If you need to practice a speech that tells them they need to go away for three months.  If you need to, write it down.  Don't defend yourself, plead, or justify your actions.  Don't tell them what you plan to do with your freedom.  Give them a consequence if they don't agree.  Tell them if they refuse that you will go no contact with them.  This means forever.  No grandchildren, no wedding, no graduation, nothing.", "NTA\n\nI suspect it will be very difficult for you to put your foot down in terms of your parents' expectations, with a great deal of rage, threats, confusion, accusations, and guilt-induction.\n\nBut I think you should do it anyway, as your current living situation is bad for your mental health and bad for your development as the independent adult you are.\n\nYou can still be a good daughter and a good Muslim living on your own at the age of 20.  You sound extremely responsible and goal-oriented.  You're going to become a doctor, a difficult career in which you're dedicated to helping others.  You aren't wanting to live on your own in order to do anything shameful or in any way worthy of criticism.\n\nIt can be extremely difficult for parents who come from cultures or religions outside of the mainstream in the country or community where they raise their children to let go -- as you have seen.  But you shouldn't be paying for your sister's secret marriage.\n\nGo ahead and make them leave.  Do it as kindly as possible, but do it.  When they see how you are growing and thriving personally and professionally, they should be proud.", "You live in Scotland. You pay your own way. You need to tell your mother to get out of your house or they will do this to you for the rest of your life. They are over the top for Middle Eastern parents. They hide snacks? You can't have friends? \n\nAbsolutely NTA. Do not open the door for them after this. Are they the type to retaliate? I think you're probably going to need to move. How did you even get in this situation? Your mom just showed up with her stuff and started in on you? \n\nYou understand they will keep coming after you. That's why you should move as soon as you can. Scotland doesn't have trespassing laws so that makes it easier for them. \n\nA commenter left info for women's aide. Call them. I'd also see if there is a non emergency number that you can call and explain the situation and see if you can get an officer to come around when you move your mother out.", "No, they are being over protective and yiu need to ask them to leave. They will make you feel bad but you must do it", "You're an adult, do what you want. Your parents are awful and controlling. NTA", "NTA but Hey you might not wanna kick them out but instead slowly set boundries and attain freedom its slower but its easier and safer", "Please let us know how this goes!", "Oh my fellow middleeasterner family friend. \u0130 can only wish you luck. Many ppl here can even image what kind of oppression you have. My sisters having  similar treatments like you and as a big brother i am siding with their freedom. \u0130n the years of conflict with out parents we managed to change how our mother thinks but out father still causes fight in the house.", "If they don't contribute to anything yet control everything you do, out they go! You are not their property, and they do not own you. Pretty audacious of them to treat you like this and contribute nothing. NTA.", "OP is in Scotland.", "OP, if things go wrong and they won't leave, you should contact a women's shelter. Your parents have taken this too far. NTA. I hope to get to be yourself soon.", "unfortunately, so called \"honour killings\" happen even in the UK.", "Just to clarify, I wasn't saying they don't. The commenter above said they didn't know where OP was, so I provided that information.", "Girl. Y T A only because you haven't had them leave already. This is bonkers. You're a financially independent adult. I know there are cultural things at play here but time for mom and dad to GO. If it results in a year of them not speaking to you, well, them's the breaks. Would probably be a great year for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA but you're not going to be able to reason with them. Your sister eloped for a reason. Protect yourself first.", "You need to look up Scotland's laws about kicking someone out of your home. I mean, go the legal route about it. NTA", "NTA but as someone else stated be prepared for backlash from them.", "YW**N**BTA \n\n\"I am sorry mom and dad but you visits are making it hard for me to do well in school. I am evicting you. If you want to come visit for a weekend, give me a call.\"\n\nYou are an adult, these decisions are your to make. I understand that you want to do this gently as you do not want to burn bridges with them. I also don't have a concept of the cultural restrictions, so it's difficult to advise.", "Dear OP,\nDefinitely NTA.\nYou deserve to live your own life and experience it as you want. I\u2019m sure every parent is scared to let go of their kid and have them turn out different from what they had in mind. But that\u2019s the thing, you don\u2019t owe them anything and they do not own you. \nI think considering your background and how your parents have treated your sister, you cannot go through this alone. You need someone outside your family to help and guide you. \nI\u2019m not from Scotland so I\u2019m not familiar but I found this organisation that can possibly help you.\n\nhttps://ikwro.org.uk/need-help/\n\nhttps://www.scottishwomensrightscentre.org.uk/services/\n\nI suggest you contact them or another organisation that is suitable,asap to tell them your situation. This is too much for one person to handle and you need someone that can  back you up and care for your safety and mental health. Even if you think the situation isn\u2019t so bad, it\u2019s good to already have established contact. This way you know where to go if necessary and you will know the options that you have. \n\nYou are a wonderful person and I applaud your courage to speak out and to take the first steps to get the life you deserve. I don\u2019t know you but I can tell you are a strong woman and you deserve everything you want in life and the help to get there. Please be safe!", "INFO: Is there a service at your University that you can talk to without your parents knowing?", "NTA", "NTA, NOT EVEN CLOSE. Cut them off immediately. You're a legal independent adult. They have no control over you. They are abusing you.", "NTA, your parents are just guilting (re abusing) you because they don't think you'll stand up for yourself. Prove them wrong.", "NTA.  But if it's that easy to say get lost, why haven't you done it before?  I feel this isn't as easy as telling them, go home and closing the door.  Why haven't you done it before?  If the worse case scenarios happen, are you prepared?  Do you have back up from officials, or the school, friends, family?  Make sure you have your support system that will back you up.", "NTA it\u2019s not your responsibility to take care of your parents or house them", "Make sure you have all your important documents on hand first if all all possible. Idk what exactly those are in the UK, but things like birth certificate, passports etc.", "NTA. And please make someone that you can trust aware of what you're about to do and if you can have someone with you when you do it. Maybe the campus police can assist you. It feels awful to say this about your parents but this is an unsafe situation that goes beyond the boundaries of simple parental control.", "Were you underage at the time?  You're not now so that's a plus.  Would it be easier for you to just move to a new place and not tell them? Pay double rent for a month?", "NTA.  It's your life, and from what you're saying, you're responsible, and you just want to have the freedom to explore for yourself how you want to live.   (Even if you weren't responsible, the only way we learn is by making mistakes.) I'm sure they think they are doing what is best for you, but that doesn't make them right.  In the long run, you will be happier and healthier if you are independent and learn how to make decisions for yourself.", "YWNBTA\nYou deserve a free and happy life.

Change the locks. \n\nThere's no way that your parents are going to take this well so place ensure you have legal help and police on standby.", "NTA You're paying for this shit! Go home wearing what you want and when your mom acts out, throw her out. Hell, throw her out if she doesn't act out. And don't ever let your parents in again or let them know where you live when you leave university. You don't want to hurt your parents? You should or at the very least you shouldn't care. They're intolerable. As it is, you're only being an asshole to yourself. You're a legal adult, you're financially independent, you're in an incredible position, OP. Stop being afraid to stand up for yourself, no one else will.", "NTA. Tell them you don\u2019t ever want to have a family or meet anyone new. Tell them you\u2019re scared of the gender you\u2019re attracted to and you never want to date. Tell them you\u2019re scared to do anything on your own and you plan to never try. Might freak them out enough to realize they\u2019re stifling tf out of you so they back off.", "NTA. They can't withhold your rent money because they're not paying it. The same goes for your tuition. They live at your place so they can control you. Give them a deadline to leave. They may refuse to go. So if that happens, start looking for a new place and don't give them a key. Make sure they can't access your bank account or other important documents."]}
