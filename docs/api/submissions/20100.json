You have healing to do from the trauma you went through, that\u2019s your responsibility to work through without needing to take out your anger on someone who is likely just as much of a victim as you are.", "Completely agree.  Quite frankly, any time I see anyone mention Mormonism in a post on this subreddit I always vote that OP is NTA and the religion itself is the asshole.", "Damn!  Are you the OP\u2019s mom?  Or just a crusty old meanie?", "I\u2019m not OP\u2019s mom.  You can call me whatever names you want to, but I\u2019m familiar with trauma and healing, and with what will actually help OP and what is just a symptom of unhealed trauma.  Lashing out and wanting to hurt other people isn\u2019t healthy.", "NTA I also grew up Mormon and can strongly relate, especially as a queer woman. The Mormon church is an absolute cesspool.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to go through this, OP.", "NTA. \n\nReligions trauma is a thing. You might look into finding a therapist with a background in religious trauma. Sorry for your experience.", "NTA\n\nThere's this misconception, in my opinion, that crying makes someone a victim. Crying is an expression of emotion, and nothing more. Expressing an emotion likewise does not make you a victim. Your mother crying because she got told the hard reality, that by forcing you to go and preferencing her spiritual journey over your mental health, she ultimately was a major proponent of your suffering. If anything, as you said, she kind of deserves to feel distraught.\n\nThat all said, she'll likely brush it off later and try and make you out to be the bad guy, because again as I said people think tears equals victimhood.", "Nta\n\nCongratulations on getting out of that cult. It's fully understandable that them trying to break you down to force you into the cult would leave emotional scars. Your mother is responsible, but she may have not been strong enough to break the shackles on her own, and just ended up being indoctrinated. Make sure she knows that, if she wants to break free of their evil, that you will support her.", "NTA OP.  In a lot of ways, Mormonism can be much worse than the cult that the Duggars fell in with.", "If mom forced OP to attend church and reinforced their hateful views then I have trouble seeing her as a victim. Mom deserves to hear what her religious teachings caused.", "Your mother is the AH for joining a cult. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nShe's crying? Good! Make her cry every chance you get.  It serves her right for forcing you into that cult. And free yourself from all that guilt and stupidity, and live your Best life!", "NTA, and I\u2019m echoing everyone who says that religious trauma is real trauma. \n\nMy mom was raised Mormon in the 1950s, left the church as a teenager, became a feminist, got a bunch of therapy, and raised me to think for myself. I am *still* working through some of the emotional fallout that she passed down from a culture that doesn\u2019t allow you to express anger and discourages people from acknowledging their own needs. \n\nMy LDS relatives are lovely people but I cannot imagine being happy in that community.", "absolutely not the asshole. told my mom the same thing and would do it again", "NTA - your parents used religion to control you and break you down. That\u2019s a damn traumatic childhood. You have lived through very long trauma that affects you as an adult. Trauma changes the way our brain works. Took me a long time in therapy to get that", "NTA - it is true. And there is a big difference between choosing to convert as an adult to living the indoctrination, without any choice. Why was she not present, when you were having the lessons ?", "Mormonism is what she knows and chose. Doesn\u2019t need to be the case for you. \nReligion should add meaning to life, not crush your spirit. NTA", "I mean you told her the truth. Lying is a sin right? Preserve your space and wellbeing and keep staying away. NTA", "I'm glad you are out and light-years away from the church's beliefs and practices!", "Is that because of the mormons or because they're idaho and utah?", "Idaho has a lot of Mormons.  There are similar cultures in both states, but IMHO Utah, as a state, seems a bit more supportive of governmental institutions and the US Constitution.  \n\nI have no idea if the Mormon church is supportive of governmental institutions and the Constitution."]}
