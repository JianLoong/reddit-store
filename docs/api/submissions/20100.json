You might look into finding a therapist with a background in religious trauma. Sorry for your experience.", "NTA\n\nThere's this misconception, in my opinion, that crying makes someone a victim. Crying is an expression of emotion, and nothing more. Expressing an emotion likewise does not make you a victim. Your mother crying because she got told the hard reality, that by forcing you to go and preferencing her spiritual journey over your mental health, she ultimately was a major proponent of your suffering. If anything, as you said, she kind of deserves to feel distraught.\n\nThat all said, she'll likely brush it off later and try and make you out to be the bad guy, because again as I said people think tears equals victimhood.", "Nta\n\nCongratulations on getting out of that cult. It's fully understandable that them trying to break you down to force you into the cult would leave emotional scars. Your mother is responsible, but she may have not been strong enough to break the shackles on her own, and just ended up being indoctrinated. Make sure she knows that, if she wants to break free of their evil, that you will support her.", "NTA OP.

I am *still* working through some of the emotional fallout that she passed down from a culture that doesn\u2019t allow you to express anger and discourages people from acknowledging their own needs. \n\nMy LDS relatives are lovely people but I cannot imagine being happy in that community.", "absolutely not the asshole. told my mom the same thing and would do it again", "NTA - your parents used religion to control you and break you down.

It was her job as a parent to know what her children are being taught and to pay attention when her child is so disturbed by lessons that they keep \"escaping.\"\n\nReligious indoctrination of children is wrong. Much of it is abusive. Parents have no leg to stand on if their children later resent that they were fed a diet of harmful and confusing messages.\n\nIf she's a convert, then she doesn't even have the excuse of bring brainwashed as a child for believing supernatural fairy tales. For whatever reason, she bought into that stuff and forced you to be subjected to it.", "**NTA** \\- As a Newish/Convert Catholic who has struggled with the whole sin/temptation thing I don't want that for my kids yes I want them to think about their actions and be more Jesus-like in their worldly lives but to just treat people as they'd like to be treated. If they decide at 16 they don't want to go to Church anymore that's on them I've tried to give them a foundation and I really just want them to be good people. If they are I've done my job.

Raised the exact same way, but luckily had an atheist dad. It was only through him I was able to stop attending church and seminary, youth group, etc. the mormon church is an institution. It is a corporation. It is not a religion. Assuming your mother is a tithe payer, she is paying 10% of her income to a business. She is getting nothing in return. \nI blew up on my mom a few months back when I was going through cancer screening. I was losing my mind on everyone among other things. She said she was sorry that I was hurt from church, but that\u2019s about as far as it went. We haven\u2019t talked about it since. I don\u2019t bring church up to her, and she doesn\u2019t to me. \nI think what hurt the most was knowing if I stayed mormon and got married in the temple, my dad and his whole family couldn\u2019t be there. That was always so fucked up???? Like as a kid knowing half your family won\u2019t ever see you get married is such a negative feeling. Now let\u2019s address the law of chastity. My FAVORITE mormon quote is \u201cBut remember this, my son: we would rather come to this station and take your body off the train in a casket than to have you come home unclean, having lost your virtue.\u201d So many Mormons think being unpure is a sin next to murder. It hurts me that my mother thinks this way, and sees me in this light. I am not like any murderer at all. I love sex and being provocative. I love posting nudes. I love tiddies in my face. I love being able to cum by myself. All things you\u2019re taught not to do. As someone who learned how to masturbate very early, it was really upsetting. I didn\u2019t even know what I was doing, but I damn sure knew it was a SIN. I was 9 years old asking mormon god to take this affliction away from me, hoping that other girls around the world did this, that i wasn\u2019t the only one. \nI say all this telling you I understand what you are feeling and going through. And to tell you that life can get better. Getting older, you have more time by yourself. If you wanted to move to portland like I want to and be a little pothead sex hippy you have full right to do it! Do NOT keep people in your life who will shove the church in your face. Do not keep people in your life who will shove your \u201csins\u201d in your face. The mormon corporation is one of the most evil and perverse in history. They have lead so many astray from what life should be about. Being happy shouldn\u2019t require 10% of income, or wearing ugly ass underwear. You can choose how you want to be happy, and I hope you make it. \nI know this was long. Your story just stuck out to me because I have been in your shoes not even too long ago.
