My FAVORITE mormon quote is \u201cBut remember this, my son: we would rather come to this station and take your body off the train in a casket than to have you come home unclean, having lost your virtue.\u201d So many Mormons think being unpure is a sin next to murder. It hurts me that my mother thinks this way, and sees me in this light. I am not like any murderer at all. I love sex and being provocative. I love posting nudes. I love tiddies in my face. I love being able to cum by myself. All things you\u2019re taught not to do. As someone who learned how to masturbate very early, it was really upsetting. I didn\u2019t even know what I was doing, but I damn sure knew it was a SIN.

Do not keep people in your life who will shove your \u201csins\u201d in your face. The mormon corporation is one of the most evil and perverse in history.

I've seen the damage done to a girl I knew in high school when her parents converted, though.  All of a sudden, they clamped down on her HARD.  Once she turned 18, she left home and went no-contact. \n\nI'll never forget her mother telling me, with a straight face, that nobody in their church was happy about the segregation, and they were all so happy when *god changed his mind* and told the prophet that it was OK for blacks to join the church.", "NTA.

No wonder I wanted out of there! It is definitely a racist, sexist place. I mean almost all churches don\u2019t love gay people but most churches aren\u2019t racist I don\u2019t think, like come on. I\u2019d say get with the times but we accepted people of color a LONG FUCKING TIME AGO!", "According to the BITE model, what people use to determine a cult or not, Mormonism definitely is.

I carried it around for 10 years before telling anyone. It weighs on you in a way nothing else ever could and no one cares, people in the church actually have the balls to say things like \u2018that didn\u2019t happen, you\u2019re a liar\u2019. Like, I WISH I was a fucking liar at this point, at least I wouldn\u2019t have to carry around this pain and guilt anymore\nI think we made god up because we made up the devil and I truly believe we only did that because we needed to blame something for our horrible thoughts and instincts and actions. \u201cThe devil made me do it\u201d.

Does that excuse the Gulags?", "Just because something is doctrine doesn't mean it's not culture for example there are many Christian churches that consider piercings and dyed hair to be wrong and sinful, and there's no church doctrine to back this up but it's a part of that churches culture. Similarly there are Christian churches with more liberal cultures that don't care if members of their conjugation have dyed hair or a nose piercing.\n\nIn OPs case she and her mother most likely got mixed up in a church with a toxic far right conservative culture, now this isn't a criticism of all Mormons because not all of them are the same after all there are more liberal and free thinking Mormon churches in liberal and free thinking areas like Washington and California and there's more orthodox and far right Mormon churches in very conservative far right areas like Alabama and Florida just a lot of the times a church will adapt the culture of the area it was founded in and sometimes incorporate into its religious teachings most of the time not on purpose it just happens unconsciously over time.", "NTA she has the convert's fervor and inflicted it on you, unless you feel the attachment to the faith, it's not going to work and forcing someone is just going to build up resentment.", "Nope NTA here.  And yeah, I was raised Mormon and have issues now with ALL religion.  My final straw was having the Bishop wanting details of my sex life at age 15 in a \"private conversation\" with just me and him in his office.  I told him it was not his business and called him on his own kids' behavior.  His daughter used to attend church in such short skirts you could see her cheeks and his son never came to church but would make out with a girl in their car in the parking lot.  Of course this pissed him off but it pissed me off too.  Found out he was doing this with all the girls in our church. \n\nTold my parents, my dad called and I do not know what was said but after that we were NEVER welcomed again.  Oh well.   \n\nAnd your mom will be fine.  Hopefully this makes her think and wakes her up.

You deserve to speak your truth and be heard. If others feel pain and regret when you point out how they've harmed you, then that is a proper response from an empathetic human who has realized they have caused others pain. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Hopefully she takes it in good faith and grows into a better person through self-reflection. If she does not, you are not to blame.
