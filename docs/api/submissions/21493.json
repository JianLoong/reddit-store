As someone with an extremely specialized diet myself who has had to *fight* to find specific vegan brands that aren't gross, I \\*really\\* feel for your plight here. Some brands be gross and at the end of the day, vegan options like cheez and meat are very highly processed and meant to be consumed sparingly. On the other hand, your mom is very clearly yearning to feed you and care for you, and she probably looked very hard for those things she bought you and was excited to show you that she understands you and your choices. It was a very sweet and very expensive gesture.   \n\n\nWhen my mother also expressed her sadness that she felt she could no longer feed me, I sat down and wrote up absolutely every brand + item I liked, laminated it for her, and taped it to her fridge. I update it about twice a year when I find cool new things. Now, whenever she wants to get me a treat, she'll just snap a picture of it before grocery shopping and hunt for those items -- the tacit understanding being that if it's not on that list, I'm not likely to want it.   \n\n\nI know it's hard OP, but throw her a bone. She wants to feed you. Help her out and you will both benefit.", "NAH. I think this is about timing. You could have had the same conversation over dinner tonight and it probably would have hit different instead of when she'd just come home and was maybe excited to show you what she'd found, or maybe was hoping you'd enjoy whatever treat she found for you. I think that how and when this went down just kind of rained on her parade and her feelings got hurt.", "Info: is this the first time she\u2019s done this?

Serious question you didn't say", "NTA but neither is your mom.\n\nShe buys stuff because she loves you and that is how she expresses it (my mother does this too, and I am old, NOT living with her). By refusing her shopping, she feels you reject her love. Very deep shit.\n\nMy advice is: accept her shopping (love). You may not want to eat it, but eat it anway, and then slowly \"train\" her on what to buy. \"Oh I did not like this brand, would you try another one next time?\", \"Oh this product has so many chemicals listed, I researched and this other product X seems better. Do they carry it at the shop?\", etc. You CAN'T stop her from buying, she will be hurt. So, patiently guide her to buy stuff you are less uncomfortable with...\n\nAnd also, you can try moving out. That way there is less chance she buys you things you don't want/need.", "NTA - you expressly said you didn't want it, yet she did it anyway.

You drew a boundary that she's repeatedly crossed.

Yeh, I mean tone of voice etc.\n\nYou called yourself ungrateful and she won't speak to you, which makes it sound like you snapped at her..? But I don't want to assume that.\n\nEither way...It's not unreasonable to ask her to stop. And it's not unreasonable to feel like she's not listening. But you have to be nice about it and show appreciation for the fact that she was thinking of you (just not in the right way). So... if you were mean or rude, then yta. If you weren't, then nah.", "Ugh dude, I feel you on this. I have asked my mom throughout the years to please stop buying things for me, packing things I didn't ask for, and just generally giving me things I don't want/need. Because she's giving me something, she feels like I should just accept it and be grateful. To me, it feels like complete disregard for my actual need of being listened to. When I freak out about my mom giving me *more things*, people judge me for being ungrateful. But the emotional history I have with my parent is a history of not being listened to, no matter how much I ask and explain my reasoning. \n\nSo to me, she is not *giving* me something; she is *imposing* on me.\n\nIf this is a first with your mom, I hope you can talk to her about it and acknowledge that you appreciate her and her need to be needed by you. And come to a compromise. \n\nIn my case, I've had to go LC with my mom. One of my boundaries was that she has to ask me before giving me something. You know what she's done *instead*? Disguise the things she's giving me as something given by my dad, my sibling, my aunt, and everyone else's fucking neighbour - all to circumvent having to simply ASK me if I want the thing she wants to \"give\" me.\n\nOP, NTA.", "This is very good advice!

Giving you the silent treatment until you apologize, sweeping everything under the rug and acting like everything is fine afterwards, these are tactics of emotional abuse. Whether or not she intends to do it, whether or not it's on purpose, it is still emotionally abusive. I used to say that I had a great relationship with my mom except for just those few times that she would do things like this. I am more and more coming to realize that it's not healthy. It's not a great relationship. But I am working on boundaries, and the relationship is getting significantly better.\n\nI highly recommend heading over to the JustNoMIL subreddit and reading the links on the sidebar. Truly eye opening. It will be really difficult, and you may mourn the relationship you wanted to have with your mother. Some relationships can get better, some moms can change, some can't. Knowing how to set and maintain appropriate boundaries, especially around having mature, calm discussions and the fact that you deserve to get apologies too, will help if she's the kind of person who can change.\n\nI wish you luck. Please remember that you deserve better", ">i thank her every time.\n\n>she got really angry and told me i should throw it away if i don't want it.\n\n\nYep, I totally believe you.\n\nNot offended.
