I'm not expecting Jake to buy his own car or cover all the expenses. It's more about the principle of returning the car with at least a little gas in the tank, you know?

I assume you have mentioned before telling him no use of car\n\nYeah, I've brought it up with Jake a few times before. I've explained how much it means to me, especially given that I work two jobs to afford the car and the gas.

But despite my efforts, the gas tank consistently hits empty, and I'm left feeling like I'm shouldering the entire financial burden.\r So, I felt like I had no choice but to put my foot down.
