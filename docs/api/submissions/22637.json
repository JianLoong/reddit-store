I would keep this up until they clean up after their cats, or move the boxes into their bedroom.", "NTA, if you've asked them nicely several times seems fair that you did that so they get the message.", "NTA, actually that was amazing and I hope they now clean up their mess (and take good care of the cats).", "NTA\nIt's their cats so they should take care of them, not you. Tell the if they don't do that you will call animal control to take those kittens away from them. That's not the way you take care of a pet.", "NTA. Keep doing it until they take care of the kitties properly.", "NTA. cat owner here. generally the rule for litterboxes is equal to 1 more than however many cats you have (1 cat, 2 boxes, 2 cats, 3 boxes, so on and so forth). while it's good they got the second shit box, i can't blame you for doing what you did. at least you didnt put it up on their bed like i would've done lol.", "NTA. Also, the poor cats are having to walk into soiled filth to do their business. And they are having to hate which is well known to make them stressed. No wonder they act weird and kick it around.", "NTA My college roommate was a pig.  Wet towels  piled in the bathroom floor, dirty dishes in the sink until someone else washed them bc we needed them, her dirty clothes all over the apartment, panties on the sofa.  She\u2019d make a sandwich in the counter, no plate or napkin, and just leave the crumbs and mustard drips.  I finally started picking up all her wet dirty stuff and piling it all on her bed- shared bedrooms in student housing.  She complained, u told her if I had to get her mess out of my way I would be sure to leave it in her way.  The rest of the roommates were in my side.", "NTA\n\nIt's their mess. You're just relocating it to their space. Keep doing this. Perhaps they'll stop being unhygienic and inconsiderate.", "ESH. \nLike it's a dick move, but I understand how you got so frustrated that you did that. \n\nIt doesn't sound like your roommate is taking care of the cats very well if they are only cleaning litter once a month. \n\nAlso ...what's the rules on pets in your lease. Are they even allowed animals?", "ESH\n\nWorth it though right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA, but justified.", "They used to keep the one box in the laundry room, would not clean the poop and pee in it for weeks. It would smell awful and you could literally see ammonia condensation on the wall. When I asked for them to clean up or put it in their room their solution was to put a box with a hole over it so the cats can use it. Then they moved it into the shared area when they got the second one and they clean the litter box more but leave the litter on the flooring forever.", "I wouldn\u2019t dare mess with another persons bed that would have made me the asshole", "one of the cats vomits it\u2019s food up after eating almost every time and it never did that until a few months in living here. there\u2019s a stain on the recliner where it puked and they never cleaned it up. i feel bad for the kitties", "they were never that bad, but at some points my roommates lived like that. not to mention one hoards scrap in my back yard area so much that it\u2019s unusable and has weeds taller than me intertwined with all the copper and junk", "They\u2019re allowed animals and the lease even states if a mess is made it must be cleaned up or it can be cause for eviction but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they\u2019d eventually get better and they never did.

With three cats it\u2019s recommended you have four litter boxes. Daily cleaning is essential. I wish you luck! Who makes the rules? Can you get assurances that cleanup will be more regular?", "Get one of those UV flashlights and show them the cat pee that is all over, floors, walls. Then suggest they also get an enzymatic cleaning solution and get to work. Adding more litter boxes, or decreasing number of cats is a must.", "Cat are disgusting", "NTA \nAlso there needs to be a sit down about this as urine soaked litter on the flooring can often lead to the cats smelling it on the floor and now thinking they can eliminate anywhere. That is NOT a problem you want. They also have mats that have a grid you can put in front of the litterbox to help with tracking that you can then empty out...but same issue of you need to empty out and wash it regularly so cats don't piss on the mat.", "there are mat they can put in front of the litter to collect all of those litter.  it is not that expensive.  you should tell your roommate about it.  or get it for them and bill them.", "I am nose blind to it but sadly my girlfriend and my family notice it right away when they come inside my home", "Make them buy a self-cleaning litterbox.", "Isn\u2019t the rule \u201cbox per cat +1\u201d?", "lmao they aren\u2019t going to do that"]}
