We have never been close as siblings. Growing up, he was constantly abusive. As we grew up, Tom became an addict and his behavior continued to worsen. Since he was 15, the only time he has ever been sober for more than 6 months was when our dad put him in rehab when Tom was 25. Our dad did this to get Tom back into his daughter's life after he abandoned her when she was 3 and fled across the country. When Tom first left rehab, our Dad sent him to live with me, pleading for my aid since I was close to my niece and the \"responsible one in the family.\" I was reluctant, but allowed it after what I believed to be a sincere apology for past behavior from Tom. Within 8 months, he relapsed twice, and no one in our family would intervene to help. During this time, my now-husband, moved in with me to act as a buffer of protection from Tom. Ultimately, I was attacked by an addict that Tom had invited into my house before disappearing to shack up with a girl. Afterwards, our family finally condemned his behavior, but none of them would help to protect my niece, whom Tom now had for weekend visits. Eventually, Tom was arrested during one of his weekends. Afterwards, my niece's mother moved several hours away and cut contact. I haven't been able to see my niece since then. Tom has never apologized for any of this. As for Tom, within 3 months his new girlfriend was pregnant and they were married. They had a son who was almost removed from their custody upon his birth. At the time, our family pressured me to take custody of my nephew so he wouldn't be taken. I wasn't financially stable, had just married, and was struggling with my disability. I was in no position to take in an infant. I also knew the first time Tom got sober for even a month, he and his wife would be on my doorstep demanding their child. Furthermore, my husband was/is staunchly against any involvement with Tom. It's been a few years since then. Tom and his wife have had continued run-ins with family services. Through it all, I've been NC. I've met my nephew in passing and I've always been friendly - but since I'm NC with Tom, he doesn't know me. He's 5 now. This past year, Tom developed a worsening seizure disorder that has gone untreated due to his inability to remain sober. In the last month, he's been to the hospital at least once a week. His wife has also been declared unfit by family services, and she is not to be unattended with their son. Last week, our dad called to say they suspect Tom will soon die. They're trying to make arrangements, including assigning someone to raise his son. Apparently, I'm their best option. Tom and our Dad said that I would need to \"step up immediately to form a relationship with my nephew\" and that \"my cruelty towards him would no longer be tolerated.\" I told them no. Now everyone in my immediate family is sending me harassing messages that I'm heartless \"because family looks out for family.\"\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693252405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163w4em/aita_for_letting_my_nephew_go_into_foster_care/", "score": 231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The parents never did \"get it together\" and came in and out of her life...well they still do, but she/we are much better equipped to handle it now. Plus, it's not just the parents, it was a constant parade of other family (in our case the mother's family; I was distantly related by the marriage of a cousin to the father) who wanted to try to take custody and we would have her for a while, then she'd go to her grandma or great-grandma or an aunt, but their health wasn't good and they would sometimes take in a relative who it was not ok in the eyes of the court for \"my daughter\" to be housed with. We've had her with us more than not over the course of her life and I think we gave her enough stability, and she is truly thriving now. She's grown into a very strong young lady and she's learned how to love her bio parents and extended family without giving into their neediness and (sometimes) manipulative tactics. They do love her, as best they know how, and most of them have only the best of intentions, but they seem try to drag her down with them whenever they can, and she has had to learn how to deal with this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway...sorry for my long rambling story, but since no one here knows me I can say that although I love love love my \"daughter (we were never allowed to adopt her and her family does not like us to call her that)\", I can tell you that if I had known 18 years ago how difficult this was going to be and the impact it was going to have on the entire rest of lives (so far) as well as on our son's (not born at the time), I probably wouldn't have done it.

He was even given referral to one of the best specialists in our area and set up an appointment that he wound up not going to because he was high. About 2 months ago, Tom was supposed to see his GP to get started on seizure meds, but was never able to fulfill that prescription because he tried to steal the doc's prescription pad while there and got caught.
