We have never been close as siblings. Growing up, he was constantly abusive. As we grew up, Tom became an addict and his behavior continued to worsen. Since he was 15, the only time he has ever been sober for more than 6 months was when our dad put him in rehab when Tom was 25. Our dad did this to get Tom back into his daughter's life after he abandoned her when she was 3 and fled across the country. When Tom first left rehab, our Dad sent him to live with me, pleading for my aid since I was close to my niece and the \"responsible one in the family.\" I was reluctant, but allowed it after what I believed to be a sincere apology for past behavior from Tom. Within 8 months, he relapsed twice, and no one in our family would intervene to help. During this time, my now-husband, moved in with me to act as a buffer of protection from Tom. Ultimately, I was attacked by an addict that Tom had invited into my house before disappearing to shack up with a girl. Afterwards, our family finally condemned his behavior, but none of them would help to protect my niece, whom Tom now had for weekend visits. Eventually, Tom was arrested during one of his weekends. Afterwards, my niece's mother moved several hours away and cut contact. I haven't been able to see my niece since then. Tom has never apologized for any of this. As for Tom, within 3 months his new girlfriend was pregnant and they were married. They had a son who was almost removed from their custody upon his birth. At the time, our family pressured me to take custody of my nephew so he wouldn't be taken. I wasn't financially stable, had just married, and was struggling with my disability. I was in no position to take in an infant. I also knew the first time Tom got sober for even a month, he and his wife would be on my doorstep demanding their child. Furthermore, my husband was/is staunchly against any involvement with Tom. It's been a few years since then. Tom and his wife have had continued run-ins with family services. Through it all, I've been NC. I've met my nephew in passing and I've always been friendly - but since I'm NC with Tom, he doesn't know me. He's 5 now. This past year, Tom developed a worsening seizure disorder that has gone untreated due to his inability to remain sober. In the last month, he's been to the hospital at least once a week. His wife has also been declared unfit by family services, and she is not to be unattended with their son. Last week, our dad called to say they suspect Tom will soon die. They're trying to make arrangements, including assigning someone to raise his son. Apparently, I'm their best option. Tom and our Dad said that I would need to \"step up immediately to form a relationship with my nephew\" and that \"my cruelty towards him would no longer be tolerated.\" I told them no. Now everyone in my immediate family is sending me harassing messages that I'm heartless \"because family looks out for family.\"\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693252405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163w4em/aita_for_letting_my_nephew_go_into_foster_care/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's just something to think about if you do let him go into foster care. \n\nBut I don't think you are the a-hole, it's Tom's fault for being reckless and you shouldn't be blamed for the decision you think is best for you.", "NTA it\u2019s a very emotional situation. I\u2019ve been in similar position although not so dire. But an abused and neglected kid needs more than love and a home. They need a lot of energy and care and separation from links to the abusers in their life. And at the end of the day you have to not be guilt driven here, it won\u2019t lead to a good outcome for you or the kid.", "NTA, taking on parenting isn\u2019t for everyone and that would derail your entire life. It\u2019s a huge ask and it\u2019s frankly not okay to pressure you. Your whole family sucks.", "Yeah, you have to be really really careful in these kind of situations. My husband and I took in a very remote family member as a very young child \"temporarily,\" while her parents got their act together. She is currently almost 20 and we are basically her parents. At this point we love her more than anything and wouldn't give her up for the world, but it's been a difficult 18 years. The parents never did \"get it together\" and came in and out of her life...well they still do, but she/we are much better equipped to handle it now. Plus, it's not just the parents, it was a constant parade of other family (in our case the mother's family; I was distantly related by the marriage of a cousin to the father) who wanted to try to take custody and we would have her for a while, then she'd go to her grandma or great-grandma or an aunt, but their health wasn't good and they would sometimes take in a relative who it was not ok in the eyes of the court for \"my daughter\" to be housed with. We've had her with us more than not over the course of her life and I think we gave her enough stability, and she is truly thriving now. She's grown into a very strong young lady and she's learned how to love her bio parents and extended family without giving into their neediness and (sometimes) manipulative tactics. They do love her, as best they know how, and most of them have only the best of intentions, but they seem try to drag her down with them whenever they can, and she has had to learn how to deal with this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway...sorry for my long rambling story, but since no one here knows me I can say that although I love love love my \"daughter (we were never allowed to adopt her and her family does not like us to call her that)\", I can tell you that if I had known 18 years ago how difficult this was going to be and the impact it was going to have on the entire rest of lives (so far) as well as on our son's (not born at the time), I probably wouldn't have done it. And I would have missed out on knowing a beautiful and spectacular young lady, BUT I would not have known this so I would not have missed it.", "He is young and has a lot of chances for adoption. Not all kids stay in the system for ever, except ones with disabilities and severe mood swings and hospitalization.", "I've been NC with our mom since I was 18, and LC with our dad since right after Tom left my home because he had issues respecting my boundaries about being NC with Tom. Honestly, I'm about ready to cut him off too.", "Truthfully, I was already told the first time family services was involved after my nephew's birth that I wasn't an ideal placement by family services because of my disability. \n\nThis time however, I haven't heard from CPS or any other organization outside of the family. I'm not even sure who I would contact. I believe my family is pushing to resolve everything before anything can happen to Tom, because if family services gets involved first, I won't be an option.", "I appreciate your candor. Truthfully, that kind of experience is what I'm most afraid of given my health. I have to have MRIs and full check ups every few months because of my disability to make sure my condition isn't about to kill me. On top of that, I'm not great at managing my stress and it typically affects my health adversely in drastic ways. For example, I developed multiple stomach ulcers when Tom lived with me and had to have surgery after he left so I could eat because I was constantly having trouble keeping food down. I think it might kill me if I got attached to another kid I couldn't protect, like my niece.", "It\u2019s totally a risk for sure! Especially in OP\u2019s case where there is already a track record of no support from her family when she takes them in. \n\nI hope you are so appreciated for what you did, and sounds like you got a great hanai daughter out of the deal!", "Naw. The age doesn\u2019t matter. Kinship placement regardless of age is always sought and desired.  I bet the grandpa doesn\u2019t want the responsibility", "NTA. I had a situation a long time ago where I wanted to adopt my step daughter's daughter- she was about to sign off on her parental rights because her current boyfriend didn't like the child. I held back, because I knew the SD would show up in a few months, demanding her back, and throwing the child's life into chaos again. She was adopted by a wonderful family.  This will happen to your nephew.  He may end up into a foster to adopt family, and not bounce around foster homes .  Do what is best for you.", "Your dad is young. He doesn\u2019t want the responsibility. That\u2019s it.  Let the state take him, terminate rights on the drug addict mom and he will be adopted to a good home. He\u2019s very young and his chances of being adopted to a good family are high.", "Cut EVERYONE out!!! Now!!!", "If you have difficulties with stress that exacerbate health issues you absolutely should NOT do this. The stress will be endless.\n\nThe boy is very likely already troubled and maladjusted. You said there is an issue with drugs with your brother; if this also true about the mother, well, this is a nightmare you don't want to enter. She'll get clean, she'll try to take him for a while, she'll lose him again, he'll be back on your doorstep. Repeat. He will see things a child should never see and it will mess him up. You will grow to love him, and it will tear you apart to watch him be torn apart, and you will break inside every time he is taken away from you again but you won't be able to let him show it. He will be clinging to you, screaming \"I don't want to go, don't make me go\" and you will have to keep your cool (for his sake) and pull him off of  you so he can go where the courts dictate.\n\nMy situation was not nearly as bad as that (there were drugs involved for both my daughter's parents but luckily she was never privy to any real ugliness) but I was part of a support group for \"parents\" like me for a while and I heard some heartbreaking stories. \n\nDon't do it. You're NTA.", "BeomPeach is talking out of their ass.  Kinship placement is always soy the regardless of age. Unless grandpa has issues or history making him unfit.", "I can see age being an issue. While many are lucky to get into old with good health, sadly the passage of time means things like dementia and other health issues crop up. A former coworker of mine I found out recently had to retire early and also give up custody of her granddaughter to her son (the granddaughter was her daughter\u2019s child, but she died in an accident several years ago along with her husband)  because she has been diagnosed with young onset Alzheimer\u2019s at 57 and sadly it\u2019s progressing much faster than anyone could\u2019ve imagined. A year ago, she was fine and was running a very busy department at my former employer. Now, her short-term memory is so poor she literally can\u2019t remember whether or not she has eaten breakfast or not.", "I don't think it would change anything with my niece's mom, but it would probably impact my niece. Before they moved away, she used to tell me that even though she knew she shouldn't, she hated her little brother.\n\nTom never married her mom, and was gone by the time she was three. Before our dad began pushing for Tom to get back in her life, he didn't even send birthday cards or call for all the years he was gone. To her, it felt like Tom was more willing to try for his son than he was willing to try for her.\n\nI don't know how she feels about it all currently, since I haven't been able to see her or talk much since they moved. Also, the few times we have talked, her mom always made it clear she didn't want me to talk about Tom even if my niece asked first. I've always respected that since I didn't want to risk losing what little contact we had, so I genuinely don't know if she even thinks about her younger half-brother or Tom.", "Not in the USA", "I guess in the US it is preferred but in Germany we have different rules.", "That's wild. \n\nDoes your country have a functional system as an alternative? Or is it just throwing children into the system unnecessarily?", "What about the mother's family?", "\ud83d\ude02 my dad is 86 and he\u2019s an alcoholic!  He\u2019s still moving along!!! So stop the BS statistics!", "\ud83d\udcaf I've seen this. Lady 75 and was raising her 2 yr old great grandchildren who accidentally hit her in the eye with his toys. Felt so bad for lady in her late 70's chasing toddler", "They argue that the grandparents could die before the kids are old enough. They won\u2019t place a 3 year old with grandparents that are 73. because in their opinion the kid will still get into the system because they wont be 18 until the grandparents die.", "They can take him or foster care is best for him.", "Contact family services now.  IF he is dying and she is not fit they can step in now and declare you unable to care for this child.", "Oh I agree with you. I've asked our Dad multiple times why he can't raise Tom's son. He owns his home and multiple other properties that he rents out, plus he has a great retirement income. On top of that, he would also have my Step-mom to help him. But it always comes back to, \"We're too old to be chasing after a child.\" and \"I've already spent a lot of money and my life helping you kids, I just want to enjoy retirement.\" \n\nShort to say, at least in my opinion, \"It's okay for me to be selfish, but not you.\"", "I would agree with the part \u201etoo old to be chasing\u201c as a kid has demands and wants to do activities which might require someone who can keep up (like going on a rollercoaster later, waterpark etc)\n\nBut the second part is selfish. If he would say: i would financially support you looking after the boy because I am physically not able to it would be another story. Cause then he would show that it is important to him and he would help. And you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about costs."]}
