{"id": 25745, "submission_id": "163w4em", "title": "AITA for letting my nephew go into foster care?", "selftext": "I (30F) have an older brother (35M) let's call Tom. We have never been close as siblings. Growing up, he was constantly abusive. As we grew up, Tom became an addict and his behavior continued to worsen. Since he was 15, the only time he has ever been sober for more than 6 months was when our dad put him in rehab when Tom was 25. Our dad did this to get Tom back into his daughter's life after he abandoned her when she was 3 and fled across the country. When Tom first left rehab, our Dad sent him to live with me, pleading for my aid since I was close to my niece and the \"responsible one in the family.\" I was reluctant, but allowed it after what I believed to be a sincere apology for past behavior from Tom. Within 8 months, he relapsed twice, and no one in our family would intervene to help. During this time, my now-husband, moved in with me to act as a buffer of protection from Tom. Ultimately, I was attacked by an addict that Tom had invited into my house before disappearing to shack up with a girl. Afterwards, our family finally condemned his behavior, but none of them would help to protect my niece, whom Tom now had for weekend visits. Eventually, Tom was arrested during one of his weekends. Afterwards, my niece's mother moved several hours away and cut contact. I haven't been able to see my niece since then. Tom has never apologized for any of this. As for Tom, within 3 months his new girlfriend was pregnant and they were married. They had a son who was almost removed from their custody upon his birth. At the time, our family pressured me to take custody of my nephew so he wouldn't be taken. I wasn't financially stable, had just married, and was struggling with my disability. I was in no position to take in an infant. I also knew the first time Tom got sober for even a month, he and his wife would be on my doorstep demanding their child. Furthermore, my husband was/is staunchly against any involvement with Tom. It's been a few years since then. Tom and his wife have had continued run-ins with family services. Through it all, I've been NC. I've met my nephew in passing and I've always been friendly - but since I'm NC with Tom, he doesn't know me. He's 5 now. This past year, Tom developed a worsening seizure disorder that has gone untreated due to his inability to remain sober. In the last month, he's been to the hospital at least once a week. His wife has also been declared unfit by family services, and she is not to be unattended with their son. Last week, our dad called to say they suspect Tom will soon die. They're trying to make arrangements, including assigning someone to raise his son. Apparently, I'm their best option. Tom and our Dad said that I would need to \"step up immediately to form a relationship with my nephew\" and that \"my cruelty towards him would no longer be tolerated.\" I told them no. Now everyone in my immediate family is sending me harassing messages that I'm heartless \"because family looks out for family.\"\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693252405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163w4em/aita_for_letting_my_nephew_go_into_foster_care/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think that's part of the reason they're rushing to get everything resolved before anything happens to Tom. \n\nIf my nephew isn't placed with someone and Tom dies, I'm not sure if family services would just come knocking or if they'd be inevitably called in by mandated reporters (the most recent issue that led to Tom's wife being declared unfit came after a teacher reported her for trying to pick her son up from school over an hour late and absolutely wasted), but if it's left up to family services, I wouldn't be considered an ideal candidate and he'd probably be taken into foster care.\n\nMy family doesn't want my nephew removed from the family. In their minds, that's the worst thing that could happen, so I think that's why they're trying so hard to pressure me right now.", "If your father is healthy and an option why is he not trying to take your nephew then? \nSince it is an option and possible? \nThen i do not understand his problem.\nI understand a worry about age and maybe you could talk about what would happen to your nephew in case your father dies (sorry to be so blunt but you have to think of all options)"]}
