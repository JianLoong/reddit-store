There is a homeless man who we often see sleeping rough in our neighborhood and we were worried about whether he would survive the coming weather so we offered him to come inside for a few days. Now it has been two weeks and it is back in the 60s, but he is refusing to leave, even though he agreed from the beginning that this would just be a temporary arrangement for the duration of the cold spell.\n\nWe have reached out to help him connect with a social worker and resources for getting shelter and a job long-term, but it seems like wait times for these programs are typically months if not years. We have offered to give him some money if he will leave that he can use towards a deposit for an apartment or for a motel. We have even threatened to call the police if he does not leave of his own accord, though I hesitate to actually act on this given horror stories about law enforcement interactions with homeless people, as well as what an arrest would mean for his prospects of being able to take advantage of any of those programs.\n\nHe has made no movements towards leaving and just keeps repeating when we bring it up that he has nowhere else to go. So far he has been polite and mostly keeping to himself, and we have avoided precipitating a confrontation because we do not know what he might do if he gets angry. However, my husband and I will have to go back to work this week and I don't want to be alone with him while my husband is not here, and I certainly don't trust him to be alone with our kids. AITA?\n\nEDIT: WIBTA if I activated law enforcement? I don't know how else to get rid of him but I would also feel terrible if through my attempt at a \"good deed\" he ended up worse off than he was before, best case scenario with an arrest or criminal charge, worst case scenario... let's just say the police in our area do not have a reputation for being \"gentle\" or empathetic towards homeless people\n\nEDIT #2: Thought this didn't have to be said but obviously, comments which stigmatize homeless people as an entire group are \\*not\\* it ", "created_utc": 1672523907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1004quy/aita_for_asking_a_homeless_man_to_leave_our_home/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told him what would happen if he didn't honor your agreement. He didn't honor your agreement. Therefore, he has essentially consented to being dragged out by the authorities.", "NTA. Get him out ASAP before it legally becomes his home. Call the police. Call an attorney. TODAY.", "I\u2019ve been in this almost exact situation!

Depending on your area, he may be close to establishing himself as a non-paying lodger, and it could take 30-60 days to get him out. For your kids safety, tell him to leave TODAY. If he won't, involve the police. An arrest at that point would only be his own fault.", "NTA and like so many others have said, get him out ASAP before he can legally claim tenant's rights.

Get him out, now.", "NTA...\ud83d\ude02 yeah that was very stupid move on your part. inviting a homeless person into your home. Most of the time they have some kind of addiction or mental illness and you are inviting a potentially dangerous person into your home. They burned all their bridges with their friends and family so they are on the streets. Next time use your brain instead of your liberal bleeding heart. any one could have seen this coming. Kick him out and if he does not want to leave get law enforcement involved. At least the jail cells would be warm.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But in most states in the US, once someone has stayed somewhere for a predetermined number of days (5-14 usually), then they're technically a resident of the property and have to be evicted through the court. Even if they're not paying rent, even if they're no longer invited, or never were invited. Good luck.", "NTA but social services can\u2019t remove him from your home. They can find him a place to go eventually but they have no authority to make him leave and can\u2019t force him to accept help. Plus, it takes time and anything that is available is usually full in the winter.

Wait till he goes out for food or drugs then stack any belongings outside", "You need to get rid of him not because you are a bad person but because your first responsibility is towards your family and kids. You state that in couple of days you will be left alone with this man when your husband returns to work. Has it ever crossed your mind that you may be in danger then? What about your kids, do you want to put them in danger because you feel guilty about a good deed you did and got punished for? Homelessness is horrible in this country, no doubt, but you need to make sure YOUR family comes first and not some misguided sense of empathy.", "NTA. You offered temporary shelter, not a permanent home. Please keep us updated on the situation.", "Also, the police may not help. Often times they will consider this a civil issue and not deal with it.

Then, after taking care of the bill, I'd sneak off, get in my car and drive off. I'd make sure to have lunch somewhere far, far away but close to a homeless shelter.

This is why you never let people stay at your house for any extended period of time if there is any chance they won't leave willingly.\n\nHonestly OP, your best bet may be to gently force him out and hope he doesn't call the cops. Do you have any large male relatives or friends that can help gently muscle this guy out? Form a circle around him and walk him to the door. If he becomes violent, then the cops will absolutely help. Try to call the non emergency line first. Maybe the cops will be sympathetic and help if you explain the situation to them. I am so sorry you have to deal with this. You were just trying to be a good human and you are getting shit on because of your kindness.", "He's not an intruder. He was invited in. He was asked to leave but now he has rights.", "That\u2019s only effective if he actually leaves.
