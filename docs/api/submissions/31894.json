We have been living together for about 2 months now, dating for about a year, and this is our first major issue, because neither of us will back down. \n\nSarah and I both love animals, she has a dog and two parrots, and I have a ball python and some fish. One of the reasons we started dating was because im in college for zoology, which is her favorite subject, and it was the first thing we had in common. I love her animals very much, and she loves mine, my python too (though she didn't at first \ud83d\ude05)\n\nSarah now wants a cat or two, which I have no issue with. I love cats, had two growing up, and I was really excited about the idea because as much as I love my snake, he doesn't always like being handled. \n\nBut the issue is Sarah is being INSISTENT that the cats be allowed outdoors. She says 'it's cruel to lock them up inside.' Being a zoology major, as well as being well versed in invasive species as a whole, I am adamantly refusing because i know how bad outdoor cats are for the ecosystem and that cats live shorter lives on average outdoors. I also pointed out that the 'cruel' rhetoric is false, and that there was nothing cruel about keeping a domesticated pet inside, like I do with my snake and her with her birds. I told her we will not get ANY cats if she wants them to be outdoor. \n\nI have tried offering her a couple solutions. I own the house, which I bought after some issues with former roommates. Because of that, I offered to build a big catio next to our 4 season porch so the cats can go outside without hurting the ecosystem. I offered to leash/harness train the cats, which means they can have outdoor time the same as her dog, Hershey. Both of these solutions have been shot down, with her saying they should be allowed to free roam like her cats did when she was a kid. \n\nI have refused. I told her we won't get any cats if she is insistent on this ridiculous outdoor rule. The last time we talked about it, i asked her why is she so demanding on this when she wouldnt let her dog run around off leash. She claims its different, and i told her it ISNT really different. She has been cold and quiet towards me ever since. I KNOW I'm not in the wrong here, from an ecological standpoint, but this has caused a huge problem for us and it's made me feel like I'm an ass for wanting to protect the environment.\n\nAITA for refusing to have outdoor cats?", "created_utc": 1701125550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185gdlt/aita_for_refusing_to_have_an_outdoor_cat/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Growing up, all my family had were outdoor/indoor cats. One(that we know of)got hit by a car, one was disposed of by a neighbor because it was cantankerous and territorial and would fight other cats, and some just disappeared forever. We had coyotes in the area so when a cat would go missing, we'd just assume it was either a car or a coyote that got it. It hurt every time. Only 4 of the, I shit you not, dozen or more cats we had made it to elderly cat status. \n\nNow, all my cats are indoors only.

A catio sounds like a great compromise. \n\nThat said, where I live, because it's partly rural, there are organizations that adopt out \"barn cats\" - formerly feral cats who don't have the temperament to be indoors, but do need a proper home nonetheless. I don't know if that's a compromise you can both live with. I mean, I don't love it, but one could argue that it's better than cats actually being feral or living in a shelter.", "NTA.

It also craps in my yard which I don\u2019t appreciate.", "Nta- I have multiple ferals and I fear for their lives every day. If you adopt, many places have in their contract that they should be indoors only. It's pointless to adopt them just to risk their lives and let them outside.", "NTA. My indoor cat has been in the real outside exactly once and it was the worst experience of his life. Ask me about 8k in vet bills (including surgery and two emergency chest aspirations) to save his furry little life. He wants exactly zero things to do with going outside now.  He perfectly happy to wage bird wars through a securely shut sliding glass door, thank you very much. He won\u2019t even go out an open door if it leads to the Great and Terrible Outside House. Keep those kitties inside where they have catnip and scratchy posts and piles of blankies.", "NTA. Nothing is as cruel as having to put your cat down because it wasn't allowed stay inside (I had no choice in the matter, as a kid). Cats give other cats wonderful things like Feline Leukemia. Owls and foxes and Coyotes attack outdoor cats. They get hit by cars. And let's not forget the odd dog or cruel human. Hard pass. I will never have an \"outdoor\" cat again. It's all inside from here.", "NTA. What\u2019s interesting is that she seems to have no issue keeping her BIRDS inside!  I would think that it\u2019s much more cruel to keep a flying creature indoors, where they can\u2019t really fly, than a cat who can still do plenty of roaming around inside\u2026especially with a catio.  I agree that you are doing the right thing.  Can you find stats, etc on the lifespan of outdoor vs indoor cats? Or point out the hypocrisy re: her birds?", "If you actually care about your family pets, indoor only to love, cuddle, play with. If not this, not family, don't bother. I trap ferals, their outdoor life is horrible, fleas, fights, damage from assholes and cars. Essentially you just have a feral cat.", "NTA!\n\nI have a relevant perspective to add to this, you might want to share it with her.\n\nMy family has spent years working with a cat charity and by extension veterinary clinics and the veterinarian school of the local university. We've had I don't even know how many fosters come through our house on top of the ones we own. Mothers and kittens, just kittens, and ones and twos of all shapes and sizes. Some for days, some for weeks, some for months. 98% of them lived. Some only because of the efforts of the vets and the care they received.\n\nThe reality of feral/outdoor cats is heartbreaking for people who love animals, and that's just from the cats perspective. Missing teeth, broken bones. Very rarely missing limbs.\n\nThe older ferals are missing the tips of their ears and tails from night out in freezing temperatures (it gets to -40 some weeks here during the winter). They're covered in scars and do NOT like people. Cats with infections and parasites, missing chunks of fur. Some of the kittens we get are literally wasting away from parvo (which is a whole new kind of smell).\n\nOut of all of that, there's only one kind of cat we've never seen.\n\nOne that's been attacked by something other than another cat.\n\nOr a human.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common?\n\nThey're all grateful to finally be inside. Especially the mothers with kittens.\n\nI understand your GFs desire to let your cats roam free, it's something I struggle with too. But the reality is that cats are not meant to be here. It's dangerous to let them roam unsupervised, and feral cats are both a huge problem (as cute as they are) and suffer more than they should.\n\nA big part of solving that problem is educating people on why cats should always be fixed, and why cats are always indoor cats. As much as they might beg to the contrary. And considering that it's the exact same sound they make when I'm opening a can of food, I'm pretty sure they'll survive. And your cats will too :P", "NTA. It's not cruel to have domesticated indoor pets when they have access to enclosed outdoor areas or leashed walks as you have offered. It IS cruel to local bird and wildlife to deliberately introduce non-native predators to their habitat. Your housemate has no argument here - they just prefer their personal preference and convenience to ecological, sustainable and cruelty-free options.", "Sarah needs to go work at a vet office for a while and see the injuries that come in on outdoor cats. I know it works for some people, but after I saw what came into my office, I won\u2019t ever have a cat outside again. We have too many predators where I live, and too many chances of being hit by a car or poisoned by someone who doesn\u2019t like cats. NTA", "NTA. My outdoor Angora mix cat was a menace. He always came back, but he fought a lot with strays (both cats and dogs). Once he came with his throat bleeding from being mauled by a hunting dog and I thought he was a goner. He survived many more years, but not every cat has that kind of luck. PS. I was a toddler and the cat did really enjoy being outside laying on the grass of the garden, but he also was very territorial and would jump at anything and anyone that wasn\u2019t in the household. \n\nThere are a lot of dogs who have a high prey drive and are not properly trained in recall. That would get the cats hurt or killed. And if there\u2019s a decent amount of traffic in the area\u2026 that\u2019s another factor to keep in mind.", "Do you like fleas? Because that's how you get a flea infestation in your house.", "NTA. My next cats will be indoors only, current ones are outdoors whilst we\u2019re home to look after them only.

You have every right to keep your cats inside. \n\nI am a cat owner of an indoor-outdoor cat, and we are perfectly comfortable and fine with her freedom to spend time outside. Invasive cats are unneutered, unvaccinated that multiply.

I would put that argument down with your GF because she isn't going to agree with you, it just isn't valid.\n\nFear of potential harm to your cat I get. You weigh that against \"boxing the cat up\" which I think is what your GF is against, and have to decide what is more important to you/ fair to the cat. I see both sides. I happen to agree more with your GF - my cat is 7 and has been indoor/outdoor her whole life, has cat friends she hangs out with, gets to be a hunter, has so far handled herself quite well outside -- she's happier with this freedom than she would be forced to stay inside. But I'm not your GF so you get to decide for you :)", "NTA\n\nYou are both correct, and arguing your point reasonably. It's OK to have disagreements. You don't get to be the AH just because you don't agree with your gf.", "NTA. \nYou are right, they impact the eco system. \n\nBUT! your girlfriend is also right. \nMy cat's did run 15kilometres every night. They are not happy when kept indoors, and everyone who tells you otherwise does just hide this fact from himself to justify keeping his fluffy little cutie child substitute close. \n\nSolution: Don't get a Cat. At all.", "NTA\nIt's your house, pretty much end of discussion.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've had indoor and outdoor and indoor/outdoor cats, and the indoor/outdoor ones are the happiest.\n\nAlso, the studies about the environmental impact of cats indicate a few things that I often seeglossed over. \nFirst, the study acknowledged that outdoor cats, farm cats, stray cats, and feral cats on average kill at 3 times the rate of cats that are 'allowed inside domiciles'\nSecondly, all of the extinction of bird species that was 'heavily contributed to by cats' only happened on islands.\n\nYou're the scientist so you probably know better than I do that the impact the cat will have on the environment is hugely dependent on the environment itself, and even across the US there are hugely varied environments. Are cats super killers that thrive almost everywhere? Sure. Are they also sweet, and as susceptible to being trained as any mammal, also yes.\nCats that live in the wild, are wild. Cats that just go out into the yard to get the primo sunbeams, are not wild, they're just happier than they would've been inside. Cats can fall anywhere in between.\nNot saying a cat can't be happy living only inside, but feeling grass between its little toe beans isn't something it likely wants to miss", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Apparently Reddit is full of indoor-cat advocates, so for counterpoint, I've seen some very depressed, unhealthy indoor cats.  Cats when given the choice seem to choose to go outdoors, so I think their vote should count for something.  The ecosystem impact is real, yes.  On the other hand, if you want to have less ecological impact, go vegetarian, and make your dog vegetarian.  Which you actually probably don't want to do, which is a great demonstration of how sometimes you make a decision based on what's good for the pet, not what's good for the environment.  In any case, I don't think this Reddit is the place to cook up a final ruling on whether all cats belong indoors or out.  You certainly sound like you are both experienced and responsible pet owners and your hypothetical cat(s) would be well cared for either way.\n\nBut you will need to figure out how to deal with real disagreements between the two of you.  You will need to respect her opinion and try and reach a solution that is acceptable to both of you, not leverage your power as the homeowner etc.  If I were her, that's why I would be cold and quiet--not just your views, but your belittling of hers, and \"telling her\" what the conclusion is going to be.  This puts you pretty close to AH territory.  You need to let go of \"knowing\" you're right and she's wrong, and really listen to her.  If you're still unpersuaded, which you probably will be, then express that you understand where she's coming from (if you do?), and agree to disagree while trying to work out a practical compromise.  Right now you don't respect her.  She can tell.", "I grew up on a farm with barn cats. Only a couple of them died of old age. I, a literal child at the time, decided than when I got my own cats they would never be put in danger like that. \n\nI'm just gonna give a few examples of what can happen to a cat out there. Bear in mind, these are all real situations;\n\n- A cat that was hung by it's neck on a traffic sign.\n- A cat whose face was blown off by fireworks. It is not known if the cat was alive when the fireworks went off, but a bystander had seen the cat alive with a group of teens.\n- A cat that had jumped into a fenced yard and been killed by the dog. The dog owner was not held responsible for anything as the dog was in their fenced yard, where it was supposed to be. The cat was tresspassing, so the one at fault was the cat's owner.\n- A video of a cat being carried away by a wolf.\n- Only marks left in the snow as an aerial predator had caught the cat.\n- Horrible puncture marks on another, slightly luckier cat as their owner had been fast enough to grab their cat when another earial predator tried to catch it.\n- And a story from my uncle, when his farm cat had napped under the shadow of a trailer's wheel without him noticing. He only realized something was not right after the bump. The cat had ran into the end of the driveway before collapsing. My uncle ran to get his neighbour who had a gun. The cat was still alive when they got there.\n\nI can't understand people who **know** that there is danger, yet still choose to let their cat (who they claim to love) out there on their own. It's cruel, and frankly, lazy. As OP said, you can walk them on a leash or build an enclosure for them. It just needs some effort.", "lovely how your first concern is for the animal that will kill anything it can due to instincts. the other wildlife that an outdoor cat can/will kill is more important than one cat dying because of injury, getting ill, or yes death. but you have your way of saying things", "That's what I'm so shocked at. I thought those solutions would be perfect. She's making me feel incredibly bad about all this, but I've studied this topic in school and even shown her the relevant studies like Loss et al, 2013, but she isn't backing down and im at a loss.", "I can understand that point of view, too, and I'd agree if the birds were confined to a small cage. However, Sarah's dad had special cages built for both of them, they take up about half of one of our rooms, and both parrots were initially rescues that her dad saved. Sarah also does a good amount of activities with them, and when we are home, they have free range of the basement, so I'd say they are fairly well cared for and overall happy animals.", "This. My cousin had an outdoor cat when we were kids, and she died before she reached 7. We found out she was run over a few days later.", "I have several friends who do this as well! Its a great way to ensure they get outdoor time while still mitigating their damage to the ecosystem. I wish Sarah would let us do that", "yeah, cats do more damage when let run free than dogs.  way worse", "Absolutely NTA. Stand your ground.  What is \\*up\\* with the gf's intractability? You want to keep all your animals safe and alive!\n\nI begged a former neighbor AND my new building managers not to allow their cats outside - even in deepest SoCal suburbia coyotes and cat-killing raccoons (big suckers who do it for fun) roam freely \\*everywhere.\\* Sure enough, both cats were killed & carried off. Coyotes also kill and eat small dogs (even ones in \"safe, fenced\" backyards) as well as any squirrels they can catch. If there are wild predators around, keep all small animals indoors! And don't get me started on the crazy reckless drivers around here. Squashed squirrels abound. Ick.", "Me too honestly. She's usually such a level headed and understanding person, it makes me think something deeper is going on here, but I can't think of what", "I'm happy to. A lot of folks aren't aware of the impact, and it's genuinely becoming a problem here in the US.", "Edit: This isn\u2019t sarcasm or an argument, I\u2019m only concerned about my cats and I love animals\n\nThis is so interesting because we have had two outdoor cats, our first was 21 and our current is 12 or older but she\u2019s thriving.", "Agreed. Keep cats inside.", "You've got my axe!", "This is so dramatic. 1) There is such a thing as flea prevention for cats and 2) she has a dog which is just as likely to bring fleas into the house.", "Some cats are more than happy to stay indoors.  Two of mine started life as outdoor cats, but once I brought them inside, they never, not once, tried to get out.  As far as they're concerned, my house is a paradise full of food, fresh water, toys, cat trees, and friendly human attention.  Outside is a terrifying place full of strangers, dogs, and cars.", "They don\u2019t just impact the eco-system. Domestic cats are responsible for the extinction of multiple bird species.", "I grew up on a farm and I remember when I was like 3-7 years old every summer we would get a new stray cat. Because by winter coyotes would get them. Until we got an indoor cat and that put a stop to it.", "Why do they need to say anything about the concern to wildlife when OP already made that point in his post? Should they just regurgitate what OP said and be completely redundant?", "You ever think this kind of behavior is why cat people won\u2019t make concessions for bird people", "Sounds kind of like she's on the cusp of realizing for the first time how wrong her parents/her method of having cats was and she's in serious denial. You can't be right or have any reasonable alternatives because that's a crack in her confidence armor.", "[removed]", "Seems like a questionable idea to get a cat when there's already parrots in the house no?", "I don't know whether it's cruel to keep birds or not, but I certainly think it's ridiculous that the girlfriend thinks it's ok to keep birds indoors but not cats.", "Sounds good. I grew up with a lot of birds, always felt bad for the indoor ones we kept in small cages. We had larger outdoor aviaries that were more acceptable but the pet industry still seems to push selling birds in small cages.", "And somehow, while she thinks that space and enrichment indoors is enough for the birds, somehow the same can't be done for cats? \n\nThere are many videos where people have built amazing shelves and other climbing things so cats can roam near the ceiling. I rent, so I just have a few tall cat trees and simple shelving that goes around my living room, but I dream about being able to build actual walkways for my cats.", "fairly? parrot paradise is more like it,", "I\u2019m not positive on the statistics but I think the average lifespan for an outdoor cat is something like 2-3 years where an indoor only cat is at least 10+. The disparity is enormous. Add in the devastation they cause to local wildlife and it is just unfair to keep your cats outdoors. There are exceptions for feral cats that cannot acclimate to being indoors only and are best as barn cats but those are few and far between.", "Yes, like using kids\u2019 sandboxes as litter boxes", "Have you had chats about the safety of the birds with cats indoors? Perhaps she reasoned to herself that they would be safer with outdoor cats?", "becoming? I would think with your field of study you would be aware of and acknowledge what the Audubon society has been saying for a long, long time. I think longer than 2013 but https://www.audubon.org/news/cats-pose-even-bigger-threat-birds-previously-thought", "There is always an exception to a rule and your cats fit that perfectly. It's amazing they've lived that long but that's far from the norm unfortunately.", "My parents have had about 8 barn cats. Two of them lived to be about 16-17, one of the 'youngest' ones is still alive at 15. One died at 5. One disappeared at around 7, two before turning three and one before she even turned one.\n\nMy indoor cats are two 9 year olds, one 5 and one 4. None of them have disappeared \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "And my bow!", "so do you wipe your ass and then shit? then I understand that you have no concept of prioritizing what is significant over less important concerns. how's that laundry going? you might be interested in the concept of thinking in a logical, sequential manner. That's what they do in my kids kindergarten class. I think there is room for you if you act quick", "You ever think \n\nYes\n\nthis kind of behavior is why cat people won\u2019t make concessions for bird people\n\n? no,. nor do I think that \"cat people\" should feel they are entitled to \"make concessions\" for birds, not the people.  so how many cats do you have?  you statement makes me think you may have toxoplasmosis", "[removed]", "This is an interesting point that OP should bring up", "God an Aviary would be an absolute dream. I really wanna open an Animal Rescue for all kinds of animals", "no they are not. and the idea that a bird in a cage is equivalent to a cat roaming free is a false equivalency. not even close.", "That may have some factor in it, but I told her from the get go if we get cats they won't be around the birds, just like they won't be around my snake either. We have a special room for the birds in the basement and my python stays in my office, but the cats would have free reign of the rest of the house, just like Hershey.", "I feel like a monster but I swear we have no difficulty with bird species, I\u2019m in rural area, the cats come in like dogs. This weirdo of a cat will come in to use her litter box and then go back outside sometimes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Mine are always around, that\u2019s all they know and how we got them as strays.", "We're not talking about performing a physical act that needs to be done in a certain order otherwise the whole thing gets messed up, so I don't know why you're acting like that's a good comparison. When talking about issues, you're not required to do so sequntially, but even if I agree with you, then doesn't that mean OP already covered that by talking about the bird issue, which means it would make sense for ppl to make comments after that about other issues, right? That's sequential. \n\nOP already mentioned the problem cats pose to the bird poluation. Why does anyone else need to comment repeating what OP already said before adding *other* problems that come with leaving cats outside? If a teacher was teaching a class about outdoor cats and explained how they're a detriment to bird populations and asked the class if they knew any other issues, it would be ridiculous for the students to repeat what the teacher just said, don't you think? \n\nAlso, as you can probably see from other comments, most ppl are already aware of how dangerous outdoor cats are to bird populations. This is a reddit thread, not an educational platform: it's no one's responsibility to inform everyone else what the bigger issue is or any details like that-they can easily do their own research on reliable, trustworthy sites.", "[removed]", "?\n\nI am saying a bird kept in one of those regular cages places sell and people use is much worse than a cat kept in a house. Cats SHOULD be kept in a house. With proper toys and time spent playing with them for enrichment.", "You are incredibly far from a monster! You've just hit the jackpot with a combination of great circumstances and your cat's personality! I've seen all different situations where there can be exceptions to the norm. Best practice is to keep the cats inside but sometimes it works out.\n\nMy parents have a cat who is indoor/outdoor who does the same thing as yours because he just sort of showed up one day so they feel bad forcing him to be inside permanently haha he brought a bird back once at the beginning but after realizing it wasn't a welcome gift he hasn't done it again.", "[removed]", "I feel awful and I\u2019m getting downvoted, but they\u2019re so healthy and I just feel a little crazy because it\u2019s so normal where I\u2019m from. Thank you for being really kind, I love animals and I would never ever dream of hurting anyone", "[removed]", "I think your initial comment can accidentally read like sarcasm or that you're trying to start an argument that everyone else is wrong because it doesn't match your experience. So you might get some down votes from people not understanding that you are being genuine! I'm sure it is far more common in some areas more than others and if you have never had a bad experience how would you have known any differently? \n\nIt sounds like your kitty is happy and healthy and not a menace in your neighborhood (I doubt you wouldn't see it if it was happening haha) so don't feel bad! Plus this is good for you to have the info about in case you ever move and live somewhere you might be less lucky.", "[removed]", "We don\u2019t actually have a neighborhood, we are stretched out and only near a couple of people who are like family. I swear it\u2019s not sarcastic, I\u2019ve just never seen so many people\u2019s thoughts on indoor vs outdoor cats and I feel so bad.
