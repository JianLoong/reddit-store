We\u2019ve got a daughter (2F), and have a strained relationship with his family.\n\nMy husband has additional needs (one of which being autism) that his parents refused to get him support for during his childhood because they didn\u2019t believe in the validity of his conditions. He received no support or help during school, and really struggled once he hit adulthood.\n\nHis relationship with his family (his mum and brother in particular) is distant. When we had our daughter, we\u2019d see his side of the family so much more often, but as happens with babies, once the initial intrigue dies down, so do the visits.\n\nAt first I made nearly all of the efforts in maintaining the relationship. I\u2019d send photos 5-6x a day, I\u2019d organise when who could come over (messy divorce so it\u2019s hard to have both at the same time), and would coordinate group outings. It\u2019s hard since there\u2019s always cancellations without letting us know and my MIL would always be late without letting us know, which would affect mealtimes and bathtimes since she came after work.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s first Christmas was horrific for me, trying to plan two families, and try to still enjoy myself. Eventually I confided in my husband that I was exhausted with being the only one to try, and he told me to stop.\n\nI did, and it led to a huge blow out, where my MIL eventually stated my scheduling of visits was too stressful, the facetime calls each day were intrusive, and requested she be the one to be in control. I happily gave it up, on the condition she gave us notice. This was January of 2023.\n\nThis year we have seen her in person 6 times, with the last visit being in August of 2023. We\u2019ve had no FaceTimes that we didn\u2019t initiate (and we only did this during huge milestones\u2014walking, first word), and every visit she has arranged she has cancelled.\n\nAt the beginning of November, she invited us to a family dinner that would occur at the start of December. My husband isn\u2019t close to his extended family (his mum moved closer to them during his adulthood and reconnected, but due to his autism he has struggled to form the connections), but eagerly agreed. We bought outfits, joined the secret santa etc, and then at 11pm that night she messaged and said she\u2019s really worried it would be awkward and would we mind not coming.\n\nI was upset, mainly because my husband was, but of course understood it\u2019s better to not go somewhere we weren\u2019t wanted.\n\nNow, Christmas plans will be happening and last year was so traumatic for me, that I\u2019m considering not having her come over at all. My child doesn\u2019t know who she is, there\u2019s no connection there, and she\u2019s very shy and timid around new people.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat, but I\u2019m curious as to if I\u2019d be the asshole if I put my foot down and said she isn\u2019t visiting since she\u2019s put no effort in.\n\nSo\u2026 will I?", "created_utc": 1700931456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183o248/wibta_if_i_dont_entertain_my_mil_for_christmas/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her make plans to come and call her to say it would be awkward if she came and to not come. Call her the night before she would be leaving she deserves the same consideration she gave you....none.", "NTA. Some relationships aren't worth maintaining, because they cost you your emotional health. This is one of those. It'll stress you, it'll stress your daughter, and it is obvious only wants a relationship if she doesn't have to work at it. Just say, \"We're having a quiet Christmas by ourselves and will not be entertaining anyone.\"", "YTA but for trying to force relationships when its not wanted by anyone but you. Sending pics 6x day and making intrusive facetime calls everyday to a woman who never supported your husband as a kid and he has no relationship with? Holy hell. No wonder she took over planning! And when she broke plans and the connections dropped to 6x/yr, she SHOWED you how little interest she has. Believe her and move on. Are you addicted to drama, can't take a hint, or you committed to pushing \"family\" together for some reason of tradition or because, well, it's FAMILY??? Put the wellbeing of your kid, your husband and yourself first and stop creating messes. If LC or NC is your hubby's choice, listen to him! (Of course you're MIL also is TA).", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nYour husband has to figure out his relationship with his mother. It's not your call to decide for him \"how much effort\" on her part merits a visit.\n\nBoth you and your MIL seem to have both been trying to force structure and interaction, very rigidly. Autistic or not, your husband needs to be in the lead here.", "NTA\n\nDon't have her over for Christmas Eve or Day.  Instead, if MIL wants to visit, schedule something on a weekend near Christmas.", "[deleted]", "It depends on how you go about it. If you flat out say she\u2019s not coming then YWBTA but if you draw a boundary and say she can come but this is on you to organise etc then NTA. I think the issue here is your husband hasn\u2019t shouldered the mental/physical burden even when you\u2019ve told him it has exhausted you. From what you\u2019ve said you have gone out of your way for his family to see him and your child but it\u2019s not for you to take on that responsibility. There are two other adults here that are fully capable or organising to meet. I think your husband needs to take some responsibility here and take the load off of you if he wants her to come for Christmas. It\u2019s funny your husband has said he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat but his mum has no problem in doing so by telling you both not to attend a family event the night before. It\u2019s okay to have boundaries but it\u2019s not okay to dictate what happens between them.", "If she cancelled six times prior, I don't blame you being hesitant. Ultimately, Christmas should be about your family, which is you, your husband and daughter. This should be an exciting time for you, especially with a little one. If it's too stressful to have her there, then you have the right to do what makes you most comfortable. \n\nHowever, the issue here is that your husband is not on the same page and 'putting your foot down' sounds a bit controlling. From what you've written, I get the impression that you think you know what's best for him just because he has autism. It doesn't sound like an equal partnership. If I give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe you're more aware of what his limitations are, but it doesn't give off the vibe of an equal partnership.\n\nOn another note, it's so unusual to see folks get married so young these days. You were both only 17.", "YTA You seem to have trouble reading the room. You were way too intense in the beginning. That much connection is overwhelming. It sounds like you go balls to wall with everything. Find a happy medium with your celebrations and maybe you\u2019ll enjoy yourself a bit more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You CAN however, limit what you are willing to do when she is there. You are not required to bend over backwards for her. Be nice obviously, but don\u2019t stress yourself out worrying about her.", "Grandma isn\u2019t eager to come over for visits. If she even wants to darken your door for Christmas you *could* tell her \u201cyou are worried it might be awkward and would she mind not coming\u201d, lol. (It would serve her right). \n\nBut if you want to be nice, you could tell her that you would love for her to visit between, say 2 and 4 pm. And serve her a cup of coffee and a Christmas cookie,  and escort her out after a little while because you have plans for later, thanks for stopping by! That way you don\u2019t plan your whole day around making a meal that she may just up and cancel at the last minute. \n\nIf you were a single lady in the dating world, I would tell you that she just isn\u2019t all that into you. Or her son. Or her grandchild. Focus your attentions on other relatives or friends\n\nNTA, but, damn, sending photos of your baby 5-6 times a day was a bit overwhelming, I am sure. But grandma and child don\u2019t even know each other now. Try to leave the door to that relationship open, just a bit. Without building your life around hopes for much.", "NTA keep toxicity away. Merry Christmas.", "NTA Rip the bandaid off. If the only thing you're both worried about is her negative reaction to not being invited, rather than missing the chance of seeing her, what is the point? I'd invite her only if your husband really wants her to be there.", "NTA and I get the scheduling with someone with Autism as well, which other people may not understand. We need to know plans in advance that are outside of our routine, and when the plans get changed or cancelled last minute because of our rigid literal thinking it can cause real issues. MIL sounds toxic as hell. She chose to appease her extended family over he own son and grandchild, and tty you down last minute with plans that had been made presumably for a while. I would word it all carefully as not to come across as petty or for acting out of revenge for her being inconsiderate and quite frankly rude last year, and just say you want a quiet holiday this year and won't be having visitors, or something else tactful.", "NTA- I wouldn\u2019t even worry about it. If your husband wants to see her. Have him figure it out.  If he doesn\u2019t care enough then don\u2019t bother. \n\nIt\u2019s better to have the people in your child\u2019s life that actually want to be there than try to force something that your MIL clearly didn\u2019t seem interested in.  From personal experience is much better as a child to not know your grandparents than spend time wondering why they rarely see you. I felt like I did something wrong and that it was my fault my grandparents didn\u2019t want to see me.", "NTA. I think you should talk it with your husband instead of asking to a bunch of randoms. Now being honest, I would suggest cutting your MIL off from your life. It might be an extreme decision, but I think she causes more harm than good to your relationship.", "Tell her it would be awkward and would she mind not coming", "Let your husband make the decision concerning his family and you should take a step back and relax. It shouldn\u2019t be this complicated, and if it is then maybe it\u2019s not exactly worth it. Christmas should be fun and if she\u2019s going to make you stressed out then ask her not to come and enjoy the holiday with your family. Your husband on the other hand, autistic or not should decide the kind of relationship he wants to have with his mother and you follow his lead to the best of your ability. You need to stop trying so hard to initiate a relationship with someone who isn\u2019t willing because it\u2019s going to take a toll on you sooner or later.

Actually a lot of people REALLY DONT LIKE them. Especially with someone they aren\u2019t close with.\n\n\n\nAutism is also just kind of coming around as a talking point. There is a very high chance that when your husband was a kid it wasn\u2019t being discussed by his doctors (which is very different then his parents ignoring it)\n\n\n\nJust don\u2019t invite her, see what happens.
