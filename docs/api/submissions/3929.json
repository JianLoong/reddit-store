My son didn\u2019t really want to meet her at first but after a few months he did. My daughter hasn\u2019t met her.

My son has never said he has a problem with me posting pictures with his kids and he didn\u2019t say anything about this after I did it.\n\nMy daughter called me and said I shouldn\u2019t be posting that and it\u2019s tacky. I say why?? This is my gf and she was there and they are great pictures. She says that the grandkids just had a different wife from me that they thought was their grandma but wasn\u2019t really their grandma last year and that I shouldn\u2019t be introducing someone to them at 6m and absolutely no pictures. Then she says I can\u2019t meet her new baby (she\u2019s pregnant) bc I make everything about having my gf front and center. I asked if I married my gf if it would be appropriate then and she said no because marriage doesn\u2019t mean anything if it\u2019s a fourth marriage. \nBasically it\u2019s like my daughter is saying I need to be alone forever from now on or I can\u2019t be in the family anymore.

Literally nobody is telling you this. What everybody is telling you, and you are failing to listen to, is that they would like better communication and a slower timeline. That you are forcing everybody into things before they are comfortable. That it's your way or the highway. \n\nYou are failing to compromise on anything and positioning yourself as the victim when you hear that your demands are too much, too soon.

Listen to what they are actually saying, stop being defensive, and respect their boundaries.", "It's not that it's 4 marriages but the fact that they don't last long. It's not good for kids to get attached over and over just to never see those people again. Yta.\n\nWait for the relationship to age a few years before introducing them. You can spend time separately with each group. One outing with your grandbabies and a separate one with your gf until your kids are okay and trust you and your gf.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nShe never said that you need to be alone forever, that's you being melodramatic and fishing for sympathy.\r  \n\r  \nWhat she's doing is telling you her boundary and that she's sick of rotating stepmothers in her life, especially in regards to her children getting attached to one and then that woman is suddenly gone. Now you have a six month relationship, which is still very new, and are already posting pictures like you're some big happy family. \r  \n\r  \nYou need to respect that your daughter doesn't want you taking pictures of her kids with your gf and posting them online.", "INFO: Are you telling the kids to call each of your wives/gfs \"grandma\"? I wasn't clear from your post if that's what you meant.", "Sounds like she never said you need to be alone forever and you\u2019re purposely missing her point. Young children do not understand the concept of you trying out new girlfriends and THREE women to a SIX YEAR OLD is confusing and you shouldn\u2019t be bringing all these strangers around. You can have your girlfriends, but actually get serious with them for once before you start doing this crap. Yta", "YTA\n\nShe never said for you to be alone. You are confusing the grandkids by having rotating women in their lives.", "INFO: how old is your girlfriend?", "YTA. I don't see you mentioning anywhere that your son knew and approved of you introducing your current GF to his kids, or you just showed up with her.\n\nIt's not up to you who meets THEIR kids. It's up to the parents, period.\n\nYou've been married three times before. I don't blame them in the slightest for not wanting your current gf being introduced to their kids. People don't want their kids getting attached to people that may or may not be there in the future. \n\nAnd the whole, 'I need to be alone forever' is nonsense. Your daughter doesn't trust your judgement, and it's going to take time for it to be earned. Your kids were impacted by your serial marriages, and your daughter at least, isn't willing to put her child through it too.", "I think what she's saying is that your girlfriend should not be in any family pictures. I'm not sure of the ages of her children but when they meet your girlfriend she should be introduced as Grandpa's lady friend or special friend. They should call her by her first name, even if you marry her, given your history. This should solve most of these issues (unless there's something deeper going on here, which is entirely possible)", "YTA. Your \u201cwants me to be alone forever\u201d gripe is weak. That\u2019s not what she said. The issue is that she\u2019s sick of the revolving door of step-mothers/grandmothers and getting attached only to have them be gone a short time later. Nobody wants to deal with that. Sure, your son didn\u2019t express any issue with it, so not an AH for that part, but you seem a bit unaware that getting your gf involved with the grandkids at only 6mos in might not be the smartest move.", "YTA. \n\nYour argument is that if your daughter is uncomfortable with your girlfriend of 6 months being in photos/being introduced to kids that she must want you to be alone forever. You realize there is a whole world in between those two options. \n\nThe biggest indicator that your daughter is 100% right, is that after 3 divorces, you have \"finally\" found the love of your life after 6 months of dating. You don't think that maybe after getting it wrong 3 times, you want to take it slow?\n\nYa, I don't think your daughter gets to weigh in about photos you take with kids that aren't hers, but I think she is using this opportunity to tell you that what you do- change out women and make them family right away- isn't going to work for her when she has a baby. \n\nAnd you center the entire post and argument around your girlfriend and not wanting to be alone. There is no self reflection about how you have already gotten it wrong 3 times so might want to slow down, that you can be part of the family and not have your girlfriend around them, that you can talk to your kids about a timeline that works for them, or anything that notes how your actions impact anyone else.", "Yta for not getting it's not about you, she has a point about you seeming fickle.", "YTA.\n\nIf you keep meeting, hooking up and marrying new women it probably caused your children a lot of stress and embarrassment and they don't want the same for their children. \n\nYou could keep your relationships private as you obviously aren't really good at commitment so there is no need to be introducing every partner to your family.", "YTA. Firstly, never post a photo of a child without their parent's consent; just ask your son first. Also, your daughter is not saying you have to be alone, just that you shouldn't be pushing a family relationship between your girlfriend and grandkids, especially after only 6 months. You are welcome to have an adult relationship with anyone you choose, but your girlfriend does not need to be involved in family events yet if your kids aren't comfortable with her being around your grandkids. Your son only met your girlfriend what, 3-4 months ago, and already you are parading her around to your grandkids' special moments? The fact that your daughter is pushing back suggests maybe you are doing too much too soon with involving her in the family dynamic. That's YTA. The issue is not you having a girlfriend, it's likely just their comfort level with her involvement with their kids.", "YTA\n\nThis sounds like a classic case of an adult child seeing a revolving door of relationships and instability from her father and not wanting her own children to experience it for themselves. Your daughter also seems to feel like she\u2019s been second fiddle to some of your previous partners as well. \n\nIt can be harmful to introduce young children to a grandmother like figure and then have that person disappear from their lives without further explanation or contact. Your daughter is trying to protect the grandchildren from the instability you have inflicted on your children.", "I\u2019m going with YTA because when it comes to family photos, someone who may or may not still be in the family in 6 months can\u2019t be (easily) removed from the photo. Perfectly ok to post photo of you and gf, but let her take the family photo next time instead of being front and center.", "YTA for not realizing this isn\u2019t about these pics at all", "Gentle YTA. Of course you deserve to find happiness, however without knowing background it\u2019s not unreasonable for them to doubt if this relationship has long term potential. Maybe you\u2019ve been unlucky and precious divorces have been because your spouse was unfaithful or otherwise the primary reason the relationship failed, which might change my judgement. In the absence of anything indicating that\u2019s the case, of course they have concerns.\n\nChildren shouldn\u2019t have people introduced to them as new family members unless it is definitely for the long haul, and whatever you say about this particular woman, given that you have been divorced several times they can\u2019t be sure that it is long term. If your children are concerned this girlfriend might not be around that long in light of previous experience, then it is fair for them to want to protect their own kids from the confusion of changing family. It\u2019s not fair to leave those kids with the sense that family is unstable.", "YTA\n\nYou married and divorced 3 times. To your daughter, it's like a revolving door of a new relationship. 6 months is not a long time to be introducing to your grandkids that your girlfriend is \"grandma\" in some way.", "Your kids clearly have emotional trauma from you being in and out of relationships. For that reason they are protecting their own children from your instability. Your refusal to acknowledge that you have emotionally damaged your children, and subsequently your grandchildren, is what makes you the AH.", "4th marriage? Dude, it\u2019s no wonder your kids don\u2019t see you partners as permanent fixtures. At the rate you\u2019re going through women I\u2019d be waiting until you were married for at least 2-5 years before letting the grandkids meet her.\n\nI agree you deserve to find happiness\u2026just not that you should involve kids in your revolving line of grandmas.\n\nYTA.", "I wouldn't say you're an asshole, but your kids are right.", "\n\nBoth assholes.\n\nI wonder how \"I don't want you to bring another woman every X months to the kids\" Became \"I want you to stay single forever? \"\n\nAren't you a little bit self centered? \n\nThe point went way over your head. \n\nKids get attached and then it's over and doing that all over again isn't good for them (not saying you are doing it but it's obviously how she feels). \n\nOn her side, if the parents are fine with it, she shouldn't say a word. She should just speak for her and her family and there are other ways to bring it than just saying \"I don't want you to see my kid\".", "Yta. Dude \"I don't deserve to be alone forever\" is what people say after being single for years. Not less than a year.", "You sound exhausting. Try actually listening to your children and having a conversation instead of always taking everything to an exagerated narcissistic extreme.\n\n\"It's too soon\"\"So I have to be ALONE FOREVER? I can NEVER introduce a girlfriend to them FOREVER?\"\n\nWho in the actual fuck ever said that? It's difficult for children to constantly be introduced to new \"family members\" who disappear when the parents or grandparents break up with them. It's a responsible thing for parents to wait until relationships are more established before involving their kids. And it's up to the parents to decide for their kids, when they are ready to meet an adult - not up to their whiney childish parent who makes everything about him.\n\nLike honestly - no wonder you have so many divorces if this style of over-defensive exagerating woe-is-me is how you respond anytime you face a boundary.\n\nGrow up. YTA.  \n\n\n\\[Edit clarity\\]", "Soft YTA. You probably should have discussed comfortability levels with your children before making introductions and posting the pictures. I don't think you had bad intentions. That being said, it sounds like your adult children worry about someone coming in and out of the grandchildrens lives, and it's a valid concern.\n\nWishing you love and happiness regardless. You deserve to be in a loving relationship and I hope the new girlfriend can fulfill it.", "Info: how old is gf? I think I already know the answer but come on, tell us the truth.", "YTA\n\n\nYour daughter is telling you that when you did this to her, she found it hurtful and confusing. She doesn't want you to do it to the next generation also.\n\n\nInstead of putting yourself and your new squeeze before your family, how about listening to her and amending your behaviour so it's less hurtful to your family?", "Yeah, YTA. I mean... come on.", "ESH. Kids who aren't your daughter's aren't her business but she's obviously tired of having an endless supply of new mommies. You need to let her get comfortable with these women (and, like your daughter, I'm doubtful there won't be more women in the future) on her terms.", "YTA", "you should have asked you son but i think your kids dont accept your girlfriend in their life", "NAH - I can see both positions here. Speaking as a parent, I can see why your daughter has an issue with letting her children form a somewhat familial relationship with someone if there\u2019s a good chance that person isn\u2019t going to be around long. Your relationship history of 3 failed marriages isn\u2019t a particularly good one. And it sounds like your daughter has had a revolving door of stepmothers (and likely potential stepmothers) and she wants to protect her own children from that same revolving door. \n\nOn the other hand, nor should you be alone. \n\nThe picture thing is weird though- you\u2019re sending a message to the world that both you and your girlfriend are the grandparents to these children and that is not the case. Just because your son didn\u2019t say anything doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. The surest way to find out is to ask him. \n\nHowever, you can see your grandchildren without the presence of the current woman in your life and knowing your daughter\u2019s boundaries on this, you should respect her wishes. She doesn\u2019t have to introduce her children to anyone she doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nAlthough you would be TA if you\u2019re introducing your girlfriend as \u201cgrandma\u201d or insist they call her that.

You didn\u2019t seem to have bad intentions in taking pictures with them. It could be an opportunity to teach the kids about keeping a positive attitude. I had an uncle who was married several times and we loved most of them. It was kinda fun to have a different aunt each summer lol. My mom explained that sometimes things don\u2019t work out and called my uncle an eternal optimist. She would just tell us not to get too attached which again is a lesson kids need to learn eventually anyway. And being around family is a good way to get to know someone too. 6 months is a decent amount of time. This is just my own opinion. I think your daughter may have some of her own reservations and is projecting. Maybe you could benefit from a talk with her about her feelings? Either way though NTA.", "Your son didn't mind and, they're his children. \n\nShe's right to a degree. Introducing your grandchildren to someone you haven't even been with for even a year seems pretty shortsighted to me. \n\nESH.", "LOL at all the Y-T-A comments. YALL, THOSE KIDS AINT HER KIDS SO SHE CANTS SAY A THING \n\nNTA OP. Your daughter has no right to say anything about your post when neither she nor her children were in them. She disagrees with what you're doing and is keeping her distance which is fine for her. But she absolutely needs to shut her mouth when none of this was even about her.", "NTA.  If they were your son's kids and he didn't mind, your daughter's comments are completely out of line.  Posting pics of kids on social media can be a touchy subject--I know people who absolutely won't do it (I tend to be one), and others who post nothing else, but if your son didn't mind, then your daughter ought not.  (You really should ask before you do it, though.)  Especially since the hang-up seems to be about the GF anyway.  She likewise has no say in whether they she meet any GF or new wife you might have.  (You should probably check with your other children on that beforehand as well.)  Her own child is something else, though.  If she still feels the same way when her baby is born, you should honor her feelings when visiting her.  If she were to visit or join you in a family setting which she was not hosting (outings, performances, holidays, etc.), then you should be able to include whomever you want unless your other family also asks that you refrain.  Hopefully, she will come around to accepting you as you are and whoever else is important to you.", "NTA. The parent of your grandchildren did not have an issue with your posting the photos.

From what I'm gathering, the daughter is wary of OP taking pictures and making fb posts with the gf. That is a completely reasonable boundary if OP is going to create revolving grandmas in the family photo album. There's a difference between grandpa bringing a girlfriend with him somewhere, and him insisting on taking photos of her with the kids.  Some parents are adamant that nobody post pics of their kids, so I don't find this boundary to be highly unusual.
