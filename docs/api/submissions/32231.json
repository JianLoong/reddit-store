I think. Are you like at least helping your dad?

You didn't want to butt in, but you were there. Even though this woman is not your mom, you showed up to offer what support you could, as the stepdaughter.", "Feel like we are missing a lot of background info needed to judge. Info: How old are all of you? When did your dad meet his now wife? What happened to your mom and him? What was your relationship like with your dad and his new wife in past years?", "NTA. It's a tragic situation, but at the end of the day your life isn't solely about devoting all of your time to your step-mother. \n\n2 hour commutes aren't nothing. It's real time, in between all the other obligations of life. It sounds like your step-sister is just using you as a punching bag to project her (understandable but ultimately misplaced) anger over the tragic situation. \n\nTry not to let it get to you. People can become irrational when this kind of sad, tragic situation occurs. You have been pretty reasonable and you don't owe anyone an apology here. Capitulating would be unfair on you as you've not done anything wrong. It would give your step-sister the impression she can now bully you and personally I just wouldn't put up with it.", "Nta.

If you have the funds, maybe here a cleaning service once a month to give their place a good clean, it would take things off your dads plate.\n\nOh, get your dad an app for carers. It helps with keeping track of routines, medications,  Appointments, as well as including other family members and you can assign tasks to specific people like paper work or checking out a service or e en dropping of groceries or whatever. Kind of centralise the whole system , stop things from falling through the cracks.\n\nIm not really sure what it is step sister wants you to do? \n\nTry and figure out how to be supportive of your dad.", "NAH. People judging whose an AH here have to remember dementia is a condition she will die from. While it's a relatively peaceful way for the individual most of the time (at least compared to other ways), it's probably one of the most hurtful things for a family member to go through. It sounds like your step sister is under the impression you have a similar love for her mother as she does, so in her perspective you just don't care she's dying at all and seem to be completely separate from it.\n\nYeah, I've gotta say if my sibling behaved like that with out mother I'd also be upset and maybe say something similar. While your NTA for that because she's not your mother, I can see why she'd be upset too. Considering this was one conversation and she hasn't harassed you or anything after and it seemed to be something she said while really upset I'm not going to call her an asshole either. She did need the reminder though that your not her kid and don't have the same relationship to her.", "Nta", "I'm gonna say that you're the asshole because you contradicted yourself. Why would you feel the need to thank her for what she was doing if you didn't feel like you should be doing something?", "YTA - not in a huge way but for missing the bigger picture. Yes, it's not YOUR mom, it's theirs. But it is YOUR dad who now needs help with his wife. Is there anything you can do to make it easier for him or is he NOT your dad?", "I'm not sure what she expects you to do. You are absolutely right not to inject yourself into the decision making unless you are asked to share your thoughts.   \nI will say, though, that your father needs your support. Who's there for him? I speak from person experience, if I didn't have my son to support me I think I would have had a nervous breakdown myself. It's a horribly stressful to be responsible for the care of someone with dementia. My husband still knew everyone and was mostly able to care for himself. It was still difficult. Your stepsister is dealing with this first hand, cut her a little slack.  \nFor anyone who has a loved one suffering from dementia, I strongly recommend reading \"The 36 Hour Day\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In which case, absolutely NTA and it was a bit of a bloody nerve of them to expect you to be involved with organising and planning care for someone who, I presume, you only used to see occasionally. No wonder you reacted as you did!", "when I go over of course I help, I dont get to go over alot but I try to at least call him every other day", "Im 34, and my stepsisters are 36 and 38.  IDK for sure my stepmom's age but my dad is 71 and IK my stepmom is close to that.\n\nMy mom is still in the picture, she had main custody of me as a kid.  \n\nI got along with my stepmom alright.  Not the closest and I never really saw her as a parent but I respect her even as a kid I did", "TBH the more I kinda think about it I didnt really say a word when we were all there talking to my dad so maybe she's mad I seemed like I didn't care?  I really dont know", "It's not peaceful if you have to put a parent with dementia in a memory care facility.  My mother was very upset, didn't understand why she couldn't continue in her Assisted Living home, cried for months every time she saw us that she was scared of the other patients and wanted to come live with one of us. (Not possible without major renovations as she couldn't manage my stairs or get into Sister's only bathroom.)", "I thanked her for making my dad dinner too", "Okay then, yes, NTA, the only responsibility you have in this situation is if you are asked to help your father or if you feel inclined when you have free time for him. The only things steps can ask you for in this is can you run over to receive a grocery order or something small like that.", "[deleted]", "This is where you are missing the bigger picture.  Yeah, I get it, not your mom. But it is your dad's wife.  Do you care about him or the stress he's under now?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe isn't helping with YOUR mom either.", "Probably NAH, depending on your phrasing, but you could be a little more supportive. They're going through some shit right now. A better response would have been to have apologized and said you didn't want to overstep with things with their mom, as a stepdaughter. \n\nDespite not being an AH, you still owe your stepsister an apology. Do better next time.", "I guess you\u2019re NTA but I feel a little bad for your stepfamily. You\u2019ve been together since you all were kids and even if your bio mom was primary caregiver it seems from what you\u2019ve said that your stepsisters thought you were closer to them and to their mom. Or at least closer than you\u2019re coming off as. Showing and verbalizing such cold indifference, I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019re hurt and less than pleased by your attitude.\n\nAm I wrong with my assessment here? Perhaps it\u2019d do you and them good to sit down and have a conversation. Hear how they feel and explain in more detail your own feelings. That is, if the three of you have a relationship you find worth keeping. Sorry if I\u2019m making assumptions but we\u2019re working off limited info.", "NTA but you probably could be doing more. I think it was good that you let your stepsisters make the plans but your dad is most likely under a lot of stress. Especially, if your stepmother did tasks that he doesn't know how to do or didn't take care of previously. Your stepsister is likely doing things that are helping both her mother and your father. She's making meals and possibly cleaning and running errands. Things that benefit your father. He might go through something similar so I wouldn't plan on your stepsister helping if you aren't doing much now. Just somethings to keep in mind if you're thinking she would be a resource for your father in the future because she's closer. You're kind of setting the tone as \"not my parent not my problem.\" But truly make sure you're checking in with your father regularly and see what, if any kind of help he needs.", "NTA.  It's always best to establish boundaries immediately.  Better for them to be a bit upset now than to be counting on you (which they have no right to).  Would they be putting their lives on hold to help with YOUR mom?  I doubt it.", "Nta", "NTA", "Her mom had primary custody of her so, no, he's not really her dad in anything except the biological sense.", "She is not your mom. Your mom had primary custody and your dad didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why the step sisters expect you to care for their mom. Maybe try to help your dad out. But sounds like they want a caretaker and feel like you should bear the burden even though the step mom didn\u2019t raise you.", "Of course you don\u2019t care. She is not your mom. She is step mom and your mom is still alive and she had primary custody of you. Step mom is just someone who married your dad. Why would you be her caretaker ? Her lazy daughters should", "NAH. I understand letting your step sisters take the lead in care for your stepmother and discussing next steps. I don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s been in your life or what your relationship is like with her or your step sisters but your silence in the discussions reads like you don\u2019t care about her at all.\n\nEmphasis to your step sister that your step mother is not your mother was a bit harsh in my opinion.\n\nMaybe reach out to your step sister and explain that you didn\u2019t want to over take the previous discussion because you feel that their opinion should hold more weight since she is their mother.\n\nJust because she\u2019s your step mother doesn\u2019t mean that you should only support your dad. Assuming you have a good relationship with her and your step sisters, you can still find ways to support them all during this time.", "Yeah, I think you didn\u2019t handle it very compassionately or sensitively.  Sure, as she\u2019s not your mom it wouldn\u2019t really be your place to make suggestions in a discussion about her care, but you ought to have clarified those thoughts.  And in that phone call, wow you were a rude ahole, tbh.  If you want any sort of friendly relations with yr stepsisters I reckon you need to call her asap and calmly and with compassion have a convo clarifying what you \u2018meant\u2019.  It\u2019s a devastating diagnosis for them all, your behaviour seems like you don\u2019t care not your problem.\n\nAnd, from one who has been caring for a mum with alzhms for some years now - the thing is, the surrounding family members sort of suffer much more than the actual person with dementia.  Your dad needs help, or at least support.  Phone calls every other day are nice but actually going there sometimes and supporting/helping your dad - and stepmom - out would be much more helpful.  Dementia orgs  have a ton of resources and so on for family members & friends of those with memory-loss issues, I recommend you check them out, read up on some stuff, find out if your dad & step-mom are hooked up.  good luck!\n\nYTA  -  not for saying it, but for *the way you said it* \\- major AH.", "It\u2019s not your fault that your step sister interpreted your respect for the situation as indifference. It\u2019s not your fault she got offended first and didn\u2019t seek to understand your reasoning. You didn\u2019t want to overstep, felt it wasn\u2019t your place to contribute to that conversation as she\u2019s not your mom. She assumed that because you weren\u2019t saying anything you didn\u2019t give a shit. She could have asked and clarified. Or better yet, had a good faith opinion of you in the first place and not jumped straight to disrespect at all. She jumped to conclusions and hurt her own feelings.", "This info should be in the post. Step mom didn\u2019t even raise you as primary bio mom had the custody.", "Definitely add this info to your original post. This answers questions I had that are important context: when did SM enter your life, who had primary custody of you growing up, how much interaction did you have with step-family growing up and in adulthood, and how old are you all now? All very useful for the main post to mention.\n\nAs it stands, NAH. \n\nYour relationship isn't the same as your step-sisters, you're right to let them lead on their own mother's care, and you're right to support your dad. That doesn't necessarily mean you have zero role, but it sounds like no-one considered what role you might have played; that leaves you without any steer at the moment on what, if anything, you could do to help beyond what you're already doing.\n\nDo have some empathy for second step-sister. It does seem like she's shouldering the burden alone, given how far away her other sister lives. At least, that's probably how she's feeling. She must be very stressed and anxious right now. Does she perhaps feel guilty about only going once a week? It's not an excuse for her to lash out at you, but perhaps by helping your dad where you can, you can indirectly help ease the pressure on her a bit.", "Her bio mom had primary custody of her growing up. Step mom \u2018s kids have some nerve asking her to pitch in equal to them.", ">they may expect you to do more\n\nThey shouldn't. Her mom had primary custody of her as a kid. She owes her dad and his wife nothing.\n\nThat said, none of this is her stepsisters' fault and she *does* owe them kindness, human to human. Her words were unkind.", "I mean, should she? Her mom had primary custody. She doesn't owe her dad anything when he wasn't even an equal-time father."]}
