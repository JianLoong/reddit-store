I think. Are you like at least helping your dad? Like, sure, not your mom, but please tell me you've at least been helping take the load of his plate.", "What you did, what you said seems totally reasonable. You didn't want to butt in, but you were there. Even though this woman is not your mom, you showed up to offer what support you could, as the stepdaughter.", "Feel like we are missing a lot of background info needed to judge. Info: How old are all of you? When did your dad meet his now wife? What happened to your mom and him? What was your relationship like with your dad and his new wife in past years?", "NTA. It's a tragic situation, but at the end of the day your life isn't solely about devoting all of your time to your step-mother. \n\n2 hour commutes aren't nothing. It's real time, in between all the other obligations of life. It sounds like your step-sister is just using you as a punching bag to project her (understandable but ultimately misplaced) anger over the tragic situation. \n\nTry not to let it get to you. People can become irrational when this kind of sad, tragic situation occurs. You have been pretty reasonable and you don't owe anyone an apology here. Capitulating would be unfair on you as you've not done anything wrong. It would give your step-sister the impression she can now bully you and personally I just wouldn't put up with it.", "Nta. She lives 25 minutes away and only goes over once a week. Why would she think you'd be there a lot?\n\nIf you do want things to do to be helpful, maybe make some freezer meals regularly (dementia friendly /helpful) or have some delivered. If you have the funds, maybe here a cleaning service once a month to give their place a good clean, it would take things off your dads plate.\n\nOh, get your dad an app for carers. It helps with keeping track of routines, medications,  Appointments, as well as including other family members and you can assign tasks to specific people like paper work or checking out a service or e en dropping of groceries or whatever. Kind of centralise the whole system , stop things from falling through the cracks.\n\nIm not really sure what it is step sister wants you to do? \n\nTry and figure out how to be supportive of your dad.", "NAH. People judging whose an AH here have to remember dementia is a condition she will die from. While it's a relatively peaceful way for the individual most of the time (at least compared to other ways), it's probably one of the most hurtful things for a family member to go through. It sounds like your step sister is under the impression you have a similar love for her mother as she does, so in her perspective you just don't care she's dying at all and seem to be completely separate from it.\n\nYeah, I've gotta say if my sibling behaved like that with out mother I'd also be upset and maybe say something similar. While your NTA for that because she's not your mother, I can see why she'd be upset too. Considering this was one conversation and she hasn't harassed you or anything after and it seemed to be something she said while really upset I'm not going to call her an asshole either. She did need the reminder though that your not her kid and don't have the same relationship to her.", "Nta", "I'm gonna say that you're the asshole because you contradicted yourself. Why would you feel the need to thank her for what she was doing if you didn't feel like you should be doing something?", "YTA - not in a huge way but for missing the bigger picture. Yes, it's not YOUR mom, it's theirs. But it is YOUR dad who now needs help with his wife. Is there anything you can do to make it easier for him or is he NOT your dad?", "I'm not sure what she expects you to do. You are absolutely right not to inject yourself into the decision making unless you are asked to share your thoughts.   \nI will say, though, that your father needs your support. Who's there for him? I speak from person experience, if I didn't have my son to support me I think I would have had a nervous breakdown myself. It's a horribly stressful to be responsible for the care of someone with dementia. My husband still knew everyone and was mostly able to care for himself. It was still difficult. Your stepsister is dealing with this first hand, cut her a little slack.  \nFor anyone who has a loved one suffering from dementia, I strongly recommend reading \"The 36 Hour Day\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In which case, absolutely NTA and it was a bit of a bloody nerve of them to expect you to be involved with organising and planning care for someone who, I presume, you only used to see occasionally. No wonder you reacted as you did!", "when I go over of course I help, I dont get to go over alot but I try to at least call him every other day", "Im 34, and my stepsisters are 36 and 38.  IDK for sure my stepmom's age but my dad is 71 and IK my stepmom is close to that.\n\nMy mom is still in the picture, she had main custody of me as a kid.  \n\nI got along with my stepmom alright.  Not the closest and I never really saw her as a parent but I respect her even as a kid I did", "TBH the more I kinda think about it I didnt really say a word when we were all there talking to my dad so maybe she's mad I seemed like I didn't care?  I really dont know", "It's not peaceful if you have to put a parent with dementia in a memory care facility.  My mother was very upset, didn't understand why she couldn't continue in her Assisted Living home, cried for months every time she saw us that she was scared of the other patients and wanted to come live with one of us.

The only things steps can ask you for in this is can you run over to receive a grocery order or something small like that.", "Ok roughly how old were you when your stepmom came into your life? I think that you are correct in that you dont have as much of a say as her biological children as to what happens to her however as you have a good relationship with her and depending on how long she's been in your life they may expect you to do more. You mentioned that you talk to your dad.. do you talk to stepmom afterwards. She may enjoy some chats with you.", "This is where you are missing the bigger picture.  Yeah, I get it, not your mom. But it is your dad's wife.  Do you care about him or the stress he's under now?"]}
