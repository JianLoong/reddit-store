If I was living somewhere during a job where someone was fucking with the indoor temperature that much, I'd be calling the local labor board and reporting unsafe boarding conditions.", "NTA\n\nThere is no logical reason to have the heating on in these conditions.

When your work environment requires cooperation, a team member who is gleefully intentionally and continually screwing with his coworkers for his own entertainment is a problem.\n\nDan can wear a sweater and leave the thermostat at a level agreed to by the majority of his teammates. If feasible it might be helpful to group housing by who is sensitive to noise or who prefers warmer temperatures or similar preferences. (Dan however is taking it to an extreme and seems to enjoy the trouble it causes, so that won\u2019t fix this problem.)\n\nHas he been medically evaluated?

Dan needs to understand about teamwork, also is not only that he needs/likes the heat, but he clearly likes pranking, and that is not OK, specially at work.
