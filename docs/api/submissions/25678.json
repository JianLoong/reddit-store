We were watching this girl who was clearly a professional dancer, perhaps ballroom, just absolutely killing it on the dance floor. She was having the time of her life, dancing with different people, swirling and kicking, and at one point she even danced with one of the girls in my group. \n\nNext thing we know, it\u2019s the band\u2019s last song. We pack up, head out, and stop for pizza on the walk to the car. Behold, the ballroom dancer was there! We befriended her and her other friends, shared HUGE slices of pizza between us all, and got to know them. She was so sweet and we made some new friends. \n\nThe dancer all of a sudden said that she wanted to go home. It was like 2am so we didn\u2019t think much of it. We offered to walk her, but she insisted that she only lived like 3 blocks away. One of her friends in that group said that he would walk her home and assured us we didn\u2019t need to tag along.\n\nThe new friends invited us to a bar for a nightcap. Sam and I had stopped drinking at that point, but we said yes anyway because Kelsey and Damien really wanted to stay out. \n\nOn the walk to the night cap, we saw the dancer crying surrounded by cops. She was robbed at gun point on their walk home. I immediately stopped in my tracks and hugged her, asked if she was OK and offered her a ride home. She seemed remotely interested in the ride but was obviously preoccupied with the police. I wanted to wait with her until I knew for sure she was OK. Sam agreed with me and said she would wait too. Kelsey and Damien did not. They wanted to go to the bar and keep drinking. I said they could leave if they wanted but I was staying to make sure she was OK. They became dumbfounded, didn\u2019t say a word, and just plopped themselves down on the sidewalk and started pouting and whispering to eachother. They were pouting like THEY were the ones who got robbed\u2026.. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later they said they ordered an Uber (without consulting us). Then they cancelled it and ordered another one after I was obviously annoyed said \u201cok sure I guess y\u2019all can leave us, that\u2019s fine\u201d. They didn\u2019t even say goodbye. Sam and I got a ride to my car from the cops after that. I don\u2019t plan on hanging out with them again because of their lack of empathy. They were mad that I \u201cleft\u201d them, even though they ordered an Uber without telling us. I was more appalled that they didn\u2019t want to wait for this girl we were JUST hanging out with. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693180140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163662y/aita_for_being_mad_that_my_friend_didnt_want_to/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
