I would say they are the assholes\n\nIf something is making you uncomfortable and they are you supposed friends they should stop", "NTA. You\u2019ve never flaunted your family\u2019s financial situation or brought it up for discussion and it\u2019s really none of their business. I grew up middle class, I knew a few upper middle class families but mostly I was around other middle class people, lower middle class people and straight up poverty stricken people. We were always taught it\u2019s rude and tacky to discuss finances or ask other people about their wages. You shouldn\u2019t be exempt from that privacy because your family has money. \n\nYour friends may think \u201cthey would want everyone to know\u201d if they had money but I can guarantee that if that were the case they wouldn\u2019t want that or at the very least, it would get old quick. \n\nYou\u2019ve shared your fortune with your friends while remaining humble, such as bringing them to the beach house, and I am sure there are many more examples. If I were you I would continue to ask them not to discuss it and if they can\u2019t respect that then I would stop \u201csharing the wealth\u201d and distance myself. If you have a down to earth conversation about it and they continue to bring it up- they aren\u2019t real friends. \n\nYou\u2019re parents employment and wealth is nobody\u2019s business but theirs and their accountant at the very least (unless they are up to something illegal, then it might be the FBI\u2019s business too- totally joking). Good luck and hang in there.", "NTA what they are doing is rude and creepy.  It might be time to make some new friends  because at best they are stalkerish Aholes at worst they are golddiggers. The kind of people that would want others to know about their money are the kind of people that would use it to control/buy their relationships and expect you to do the same. \n\nBut if you do insist on dealing with these people maybe start googling their families and throw that back in their face. See how they like it. Not the negative stuff obviously just random info. \n\nOn a unrelated note if you need a new friend I love beach houses /s", "NTA. Its funny because a long time ago, people were taught that its rude to talk about people's wherewithal or openly inquire. It makes people uncomfortable, and it adds an element of competition into social settings that shouldn't be competitive.\n\nThis was considered gauche when I was growing up. Of course people are curious sometimes, but there is no need to cross others' boundaries.\n\n\"I never told anyone how much money my parents have because its THEIR money. I literally am supported by their money just like a lot of other people are supported by their parents' money. This is just awkward for me, its tedious as hell because you seem invested in being provocative? What friendship needs that? I'm not the only person you'll ever meet who asks you to respect their privacy about personal matters. Please knock it off.\" \n\nAnd if after time they don't appear to change, then consider getting some new friends? Friends usually grow together through inexperience and youth.", "NTA just cause they would want it doesn't mean you do. It's like if they wanted their balls stomped on. Doesn't mean everyone does.", "NTA. It's understandable that learning you have money would change your friends' perception of you, but bringing it up against your will is probably a bit much. They don't need to know/understand why it's uncomfortable for you, they just need to respect it and not bring it up.", "NTA, its good to see you've got your head screwed on right.", "NTA\n\nAnd how refreshing you\u2019re not flaunting your positive circumstance \n\nA lot of jealousy will be behind the comments, hold your head up high\n\nWhile you can\u2019t control being born into a fortunate situation, you can be humble\n\nYou\u2019re doing just that- keep your head up!", "NTA\n\nThere's no point in publicizing someone else's finances, it always ends up attracting the wrong type of people.", "NTA\n\n>and they just say \u201cwhy if I had money I would want everyone to know\u201d\n\nTell them, thats where they are wrong. YOU don't have money, your parents have. If they want to have wealthy friends, they need to befriend your parents, not you. As far as it concerns you, you are just an average joe at the moment.", "> other small things that never really occurred to me were signs that someone was wealthy\n\nAh the joy of being sheltered and able to call a brand new car at 16 and a college fund small...\n\n> to my beach house over the summer,\n\nLook.... It's hard to put a AH in this situation so i'm going to go NAH.\n\nThank god your friends are telling you loud and clear that you are privileged as fuck and you don't even realize it. Stop burying your head in the sand and acknowledge that yes, yes you got lucky and are privileged. \n\nYou are complaining that you are just 'one of the other poor kids', while being in the top % of wealth and that your friends should stop talking about it.\n\nWell they just uncovered why you never complained and struggled like 80% of the population did.\n\nSo it's normal they will be ribbing you for it for a while.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Drop these friends, good friends don't drag down their friends just to make themselves feel better.", "NTA for sure. You sound like a pretty decent person. Just say it is not your wealth, that it belongs to your parents, that you are forever grateful to them for sharing with you (because there are some parents who don\u2019t), that fortune can be fleeting - can easily change (has been known to happen). Their act of googling your family crossed boundaries - true friends don\u2019t do that - true friends express gratitude for having experienced your generosity.

Time to dump these mean spirited jerks and make new friends to replace them.

Wait until you really know someone before you take them there. NTA.", "NTA. You are being bullied.

And I remember him laughing one day and basically explaining, \"I am not even rock star adjacent. I am a student here trying to graduate just like you. The guy who owns the record company? Yeah. That's what I call rich.\"\n\nIt was a great bit of levity and delivered without rancor.  It made us all think about our ideas of what real wealth looks like too."]}
