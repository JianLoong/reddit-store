Perhaps the knowledge of your family wealth has upset the relationship dynamic and it is their feelings that are causing them to say these things.", "Next time it comes up, tell your friends that you\u2019ve always been warned to beware of anyone who seems too interested in your family\u2019s finances, because they would soon have their palms out. Then laugh it off - you think your family is just being paranoid. After all, none of your friends in high school ever tried to sponge off you, or treated you like anything but a friend. You\u2019re just uncomfortable because stalking your friends\u2019 parents is a little creepy.", "INFO: How long have they not known you were rich and how old are you and your friends? Cause If they just found out then expect some light ribbing for a bit till it dies down. But you will be known as the rich friend until you get a new label", "You need new friends. A friend finds out something is uncomfortable for you and they stop doing that thing.", "NTA.  Your friends are being AH's.  They will still be jealous of you though.", "My mother would yell at me \"Peasant!\" lol!\n\nAlso, I grew up with many wealthy families, but it's all degrees. Yes, people were on charitable boards, yes, kids went to colleges and didn't worry about the bill, most had second homes (it was more a thing then) - and the new cars for the teens was the flashy money, the old money drove the pinto or bug until graduation and then got the nice car.\n\nBut, the money never defined the people. They were kind or not. Friends or not. I can understand your discomfort, because they've learned these things and they are no longer appreciating you for the person you are and will grow into. And no, most kids from wealthy families don't flaunt it.\n\nI don't know how to fix it, but you are NTA", "NTA-\nThis kinda highlights the old money vs new money mentalities. Which is more stereotypical than anything. \nI\u2019ve met a few well off people, those whose wealth was generations old never really talked about it (unless they were spoiled to no degree) and those who only recently went into wealth communicated such by buying really fancy things- If someone wants to do that that\u2019s totally fine, but I\u2019m talking people whose closets are *only* designer or something like that. \n\nOverall: Not wanting to talk about your family\u2019s money is totally valid. What isn\u2019t okay is harassing your \u201cfriend\u201d when you find out they\u2019re rich. It\u2019s giving money hungry, that or they\u2019re *extremely* jealous and are taking it out on you. Which isn\u2019t fair at all. You deserve better than that. \n\nHonestly don\u2019t really seem like friends to me. I\u2019d drop them and find people who don\u2019t just see you as a means to get money.", "NAH but I get it. I grew up super poor and it took me a long time to not be jealous and project my own insecurities on my friends with money. On the flip side, people who grew up with money say the most flippant things without even realizing they\u2019re being rude. It\u2019s definitely more nuanced than that.", "Those are not your friends. Also, if your family's wealth is so easily found via a quick internet search, your family isn't doing enough/anything to mute their presence on SM, which should have been done long ago.\n\nNTA but you need new friends, to learn that families = multiple family vs. family's = my family and the topics and your family needs new advisors.", "They are NOT your friends.  NTA", "NTA and super weird of them to act that way. We did a weekend trip to a friends house in college. We had no idea how loaded her family was. She warned us on the ride so we weren\u2019t shocked at her house, and prob better she did. OP is a little clueless but didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

Ok, nice trip and we'll have a talk about it.  \nIn the conversation they talk about something they did, which for them is the most natural thing, but for me it is economically prohibitive...ok, and we continue with the talk naturally.  \nWhen your so-called friends talk about your economic level... nothing seems more ordinary and disrespectful to me, I am with my friends because I like them as people, some are family friends that we met before they were millionaires, others that I met through myself. work line  \nSeriously, your friends are stupid, so either get over it and then go back to acting normally, or you'll realize they're just a bunch of immature cretins.", "Honestly, you can tell them to cut the crap and the first time someone tries to use you as a piggybank you need to tell them no. What their reaction after that is will determine if the relationship is something you want.", "NTA. But, uh...hon, those aren't your friends.", "NTA but they might go out to eat and expect you to pay every time, or they might expect expensive gifts and \"loans\" that they'll refuse to repay. Say no.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, it is none of their business", "NTA for asking your friends to stop making you uncomfortable. But consider that being uncomfortable is fuel for growth. College is a time for comparing life experiences, learning how other people grew up and learning to see the world from different viewpoints. You likely don't yet realize how different your life is to other people's because of the wealth and privilege you experienced growing up. It's wonderful that you're humble about it, and I can understand not enjoying the constant conversations about it - but maybe don't shut your friends down entirely. There's lots to be learned about other people's experiences here. But it's very fair to remind your friends that you are just a person, and don't enjoy being judged for differences in experience.", "NTA. Eventually they might get over the idea.", "Your friends are poor (not all like that) but they were never taught how to hide their money and be humble. I won\u2019t be surprised if they used you to name drop or feel entitled to your money. \n\nYou need to do better to hide your money. Only show off if you need to, like in a investor meeting with reputable people.", "These aren\u2019t your fiends. Be careful.

Don\u2019t sound like friends to me", "NTA.  I don't think your friends are trying to be malicious.  Curious and nosy, yes.  Give it time and hopefully they will stop.  If not, find new friends.  :o/", "NTA however, you understand these people are not good friends right?", "That must be so hard having to deal with that! Oh my gosh, I couldn\u2019t imagine being annoyed I come from wealth. Personally I\u2019m very grateful I grew up so poor and never had to deal with that", "I mean I don't know that it's weird.

You wouldn't google the last name and see who their family is? Let's be real, almost anyone in this world would do that, and I can see going down a wiki rabbit hole if you find out your friend has this kind of background...\n\nUltimately though I think it comes down to the friend group - if OP participates in teasing of each other and its just now her time then she's just being over sensitive. But ultimately if it bothers her she needs to talk to her friends about why it bothers her and she can disconnect from them if their entire relationship is now one of bullying or trying to get free shit.", "The people who say that are 100% going to be the lottery winners that go bankrupt in 5 years, if addiction doesn't get to them first", "Grown people use the term bullied unironically? \ud83e\udd22", "It would not be unreasonable if OP's friends came from a poor background.", "personally i wouldn't - that all sounds like a stereotypical rich-but-not-famous family. i would think \"oh, they have the sort of money i will likely never see in my life\" but not \"they are probably noteworthy for something and i should google them up\". rich people are a dime a dozen.", "First time one of these happens OP needs to cut them dead. The rest will learn.", "Think of it as negging or guilt tripping to set up for pressuring to pay.", "Back in the 1960s and 1970s, you could buy vacation homes in many places for short money - it was cheaper than paying for vacations TBH. Later, with the rise in vacation rentals, people could afford second homes because they would rent it out at certain times when they weren't using it. It's still possible to find vacation homes for short money - you just have a longer drive and most beach properties have a higher cost compared to a mountain setting for example.", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201ccash rich\u201d and \u201cwealthy\u201d.

If the gap is too big, you also need to give them some time to \"adjust\" to the fact that despite the money, you are still you. It's different to find out your NW is 500k than if it's 100 million. Its also different if they're struggling to barely be above poverty line than if they're comfortable middle class. \nINFO2: how exactly did the \"i asked them to stop\" go? Were you assertive ,serious, and clear about why it's making you uncomfortable, or was it just a \"oh, stop it you guys lol\" sort of dropped line somewhere?  It seems to me you were taught to be quiet about money, not to be discreet about the money, and that means that you just don't know how to handle the conversation, which makes you uncomfortable,  and that's why you just want the topic dropped, but it also leaves your friends, who've probably never had a wealthy friend, clueless on the proper 'etiquette' to talk to you. \nSome people are quick to say \"get new friends\".
