I'm sure you're very aware of the stereotypical jokes directed at neurosurgeons\u2014they didn't just spring out of nowhere; they have some solid basis in reality. You need to make sure you're not completely neglecting your wife to fulfill your other (admittedly very rigorous and tiring) obligations. That being said, your wife needs to be more understanding of the fact that you're a FREAKING SURGEON and can't be at her beck and call the whole day. A happy medium exists, you two just need to find it.", "NTA\n\nSurface level this just sounds like every tiktok that goes on about different love languages... \n\nYou have a job to do. What would she do if your workplace/residence gave you a pager and had a 'no phones' policy while working restricting your access? Would you consider yourself the AH if this occurred?", "NTA.  If your wife cannot understand this now she won't understand this for your career.", "NTA.  My husband and I both have/had attention-demanding professions (I\u2019ve since become too disabled for work, hence, \u201chad\u201d), and both of us set our phones to not ring for important parts of the workday, since we didn\u2019t need to receive any other calls.  Both of us had/have schedules that change often enough that we\u2019d sometimes forget when the other was unavailable, so making ourselves unavailable was the smart choice. Your wife is ignoring the nature of your job in a way I\u2019d expect of someone half her age (or at least a decade younger).  It\u2019s immature and inappropriate.  She\u2019s harming your ability to do your job, and maybe even adding risk to patient lives.  She\u2019s really not leaving you a choice if she kept doing this after you explained why she couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u2026you did explain that this wasn\u2019t okay before you blocked her, right? Because if you skipped straight to blocking without telling her she needed to stop, then you\u2019re a little bit TA, too.", "NTA - I think it\u2019s fair to say it would be hard to find patients who want a doctor who\u2019ll bail on them because they\u2019re getting personal call like that. Especially if it\u2019s something as life threatening as a stroke. \n\nI am operating under the assumption you probably had a conversation that when you\u2019re at work she can\u2019t expect you\u2019ll always be able to pick up the phone. I\u2019m also operating under the additional assumption that she understands most doctors have to be on call and round on patients. \n\nAlso I believe there\u2019s a setting to silence all notifications from a specific contact.", "NTA. You're a *doctor*. She needs to learn to text.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou are at work and regardless of your occupation it isn't appropriate for her to call you multiple times just to say cute things. Those cute thing can be said via text and you can check them during breaks. Imo at your age she should understand that work time isn't a good time for personal calls unless it is an emergency.", "NTA.She needs to grow the hell up. My father was Chief of Staff, and my mother called him at the hospital maybe 5 times during his career. He would call everyday about 30 minutes before he left to come home. What is so pressing that she can't wait until you get home. People amaze me when they expect MD's to drop everything for some asinine reason.", "NTA: She shouldn\u2019t be calling you when you are working regardless. Especially in your line of work. If you aren\u2019t answering, she needs to understand that there is probably a good reason for that.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t seem to understand what you do or how inappropriate it is to constantly call someone when they\u2019re at work, calling you 9 times?! Unless there is some emergency it can wait.", "INFO: Since when has she been doing this? Have you tried to talk to her about this behaviour before and made it clear that you find it disruptive? If you blocked her out of the blue, it seems like an AH move to pull, but if you talked to her before, I wonder why she would keep doing it when you made it clear that it's disruptive behaviour.", "NTA in this situation, you should be able to put just her number on silent instead of blocking her. \nAlso, I understand you're more than busy, but regardless, sounds like you have to put some more effort into your relationship. Your wife's way of doing it isn't the way to go, but I'm sure there are other things you could do, even if it's just texts.", "INFO: have you ever told her that her calling you, while having such a high concentration job, can\u2019t be getting these types of calls?", "ESH\n\nI totally understand the context of your residency and the pernicious shit coming out of those tiktoks, but surely as grown ups in a marriage there should be the option of an open conversation. Something to the tune of: It's really nice to know that you're thinking of me while I'm at work, but could I call you when I get opportunities? I can't turn my phone or ringer off because I'm on call, but having you call in the middle of evaluating someone possibly having a stroke is really difficult to work through and looks unprofessional to my patients.", "NTA for blocking it while at work that one time, but you need to take time out of your busy day to talk to your wife, understand *her* situation as well, and come to an understanding how to go forward. Yes, your residency is important for your (plural) future, but it won't mean anything if there is no future for you together.", "They dont give u a work phone? Weird if this shit is so important. My wifes hospital the cnas have \u201cwork\u201d phones for patients", "YTA, talk to her about the situation rather than just blocking her. You\u2019re communication skills need work. Suggest texting rather than calls so it doesn\u2019t get in the way of doctor/emergency calls or maybe that if you don\u2019t answer a call to wait for you to call/text back. There are so many other options you could try before jumping to blocking your partner. You didn\u2019t treat her like a partner or equal more like an annoying scam spam caller.", "NTA.", "Honestly, NAH. \n\nAs another medical person, I know how crazy neurosurgical training program can be and how demanding it is even after u finish your training. But I can also see it from your wife's point of view. she misses you and wants you around and maybe she feel very distant from you and this was her way of trying to be a bit closer. I have seen too many surgeons with broken marriages, please have a proper sit down with your wife. This issue is bigger than just some disruptive phone calls.", "YTA. It\u2019s easy to communicate what you\u2019re uncomfortable with. Blocking is a really extreme measure to take against your WIFE who was doing nothing but trying to show she loves you more. DND modes on phones also have the option of allowing certain people to get through.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And maybe you send a quick one to her without her texting first, letting her know you are thinking about her. My SO sends things from Tenor, places like that when he is working overnight. It's great to wake up to sentiments like that.", "maybe try voice notes if you can so you can hear each others voices!", "Boundaries ... have to set them in order to provide expectations etc. She apparently needed to be told that you can't answer your phone while you're at work dealing with patients, doctors, etc. Don't know why she didn't already know that, but apparently....", "You need to talk to her and make an effort when you are with her. Think of quality over quantity.\nShe clearly feels disconnected from you and she is trying things to get the relationship better. And you don't show her that you feel the same.\n\nYou both need to talk. Work is important, but at the end of your days, what will you regret more? not having worked 1 more hour or spending time with people you love? I am not saying dump your career, I am saying your relationship is as important as your career. I understand this is a very difficult time, but I have seen people in situations similar to you that act like their career is way more important than everything else and expect their spouse to get it and be quiet or just let them rest, or whatever. She is telling you she feels neglected. Believe her, it is serious. I read somewhere that a relationship is like a plant on a pot, if you stop watering it, it dies.\n\nDon't you ever think of her during the day? Don't you want to stay with her? Don't you want her to be happy? Make a point of telling her what you feel and showing her too. Send her flowers, send her a text \"I love you\" here and there. If you have time call her. Don't expect her to come up with stuff. You need to take initiative or nothing will be enough. For her probably it feels like she is a second thought. But if you love her, there is no way you never think of her during the day and you don't want to make her happy. You just need to show her. You are a surgeon, you dedicate so much to learn something so hard, you need to put your mind at work on your relationship too. Dedicate some of your free time to think and work on your relationship. Stop being reactive, and be proactive. If you are more proactive she will probably feel more secure.", "I think commenter was saying to have a conversation before work. I saw you say on another comment thread that you haven\u2019t had a packed day in some time. Maybe you should have just told her before work started that day something like \u201clook from now on I can\u2019t be getting these types of calls.
