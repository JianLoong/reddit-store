I'm sure you're very aware of the stereotypical jokes directed at neurosurgeons\u2014they didn't just spring out of nowhere; they have some solid basis in reality. You need to make sure you're not completely neglecting your wife to fulfill your other (admittedly very rigorous and tiring) obligations.

Both of us had/have schedules that change often enough that we\u2019d sometimes forget when the other was unavailable, so making ourselves unavailable was the smart choice. Your wife is ignoring the nature of your job in a way I\u2019d expect of someone half her age (or at least a decade younger).  It\u2019s immature and inappropriate.  She\u2019s harming your ability to do your job, and maybe even adding risk to patient lives.  She\u2019s really not leaving you a choice if she kept doing this after you explained why she couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u2026you did explain that this wasn\u2019t okay before you blocked her, right?

I read somewhere that a relationship is like a plant on a pot, if you stop watering it, it dies.\n\nDon't you ever think of her during the day? Don't you want to stay with her? Don't you want her to be happy? Make a point of telling her what you feel and showing her too. Send her flowers, send her a text \"I love you\" here and there. If you have time call her. Don't expect her to come up with stuff. You need to take initiative or nothing will be enough. For her probably it feels like she is a second thought.

Given her behavior, I do not think she knows the things you think she knows, and you should fix that. (Including what you've described here as your mobile phone use-case while you are on call/rounds/etc.)\n* It is not obvious whether you have offered her an alternative to her preferred mode of showing affection (send a text, send an email, stick a note in your bag/lunch/whatever) with an agreement from you to receive and acknowledge that affection either at specific times or under specifically described circumstances when you are at liberty to do so.\n\nYou aren't exactly making an effort to meet her part way, here, and that's not a great way to treat your spouse. On the other hand, she's not exactly covering herself in glory by going straight for the insults without asking why you temporarily blocked her and listening to your (calm, reasonable) response.\n\nDon't skimp on the logistical details, either. When I was a newlywed, I understood that my spouse \"couldn't always use his phone\" because of the nature of his job. What I didn't understand, at first, was that he *wasn't allowed to have his phone on his person* during the workday, so expecting him to be able to occasionally check his phone like a normal office worker was unrealistic. Actually talk to each other. Your job means you don't spend a lot of time together right now, so good communication is going to be even more important for your marriage than the average.", "NTA- but clearly some communication from both sides is needed.

He did always call before coming home though.\n\nMy suggestions, not a licensed anything but as my family's go to \"I know your not a real therapist, therapist\" here and some good discussion points. Discuss and agree - not talk at/to!\n\n1. Together pick out a ring & text tone JUST for her, one that's appropriate for work but different enough so you know it's her.\n\n2. If you don't have a picture of her for the contact pick on with her so you can see her when she calls/ texts. \n\n3. Make the rule of texting first unless it is an emergency. (Even when I am at the store I text and ask if we need this or should I grab that and only call if no reply after several minutes. ) \nThat way she can send you the loving affirmations and you can enjoy them when you have time and not on a hurried call. \n\n4. VERY IMPORTANT - set time for you both. Seriously time gets away from you schedule it on your calendar and don't let things like but the shopping HAS to be done now get in the way. Go shopping together. If you're married then you're sharing your life, so share make time for each other. Couples whom don't talk won't grow together.\n\n5. This will take awhile, find what works for you. Calling when coming home worked for my dad he found out if we needed him to grab dinner or something for dinner in the way home, we knew when to expect him if we were going out or to have dinner ready. You could maybe call her when parking and talk when walking in, or (hands free) on the drive in/home to get in some personal time. What ever works for you.\n\n6. Enjoy each other and remember everyone makes mistakes. No one likes to be ignored or harassed it doesn't feel good but if you don't talk things over problems fester and compound.\n\nGood luck and I wish you many years of happiness.
