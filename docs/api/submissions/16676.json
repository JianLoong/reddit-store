Both of us had/have schedules that change often enough that we\u2019d sometimes forget when the other was unavailable, so making ourselves unavailable was the smart choice. Your wife is ignoring the nature of your job in a way I\u2019d expect of someone half her age (or at least a decade younger).  It\u2019s immature and inappropriate.  She\u2019s harming your ability to do your job, and maybe even adding risk to patient lives.

So yes, context matters, and in this context, it's a problem.", "Yeah no I\u2019ve done that today. Obviously the post was asking about this particular situation and judgement based on that", "Oh come on. You're telling me a full grown adult can't understand that calling someone multiple times while they're at work because of some stupid TikTok Relationship Test trend is super irritating and unnecessary?", "Plenty of people pay for and keep two phones for two purposes. It's far from uncommon or beyond the realms of being easily possible. \n\nI do agree that boundary pushing is a possible risk of this though.", "Isn't there phones with double simcard?", "It's not encouraging it. It's just simply not discouraging it. You're right it isn't healthy but the actual solution would probably be therapy etc. Something OP doesn't have the time to sort. Therefore, current best solution is to get her to do it in a way that won't affect OP.", "Plenty of people do not do it because their fully grown wife cannot stop calling them at work.", "You'll still have to pay for it. And seriously, *why should he have to do this*?", "By not discouraging it and getting an entirely separate phone for her to do this on, it's absolutely encouraging it.\n\nIf a child was breaking your stuff constantly, and you didn't tell them no but just bought stuff for them to break - is that encouraging them to keep doing the behavior?\n\nThe current best solution is for him to sit down with his partner and communicate his concerns and find a different connection point for her emotional needs that does not affect him. The second phone affects him.", "I'm saying that because you're calling the idea of it weird and drawing attention to the fact they'd have to pay for the phone. I'm saying it's not weird and that paying for it is no biggie. It happens. Yes I agree that it's not usually for this reason though.", "Using your analogy, no it isn't encouraging them. Yes you're allowing them to do it again, but you aren't actively encouraging them to do so. You aren't saying \"go ahead and break these\". \n\nThe second phone doesn't affect him. He just keeps it silent and out of mind for the day and then picks up what his wife has left on it once free.", "I'm calling her actions that would precipitate a second phone weird, not having a second phone. I'm calling him having to pay for a second phone and second phone line because of her actions weird, not having a second phone that you pay for.", "Ok, agree to disagree that getting a separate phone for her to continue her behavior more easily isn't actively encouraging it."]}
