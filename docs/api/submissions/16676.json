I'm sure you're very aware of the stereotypical jokes directed at neurosurgeons\u2014they didn't just spring out of nowhere; they have some solid basis in reality. You need to make sure you're not completely neglecting your wife to fulfill your other (admittedly very rigorous and tiring) obligations. That being said, your wife needs to be more understanding of the fact that you're a FREAKING SURGEON and can't be at her beck and call the whole day. A happy medium exists, you two just need to find it.", "NTA\n\nSurface level this just sounds like every tiktok that goes on about different love languages... \n\nYou have a job to do.

My husband and I both have/had attention-demanding professions (I\u2019ve since become too disabled for work, hence, \u201chad\u201d), and both of us set our phones to not ring for important parts of the workday, since we didn\u2019t need to receive any other calls.  Both of us had/have schedules that change often enough that we\u2019d sometimes forget when the other was unavailable, so making ourselves unavailable was the smart choice. Your wife is ignoring the nature of your job in a way I\u2019d expect of someone half her age (or at least a decade younger).  It\u2019s immature and inappropriate.  She\u2019s harming your ability to do your job, and maybe even adding risk to patient lives.  She\u2019s really not leaving you a choice if she kept doing this after you explained why she couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u2026you did explain that this wasn\u2019t okay before you blocked her, right?

Something to the tune of: It's really nice to know that you're thinking of me while I'm at work, but could I call you when I get opportunities? I can't turn my phone or ringer off because I'm on call, but having you call in the middle of evaluating someone possibly having a stroke is really difficult to work through and looks unprofessional to my patients.", "NTA for blocking it while at work that one time, but you need to take time out of your busy day to talk to your wife, understand *her* situation as well, and come to an understanding how to go forward.

I have seen too many surgeons with broken marriages, please have a proper sit down with your wife. This issue is bigger than just some disruptive phone calls.", "YTA. It\u2019s easy to communicate what you\u2019re uncomfortable with. Blocking is a really extreme measure to take against your WIFE who was doing nothing but trying to show she loves you more.

She is telling you she feels neglected. Believe her, it is serious. I read somewhere that a relationship is like a plant on a pot, if you stop watering it, it dies.\n\nDon't you ever think of her during the day? Don't you want to stay with her? Don't you want her to be happy? Make a point of telling her what you feel and showing her too. Send her flowers, send her a text \"I love you\" here and there. If you have time call her. Don't expect her to come up with stuff. You need to take initiative or nothing will be enough. For her probably it feels like she is a second thought. But if you love her, there is no way you never think of her during the day and you don't want to make her happy. You just need to show her. You are a surgeon, you dedicate so much to learn something so hard, you need to put your mind at work on your relationship too. Dedicate some of your free time to think and work on your relationship.
