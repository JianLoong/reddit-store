On his side, this includes his brother, SIL, their three kids, and his dad and dad\u2019s girlfriend. On my side this includes my sister, her husband, their son, and my parents. SIL has a single mother who doesn\u2019t have a lot of family and often is at their home (we know her well) who she asked to come with. We said yes because we didn\u2019t want her to be alone.\n\nNext, SIL and BIL asked if her mother\u2019s twin sister could also come. The twin sister does have her own family and kids, but prefers to stay in the same town I guess (her kids live an hour away). This isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve tried to impose extra people on us. The thing is, we both have aunts and uncles we would have loved to invite, but we didn\u2019t because 1) our house is small and can\u2019t fit everyone and 2) it\u2019s a LOT of working cooking for that many people. \n\nI kind of gave a hesitant response and said I would check with my husband (they called me directly to ask). They seemed a bit annoyed and started trying to say it\u2019s only one extra person. Yeah, but so would my aunt be an extra person, or my husband\u2019s godparents, all of whom were very close with (I\u2019ve only met the twin sister once briefly). I know that if we say no, they\u2019ll be super annoyed, but I also feel wrong saying yes. My husband is annoyed with them too but says he will leave the decision up to me.

We of course will understand if this means that your mom can't come so that she can spend the day with her sister, and we'll miss her, but Aunt simply can't come.\"\n\nReal talk - you only allowed SIL's mom b/c you didn't want her to be alone. They already played that card once; they don't get to play it again for Aunt when she and mom could have kept each other company quite well.", "This is actually 2 extra people they\u2019ve invited to your home. Who knows where it would end?  You were gracious with the first request and now they\u2019re just being obnoxious and taking advantage of your kindness. They have no business inviting anyone to your house!  Tell them with the addition of their first uninvited guest you\u2019re now at capacity and the guest list is closed. Or just flat out say no. They are way beyond the bounds of etiquette, family or not. If they\u2019re that annoyed, remind them they\u2019re welcome to set up, cook for and pay for their own party. Just not at your house. NTA.", "It's understandable that you want to keep the gathering manageable, especially considering the limited space and workload. Politely express these constraints to your SIL and BIL, emphasizing that you've already accommodated an additional guest. It's essential to communicate openly and consider your own boundaries for a stress-free holiday. You wouldn't be the asshole for prioritizing your comfort and capacity.", "NAH. They asked, you said no. If you like you can invite her to come for the day or a meal but not stay in your home.", "NTA. They've already added one more guest than you wish. Just say no. It's perfectly fine to have limits. It's not fine for them to give you grief for not having an unlimited guest list.", "NTA - they need to respect your home. They want everyone to come, then they can host.", "NTA.  I have a completely different opinion on this, but it's your house, your stress, your work in preparing the home and food.", "Who gets an invite and starts asking for extra people?\n\nNTA \n\nYou are free to say no t whoever you want.", "NTA.\nIt's your house. You invite who you want. That's 100% up to you. Period.", "NAH. They can ask, you can say *no sorry this is immediate family only, we've had to limit the guests already and it's too bad we don't have a huge house to get everyone together!*", "NAH.   One option could be that if the extra people came, the meal would need to be a potluck with everyone cooking.   It\u2019s far easier to squeeze a crowd into a small room than it is to magic a huge feast out of a small budget.", "NAH\n\nFirst, this is your husband\u2019s sister. It really feels like he should be dealing with his sister directly - especially when involves being the bad guy.\n\nWhile the SIL\u2019s mom\u2019s sister may have family, I assume they don\u2019t have the Christmas Eve dinner tradition so she\u2019ll be alone Christmas Eve, correct? Not really your problem as you don\u2019t really know her and - if it was actually a big deal - your SIL\u2019s mom could\u2019ve spent the evening with her. \n\nI don\u2019t really buy all this \u2018well, she would\u2019ve invited her kids next year\u2019 crappy excuses, but if that makes you feel better, embrace them. Sure, it would\u2019ve been nice to invite her and not really much extra work, but definitely your call. But, then again, it would\u2019ve been nice to invite your random widowed neighbor down the street too.\n\nThat said, Christmas Eve dinner is an intimate event to celebrate time with close family and, maybe, friends. While inviting effective strangers may be nice, it also dilutes the intimacy of the dinner. Especially Christmas time. Enjoy your wonderful dinner with your family and let your hubby deal with your SIL.", "NAH \n\nI personally think if a single extra body is going to tip this event into too many people, you were probably a poor choice to play host for (14?) people. However, it's still your home and your event. Do what you like. Not really AH territory.", "Why don\u2019t you ask your SIL to bring a couple of dishes?

I\u2019m almost worried they\u2019ll try to get the aunt\u2019s kids invited next.

They never really seem to appreciate when we host (which they don\u2019t do) and don\u2019t cook so they don\u2019t understand the work that goes into a traditional dinner. This was super helpful and validating - thank you!", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. I did try to explain some of that to them but I don\u2019t think they see things the same way. I will just have to hold the boundary anyways.", "Disagree. Give a polite \"no\" but never explain. Any explanation is an invitation for a debate. A flat no gives no traction for a debate.", "Which they don\u2019t host, or if they do on the rare occasion someone else needs to go and cook (they don\u2019t cook). We try to be good hosts with lots of food options, drinks, etc. so I guess I\u2019m just feeling under appreciated haha.", "Do you mean like if it was you the answer would be yes? Just not sure if I\u2019m being too harsh!", "Normally I would be fine with that, but this is kind of a traditional Christmas Eve dinner (my parents are from Europe) that we always do. This year we wanted to include my husband\u2019s family too. The other issue is that they contribute very little to potlucks in the past because they don\u2019t cook - they usually show up with cookies they pick up on the way or something, which doesn\u2019t help much with the actual meal", "Oh god  no- they might bring a green bean casserole\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude02", "That's why I'd tell them you don't have the space for more, but you understand not wanting to leave family alone for the holidays! So if they feel they need to bow out and spend the evening with mom and aunt instead, you'll completely understand.", "Your husband is a disappointment. Tell him that he needs to tell his family \"no\" and that he needs to own that decision. In other words, he cannot throw you under the bus. He's a wuss.", "Please look at my post history. I opted out of cooking for thanksgiving this year for that exact same reason.", "I host a super relaxed Christmas.  The dress code is PJs, leggings, sweats, jeans...whatever people are the most comfy in.  I cook all of the mains and a few sides, people can bring whatever they want as a side or dessert (just no peanuts - we have like 5 peanut/nut allergy people).  I don't care if the food doesn't match or go together.   Last year, one of my cousins brought cole slaw and MYGOD, it was the greatest cole slaw of all time.  Anyway, we eat all day, relax, play silly board games and the more the merrier.  Anyone can sleep here if they want.  I have sofas and air mattresses.  This is just kind of how I roll through life, to be honest.  My house can be bursting at the seems and that's fine with me.  My dining room table doesn't have enough room for all of us and that's cool too.  Everyone fixes a plate (or five) and just shoves in wherever there is room, sometimes on the sofa.  But again, this is just really how I view everything.  \n\nThat said, your way is not wrong either.  There is no wrong.  You have to do what you are comfortable with.", "IMHO, there are few things worse than supermarket baked goods at a potluck.   If you don't want to make an effort, just don't come.", "Nooo. Right to jail for that.", "Or Iranian yogurt", "I hope I get to be like this one day!!", "The first time I saw one - I had no idea what it was. Slime with bits. Ugh."]}
