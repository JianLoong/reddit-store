This is a huge privacy concern with the potential for widespread negative impact. \n\nLaw enforcement can, as other people noted elsewhere, use that to track and find people through relatives. Which is not okay with the current lack of regulations- any violation of privacy by the law should be heavily regulated and monitored so that it is not abused. It can also be traumatizing to people who are being tracked down by the law simply because they're related to someone suspected of a crime. \n\nThinking past that, as we learn more about genetic correlates of mental health and behavior/traits, all this basically unprotected data leaves the door open to huge risk of stigmatization and biases against people merely for having risk factors for mental illnesses or behaviors - for instance, someone could be discriminated against because they have a genetic predisposition towards addiction even if they've never had any indications or instances of substance abuse in their life. \n\nThat data could also be sold to be mined and used for everything from unregulated science experiments to targeted ads based on your health risks. Imagine, for instance, deciding you don't want to know if you will develop Huntington's disease (when you have a parent with it) and then being bombarded by ads around dealing with HD. (Obviously that's an extreme example, but you could do the same with Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancers, etc...) \n\n If you're curious and want to learn more, look into bioethics studies and classes.

NTA", "NTA - either she\u2019s scared some unknown relatives could pop up in your life or she committed a crime and doesn\u2019t want her dna out there. It\u2019s probably the former, but the latter would be more interesting.", "What crime did she commit that she\u2019s afraid of any DNA left behind being traced back by your close sample", "nta\n\nFYI, if she's your half sister, chances are you share about \\~25% on average of your dna anyways (full blooded siblings are usually about 50%)... making you potentially nearly the same as your cousin genetically (assuming cousin's parent is a full-blooded sibling)... So, yeah, there isn't really *that* much difference between your profile and your cousins in that regard.", "NAH. Your sister has a right to be upset. From what I can recall, these companies own rights to your DNA sample which spills over to her because of similar DNA. At this point it's too late.", "I very much doubt that you deleting your account will solve the actual problem here which is a commercial venture has a copy of your DNA.  They probably legally can keep that information so that ship has sailed.\n\nNAH.  There is nothing wrong with your sister wanting privacy; her request is not strange.  There is also nothing wrong with you wanting to explore your heirtage.  Unfortunately she is just going to have to accept that.", "NTA but those tests are slippery slopes. My MIL found out there was incest in their family from it \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "Yeah, that's what got me, the half sister sounds controlling cause her argument doesn't add up. There has to be something the half sister is hiding that would explain her reaction. OP, don't delete your account unless YOU want to. It's YOUR DNA profile, not hers, and if she won't drop it politely, point out that she doesn't own your DNA you do.", "NTA, it's not going to change anything if you remove your account. They have your DNA and that's not going to be thrown out. Send her an article to read. I did mine and I have like 5k people in some what related to lol.", "NAH it does seem strange at first until you realise a company just has access to your entire genetic make-up and can basically do whatever the heck they want with it, because there is no ironclad legislation. Have you read who they share your data with exactly? What you have consented to?\n\nThey could sell it to insurance companies who could then use the information about genetic illness to claim you are a liability and not worth the money, so they won't take you. You are not protected under HIPAA when you give up your genetic code.\n\nLaw enforcement could pressure the companies to release your DNA for Investigations.\n\nObviously hackers stealing your data is also a problem that has happened before.\n\nAll of this is massively problematic for various reasons and I understand completely how someone does not want to have part of their genetic code entered into a database like that.", "She might actually be on interpols shortlist and afraid of discovery", "The problem is more the dark potential for health insurance companies to buy this data on the future and use your genetic information to adjust your premiums based on risk. It's currently illegal but it may not always be..."]}
