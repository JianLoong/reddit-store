My sister got super upset and told me I should remove my account because it was also her DNA and she didn\u2019t feel comfortable having it online. I was really surprised, and when I tried to protest she said that it\u2019s like posting a picture on social media with her in it without asking her.

Unfortunately none of us have any possibility of consent in these cases if a relative decides as you did.

What I mean by similar %, is for the Ethnicity results by country/area of origin as it is done in myheritage.. but yes, the DNA will then show only 25% of similar ethnicity but nothing about who she is down the road.. unless she does the test or someone enter her info in the family tree..", "Ohhh poor thing! but good laugh... Guess they are not aware of how DNA works.. also if twin, you and cousin are like half-sis/bro... Kind of fun :)", "Thank you!", "DNA tests make people nervous for a lot of reasons. Police use those services to find criminals, families have been torn apart because infidelities have been discovered, truths about who a child\u2019s parents *actually* are come to light.

I dont get to control anyone else. NTA", "NAH\n\nbut you gotta also understand that these dna companies are using your dna to pilfer information about you and your family.  Its understandable.\n\nI myself would like to take one but I wouldn't want a bunch of my family dragged into that invasive ecosystem where the info is extracted, sold, and analyzed by companies.  I also wouldn't like it it if others did it and I was flagged/dragged into anything because someone else willingly paid and gave up their dna info to these companies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIts an intriguing situation.  Sadly, these companies are shaaaaady as fuck", "The way our own personal information is used against us in this day and age makes it very reasonable to be scared of your DNA being in the hands of private companies. You aren\u2019t an asshole for doing what you want with your body, but I think your sister has very valid concerns and personally I believe the right thing would be to delete the account. This isn\u2019t a thing strong enough to deem someone an asshole about it, so NAH, but I think you should respect her wishes in this.", "NTA. Like some are saying on here, either she's worried about a connection being made with another sibling....\n\n....Or she's got a secret kid out there she doesn't want finding her.", "NTA. It is frankly none of her business. Your DNA isn't her DNA, and she should just butt out.", "Because of the edit, I was torn between N-AH, but since that's just a guess I'm going NTA. If that is the case, she should speak up. I understand that can be nerve wracking. I know my dad took one of those tests because he does have a half sibling he's never met out there (he knows his dad cheated and got a woman pregnant, but that he cut the mom and the baby out to save his marriage). And I never met my biodad, so I kinda took the test to see if I have any half siblings out there I don't know about. So with us doing it to maybe find lost blood relations, I get if she's worried about the same thing. (LOL and I admit I don't look like the ethnicity my mom told me I was, so I wanted to confirm. She didn't lie, I just don't look it at all)", "Keep your MyHeritage I used Genomelink to get a deep dive. I found East Asian, Northern Africa, Native American, and even 1.98 Neanderthal.

Yes, you both have your rights to fulfill your needs. There's a chance that your discoveries will hurt your sister. Because you're dealing with dna, that means the answers are people, who can choose to leave her life or be relatives that she regrets the day you matched with them.", "NTA. My half sibling and I both did the same DNA test and we only share 17% of our DNA. So no, your DNA is not hers and likely isn\u2019t even close.", "NTA but this is a really cool video that you should watch on genetics and how sharing data is a complicated concept in today's world https://youtu.be/KT18KJouHWg", "NTA - It's fun to learn more about your familial past and history, but from personal experience it can bring up secrets from the past that no one may be aware of.

But your sister is clearly hiding/worried about something.", "This. As an American with zero guaranteed health rights, we don't know how this information will be used in the future.

I am not typically a conspiracy theory kinda person and even as I type this it sounds a little paranoid but thems the facts.", "It's a half sibling so they will share on average 25% of their DNA, with a theoretical maximum of 50%. Even if OP's DNA were fully sequenced (which I assume these tests don't do?) there would be no way to know what specific genes they shared.\n\nYou're right, though, that we're heading towards a dystopian situation wrt how genetic data is going to be used...", "I wouldn't willingly hand my DNA over either, but if I had a sibling who chose to do so, I wouldn't demand they remove it either.\n\nI've previously spoken to a parental unit who expressed interest in doing one themselves, and explained why I thought it was a bad idea, but it's their choice as to whether they ultimately do so or not. We might share 50% DNA but they have their own mind, and I can't tell adults what to do with their OWN DNA.\n\nNor would I tell my adult children whether they could or could not - all I can do is advise, or offer the reasons for my hesitation, and then accept their decision.", "You\u2019re right that people don\u2019t like their genetic info falling into the wrong hands, [but seeing these wastes of humanity get their just desserts is incredibly satisfying.](https://www.toptenz.net/10-crimes-solved-by-dna-ancestry-companies.php) So the paranoia might be called for, NTA though, you own your own genes, for now anyway.", "Going off of relative DNA would be improper for insurance companies to do. Can you link any reputable sources that show they are doing this? To give an example, no one in my family had any history of heart issues. At least going back 3 generations. However I have a heart defect that causes severe arrhythmia that I have to control via medication or surgery. None of my siblings had this issue at all. (1 full sibling, 5 half siblings). Same with any cousins on either side. For an insurance company to raise rates because of affiliation is pure speculation.", "You don't have to be a criminal to be against certain things.", "Which is what makes her argument so strange... as cousins also share about 25%.", "Yes but even then from one direct sibling to another the dna can vary greatly. I look considerably different from my brother so our DNA will be different. \n\nIt\u2019s still a ridiculous thing for the half sister to say because it\u2019s just not the same but closest this argument gets to valid is with identical twins.", "This is what I was thinking as well. She has a kid out there that no one knows about and is worried OP will match with her nibbling.", "Yeah because insurance companies always do what is proper.", "Yeah because an insurance company would never do anything improper or shady to avoid paying out and they certainly would advertise that they do.", "If cousins and grandparents are also in the system, then it doesn\u2019t matter if you are as well, unless it\u2019s from the other side of the family as this sister. And deleting your account might not delete your DNA information. \n\nI understand not wanting your DNA in the system, but it is safe to assume that a family member will eventually get a DNA test done. These things are too popular.", "Law enforcement only has access if you upload your results to GEDCOM, I believe...", "At least that's what they want you to believe. I suspect that if they get a court order they would have full access to anything and everything.", "No they can ask the companies to search their database.. \n\nThey've done it a couple of times. It's part of the cooperation stuff they don't like to talk about with tech.", "This is correct. Genetic material can be subpoenaed like any other medical record."]}
