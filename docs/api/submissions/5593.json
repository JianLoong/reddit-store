When I joined, it immediately gave me a notification and showed me my cousin (from my dad\u2019s side), who had apparently done it a few years earlier. Last year both my two maternal grandparents got the tests for their anniversary and also did it. This was even cooler because I could see how much I am related to each of them etc. Since then I\u2019ve been trying to convince my dad to do it as well.\n\nThe other day my sister (22F) and me were sitting at her cousins house (23F) and I brought up the test. My sister got super upset and told me I should remove my account because it was also her DNA and she didn\u2019t feel comfortable having it online. I was really surprised, and when I tried to protest she said that it\u2019s like posting a picture on social media with her in it without asking her.

It's not impossible that your data gets shared with an insurance company and suddenly your premiums go up because you have a gene related to a congenital disease. I could paint more lurid pictures involving refused mortgages or jobs or racist nutters tracking down the unclean. None of that is happening now but it is certainly possible using this technology.

Also, some people just like their privacy.", "NAH \n\nYes, it is your DNA and you have right to do with it what you will. But she is also right that as you are related by extention you have submitted that genetic material too against her will. Unfortunately none of us have any possibility of consent in these cases if a relative decides as you did. Keep in mind that hypthetically your DNA also contains the medical data of your relatives.\n\nThis is an interesting moral dilemma. You are not at fault for wanting answers or just being curios and she is not at fault for not wanting part of her DNA to be shared and sold for a tiny amount without her consent.\n\nNobody really knows what will be done with that gathered information and how good or bad it will be used for. Maybe cure for cancer or maybe restricting access to heath insurance as you might have a potential for chronic illnesses.", "NTA.  Your sister could use a refresher science course on DNA though.", "There are very legitimate fears about DNA data online, a lot of health insurance companies pay to get it to raise premiums in their customers. NAH but take it down.", "NTA. Maybe look up their policy on information about relatives who aren\u2019t on the website, and share them with her and ask about the parts that make her uncomfortable.

Therefore unless she does her own test she is not listed as having that dna.   \n\n\nnta. You paid for that test. It\u2019s your info to do with what you like.  Unless you are twins her dna is different anyway", "NTA. You don\u2019t need her permission, nor should you wonder if you\u2019re TA in this situation.

I know it makes some people uneasy, for various reasons, but that doesn't give them the right to tell adult family members whether to do it or not.", "NTA, unless you are twins from the same egg (forgot the correct name) , your DNA is your and unique.

What I mean by similar %, is for the Ethnicity results by country/area of origin as it is done in myheritage.. but yes, the DNA will then show only 25% of similar ethnicity but nothing about who she is down the road.. unless she does the test or someone enter her info in the family tree..", "Ohhh poor thing! but good laugh... Guess they are not aware of how DNA works.. also if twin, you and cousin are like half-sis/bro... Kind of fun :)", "Thank you!"]}
