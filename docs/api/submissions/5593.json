If she's freaked out, she's freaked out. But her analogy is very flawed. You having a profile when your DNA only overlaps with hers by 12% is not nearly the same as you posting a picture of her without her consent.  \nThis is like you posting \"I have a cousin who lives in X city in Y country\" and her accusing you of doxing her. Posting her city and country is not the same as posting her name and address. You having a profile with your DNA is not nearly the same as sharing her DNA online.  \nBoth are examples of you sharing personally identifiable information that could make it easier for other people to find her, but her desire for privacy only applies to her DNA sequence, not yours.

However, most full siblings only share about 50% DNA because you inherit different things from each parent. My brother and I only match 43%. So the amount you share is probably more around 25%.

Additionally the test company cannot sell the data to health insurers (but depending on the state could sell it to their other corporations or other types of insurance besides health insurers like life and disability insurance, which is obviously bad) \n\nWhat can, and does happen, is that people get their results, and depending on their results they will consult a doctor.
