Have you tried talking to this girl at all? If you got to know her a bit on a human level, this will make you see that she is a child just like you. I'm sure she's extremely self conscious about her scarring too. Also how can you be sure that now you have moved classes, the dreams will stop? If you are worried that you are being victimized by fully grown adults (teachers) you need to speak to your parents and your head teacher.", "Your teachers should not be targeting you, even if you were ableist. It's not right for a grown adult in a position of power to target a child. \n\nYour feelings that Jane isn't human can probably be solved by getting to know her as a person, or getting to know other people with facial issues. I suggest Special Books For Special Kids on YouTube, which is a channel that does interviews with people, adults and kids, with different deformities, disorders, and conditions. \n\nPeople with facial deformities are not scary or inhuman. Seeing that may help you not have nightmares about people who are just like you and I.\n\nYour teachers should not be targeting you for any reason, even if you may have come off as ableist. If you do take this to parents or headteacher, be sure to explain why you wanted the switch.", "YTA\n\nThe solution here isn't to stick a plaster over the issue by moving classes and hiding, but to figure out and solve the underlaying issue.\n\nIt sounds like you need professional help from an appropriate therapist or psychologist to help diagnose the issue and find the solution to help you out.", "Sorry but YTA (I know you are young, reason why the sorry) likewise your teachers are assholes for bullying you.\n\nWe all have things that could make us uncomfortable, we really can't control our feelings. But what we can control is how we act on them. If everyone followed their feelings even the not so great ones, especially when it revolves around not wanting to be close to someone else because of a physical attributes, what do you think will happen?\n\nYou should always try to find evidence for the feelings you have when irrational.

Your teacher's reaction was disgusting and unprofessional but (despite your young age) you really are also YTA.", "YTA. You could have tried talking to Jane, to get to know her and see that she is human just like the rest of us. Maybe she is a very nice girl with some major insecurities, which you are now adding to because if teachers know about this, then other people at school likely do to. If it turned out that Jane was not a nice person after you started talking to her, then you would have a legit reason to give your counselor for switching classes. Either way, you would see that she is a person and not a monster.", "Your teachers absolutely suck and are disgusting people. You are a child, you do not deserve adults bullying you.

Nothing Jane can do about her appearance, but there\u2019s a lot you can do to change your attitude. Jane is no different than you. \n\nI\u2019m also a teacher, and would have talked to you about your shallow excuse for swapping classes too. I wouldn\u2019t have swapped you to another class. Get to know Jane and accept her for who she is. Grow up.", "YTA. Do you think Jane wouldn't know why you moved classes or how you act around her?\nI'm trying to be gentle because you're very young but how you act now will play a huge part in Jane's life.\nShe's likely already going through so much and hyperaware of how other people perceive her. Doing something as hurtful as this would stick with her for life.\nTry sitting and talking to her. I think that would help with your nightmares and also help her.

As someone who has extremely prominent body markings from a birth defect, I can assure you that Jane is hyperaware of why you are switching class. People with scarring or birth defects aren\u2019t monsters and your behavior is incredibly concerning.\n\nAlso, the fact your consular and teachers reacted like this makes me suspicious that you are actually bullying her and they didn\u2019t know who it was until you approached them.", "Very soft YTA. I can understand why you think your reaction is appropriate if you're being truthful about the nightmares etc and being impacted so deeply.. however, you need to humanise people with facial disfigurements, not run away from them. \nDo you have any good and wise friend to confide in? Sibling? Parent? Could you maybe go back to that school counsellor? You really need to keep talking about this. The way your teachers have responded irritates me no end, because they should be educating you, not punishing you.", "Soft YTA. I do wonder if the teachers are picking on you or does it just feel like that? If they are insulting you start a diary of what they say and when they say it. \n\nI think the other thing to have done is speak to a parent or guardian and ask about counselling as there is possibly something else going on that is manifesting itself in this fear of a classmate", "YTA. Poor 'Jane'.", "NTA. You didn't bully Jane or treat her badly, and if you had talked about your issue with a therapist that would be totally normal. You talked to a school counselor and not only did they fail to counsel you they also didn't respect any form of confidentiality or privacy and shared what you told them with other teachers. And the teachers bullying you is not ok either.\nI suggest you talk to your parents about all of this if you haven't already.", "You already know the answer to your question when you said you were a bad person. \n\nIt is horrible and ableist to request to be separated from someone with a disability. You\u2019re blaming this person, who was the victim in an accident, for your grades dropping. Your grades are something you have control over. \n\nIt\u2019s time for you to seek out therapy. Like actual, real therapy to deal with your issues\u2026and it just checking in with a guidance counselor.\n\nYou\u2019re going to meet a lot of people in life- you\u2019re going to have to learn how to work with everyone, regardless of their physical presentation and abilities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your school counsellor is not cut out for that kind of work. \n\nI hope that doesn\u2019t prevent you from seeking therapy if you ever need it in the future - any self respecting mental health professional will be able to hear anything you\u2019ve got to say without judgement and would NEVER yell or lose their cool with you. \n\n\nMy advice is try not to be too hard on yourself.

Also, you're aware that this is a problem, and that you feel bad for feeling this way. That makes me think that you aren't a bad person. The comments here being completely awful to you are uncalled for.\n\nI think you need to talk to someone about this, a therapist or a counselor. Someone who can help you figure out why you keep having nightmares about another kid's deformity. Maybe a part of you is scared of her, or scared of that ever happening to you. It's definitely a psychological problem that you need to get help with, before this affects your adult life as well.\n\nOn another note, your teachers are being bullies to you. That is unacceptable, they are full grown adults, they should know better. I would suggest bringing that up with your parents/guardian, so they can handle that for you. It is unacceptable behavior from them, and you don't deserve that.\n\nI wish you luck hun", "To some extent, Y.T.A. But your school counselor is a bigger one. Instead of telling you that you're an awful person, she should have talked with you about why discrimination against people with disabilities is a huge issue, and how to deal with unrealistic fears that are resulting in nightmares. She should have called in your parents and consulted with them about you seeing a therapist who could help you figure out what is at the root of those fears, and how you can learn to manage them and eventually move past them, because it isn't feasible for you to avoid people whose faces or bodies make you uncomfortable for the rest of your life. Also, recurring and persistent nightmares is a pretty solid sign of anxiety or other mental health issues, and I think it's pretty likely that your fear/dislike of your classmate is just a displacement of the actual source of your anxiety, or is an intrusive thought that comes through your mental barriers specifically because you know it's not a kind or appropriate opinion to have, and that's the way intrusive thoughts work. The school counselor should also not have told your teachers why you changed classes, and the teachers should not have responded by persecuting you (if indeed they are, and you aren't perceiving their behaviour in an exaggerated way because of the anxiety again).\n\nLong story short: it isn't reasonable for any student to ask to switch classes because the appearance of another student bothers them. But the fact that you know that on some level and ended up at the point where you were so distressed that you did it anyway suggests that there are bigger issues here.

I have a horrible feeling that this either already has or will get back to Jane soon enough.  \nIt's possible that you're picking up on things the teachers aren't intentionally doing, or they are, or they're not at all, I can't for certain help with that.  \nI wish I could.\n\nThe fact that you understand that your dreams are not her fault are great, it shows a decent level of mature understanding. It's also highly probable that the more your grades slipped, the more you subconsciously started mentally linking Jane to your failure. Which would have made everything worse, a vicious cycle, if you will.\n\nBy the sounds of it, Jane probably doesn't have a huge amount of friends, possibly because people get embarrassed and don't know what to say or she's shy. She may have been just as shy before the accident, she may not, but I've no doubt it hasn't helped her.\n\nI know she scares you, but it could be worth speaking to her, trying to find some common ground, so you can set your mind at ease, and calm down that bit of your brain that puts hands under the bed.\n\nYou're not a bad person, having experienced years of bullying for being too tall, too thin, too quiet, too...me, it was refreshing when I found some friends that accepted me for who I was.

It also makes it worse that obviously this isn't something you feel you can tell people about, so you're just bottling it all up and that's making things even worse. If seeking outside therapy is an option, that would be a great way to talk this through with someone.\n\nHaving the nightmares and anxiety does not make you a bad person. But it is something you should probably seek support with instead of just running away from it, which is part of why it fucking sucks that your counsellor was so awful to you about it.\n\nI would send an email to your counsellor with the information you've written here (ie, that the anxiety and nightmares have been affecting your sleep and academic performance, and you absolutely know it's not Jane's fault but you couldn't cope and didn't know what else to do except switch classes).

As far as my experience goes, most (if not all) people are ableist on some level, but even the ones that refuse to acknowledge this or are intentionally cruel don\u2019t have literal nightmares about disabled people that affect their waking lives. This is more likely a deeper psychological issue and your brain, unfortunately, latched onto Jane when manifesting symptoms. It\u2019s not really your fault. Sometimes, brains are just assholes. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that the adults around you are failing you. I hope you find a safe counselor or therapist to help you work through this issue.\n\nEdit: since people are being ridiculously unhelpful on this thread, here\u2019s some advice to rectify the situation. \n\n1) Get back in your teachers\u2019 good graces. Moving classes isn\u2019t helpful to you or to Jane. Tell your counselor that you\u2019ve made a mistake and would like to be switched back. Ask if they have any resources for managing anxiety or depression. Be clear that this is a \u201cyou\u201d problem and you\u2019re sorry, but you are having nightmares and you\u2019d like to work on yourself so it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n2) Desensitize yourself to people with different kinds of disabilities. There\u2019s a really cool YouTube channel called Special Books by Special Kids with interviews from people with all kinds of physical and mental differences. I highly recommend it. \n\n3) I know people are saying to go and be nice to/befriend Jane, but as a former quiet weird kid, if someone in my class started being randomly nice to me after clearly being uncomfortable around me, I\u2019d take it as pity. Don\u2019t do anything disingenuous. If it\u2019s supposed to make you feel better, don\u2019t do it. \n\n4) Lucid dreaming. If you have the time, I\u2019d recommend meditating/lucid dreaming to help yourself confront your fear, or at least disentangle Jane from the underlying psychological issues you\u2019re having. Craft mental scenarios of you and her interacting and having a positive outcome. Visualize her face and associate it with things you like. Set up a trigger for yourself, such as a word or an item, so that if she starts to become monstrous, you can help yourself snap out of the dream. If you do this often enough during meditation, your subconscious can learn to conjure the item when the nightmare begins, which can alter the course of the dream or give you control over it. If it helps, get a good luck charm or a crystal to help you. Belief is a powerful thing and can be a handy tool for shutting your brain up. \n\nGood luck :)\n\n-signed a person who\u2019s almost done with nursing school", "Oh honey. YTA.

First, asking to switch to a seat behind her or in the back of the class would have been the first step. \n\nSecond, talk to your parents or another level headed adult you trust about your dreams and anxiety around this girl. NOT your friends. Not your classmates. A trusted adult who will listen till you\u2019re done talking then calmly work through the underlying issues. You can still do this step. \n\nThird, educate yourself. Challenge your perceptions of the world. Take a long look at yourself and why this disfigured girl makes you so uncomfortable.
