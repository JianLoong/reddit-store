Have you tried talking to this girl at all? If you got to know her a bit on a human level, this will make you see that she is a child just like you. I'm sure she's extremely self conscious about her scarring too. Also how can you be sure that now you have moved classes, the dreams will stop? If you are worried that you are being victimized by fully grown adults (teachers) you need to speak to your parents and your head teacher.", "Your teachers should not be targeting you, even if you were ableist. It's not right for a grown adult in a position of power to target a child. \n\nYour feelings that Jane isn't human can probably be solved by getting to know her as a person, or getting to know other people with facial issues. I suggest Special Books For Special Kids on YouTube, which is a channel that does interviews with people, adults and kids, with different deformities, disorders, and conditions. \n\nPeople with facial deformities are not scary or inhuman. Seeing that may help you not have nightmares about people who are just like you and I.\n\nYour teachers should not be targeting you for any reason, even if you may have come off as ableist. If you do take this to parents or headteacher, be sure to explain why you wanted the switch.", "YTA\n\nThe solution here isn't to stick a plaster over the issue by moving classes and hiding, but to figure out and solve the underlaying issue.\n\nIt sounds like you need professional help from an appropriate therapist or psychologist to help diagnose the issue and find the solution to help you out.", "Sorry but YTA (I know you are young, reason why the sorry) likewise your teachers are assholes for bullying you.\n\nWe all have things that could make us uncomfortable, we really can't control our feelings. But what we can control is how we act on them. If everyone followed their feelings even the not so great ones, especially when it revolves around not wanting to be close to someone else because of a physical attributes, what do you think will happen?\n\nYou should always try to find evidence for the feelings you have when irrational.

You staying away from her is confirming her being a monster which doesn't help, you want to be able to change that perspective", "OP I'd recommend you read a book called \"Wonder\". Your exact situation pretty much occurs in the book.", "YTA, have you ever thought how awful it is to live with permanent scarring?

Your teacher's reaction was disgusting and unprofessional but (despite your young age) you really are also YTA.", "YTA. You could have tried talking to Jane, to get to know her and see that she is human just like the rest of us. Maybe she is a very nice girl with some major insecurities, which you are now adding to because if teachers know about this, then other people at school likely do to. If it turned out that Jane was not a nice person after you started talking to her, then you would have a legit reason to give your counselor for switching classes. Either way, you would see that she is a person and not a monster.", "Your teachers absolutely suck and are disgusting people. You are a child, you do not deserve adults bullying you. However, you are getting old enough to realize what you did was wrong. You let ableism win. You refused to talk to her so your mind refuses to see her as a human.", "YTA. Nothing Jane can do about her appearance, but there\u2019s a lot you can do to change your attitude. Jane is no different than you. \n\nI\u2019m also a teacher, and would have talked to you about your shallow excuse for swapping classes too. I wouldn\u2019t have swapped you to another class. Get to know Jane and accept her for who she is. Grow up.", "YTA. Do you think Jane wouldn't know why you moved classes or how you act around her?\nI'm trying to be gentle because you're very young but how you act now will play a huge part in Jane's life.\nShe's likely already going through so much and hyperaware of how other people perceive her. Doing something as hurtful as this would stick with her for life.\nTry sitting and talking to her. I think that would help with your nightmares and also help her.

As someone who has extremely prominent body markings from a birth defect, I can assure you that Jane is hyperaware of why you are switching class. People with scarring or birth defects aren\u2019t monsters and your behavior is incredibly concerning.\n\nAlso, the fact your consular and teachers reacted like this makes me suspicious that you are actually bullying her and they didn\u2019t know who it was until you approached them.", "Very soft YTA. I can understand why you think your reaction is appropriate if you're being truthful about the nightmares etc and being impacted so deeply.. however, you need to humanise people with facial disfigurements, not run away from them. \nDo you have any good and wise friend to confide in? Sibling? Parent? Could you maybe go back to that school counsellor? You really need to keep talking about this. The way your teachers have responded irritates me no end, because they should be educating you, not punishing you.", "Soft YTA. I do wonder if the teachers are picking on you or does it just feel like that? If they are insulting you start a diary of what they say and when they say it. \n\nI think the other thing to have done is speak to a parent or guardian and ask about counselling as there is possibly something else going on that is manifesting itself in this fear of a classmate", "YTA. Poor 'Jane'.", "NTA. You didn't bully Jane or treat her badly, and if you had talked about your issue with a therapist that would be totally normal. You talked to a school counselor and not only did they fail to counsel you they also didn't respect any form of confidentiality or privacy and shared what you told them with other teachers. And the teachers bullying you is not ok either.\nI suggest you talk to your parents about all of this if you haven't already.", "You already know the answer to your question when you said you were a bad person. \n\nIt is horrible and ableist to request to be separated from someone with a disability. You\u2019re blaming this person, who was the victim in an accident, for your grades dropping. Your grades are something you have control over. \n\nIt\u2019s time for you to seek out therapy. Like actual, real therapy to deal with your issues\u2026and it just checking in with a guidance counselor.\n\nYou\u2019re going to meet a lot of people in life- you\u2019re going to have to learn how to work with everyone, regardless of their physical presentation and abilities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to reassure yourself this is not happening to you, it\u2019s not a threat to you and not going to kill you. Repeat this to yourself on the way to school and before bed if you need to.

Your school counsellor is not cut out for that kind of work. \n\nI hope that doesn\u2019t prevent you from seeking therapy if you ever need it in the future - any self respecting mental health professional will be able to hear anything you\u2019ve got to say without judgement and would NEVER yell or lose their cool with you. \n\n\nMy advice is try not to be too hard on yourself.

For you it is possible and given your lack of access to a professional therapist and the incompetence of your school counsellor, it is the best thing for both you and the other child. You don\u2019t have to suffer all day every day and she doesn\u2019t have to share space with someone who finds her scary enough to induce nightmares and anxiety.

They are encouraging you to feel even worse about yourself and none of them actually care about YOUR well-being or your mental health. They only care about appearing politically correct.

When the only solution you can come up with is to do literally nothing at all and just run away from the problem, try talking to someone else about it to get some perspective. \nIf you want to grow into being a strong and capable person, it happens by challenging yourself and deliberately choosing to face your fears rather than turning back every time you run into something new or scary. \n\nThe counselor and teachers should have explained this to you and offered you the opportunity to made a better choice and supported you by giving you strategies to work through your fears. \n\nIt's not too late though to take some of the suggestions you see here and improve yourself.

You will feel anxious if you see her elsewhere and the memory of her face is unlikely to still feel triggering. \n\nIf you learned to relax in her presence or deal with your anxiety without avoiding it, eventually her face wouldn\u2019t make you as anxious and you\u2019d be past this difficulty. \n\nEscaping acute anxiety doesn\u2019t make it go away in the long run.
