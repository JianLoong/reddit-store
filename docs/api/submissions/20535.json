Have you tried talking to this girl at all? If you got to know her a bit on a human level, this will make you see that she is a child just like you. I'm sure she's extremely self conscious about her scarring too. Also how can you be sure that now you have moved classes, the dreams will stop? If you are worried that you are being victimized by fully grown adults (teachers) you need to speak to your parents and your head teacher.", "Your teachers should not be targeting you, even if you were ableist. It's not right for a grown adult in a position of power to target a child. \n\nYour feelings that Jane isn't human can probably be solved by getting to know her as a person, or getting to know other people with facial issues. I suggest Special Books For Special Kids on YouTube, which is a channel that does interviews with people, adults and kids, with different deformities, disorders, and conditions. \n\nPeople with facial deformities are not scary or inhuman. Seeing that may help you not have nightmares about people who are just like you and I.\n\nYour teachers should not be targeting you for any reason, even if you may have come off as ableist. If you do take this to parents or headteacher, be sure to explain why you wanted the switch.", "YTA\n\nThe solution here isn't to stick a plaster over the issue by moving classes and hiding, but to figure out and solve the underlaying issue.\n\nIt sounds like you need professional help from an appropriate therapist or psychologist to help diagnose the issue and find the solution to help you out.", "Sorry but YTA (I know you are young, reason why the sorry) likewise your teachers are assholes for bullying you.\n\nWe all have things that could make us uncomfortable, we really can't control our feelings. But what we can control is how we act on them. If everyone followed their feelings even the not so great ones, especially when it revolves around not wanting to be close to someone else because of a physical attributes, what do you think will happen?\n\nYou should always try to find evidence for the feelings you have when irrational.

Your teacher's reaction was disgusting and unprofessional but (despite your young age) you really are also YTA.", "YTA. You could have tried talking to Jane, to get to know her and see that she is human just like the rest of us. Maybe she is a very nice girl with some major insecurities, which you are now adding to because if teachers know about this, then other people at school likely do to. If it turned out that Jane was not a nice person after you started talking to her, then you would have a legit reason to give your counselor for switching classes. Either way, you would see that she is a person and not a monster.", "Your teachers absolutely suck and are disgusting people. You are a child, you do not deserve adults bullying you.

Nothing Jane can do about her appearance, but there\u2019s a lot you can do to change your attitude. Jane is no different than you. \n\nI\u2019m also a teacher, and would have talked to you about your shallow excuse for swapping classes too. I wouldn\u2019t have swapped you to another class. Get to know Jane and accept her for who she is. Grow up.", "YTA. Do you think Jane wouldn't know why you moved classes or how you act around her?\nI'm trying to be gentle because you're very young but how you act now will play a huge part in Jane's life.\nShe's likely already going through so much and hyperaware of how other people perceive her. Doing something as hurtful as this would stick with her for life.\nTry sitting and talking to her. I think that would help with your nightmares and also help her.

As someone who has extremely prominent body markings from a birth defect, I can assure you that Jane is hyperaware of why you are switching class. People with scarring or birth defects aren\u2019t monsters and your behavior is incredibly concerning.\n\nAlso, the fact your consular and teachers reacted like this makes me suspicious that you are actually bullying her and they didn\u2019t know who it was until you approached them.", "Very soft YTA. I can understand why you think your reaction is appropriate if you're being truthful about the nightmares etc and being impacted so deeply.. however, you need to humanise people with facial disfigurements, not run away from them. \nDo you have any good and wise friend to confide in? Sibling? Parent? Could you maybe go back to that school counsellor? You really need to keep talking about this. The way your teachers have responded irritates me no end, because they should be educating you, not punishing you.", "Soft YTA. I do wonder if the teachers are picking on you or does it just feel like that? If they are insulting you start a diary of what they say and when they say it. \n\nI think the other thing to have done is speak to a parent or guardian and ask about counselling as there is possibly something else going on that is manifesting itself in this fear of a classmate", "YTA. Poor 'Jane'.", "NTA. You didn't bully Jane or treat her badly, and if you had talked about your issue with a therapist that would be totally normal. You talked to a school counselor and not only did they fail to counsel you they also didn't respect any form of confidentiality or privacy and shared what you told them with other teachers. And the teachers bullying you is not ok either.\nI suggest you talk to your parents about all of this if you haven't already.", "You already know the answer to your question when you said you were a bad person. \n\nIt is horrible and ableist to request to be separated from someone with a disability. You\u2019re blaming this person, who was the victim in an accident, for your grades dropping. Your grades are something you have control over. \n\nIt\u2019s time for you to seek out therapy.

Out-grouping people with disabilitys is obviously gross and needs to be called out as soon as it shows up, but this doesn't sound like that's what's happening. Out-grouping usually means calling public attention to the difference that the person has, and rallying support against them. It's a very public, loud spectical with the purpose of defining social boundaries. None of that you did, in fact you went to quite some lengths to not draw attention to the difference or the cause of your discomfort in case it hurt her, and you solution to the problem was to remove yourself quietly as appose to her. \n\nI also think both the people here and your teachers think that you are the-big-bad-scary that just doesn't like disabled people, and are ironically rallying to out group you. If you did think that way they would be justified in being angry, but all we have to go off is what you've told us, and from what you've said, its not the situation. The fact that someone so young can be that badly hurt is a legitimately distressing thing, especially if it was done at the hands of someone rather than an accident. It's the kind of proof you can't ignore or deny that life is scary and that sometimes we have very little control over our own safety. If you all ready have trama around d.v. or just violence in general I could see that as being genuinely triggering, and in a way that you can't just logic your way out. Because anxiety isn't logical. \n\nSo, I request more info; if you are not against disabled people and are genuinely shook up by something about the disfigurements, what is it? What's going on? Do you have people you can go to for help?", "You need to get into counseling to get over this irrational fear. And not school counselor counseling. You need a professional therapist.  \n  \n  You are not a bad person.", "OP I am so sorry that the counselor and teachers are treating you this way. I see that you don\u2019t want to hurt Jane, but also need to take care of yourself.  Is there a way for you to access some therapy to work through this hard time?

You are not a bad person. You are a 14 year old who is clearly having some mental health issues. It is not normal to have nightmares because of Jane's facial deformities. You know that Jane is a normal person who had an accident, and you obviously are not intending to bully her. Unfortunately there are some people out there who will bully people who are different and your school councilor, and also many of the respondents here are focusing on protecting Jane. With that mindset they are not listening to you and only hearing that you want to move classes because Jane is ugly.\n\nI'm not a mental health professional, but from my personal experience, it sounds like you could be experiencing the beginning of an anxiety disorder. You might want to googleobsessive compulsive disorder, which can include obsessive intrusive and unwanted thoughts. You might find more support online in a subreddit specifically for mental health related topics.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that your school councilor has not provided you with more support. I can tell you must be going through a very difficult time. As far as practical suggestions, if being in the same class as Jane is causing you anxiety and nightmares it is okay for you to want to move classes. However, as you have already seen, many people will not be understanding of your anxiety of facial deformities. If you haven't already found a way to move classes, consider making up an excuse, some possible suggestions might be to say that the class is too hard, or that there is another class you would find more interesting?", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou are just a kid but you know the accident probably wasn't her fault and she doesn't deserve to be seen as you see her.
