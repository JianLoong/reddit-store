Jane unfortunately had a really bad accident sometime before I met her, which left her face with a lot of scarring.

I don\u2019t really have much interaction with Jane, because until now we\u2019ve never been in the same class. However we\u2019re now in the same class and sit close to each other. Jane is a pretty quiet girl, and I do my best to treat her like anyone else. \n\nHowever, a few weeks ago I began having nightmares about her face. It\u2019s always a bit different but the general gist is that she is chasing me, growling and hissing. I understand it\u2019s not her fault, and that it\u2019s my problem, but I also began having anxiety while in class too, as she sits directly behind me. \n\nIt\u2019s affecting my academic performance, as I cannot focus in class and I\u2019m waking up from my sleep 2-3 times a night. I\u2019ve been keeping this all to myself, but my grades have begun to slip, which led me to go to my school counsellor. \n\nI asked her to swap classes with another teacher. However the counsellor told me she needed a reason, to measure teacher performance or if a student is bullying me. I told her I just wanted to swap classes, as I didn\u2019t wanna lie and get someone else in trouble. She refused to swap me until I told her the reason. \n\nI eventually caved and told her I couldn\u2019t be in the same class as Jane and she looked like she wanted to expel me from life. She called me a horrible person and yelled at me a lot before saying she\u2019ll swap me. \n\nShe did and now all the teachers are going after me.

Have you tried talking to this girl at all? If you got to know her a bit on a human level, this will make you see that she is a child just like you. I'm sure she's extremely self conscious about her scarring too. Also how can you be sure that now you have moved classes, the dreams will stop? If you are worried that you are being victimized by fully grown adults (teachers) you need to speak to your parents and your head teacher.", "Your teachers should not be targeting you, even if you were ableist. It's not right for a grown adult in a position of power to target a child. \n\nYour feelings that Jane isn't human can probably be solved by getting to know her as a person, or getting to know other people with facial issues. I suggest Special Books For Special Kids on YouTube, which is a channel that does interviews with people, adults and kids, with different deformities, disorders, and conditions. \n\nPeople with facial deformities are not scary or inhuman. Seeing that may help you not have nightmares about people who are just like you and I.\n\nYour teachers should not be targeting you for any reason, even if you may have come off as ableist. If you do take this to parents or headteacher, be sure to explain why you wanted the switch.", "YTA\n\nThe solution here isn't to stick a plaster over the issue by moving classes and hiding, but to figure out and solve the underlaying issue.\n\nIt sounds like you need professional help from an appropriate therapist or psychologist to help diagnose the issue and find the solution to help you out.", "Sorry but YTA (I know you are young, reason why the sorry) likewise your teachers are assholes for bullying you.\n\nWe all have things that could make us uncomfortable, we really can't control our feelings. But what we can control is how we act on them. If everyone followed their feelings even the not so great ones, especially when it revolves around not wanting to be close to someone else because of a physical attributes, what do you think will happen?\n\nYou should always try to find evidence for the feelings you have when irrational. Jane is not a monster. You staying away from her is confirming her being a monster which doesn't help, you want to be able to change that perspective", "OP I'd recommend you read a book called \"Wonder\". You're exact situation pretty much occurs in the book.", "YTA, have you ever thought how awful it is to live with permanent scarring? You should have thought of how to deal with the reaction you have instead of just turning your back. Your teacher's reaction was disgusting and unprofessional but (despite your young age) you really are also YTA.", "YTA. You could have tried talking to Jane, to get to know her and see that she is human just like the rest of us. Maybe she is a very nice girl with some major insecurities, which you are now adding to because if teachers know about this, then other people at school likely do to. If it turned out that Jane was not a nice person after you started talking to her, then you would have a legit reason to give your counselor for switching classes. Either way, you would see that she is a person and not a monster.", "Your teachers absolutely suck and are disgusting people. You are a child, you do not deserve adults bullying you. However, you are getting old enough to realize what you did was wrong. You let ableism win. You refused to talk to her so your mind refuses to see her as a human.", "YTA. Nothing Jane can do about her appearance, but there\u2019s a lot you can do to change your attitude. Jane is no different than you. \n\nI\u2019m also a teacher, and would have talked to you about your shallow excuse for swapping classes too. I wouldn\u2019t have swapped you to another class. Get to know Jane and accept her for who she is. Grow up.", "YTA. Do you think Jane wouldn't know why you moved classes or how you act around her?\nI'm trying to be gentle because you're very young but how you act now will play a huge part in Jane's life.\nShe's likely already going through so much and hyperaware of how other people perceive her. Doing something as hurtful as this would stick with her for life.\nTry sitting and talking to her. I think that would help with your nightmares and also help her. Be kind.", "I think wanted to change class because someone has a disability or a face you don\u2019t like is quite bad BUT the teachers are the ASSHOLES. \n\nYou respectfully asked to change but now they\u2019re kind of bullying you", "YTA. As someone who has extremely prominent body markings from a birth defect, I can assure you that Jane is hyperaware of why you are switching class. People with scarring or birth defects aren\u2019t monsters and your behavior is incredibly concerning.\n\nAlso, the fact your consular and teachers reacted like this makes me suspicious that you are actually bullying her and they didn\u2019t know who it was until you approached them.", "Very soft YTA. I can understand why you think your reaction is appropriate if you're being truthful about the nightmares etc and being impacted so deeply.. however, you need to humanise people with facial disfigurements, not run away from them. \nDo you have any good and wise friend to confide in? Sibling? Parent? Could you maybe go back to that school counsellor? You really need to keep talking about this. The way your teachers have responded irritates me no end, because they should be educating you, not punishing you.", "Soft YTA. I do wonder if the teachers are picking on you or does it just feel like that? If they are insulting you start a diary of what they say and when they say it. \n\nI think the other thing to have done is speak to a parent or guardian and ask about counselling as there is possibly something else going on that is manifesting itself in this fear of a classmate", "YTA. Poor 'Jane'.", "NTA. You didn't bully Jane or treat her badly, and if you had talked about your issue with a therapist that would be totally normal. You talked to a school counselor and not only did they fail to counsel you they also didn't respect any form of confidentiality or privacy and shared what you told them with other teachers. And the teachers bullying you is not ok either.\nI suggest you talk to your parents about all of this if you haven't already.", "You already know the answer to your question when you said you were a bad person. \n\nIt is horrible and ableist to request to be separated from someone with a disability. You\u2019re blaming this person, who was the victim in an accident, for your grades dropping. Your grades are something you have control over. \n\nIt\u2019s time for you to seek out therapy. Like actual, real therapy to deal with your issues\u2026and it just checking in with a guidance counselor.\n\nYou\u2019re going to meet a lot of people in life- you\u2019re going to have to learn how to work with everyone, regardless of their physical presentation and abilities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ffs, you have nightmares, isn't it like your councellor job definition to councel a therapy? (I am not sure how this works in your country) You didn't bully the girl, you tried to solve it on your own then went for help to an adult.

You're counsellor sucks and rest of the teachers for bullying you. You are not a bad person. The situation just sucks.", "NTA\nYou are subconsciously scared and you know your feelings are wrong and unvalid. I would say you should have trusted someone with this and tried to work on it but when you opened up to the school counsellor! they insulted you?! \nHeck no all adults in this story are massive AHs!\n\nPlease talk to your parents. Explain your feelings and that you've tried to find a solution on your own. \nSay you want to work on resolving this. You have not treated Jane badly, you just made the simple mistake of not working through your feelings because you didn't know how.\n\nEvery teacher involved in bullying you (yes, that's what they are doing) and the counsellor should be punished for this. It probably won't happen but your parents could help you switch school if needed or at the very least set things right.", "NTA but the counselor are TA.\n\nHowever you need to get help dealing with your obsessive thoughts. At your age, the hormones are kicking off which can impair your ability to process.  Good luck.", "NTA \nIt sucks that Jane had scars but if you are having real issues from being around her then you need to get away.

Poor kid has enough to deal with without your ridiculous behaviour", "If you run away from her in real life, you'll keep running from her in your dreams. If you make friends with her in real life, even if it's just to get to know her personality, share some in-class jokes, then say goodbye and not be actual friends in life, in your dreams, you'll see her, make a joke, then move along with your dream.", "I have read that, I would never make fun of Jane, or in any way expect anyone to socially exclude her, my issues are my issues, not hers.", "I disagree.
