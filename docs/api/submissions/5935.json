I should mention I have a one bedroom. I invited my two female friends (Amanda and Christy) and their SO\u2019s (Josh and Kyle), as well as my boyfriend (totaling 6 including me.) I wanted to make Christmas cookies, a charcuterie board, and do a small gift exchange. \n\nA few days before my party, my friend Amanda told her two friends about my party and they said they wanted to come. I told her okay, that\u2019s fine. (Even though I didn\u2019t know them too well and was a little weary about 8 people in a small space and had to buy more food.) The night before the party, Amanda\u2019s husband, Josh, announces to his three guy friends that I am having a party and now they want to join. \nI am not close with these three guy friends, and a small couples event has turned into an 11 people party which I just don\u2019t have the space for. One of the guys who is coming has been particularly disrespectful to Josh\u2019s wife Amanda in the past and I didn\u2019t like that. I told them no, I don\u2019t have the space or extra money to accommodate 3 more people. \n\nJosh kept pushing it, and I told him no. He asks why can\u2019t we just have a party at his house (his house is particularly dirty and usually they go into his computer room and play video games all night.) He announces he\u2019s not coming, that his friends basically hate me now, and it\u2019s \u201cmessed up of me to do this.\u201d \nI have been apologizing and even tried to change my plan so we could all just go out to a bar so everyone could go and be included. Josh told me \u201cgood, because you\u2019ll have to apologize to my friends when we\u2019re out since theyll be there.\u201d He ruined the night, he refused to talk to me. \nHe sat in a corner and played Pok\u00e9mon go all night. \n\nSince this happened, my friendship of five years with Amanda has been ruined.

Josh should accept that his friends can\u2019t come because you have a small place, that is child-like behaviour. And if he keeps having a go at you, you can really bug him by saying \u201cOh well\u201d at the end if you like petty revenge", "You have bullied... NTA.\nDon't apologize to this bunch of entitled AH. Hope Amanda will stop dating a kid with no manners.", "NTA. Josh is a little beeyotch for trying to bully you into inviting more people to the party and trying to make you change your plans. Actually, Josh should have stayed his ass at home or gone elsewhere. Eight is enough.", "NTA. it\u2019s not their party being hosted. it\u2019s very rude to just invite someone over when been invited\nto another\u2019s house.

Why is he still hanging our with people who disrespect his wife. Call him out on his bullying. \n'Josh, When you speak to me like that it feels like an order, and I feel like i am being manipulated into doing what you want'", "NTA\n\nJosh is a clear AH. Amanda is less of one, but is still an AH both for requesting extra attendees who you don\u2019t know well and for not intervening with Josh.\n\nYou should not have apologised.

Did you find them at the zoo?\n\nYou organised a small pre-christmas get-together and invited a select number of people and their significant others. I've lived in small apartments before - it's impossible to cater for more than a few people and even then, chances are it'll be cramped. But that's okay, you're all friends.\n\nInstead of being all 'hey great can we bring anything?', they ask to bring more people. You simply don't invite other people to someone else's home but if you must, you ask politely and accept whatever answer you're given. There's nothing stopping them from having a party at their own homes on a different day and inviting all the people they want. \n\nJosh is just rubbish, though. I'd hesitate to call him a friend big time. There was zero respect towards you. \n\nNTA", "NTA- No one should be inviting randos to your house. It sounds like you might need some new friends. How old are you guys? Josh sounds like a 12 year-old. Amanda just seems rude for starting this by inviting other randos.", "NTA. Josh needs to get a grip and sounds like an awful partner. I hope your friend Amanda is ok. \n\nIf he acts so vile towards her friends and let\u2019s his friends treat her like shit publicly, god knows what he does behind closed doors. \n\nTbh I wouldn\u2019t let Josh into my home or be at any events with him from now on.", "NTA.

Your \"friends\" have revealed themselves too.", "NTA he doesn't get to invite people to a place that isn't his. You had a small place and didn't want a big party there. Josh sounds like a child. Time to move on and find some real adult friends.", " NTA.", "NTA. Josh is behaving like a self-centred 13-year-old.", "NTA. You set down a boundary and he insisted on stomping on it. You didn\u2019t owe him an apology nor his friends. You wanted to host a small affair at your place and that was perfectly fine. If he wanted to host at his place then you should\u2019ve told him to either handle NYE or that you\u2019ll switch and leave him to figure out how handle entertainment and food. \n\nIf anyone owes an apology it\u2019s the people who invited more people. The beauty of Facebook invitations is the limit to RSVPs. And it\u2019s rude to extend an invitation to other people ESPECIALLY when it\u2019s more then a plus 1. \n\nIgnore Josh cuz he ain\u2019t worth your time, effort or energy. He threw a tantrum and pouted the whole night. Don\u2019t avoid Amanda, still hang out with her, chat and do whatever y\u2019all have always done. Let her see that Josh is the problem and not you.

Absolutely NTA.", "NTA, both Amand and Josh are entitled. How can you invite people to someone else's party?! Don't apologise, it is your space and your money, you choose who you welcome in it. And no one can pressure you to do otherwise.", "NTA. No one should be inviting others to someone else's party, particularly a small, intimate gathering of close friends like this. OP, it's okay to say no. But Josh sounds like a child. Do not apologize. Let him tantrum. Don't feed into it. You have no obligation to cater to his whims.", "You invited a small handful of people that you trust and two of those people took that as an invitation to try and walk all over you.\n\nOne of them then goes out of his way to make you out to be the villain for being unable to accommodate an unreasonable demand.\n\nNTA, and if anyone expects you to apologise for something that's not your fault, don't.", "NTA.\nI cannot imagine inviting people to someone else\u2019s party without having been told it\u2019s ok to do so.\n\nAnd then to act like act like a giant baby when you\u2019re told \u201cno.\u201d Josh sounds like a big jerk and Amanda should know better than to invite people \u201cbecause they want to go.\u201d My 10 year old niece has better manners than these \u201cadults.\u201d", "NTA. Amanda needs to speak with him about his attitude because no one is entitled to invite people to your place without permission.

I\u2019d say Josh is no loss.", "NTA. But don't make a FB invite for an intimate event. Talk to people or send a group text and be clear as to the small guest list", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. \n\nI wish we saw more people like Josh asking if he's TA because he invited people to someone else's home and didn't want to back down when told no. I can't stand how so many entitled people sit there and act like they are 100% right, even though it should be apparent to ANY adult that he's in the wrong. \n\nNo one should be mad at you op. They should be mad at Josh's audacity. You did nothing wrong.", "Lol HUGE NTA. What the fuck is Josh\u2019s problem???  If he wants to throw a party his way, he can throw a party. You can\u2019t hijack someone\u2019s small gathering and invite a bunch of strangers and then get mad when the person isn\u2019t cool with it.

I know this is assuming a lot, but does Josh try to alienate Amanda from her friends? I\u2019m trying to understand why he would allow his disrespectful friends around Amanda, but seems to be purposely messing with your friendship. Neither of them should have invited more people (that\u2019s super rude), but then he pushed it and tried to make you the bad guy (you\u2019re absolutely not) when you politely declined (I would have too).\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Boundaries are absolutely ok to set. It was your party and you never should have been put in the position to have to decline extra guests, and definitely shouldn\u2019t have been manipulated into apologizing for it.
