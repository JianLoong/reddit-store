She did everything she could to make me let her live with her dad. She was rude and misbehaved until when she was 14 I told her I can't do this anymore. I asked her why she is acting like this and she said she wants me to let her live with her dad so I told her she can live with her dad but if she changes her mind she can come back. She left and didn't even come to see me for 2 years. \n\nShe called me a few weeks ago and said she wants to stay with me one or two weekends a month from now on. I told her I'm glad and I'm looking forward it.\n\nLast weekend she came home I told her she can sleep on the couch. She asked me why she can't stay in her bedroom. I told her that my boyfriend who I live with has 2 daughters and that bedroom is theirs now. The room is too small for 3 people so she has to sleep on the couch.\n\nShe called me an asshole and and said there is no way she'll sleep on the couch. She called her dad who picked her up in an hour and left.\n\nShe sent me a text and said since I don't have a place for her in my home, she won't come back\n\nI think she is acting very entitled because she left and didn't come back for 2 years.

However, reading your post and comments, I have a sneaky feeling that you - subconsciously or not - might not have communicated the couch situation to your daughter in advance and instead ambushed her with it as a way to punish her for staying away from you for 2 years. She hurt you by keeping you at a distance for so long, and you want to show her that she\u2019s been downgraded to \u201cguest\u201d level as a consequence.

I think it's unreasonable for her to expected a room to have been kept for her after all this time, but you should have had this conversation long before she came over to stay. I mean, it's not very nice to have it sprung on you that you have no room once you are already there. I'm going YTA because you didn't have this conversation with her before she came over.

She has the option of bunking with the them (try it for obe night to see if it's workable) or taking the couch but you're not kicking your stepdaughters out of their room. If the sleeping arrangements are not to her liking, she can do day visits instead. Dad drops her off in the morning and picks up in the evening. There are two other parts to this conversation.

You\u2019re essentially telling her that your bf and his daughters take precedent over her and that they\u2019re your \u2018actual\u2019 family now.\n\nThe fact you can\u2019t see the wrong in what you did and the fact you\u2019re blaming a 14 yr old child about her upset response is extremely telling about your personality and character. How are you the victim in this, even slightly? I\u2019m guessing you feel like everyone else is always the problem, huh?\n\nNarc parents do stuff like this and can\u2019t understand why their kids don\u2019t want contact with them or put them in nursing homes. You\u2019ve sent this vulnerable child a very loud and clear message that she isn\u2019t important in your life and that she\u2019s unwanted. Don\u2019t be surprised if she turns into a massively troubled adult who will look for validation and love in all the wrong people. \n\nBut yeah, glad your bf and his daughters are enjoying her space! \n\nYTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not the child\u2019s job to", "The disgusting responses attacking OP is quite unbelievable. But then again, what do you expect from a bunch of wannabe therapists.", "My guy sometimes the mom isn't at fault here", "I agree. The commenters in these comments are beyond AH behavior.", "Where does it say he was abusive? \n\nThe only indication of anything here is a flip comment about him being the \"fun parent\" from an obviously unreliable narrator.\n\nOP is TA.", "No my ex was so horrible my therapist suggested not having any kind of contact with him", "This is an utterly disgusting comment!", "You do not know this person or the full story. You have no idea what their relationship with the father may be like. What an awful thing to say hiding behind a computer screen.", "When I moved out, my room was taken over by my younger sister. When I came home I slept on the couch. I know it's shocking to the privileged that my room was used for a person who actually lived there. People here need to get a grip.", "I guess OP could have sold her two bedroom house and bought a bigger one just in case her daughter decided to come back. Money being so easy and all.", "Jesus Christ why do you people always act like it's so easy to just up and buy a bigger house? Getting a place is NOT easy not to mention it's super expensive and not everyone can just afford to up and get a bigger place.", "But the daughter showed the Mom that she had no place for her.", "14 is old enough for a child to decide what parent they want to live with. Not sure what difference it would have made for OP to go to court. \n\nAlso, OP and he\u2019s bf have been dating for 4 years. Are they not allowed to live together just in case her daughter, who hadn\u2019t spoken to her in 2 years, decided she wanted to go to her mom\u2019s once a month for a night or two?", "Yeah because everyone can just afford to buy a new house. Lmao be for real", "If that is cruel and unnecessary God help mankind. But then again, this is some 1st world level bs.", "But I see you point, the next time I want to torture someone, I'll just not tell them where they are gonna sleep, might be better than waterboarding.", "Yes I'm the abusive one and he didn't get any custody because of his wonderful personality", "I\u2019m curious as to why after two years she wanted to come back. Did something at dad\u2019s house change recently? Did he get a girlfriend with children? Was no longer his main focus?", "Bingo. This is the YTA moment. Sure you already decided that she wasn't really your daughter years ago, but this was when you really drove in the knife the cement the relationship.", "Ok. So you do realize yta. Cool.", "Oh so you admit you tricked her? YTA be a better mom", "Remember this is entirely biased toward OP's perspective. You don't think it's odd the daughter never even wanted to visit for 2 years? This goes way beyond simple daddy's girl favouritism", "In threads like these you notice how toxic this place really is.", "I\u2019m glad to see I\u2019m not the only one who thinks OP is NTA. Considering the ex husband was abusive, it would not surprise me at all if he was telling the daughter lies about her mom and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t talk to her mom for 2 years.", "She came here for judgment. She\u2019s getting judged.", "It's what you came here for, to try to sound like the smartest one. You're peeing in the pool while you shame others for sitting in piss.", "It\u2019s because she\u2019s a parent treating her child like she\u2019s an adult. 98% of the time, the parent is the asshole because whatever the kid does, they\u2019re a child. And they\u2019re YOUR child.", "In one of the comments OP said her therapist advised her to cut all contact with him.", "Your therapist told you to abandon your daughter?", "Even if it meant never seeing your child? Either you have a terrible therapist or they did not say that.", "Do you have a restraining order or order of protection against him?", "He is probably a narcissist and enabler from your daughters behavior and she has probably become like him in the years she has been with him.", "What in the heck is wrong with sleeping on a couch? If you don't have extra bedrooms where should one put a person up? I suppose a inflatable mattress is a no go as well.\n\nI've even slept on the couch in my own home, what's the big deal?", "Yeah, duh. You don't have a money tree in your backyard? Just go pick a couple bills and you're good.", "Then she shouldn't have let her boyfriend and two kids move in with her!.\n\nShe should have said that the spare bedroom is for her daughter to come and stay and there is no room for them to move in until they go and find somewhere bigger.\n\nPeople do move you know and people do upsize when they go from living on their own to living with a partner and kids!!.", "She was fourteen - sixteen. She\u2019s a dumb teen, and was making an attempt to reconcile. \n\nThis is what OP did?", "I love comments like this. The mom has no accountability and yet the 16 year old daughter should know better because \"reasons\". Maybe you should stop projecting and seek help.", "Going to court would have gotten her visitation rights and access to her daughter if she cared. Then maybe her boyfriend wouldn't have moved in since her daughter would have been a regular feature of her life. Why doesn't this guy have a home for his children?", "It\u2019s one of the basic aspects of custody. Where a parent can\u2019t, or won\u2019t provide a room (shared if necessary) for them, that speaks against overnight custody. If she can\u2019t, she can\u2019t. But then she can\u2019t manage custody. This is where OP\u2019s priorities come into play. Prioritise step family who\u2019s there all the time, or your own child for when they come. It\u2019s her choice what she does, but why the hell would any self respecting child agree to stay in those circumstances?", "And that is your biased opinion. We know absolutely nothing about the father's role in any of this, and considering the fact that OPs therapist had to advise her to stay away from the ex, I'm inclined to believe there is something more to this that is not 100 percent OP total fault. I don't agree with you.", "Then explain why the sad never encouraged her to visit the mom in 2YEARS?", "Oh I know, and they get you banned for not agreeing with their toxic point of view.", "Eh\u2026why wouldn\u2019t she have included that in the OP? I don\u2019t know. Just very suspect. Either way, she could\u2019ve explained the reality of her sleeping arrangements before she arrived.", "Or maybe she didnt talked with op because op didnt give a fuck about her.", "And that is fine. That doesn't mean that judgement is right.", "No, I just find the attack on OP disgusting. You just believe that cause I'm not falling in line.", "How is she treating her child like an Adult? By letting her go live with her Dad, because that was what she wanted? She was out of OPs life for two years and what? Expected to show back up and get her old room back? She was a guest in OP's home and OP offered her the Couch. She is within her right to refuse, which she did. I don't see the problem here at all.", "oh, I didn't see her replies. I think it's still pretty obvious that OP is a completely unreliable narrator, and the fact that she has basically zero relationship with her daughter is her responsibility.", "Nope, we\u2019re not doing that.\n\n40% of cops self report that they engage in intimate partner abuse. \n\nThese are the people victims have to go through to get orders of protection. \n\nJudges will give visitation to rapists. \n\nNope. The patriarchal legal system is not a fair judge of abuse.", "No", "Yea I'm not sure what she's supposed to do. If it's a 2 bedroom house it's two bedrooms. Most people can't just pack up and move, especially based off a maybe, one day, possibly, the daughter might want to come stay.", "Right? All these comments talking about sleeping on the couch like it's some form of abuse are driving me mad", "if you can\u2019t afford rooms for everyone you probably can\u2019t afford the family either\n\nedited for clarification: i\u2019m not saying kids that don\u2019t get their own master bedrooms are deprived.  i\u2019m saying a lot of people have kids they can\u2019t afford / don\u2019t have the room for but still consciously choose to have kids anyways", "This is 100% just my opinion so others may disagree with me, but the way I see it. It isn't a couch issue. It's a displacement issue and the fact that mom lied to the daughter and daughter.comes home and finds out that the new family has taken over. I can see it being the daughter feeling she has been replaced now.", "\"she's a dumb teen\". You're making excuses.", "What exactly should the mom be accountable for? I have yet to hear a valid argument. The 16 year old should know better because she clearly made the choice that she did not want to live there.", "This. There\u2019s something about OPs relationship with her BF that maybe bothered Nova. Maybe realizing the BF and his kids would eventually be moving in and she wouldn\u2019t be a priority? Sure, she favored her Dad, but even more so knowing his focus would be on her only.", "Not sure where you\u2019re getting your info that having a bedroom is necessary for an overnight visit. I\u2019ll concede that OP should have invested in a pull out sofa so daughter had a real bed, but based on my research, for one overnight visit a month, a bedroom is not required.", "Why would she care about you when you don\u2019t care about her? You can\u2019t even respect her enough to let her know ahead of time that her room is now occupied.", "If she's never met them, which it sounds like she hasn't, they aren't family to her. They are your boyfriends kids who have taken her room and place in the house while she, your child is resigned to the couch. \n\nIf you cared enough about her, you'd have got a camp bed, trundle bed in her old room on the off chance she did want to stay over OR TOLD HER there was no place for her to stay but you'd be happy to do a girls day/dinner with JUST HER. But you did nothing and wonder why she left?", "You\u2019re not mature enough to have children.", "It\u2019s your family, not here. And you are imposing it on her. She probably feels that you were quick to replace her with boyfriend and daughters and expect her to take the couch like she\u2019s no longer your family.", "It's pretty clear why she preferred her father.  YTA...I guarantee this is the last time you see your daughter for a looooong time.  I'm not saying you had to leave a room empty for two years, but you're treating her comfort like an afterthought, clearly put thought into how to manipulate her into coming when you know she wouldn't want to if she had all the information, and spent two years sulking like a toddler in the corner when your relationship with your child went through some normal teenager BS.", "But you didn't care enough about family to make sure your child had a room at your house or to go spend time with her for years. Why would she?", "No. You're the adult. Don't ask childern to be the adult in a situation. Plus where was your care enough about family to spend time with your daughter over the past few years?", "to care about family is a 2 way street. also she js a child. christ YTA", "So how you\u2019re just straight up lying. One comment ago you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t tell her because you believed she wouldn\u2019t have come if you did, and now you\u2019re claiming you believed it wouldn\u2019t have mattered to her because she\u2019d care enough about family? Those are two entirely incompatible things.", "The daugther who didnt visted you for two years out of reasons you don't wanna say? Lol, who are you kidding?", "Again, perspective. \n\nAsk yourself WHY a child wouldn't want to see 1 of their parental units for 2 years \n\nAnd as far as you or any of us know, maybe the dad DID try to make the daughter visit her mother. I think you're focusing on the wrong thing.", "I agree with the communication part.", "You\u2019re welcome to your opinion, as we all are. How are you going to get agitated by people literally doing what she asked them to do?", "I believe that because you're a wannabe therapist mis-diagnosing other wannabe therapists for being wannabe therspists in a forum that welcomes and relies on that exact format.", "Agreed", "So you didn\u2019t go and document any actual threat legally, but instead you chose to abandon your child?", "It\u2019s not the sleeping on the couch itself\n\nIt\u2019s the feeling of displacement when your mom has moved other children into your room and you do not have any alternative space except a common area and not even a bed or mattress. \n\nLet\u2019s remember this is a kid who has been through it.", "Plenty of people grew up sharing a room. Now, everyone has to have their own. Have you seen how the poor live and sleep in other countries? No one has their own room.\n\nIf you have a roof over your head, plenty of food, clothes, and many luxuries that billions of people will never have and are still whining that sharing a bedroom is a hardship, you need to face reality, and realize you are one of the lucky ones born into this world.", "Yep such an unpopular opinion but so over adults playing house with blended families they can\u2019t find space for. Harsh, I know, but I see it so often. It\u2019s not some unavoidable conundrum. It\u2019s chosen and impacts the kids.", "It is an explanation. OP is right to repurpose the room, but she is the asshole for not telling her daughter what she\u2019d done. OP outright said she didn\u2019t tell her because she knew she wouldn\u2019t come.\n\nDaughter made an attempt to rebuild and OP showed her why it wasn\u2019t worth it.", "Communicating. She's the mother. It's on her to communicate changes, especially if they're changes that she thinks would affect her daughter's decision to come.", "There could be many reasons. Ask yourself why OP's therapist warned her to stay away from him. What kind of man is he? Why wasn't he encouraging her to see OP in 2yrs. You're so shortsighted and fixated on what OP may or may not have done that you don't want to consider any other external influences.", "So the Dad May have tried to make her visit OP, but we know for a fact that OP is the villain, because she didn't tell the daughter she'd be sleeping on the couch.", "\u201cNova was always a daddy\u2019s girl and hated being away from him\u201d \n\u201cShe was rude and misbehaving until she was 14. I asked her why\u2026she wants me to let her last be with her dad\u201d\n\nSo at 16 she decides maybe living with mom wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. What is the reason she left the dad, being a \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d and all. \n\nTeenagers can be angsty especially in these circumstances. \n\nThankfully she learned early on that actions have consequences. Should OP put her life in hold for (what sounds like) a \nManipulative child that  doesn\u2019t get her way?  The ex definitely had a responsibility on the parenting front and it sounds like he failed (actually, maybe not since the child wanted to leave-even though she was \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl). Just why would Nova, after 2 years insist on being with mom?", "Really, that\u2019s why I voted TA. She is absolutely in the right to change the room to fit the current needs of the children living there, but she was wrong to not tell her daughter.", "Whose agitated? I simply stated that the attacks on OP are disgusting.", "How do you know I'm not a therapist? But what would I expect with reasoning like yours.", "bruh i have literally shared a bed with my 3 siblings, shared rooms my whole life etc. and i can say full well my parents were not prepared for all the kids they had. it happens too often where people make ill-thought decisions concerning having children and it can affect those children for the rest of their lives. i\u2019m not saying kids without their own rooms are deprived of humanity ffs. i AM saying too many parents don\u2019t prepare properly for all of the children they CHOOSE to bring into the world.", "TOO often", "It's an excuse period. This isn't about the room, stop deflecting. So what OP didn't tell her, I don't see anything sinister in that, she doesn't live there and would be a guest. Most people get a couch or blow up mattress.\n\nIf the daughter cares about making an attempt, sleeping on the couch would not be an issue. Stop making excuses.", "So the mother needs to communicate changes that the daughter chose? Really!?", "She isn\u2019t a villain. Just the asshole in this instance.", "I mean yeah OP is objectively TA for that even if we have to make assumptions on the other details", "Welcome to Reddit.", "Your vocabulary, sentence structure, child-like conversation skills, inability to pick up context clues, lack of emotional intelligence, etc.", "It isn\u2019t sinister. It\u2019s irresponsible and deceitful. OP knew why she didn\u2019t tell her and was shocked when her daughter left. Want her to act like an adult? Treat her like one by telling her before, let her make  that decision.\n\nNope. I disagree with you. The daughter reached out, made an attempt, and she saw that she had no space in her mom\u2019s home. I don\u2019t blame her for leaving. OP can accept the consequences just like her daughter has to.", "Yeah, she isn't though.", "Could she have mentioned it, sure maybe. Did she owe the person who abandoned her and wanted nothing to do with her for 2yrs that? Either way she's NTA.", "I mean, duh!", "Eh, it's my offday", "I think that person has some serious issues tbh. No parent who cares about their child would do what OP did. Even her words were telling, \"Daddy's girl\" \"rude and misbehaving\", I mean did OP check out of parenting?", "The fact that you are making this about a damn sofa is pathetic at best. I don't see where OP should be obligated to tell her daughter who abandoned her for 2 years where she was gonna sleep. And frankly, she should be grateful she had somewhere to sleep. \n \nI don't care if you disagree, your opinion doesn't matter, and I don't take you seriously already based on your assessment. And again , if she was serious about making an attempt, she would not have run back to daddy at the 1st sign of her NOT GETTING HER WAY. She didn't have space, after 2yrs, I would expect so. Your expectations and the daughter's are beyond unreasonable. Also, OP offered her the Couch so she clearly had space. \n\nThat girl is spoiled, and clearly you're cut from the same cloth, with your line of thinking."]}
