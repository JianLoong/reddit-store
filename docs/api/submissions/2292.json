She did everything she could to make me let her live with her dad. She was rude and misbehaved until when she was 14 I told her I can't do this anymore. I asked her why she is acting like this and she said she wants me to let her live with her dad so I told her she can live with her dad but if she changes her mind she can come back. She left and didn't even come to see me for 2 years. \n\nShe called me a few weeks ago and said she wants to stay with me one or two weekends a month from now on. I told her I'm glad and I'm looking forward it.\n\nLast weekend she came home I told her she can sleep on the couch. She asked me why she can't stay in her bedroom. I told her that my boyfriend who I live with has 2 daughters and that bedroom is theirs now. The room is too small for 3 people so she has to sleep on the couch.\n\nShe called me an asshole and and said there is no way she'll sleep on the couch.

Did you ever find out why she wanted to resume visitation?", "I feel I can't really give an AH rating because I don't have enough info.

To me, even with the whole \"fun parent/strict parent\" dynamic, kids don't typically go no contact for 2 years without a reason. \n\nBut also, you did tell her if she ever wants to come back, she'd be welcomed.

No mention of when the step dad and step siblings came into the picture or anything. This is super one sided and no attempt at honesty about the entirety of the situation. Not only YTA you seem to be a manipulative one as well", "It\u2019s reasonable to repurpose a room after it\u2019s been empty for 2 years. However, reading your post and comments, I have a sneaky feeling that you - subconsciously or not - might not have communicated the couch situation to your daughter in advance and instead ambushed her with it as a way to punish her for staying away from you for 2 years. She hurt you by keeping you at a distance for so long, and you want to show her that she\u2019s been downgraded to \u201cguest\u201d level as a consequence. I understand you are hurt, OP, but you are the adult in this relationship and she is your 14yo child, which means YTA.", "YTA because you\u2019re holding back some serious details.

Dad hasn't just been the \"fun parent\" for the last two years; he's been the only parent). It sounds like she was reaching out to you to rebuild a relationship, and you responded by not bothering to tell her that she had essentially been replaced, then giving her a sleeping arrangement with no privacy, without warning, in a house with presumed strangers who are now sleeping in her old room.\n\nI'd be pretty upset if I were her. You didn't even give her full information so she could process these changes before they were right in front of her.", "it\u2019s hard to judge without hearing the daughter\u2019s side of the story", "YTA\n\n\nFor not telling her before she arrived.

Your daughter was young when you divorced and acted out to get what she wanted. Am loathe to call her an ah for that because of her age at that time. You say she didn't visit you for two years....what did you do to try and fix the relationship those two years? I think it's unreasonable for her to expected a room to have been kept for her after all this time, but you should have had this conversation long before she came over to stay. I mean, it's not very nice to have it sprung on you that you have no room once you are already there. I'm going YTA because you didn't have this conversation with her before she came over. Whilst you're not wrong about the room, I feel you could have dealt with it a lot more sensitively.", "I get the feeling that there is A LOT of info missing!", "YTA - For not telling her before", "YTA\n\nIf she was older, it would probably be a different judgment but I can\u2019t expect too much from a teenager who went through their parents divorce. \n\nThe fact that a moody, hormonal and rebellious teenager wanted to live with fun her dad is not surprising at all.

There is something you\u2019re not saying. \nIt seems to me that you moved on and replaced (for lack of a better word) your daughter with your new bf\u2019s daughters. You said she could come back whenever she wanted, yet you let your boyfriend\u2019s daughters take her room. You didn\u2019t tell her that her room was occupied, because you knew she wouldn\u2019t come if you did, so it was a shock to her and she probably feels like you\u2019ve replaced her. You manipulated her into coming with the hopes that she\u2019d just sleep on the couch instead of going home. For that, YTA.", "YTA - partly for not keeping the room for her- you clearly needed it, but you had told her she could come back if she wanted, but mostly because you never told her in advance. She\u2019s 16. She wants, needs, and deserves some privacy. Of course she isn\u2019t going to choose to sleep on the couch if she has a room at her dad\u2019s. if you want her to come and see you, it\u2019s on you to make her welcome. I\u2019m starting to see why she wanted to live with her dad, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s the fun one.

It might be a shock to her, no doubt, but is she gets the bedroom then what about the 2 other kids? They live there full time, she can handle two nights a month on the couch.

You love your daughter but you cant plan life around the possibility of her coming back. The only criticism I hafmve fir you is that there should've been a conversation about the changes in your living situation when she first brought up visiting. I think you should've told her that there are 3 new people in the household. Two of those people now occupy the bedroom that she had previously used. She has the option of bunking with the them (try it for obe night to see if it's workable) or taking the couch but you're not kicking your stepdaughters out of their room. If the sleeping arrangements are not to her liking, she can do day visits instead. Dad drops her off in the morning and picks up in the evening. There are two other parts to this conversation. One: why has her mind changed. Does she genuinely want to rebuild your relationship or has something changed at dad's place? Two: how she treats you.", "Nta point out she stayed away for 2 years and the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her", "Stop with yta comments OP said she tried multiple times within the 2 years and her daughter wouldn\u2019t come back or made excuses read the comment when OP answered instead of jumping to that verdict you guys are the assholes she had her daughter outright disrespect her just so could go to her dads I know OP was devastated and still is and you guys on jumping her when she fought as hard as she could and the daughter is the AH for thinking her mother wouldn\u2019t move on", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
