I got custody and he only had visitations. Nova was always a daddy's girl and hated being away from him and when we got divorced he was free to play the fun parent for her so it got even worse. She did everything she could to make me let her live with her dad. She was rude and misbehaved until when she was 14 I told her I can't do this anymore. I asked her why she is acting like this and she said she wants me to let her live with her dad so I told her she can live with her dad but if she changes her mind she can come back. She left and didn't even come to see me for 2 years. \n\nShe called me a few weeks ago and said she wants to stay with me one or two weekends a month from now on. I told her I'm glad and I'm looking forward it.\n\nLast weekend she came home I told her she can sleep on the couch. She asked me why she can't stay in her bedroom. I told her that my boyfriend who I live with has 2 daughters and that bedroom is theirs now. The room is too small for 3 people so she has to sleep on the couch.\n\nShe called me an asshole and and said there is no way she'll sleep on the couch. She called her dad who picked her up in an hour and left.\n\nShe sent me a text and said since I don't have a place for her in my home, she won't come back\n\nI think she is acting very entitled because she left and didn't come back for 2 years. She can't expect me to keep her room empty\n\nEdit: I called my daughter to apologize for not telling her about the room situation sooner and offer to do something together. It didn't go well. She was screaming at me the entire time for \"not wanting her\" and told me she doesn't want to see me again and wants to stay with the parent who \"actually loves her\" I tried to explain to her that it's not true and I love her and I want her but she hung up the phone and I think she's blocked me.\n\nI didn't want to talk to her dad so I called her grandparents to ask them to get her to talk to me. They refused and accused me of being neglectful and told me they are against her coming back to my home. \n\nI don't know what else to do and I really want to be done with this family but I'll keep trying to talk to her and see what we can do", "created_utc": 1668424152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuw2eg/aita_for_not_keeping_my_daughters_room_empty_when/", "score": 1337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, reading your post and comments, I have a sneaky feeling that you - subconsciously or not - might not have communicated the couch situation to your daughter in advance and instead ambushed her with it as a way to punish her for staying away from you for 2 years. She hurt you by keeping you at a distance for so long, and you want to show her that she\u2019s been downgraded to \u201cguest\u201d level as a consequence.

You say she didn't visit you for two years....what did you do to try and fix the relationship those two years? I think it's unreasonable for her to expected a room to have been kept for her after all this time, but you should have had this conversation long before she came over to stay. I mean, it's not very nice to have it sprung on you that you have no room once you are already there. I'm going YTA because you didn't have this conversation with her before she came over.

You didn\u2019t tell her that her room was occupied, because you knew she wouldn\u2019t come if you did, so it was a shock to her and she probably feels like you\u2019ve replaced her. You manipulated her into coming with the hopes that she\u2019d just sleep on the couch instead of going home. For that, YTA.", "YTA - partly for not keeping the room for her- you clearly needed it, but you had told her she could come back if she wanted, but mostly because you never told her in advance. She\u2019s 16. She wants, needs, and deserves some privacy. Of course she isn\u2019t going to choose to sleep on the couch if she has a room at her dad\u2019s. if you want her to come and see you, it\u2019s on you to make her welcome. I\u2019m starting to see why she wanted to live with her dad, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s the fun one.

You love your daughter but you cant plan life around the possibility of her coming back. The only criticism I hafmve fir you is that there should've been a conversation about the changes in your living situation when she first brought up visiting. I think you should've told her that there are 3 new people in the household. Two of those people now occupy the bedroom that she had previously used. She has the option of bunking with the them (try it for obe night to see if it's workable) or taking the couch but you're not kicking your stepdaughters out of their room. If the sleeping arrangements are not to her liking, she can do day visits instead. Dad drops her off in the morning and picks up in the evening. There are two other parts to this conversation. One: why has her mind changed. Does she genuinely want to rebuild your relationship or has something changed at dad's place? Two: how she treats you.", "Nta point out she stayed away for 2 years and the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her", "Stop with yta comments OP said she tried multiple times within the 2 years and her daughter wouldn\u2019t come back or made excuses read the comment when OP answered instead of jumping to that verdict you guys are the assholes she had her daughter outright disrespect her just so could go to her dads I know OP was devastated and still is and you guys on jumping her when she fought as hard as she could and the daughter is the AH for thinking her mother wouldn\u2019t move on", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why have kids at all, knowing that they\u2019ll eventually be moody teens?\n\nAnd forcing her to sleep on the couch is such a passive aggressive move, basically like she\u2019s being told she\u2019s a dog who isn\u2019t allowed upstairs because she\u2019s been bad. And honestly, how would someone NOT feel outraged and replaced by this? You\u2019re essentially telling her that your bf and his daughters take precedent over her and that they\u2019re your \u2018actual\u2019 family now.\n\nThe fact you can\u2019t see the wrong in what you did and the fact you\u2019re blaming a 14 yr old child about her upset response is extremely telling about your personality and character. How are you the victim in this, even slightly? I\u2019m guessing you feel like everyone else is always the problem, huh?\n\nNarc parents do stuff like this and can\u2019t understand why their kids don\u2019t want contact with them or put them in nursing homes. You\u2019ve sent this vulnerable child a very loud and clear message that she isn\u2019t important in your life and that she\u2019s unwanted. Don\u2019t be surprised if she turns into a massively troubled adult who will look for validation and love in all the wrong people. \n\nBut yeah, glad your bf and his daughters are enjoying her space! \n\nYTA.", "The disgusting responses attacking OP is quite unbelievable.

She\u2019s a teenager and not a mature adult and it\u2019s logical.

Especially if you feared her father would ever be abusive to her. She needs to know that you are there and will always be and making no effort to be in her life is communicating the opposite. \n\nFor the future, you need to speak to her about sharing attendance to school events with her father (ie he goes to one, you go to other) and meeting up to do something that she enjoys and you can bond more.

Nobody can easily save a needed room incase someone might come back especially when there is people who need and will use that room.\nIn saying that as a parent the excuse you didn't see her for 2 years doesn't actually wash.

Honestly you're an asshole. The whole room being occupied by your boyfriend's daughters is just surface level, but it's a symptom of a bigger issue. So here's my 2 cents. You're daughter was misbehaving, and acting out. Uhm she's a teenager, and trying to push boundaries, you also have to factor in the divorce, and the fallout that came from it. So the whole relationship stalled out when she was 14, and moved out to live with her dad. In the ensuing 2 years you say you've reached out, and she blew you off so you gave up. How long was it that you gave up? She reached out to visit, and you didn't tell her that your boyfriend, and kids moved in, until she showed up. Then you say she got mad because they moved into her old room. Which on the surface yeah don't let space go to waste, but that also gives off the vibe she's been REPLACED. So now you're saying she's being an ass because she didn't have her space anymore. Well there's a saying in my family. A house has 4 walls, the people inside make it a home. And to her it probably seems like you gained you're own little instant family, and she's just the odd one out. \n\nDid you guys go to therapy after the divorce? Some kids are resilient when things like that occur, but if it gets messy that adds a lot of stress on to everybody, and it probably strained your relationship more then you know. \n\nAlso in the comments you talk about how well behaved your boyfriend's daughters are, and how ill behaved your own daughter is, and how you let her go to someone who was abusive to you. You also said your therapist said to maintain minimal contact with him, when people asked why you didn't maintain a line with your daughter. Could you have I don't know asked any of his immediate family like one of your daughter's grandparents to be an intermediary?\n\nSo TLDR the room is just a surface issue, it's the fact that your daughter probably has some unresolved issues caused by your divorce, and you maintained minimal contact in the last 2 years. She finally reached out to you, and you lied to her about the new dynamic, and when she showed up, it's like surprise here's my new family. So it feels like she was replaced.

You might be able to repair this relationship, but I'm not going to lie you really screwed up by not communicating effectively, and admitting you gave up on her.", "You didn't see your daughter for two years?

I think you might have been overlooking the subtext of your daughter's behaviour.\n\n2-4 days a month on the couch is not a big deal, but I agree with comments that suggest this is not about the couch as it is about your daughter no longer feeling like there is an unconditional place (love) for her at your house. Perhaps there is something going on at her dad's that led to her reaching out, be it for some independence, a want for a motherly (or specifically, your) presence, or her dad bringing someone new into his life.\n\nWhatever the reason, as soon as she took you up on your standing welcome, you should've put a bit more effort into making her feel welcome. Even if it meant she wouldn't come see you immediately, you should still have told your daughter about the bedroom situation beforehand, and discussed with her to ensure her needs are being considered. You had a few weeks to get things in order before relegating her to the couch.\n\nMaybe you could've met with her elsewhere for a mother-daughter weekend away instead, if no agreement could be made about the situation at home.\n\nI can appreciate the difficult situation you're in, and the history of behaviour that led to a lack of faith, but if you really meant what you said about her coming back whenever she wanted, you must walk the talk.\n\nYou mentioned her dad getting to play the \"fun\" parent, so maybe she's more used to getting her way. It's unfortunate that she's not more remorseful for intentionally acting out to make you give up custody, or understanding of your pain and need to move on with your life, although it could also have been her testing your love.
