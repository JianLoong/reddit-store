Judy never wanted kids but I did and I assumed she did too. We had her and Judy completely changed, she wasn't caring toward Scarlet, they didn't bond and she blamed Scarlet for us losing our independence. About a year after, we had a divorce and she gave me everything. It did hurt me that she didn't even want to see Scarlet once a year even. She moved to Seattle months after, started running a business, got really fit, her cousin told me she even got laser surgery to remove her stretch marks.\n\nSince then, Judy has moved to LA and divides her time between there, London, Mumbai and NYC. She has become a fairly famous influencer and socialite. I check her instagram every now and then and she's been at parties with celebrities all over the world and truly seems happy. To her credit, every time her financial situation changed, she would come back and get our child support agreement changed to give more to Scarlet. Every time she'd come, she would spend time with Scarlet. She even kept it the same even though my new wife makes a lot more money than both of us and we don't need it now.\n\nAbout three years ago, she started calling more to talk to Scarlet. She would also come over more and every spring break, she comes for those two weeks. She phones every night unless she's in London, Mumbai or NYC - in which case she just sends a text. On New Years, she was at some celebrity's party but still took the time to phone. Now, I'm not saying that this makes up for anything but she has been a presence in Scarlet's life.\n\nWell, we just found out that Judy's grandfather is very ill and he's going to pass away within a month, maybe early March at best. So, she's going to India for spring break for his funeral and has requested to take Scarlet with her. I'm fine with that, my wife is fine with that. However, Scarlet got really upset at the idea of spending two weeks in India. I pointed out her mom will take her to all the nice places, she'll get to see great things, meet that part of her family. But she said that it's not fair. So, I pointed out that at the very least, she can get whatever she wants out of her mom in those two weeks.\n\nMy wife overheard and said I was an asshole for telling Scarlet that it's all right for her to use her  mom for cash since she has barely been in her life. I pointed out I didn't say that but we argued and since then, I realize what I said kind of did amount to that. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Judy never told me she did not want kids. She allowed me to believe she did. If I knew she didn't, we would never have gotten married.", "created_utc": 1674589089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ke1tu/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_its_okay_to_use_her/", "score": 3128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They spend this time together every year.\n\nThere's also no indication that she will be forced to go, if anything OP used an underhanded argument about material benefits to try to CONVINCE the daughter to go.

You want to utilize her to \"get what she wants\" from going on this trip when your kid already told you what she wants to do- not go on this trip. \n\nFact is that your ex never wanted kids, you did. You assumed she would change her mind, she didn't. She isn't a bad person for walking away when she knew she wasn't going to be a good mother figure for your daughter.

Staying just to stay isn't the right thing to always do. \n\nYTA because this is something you want instead of what's best for the situation all the way around.

I didnt interpret it as \"you can use your father for money\" like a lot of people in the comments are saying, but rather, he has the means to take me places I would never go otherwise, and afford things for me to have a good trip. The way you said it might have been a bit clumsy, so if you have doubts, maybe clear the air with her.

And really truly listen. Don't belittle her feelings or make them seem invalid. Validate them and if necessary give her facts that either support or disprove those fears are needed or not. Let her know they are legitimate either way but that not all fears are founded in truth. There are so many things that could really be going on in her mind that are hard for a 13 year old to voice. She may be 13 but remember she's ONLY 13. Going to meet all these people for a funeral may not be the best time to go on this trip. Maybe it's too long of a trip for someone her age maybe she'd like more time to plan or a smaller closer to home fun trip with her mom first to see if they are even compatible to vacation with or if they'd bump heads the entire time.

While my sister was visiting, even while he was chaperoning her, her white skin caused such a stir that she was frequently groped and sexually assaulted - men would come up and grab her breasts, her butt, one guy even grabbed at her vagina in the marketplace! And these all happened while he very large and fierce looking Indian husband was standing right there. I shudder to think what might have happened if he wasn't there.", "Because family *never* sexually assaulted family, right? I *totally* don't have a cousin whose dad was my great uncle.", "No one is glossing over it. We\u2019re saying that if the roles were reversed them people would be saying that the mom is wrong because dad made it known that he didn\u2019t want kids but she kept it so financial support should be enough. \n\nHe knew that she didn\u2019t want a child. He tried to backtrack and say that she never said she didn\u2019t want kids and she let him believe she did. It sounds like he knew she didn\u2019t want kids but when she got pregnant he convinced her to keep it. Knowing she didn\u2019t want it. And then when the kid was born he realized she was serious about not wanting kids. She\u2019s doing her responsibilities as the non custodial parent. But OP sounds like the many men on this sub that coerce their wives to keep babies and then act surprised when they don\u2019t want them. She probably expressed throughout the pregnancy that she didn\u2019t want kids. \n\nBut alas, a lot of men don\u2019t take women seriously when they say they don\u2019t want kids. Because what women doesn\u2019t want a baby.", "Again, it matters in the same way it would matter if it were _any_ foreign country. Or are you saying Indian families are more likely to throw a kid out onto the street? You are biased and it shows", "Bro stop inventing as stories to supplement your argument. You mean to tell me a crowd descended on her and your BIL just watched? You have watched waaaay too much true crime.\n\nAnd calling it a third world country is racist. It's not my problem if you refuse to believe it. Also love the fact that the people with the loudest arguments are the ones who have never spent a day in India", "So by your logic French families never sexually assault their families right?", "This is the comment I needed. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to go a state away to go watch a distant family member die, much less the other side of the world. And I\u2019m a full ass grown adult. I can\u2019t even imagine that as a teenager.", "You don't understand one raising a child at all and two being a child at all. Why would a child see you as anything other than a monetary purpose in life when you practically refuse your own child a relationship with you?", "I\u2019m sorry but he didn\u2019t say he was making his daughter go. He said he tried to convince her. She\u2019s old enough. I try and convince my kids to do all sorts of things I think they will end up loving. If they are dead set against, I don\u2019t push then, but if they are like \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Mexico for spring break grandma and grandpa and my cousins,\u201d I\u2019m like but did you know there will be surfing and great food and everything else? Kids don\u2019t know things. If they are certain that\u2019s one thing. Nothing wrong with trying to convince your kids to push their comfort zone safe and healthy ways. She spends time every year with her mom and wants to spend time with her mom on spring break per other comments, she just is like wait what India?", "Lotta people read what they wanted to read, didn\u2019t they?", "Doesn\u2019t matter if she wanted a kid or not. She had one and has pretty much abandoned responsibility and dropped the heavy lifting on him. I highly doubt a man wanting to detach from his child would be treated the same way here.", "Especially as it's a funeral for someone she likely never knew. How is that fair to force a kid to go to such?\n\nHell, even in my 20s, when both of my maternal grandparents died, I didn't want to go to their funeral because I had complicated relationships with them. I only was willing because I'm fond of a lot of my maternal family and they live half way across the world, but I do consider my mother's country as a second home. If I had never been to the country before, did not have family there that I love... I would not have gone.", "I get what you're saying here, but did you not notice Scarlett's age here when Judy started reaching out more... Judy is trying to establish a relationship now because Scarlett is \"interesting\" now... I wouldn't be surprised that if Scarlett does go on the trip, Judy will try to be less parent and more \"girlfriends.\" OP said she was a socialite and influencer. \"Look at me partying with my daughter. Tell me how amazing I am as a mother and how you wish you had a relationship where you could go out with your daughter like this.\"", "\n>his job as a parent is to sometimes make children do things they don't want to do in their own best interest\n\nYES!! 13 year old me would have been super reluctant to make this trip too, but it will be awesome for OPs daughter. I know I'd have balked because when I was 13, mom signed me up for this new summer camp that I adamantly DID NOT want to go to. Pitched a hissy fit and everything. Guess who had an awesome time at camp, did cool stuff I didn't think possible, and went back for another 5 years as not just a camper but later a counselor?\n\nNAH, I think Judy is finally seeing her kid as not just a child, ergo someone relatable. OP knows this will be a good experience. And Scarlett is 13, she doesn't know what does doesn't know.", "ive seen ppl calling him a deadbeat when he takes care of her primarily and is clearly the more present parent lmao. people on here are delusional", "Not everyone has to parent. Man or woman, if they voluntarily send at least their child support, then I would call them a decent person. Just because you have a baby doesn't mean you have to be a parent. Adoption or giving the baby to the other parent.", "Bc the bar for men is much much lower.", "YTA, but I'm going to be as objective as possible. \n\nIt's not the time to persuade your daughter to go on a trip. It It could defenitly be fun, but it's also a funeral. Despite what the movies tell you this isnt vacation material. If her lack of comfort is COMPLETELY understandable. \n\nYou can both talk to your ex (separate or together) explain that your daughter is really uncomfortable, and plan a trip for them to take next year. You can even get your daughter in on it and have her save up her own spending money. \n\n It's good to push your daughter out of her comfort zone, but things like relationships and abandoment issues take time. Your daughter should bond with her mom but, at her own comfort. Maybe start by encouraging her to share her feelings about the trip with her mom. This gives mom the opportunity to show how she acts in tough situations. \n\nThe way you approached the topic defenitly made YTA. If you really did mispeak you need to explain that to your daughter. \n\nYou essentially told her that she should squeeze everything she can out of the situation. Is that really the life lesson you want to teach her? \n\nYou need to listen to your wife and follow her league on this. You clearly married a good woman. If she's telling you your moral compass is off you need to listen.", "Knew I would find such a comment in the thread the moment I read the travel was to India. Even with the edit, the comment is in poor taste.", "Covert racism. India is intimidating but England is not. Wow.", "Assumptions are the biggest problem of this sub huh..", "to be fair, funerals in india often feature parades lol", "So if you don\u2019t want kids, but you have one, instead of financially supporting them while their other parent raises them, it\u2019s better to be a daily presence in their life while you become more and more miserable and resentful every day?", "I'm not sure if you're aware of this but a certain political party is forcing people to give birth to kids they don't want so you're only going to see more unwanted kids at this rate.", "I absolutely agree with the above commenter, as the child of an absent father. My bio dad didn\u2019t want me and noped out. That\u2019s fine. I would rather not have a father than have one who doesn\u2019t want to be there.\n\nIn an ideal world, nobody would have kids they don\u2019t want, but this isn\u2019t an ideal world and shit happens. \n\nThe only thing that makes my biodad a dick is that he fought tooth and nail to avoid paying child support.", "The daughter doesn\u2019t dread spending time with her mom at all. She *wants* to spend time with her. In fact, the reason she doesn\u2019t want to go is because she won\u2019t have her mom\u2019s undivided attention and doesn\u2019t want to share her with the extended family.", "This subreddit is too self-aware of its biases and would never have double standards. Never.", "Man abandons kid: AH\nWoman: we need to read between the lines", "Judy has moved to LA and divides her time between there, London, Mumbai   \nand NYC. She has become a fairly famous influencer and socialite.

No argument there", "Also... God I hate that I'm this person and where my mind goes but... Isn't arranged marriage pretty big in India still? And thirteen wouldn't necessarily be too young in some cultures... Seems kind of sketchy to me that Mom came back in her life somlate and wants to be buddy buddy and take her someplace like this right when she's developing...", "That still has nothing to do with your comment about someone abandoning their child being a decent humane when that is the only thing you know about them. Take some accountability and responsibility", "Someone can't read...", "That reminds me:\n\n13yo dont want to go to funerals either.\n\nBut, wait for it, you're gonna love this one: YOU MAKE THEM.", "Obviously i know nothing about her mom, noir her reasons. But I\u2019m going to assume that they are completely valid reasons, she wants to spend time with her child and she needs to visit a relative because of the impending death in the family. \n\nDoesnt make India any less of an intimidating country to visit. But people are trying to make it out like going to India with someone who\u2019s a halftime parent (at best) to a family you have never even met, in a country with a different language and culture, and the state India is in isnt intimidating and thats just disingenuous.", "Kids that aren't wanted get abandoned.
