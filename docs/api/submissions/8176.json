Judy never wanted kids but I did and I assumed she did too. We had her and Judy completely changed, she wasn't caring toward Scarlet, they didn't bond and she blamed Scarlet for us losing our independence. About a year after, we had a divorce and she gave me everything. It did hurt me that she didn't even want to see Scarlet once a year even. She moved to Seattle months after, started running a business, got really fit, her cousin told me she even got laser surgery to remove her stretch marks.\n\nSince then, Judy has moved to LA and divides her time between there, London, Mumbai and NYC. She has become a fairly famous influencer and socialite. I check her instagram every now and then and she's been at parties with celebrities all over the world and truly seems happy. To her credit, every time her financial situation changed, she would come back and get our child support agreement changed to give more to Scarlet. Every time she'd come, she would spend time with Scarlet. She even kept it the same even though my new wife makes a lot more money than both of us and we don't need it now.\n\nAbout three years ago, she started calling more to talk to Scarlet. She would also come over more and every spring break, she comes for those two weeks. She phones every night unless she's in London, Mumbai or NYC - in which case she just sends a text. On New Years, she was at some celebrity's party but still took the time to phone. Now, I'm not saying that this makes up for anything but she has been a presence in Scarlet's life.\n\nWell, we just found out that Judy's grandfather is very ill and he's going to pass away within a month, maybe early March at best. So, she's going to India for spring break for his funeral and has requested to take Scarlet with her. I'm fine with that, my wife is fine with that. However, Scarlet got really upset at the idea of spending two weeks in India. I pointed out her mom will take her to all the nice places, she'll get to see great things, meet that part of her family. But she said that it's not fair. So, I pointed out that at the very least, she can get whatever she wants out of her mom in those two weeks.\n\nMy wife overheard and said I was an asshole for telling Scarlet that it's all right for her to use her  mom for cash since she has barely been in her life. I pointed out I didn't say that but we argued and since then, I realize what I said kind of did amount to that. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Judy never told me she did not want kids. She allowed me to believe she did. If I knew she didn't, we would never have gotten married.", "created_utc": 1674589089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ke1tu/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_its_okay_to_use_her/", "score": 821, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They spend this time together every year.\n\nThere's also no indication that she will be forced to go, if anything OP used an underhanded argument about material benefits to try to CONVINCE the daughter to go.

You want to utilize her to \"get what she wants\" from going on this trip when your kid already told you what she wants to do- not go on this trip. \n\nFact is that your ex never wanted kids, you did. You assumed she would change her mind, she didn't. She isn't a bad person for walking away when she knew she wasn't going to be a good mother figure for your daughter.

Staying just to stay isn't the right thing to always do. \n\nYTA because this is something you want instead of what's best for the situation all the way around.

I didnt interpret it as \"you can use your father for money\" like a lot of people in the comments are saying, but rather, he has the means to take me places I would never go otherwise, and afford things for me to have a good trip. The way you said it might have been a bit clumsy, so if you have doubts, maybe clear the air with her.

Its not my opinion but the prevalent opinion of this sub, but only when its a man in question.", "Ironically, no it wouldn't. No one has even lobbed the term \"gold digger\" at op. Women who ask for *child support* are regularly called gold diggers.", "He didn\u2019t call her that, wtf. He said she\u2019ll buy you anything you want like TOURIST shit and nice FOOD. He\u2019s not saying take her to the auto dealership and come back with a Tesla.\n\nI doubt he\u2019d double down in real life, but the ridiculous condemnation of keyboard warriors would cause anyone to double down.", "Maybe. Maybe I'm from Odessa and just lying about details. My point is that she's not spending time in a village but in amazing cities.", "Okay, I will concede that she is meeting the state ordered minimum responsibility and is therefore not a deadbeat. \n\nIt\u2019s nice and very generous that she\u2019s not a criminal, but uh\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make her a good person or someone worthy of valiant defense.", "When the relative is old enough, a funeral is just a great reason for a family reunion!", "Did she pretend, or did you just assume and never really talk about it? Someone who would force his child into an uncomfortable trip, I could absolutely see you just breezing past your ex's desires and wishes....", "I can\u2019t even imagine how disappointing this was for you and now your daughter, since you were together for so long. I\u2019m assuming she thought she\u2019d change her mind.", "Sorry OP, that sounds terrible. Screw the downvoters you sound like a good dude that got put in a shitty situation through your ex wife being dishonest about life goals. \n\nEx wife is the asshole here for abandoning daughter then coming back after the hardest work is done. I\u2019m sure you want the best for your daughter through her relationships and influence, just don\u2019t forget about the sacrifice your wife has made to help raise her when your ex wasn\u2019t there.", "Apologies, I don't know if I missed the edit or what, but I see it now.", "My apologies. I don't recall reading that edit, so I don't know if it was added after I commented or if I just missed it. I didn't read too far down because I didn't have time, so I didn't see many of OP's replies.", "Not obligated. Which is why I think k what the dad is doing is messed up. Send his teenage daughter away for two weeks to India, with a woman who has never been there?", "You're absolutely right. I was too focused on \"dad\" from the post I was responding to.", "Yes and we have also defined parents who wake up from their mistakes. Whice sounds like what this mom is doing. More visits, more calls, asking her to come.", "Because we aren't allowed to tell the truth when it comes to certain double standards on reddit\n\nOr have fun with it at least", "What is funny about it and what do you mean when you say it\u2019s \u201cpretty true\u201d?", "\nI would have preferred my dead beat dad help my mom financially so she wasn't working two jobs and rolling coins for food. I'm a real dick. A parent that doesn't want to be one at least paying for them, is a better case. \n He would still be a dead beat but at least he would have taken accountability for his actions. Like this egg donor has done.", "My dad was gone a lot because he'd rather work/be with other women than with my mom, sisters and I. When he was around, he resented the fuck out of us. So, as someone who has gone through both, I 100% preferred when he was away.\n\nIt's not hard to realize that, in a shitty situation, you got the better end of the shit stick. Yes, not having both parents sucks, but it's better than a parent actively hating you instead. Seeing that perspective is just as important.", "Do you know how many people ignore this lawful obligation? A lot of people", "Please. Men get away with oodles more. Look at op here. Why didn\u2019t he ask his wife if she wanted kids? Also, if a dad here gets involved with their kid later in life after not paying child support. A number of people defend him. This woman is willingly paying child support, increases it willingly, and is now taking to her kid. Yeah, it\u2019s a low bar but many don\u2019t even go that high.", ">That\u2019s obviously not what he wanted.\n\ndid you read the title of the post?", "It honestly doesn't matter where she would be spending time because she *doesn't want to go*. Listen to her.", "People are not saying she is saint. They are saying that she is not deadbeat. Because deadbeat dad was expression specifically used for dads that did not paid child support. It was not expression used for absent uncaring dads.", "I agree with you and I apologize for being a pedant.", "Apparently she visits, calls and texts every night, and ups the child support when needed. I don\u2019t think she qualifies as a dead beat.", "This one pays child support willingly, chats with her kid, continually kept in touch. She's hardly trash. Honestly, OP was an idiot. You didn't ASK your wife if she wanted kids?", "But not if the kid going wants to spend time with her mom instead of a big group of people she doesn\u2019t know.", "She pretended. She acted like she was so happy, like it was the best thing in the world for us. Then, when she finally admitted it she even showed me her diary where she had entries about hating how she had to pretend to make me happy. If I knew she never wanted kids, I never would've married her.", "Well to be fair to the mum, OP never mentioned her race. But her grandfathers funeral is in India, it would be fair to assume she has Indian heritage.", "Its ok, no worries. Have a nice day.", "Does it? It sounds like she is doing just above the bare minimum. Hanging out and spoiling a kid for two weeks a year is more of a fun aunt kind of thing than any real semblance of parenting. \n\nI agree, it\u2019s nice that she\u2019s putting in more effort, but it is still basically nothing and honestly seems almost more selfish.", "So what is your point in relation to this thread? The mom is TA but \"it could be worse\"? I'm sure that makes the daughter feel a lot better.\n    \nI am sorry for you circumstances but that story doesn't really add anything to the present conversation and is certainly no excuse to be sexist.", "You're completely right, and I'm not saying otherwise. I'm saying the mother in question of this post is an AH, just because there are bigger AHs out there changes absolutely nothing.", "And that makes it okay for people who do pay of being selfish? Lot of deluded people in here.", "No they dont. I still remember that post where OPs boyfriend ate her LEFTOVER cake and people were demonizing him. Youd think hes Hitler by the absolute vitriol in those comments. So no, people will foam at the mouth here when its a man doing anything even resembling a wrong action. Someone actually proved the bias this and other advice-based subs have towards women but sure, keep telling yourself it doesnt exist. There is currently a thread about a man wanting his fiancee to deliver her part of a deal and people are simply ignoring what he is saying and telling him what *actually\" happened to fit their narratives.", "Titles are clickbait, and I generally will focus on what is in the actual post. Half the time titles are grossly misleading.\n\nI just don\u2019t believe any real father would say that to his kid. If the title is expected to be what he claims to have said, I\u2019d say this story is fake.", "Do you know that that is something women do because society expects it of us right? We are not allowed to be happy without kids and we are expected to pretend to be happy until we are.", "Yes I came to that conclusion as well. But the daughter had never met them or spent any time with her party egg donor. What child would feel comfortable doing that, even with getting whatever they want?", "\ud83d\ude42 You, too!", "OP *did write* the title tho.", "\u201cI just don\u2019t believe any real father would say that to his kid\u201d\n\nYou must have either had a very good upbringing and can\u2019t imagine parents saying these things or very naive!", "That indeed, the daughter is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Hopefully she gets to stay in the States, a very reasonable request.", "\u2018Use your mom for her money\u2019 - nope, can\u2019t imagine it. Teaching your kid to use their parents for money\u2026 would just lead to them taking your money. \n\nIts just not logical, on top of being absurd from a moral perspective."]}
