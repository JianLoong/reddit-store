Judy never wanted kids but I did and I assumed she did too. We had her and Judy completely changed, she wasn't caring toward Scarlet, they didn't bond and she blamed Scarlet for us losing our independence. About a year after, we had a divorce and she gave me everything. It did hurt me that she didn't even want to see Scarlet once a year even. She moved to Seattle months after, started running a business, got really fit, her cousin told me she even got laser surgery to remove her stretch marks.\n\nSince then, Judy has moved to LA and divides her time between there, London, Mumbai and NYC. She has become a fairly famous influencer and socialite. I check her instagram every now and then and she's been at parties with celebrities all over the world and truly seems happy. To her credit, every time her financial situation changed, she would come back and get our child support agreement changed to give more to Scarlet. Every time she'd come, she would spend time with Scarlet. She even kept it the same even though my new wife makes a lot more money than both of us and we don't need it now.\n\nAbout three years ago, she started calling more to talk to Scarlet. She would also come over more and every spring break, she comes for those two weeks. She phones every night unless she's in London, Mumbai or NYC - in which case she just sends a text. On New Years, she was at some celebrity's party but still took the time to phone. Now, I'm not saying that this makes up for anything but she has been a presence in Scarlet's life.\n\nWell, we just found out that Judy's grandfather is very ill and he's going to pass away within a month, maybe early March at best. So, she's going to India for spring break for his funeral and has requested to take Scarlet with her. I'm fine with that, my wife is fine with that. However, Scarlet got really upset at the idea of spending two weeks in India. I pointed out her mom will take her to all the nice places, she'll get to see great things, meet that part of her family. But she said that it's not fair. So, I pointed out that at the very least, she can get whatever she wants out of her mom in those two weeks.\n\nMy wife overheard and said I was an asshole for telling Scarlet that it's all right for her to use her  mom for cash since she has barely been in her life. I pointed out I didn't say that but we argued and since then, I realize what I said kind of did amount to that. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Judy never told me she did not want kids. She allowed me to believe she did. If I knew she didn't, we would never have gotten married.", "created_utc": 1674589089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ke1tu/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_its_okay_to_use_her/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They spend this time together every year.\n\nThere's also no indication that she will be forced to go, if anything OP used an underhanded argument about material benefits to try to CONVINCE the daughter to go.

You want to utilize her to \"get what she wants\" from going on this trip when your kid already told you what she wants to do- not go on this trip. \n\nFact is that your ex never wanted kids, you did. You assumed she would change her mind, she didn't. She isn't a bad person for walking away when she knew she wasn't going to be a good mother figure for your daughter. It may seem like an ass move but it was the right move. She pays her financial portion and keeps distance because she knows that's the best option all around.

Staying just to stay isn't the right thing to always do. \n\nYTA because this is something you want instead of what's best for the situation all the way around.

I didnt interpret it as \"you can use your father for money\" like a lot of people in the comments are saying, but rather, he has the means to take me places I would never go otherwise, and afford things for me to have a good trip. The way you said it might have been a bit clumsy, so if you have doubts, maybe clear the air with her.

She has expressed discomfort over going and I honestly don\u2019t see what difference it would make whether she goes or not. Some people think it is good to see the world, but it also isn\u2019t bad to stay in areas where you are comfortable. Like for example, I am ok traveling in the states, but once I go past there I get a little iffy, because people have different laws, customs, and languages. Sure technology is great and all too for helping with traveling now, but pushing people out of their comfort zones isn\u2019t always good for them.

Speaking as someone who did have to do that at your kid's age, it's a lot.\n\nIt's even harder when you're not secure in the time you have and the feelings your other parent has for you. Your kid is disconnected from all that, and from what she's saying, she doesn't want to feel connected.\n\nYour comment about the money is completely inappropriate, because the things she probably wants from her mom have nothing to do with money and material objects. How do you buy her mom's presence in her life growing up, or calling these relatives weekly so at least you speak the language and know who you're meeting? Feeling at home in a foreign street market? Hearing your parent speak about their childhoods and seeing the places they grew up in? Your kid can't.\n\nYou've been talking a lot about obligation and requirements, and if I remember being a young teen correctly, that's not at all enticing. Her mom should be asking for her support because of her family's death, that she regrets not being able to introduce her kid to her family earlier, all the stories about her family members and the opportunities to make new ones. She should probably also be explaining (somehow) that her flying for a funeral does not mean she's choosing something *else* over her kid.\n\nYou both have a lot of making up to do.

But at this point in your daughter's life, their relationship should be on her terms, not on your terms, not on her bio mother's, or in favor of money/experience.
