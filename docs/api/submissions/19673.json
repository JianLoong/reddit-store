{"id": 19673, "submission_id": "149c878", "title": "WIBTA if I reported the delivery driver who keeps showing up at my door in the middle of the night?", "selftext": "Around the end of last year one of the local fast food places started doing deliveries and I (38F), took advantage of the convenience. Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy (we'll call him Ronald, mid 40'sM) bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\n\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\n\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\n\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\n\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\n\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\n\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone. But I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that knocking on a woman's door late at night when she's not expecting you is a bad thing, and after three times, I can't just ignore this anymore.\n\nSo, wibta if I reported him?", "created_utc": 1686760003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c878/wibta_if_i_reported_the_delivery_driver_who_keeps/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Delivery services aren't supposed to mark and check up on addresses they get while on the job. He got her address while on the clock and so any harassment of OP does need to be told to his employer because OP might not be the only prior delivery address he's doing this to. And also on the basis that people like this shouldn't have unfettered access to addresses, names, and phone numbers like this. If it's one of the big 3 (door dash, uber eats, postmates) they even have policies stating that drivers doing this will be fired. It's privacy policy.", "Absolutely reason to alert his job. She might not be the only one he's stalking.", "NTA\n\nOP, this is very serious so please read this.\n\nFirst of all: A delivery person (or anyone really) should never show up at a customer's place for reasons outside of their job. That's highly inappropriate, a breach of privacy and boundaries, unprofessional and creepy. You would have been right to report him the first time he showed up. This is the kind of situation where he 100% knows better and you'd be completely right to report him to his employer and to the police (they can't do much for the first time he shows up, but you at least want them to start a paper trail).\n\nWith that out of the way, here is what you must understand: **you are in a dangerous situation**. This man is a creep and a stalker. He's not doing what he does because he is dumb or clueless, he's doing it because he has an unhealthy fixation on you and no concern for boundaries. Since he is already showing up at your home repeatedly, there's a strong risk he'll escalate. **He could end up assaulting you**. \n\n**You need to take your safety very seriously at this moment**. You must report him or it will only get worse, but you also need to be prepared for his reaction once you do. Because of course, he won't like it when you cause him problems. Unfortunately, this is the only way he'll ever stop. So before you do anything against him, make preparations for your own safety.\n\nI'm sorry to scare you but I've heard multiple cases like yours and the creep's behavior always escalates no matter what you do. I have never once heard of a victim saying \"He just left me alone and nothing else happened\". **You have a stalker.** It is important that you understand that and not treat him as a harmless person who just needs to be told nicely that what he's doing is not ok.\n\nI strongly suggest looking online for resources that can help you against stalkers. There are probably organizations or support groups out there that specialize in these situations.\n\nYou may also want to speak to a lawyer who specializes in stalking and harassment cases, because on top of helping you get a restraining order against this man, they might be able to point you to resources and people who can help.\n\nPlease take this seriously. I know it can be hard to accept that this man could be dangerous or that you must be hard on him, but this is the reality of your situation.", "NTA.
