Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy (we'll call him Ronald, mid 40'sM) bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\n\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\n\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\n\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\n\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\n\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\n\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone. But I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that knocking on a woman's door late at night when she's not expecting you is a bad thing, and after three times, I can't just ignore this anymore.\n\nSo, wibta if I reported him?", "created_utc": 1686760003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c878/wibta_if_i_reported_the_delivery_driver_who_keeps/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Delivery services aren't supposed to mark and check up on addresses they get while on the job. He got her address while on the clock and so any harassment of OP does need to be told to his employer because OP might not be the only prior delivery address he's doing this to. And also on the basis that people like this shouldn't have unfettered access to addresses, names, and phone numbers like this. If it's one of the big 3 (door dash, uber eats, postmates) they even have policies stating that drivers doing this will be fired. It's privacy policy.", "Absolutely reason to alert his job. She might not be the only one he's stalking.", "NTA\n\nOP, this is very serious so please read this.\n\nFirst of all: A delivery person (or anyone really) should never show up at a customer's place for reasons outside of their job. That's highly inappropriate, a breach of privacy and boundaries, unprofessional and creepy. You would have been right to report him the first time he showed up. This is the kind of situation where he 100% knows better and you'd be completely right to report him to his employer and to the police (they can't do much for the first time he shows up, but you at least want them to start a paper trail).\n\nWith that out of the way, here is what you must understand: **you are in a dangerous situation**. This man is a creep and a stalker. He's not doing what he does because he is dumb or clueless, he's doing it because he has an unhealthy fixation on you and no concern for boundaries. Since he is already showing up at your home repeatedly, there's a strong risk he'll escalate. **He could end up assaulting you**. \n\n**You need to take your safety very seriously at this moment**. You must report him or it will only get worse, but you also need to be prepared for his reaction once you do. Because of course, he won't like it when you cause him problems. Unfortunately, this is the only way he'll ever stop. So before you do anything against him, make preparations for your own safety.\n\nI'm sorry to scare you but I've heard multiple cases like yours and the creep's behavior always escalates no matter what you do. I have never once heard of a victim saying \"He just left me alone and nothing else happened\". **You have a stalker.** It is important that you understand that and not treat him as a harmless person who just needs to be told nicely that what he's doing is not ok.\n\nI strongly suggest looking online for resources that can help you against stalkers. There are probably organizations or support groups out there that specialize in these situations.\n\nYou may also want to speak to a lawyer who specializes in stalking and harassment cases, because on top of helping you get a restraining order against this man, they might be able to point you to resources and people who can help.\n\nPlease take this seriously. I know it can be hard to accept that this man could be dangerous or that you must be hard on him, but this is the reality of your situation.", "NTA.

Some of those men are weird and take it as something more than that. \n\nMy wife is a bartender and has this happens all the time. It\u2019s her job to be nice to her patrons. Some of these men are lonely and take that kindness as some sort of connection. Countless times I\u2019ve had to come out at 2 am to see her to her car and to follow her home due to some dude professing his love for her, buying her flowers or some other weird shit.  I\u2019ve had to have conversations with a few.  Look dude, it\u2019s her job to smile at you and serve you beers. She\u2019s not in love with you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this.  Please be careful and pay attention when coming and going from your home.\n\nAnd you should 1000% report it", "Showing up at your door in the middle of the night is doing something.", "NTA! Report him and file a police report. If he turns up again call the police immediately.

Also, put up no trespassing signs.", "Report this person ASAP. \n\nThese are very classic red flags for a stalker and he is going to hurt you.\n\nYWNBTA", "Call the police", "No, this was really scary to read. This guy sounds dangerous. Please report him and take measures to stay safe since he knows where you live and will show up any time of day or night.", "NTA\n\nBut, more importantly, don't let yourself become a statistic. Buy some self-defense measures, such as a taser or pepper spray, and inform the authorities.", "[removed]", "NTA!!! Report him before he kicks down your door! Don\u2019t feel bad for doing something about a creepy drunken delivery man! Give a shit about yourself!! \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. Call the police today. File a report today. Call the restaurant today. \n\nDo not downplay the fact that he THINKS it's ok to show up when he's wasted or high. He has crossed many boundaries and social norms. He's escalating. You thinking he's not dangerous is wrong. There is something clearly not right in his head. Don't become a news story, please. Report him.", "NTA but you should call the police not his workplace. He's just stalking you, not actually performing any duties related to his job and presumably off the clock.", "NTA\n\nReport him to the police and the restaurant, this is NOT okay.", "NTA. You should absolutely report him. He shouldn't have a job where he's sent to people's houses if he's going to do things like that. Maybe he hasn't done anything yet but that doesn't mean he wouldn't. Call the cops and the restaurant.", "If you don\u2019t want to call the emergency number you can call the nonemergency number.

Tell the police too!", "PLEASE report him. I understand your worries about costing him his job, but his actions are unacceptable and threatening. this could go south very quickly and you are actively in danger. get a ring camera asap, let people close to you know the situation and also call the police. I doubt they will be much help in the moment, but that will leave a legal paper trail that will help you get a restraining order if need be", "My partner and I had something similar happen but with a street beggar my partner has been nice too. One night he came round shouting and banging and stayed over an hour. Not worried about personal safety as doors locked but was worried my partner would get stabbed if went out.\n\nSo called non-emergency police number for advice. They put me through immediately to 999 dispatch and police were there in 5mins. This was 8pm at night.  They deemed it an emergency and put my house on patrol for a few weeks. In UK, so police unarmed so no shooting risk.\n\nI share story because that was how seriously enforcement took something I initially though was unpleasant but not dangerous. They disagreed as escalating. A fixation on you for any reason is dangerous.", "File a police report & get a no contact order TODAY", ">He's never actually done anything.\n\nYea he has.  He's been harassing you.", "You don't want to make things HARD FOR HIM?!?? \nWTAF?!?? \nHe is STALKING YOU. \nYou need to file a police report yesterday and contact his place of employment as well. \nGet bear spray, a ring doorbell, and a big dog.\n\nNTA. \n\nHow did you ever learn that making sure creepy men are comfortable is worth more than your safety and well-being??", "Nta please report him and stay safe.

You dont know him or when it can escalate", "Please report this to the police. There\u2019s no guarantee that they\u2019ll do anything, but at least there\u2019s a record of it. I had/have a stalker. The police were very well aware of him and he\u2019s been reported by multiple women, but the police \u201cdeclined\u201d to pursue it. Ended up having to get an attorney that wrote an ass burner of a cease and desist letter. Someone mentioned that women are trained to be more concerned with the comfort of others over themselves. I agree with that statement. This \u201cconcern\u201d often makes us disregard our inside voice that sounds the alarm bells of potential danger. Do not disregard that inner voice.  Be safe. And you are so NTA.", "NTA \n\nMuffintrucking societal norms of politeness over safety have convinced us that calling out frightening and illegal behavior is rude and might be a bad call.", "Get yourself a doorbell cam if you dont already have one, will be very clear evidence if he keeps showing up.\n\nAlso not to scare you but, every bad person in the world did nothing before they did something. So dont think that just because he hasnt become violent that hes not dangerous.\n\nHe may not be, but dont take your chances, you did well shutting him down, maybe he was genuinely naive and thought he was being friendly... but i think its more likely hes a creep.\n\nIn terms of reporting him. Im not going to tell you what to do because i dont know what id do\n\nEither way youre NTA for whatever decision you make", "NTA - Keep a log of dates, times, what he did/said, where he works and report him to the police!\n\nThis is harassment and needs to be delt with.", "Oh, honey!

Please report him to both his work and the police. You may not be the only one.", "NTA. I do not want to hear this story on a crime show. You should be concerned!
