{"id": 19673, "submission_id": "149c878", "title": "WIBTA if I reported the delivery driver who keeps showing up at my door in the middle of the night?", "selftext": "Around the end of last year one of the local fast food places started doing deliveries and I (38F), took advantage of the convenience. Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy (we'll call him Ronald, mid 40'sM) bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\n\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\n\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\n\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\n\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\n\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\n\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone. But I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that knocking on a woman's door late at night when she's not expecting you is a bad thing, and after three times, I can't just ignore this anymore.\n\nSo, wibta if I reported him?", "created_utc": 1686760003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c878/wibta_if_i_reported_the_delivery_driver_who_keeps/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
