She was confused and came back to me and asked why I didn\u2019t come with her. I told her because it\u2019s a women\u2019s underwear store I don\u2019t want to go inside. She got kind of mad and told me that nobody cares so just come. I refused because I feel weird going into a store like that and don\u2019t want to make the women there feel uncomfortable.

She may have wanted you there because she wanted to pick out lingerie that you would like, which could be why she was so  upset that you wouldn't go in with her.", "NAH - Dude, she's not mad at you for not going into the store. She's mad at you for not going into the store *with her*.\n\nShe wanted to do something fun, flirty and a bit naughty with you. And you goofed.\n\nEdit:\nI think a lot of people are misconstruing what I meant by \"goofed\".\nI don't think he should have gone in if he was uncomfortable. Consent comes in many forms.\n\nWhat I meant was: If he'd taken what *I think* was the hint she was dropping (we all know men are bad at taking hints  especially 20yo men) then he might have asked why she wanted him to go in there so badly. And that could have led to a compromise (like going home and buying something on the VS website).\n\nThe reason I said he \"goofed\" was because it was a light-hearted admonishment for being too silly to realise what his partner wanted.", "You're NTA for not going in if you didn't want to, but you whiffed this one hoss.\n\nShe wanted to see what you liked. She probably wanted to pick something to appeal to you. No women in the store care when they see a man with his lady or a man by themselves. Plenty shop there for gifts for SOs (or themselves! Pretty underthings are for anyone who wants to wear them).\n\nDont let your hangups cockblock you my friend.", "NAH - it's not a crime to be socially awkward, and it's not a crime for her to get frustrated when you can't get over it so you two can have fun.\n\nIt wasn't the women in the shop that would have been uncomfortable, it's you.  So while I'm not going to say either of you is the AH here, it feels likely that you two aren't going to work out if you're so clearly not on the same page.\n\nGood luck", "NTA\u2026.but kinda dumb. You have very young relationship vibes. You are nta for me because you are entitled to not go into a store if you don\u2019t want to and she way overreacted. \n\nIdk about your area, but at the Victoria Secret in my mall the population is about 50/50 shopping there, as in half men, half women. Women who would be extremely uncomfortable about a man being there (not a reasonable expectation fyi) shop online, not in a mall. \n\nSo if you are at the point in your relationship where you see your girlfriend\u2019s underwear\u2026it\u2019s pretty clear to me she wanted you to come help her pick out undergarments you would enjoy seeing on her. Definitely missed a big sign here. She went around it the wrong way, but I think she is feeling a bit rejected. She might have thought it would be fun and sexy for you to help her select something. You both definitely need to talk it out. Good luck!", "INFO: Is your relationship with your gf the type in which you might see her in her underwear?", "You do know she might have been shopping for your benefit, don't you? Maybe wanted your input?\\\n\\\nNAH, nevertheless.", "Lol. NTA, but this is just silly. A man tagging along with his SO isn\u2019t going to make any women in there feel uncomfortable. You should\u2019ve instead told your gf that *you\u2019re* uncomfortable (actual truth) and not blamed all the other unsuspecting customers. It\u2019s just undies, go in the store next time.\n\n\nEdit: if you are truly that uncomfortable, your gf should be more understanding. She\u2019s pretty immature for letting it \u201cruin\u201d the day. She could try being a little less self centered and more understanding. That is, when you actually tell her how *you* feel, instead of putting it on others.", "INFO: why did you feel uncomfortable going in?", "I dont think anyone particularly sucks here  \n\n\nyour girlfriend wanted to see what lingerie you liked (you refusing to go in thwarted her plans)  \n\n\nyou didnt want to go in (which is fine, although maybe you should have been clear about that.)  \n\n\nthe only thing I would say is that your assumption that people will think your a creep is unfounded, if you were going in by yourself to perve that would be one thing, going in with your partner and looking at what she is interested is different, keep your eyes on your girl and everything is fine.\n\nEdit apparently I am supposed to add NAH because people are unable to read a post without a 3 letter snap judgement", "NTA. But honestly, it\u2019s kinda silly. Men often go into lingerie stores, with or without their partners and no one bats an eyelid. Done it by myself often. How are you going to act if, heaven forbid, your GF asks you to pick up some tampons for her? Freak out then too. You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing but I went with NTA because you just need to work through your awkwardness and grow up a little.", "Oh my gosh, thank you for giving me a laugh this morning! \ud83d\ude02\n\nNAH\n\nAs long as you don't touch the models and have female guide, you won't be silently cursed.", "Looks like you totally missed her hint at wanting to get your input on some lingerie etc. So NTA but you fumbled the sexy time bag.", "NTA. People on here need to relax. I don\u2019t want to go into these stores either because it doesn\u2019t appeal to me.

You\u2019re not going to make other women uncomfortable in a store. It\u2019s a store. Behave as you would in any other store. \n\n2. She wanted you to come in a get your opinion on what she would buy or look good in. Since you\u2019re the person who would be seeing her wearing it.\n\nYou really shot yourself in the foot. Your GF asked you to come help her pick out underwear. NTA for not wanting to go in, but you\u2019ve got to understand she was asking for validation from you and probably wanted to flirt. Considering you are currently the only person she would parade around in her underwear for, she wanted you to be interested in that. \n\nNot going in does not you an AH. But your future self might not agree.\n\nEdit: in future, if you don\u2019t want to go in express that it makes you uncomfortable but you\u2019d still like to see what she\u2019s interested in so she can send you pics of whatever it is she\u2019s looking at. You stay out of the store you don\u2019t want to go into, while still showing interest in your girlfriend and what she might be looking to share with you. But seriously. If you can go to a store and not behave like a creep then there\u2019s no reason to be uncomfortable.", "NAH per se but since you\u2019re young I\u2019m gunna give you a little advice picking out sexy clothes for your partner isn\u2019t just a female thing. Maybe she wanted your input on something that would make you happy.", "Let me give you some advice. One day you might want to buy this girl some nice lingerie or underwear. Go inside. Pay attention. Be a grown adult.", "NTA. After being told I can't go near a changing area my wife was using in a non-underwear store, I can absolutely understand as a man not wanting to make women uncomfortable by walking to a Victoria's Secret store. Given you can totally just wait outside without hurting anyone I don't see why this would make you TA.", "NTA, but man. You missed out.", "NAH. You\u2019re both very young, it\u2019s not that big of a deal in the long run. Maybe she wanted your opinion on something, it would have been nice to go with her if she wanted you with her. But at the end of the day if you don\u2019t feel comfortable going in, then she can\u2019t force you.\n\nTry not to worry too much about it. Communicate with your girlfriend clearly exactly how you feel and maybe try a little harder to go into the store with her next time if she wants your opinion on something.", "NTA, but you should have gone in: You certainly could have found a pair of big-girl panties to put on.", "NTA I love shopping fancy underwear but I would also respect my boyfriend's comfort zone and he'd done the exact same thing.", "In case you didn't know, she was wanting your help picking something to wear on your next trip to pound town. Your refusal made her feel rejected and embarrassed which is why she lashed out.\n\nHowever you are NTA for your side of this. \n\nHow about ask her with compassion if she felt bad that you blew off what she thought was a sexual activity/foreplay type situation? Then discuss it without either of you dismissing how the other feels.", "NTA, \n\nThis is something that gets better with time, the women in there aren\u2019t uncomfortable unless your staring at them or making them uncomfortable. If you\u2019re just browsing with your partner no one cares.\n\nI remember being incredibly uncomfortable underwear shopping with girlfriends around that age but 20 years later if my wife wants to go underwear shopping with my I\u2019m all in. I get to make suggestions, sometimes requests and sometimes I even get surprises that she buys without telling me so it\u2019s become a fun thing. \n\nIf she\u2019s doing something mind-numbingly boring like getting a salon treatment or her nails done I\u2019ll tell her to text me when she\u2019s done and I\u2019ll go hang out in the local hobby shop as she doesn\u2019t like heading in there as she finds it boring.", "NTA\n\nIt's funny how everyone here preaches about boundaries but then suddenly this guy is an AH for enforcing his own.\n\nHis gf doesn't need him there. Pushing him to come and getting angry shows how immature she is", "NTA. I get why you didn\u2019t feel comfortable and you communicated your feelings when she asked.\n\nAnd your GF handled it wrong. If she was trying to be flirty, then she could have communicated better vs throwing a tempter tantrum.", "NTA, there's really nothing wrong with you going into the shop, but if you don't want to for whatever reason then your gf should try to understand and certainly shouldn't get upset with you. Maybe she just wanted you to help her pick cute underwear or something and got upset because of that.", "ESH it\u2019s lame you\u2019re weird about going into a store and it\u2019s uncool of her to not respect that you\u2019re weird.", "YTA\n\nI don't think most women are going to have any issue with you being in there when you are with your girlfriend. And if you were going around with a store employee because you're wanting some help navigating women's lingerie to get her a gift, they'd understand that too. And the fact that she wanted you to go in says that she wanted your input for something that you'd like seeing her in during bedroom fun time. I can understand her being upset because a lot of men refuse to go into those stores simply because \"that's for girls and I'm a guy and I won't be caught dead in there.\" Maybe put on your big boy shorts, apologize, and suggest going back, yeah?", "LOL. YTA. and childish. You can't be serious!", "Esh you can learn some things about her while shes browses like her tastes or hints on what to get her\n\nYoure both ridiculously stubborn over a trip to store", "YTA, man up and, most importantly, grow up. It's clothing. She might want your opinion on some pieces. And for other women in there, if they see a young man genuinly helping his GF to make some choices, why would they feel uncomfortable. Just don't stare at them, focus on your GF.\n\nI am with my wife when she goes shopping for underwear, i ask what exactly she wants and then i look around if i can find something suitable for her. Keeping in mind that \"looking sexy\" isn't the only factor but also comfort. Not all underwear is for sexy time, most is for everyday use.\n\nSo again, grow up, man up. It's just clothing.", "NTA.\n\nIf you don't want to go into you shouldn't have too. And you're right, a lot of women probably don't feel comfortable having strange men walking around the store while they look at underwear.\n\nThe fact the your GF then overreacts by saying you ruined the day is a massive red flag. I know you're only 20 but it seems like a very immature reaction and not very respectful of your boundaries.", "Nta, just an idiot tbh. As every other comment says,  she probably wanted help in picking out lingerie for you....", "She overreacted but you can definitely go in to Victoria's secret lol.", "well we know now the op wont go in there to birthday or christmas shop for his gf lol", "Mild TYA. Like, \"if salt was a spice\" mild.\n\nThe AH bit, is only because it sounds like you should have communicated that you weren't going to go in before she went in. The rest is No-Ass, but I do want to address not wanting to go in.\n\nI mean, not wanting to go in is fine, but I honestly think you should work on that.\n\nYou give the reason that other customers might think it's creepy; it's really not in VS. \n\nAnyway, here's a guide on how not to be a creep in a lingerie store: you go in with your girlfriend, you look at what she looks at, and you don't look at/hit on other women in the store. Just stick by her, and keep her company while she shops.\n\nAlso, I really want to point out that she *might* have wanted a little sexy conversation in there. Like, talking what sort of things you might like to see her wear in bed, then sending you outside the store before making her purchases, so there'd still be an element of surprise when she models them later. (That's just one scenario) \n\nBut ALL of that requires you having enough confidence to be in a lingerie store with your girlfriend. Not having that confidence doesn't make you an AH, but I'd really suggest you work on it, because it might make for more fun times shopping with your gf.\n\nEdit: I also want to mention that VS is both an underwear store, and an lingerie store. The underwear only stuff (aka underwear that only she will see) tends to be in a very separate section from lingerie (stuff that's designed to be *seen* - it's the \"sexy\" underwear that you wear for your partner). It's an important distinction, and the vibe in each area is different. You'll see more men in lingerie sections than where you get your standard 5-pack of panties.", "NTA leaning towads n a h \n\nNta purely because she says you ruined the day,, its clear that you were uncomfortable and you also didn't want anyone else to be. It just sounds like you two should discuss boundaries and what your comfortable with, I'd your girlfriend blowing past your comforts when out is well into AH territory.", "NTA. If a guy doesn't want to go in a store that sells mostly womens underwear thats totally fine. If she realy wanted you to pick something out for her, she should have toled you. I personally prefer picking out what I like and my SO gets what they get.", "NAH. However My ex always refused to go into lingerie or sex toy stores or give feedback on styles which was really frustrating. Whereas my partner now its a fun sexy trip picking this together and trying on and I know he likes whats ive chosen and have a better idea or styles or toys that could be fun. Your girlfriend just wanted that, a fun time and to find items you find sexy on her- so your refusal is a disapointment abd a downer. its partially for your own benefit to go in!\n\nAlso no one is gonna be uncomfortable, it's not like your walking in on women wearing them.", "Congratulations NAH but you cock blocked yourself there mate. Next time she's like let's go into the shop that sells sexy underwear you put ya big boy pants on and get in there as she's looking for you not her", "I mean she probably overreacted by ending the day early but it seems kind of juvenile to me to refuse to go into a victoria's secret because you're a man. i'm a lesbian so this isn't a problem i've encountered with partners, maybe it's just hard for me to understand. either way NAH.", "If you genuinely don't feel comfortable going in there then she shouldn't really have pressured you, but it's a shame you feel that way because I really don't think you need to.\n\nIt's not \"weird\" for men to be in stores like that, and it isn't going to make women feel uncomfortable unless you're trying to follow them into the changing rooms! And I bet one of the most common thing the staff deal with is men who are looking to buy gifts and need help because \"excuse me, how do bra sizes work?\"\n\nAlso, it seems pretty obvious that she thought it would be fun/cute/exciting for you to pick something out together that _you'd then get to see her in_. She wants to know what _you'd_ like because... I'm sure I don't need to explain. Did you consider that not wanting to do that with her might make her feel rejected in some way?\n\nIt's easy to say she overreacted, but I think you have to consider that her reaction isn't about just not wanting to go in a shop with her. Obviously it's not really what happened but what she may well have been feeling was that she said \"let's do something a bit sexy together\" and your reaction was \"absolutely not - I don't want to do sexy things with you and I'm disgusted that you think I would.\" That's hyperbole, but you get what I mean.\n\nI'm going with NAH, but I think there's a bit of growing up to be done and ideally a bit better communication between the two of you. It's mainly just a shame that you both came away from the situation feeling bad when it could have been something really fun that brought you a lot closer.", "NAH but no one cares if you\u2019re there. No one. Not a single person. Women\u2019s underwear is just clothing. There\u2019s no reason to be so weird about bras, you\u2019re an adult. You don\u2019t have to go in if you don\u2019t want to but it\u2019s just a piece of fabric it\u2019s not gonna bite you", "NTA", "YTA, and am missing out on some fun stuff! WHY would you not want to..", "YTA\nBRUH. she probably wanted to model some shit for you. Way to ensure she never wears lingerie for you.\n \n>For those of you who don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a women\u2019s underwear store.\n\n It's fabric on mannequins. You feel weird about seeing fabric on mannequins... Why? It makes zero sense.", "NAH. It is okay that you felt uncomfortable, but this plotline sounds straight out of an anime.\n\nMaybe she wanted to go inside with you to ask you which kind of underwear you like. So you just missed out a great opportunity in my opinion", "I will say this. No one does care. But if you do that\u2019s enough. How you could turn the day by not going into Victoria Secrets is beyond me. I go with NTA.", "NTA. Regardless of the store, you said you didn't want to go in, obviously didn't stop her from going in and found a place to situate yourself so she could shop. Does she have some kind of disability that she needs you around to help her? If not, then her reaction is over the top and uncalled for. To say you ruined the day because you didn't want to go into one store is ridiculous.", "NTA, but you both are immature and you're using woman's discomfort as a cover for your own.", "NTA. Victoria's Secret is a sketchy exploitative company owned by a friend of Jeffrey Epstine and designed to make women and girls feel bad about themselves to buy more crappy ill fitting lingerie", "NTA \nWhat does she men, nobody cares? You care! You are not a nobody. \nSecondly, you didn\u2019t ruin anything by not going into the store. She just made an issue out of a non issue. Couples often shop together and then one stays outside if tired or not interested in the specific shop.", "NTA, your reason makes sense (though men there with their spouses is not unusual). I expect you may have missed some signals in what her expectations were here. It's possible she wanted this part of shopping to be a gateway to some sort of intimacy, and her anger stems from it not going as expected.\n\nJust talk it out and you'll be fine.", "ESH \n\nYou both need to grow up.", "Borderline NTA because you are being considerate of how other female shoppers may feel.\n\nHowever, maybe you are reading too much into how people feel generally , and you failed to read into the specific situation in front of you.", "Omg. Grow up. It\u2019s just underwear. \ud83d\ude44\n\nESH.", "ESH.  \n\n\nUnderwear is nothing magical it's just cloth you wear on your private parts. You should grow up. What will you do when your gf asks you to buy pads for her during that time of the month if you are scared to go into the store with underwear.  \n\n\nAlso if your gf's day is ruined by you not going to the store then oh boy what a fragile being she is.  \n\n\nYou both need to grow up.", "\"don\u2019t want to make the women there feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nThat's a very good and considerate reason for not going in. I don't understand why your gf reacted the she did. NTA.", "ESH, nobody will care if you go. You won't be the first guy that goes there to 1) accompany your partner 2) Get a gift for your partner or 3) I'm sure this also happened but get stuff for yourself. But also her saying that it ruined the day for you to not go is overreaction too.", "NTA, I always think it\u2019s hilarious when there\u2019s a woman in VS towing a clearly uncomfortable guy around, double if he\u2019s carrying a bunch of shopping bags and she\u2019s carrying 0. \n\nDid she need your opinion for something? Was she trying things on for you? Doubtful and it\u2019s not like they would have let you in the room with her. \n\nShe sounds bossy and controlling.", "ESH but lightly. You're both still acting like children.\n\n It's a store, I go in with my girlfriend, and my girl friends, and never have I ever gotten so much as a second glance. So relax.\n\nAs for your girlfriend, she has to know your comfort is as important as hers and getting mad at you isn't the way to have a discussion or relationship.", "NTA, because I see your point and your gf totally went overboard with her reaction.", "NTA. My 60+ husband, years ago, went to a mall with a Christmas list(he liked shopping, me, not so much). One of the things on the list was a gift card from Victoria's Secret for our adult daughter.

You definitely are not the only male who refuses to step foot in that store. Your girlfriend was acting childish for not respecting your choice.", "Not at all.

Don't feel you have to be there - you could just be respectful of those who want to choose their knickers in peace :)  \n\n\nBTW your GF is an idiot in this situation - not respecting your choice, not respecting others shopping, then having a toddler tantrum. Have you considered dating a grown-up?", "You are obviously young and it sounds like you may be pretty sheltered in life. NAH and it's not wrong that you stayed within your comfort zone.

Don't need a reason.", "NTA she is for ending the whole day out because you didn't want to go into one clothing store, you didn't stop her, you didn't judge her, you just hanged back because you didn't feel comfortable going into a store that souly sells womens underwear and maybe sleep wear/sex toys.\n\nShe could have gone in with the hopes of you helping her pick out sexy lingerie you both may enjoy, but she didn't communicate any of that, just ended the outing.", "You both sound like complete snowflakes\u2026", "ESH", "NTA, but your gf is. Men get unpleasant looks, scowls, etc in places like Victoria's Secret. There are things society prefers men not to do, and going into women's underwear stores are one of them. Some people will do or say bizarre things to men in such places, such as calling police. It does not happen often, but it does happen. If your girlfriend does not understand that and why you would prefer to avoid that risk, you should find a different partner. Your partner should support and protect you, not berate you for a reasonable concern and a reasonable course of action", "NTA for not wanting the other women to feel uncomfortable, but I wouldn't really care if your partner had brought you there for feedback, which is *very* easy to surmise from the scenario.

She got kind of mad and told me that nobody cares so just come. I refused because I feel weird going into a store like that and don\u2019t want to make the women there feel uncomfortable.

With that said though, you did massively misunderstand what she really wanted. Let me tell you a secret my guy, women don't take guys to Victoria's Secret for no reason. They do it because they want you to tell them they're beautiful. She wanted you come in, help her pick out something you thought was sexy, then tell her how beautiful she is, how amazingly sexy she is, and how much she means to you. She wanted to hear you say it (even if you've said it before, she wanted you to say it again) and you refused, so now she's gonna be questioning herself, wondering if she actually is beautiful. Go talk to her man, tell her you're an ass, that you didn't realize it was so important, and most of all, tell her you're sorry. \n\nI also understand why you're uncomfortable, you're a man this is a women's clothing store specializing in undergarments. But plenty of guys go there either with their girlfriends, or to buy something they'd seen their gfs/wives looking at in the catalog as a gift.

I have actually had some pretty gross experiences in VS, where men I don\u2019t know try to talk to me or ask me whether I like something in a creepy and invasive way.  I do think you need to be extra sensitive in a store like that and ideally not approach or talk to women you don\u2019t know. However, if you mind your own business and are not being a creep, there is no issue with you joining your partner in VS.  It also may be good for you - it is positive and beneficial to communicate about sex and sex adjacent things with your partner without shame and embarrassment, and to the extent you are feeling any of that, communication and new experiences will be helpful to you and your relationship.", "Hahaha oh dude everyone judges you for not going into the store with her.", "Any chance you were raised conservative?", "It\u2019s just a shop.

So my brother drove me to the mall, I went to Victoria's Secret only to find that he promptly ditched me.\n\nSo there I was, never before in VS, trying to pick something out. I had my partner's measurements, but not her size. So when the incredibly gorgeous attendant walked up to me, could tell I was probably too young, she seemed to have fun making me embarrassed. She asked if she could help, I told her what I was doing. She asked size, I gave her numbers. \n\nThis freakin' woman held up the lingerie i was looking up in front of her and asked if she was my girlfriend's size. I died. I went flush. I stammered. I ended up spending double my budget. I don't think I spoke much the rest of the time in there, I just stammered and muttered and nodded. I must have been beat red. She had this damned smug smirk the rest of the transaction. We enjoyed the lingerie later (my partner, not the attendant) but she enjoyed the story far more. Ever since that harrowing experience, I struggle to be comfortable inside a VS.\n\nGo in, OP. Don't look at the other women, don't check them out.

I told them why I was there and that there was another employee getting the items. I was then informed that I had apparently \u201cmade other shoppers uncomfortable.\u201d The store was fairly busy and there were a decent amount of women in there but all I had done was walk in, talk the the lady at the register, and then stood there waiting. I was asked to leave right as the woman was coming back with the set and thankfully the situation was resolved once they saw that I was actually there for why I said I was.

It\u2019s similar to grabbing a box out a woman\u2019s hand \u201cbecause I\u2019m stronger because I\u2019m a man so I\u2019ll carry it for her even though she didn\u2019t ask for help.\u201d", "he's just making that up though. why would him going to a store make someone uncomfortable?", "There's this thing called the internet and media that's heavily influenced by North American culture...", "According to their website they have over 1300+ stores in 70+ countries.", "And it's just VC.   It's overpriced shitty lingerie at that.  It's not what it was 20, 30, or 40 years ago where the idea was more risque.  VC is basically a step above Kohls and Walmart undergarments today.    \n     \nOP has some old skool ideas about VC that just hasn't existed since before the malls died.", "They also have men providing customer service on the floor in those stores.  Pulling bra sizes for you, suggesting panties to match.", "People def don't bat an eye at a man in a VS anymore. But it could also simply be that she finds tasks easier to do with a body-double. Aka OP in this situation. So even if she wasn't trying to be suggestive, it's possible she did have an ulterior motive... maybe just \"I don't feel like going alone.\"\n\nThat said, OP is NTA. My fiance also doesn't like going in there and I let him choose if he wants to join or not. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. It's definitely okay to have boundaries. If your gf is struggling with anxiety or something that makes shopping alone uncomfortable for her, she may want to consider leaving this store for a girls' outting.", "Then she should have told him thats what she wanted. Men cant read minds.", "If she ends the day over it and is that upset tho? That's a deal breaker for me, it sounds like a tantrum to me", "Thank you... Some of these comments seem like anything short of getting hit in the face with a shovel is \"subtle\".", "If he's uncomfortable I don't see why he should force himself.", "That's a very shaky limb since we have literally no information that points to that.", "I've gone into a Victoria's Secret plenty of times. I have never been the only guy in there. I even saw a bewildered man once trying to make sense of what the sales lady was telling him as he was obviously buying presents for his significant other and was having a tough time with sizing.\n\nI agree he's not an asshole, but there is definitely some immaturity and insecurity here.", "Right? My beef here would be my partner\u2019s squeamishness around \u201clady things\u201d. Understandable at 20 I suppose but hopefully he grows out of it.", "He's still a kid, he's allowed to be immature. You're not an adult at 20 even if the world says you are. I'm a woman and wouldn't have gone in there either at his age. I would have been crazy uncomfortable and probably would have frozen up. I definitely wasn't mature enough for that store back then. Don't give a damn now I'm older.", "Exactly idk what these other people are blaming the guy, she didnt communicate at all thats what she wanted.", "I agree", "Absolutely. As a previously awkward 20 year old guy, I know lots of other guys that would feel uncomfortable  going into a women\u2019s underwear store at that age. Totally depends on upbringing", "Finally, someone with some common fucking sense.", "I never said they didn't...but that the OP here is NOT in the wrong for thinking that some women may be uncomfortable and prefer otherwise, he's not wrong.\n\nNobody ever said make them feel like transgressors, however women are allowed to feel uncomfortable, and men (like OP) is allowed to feel uncomfortable for himself as well as his perception that it may be uncomfortable to others, and act/choose accordingly.", "even if he's assuming that, that doesn't make him as asshole. sure, it may be na\u00efve but it comes from a good place.", "you can't be that dense. you have to know that buying underwear isn't the same thing as buying groceries. one is obviously more private. most women probably aren't going to mind a man in the store but it's not a crazy leap to think that some women might be uncomfortable", "You might be comfortable but the fact of the matter is other women might not be. Many men have been stared at while shopping in the women's section, myself included.", "Most of those stores are in the US.  They don\u2019t have a huge international presence (70 countries is like 1/3rd of those in the world), for example, France and Germany combined only have 12 stores.  India has a whopping 2 stores.  Some countries, like UK and China have quite a few stores, but not many.    \n   \nFor comparison, there are 10 stores in the Denver metro area alone.", "Victoria\u2019s Secret was actually developed by men as a lingerie store where they would be comfortable shopping. Women shoppers came into the equation later.", ">It\u2019s also a boutique store.\n\nIt's the largest lingerie section in Ireland I understand", "As a woman, can confirm the only time I would be uncomfortable by a man\u2019s presence in the lingerie store is if he was disregarding basic boundaries like ogling at us or making weird/creepy comments.\n\nMen just being there shopping isn\u2019t anything to even notice.", "I just bought 2 cotton sleep shirts from them because they\u2019re one of the few stores selling them this year and not in ugly colors", "Refusing to go in is being weird. Obviously the real question is whether OP is willing to buy tampons and pads; is he actually just being weird about this store, or is he making up excuses because he's afraid of cooties?", "\ud83d\ude02", "They're just kids (being 18 doesnt make you an adult). She was more then likely embarrassed to spell it out or thought she was being obvious. It's a learning experience for both of them. She'll learn to say what's on her mind as she gets older and grows more confident and he'll learn to ask directly why she wants to go in somewhere like that with him/might be able to take hints better. \n\nMen can be awful at hints, my boyfriend is one of them. It can be frustrating when it's so damn obvious and he doesn't notice, think neon flashing lights of a hint! Got to give them a poke and say, hey this is what's happening, you in?", "Yep. As a guy that occasionally goes in a women\u2019s specific store, looking for myself, the best thing to do is don\u2019t act like you are a guy in a women specific store. You are just another customer interested in a product. Browse, find what you are interested in, ask a question if you are brave enough to, and buy what you want. It\u2019s really only an issue if you are obviously trying not to be seen which can come off as being a bit of a creeper. If going in with your spouse/significant other? Definitely won\u2019t even be looked at. Everyone will assume you are only there to be with your spouse/significant other. \n\nAlso, every guy should try some women\u2019s clothing at least once. You can\u2019t get that level soft in things like underwear without special ordering from someplace and paying even more to get the \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d version.", "He FID communicate and what, you think it\u2019s weird so he\u2019s an asshole for being uncomfortable? What about a fear of heights? Is that stupid or acceptable? What about discomfort around pets or kids? That\u2019s not valid either?", "It's not weird, I keep feeling that the guy's boundaries/discomfort keeps getting invalidated here, simply because he's male and young.  \n\nLet's reverse this, if a woman was uncomfortable with her bf wanting to go into a lingerie store with her, is she 'weird and unresonable' because in this millennium men/women shop at lingerie stores all the time together?\n\nBoundaries, and respect for feelings apply to BOTH men/women.", "How did he do a crap job of communicating? It should be pretty obvious he wasn't comfortable or didn't want to go in when he waited outside, the fuck", "Mostly incorrect. While the burden of communication is somewhat shared in a relationship (i.e. you should seek out what the other person wants, to some degree), communication is ultimately the responsibility of the communicator, not the receiver. If you want something, say it. It's not his job to figure it out.", "But he communicated, she didn't.", "I agree. It's more mature to have a boundary about going somewhere and state it clearly and kindly than it is like to ignore your boundaries and be uncomfortable in an experience that should have been fun. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf his girlfriend bounces back and apologizes/explains, she wanted to do it together shopping online for these things is a great compromise", "\"You didn't do everything your woman says, regardless of your comfort with said order? But you were going to possibly get the gift of her genitals later!!!!\"", "Ah, the original confused boner movie.", "Is Victoria secret not the biggest brand in lingerie in the world? I understand not everyone is American but you're acting like he's explaining what Victoria secret is to three guys in Papua new guinea. Don't speak on behalf of the world. Did you know what this guy meant when he said Victoria secret or not. End of discussion.", "Coincidence- VS and B&BW are the same company.", "And then there\u2019s my dad who believes that Bath and Body works is the same thing as Bed, Bath, and Beyond. He ran an errand for my mom at the wrong store and argued with the cashiers because they wouldn\u2019t let him use a BBB gift card at B&BW.  He insisted they were the same place.", "They're under the same umbrella company. I used to work at BBW", "Ooh I love their sports section in the one near me", "It's not ridiculous to him, we should respect a male's no as much as a woman's, and not call them ridiculous, unreasonable, projecting, etc.\n\nRespect of boundaries goes both ways.", "100% agreed. It's insane how many people call OP the asshole when she clearly got upset over him having boundaries and then she threw a fit. She's a fuckin adult, quit giving little hints at what you want and communicate.\n\nThis is actually nuts.", "I agree. My partner is 37 years old and he will not come in any lingerie/sex shop. Her response was inappropriate. The first time I went into a shop like this while physically with him, he stood outside and I just said \"are you coming? I might need your help?\" and he immediately said \"im sorry baby but I'm uncomfortable. I'll wait for you right here and you can show me what you bought the second we get back to the bedroom\". \n\nThat is the correct communication. Not whatever strategy OP's partner was using. It isn't immature, it isn't stupid, it isn't even frigidity... consent works in all parts of the world.", "100pct right, she try to bulldoze him, didn't respect his boundaries/wishes, and then completely lost it and acted impulsively/rashly by ending the entire outing in protest and as 'punishment' for not going against his own boundaries and subjecting himself to hers.\n\nThe fact that people can't see that here is insane!", "Yup. A lot of people don't like shopping for sexy things in person. Actually, what if the OP is asexual and not into sex at all, should he still be pressured to shop with her? Everything is about sex on Reddit.", "Just because I understood doesn\u2019t mean everyone understood, I will again point to the example of France and Germany.  Those are well developed European nations with very little presence, it\u2019s completely reasonable that someone from those countries doesn\u2019t know what VS is.   \n  \nIt\u2019s really weird that you are getting this pissed off that someone decided to explain what something was in a post instead of assuming everyone knows what it is, lol.", "I worked at the Canadian version of VS. One Christmas, I had to help a boyfriend who didn't know his girlfriend's bra size, so he was trying to figure it out by palming the cups and judging by feel. He was so relieved when I showed him where to find the bra size on the tag for future reference.", "I mean it's been a long time since it's been the case but Victoria's Secret used to be directly targeted towards men to shop there for their wives", "Yep I have a VS sports bra from 8 years ago that still looks brand new, not even the print has faded with being washed at least once a month all those years. Bought a bra last year that\u2019s already stretched and not a good fit anymore. Go figure", "Someone else mentioned that.\n\nI don't use their products but my parents buy enough that I can tell now that you mention it. Lol", "It may have taken me 10 minutes to remember the actual name and not type bed bath and beyond at first. \n\nTell your dad this 28 year old woman has the same struggle lol", "Eh, sometimes that's not enough. Some people need to hear the \"and we can pick out something you can pull off later ;)\" tacked on or whatever. Some folks are real oblivious, myself included, and extra help is needed to bridge the gap of comprehesion!", "I think it's common to have the fantasy that one's partner can read their every sexual whim and desire and act accordingly, but that's something that in reality only comes with time and experience with a person.  If you put the work into communicating about boundaries and pleasure both, you eventually get to have something very close to that fantasy, but safely and honestly (dropping hints is manipulative, not honest).\n\nJudging cautious reality by that fantasy is why everyone thinks healthy relationships are passionless or some nonsense.", "This! The first time a partner told me it made him uncomfortable, I decided not to shop it that day. When we got home, I asked if he wanted to help me pick one out online. We picked a handful together curled up half naked under a blanket, I modeled some of the styles I had in my closet or explained what I liked and didn't like, we had a ton of fun and then later that week I went to the shop to try on what we picked. I sent pictures from the dressing room, and we picked our favorite together. He said he'd NEVER had an experience with this kind of thing that was so fun and playful and comfortable for him.", "Ah yes, the \u201csister size\u201d nonsense. Which just means, \u201cwe don\u2019t have your size but but you\u2019ll be able to put it on and I\u2019ll get my commission.\u201d", "I went to VS for a fitting years ago for shits and giggles because I was with a friend who is a B cup. I am very much NOT a B. I was wearing a DD at the time and they tried saying I was a much smaller size because of course they didn't carry my size", "Omg Yes this was the reason I only went in once. I have a small frame but a larger cup size. I  told the sales lady what size I was, and I couldn't find any on the shelves. She literally looked at my chest, scoffed, told me I could fit into a D, and pointed me to the changing rooms. Yea, it didn't come close to fitting. Walked out disappointed.", "VS is horrendous for not fitting people correctly. I used to work in a department store in their lingerie department and we were constantly having to refit people. They would complain their bras didn't fit comfortably, you could look and see the size was all wrong and they'd tell you they had got fitted at VS.", "The US in general has some serious hang ups with Cup size.  Most stores don't carry over a D cup and most women wear the wrong size bra as a result.  A D cup is thought of as huge in the US when in reality it isn't that big.", "While that is all incredibly valid and fair, I have never in my life seen a man called a creep for going into VS with his girlfriend, and this is coming from a woman who has had a boyfriend wait outside that store for me with no problem", "I knew when I first got fitted there. I\u2019m a 46H. I side eyed the sales clerk\u2026", "Have you tried Pepper? I am a 40A, it's hard to find, they're the only bras that fit me", "Bra band extenders. Look them up.", "The \u201csister size\u201d crap is such BS. I am an F. I WILL NOT FIT IN A D CUP.", "That's such a standard size, so weird that they had nothing!", "A true sister size would be okay and maybe even better\n\nBut not a 40c when (at that time) I was a 36G \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThat's a distant cousin NOT a sister!!!!", "No, most should be wearing over a D cup. Most people are measuring wrong. 40AA would be a completely flat chest with a 40 inch underbust. Check r/abrathatfits", "But if she had a specific reason for wanting him to go in, like you suggested, then she needs to say that directly. He obviously didn't get it the first time. So she needs to use her words and tell him what she wants and why it's so important to her. He was clear when he told her why he didn't want to go in. So she can do the same for him.", "But why do we assume that's why she wanted him in there?", "Wow yes that sounds like a complicated size. I'm a 34D and they don't even carry that in standard big volume stores like H&M. I've worn 36C for years before I finally got a good fitting. But I've started wearing sport bras since I broke an elbow and now I'm never going back to under wire \ud83d\ude07", "40A here but otherwise the same experience haha", "A DDD is an F, just so you know. A DD would be the same as an E.", "From my experience, they also run out of common sizes pretty easily :/", "Yes, but it kind of depends on the reason. \n\nIf you're just squeamish about underwear, you'll need to get over that eventually.\n\nIt reminds me of guys who are too scared to buy pads and other stuff for their partners."]}
