For those of you who don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a women\u2019s underwear store. When my girlfriend went in I just stayed outside of the store and sat on a bench. She was confused and came back to me and asked why I didn\u2019t come with her. I told her because it\u2019s a women\u2019s underwear store I don\u2019t want to go inside. She got kind of mad and told me that nobody cares so just come. I refused because I feel weird going into a store like that and don\u2019t want to make the women there feel uncomfortable. My girlfriend get upset and decided to end the day and go home. She said I ruined the day by not going into a freaking store.", "created_utc": 1681737990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pfxov/aita_m20_for_not_going_inside_victorias_secret/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may have wanted you there because she wanted to pick out lingerie that you would like, which could be why she was so  upset that you wouldn't go in with her.", "NAH - Dude, she's not mad at you for not going into the store. She's mad at you for not going into the store *with her*.\n\nShe wanted to do something fun, flirty and a bit naughty with you. And you goofed.", "You're NTA for not going in if you didn't want to, but you whiffed this one hoss.\n\nShe wanted to see what you liked. She probably wanted to pick something to appeal to you. No women in the store care when they see a man with his lady or a man by themselves. Plenty shop there for gifts for SOs (or themselves! Pretty underthings are for anyone who wants to wear them).\n\nDont let your hangups cockblock you my friend.", "NAH - it's not a crime to be socially awkward, and it's not a crime for her to get frustrated when you can't get over it so you two can have fun.\n\nIt wasn't the women in the shop that would have been uncomfortable, it's you.  So while I'm not going to say either of you is the AH here, it feels likely that you two aren't going to work out if you're so clearly not on the same page.\n\nGood luck", "NTA\u2026.but kinda dumb. You have very young relationship vibes. You are nta for me because you are entitled to not go into a store if you don\u2019t want to and she way overreacted. \n\nIdk about your area, but at the Victoria Secret in my mall the population is about 50/50 shopping there, as in half men, half women. Women who would be extremely uncomfortable about a man being there (not a reasonable expectation fyi) shop online, not in a mall. \n\nSo if you are at the point in your relationship where you see your girlfriend\u2019s underwear\u2026it\u2019s pretty clear to me she wanted you to come help her pick out undergarments you would enjoy seeing on her. Definitely missed a big sign here. She went around it the wrong way, but I think she is feeling a bit rejected. She might have thought it would be fun and sexy for you to help her select something. You both definitely need to talk it out. Good luck!", "INFO: Is your relationship with your gf the type in which you might see her in her underwear?", "You do know she might have been shopping for your benefit, don't you? Maybe wanted your input?\\\n\\\nNAH, nevertheless.", "Lol. NTA, but this is just silly. A man tagging along with his SO isn\u2019t going to make any women in there feel uncomfortable. You should\u2019ve instead told your gf that *you\u2019re* uncomfortable (actual truth) and not blamed all the other unsuspecting customers. It\u2019s just undies, go in the store next time.\n\n\nEdit: if you are truly that uncomfortable, your gf should be more understanding. She\u2019s pretty immature for letting it \u201cruin\u201d the day. She could try being a little less self centered and more understanding. That is, when you actually tell her how *you* feel, instead of putting it on others.", "INFO: why did you feel uncomfortable going in?", "I dont think anyone particularly sucks here  \n\n\nyour girlfriend wanted to see what lingerie you liked (you refusing to go in thwarted her plans)  \n\n\nyou didnt want to go in (which is fine, although maybe you should have been clear about that.)  \n\n\nthe only thing I would say is that your assumption that people will think your a creep is unfounded, if you were going in by yourself to perve that would be one thing, going in with your partner and looking at what she is interested is different, keep your eyes on your girl and everything is fine.", "NTA. But honestly, it\u2019s kinda silly. Men often go into lingerie stores, with or without their partners and no one bats an eyelid. Done it by myself often. How are you going to act if, heaven forbid, your GF asks you to pick up some tampons for her? Freak out then too. You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing but I went with NTA because you just need to work through your awkwardness and grow up a little.", "Oh my gosh, thank you for giving me a laugh this morning! \ud83d\ude02\n\nNAH\n\nAs long as you don't touch the models and have female guide, you won't be silently cursed.", "Looks like you totally missed her hint at wanting to get your input on some lingerie etc. So NTA but you fumbled the sexy time bag.", "NTA. People on here need to relax. I don\u2019t want to go into these stores either because it doesn\u2019t appeal to me.

You\u2019re not going to make other women uncomfortable in a store. It\u2019s a store. Behave as you would in any other store. \n\n2. She wanted you to come in a get your opinion on what she would buy or look good in. Since you\u2019re the person who would be seeing her wearing it.\n\nYou really shot yourself in the foot. Your GF asked you to come help her pick out underwear. NTA for not wanting to go in, but you\u2019ve got to understand she was asking for validation from you and probably wanted to flirt. Considering you are currently the only person she would parade around in her underwear for, she wanted you to be interested in that. \n\nNot going in does not you an AH. But your future self might not agree.\n\nEdit: in future, if you don\u2019t want to go in express that it makes you uncomfortable but you\u2019d still like to see what she\u2019s interested in so she can send you pics of whatever it is she\u2019s looking at. You stay out of the store you don\u2019t want to go into, while still showing interest in your girlfriend and what she might be looking to share with you. But seriously. If you can go to a store and not behave like a creep then there\u2019s no reason to be uncomfortable.", "Lol I don\u2019t think YTA per se but since you\u2019re young I\u2019m gunna give you a little advice picking out sexy clothes for your partner isn\u2019t just a female thing. Maybe she wanted your input on something that would make you happy.", "Let me give you some advice. One day you might want to buy this girl some nice lingerie or underwear. Go inside. Pay attention. Be a grown adult.", "NTA. After being told I can't go near a changing area my wife was using in a non-underwear store, I can absolutely understand as a man not wanting to make women uncomfortable by walking to a Victoria's Secret store. Given you can totally just wait outside without hurting anyone I don't see why this would make you TA.", "NTA, but man. You missed out.", "NAH. You\u2019re both very young, it\u2019s not that big of a deal in the long run. Maybe she wanted your opinion on something, it would have been nice to go with her if she wanted you with her. But at the end of the day if you don\u2019t feel comfortable going in, then she can\u2019t force you.\n\nTry not to worry too much about it. Communicate with your girlfriend clearly exactly how you feel and maybe try a little harder to go into the store with her next time if she wants your opinion on something.", "NTA, but you should have gone in: You certainly could have found a pair of big-girl panties to put on.", "NTA I love shopping fancy underwear but I would also respect my boyfriend's comfort zone and he'd done the exact same thing.", "In case you didn't know, she was wanting your help picking something to wear on your next trip to pound town. Your refusal made her feel rejected and embarrassed which is why she lashed out.\n\nHowever you are NTA for your side of this. \n\nHow about ask her with compassion if she felt bad that you blew off what she thought was a sexual activity/foreplay type situation? Then discuss it without either of you dismissing how the other feels.", "NTA, \n\nThis is something that gets better with time, the women in there aren\u2019t uncomfortable unless your staring at them or making them uncomfortable. If you\u2019re just browsing with your partner no one cares.\n\nI remember being incredibly uncomfortable underwear shopping with girlfriends around that age but 20 years later if my wife wants to go underwear shopping with my I\u2019m all in. I get to make suggestions, sometimes requests and sometimes I even get surprises that she buys without telling me so it\u2019s become a fun thing. \n\nIf she\u2019s doing something mind-numbingly boring like getting a salon treatment or her nails done I\u2019ll tell her to text me when she\u2019s done and I\u2019ll go hang out in the local hobby shop as she doesn\u2019t like heading in there as she finds it boring.", "NTA\n\nIt's funny how everyone here preaches about boundaries but then suddenly this guy is an AH for enforcing his own.\n\nHis gf doesn't need him there. Pushing him to come and getting angry shows how immature she is", "NTA. I get why you didn\u2019t feel comfortable and you communicated your feelings when she asked.\n\nAnd your GF handled it wrong. If she was trying to be flirty, then she could have communicated better vs throwing a tempter tantrum.", "NTA, there's really nothing wrong with you going into the shop, but if you don't want to for whatever reason then your gf should try to understand and certainly shouldn't get upset with you. Maybe she just wanted you to help her pick cute underwear or something and got upset because of that.", "ESH it\u2019s lame you\u2019re weird about going into a store and it\u2019s uncool of her to not respect that you\u2019re weird.", "YTA\n\nI don't think most women are going to have any issue with you being in there when you are with your girlfriend. And if you were going around with a store employee because you're wanting some help navigating women's lingerie to get her a gift, they'd understand that too. And the fact that she wanted you to go in says that she wanted your input for something that you'd like seeing her in during bedroom fun time. I can understand her being upset because a lot of men refuse to go into those stores simply because \"that's for girls and I'm a guy and I won't be caught dead in there.\" Maybe put on your big boy shorts, apologize, and suggest going back, yeah?", "LOL. YTA. and childish. You can't be serious!", "Esh you can learn some things about her while shes browses like her tastes or hints on what to get her\n\nYoure both ridiculously stubborn over a trip to store", "YTA, man up and, most importantly, grow up. It's clothing. She might want your opinion on some pieces. And for other women in there, if they see a young man genuinly helping his GF to make some choices, why would they feel uncomfortable. Just don't stare at them, focus on your GF.\n\nI am with my wife when she goes shopping for underwear, i ask what exactly she wants and then i look around if i can find something suitable for her. Keeping in mind that \"looking sexy\" isn't the only factor but also comfort. Not all underwear is for sexy time, most is for everyday use.\n\nSo again, grow up, man up. It's just clothing.", "NTA.\n\nIf you don't want to go into you shouldn't have too. And you're right, a lot of women probably don't feel comfortable having strange men walking around the store while they look at underwear.\n\nThe fact the your GF then overreacts by saying you ruined the day is a massive red flag. I know you're only 20 but it seems like a very immature reaction and not very respectful of your boundaries.", "Nta, just an idiot tbh. As every other comment says,  she probably wanted help in picking out lingerie for you....", "She overreacted but you can definitely go in to Victoria's secret lol.", "well we know now the op wont go in there to birthday or christmas shop for his gf lol", "Mild TYA. Like, \"if salt was a spice\" mild.\n\nThe AH bit, is only because it sounds like you should have communicated that you weren't going to go in before she went in. The rest is No-Ass, but I do want to address not wanting to go in.\n\nI mean, not wanting to go in is fine, but I honestly think you should work on that.\n\nYou give the reason that other customers might think it's creepy; it's really not in VS. \n\nAnyway, here's a guide on how not to be a creep in a lingerie store: you go in with your girlfriend, you look at what she looks at, and you don't look at/hit on other women in the store. Just stick by her, and keep her company while she shops.\n\nAlso, I really want to point out that she *might* have wanted a little sexy conversation in there. Like, talking what sort of things you might like to see her wear in bed, then sending you outside the store before making her purchases, so there'd still be an element of surprise when she models them later. (That's just one scenario) \n\nBut ALL of that requires you having enough confidence to be in a lingerie store with your girlfriend. Not having that confidence doesn't make you an AH, but I'd really suggest you work on it, because it might make for more fun times shopping with your gf.\n\nEdit: I also want to mention that VS is both an underwear store, and an lingerie store. The underwear only stuff (aka underwear that only she will see) tends to be in a very separate section from lingerie (stuff that's designed to be *seen* - it's the \"sexy\" underwear that you wear for your partner). It's an important distinction, and the vibe in each area is different. You'll see more men in lingerie sections than where you get your standard 5-pack of panties.", "NTA leaning towads n a h \n\nNta purely because she says you ruined the day,, its clear that you were uncomfortable and you also didn't want anyone else to be. It just sounds like you two should discuss boundaries and what your comfortable with, I'd your girlfriend blowing past your comforts when out is well into AH territory.", "NTA. If a guy doesn't want to go in a store that sells mostly womens underwear thats totally fine. If she realy wanted you to pick something out for her, she should have toled you. I personally prefer picking out what I like and my SO gets what they get.", "NAH. However My ex always refused to go into lingerie or sex toy stores or give feedback on styles which was really frustrating. Whereas my partner now its a fun sexy trip picking this together and trying on and I know he likes whats ive chosen and have a better idea or styles or toys that could be fun. Your girlfriend just wanted that, a fun time and to find items you find sexy on her- so your refusal is a disapointment abd a downer. its partially for your own benefit to go in!\n\nAlso no one is gonna be uncomfortable, it's not like your walking in on women wearing them.", "Congratulations NAH but you cock blocked yourself there mate. Next time she's like let's go into the shop that sells sexy underwear you put ya big boy pants on and get in there as she's looking for you not her", "I mean she probably overreacted by ending the day early but it seems kind of juvenile to me to refuse to go into a victoria's secret because you're a man. i'm a lesbian so this isn't a problem i've encountered with partners, maybe it's just hard for me to understand. either way NAH.", "If you genuinely don't feel comfortable going in there then she shouldn't really have pressured you, but it's a shame you feel that way because I really don't think you need to.\n\nIt's not \"weird\" for men to be in stores like that, and it isn't going to make women feel uncomfortable unless you're trying to follow them into the changing rooms! And I bet one of the most common thing the staff deal with is men who are looking to buy gifts and need help because \"excuse me, how do bra sizes work?\"\n\nAlso, it seems pretty obvious that she thought it would be fun/cute/exciting for you to pick something out together that _you'd then get to see her in_. She wants to know what _you'd_ like because... I'm sure I don't need to explain. Did you consider that not wanting to do that with her might make her feel rejected in some way?\n\nIt's easy to say she overreacted, but I think you have to consider that her reaction isn't about just not wanting to go in a shop with her. Obviously it's not really what happened but what she may well have been feeling was that she said \"let's do something a bit sexy together\" and your reaction was \"absolutely not - I don't want to do sexy things with you and I'm disgusted that you think I would.\" That's hyperbole, but you get what I mean.\n\nI'm going with NAH, but I think there's a bit of growing up to be done and ideally a bit better communication between the two of you. It's mainly just a shame that you both came away from the situation feeling bad when it could have been something really fun that brought you a lot closer.", "NAH but no one cares if you\u2019re there. No one. Not a single person. Women\u2019s underwear is just clothing. There\u2019s no reason to be so weird about bras, you\u2019re an adult. You don\u2019t have to go in if you don\u2019t want to but it\u2019s just a piece of fabric it\u2019s not gonna bite you", "NTA", "YTA, and am missing out on some fun stuff! WHY would you not want to..", "YTA\nBRUH. she probably wanted to model some shit for you. Way to ensure she never wears lingerie for you.\n \n>For those of you who don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a women\u2019s underwear store.\n\n It's fabric on mannequins. You feel weird about seeing fabric on mannequins... Why? It makes zero sense.", "NAH. It is okay that you felt uncomfortable, but this plotline sounds straight out of an anime.\n\nMaybe she wanted to go inside with you to ask you which kind of underwear you like. So you just missed out a great opportunity in my opinion", "I will say this. No one does care. But if you do that\u2019s enough. How you could turn the day by not going into Victoria Secrets is beyond me. I go with NTA.", "NTA. Regardless of the store, you said you didn't want to go in, obviously didn't stop her from going in and found a place to situate yourself so she could shop. Does she have some kind of disability that she needs you around to help her? If not, then her reaction is over the top and uncalled for. To say you ruined the day because you didn't want to go into one store is ridiculous.", "NTA, but you both are immature and you're using woman's discomfort as a cover for your own.", "NTA. Victoria's Secret is a sketchy exploitative company owned by a friend of Jeffrey Epstine and designed to make women and girls feel bad about themselves to buy more crappy ill fitting lingerie", "NTA \nWhat does she men, nobody cares? You care! You are not a nobody. \nSecondly, you didn\u2019t ruin anything by not going into the store. She just made an issue out of a non issue. Couples often shop together and then one stays outside if tired or not interested in the specific shop.", "NTA, your reason makes sense (though men there with their spouses is not unusual). I expect you may have missed some signals in what her expectations were here. It's possible she wanted this part of shopping to be a gateway to some sort of intimacy, and her anger stems from it not going as expected.\n\nJust talk it out and you'll be fine.", "ESH \n\nYou both need to grow up.", "Borderline NTA because you are being considerate of how other female shoppers may feel.\n\nHowever, maybe you are reading too much into how people feel generally , and you failed to read into the specific situation in front of you.", "Omg. Grow up. It\u2019s just underwear. \ud83d\ude44\n\nESH.", "ESH.  \n\n\nUnderwear is nothing magical it's just cloth you wear on your private parts. You should grow up. What will you do when your gf asks you to buy pads for her during that time of the month if you are scared to go into the store with underwear.  \n\n\nAlso if your gf's day is ruined by you not going to the store then oh boy what a fragile being she is.  \n\n\nYou both need to grow up.", "\"don\u2019t want to make the women there feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nThat's a very good and considerate reason for not going in. I don't understand why your gf reacted the she did. NTA.", "ESH, nobody will care if you go. You won't be the first guy that goes there to 1) accompany your partner 2) Get a gift for your partner or 3) I'm sure this also happened but get stuff for yourself. But also her saying that it ruined the day for you to not go is overreaction too.", "NTA, I always think it\u2019s hilarious when there\u2019s a woman in VS towing a clearly uncomfortable guy around, double if he\u2019s carrying a bunch of shopping bags and she\u2019s carrying 0. \n\nDid she need your opinion for something? Was she trying things on for you? Doubtful and it\u2019s not like they would have let you in the room with her. \n\nShe sounds bossy and controlling.", "ESH but lightly. You're both still acting like children.\n\n It's a store, I go in with my girlfriend, and my girl friends, and never have I ever gotten so much as a second glance. So relax.\n\nAs for your girlfriend, she has to know your comfort is as important as hers and getting mad at you isn't the way to have a discussion or relationship.", "NTA, because I see your point and your gf totally went overboard with her reaction.", "NTA. My 60+ husband, years ago, went to a mall with a Christmas list(he liked shopping, me, not so much). One of the things on the list was a gift card from Victoria's Secret for our adult daughter. He said going in there made him feel like a 'creepy stalker guy'. This from a man with a wife, a grown daughter, and 4 granddaughters. You're 20. Give yourself a pass.", "NTA. You definitely are not the only male who refuses to step foot in that store. Your girlfriend was acting childish for not respecting your choice.", "Not at all.  NTA\n\nLots of men feel uncomfortable, or at least a little shady, going into such shops. Lots of women feel uncomfortable with men in the shop.  Don't feel you have to be there - you could just be respectful of those who want to choose their knickers in peace :)  \n\n\nBTW your GF is an idiot in this situation - not respecting your choice, not respecting others shopping, then having a toddler tantrum. Have you considered dating a grown-up?", "You are obviously young and it sounds like you may be pretty sheltered in life. NAH and it's not wrong that you stayed within your comfort zone. But you will have more fun in the future if you push yourself a bit. A mall with your gf is a pretty safe scenario to try something new.", "I guess it\u2019s NAH.

I don't go in there either. Don't need a reason.", "NTA she is for ending the whole day out because you didn't want to go into one clothing store, you didn't stop her, you didn't judge her, you just hanged back because you didn't feel comfortable going into a store that souly sells womens underwear and maybe sleep wear/sex toys.\n\nShe could have gone in with the hopes of you helping her pick out sexy lingerie you both may enjoy, but she didn't communicate any of that, just ended the outing.", "You both sound like complete snowflakes\u2026", "ESH", "NTA, but your gf is. Men get unpleasant looks, scowls, etc in places like Victoria's Secret. There are things society prefers men not to do, and going into women's underwear stores are one of them. Some people will do or say bizarre things to men in such places, such as calling police. It does not happen often, but it does happen. If your girlfriend does not understand that and why you would prefer to avoid that risk, you should find a different partner. Your partner should support and protect you, not berate you for a reasonable concern and a reasonable course of action", "NTA for not wanting the other women to feel uncomfortable, but I wouldn't really care if your partner had brought you there for feedback, which is *very* easy to surmise from the scenario. So I'll say YTA because you kind of lackes emotional intelligence here.", "YTA you weren\u2019t being a creep.  If you\u2019re that uncomfortable in a woman centric space you\u2019re clearly very immature.\n\nAlso broseph she was going to buy something sexy and wanted to know what you liked.

She got kind of mad and told me that nobody cares so just come. I refused because I feel weird going into a store like that and don\u2019t want to make the women there feel uncomfortable. My girlfriend get upset and decided to end the day and go home. She said I ruined the day by not going into a freaking store.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With that said though, you did massively misunderstand what she really wanted. Let me tell you a secret my guy, women don't take guys to Victoria's Secret for no reason. They do it because they want you to tell them they're beautiful. She wanted you come in, help her pick out something you thought was sexy, then tell her how beautiful she is, how amazingly sexy she is, and how much she means to you. She wanted to hear you say it (even if you've said it before, she wanted you to say it again) and you refused, so now she's gonna be questioning herself, wondering if she actually is beautiful. Go talk to her man, tell her you're an ass, that you didn't realize it was so important, and most of all, tell her you're sorry. \n\nI also understand why you're uncomfortable, you're a man this is a women's clothing store specializing in undergarments. But plenty of guys go there either with their girlfriends, or to buy something they'd seen their gfs/wives looking at in the catalog as a gift. So you're more than likely not gonna make some one uncomfortable.

But even as someone who cares, I only care if the man is standing outside the changing room doors preventing me from cracking the door open to get the workers help.

I have actually had some pretty gross experiences in VS, where men I don\u2019t know try to talk to me or ask me whether I like something in a creepy and invasive way.  I do think you need to be extra sensitive in a store like that and ideally not approach or talk to women you don\u2019t know. However, if you mind your own business and are not being a creep, there is no issue with you joining your partner in VS.  It also may be good for you - it is positive and beneficial to communicate about sex and sex adjacent things with your partner without shame and embarrassment, and to the extent you are feeling any of that, communication and new experiences will be helpful to you and your relationship.", "Hahaha oh dude everyone judges you for not going into the store with her.", "Any chance you were raised conservative?", "It\u2019s just a shop.
