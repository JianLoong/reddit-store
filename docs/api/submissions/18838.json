I read a while ago that in my country, kids sharing bedrooms is now considered a sign of poverty and thought how bloody ridiculous that is! \n\nNot getting to eat the food she likes isn't usually something I'd think it's a big deal but if she's neuro diverse she may have genuine problems with eating some types of food.\n\nBut frankly, after checking that there's no serious issue happening when she's at her mum's house, I would work on explaining to her why it's important to have a relationship with her mum.

That said, if mom could find a way to give her her own space over there, I'd bet it would go a long way to soothe your daughter's nerves.  ADHD has a fun issue called object permanence.  If something is moved even an inch or turned even slightly so that the visual we expect isn't the one we see our brain will remove the item from our sight.  The stress it causes a person with ADHD to share a space with someone else is high because there is no way they can avoid touching her stuff when she's only there for a few days a month.  Once something is moved, it's lost to her for a while and causes a great deal of anxiety in most people with ADHD.

Even if she has straight ADHD it's still very relevant. Does mum use the same support strategies? \n\nYour child is communicating her distress. You don't have to understand it to believe her. \n\nYou are exhausted. I get that. But you're a parent. That means the kids' needs come first.

So naturally, she doesn't want to go. No kid wants to be forced to spend time with someone they don't really know and who their main parent doesn't like. Have you told your daughter that her mother wants to spend time with her, but you made sure that she could only see her one weekend every month? Make her realise that her mother does care about her, and didn't abandon her?", "YTA. It will fuck your child even more up if you force her to do something she doesn't want to do (trust me, I've been through it and also have adhd). Right now you're just being selfish. Why did you even got full custody if you still want to get rid of your child and offer her the shittiest solution possible? You can literally let anyone babysit her, but you choose your ex even if your daughter was screaming and begging you? Why?

Because my kids come first. They love both of us and I wasn't about to let their relationship with their dad slip because he couldn't make his home safe.\n\nMake your home an ADHD friendly place. Learn to set safe boundaries. My kids know that if I put myself in time out, they need to leave me alone for a bit. Build your own support network, find trustworthy babysitters, make friends, reach out to your family (if you have them and they're safe people), get therapy, whatever.\n\nJust stop making it out to be your child's or ex's fault that you don't have the downtime you want.

Honestly, I would never send my child somewhere they were uncomfortable or didn\u2019t feel like was a safe place. Yes, it is her mother\u2019s house, but what is she really scared of when she goes?

Not even one weekend a month off! And I think that YTA, for not having open dialogue with a 10yo. For not listening to her. For not trying to find a compromise. Even if that were not sleeping there.\n\nWhat you're saying is that you don't want to be around your own child, because your own needs come before hers.

I'm just saying this because it really could be anything that is upsetting your daughter about staying with her Mum.", "YTA. Can't your mum take their child for the weekend? You asked for custody!

There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s crying and begging to not go. I think this is a deeper issue than food and sharing a room. Especially if you fought so hard for custody and she only has visits once a month.

You need to be pretty damn sure that living arrangements and food is REALLY all there is to it.   \nI've had this happen on separate occasions to two cousins of mine. Both turned out that abuse was going on, one was verbal abuse by his mother, he was 7, the other cousin was getting death threats and physical abuse from his stepfather...he was 10. in both cases it had been going on for a while but only when the kids finally broke down and pitched the mother of all fits did their other parents/guardian went to the courts. It took a few conversations with child psychologists to get the kids to spill the truth. and the courts acted accordingly.", "YTA   There's definitely a bigger reason then what your daughter is telling  you.

You don't know what goes on there", "Unless it was decided by court she has to go, which I feel like isn't the case here, YTA. Your mom might be able to watch her for a day or 2 if you need some rest? It's okay to need a few days to yourself, but your daughter's reaction is too extreme to ignore. She is not a toddler in her terrible 2s, she is a 10 year old girl who knows very well what she says. As the reaction is extreme, I would be very allarmed that something more might be going on in that home and I would not take my child there if I don't have to. Try to ask her and talk to her what is going on, you might find out more to work with. And ask someone you and she trust to go to for a day so you can destress. Again, your mom sounds like a great option.", "YTA for the complete lack of concern for your daughters safety/feelings. However without legal reason to withhold visitation I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for having your daughter go because ultimately while I may not agree with it legally she\u2019s required to be there if there isn\u2019t anything bad going on", "NTA IF you made sure that there's nothing going on there.\n\nI have ADHD and being my parents was hard. Also, many ADHD brains refuse to function if you need to work hard or if things are overwhelming or uncomfortable. I think different rules and expectations can set her off. Living and functioning in two different surroundings is much work and effort.  Not wanting to share a room is totally understandable as a reason! But it's not reason enough. Especially people with ADHD have to learn that they have to do things even if they are uncomfortable. How is she doing when she's at her moms? Does she feel okay then, or is she still wanting to go home?\n\nAlso, no judge will keep a child from their parent because the food isn't good...Doesn't matter what we think. \n\nYou should try to find solutions together. Not why she doesn't want to go, but what should change. She doesn't like the food? Well, which food would she like?  It will become more clear how serious her problems are. Does she want only chocolate and fries? Or is she asking for fruit and vegetables?

It's good for her, to see her mother. As long as there is no abuse, I would certainly continue to encourage the visits. That she has to share a room or doesn't like the food is not a good reason to cut the contact.\n\nMy daughter went through a phase where she complained to her father about me and complained to me about her father. The three of us had a conversation. And guess what, she thought she had to do this, because she thought she would make us happy with this. No idea how she got this idea, we never talk bad about each other. Certainly not in her presence.\n\nTalk to her calmly. If possible with her mother. Ask her what you/her mother can do, to make the visits easier.\nI am very much in favor of contact with both parents, as long as it is safe to do so.", "NTA Kids gotta learn sometimes the food sucks.

Parents need time to themselves too and with ADHD it can be really tiring. And add on being single. This is something I read about all the time, that we demonize parents who don't do everything for their child and then turn around and say they should take more time for themselves. You can't win. \n\nI don't believe in just giving into everything a child asks for (though I do believe in listening to their concerns pretty closely), and under most circumstances I think it's best to try to foster a relationship with both parents. The court ordered her to go 1x a month for a reason and if OP goes against that it could entail consequences, legal or otherwise. If it really is just that she doesn't like the food or the bedroom sharing, then tough. Esp the food is something that can be worked on. But I would further investigate if there are other reasons she doesn't want to go.\n\nOP, I don't think you're an AH for needing a weekend to yourself, but I would try to see if there's something else more problematic going on at your ex's house that your daughter is having trouble expressing explicitly.", "NTA maybe. Some have said that your child's reluctance to go to her mum's might be as a result of something untoward but it might be the child being awkward. \n\nMy kids live across 2 households and sometimes they play up about going to mum's/dad's but I know my ex and there's no real reason there other than the kids wanting their own way. As such I'll put my foot down and tell them they have to come/go. \n\nIn this instance it's up to you to determine the reason for your child's reluctance, which is no doubt exacerbated by her neuro divergency. Once a month isn't really enough to establish routine for a neuro divergent child which is probably why she's doesn't want to go.\n\nIt's not fair to keep her from her mum without a valid reason, also you are entitled to a break once in a while to recharge your batteries to be a better parent when you do have her.", "NAH\n\nI dont know why people think she is being abused by her mom.
