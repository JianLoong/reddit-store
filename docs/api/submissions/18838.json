If something is moved even an inch or turned even slightly so that the visual we expect isn't the one we see our brain will remove the item from our sight.  The stress it causes a person with ADHD to share a space with someone else is high because there is no way they can avoid touching her stuff when she's only there for a few days a month.

Both turned out that abuse was going on, one was verbal abuse by his mother, he was 7, the other cousin was getting death threats and physical abuse from his stepfather...he was 10. in both cases it had been going on for a while but only when the kids finally broke down and pitched the mother of all fits did their other parents/guardian went to the courts. It took a few conversations with child psychologists to get the kids to spill the truth. and the courts acted accordingly.", "YTA   There's definitely a bigger reason then what your daughter is telling  you.

Your mom might be able to watch her for a day or 2 if you need some rest? It's okay to need a few days to yourself, but your daughter's reaction is too extreme to ignore. She is not a toddler in her terrible 2s, she is a 10 year old girl who knows very well what she says. As the reaction is extreme, I would be very allarmed that something more might be going on in that home and I would not take my child there if I don't have to. Try to ask her and talk to her what is going on, you might find out more to work with. And ask someone you and she trust to go to for a day so you can destress. Again, your mom sounds like a great option.", "YTA for the complete lack of concern for your daughters safety/feelings.

Also, many ADHD brains refuse to function if you need to work hard or if things are overwhelming or uncomfortable. I think different rules and expectations can set her off. Living and functioning in two different surroundings is much work and effort.  Not wanting to share a room is totally understandable as a reason! But it's not reason enough. Especially people with ADHD have to learn that they have to do things even if they are uncomfortable. How is she doing when she's at her moms? Does she feel okay then, or is she still wanting to go home?\n\nAlso, no judge will keep a child from their parent because the food isn't good...Doesn't matter what we think. \n\nYou should try to find solutions together. Not why she doesn't want to go, but what should change. She doesn't like the food? Well, which food would she like?  It will become more clear how serious her problems are. Does she want only chocolate and fries? Or is she asking for fruit and vegetables?

That she has to share a room or doesn't like the food is not a good reason to cut the contact.\n\nMy daughter went through a phase where she complained to her father about me and complained to me about her father.

Parents need time to themselves too and with ADHD it can be really tiring. And add on being single. This is something I read about all the time, that we demonize parents who don't do everything for their child and then turn around and say they should take more time for themselves. You can't win. \n\nI don't believe in just giving into everything a child asks for (though I do believe in listening to their concerns pretty closely), and under most circumstances I think it's best to try to foster a relationship with both parents. The court ordered her to go 1x a month for a reason and if OP goes against that it could entail consequences, legal or otherwise. If it really is just that she doesn't like the food or the bedroom sharing, then tough. Esp the food is something that can be worked on. But I would further investigate if there are other reasons she doesn't want to go.\n\nOP, I don't think you're an AH for needing a weekend to yourself, but I would try to see if there's something else more problematic going on at your ex's house that your daughter is having trouble expressing explicitly.", "NTA maybe.

As such I'll put my foot down and tell them they have to come/go. \n\nIn this instance it's up to you to determine the reason for your child's reluctance, which is no doubt exacerbated by her neuro divergency. Once a month isn't really enough to establish routine for a neuro divergent child which is probably why she's doesn't want to go.\n\nIt's not fair to keep her from her mum without a valid reason, also you are entitled to a break once in a while to recharge your batteries to be a better parent when you do have her.", "NAH\n\nI dont know why people think she is being abused by her mom.

Is there anyone else who can help, sleep over with friends?\n\nParents even in a relationship need an occasional time to themselves, you soloing which is hard mode. \n\nMy only concern is how much your daughter doesn't want to go to mums and how it seems like the mum doesn't want her there instead of embracing it.

I am a single mom to a 10 year old with ADHD too. I went by myself to the Grand Canyon in January. I\u2019m from the east coast. I\u2019ve never been out west. I was flying into Phoenix for a bat mitzvah on the weekend and decided to take a fees before hand to see the GC because I probably would never get the opportunity again. My mom ENCOURAGED me to do it when I was contemplating it. I needed that break. It was three days of peacefulness and relaxation. Just being in my thoughts uninterrupted. My ex never would take my son for even a couple hours and he just recently moved across the state. My babysitting is done all by my parents which I use sparingly because I don\u2019t want them to feel like I\u2019m just using them. So the trip I took was much needed and I was encouraged to do just like I am encouraging you. You\u2019re NTA!! Go enjoy your vacay!\n\nEdit: A word on ADHD. My son refuse to leave the house for any reason. Even if I know and he knows that he\u2019ll have fun there. He\u2019ll come up with excuses, stomp, pout, scream, and yell and throw things. Once we get to said place he tells me every time that he\u2019s excited or had a great time, and I was right. And every time I tell him we\u2019ll maybe we can just leave the house without all the antics since I\u2019m right every time, He says yes, next weekend it\u2019s like last weekend never happened and we\u2019re back to screaming, yelling, pouting about leaving the house. When he\u2019s on meds, this doesn\u2019t happen. But I only gives him meds for school and specific activities. That\u2019s how his meds work, are prescribed, and sanctioned by his doctor. So this is normal ADHD kid behavior. Not liking the food could be food sensory issues, which ND folks tend to have. And not wanting to share a room, I get it. I\u2019m an only child basically too. Sharing rooms is the worst.", "I'm not sure why people are saying 'YTA'. If her only reasons for not wanting to go to her mother's house are that she doesn't like sharing a room or the food is bad, then she needs to learn to get over it and accommodate others.

They have another adult there to lighten the load. They have another adult there that can look after the child while they leave the house. Yes it might not be an entire weekend but it\u2019s definitely child-free time. Being a single parent is hard, especially if the child/children love with you essentially full time. You have to be switched on all of the time! You are absolutely allowed to feel how you\u2019re feeling, it can be exhausting. \n\nIs there a way you can build in child-free time another way?

Can't she go to your mom, a sibling or a friend that you trust ?", "YTA, for multiple reasons. This is a long reply but I'm not sorry, all of it is important. TL;DR at the end.\n\nFor starters, let me rephrase your question, so you can see what it initially sounds like. \"I had a child, that I campaigned to have for the majority of the time, but now I don't want her here because she's too much work.\" Just from that, you'd be the AH.\n\nBut, as a woman with ADHD, the H in it is NOT literal hyperactivity. It shouldn't even be called attention deficit, because we don't have a deficit, we have issues with directing it. Your little girl is active and wants to play, and I can promise you that the time she *WANTS/ASKS* to play with you is limited. Very limited. You might get another year, if you're lucky, where your daughter wants to spend time with you.\n\nAs a woman whose dad didn't want to play or spend time with me, I can tell you that I have up trying. And I gave up early. I was about 7 when I stopped trying to spend time with my dad or get his attention, because I knew, even then that he didn't want to be around me.\n\nI was 7 and I knew my dad didn't want to play with me. Imagine your own daughter, look at her and imagine her saying \"Daddy, I know you don't want me here. I'll go play on my own.\" Imagine knowing that YOU are the reason your daughter won't bother even talking to you soon. And trust me, she *KNOWS* you think she's too much.\n\nOn top of that, girls learn what is acceptable treatment in relationships from their father figures. Hence the expression \"The only man a girl can trust is her daddy.\" From basic psychology and experience, I can tell you what happens when a young girl develops a warped sense of male roles in her life. She goes out of her way, often to her detriment, to appease men in her life, to gain their attention and affection, and she doesn't even realise she's doing it.\n\nShe is slowly learning that she is too much, that she must do as others tell her and that her emotions (which will become harder for her to understand and control in puberty, especially with ADHD) are invalid and unwanted. She will start to struggle to understand them and herself, all the while knowing that her own father, the one who is supposed to love her the most, (because he fought to have almost total custody) doesn't like her.\n\nAnd the crying because she doesn't want to 'share a room' or 'the food sucks'? Yeah, no, that's not a temper tantrum, she is trying to tell you something and she doesn't know exactly how to put it, for whatever reason. You say you know your daughter, but she will feel that you're already pulling away from her, so it's entirely possible she doesn't know how to tell you something is wrong because she already knows you won't listen/don't care. At 10, she knows this. By 12-14, she won't bother telling you anything.\n\nAs far as her being active goes, try to find something she enjoys and do it with her. The ADHD brain lacks the dopamine to control where our attention goes, so we end up hyper-fixated on the wrong thing or hopping from one thing to another. Trust me in this. I wish I'd been diagnosed as a child, instead of age 37, it would have made my life easier and better.\n\nOh, one last thing. The reason I'm writing ALL of this is because I hope anybody reading who is in/has had/is facing the same situations can avoid them. If I can stop ANYBODY from experiencing my childhood or the way I'm stuck now, it's worth it. I wouldn't want anybody to ever feel the way I've felt.\n\nYTA, but you can learn to change it and not be.

It\u2019s not because you want your daughter to spend time with her mother; it\u2019s because you want a break from her. That\u2019s why YTA: for making it seem like you don\u2019t particularly care what your daughter wants, you just want your weekend off.", "I was about 7 or 8 when I decided I wanted to do every other weekend with my dad, instead of every weekend. Yes I have ADHD, and no, that wasn\u2019t part of the reason for me. There was no physical abuse, I was fed and kept safe, etc etc. Thankfully my mom listened and allowed me to cut him out of my life completely at age 11 after spending a miserable summer with him after he moved cross-country, where his true feelings came out and he told me he wished I was never born and to find a way to the airport (3 hrs away) by myself if I wanted to go home early. You know your wife is cold, but please save your daughter from any more emotional or psychological pain from her mother. I am still dealing with the effects of his shitty parenting and I\u2019m in my 30s. At least, find out more before forcing the issue. Talk with your daughters best friends parents maybe- my mom did and I LOVED spending nights or weekends away, especially as an only child. Gentle YTA.", "Try having a discussion with her about the custody arrangements.\n\nI am guessing that the weekend visitation is court ordered which I believe means if you do not send her there can be legal repercussions.  Such as her mother getting even more custody.\n\nAre you able to talk to her mother about the comments and find out how she is when she is there?\n\nIf your Daughter has ADHD are there other options for her on other weekends ie a mentoring program in Australia parents can access the National Disability Insurance Scheme and get support for programs to help with the disability (it is a tough process)  is there something similar where you are?  This might help you get some breaks and her contact with a wider range of people who can help her.\n\nGood luck", "INFO:  Not enough information here\n\nIf this really is nothing more than having to share a room with a sibling and/or Mom forcing the kid to eat their vegetables (or wear a coat when it is cold), then NAH - the Mom has a right to custody and you have the right to a child free weekend.\n\nHowever, the onus is on you to do your homework and to eliminate the possibility that \"bad stuff\" is happening at Mom's house.", "Lol, YTA!! If you needed a childfree weekend then maybe you should have thought about that before having a child with someone else who doesn't want to take care of it either. Sorry dude, you have a kid. You're not entitled to childfree anything anymore and oh well, this is what being a parent is, at the bare minimum. You have custody and your kid doesn't want to go to her mom's but you're thinking about what's best for you and not your daughter. Shitty.", "INFO: Who is she sharing a room with? Girls or boys? Older or younger than her?\n\nKids don\u2019t always know what\u2019s best, of course. Try to sniff out any potential for abuse/bullying/etc. but if you feel confident none of that is happening, keep encouraging her to go even if that seems like you\u2019re \u201cmaking\u201d her.

It can get you im trouble if mom claims parental alienation.\n\nTalk to your ex about her complaints, and I highly suggest family therapy for the 3 of you, or at least for her.

I would suggest figuring out what the real problem is.", "YTA. Your daughter is communicating issues with her and you\u2019re tossing it aside for your own preferences. You need to dig deeper into the root of the issue. Is she being bullied? Neglected? Is there a man in her house that could be hurting her? I hate to be glum but unless you\u2019ve truly investigated the more insidious things that could be happening, you\u2019re not doing due diligence.", "I don't want to scare you but when I was a kid, I was being sexualy abused by a babysitter. I told my parents I didn't like him because he teased me & tried to scare me with bugs. This was true, I'm terrified of bugs, spiders especially & he would yell \"spider!!\" All the time to get me to freak out. I only told my parents about this but he was a trusted friend of the family, a trusted cadet in the youth organization my parents were in & the nephew of our regular daytime babysitter. My parents thought I was overreacting (or they simply dismissed my fears, Idk)\n\nYou need to have a very serious conversation with your kid & perhaps seek guidance from a child therapist. I won't rule either way. I have ADHD & a boy with ADHD so I get it. It's exhausting sometimes. I also have an ex that was abusive to that boy & I have control over access. I've kept the kids away from their father for cause but those excuses are not really the best reason to keep her from a parent. Finding out if there's an underlying reason is key.", "INFO: \n\nWhy did you fight for this much custody?\n\nIf you had to fight so hard to get it, what makes you think mom couldn't care less about having her over?\n\nWhat is the situation at mom's house? Where's the rest of the reasons for your daughter to have to be dragged over there crying, kicking and screaming? \n\nWe all need child free moments. Why can't you get a babysitter? Or have her sleep over at her grandparents every once in a while? Or take a day off when she's in school? That's how the rest of us take some me time.\n\nLook. It's court mandated and without approval of both parties or the court she's going to have to go for now. You can look into letting her choose once she's of the age in your area where she gets to choose in court.\n\nBut to invalidate her feelings like that is insane. You need to take this seriously, figure out fully what is going on that makes her this resistant. You need to address that with her mom to figure out how you both can make time with her easier on your daughter. \nIt's a good think to encourage a relationship with her mom, but this much resistance really needs to be taken seriously and be looked at the roots of it.\n\nI'm not sure I can really make a judgement here without the info questions I asked.", "I can\u2019t believe it took this long to get that answer.
