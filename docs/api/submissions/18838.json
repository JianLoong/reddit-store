If something is moved even an inch or turned even slightly so that the visual we expect isn't the one we see our brain will remove the item from our sight.  The stress it causes a person with ADHD to share a space with someone else is high because there is no way they can avoid touching her stuff when she's only there for a few days a month.  Once something is moved, it's lost to her for a while and causes a great deal of anxiety in most people with ADHD.

So naturally, she doesn't want to go. No kid wants to be forced to spend time with someone they don't really know and who their main parent doesn't like.

Learn to set safe boundaries. My kids know that if I put myself in time out, they need to leave me alone for a bit.

Not even one weekend a month off! And I think that YTA, for not having open dialogue with a 10yo. For not listening to her. For not trying to find a compromise. Even if that were not sleeping there.\n\nWhat you're saying is that you don't want to be around your own child, because your own needs come before hers.

I'm just saying this because it really could be anything that is upsetting your daughter about staying with her Mum.", "YTA. Can't your mum take their child for the weekend? You asked for custody!

There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s crying and begging to not go. I think this is a deeper issue than food and sharing a room. Especially if you fought so hard for custody and she only has visits once a month.

You need to be pretty damn sure that living arrangements and food is REALLY all there is to it.   \nI've had this happen on separate occasions to two cousins of mine. Both turned out that abuse was going on, one was verbal abuse by his mother, he was 7, the other cousin was getting death threats and physical abuse from his stepfather...he was 10. in both cases it had been going on for a while but only when the kids finally broke down and pitched the mother of all fits did their other parents/guardian went to the courts. It took a few conversations with child psychologists to get the kids to spill the truth. and the courts acted accordingly.", "YTA   There's definitely a bigger reason then what your daughter is telling  you.

You don't know what goes on there", "Unless it was decided by court she has to go, which I feel like isn't the case here, YTA. Your mom might be able to watch her for a day or 2 if you need some rest? It's okay to need a few days to yourself, but your daughter's reaction is too extreme to ignore. She is not a toddler in her terrible 2s, she is a 10 year old girl who knows very well what she says. As the reaction is extreme, I would be very allarmed that something more might be going on in that home and I would not take my child there if I don't have to. Try to ask her and talk to her what is going on, you might find out more to work with. And ask someone you and she trust to go to for a day so you can destress. Again, your mom sounds like a great option.", "YTA for the complete lack of concern for your daughters safety/feelings. However without legal reason to withhold visitation I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for having your daughter go because ultimately while I may not agree with it legally she\u2019s required to be there if there isn\u2019t anything bad going on", "NTA IF you made sure that there's nothing going on there.\n\nI have ADHD and being my parents was hard. Also, many ADHD brains refuse to function if you need to work hard or if things are overwhelming or uncomfortable. I think different rules and expectations can set her off. Living and functioning in two different surroundings is much work and effort.  Not wanting to share a room is totally understandable as a reason! But it's not reason enough. Especially people with ADHD have to learn that they have to do things even if they are uncomfortable. How is she doing when she's at her moms? Does she feel okay then, or is she still wanting to go home?\n\nAlso, no judge will keep a child from their parent because the food isn't good...Doesn't matter what we think. \n\nYou should try to find solutions together. Not why she doesn't want to go, but what should change. She doesn't like the food? Well, which food would she like?  It will become more clear how serious her problems are. Does she want only chocolate and fries? Or is she asking for fruit and vegetables?

That she has to share a room or doesn't like the food is not a good reason to cut the contact.\n\nMy daughter went through a phase where she complained to her father about me and complained to me about her father. The three of us had a conversation. And guess what, she thought she had to do this, because she thought she would make us happy with this. No idea how she got this idea, we never talk bad about each other. Certainly not in her presence.\n\nTalk to her calmly. If possible with her mother.

Parents need time to themselves too and with ADHD it can be really tiring. And add on being single. This is something I read about all the time, that we demonize parents who don't do everything for their child and then turn around and say they should take more time for themselves. You can't win. \n\nI don't believe in just giving into everything a child asks for (though I do believe in listening to their concerns pretty closely), and under most circumstances I think it's best to try to foster a relationship with both parents. The court ordered her to go 1x a month for a reason and if OP goes against that it could entail consequences, legal or otherwise. If it really is just that she doesn't like the food or the bedroom sharing, then tough. Esp the food is something that can be worked on. But I would further investigate if there are other reasons she doesn't want to go.\n\nOP, I don't think you're an AH for needing a weekend to yourself, but I would try to see if there's something else more problematic going on at your ex's house that your daughter is having trouble expressing explicitly.", "NTA maybe.

As such I'll put my foot down and tell them they have to come/go. \n\nIn this instance it's up to you to determine the reason for your child's reluctance, which is no doubt exacerbated by her neuro divergency. Once a month isn't really enough to establish routine for a neuro divergent child which is probably why she's doesn't want to go.\n\nIt's not fair to keep her from her mum without a valid reason, also you are entitled to a break once in a while to recharge your batteries to be a better parent when you do have her.", "NAH\n\nI dont know why people think she is being abused by her mom.

Is there anyone else who can help, sleep over with friends?\n\nParents even in a relationship need an occasional time to themselves, you soloing which is hard mode. \n\nMy only concern is how much your daughter doesn't want to go to mums and how it seems like the mum doesn't want her there instead of embracing it. This is a huge red flag.  If you can, turn to others for help even if it's just play dates.  Literally the more I think if you can avoid the mother then do so, if you can get grand parents down and you crash round a friends, do that", "You are NOT THE AH!! I am a single mom to a 10 year old with ADHD too. I went by myself to the Grand Canyon in January. I\u2019m from the east coast. I\u2019ve never been out west. I was flying into Phoenix for a bat mitzvah on the weekend and decided to take a fees before hand to see the GC because I probably would never get the opportunity again. My mom ENCOURAGED me to do it when I was contemplating it. I needed that break. It was three days of peacefulness and relaxation. Just being in my thoughts uninterrupted. My ex never would take my son for even a couple hours and he just recently moved across the state. My babysitting is done all by my parents which I use sparingly because I don\u2019t want them to feel like I\u2019m just using them. So the trip I took was much needed and I was encouraged to do just like I am encouraging you. You\u2019re NTA!! Go enjoy your vacay!\n\nEdit: A word on ADHD. My son refuse to leave the house for any reason. Even if I know and he knows that he\u2019ll have fun there. He\u2019ll come up with excuses, stomp, pout, scream, and yell and throw things. Once we get to said place he tells me every time that he\u2019s excited or had a great time, and I was right. And every time I tell him we\u2019ll maybe we can just leave the house without all the antics since I\u2019m right every time, He says yes, next weekend it\u2019s like last weekend never happened and we\u2019re back to screaming, yelling, pouting about leaving the house. When he\u2019s on meds, this doesn\u2019t happen. But I only gives him meds for school and specific activities. That\u2019s how his meds work, are prescribed, and sanctioned by his doctor. So this is normal ADHD kid behavior. Not liking the food could be food sensory issues, which ND folks tend to have. And not wanting to share a room, I get it. I\u2019m an only child basically too. Sharing rooms is the worst.", "I'm not sure why people are saying 'YTA'. If her only reasons for not wanting to go to her mother's house are that she doesn't like sharing a room or the food is bad, then she needs to learn to get over it and accommodate others.

Anyone who dismisses this is either ignorant about custody or their imagination is running wild about the ex.\n\nMost importantly is the OP\u2019s state of mind.

They have another adult there to lighten the load. They have another adult there that can look after the child while they leave the house. Yes it might not be an entire weekend but it\u2019s definitely child-free time. Being a single parent is hard, especially if the child/children love with you essentially full time. You have to be switched on all of the time! You are absolutely allowed to feel how you\u2019re feeling, it can be exhausting. \n\nIs there a way you can build in child-free time another way?

Can't she go to your mom, a sibling or a friend that you trust ?", "YTA, for multiple reasons. This is a long reply but I'm not sorry, all of it is important. TL;DR at the end.\n\nFor starters, let me rephrase your question, so you can see what it initially sounds like. \"I had a child, that I campaigned to have for the majority of the time, but now I don't want her here because she's too much work.\" Just from that, you'd be the AH.\n\nBut, as a woman with ADHD, the H in it is NOT literal hyperactivity. It shouldn't even be called attention deficit, because we don't have a deficit, we have issues with directing it. Your little girl is active and wants to play, and I can promise you that the time she *WANTS/ASKS* to play with you is limited. Very limited. You might get another year, if you're lucky, where your daughter wants to spend time with you.\n\nAs a woman whose dad didn't want to play or spend time with me, I can tell you that I have up trying. And I gave up early. I was about 7 when I stopped trying to spend time with my dad or get his attention, because I knew, even then that he didn't want to be around me.\n\nI was 7 and I knew my dad didn't want to play with me. Imagine your own daughter, look at her and imagine her saying \"Daddy, I know you don't want me here. I'll go play on my own.\" Imagine knowing that YOU are the reason your daughter won't bother even talking to you soon. And trust me, she *KNOWS* you think she's too much.\n\nOn top of that, girls learn what is acceptable treatment in relationships from their father figures. Hence the expression \"The only man a girl can trust is her daddy.\" From basic psychology and experience, I can tell you what happens when a young girl develops a warped sense of male roles in her life. She goes out of her way, often to her detriment, to appease men in her life, to gain their attention and affection, and she doesn't even realise she's doing it.\n\nShe is slowly learning that she is too much, that she must do as others tell her and that her emotions (which will become harder for her to understand and control in puberty, especially with ADHD) are invalid and unwanted. She will start to struggle to understand them and herself, all the while knowing that her own father, the one who is supposed to love her the most, (because he fought to have almost total custody) doesn't like her.\n\nAnd the crying because she doesn't want to 'share a room' or 'the food sucks'? Yeah, no, that's not a temper tantrum, she is trying to tell you something and she doesn't know exactly how to put it, for whatever reason. You say you know your daughter, but she will feel that you're already pulling away from her, so it's entirely possible she doesn't know how to tell you something is wrong because she already knows you won't listen/don't care. At 10, she knows this. By 12-14, she won't bother telling you anything.\n\nAs far as her being active goes, try to find something she enjoys and do it with her. The ADHD brain lacks the dopamine to control where our attention goes, so we end up hyper-fixated on the wrong thing or hopping from one thing to another. Trust me in this. I wish I'd been diagnosed as a child, instead of age 37, it would have made my life easier and better.\n\nOh, one last thing. The reason I'm writing ALL of this is because I hope anybody reading who is in/has had/is facing the same situations can avoid them. If I can stop ANYBODY from experiencing my childhood or the way I'm stuck now, it's worth it. I wouldn't want anybody to ever feel the way I've felt.\n\nYTA, but you can learn to change it and not be.

Both can be true. \n\nAnd it's possible the parent HAS tried to find out and nothing has turned up. \n\nMaybe we need more info.", "This child is complaining about food not being good.", "the comments are suggesting to not ignore it, not to call the swat team on the ex.", "ok...don't speak on behalf of everyone with adhd either????? lmfao", "You must know much better than the dad. He should call you personally. For everything. You sound enlightened.", "That still doesn\u2019t matter. He would have to go back to court to get full custody. He can\u2019t just stop doing visits unless he has proof of anything wrong being done to daughter.", "Every place is too peoply for me", "Same for me even if there aren\u2019t people there. \ud83d\ude02", "OP said in a comment that the child's mother would most likely not complain because she doesn't really care and was always pretty cold. So she would probably be fine with the kid not going.", "I literally said that to my wife yesterday. Lol", "It\u2019s really hard. The only family we have nearby is my brother in law. My family is 1,000 miles away and the only other person in my husband\u2019s family we\u2019d trust our kids with alone is his 84 year old grandmother who lives a few hours from us for now and has been having some health issues. \n\nMy brother in law happy to babysit but my husband feels bad asking him so we don\u2019t do it often, mostly just for special occasions or if there\u2019s something happening we both need to be at but don\u2019t want or can\u2019t to take the kids. That doesn\u2019t happen often at all though, maybe 2-4 times a year. When my mom comes to visit we take advantage of her being there to go out just the two of us and when we go visit my family once a year we take all the advantage we can because there\u2019s usually always multiple adults at my mom\u2019s house willing to watch our kids. They\u2019re pretty independent now at 4&8 so it\u2019s really just making sure they don\u2019t kill themselves, each other, or burn the house down. \n\nWe visited my family a few weeks ago and got our first overnight trip by ourselves since before our daughter was born. I grew up not far from St. Augustine so we got a room in the historic district and left our kids with my mom. My daughter turns 5 next month but didn\u2019t start sleeping through the night until after she turned 4 and we consulted a specialist so we never left them with anyone because we didn\u2019t want anyone else\u2019s sleep to be disrupted by her. \n\nWe\u2019re also really strict with their bedtimes so we usually get like 3 hours of kids free time every night after they go to bed. My husband and I tag each other out when we need or want a break and we each have our kid free hobbies we like to do as well. It\u2019s still tough because we don\u2019t get to do our couple hobbies without our kids but those hobbies are also good for kids so we are raising them to enjoy those things too. It\u2019s definitely getting easier as they get older but it\u2019s still tough doing it by ourselves 95% of the time.", "Well since he is not saying anything except he has full custody, his daughter doesn\u2019t want to visit her mother and her mother doesn\u2019t care if she visits I have to make my own assumptions", "It does matter", "You actually don't. You take the information you have and conclude based on that. You don't insert your made-up storyline into someone else's life and then decide based on your fallacy.", "No it doesn't.  He could stop sending her, and then the mom decides she's pissed at him a few months later and wants to make trouble and then he's facing contempt of court.", "My husband thinks me & the kids are ridiculous for using tea spoons for desserts, he's obviously the ridiculous one"]}
