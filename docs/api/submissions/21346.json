The previous times we went we always rented an apartment.\n\nI turn 40 next year and I've always said I don't want a big fuss for it. The one thing I've always said though, is that I'd like to go to Primavera. Our kids are old enough now that they can stay with my mother or sister for a weekend - they all love each other big time, they both spoil the kids whenever they stay with them and the kids love going, so that's not an issue.\n\nA couple of years ago one friend mentioned wanting to go to Primavera for his 40th and i loved the idea, so since then it's the only thing I've said I wanted to do.\n\nToday my wife asked me what I want for my birthday next year and I again said no fuss. She mentioned primavera, and I said yes.\n\nShe then tells me that she won't be going, that she's outgrown it and has no interest. I told her I was disappointed, that she's my wife and the only person I'd want to celebrate my 40th with. She repeated her disinterest in the festival and said she'd \"hold me back\".\n\nLater she noticed I was quiet and asked if I was annoyed with her, I said I was because she has basically told me she doesn't want to spend my 40th celebration with me.

I appreciate that what I want to do with just us isn't a minor thing, I just wanted something semi-casual together, a weekend of beers and music. The festival is an urban one, so no mud involved and back to an apartment at the end of the night.\n\nEdit 2: the friend who had the same idea is older than me, his 40th has been and gone.

But a multi-day music festival, even if it were in your backyard, is what most people would count as a \"big fuss.\" I know you'd like to spend your 40th with your wife, but do you really want to drag her somewhere she would quickly get tired of?", "NAH. You can be disappointed but you can\u2019t force her.  She doesn\u2019t want to go.  It\u2019s not like sitting through a baseball game or concert.  It\u2019s an all day festival.  It\u2019s a lot to ask an uninterested person.  Take a friend and do something else with your wife.\n\nEven if she goes with you, she\u2019s not gonna be happy and having a great time.", "NAH. I'm definitely not as into festivals as I once was, so I can understand your wife's position. Also, if a trip is involved in celebrating your birthday, even a milestone birthday, I'd say that qualifies as a fuss.", "INFO: How is a multi-day music festival that would require travel and overnight lodging not \u201ca big fuss\u201d for your birthday?  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unreasonable to want to go, but own the fact that you do want a big fuss for your birthday instead of downplaying what you\u2019re asking for.", "NAH\n\nGo and enjoy yourself. Why would you want someone there who didn't want to be there? Maybe loud music and people drinking/drunks is no longer a fun past-time for her -  probably more like a headache.", "NTA. Me and husband went to a lot of festivals and such back in the day. We both passed 40 by now, and havent been to one for over 10 years, but if he would want to go to a festival for his birthday, id suck it up and join him, because i love him.\nBonuspoints for a festival where we wouldnt have to sleep in a tent!!", "NTA. We sometimes do things that aren't our style for the ones we love. I found it insulting that she said she 'outgrew' this. She doesn't want to go and indirectly calls you immature. That's gotta hurt.", "NTA   \n\nSometimes the best gift you can give someone is the opportunity to do something they really enjoy with others who enjoy it just as much. (Kind of like my husband\u2019s wilderness fishing trips with his college buddies.) \n\nSo she might be giving you the opp to go but with friends instead. Not everyone enjoys multiday festivals: there\u2019s crowds, lines, heat, rain, mud, lots of standing, overpriced food, gross portapotties, etc so she might be willing to give the event a miss this time around. \n\nIf you want to spend the day with her, is there a compromise activity that would work - another (shorter) concert or event? Can she come for a couple of artists and then go?", "NAH\n\nBut I think you can find a middle ground going to Barcelona together and you spend more time in concerts while she shops ir reads. You two will still have time during the day together", "NTA and it\u2019s weird that your wife would bring up the festival and when you say yes, she then says she wouldn\u2019t be going and to celebrate your birthday without her. I don\u2019t know what to make of that. Sorry your wife is being a stick in the mud.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can't suck up not liking an event for your own birthday? Why did she even suggest the idea if she didn't even want to go.", "NAH \n\nI can see how you are disappointed about her not joining since she is the person that you want to go to the festival with, but I can also see how she really probably does feel she\u2019s doing you a favor if she does feel that she\u2019s outgrown it and my hold you back if she\u2019s just not into all of the walking around and crowds, etc. then you might actually feel more bummed or lonely with her there if she doesn\u2019t want to participate in the same way you do. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s just flat out saying that she doesn\u2019t want to go because it\u2019s not her cup of tea, which would be pretty rude since it is your birthday, but it sounds like she\u2019s considering you in the process and thinking that she sees herself bringing you down and doesn\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nMaybe try to keep an open discussion about it between now and when it gets closer.", "NTA.  It sounds like this has been something you've been mentioning for years, and only now is your wife saying it's not for her... You don't suddenly grow out of this sort of thing.  It happens gradually.  Kinda feels like she was stringing you along, hoping you'd lose interest as well.", "NTA, 40 is a major birthday. Your wife actually suggested it and now is backing out... I'd be annoyed too, it's kind of a jerk move on her part.", "NTA", "NAH, if she doesn't want to go she's definitely not going to enhance your experience by being there with you. Just go with a friend and enjoy yourself, you can tell her all about it when you get home.", "NTA and I think saying she's \"grown out of it\" is actually a shitty thing to say and trying to undermine what you want to do.", "YTA \u2026 I mean, if she can take her own car and leave when she\u2019s had enough that\u2019s one thing. Not many people are into big crowds of drunk people listening to music being blasted that you can\u2019t stand or don\u2019t like. \n\nAt least she\u2019s letting you know now vs going and having an attitude about it.", "Maybe you needed to rephrase it earlier on that you wanted to go *with her*. Sow the seed early so she was mentally a little more prepared for it. Kinda ESH because you shouldn\u2019t expect her to go if she doesn\u2019t want to (why not go with your friend and have a great time), but it sounds like you clarified that this was meant to be a special thing with her for your 40th so I would\u2019ve thought she would at least say she\u2019ll think about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife will not make an effort to give you a good birthday. She won't stir her stumps and make a compromise (e.g. she attends Saturday and sits out Sunday). It's pretty sad and pathetic. You should make an effort for your loved ones, even if it doesn't look like something you'd like. I will assume for the purposes of this answer that you would do this for her if the roles were reversed (i.e. if she wanted to attend a dachshund convention when you loathe small dogs).\n\nI mean this isn't a dealbreaker, clearly part of the reason she doesn't want to go is because she realises that she would be a massive Debbie Downer, sulking around the place if she went. But that doesn't make it any more palatable. This needs more talk, discussion and you being honest about how devalued and deprioritised you feel about her treating your birthday as a time about herself.\n\nETA: I feel like a lot of the commenters don't understand the vibe of this festival. If you are picturing Burning Man, you're wrong. This is such an enjoyable festival, and one where it would be perfectly feasible to attend very little music at all and probably still have a good time", "YTA. Go to your concert. Have fun.

And don't say you'd do the same for her. It's a bit cruel. You shouldn't have to manipulate her and put her down by measuring how much more love you have for her.", "Gonna go with NAH.  I used to go to A LOT of music festivals when I was younger, absolutely loved it.  But now that I'm getting older the idea of multiple days of music in the hot ass sun just doesn't sound that appealing.  No hate on the activity, just not something I'm interested in anymore.  I imagine that's how she feels now.\n\nI think it sounds like a great 40th and you should go and have fun even if she's not interested.  Sounds like she doesn't care if that's how you want to spend your 40th.  In the end, how important are birthdays really?  You could still do something to celebrate with just you and her before or after.", "NAH. I would never subject someone I love to 3 days of doing something they hated.

But yes, you would be an AH if you try to guilt her into going.  This isn\u2019t asking her to go out to dinner at some place she doesn\u2019t like or even a concert of some musician she dislikes - you are asking her to spend a whole weekend doing something she has no interest in and that, quite frankly, takes a lot of energy to get through.", "I'd be more concerned she didn't say, \"I am really not up for two days of a festival right now.

She's not telling YOU not to go, you just don't have anyone else you want to go with. And ftr, the fest IS a big fuss. It's a huge time and energy obligation. \n\nLook around your friend/family group and see if someone wants to go with you. But don't be salty at your wife who's a mother now who doesn't have the same energy she had 16 years ago to want to go do things you guys did in your mid 20s. This is something fun for you. This is an obligation to her, and she's not willing to invest in it. That doesn't mean she doesn't love you or that you don't matter.

I do NOT see this as your wife not wanting to celebrate your 40th with you. That is very different. She just doesn\u2019t want to do this one specific thing. And it is a specific thing. An immersive experience and the kind of thing that is either amazing or horrible depending if you feel like being there. I have a hard time understanding why you\u2019d want to ring in your 40th with her, doing something you know she doesn\u2019t want to do.

Plus as you age your hearing and ability to listen to music being blasted by huge speakers decreases.

It's not like you're asking her to join you on a submersible to view the Titanic or go cave diving in Thailand.", "NAH. Could you compromise? Mini-break in Barcelona or Madrid, do one day of the festival? You spend some time as a couple and some time apar\n\nOr ask around your friends and see if anyone else (another couple?) might be up for a part holiday/part festival break.", "NAH - She could travel to Barcelona with you, you go to the festival and meet up with her at different times during the day NOT at the festival.\n\nAnother option is you traveling solo. Solo trips are an opportunity for a lot of introspection and internal growth.

I can understand why you would be bummed that she didn\u2019t want to go with you to a festival that you previously had so much fun at- and thinking back to those times probably brings back good memories. However, I know that there are some things I can\u2019t do anymore now that I\u2019m 40\u2026 like drinking alcohol out of a vase, or pulling an all-nighter and still function the next day, OR going to a music festival for 3 days in a different country that will wipe me out physically and mentally. That wouldn\u2019t be much of a vacation for me at this age- especially to have to come back and take care of my kids. OP- can you maybe compromise and do 1 day of the festival or a couple evenings seeing headliners and the rest of the day doing other activities or just relaxing at the beach in Barcelona?", "NTA.  First off I think her comment that \"she's outgrown it and has no interest\" is rude and dismissive.  I would be hurt by it.  It's your birthday it's not like you randomly announced that you wanted to go.  If that was the case I would understand her not wanting to go and would be OK with that.  It's your birthday and she doesn't want you to be happy?  There is no reason she should not go with you.  She is selfish.  She is TA.  I'm sorry she is doing this to you.  Despite this I hope you have a Happy 40th Birthday", "Your wife has already given you a big gift, and that\u2019s telling you you\u2019ll have more fun without her at this event. My partner and I had very similar interests as 20 somethings. Now in our 40\u2019s we\u2019ve both grown out of various things. Would I attend a McFly concert with her? No. Would she come camping for a weekend with me? No. But that\u2019s what we both did for our 40th birthdays, with other friends. The night before we had a little thing the celebrate the last of our 30\u2019s that worked for both of us (cream tea at a hotel for her, movie and Chinese food for me), wished each other a happy birthday, and then\u2026.this is the important bit\u2026.enjoyed ourselves. \n\nOP, no one has to be the asshole here. If I had to go to McFly I would have ruined the evening by not being able to fake enjoying it for that long. My partner would have complained the entire camping trip. Compromise. It\u2019s either you do something you\u2019ll both enjoy or know that your wife is miserable at your birthday and sucking it up for you. I know which one I\u2019d pick.", "I'm almost your age and I've outgrown music festivals too. All that walking, all that standing, having to wear earplugs, no thanks.

You're clearly the emotionally sensitive one in the relationship, that's relatable to me, although I'm a bit more stoic about this type of situation, I'll explain.\n\nI'm also very sentimental, and for me while I would be sad that my partner wouldn't go, the nuance of the reason would make the difference. If she doesn't like them, and she wouldn't enjoy it, it wouldn't be enjoyable to you to drag her along. \n\nShe phrased her objection in a very logical and stoic way geared towards setting a boundary, while trying to spare your feelings and point out that she wouldn't be able to give you a good time.\n\nBut, the good news is that its perfectly okay to be disappointed. \n\nWhen I was with an ex, she got freaked out very much so by any sort of fighting, and since I like to train mma, I wouldn't ever have tried to ask her to come to a violent aspect of it like an event, unless she wanted to go. \n\nIf I had a birthday event that I wanted her to be at, and someone offered me an mma event, id have chosen to do something else and be with her, but that's just me because I'm very picky, so I always want to be around someone if they're rare enough for me to love. \n\nI hope that all makes sense in my rambling late night fashion. I don't think either of you did anything wrong, or even felt anything wrong.", "NAH but I may be biased because festivals are the stuff of nightmares to me. (I get anxious in crowds, loud music gives me headaches and standing around without moving makes my feet swell.)\n\nI feel like all in all it's a big ask, but it's not absurd. So I feel like you are okay to expect her to go. And I feel like it's okay for her not to want to go.\n\nMaybe talk a bit more and see if you can figure out what exactly she's wanting to avoid of the whole ordeal, and if there's a possible compromise that will make it easier for her to go with you.", "NTA.

I'd go to a festival or short trip I didn't prefer and put on a happy face for my spouse. It's not that hard to do", "NTA. There's always some give and take in a relationship, for a big birthday like a 40th, I think it's normal to suck it up and do something you might not love doing if it's what would make your partner truly happy.

She should be able to sacrifice for the man she loves, it's just one day.\nThat's how love works, sacrifices and compromises.", "NTA. Dude, it sounds like you both have differing interests. Nothing wrong with that unless one party lays on the guilt. From your summary it sounds like your wife is actually being cool about your enthusiasm.

It sounds like part of the reason her saying she's too old for it is the implication that by extension you are too and that you shouldn't go or even want to either. Or maybe that's just me and I'm reading too much into this. Either way I'd go because that's the kind of thing I'd look back at and be resentful if I let myself get talked out of doing", "NAH!\n\nI am going to a festival (Mad Cool in Madrid) as part of my birthday this week, and my boyfriend isn't coming, and it's fine.

Which I totally understand. I can't tell you the amount of times I've dragged family members to conventions and movies and stuff - that they're not into - for my birthday. The sheer difference between my excitement and their apathy really killed the mood.

You say you've been before, so your wife knows the format of Primavera. Although there may not be any mud, it does involve standing on concrete for hours on end, and that can take its toll. The main headliners aren't on until 2am and some acts go on at 4am. You definitely need to be really into the music to enjoy it, its not like other festivals with loads of other stuff going on.\n\n It's an endurance test for sure. I say that as someone fitter than average in their mid 40s (without the added stress of parenting) who lives in BCN and have been for the last 7 years, it's getting more difficult for sure.

Your wife has been honest that she really would not enjoy this huge event and feels it would hamper your good time (it would).  It does not mean she does not want to celebrate your birthday. Seems to me she is offering the trip as a gift to you just not with her. You could plan a different weekend get away if what you really want is a trip with her.

You should consider that your wife is most likely trying to improve your experience at the festival.\n\nIf her presence is more important than the festival, then my suggestion is to pick an activity you both would enjoy.

Just because they had the money before and she wanted to go before doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a reasonable ask for her to go now if she doesn\u2019t want to.", "I agree that they shouldn't go if they really don't want to.  But I can also understand being really disappointed if they USED to like going and now they don't, and you'd been looking forward to going with them.  That's a bummer", "I can understand. It was scary because a rabid dog is a very real possibility. An indestructible psycho killer drowned boy who manages to come back from the dead and becomes a mountain with a disfigured face is not (yet).", "Friends with benefits basically", "We really don't know if she would be miserable or not. Just because she went to them in the past doesn't mean much either. She may not have liked them that much back then but only went because the husband liked them. I used to go to a bunch of concerts just cause my friend liked them but I definitely started to tire of them too."]}
