The one thing I've always said though, is that I'd like to go to Primavera. Our kids are old enough now that they can stay with my mother or sister for a weekend - they all love each other big time, they both spoil the kids whenever they stay with them and the kids love going, so that's not an issue.\n\nA couple of years ago one friend mentioned wanting to go to Primavera for his 40th and i loved the idea, so since then it's the only thing I've said I wanted to do.\n\nToday my wife asked me what I want for my birthday next year and I again said no fuss. She mentioned primavera, and I said yes.\n\nShe then tells me that she won't be going, that she's outgrown it and has no interest. I told her I was disappointed, that she's my wife and the only person I'd want to celebrate my 40th with. She repeated her disinterest in the festival and said she'd \"hold me back\".\n\nLater she noticed I was quiet and asked if I was annoyed with her, I said I was because she has basically told me she doesn't want to spend my 40th celebration with me.

I appreciate that what I want to do with just us isn't a minor thing, I just wanted something semi-casual together, a weekend of beers and music. The festival is an urban one, so no mud involved and back to an apartment at the end of the night.\n\nEdit 2: the friend who had the same idea is older than me, his 40th has been and gone.

But a multi-day music festival, even if it were in your backyard, is what most people would count as a \"big fuss.\" I know you'd like to spend your 40th with your wife, but do you really want to drag her somewhere she would quickly get tired of?", "NAH. You can be disappointed but you can\u2019t force her.  She doesn\u2019t want to go.  It\u2019s not like sitting through a baseball game or concert.  It\u2019s an all day festival.  It\u2019s a lot to ask an uninterested person.  Take a friend and do something else with your wife.\n\nEven if she goes with you, she\u2019s not gonna be happy and having a great time.", "NAH. I'm definitely not as into festivals as I once was, so I can understand your wife's position. Also, if a trip is involved in celebrating your birthday, even a milestone birthday, I'd say that qualifies as a fuss.", "INFO: How is a multi-day music festival that would require travel and overnight lodging not \u201ca big fuss\u201d for your birthday?  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unreasonable to want to go, but own the fact that you do want a big fuss for your birthday instead of downplaying what you\u2019re asking for.", "NAH\n\nGo and enjoy yourself. Why would you want someone there who didn't want to be there? Maybe loud music and people drinking/drunks is no longer a fun past-time for her -  probably more like a headache.", "NTA. Me and husband went to a lot of festivals and such back in the day. We both passed 40 by now, and havent been to one for over 10 years, but if he would want to go to a festival for his birthday, id suck it up and join him, because i love him.\nBonuspoints for a festival where we wouldnt have to sleep in a tent!!", "NTA. We sometimes do things that aren't our style for the ones we love. I found it insulting that she said she 'outgrew' this. She doesn't want to go and indirectly calls you immature. That's gotta hurt.", "NTA   \n\nSometimes the best gift you can give someone is the opportunity to do something they really enjoy with others who enjoy it just as much. (Kind of like my husband\u2019s wilderness fishing trips with his college buddies.) \n\nSo she might be giving you the opp to go but with friends instead. Not everyone enjoys multiday festivals: there\u2019s crowds, lines, heat, rain, mud, lots of standing, overpriced food, gross portapotties, etc so she might be willing to give the event a miss this time around. \n\nIf you want to spend the day with her, is there a compromise activity that would work - another (shorter) concert or event? Can she come for a couple of artists and then go?", "NAH\n\nBut I think you can find a middle ground going to Barcelona together and you spend more time in concerts while she shops ir reads. You two will still have time during the day together", "NTA and it\u2019s weird that your wife would bring up the festival and when you say yes, she then says she wouldn\u2019t be going and to celebrate your birthday without her. I don\u2019t know what to make of that. Sorry your wife is being a stick in the mud.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can't suck up not liking an event for your own birthday? Why did she even suggest the idea if she didn't even want to go.", "NAH \n\nI can see how you are disappointed about her not joining since she is the person that you want to go to the festival with, but I can also see how she really probably does feel she\u2019s doing you a favor if she does feel that she\u2019s outgrown it and my hold you back if she\u2019s just not into all of the walking around and crowds, etc. then you might actually feel more bummed or lonely with her there if she doesn\u2019t want to participate in the same way you do. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s just flat out saying that she doesn\u2019t want to go because it\u2019s not her cup of tea, which would be pretty rude since it is your birthday, but it sounds like she\u2019s considering you in the process and thinking that she sees herself bringing you down and doesn\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nMaybe try to keep an open discussion about it between now and when it gets closer.", "NTA.  It sounds like this has been something you've been mentioning for years, and only now is your wife saying it's not for her... You don't suddenly grow out of this sort of thing.  It happens gradually.  Kinda feels like she was stringing you along, hoping you'd lose interest as well.", "NTA, 40 is a major birthday. Your wife actually suggested it and now is backing out... I'd be annoyed too, it's kind of a jerk move on her part.", "NTA", "NAH, if she doesn't want to go she's definitely not going to enhance your experience by being there with you. Just go with a friend and enjoy yourself, you can tell her all about it when you get home.", "NTA and I think saying she's \"grown out of it\" is actually a shitty thing to say and trying to undermine what you want to do.", "YTA \u2026 I mean, if she can take her own car and leave when she\u2019s had enough that\u2019s one thing. Not many people are into big crowds of drunk people listening to music being blasted that you can\u2019t stand or don\u2019t like. \n\nAt least she\u2019s letting you know now vs going and having an attitude about it.", "Maybe you needed to rephrase it earlier on that you wanted to go *with her*. Sow the seed early so she was mentally a little more prepared for it. Kinda ESH because you shouldn\u2019t expect her to go if she doesn\u2019t want to (why not go with your friend and have a great time), but it sounds like you clarified that this was meant to be a special thing with her for your 40th so I would\u2019ve thought she would at least say she\u2019ll think about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife will not make an effort to give you a good birthday. She won't stir her stumps and make a compromise (e.g. she attends Saturday and sits out Sunday). It's pretty sad and pathetic. You should make an effort for your loved ones, even if it doesn't look like something you'd like. I will assume for the purposes of this answer that you would do this for her if the roles were reversed (i.e. if she wanted to attend a dachshund convention when you loathe small dogs).\n\nI mean this isn't a dealbreaker, clearly part of the reason she doesn't want to go is because she realises that she would be a massive Debbie Downer, sulking around the place if she went. But that doesn't make it any more palatable. This needs more talk, discussion and you being honest about how devalued and deprioritised you feel about her treating your birthday as a time about herself.\n\nETA: I feel like a lot of the commenters don't understand the vibe of this festival. If you are picturing Burning Man, you're wrong. This is such an enjoyable festival, and one where it would be perfectly feasible to attend very little music at all and probably still have a good time", "YTA. Go to your concert. Have fun.

And don't say you'd do the same for her. It's a bit cruel. You shouldn't have to manipulate her and put her down by measuring how much more love you have for her.", "Gonna go with NAH.  I used to go to A LOT of music festivals when I was younger, absolutely loved it.  But now that I'm getting older the idea of multiple days of music in the hot ass sun just doesn't sound that appealing.  No hate on the activity, just not something I'm interested in anymore.  I imagine that's how she feels now.\n\nI think it sounds like a great 40th and you should go and have fun even if she's not interested.  Sounds like she doesn't care if that's how you want to spend your 40th.  In the end, how important are birthdays really?  You could still do something to celebrate with just you and her before or after.", "NAH. I would never subject someone I love to 3 days of doing something they hated.

But yes, you would be an AH if you try to guilt her into going.  This isn\u2019t asking her to go out to dinner at some place she doesn\u2019t like or even a concert of some musician she dislikes - you are asking her to spend a whole weekend doing something she has no interest in and that, quite frankly, takes a lot of energy to get through.", "I'd be more concerned she didn't say, \"I am really not up for two days of a festival right now.

She's not telling YOU not to go, you just don't have anyone else you want to go with. And ftr, the fest IS a big fuss. It's a huge time and energy obligation. \n\nLook around your friend/family group and see if someone wants to go with you. But don't be salty at your wife who's a mother now who doesn't have the same energy she had 16 years ago to want to go do things you guys did in your mid 20s. This is something fun for you. This is an obligation to her, and she's not willing to invest in it. That doesn't mean she doesn't love you or that you don't matter.

I do NOT see this as your wife not wanting to celebrate your 40th with you. That is very different. She just doesn\u2019t want to do this one specific thing. And it is a specific thing. An immersive experience and the kind of thing that is either amazing or horrible depending if you feel like being there. I have a hard time understanding why you\u2019d want to ring in your 40th with her, doing something you know she doesn\u2019t want to do.

Plus as you age your hearing and ability to listen to music being blasted by huge speakers decreases.

The bathroom situation make my skin crawl. \n\nBut for my husbands milestone birthday, I\u2019d suck it up, put on a huge smile and enjoy seeing him get to do the ONE thing he asked for his birthday.   And in the end, we would have created a great memory together.", "NTA. I'm an extrovert. I like to travel and have adventures. My husband is an introvert who is always cautious. The eternal boy scout. We have been happily married for over 20 years. There are trips I take with my best friend, my travel buddy. Her and I go hiking, beer tasting, and to concerts, stuff that my husband isn't interested it. However, every year my hubby and I take a trip together for our anniversary. He puts up with my constant conversations with strangers, finding adventurers, and general silliness. He says he enjoys seeing me happy. This is something that you have been looking forward to. If it was my hubby, he might make a few light-hearted jokes about going kicking and screaming, but he would go. He would probably even pretend to look forward to it. But most of all, he'd enjoy seeing me happy.", "NTA sometimes we endure things we don\u2019t 100% enjoy (that don\u2019t bring physical or emotional harm) for the people we love", "NTA I personally do agree with you that she could join you for your birthday. You do these things to show your partner that you care even if it's something you don't always want to do.", "NAH, I\u2019d do why ever my partner wanted to do. That\u2019s part of being in a relationship sacrifices are made. I\u2019m this case she should suck it up and do what makes her husband happy for his bday", "So reading this, you have a birthday trip planned but nobody is going with you? That sucks. I\u2019m sorry. \n\nNTA for being annoyed at all. What\u2019s worse, if it were me, I don\u2019t know that I would want her to go now. I wouldn\u2019t want someone there after they made it clear they didn\u2019t want to be there with you. Maybe that\u2019s me. \n\nInvite someone else if you can. Try to enjoy. \n\nDid she give a reason besides not being into it?", "As a mom of multiple littles, I have to say that going to a music festival is just about the last thing I\u2019d want to do. I loved music festivals in my 20s. With younger kids, though, it\u2019s constant chaos and sensory overstimulation (crying, fighting, happy squealing), it\u2019s messy, and it\u2019s the opposite of peaceful. To go to a highly stimulating environment like a music festival would probably fry the last few neurons I have left. \n\nNAH.", "Yta and you sound like a big baby pouting that she \"basically\" said she doesn't want to spend your birthday with you when that's not at all what she said or meant. She doesn't want to go to a music festival, she'll still celebrate your birthday.", "How white and privileged are you? I mean NAH, but a multi day festival in another country is \"a fuss.\" Sweaty, crowded, dirty, young, loud, obnoxiously drunk, high, horny strangers...from all over the world packed into a tiny place. Sounds awesome/s...\nYour thing isn't your wife's thing. Should she be MISERABLE for days to entertain your mid-life crisis? She is saying...go...spend exorbitant amounts of money on some frivolous party where your back and knees will kill you after 1/2 day on day one. Where someone will probably puke on your shoes and the people next door in your Airbnb are having a great time on mushrooms and an orgy. Go...with her blessings. \nBut, for the love of all things holy just let her have her murder podcast and skincare routine. She sounds awesome. I am sure someone at the gym or pickleball or golf has always wanted to go to this thing...someone just got divorced and needs some excitement. \nYou are a grown ass man. You don't need someone else to go and validate your interests. Go solo. You are going to a place where LITERALLY THOUSANDS of people like the same things as you. \nWhatever you decide this is a lesson. She's not your mom. She doesn't owe you anything. She has autonomy. Get over yourself. And happy birthday.", "I am in my early 40's, my husband is 50. He wanted to attend a weekend music fest this year and I sucked it up and went, it wasn't enjoyable at all. I dreaded every morning and was miserable the whole day. Please do not do this to your spouse. When I was in my late 20's and early 30's a weekend long fest was fun, it isn't anymore. NAH in this situation.", "ESH. Your wife has clearly known that she is over music festivals for awhile and should have told you that years ago rather than hoping to run out your clock and then disappointing you. \n\nYour emphasis on not raising a fuss is about not having the attention on you and still places the burden on your wife, which means that you have outsourced the fuss. A quiet dinner or a casual party at home would be WAY less fuss overall because it would involve way less work for your wife and would make the whole event super casual, but that fuss would still draw attention to you. Primavera diminishes the focus on you but greatly increases the burden on your wife. It\u2019s not really a reasonable request, even for a milestone birthday, which is why your wife should have been upfront about this situation years ago rather than attempting to run out the clock.", "Soft YTA listen I understand that it\u2019s something you like and it\u2019s your birthday, but forcing someone to do something they already expressed they don\u2019t want to do is just going to ruin the day.", "Your wife said she would not enjoy going to this festival, so would it really be that fun to go to it with her? I used to go to jazz concerts with my husband for years, and although I love him and I tried to be open-minded about it, I have rarely felt anything but boredom and a desire for the sound to stop. I can understand why people enjoy jazz, but I just don't.", "You're NTA, but maybe YBA (You Be Alone). Rock on, birthday dude! \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd18", "NAH. I used to go to festivals all the time. I'm 38 and in the past few years, I have realized that I just *can't* any longer. My body doesn't like it. My mind doesn't like it. It is no longer my idea of a good time. If you want to do it, great. But your wife? Why would you want to make your wife miserable for your birthday?", "Nah go with your friend who wants to go and have a nice dinner when you get home.", "Ideally she would go with you, but I also can\u2019t be too harsh on her since I\u2019d rather be shot than go to a music festival.", "He seems to have made it very clear that this is the one and only thing he wants to do for his birthday.  He decided this was what he wanted to do a couple of years ago and nothing else will do.", "A music festival isn't a \"sacrifice\". She doesn't want to go, simple as that. Either go with other people or find an activity that makes both parties happy - that's how a healthy relationship would work it out.", "I cant believe this reasonable comment is getting downvoted", "Yeah, to make your partner happy on a milestone bday.", "Its his birthday they should do what he wants? I don't know how music festivals work but could she go for one day? Again I don't know how they work", "This is correct.\n\nOP is YTA. Lots of people would love to go to Barcelona. Take one of them. Or go alone. Don't drag someone to a music festival that doesn't want to go. I wouldn't go either.\n\nDo something special with your wife before or after the Barcelona trip that you'll both love.", "It wouldn't be very fun for wife but it still isn't a big fuss", "Happy cake day!!", "> Its his birthday they should do what he wants?\n\nWithin reason. Pick something that you know your partner will enjoy, why expect them to be miserable to satisfy your wants? That's selfish.", "A few days of spending most of the day at a crowded event that OP's wife wouldn't be enjoying is probably more than just a little bit of discomfort. Even if his wife eventually agrees to go, OP would always be reminded by the fact that she's not having a good time like he is. That beats the purpose of celebrating and having fun together don't you think?", "Doing something you don't want to do but doing it anyway is definition of \"sucking it up.\". Is it not?   So the wife going to a festival she isn't interested in visiting is sucking it up.  \n\nI happily suck it up for friends and family all the time because I love putting a smile on people's faces and helping them feel loved and supported....  But make no mistake, I'm definitely sucking it up and have no desire to see to this random ass play my grandmother wants to see.\nAnd I have no desire to watch 7 year olds attempt to play sports but I was there for my little brother.", "> Shouldn't you enjoy seeing your SO having a great time? Shouldn't that excitement rub off on you? \n\nClearly the wife doesn't feel this way since she expressed her disinterest. That's all she should have needed to say. Why is that so hard to understand? OP should be mature enough at 40 to accept this and designate a different activity for them.", "Sorry, there's a limit to that. You have to balance wanting your SO to be happy with your own needs. And that goes both ways -- he shouldn't be forcing her into something she doesn't want. A festival is a big commitment that would be draining and exhausting if you didn't want to be there. If he was asking for a day of it, that would be one thing, but a whole festival is not something you can expect someone to do for you/something you can guilt them over not doing.", "I don\u2019t think you are the asshole. \n\nYour wife should be willing to take one for the team every so often. Especially if it isn\u2019t a crazy festival and something she used to do before.\n\nYou are on Reddit so expect most on here to say she\u2019s right. As most on Reddit seem to be very self centred and only think of themselves", "A horror convention is mostly sweaty crowds & art booths. It\u2019s about as horror as shopping at a market."]}
