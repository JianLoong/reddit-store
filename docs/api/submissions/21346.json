We've been together for nearly 16 years. We went to a good few music festivals together over the years before we had kids, including a couple of visits to Barcelona for Primavera Sound. For those unfamiliar with it, it's a festival held in the city of Barcelona itself - no camping, just hotel/airbnb for the weekend. The previous times we went we always rented an apartment.\n\nI turn 40 next year and I've always said I don't want a big fuss for it. The one thing I've always said though, is that I'd like to go to Primavera. Our kids are old enough now that they can stay with my mother or sister for a weekend - they all love each other big time, they both spoil the kids whenever they stay with them and the kids love going, so that's not an issue.\n\nA couple of years ago one friend mentioned wanting to go to Primavera for his 40th and i loved the idea, so since then it's the only thing I've said I wanted to do.\n\nToday my wife asked me what I want for my birthday next year and I again said no fuss. She mentioned primavera, and I said yes.\n\nShe then tells me that she won't be going, that she's outgrown it and has no interest. I told her I was disappointed, that she's my wife and the only person I'd want to celebrate my 40th with. She repeated her disinterest in the festival and said she'd \"hold me back\".\n\nLater she noticed I was quiet and asked if I was annoyed with her, I said I was because she has basically told me she doesn't want to spend my 40th celebration with me. AITA for expecting her to want to come? It's not as if I drag her along to these things all the time, it's a one off for my 40th.\n\nTl;dr want to go to a festival for my 40th birthday, wife says she doesn't want to come.\n\nEDIT: So to be clear, when I say I don't want \"a big fuss\" I mean I don't want a huge party or big deal with family and friends, I just wanted something for the two of us. I appreciate that what I want to do with just us isn't a minor thing, I just wanted something semi-casual together, a weekend of beers and music. The festival is an urban one, so no mud involved and back to an apartment at the end of the night.\n\nEdit 2: the friend who had the same idea is older than me, his 40th has been and gone. As far as I'm aware he's not planning on going next year. I literally don't know of anyone who is going to this festival next year.", "created_utc": 1688497578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qnyvl/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_wife_doesnt_want/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But a multi-day music festival, even if it were in your backyard, is what most people would count as a \"big fuss.\" I know you'd like to spend your 40th with your wife, but do you really want to drag her somewhere she would quickly get tired of?", "NAH. You can be disappointed but you can\u2019t force her.  She doesn\u2019t want to go.  It\u2019s not like sitting through a baseball game or concert.  It\u2019s an all day festival.  It\u2019s a lot to ask an uninterested person.  Take a friend and do something else with your wife.\n\nEven if she goes with you, she\u2019s not gonna be happy and having a great time.", "NAH. I'm definitely not as into festivals as I once was, so I can understand your wife's position. Also, if a trip is involved in celebrating your birthday, even a milestone birthday, I'd say that qualifies as a fuss.", "INFO: How is a multi-day music festival that would require travel and overnight lodging not \u201ca big fuss\u201d for your birthday?  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unreasonable to want to go, but own the fact that you do want a big fuss for your birthday instead of downplaying what you\u2019re asking for.", "NAH\n\nGo and enjoy yourself. Why would you want someone there who didn't want to be there? Maybe loud music and people drinking/drunks is no longer a fun past-time for her -  probably more like a headache.", "NTA. Me and husband went to a lot of festivals and such back in the day. We both passed 40 by now, and havent been to one for over 10 years, but if he would want to go to a festival for his birthday, id suck it up and join him, because i love him.\nBonuspoints for a festival where we wouldnt have to sleep in a tent!!", "NTA. We sometimes do things that aren't our style for the ones we love. I found it insulting that she said she 'outgrew' this. She doesn't want to go and indirectly calls you immature. That's gotta hurt.", "NTA   \n\nSometimes the best gift you can give someone is the opportunity to do something they really enjoy with others who enjoy it just as much. (Kind of like my husband\u2019s wilderness fishing trips with his college buddies.) \n\nSo she might be giving you the opp to go but with friends instead. Not everyone enjoys multiday festivals: there\u2019s crowds, lines, heat, rain, mud, lots of standing, overpriced food, gross portapotties, etc so she might be willing to give the event a miss this time around. \n\nIf you want to spend the day with her, is there a compromise activity that would work - another (shorter) concert or event? Can she come for a couple of artists and then go?", "NAH\n\nBut I think you can find a middle ground going to Barcelona together and you spend more time in concerts while she shops ir reads. You two will still have time during the day together", "NTA and it\u2019s weird that your wife would bring up the festival and when you say yes, she then says she wouldn\u2019t be going and to celebrate your birthday without her. I don\u2019t know what to make of that. Sorry your wife is being a stick in the mud.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can't suck up not liking an event for your own birthday? Why did she even suggest the idea if she didn't even want to go.", "NAH \n\nI can see how you are disappointed about her not joining since she is the person that you want to go to the festival with, but I can also see how she really probably does feel she\u2019s doing you a favor if she does feel that she\u2019s outgrown it and my hold you back if she\u2019s just not into all of the walking around and crowds, etc. then you might actually feel more bummed or lonely with her there if she doesn\u2019t want to participate in the same way you do. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s just flat out saying that she doesn\u2019t want to go because it\u2019s not her cup of tea, which would be pretty rude since it is your birthday, but it sounds like she\u2019s considering you in the process and thinking that she sees herself bringing you down and doesn\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nMaybe try to keep an open discussion about it between now and when it gets closer.", "NTA.  It sounds like this has been something you've been mentioning for years, and only now is your wife saying it's not for her... You don't suddenly grow out of this sort of thing.  It happens gradually.  Kinda feels like she was stringing you along, hoping you'd lose interest as well.", "NTA, 40 is a major birthday. Your wife actually suggested it and now is backing out... I'd be annoyed too, it's kind of a jerk move on her part.", "NTA", "NAH, if she doesn't want to go she's definitely not going to enhance your experience by being there with you. Just go with a friend and enjoy yourself, you can tell her all about it when you get home.", "NTA and I think saying she's \"grown out of it\" is actually a shitty thing to say and trying to undermine what you want to do.", "YTA \u2026 I mean, if she can take her own car and leave when she\u2019s had enough that\u2019s one thing. Not many people are into big crowds of drunk people listening to music being blasted that you can\u2019t stand or don\u2019t like. \n\nAt least she\u2019s letting you know now vs going and having an attitude about it.", "Maybe you needed to rephrase it earlier on that you wanted to go *with her*. Sow the seed early so she was mentally a little more prepared for it. Kinda ESH because you shouldn\u2019t expect her to go if she doesn\u2019t want to (why not go with your friend and have a great time), but it sounds like you clarified that this was meant to be a special thing with her for your 40th so I would\u2019ve thought she would at least say she\u2019ll think about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both of you are valid in your feelings about this. At least your wife is upfront about not wanting to go...imagine if she said yes, and then made your birthday miserable by making it obvious that she doesn't want to be there. Because it's a milestone birthday, I completely understand why you'd want her there. \n\nThis may be a good compromise...you bring a friend along who wants to go, then you and your wife can do something together either the day before or after to celebrate. I personally celebrate my birthday for the entire week leading up to it, simply because of scheduling conflicts with friends and family who aren't always available to celebrate or want to do the activities planned on the day.", "NTA. Kinda shitty too IMO. Why even bother asking you.", "NAH although I think she could have been clearer in communicating that Primavera did not include her. \n\nYou could compromise on how much time she spends at the event? Go to Barcelona for the weekend, you do one day together or maybe specific activities dispersed through out the weekend that you really \\*really\\* want her there for and during the rest of the time, she can go enjoy what Barcelona has to offer. Meet up in the evening and compare notes!

There\u2019s a difference", "I agree with you. Sucking it up is for low-effort, short-duration activities. My husband can suck it up for Dune: Part II. I don't expect him to suck it up for a whole sci-fi convention in another city, even if it is my birthday.", "Well skydiving i can understand...that is risking your life lol. But horror convention?
