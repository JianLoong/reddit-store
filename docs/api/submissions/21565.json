Most our relationship we went everywhere together just bc thats how it worked out and also I had a feeling he didn't like when I left the house. Granted the first time I wanted to go to Walmart and shop he had a freak out saying why do you need to do alone?? I don't necessarily but I like to do the female thing of mosey-ing around the store and looking at the clothes etc. I know in my mind I'll feel obligated to finish quicker of he comes with.\n\nI started going to the gym in February, he didn't seem encouraging or too thrilled. The gym has made my life so much better and I'm building my confidence all the time now. I have alot of mental health issues and I find it beneficial. \n\nAnyway, I'm unemployed at the moment. He was off since January and this is just his 4th day back at work (injury). I have a savings I'm living off of. We live together. \n\nWell he's gone back to work and some days I leave for the gym after he comes home. I thought this wasn't an issue. \n\nWell apparently I'm cheating because of the time slot I chose. How does that make any sense ???\n\nTLDR\n\nMy boyfriend thinks I'm a cheater bc I go to the grocery store and gym by myself sometimes.\n\nADDED INFO: He also thinks I'm cheating bc I close the apps on my phone often. This is bc I usually play music/YT alot so it helps keep my battery up. He's made comments to me about my clothes \"Are you wearing those?\" when it came to shorts. He's also made comments to me about how I want all the attention by thinking a pair of denim shorts were cute. I got rid of all my shorter shorts bc of him. I used to wear cute denim shorts all the time but ik he wouldn't be comfortable w that. I feel like I've lost myself.\n\nADDED INFO 2.0: \nI've been a sex worker in the past. Not IRL but online. He holds this over my head often and always asks if I'm back online. This is hurtful to me as I told him I only did it bc I felt like i didn't have many options in the past. I don't regret it but it didn't make me feel amazing doing it.

You have found something that is genuinely making you happy and healthy, and he's trying to destroy that. He's selfish and isn't treating you like a person.
