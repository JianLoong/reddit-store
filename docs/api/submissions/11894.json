We have four cats. My wife was due to this week so I took the week off work to be next to her in case she went into labor. \n\nShe started complaining about stomach pain about 7pm and I drove her to the hospital. They said she was not there yet but as she was due they left her in the hospital because our son was surely being born soon. Well we stay there until next morning. At around 5am of the next day my wife was still not ready to push, although the contractions had already started but were not as regular. I told my wife that I was going to check on the cats and I'll be back, she asked me not to do it but I told her we can't have the cats without food and maybe without water for that long time. At the end she agreed although she was not happy. \n\nI drove home (around 20/30 minutes). The cats had little water, no food and their litter box was full. So I cleaned them, then I left extra food and water in case we still had some more hours to wait. I did it as fast as possible, it took me like make half an hour? Then I drove back.\n\nWhen I got to the hospital she was already in the delivery room and the nurses didn't let me in. I had to wait outside with our families. They called me in after he was born to cut the umbilical cord and hold our son. \n\nWife and son had to stay almost a day more in the hospital because they had to checked on the baby and then her doctor was gone, so we had to wait till the next morning. I went again at night to take care of the pets. \n\nMy wife didn't looked angry in the delivery room, she just looked exhausted (obviously, I can't imagine what it's like) but after she woke up from her nap she was annoyed at me. I didn't said anything because I thought she was just tired and irritated. But then we got home and I had to help her out because she was still in some pain, I tried to take as good care of her as I could but I would ask her if she needed something and she would just shrug her shoulders. I asked her if something was wrong and she told me she felt very lonely giving birth by herself. I told her that our timing had sucked because we had been there all night and when I leave she needs to start pushing, but also I told her that we couldn't just leave our pets to starve in our home. We had a bit of an argument about it and then she told me I was an asshole for leaving her when she asked me not to. I know that both of our families are on her side because they told her. Was I really an asshole here? I think that we have responsibilities with our pets too, also I couldn't have imagined that during that 1 1/2 hour she would give birth. But maybe I should've waited for as long as it was necessary next to her?\n\n\nEdit: the cats are shy and get stressed out when they're around strangers, that's why neither my wife or I asked somebody else to go check on them", "created_utc": 1678399629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n5f4d/aita_for_missing_my_childs_birth_because_i_had_to/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For me, big time.\n\nAnd you have a typo: you wrote constructions instead of contractions.", "YTA. I was in the hospital for 4 days giving birth. We had family check in on the animals daily.

Clearly family was available to help.", "YTA\nFamily members were at the hospital. Why didn't you give them a house key to feed the pets, etc., while you supported your wife during a major life event? In her mind your priorities listed the cats over her giving birth to your child. That's going to be a grievance for decades. Good luck.", "YTA. If your cats get stressed around strangers, they'll recover from someone coming in one time to refill their water and food. I feed my friend's cats while she and her husband travel and never actually see the cats because they hide from me.

However, I seriously doubt you couldn\u2019t have googled \u201chow long can cats go without water.\u201d (And did you ask her doctors if you had time?) Yeah it would be a crappy move not to water and feed them but between the two, the bigger fault was not being there for the birth of your child. Your wife asked you to stay; I\u2019d say you broke her trust and left her alone. You should have shown her she mattered more than cats. SUGGESTION: get automatic / Wi-Fi feeder and water dispenser ASAP!!!", "Cats can go more than a day without water, actually. \n\nWas not \u201cstressing out\u201d your cats by having someone else do it worth the cost? \n\nYTA", "Omg. YTA.  Your wife was at a higher risk of dying during childbirth than your cats were of dying from not eating for a few hours. Your wife was going through one of the most painful, traumatic, and scary things a human can go through and you left her there to do it alone.  You were more worried about the cats being skittish around a stranger for 15 min while they filled their food bowl than you were about how afraid your wife must have been to give birth alone.", "Info: why didn\u2019t they let you in the room? You", "The cats are shy? That should have no bearing on someone else going in to fill their food and water and clean the litter box. It\u2019s not like they needed to be coaxed out of their hiding spots to go outside for a walk and a bathroom break. \n\nYTA. I say this mainly because your wife asked you not to leave her during a vulnerable and intense moment, and because you had family around who surely would have helped. This is definitely something you should have planned for. Someone in labor and close to delivery needs a support person for so many reasons.", "YTA. If she was high risk enough that you needed to take  a week off of work; why didn't your plan include someone to check on the cats?\n\nYour deliberate emphasis on exactly how much TIME each task took, tells me you really do not understand what the priority should have been. \n\nYou planned ahead for everything EXCEPT the freaking birth.", "yta. cats would\u2019ve been fine not eating for another few hours, or you could\u2019ve asked someone to go check on them for you", "NTA\n\nIf your cats had gone without food and water for that long, and nobody else could do it, you did the right thing.  Ideally, sure, you would have been back before she gave birth. \n\nOr, perhaps, should have left before then.  But, hindsight is 20/20, and I think her parents and her are being AHs for blaming you for wanting to make sure the cats are taken care of as well.\n\nAfter all, you can't completely neglect your cats because your wife might give birth during that brief interim.   You had no idea how long it would take.  Nor did she.", "YTA. The cats would have been fine for a day or even two. Very hungry, yes, but still fine, if nobody could check on them for a short while. \n\nAlso just because they get stressed around other people doesn't mean that they will die if a stranger checks in on them and feeds and waters them a couple of times while you're away. They will recover. Others are right, you can't get this moment back with your wife. Hopefully you guys will be able to resolve this and move on together. \n\nCongratulations on the birth of your son to you both!", "YTA, she asked you to stay and you didn\u2019t. \n\nShe or the baby could\u2019ve died giving birth but you were more worried about your cats.", "YTA You should have left extra food and water when you left for the hospital or got someone else to do it.\nIf the cats are shy they would have just hidden and come out after they left \nBugger the litter tray.

What husband thinks it\u2019s even possible that cat comforts could be more important than their wife and the birth of their first child?", "This very much sounds like a post in r/offmychest yesterday, where a father had to leave the hospital to walk the dogs and missed the birth.... Only in that other post it was the wife writing, and the new dad actually was way more justified than the OP here.", "YTA\n\nBefore we go on a trip, we set up the long term feed and water containers. You took the week off to be by her but part of it should have been preparing. \n\nFirst thing would be to have someone with an emergency key for any need including the cat. \n\nShe\u2019s busy being exhausted and growing a child, you as the other adult needed to have PREPARED. \n\nAlso, whenever we go somewhere at the spur of the moment we open the toilet lid for emergency cat water.

And good god your edit makes you so much worse!! You clearly have family / friends that could have checked on the cats. You literally prioritized your CATS stress over your wife\u2019s.

Poor judgement call.\nYTA", "Your cats are shy which is why you didn't let anyone else in the house to put some water in their bowl. But your wife was scarred and giving birth and you left her alone?", "YTA on so many levels. You didn't think that your wife might deliver the baby while you were gone, you didn't make a plan for care of the cats while she was in labor, and you don't think leaving was wrong. The cats can be shy around other people, but the person stopping to clean the litter box and make sure they have food and water doesn't need to see them, they just need to clean the litter box, fill dishes, and go. At a minimum, you could've left extra food and water when leaving for the hospital.", "Yeah YTA. I say this as a cat owner of 18 years. The cats would have been fine either going for a day without food or having someone else come feed them. They\u2019re self sufficient critters and probably wouldn\u2019t have been happy about it, but they would have been totally fine. If they\u2019re as shy as you say they are, they just would have hid while someone else came in to feed them if you had delegated that job to someone else. It wouldn\u2019t have been detrimental to them at all. Alternatively, you could have taken 10 extra minutes and made sure the litter box was clean and they had extra food and water before you left the house. \n\nLeaving your wife and missing the birth because you decided that going home to feed the cats was your #1 priority was a bad call on your part.

YTA", "YTA, bruh.\n\nThey are CATS, and this was ONE NIGHT.    Even if you had not refilled their water and scooped their litter that morning, they would have done just fine until you got home.   Hell, even if it had been a dog, at worst you would have had to pick up a pile or two  of clean up a piss spot on the rug.   \n\nYou bounced and left your wife at the hospital over her explicit objections while she was in active labor to go and do something that, by any objective standard, could have been done by a neighbor, or a family member, or waited until later.    \n\nMy wife is as sweet as can be,  but if i had pulled something like that when she was in labor with our girls, she\u2019d have kicked my nuts clean through the roof of my mouth, and frankly, she\u2019d be justified.

Cats are more self sufficient than other pets.", "Biggest YTA I have ever seen.

Cats are incredibly easy to leave on their own, you just get a refilling cat food bowl, if they run out of water (unlikely) they'll be happy with the toilet for a day.

There are cat sitters you can pay to do this.", "YTA hardcore. Look, I\u2019m a crazy cat lady, and my husband did go home to check on the cats while I was in the hospital after giving birth, but not WHILE I was in labor!

It is important to take it seriously when you\u2019ve taken responsibility for animals, but your response here was completely out of proportion. \n\nYour cats may not like having strangers around but a family member popping in to put down some fresh water and food would not have been enough to create any lasting harm. \nYou leaving your wife as she was starting a hugely stressful, painful and important (and in some cases dangerous) process should have taken priority over your cats being briefly freaked out by the presence of a family member.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou owe your wife a massive apology.

Of course don't let them starve, but a pet sitter once is not going to do lasting damage.", "NAH, we can rip you bits over \"should haves\", but that's irrelevant.  You were being a responsible pet owner, just ill timed.  She's also dealing with crazy hormones on top of healing and caring for this new human.

We have four cats. My wife was due to this week so I took the week off work to be next to her in case she went into labor. \n\nShe started complaining about stomach pain about 7pm and I drove her to the hospital. They said she was not there yet but as she was due they left her in the hospital because our son was surely being born soon. Well we stay there until next morning. At around 5am of the next day my wife was still not ready to push, although the constructions had already started but were not as regular. I told my wife that I was going to check on the cats and I'll be back, she asked me not to do it but I told her we can't have the cats without food and maybe without water for that long time. At the end she agreed although she was not happy. \n\nI drove home (around 20/30 minutes). The cats had little water, no food and their litter box was full. So I cleaned them, then I left extra food and water in case we still had some more hours to wait. I did it as fast as possible, it took me like make half an hour? Then I drove back.\n\nWhen I got to the hospital she was already in the delivery room and the nurses didn't let me in. I had to wait outside with our families. They called me in after he was born to cut the umbilical cord and hold our son. \n\nWife and son had to stay almost a day more in the hospital because they had to checked on the baby and then her doctor was gone, so we had to wait till the next morning. I went again at night to take care of the pets. \n\nMy wife didn't looked angry in the delivery room, she just looked exhausted (obviously, I can't imagine what it's like) but after she woke up from her nap she was annoyed at me. I didn't said anything because I thought she was just tired and irritated. But then we got home and I had to help her out because she was still in some pain, I tried to take as good care of her as I could but I would ask her if she needed something and she would just shrug her shoulders. I asked her if something was wrong and she told me she felt very lonely giving birth by herself. I told her that our timing had sucked because we had been there all night and when I leave she needs to start pushing, but also I told her that we couldn't just leave our pets to starve in our home. We had a bit of an argument about it and then she told me I was an asshole for leaving her when she asked me not to. I know that both of our families are on her side because they told her. Was I really an asshole here? I think that we have responsibilities with our pets too, also I couldn't have imagined that during that 1 1/2 hour she would give birth. But maybe I should've waited for as long as it was necessary next to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
