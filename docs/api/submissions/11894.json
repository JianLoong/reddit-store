We have four cats. My wife was due to this week so I took the week off work to be next to her in case she went into labor. \n\nShe started complaining about stomach pain about 7pm and I drove her to the hospital. They said she was not there yet but as she was due they left her in the hospital because our son was surely being born soon. Well we stay there until next morning. At around 5am of the next day my wife was still not ready to push, although the contractions had already started but were not as regular. I told my wife that I was going to check on the cats and I'll be back, she asked me not to do it but I told her we can't have the cats without food and maybe without water for that long time. At the end she agreed although she was not happy. \n\nI drove home (around 20/30 minutes). The cats had little water, no food and their litter box was full. So I cleaned them, then I left extra food and water in case we still had some more hours to wait. I did it as fast as possible, it took me like make half an hour? Then I drove back.\n\nWhen I got to the hospital she was already in the delivery room and the nurses didn't let me in. I had to wait outside with our families. They called me in after he was born to cut the umbilical cord and hold our son. \n\nWife and son had to stay almost a day more in the hospital because they had to checked on the baby and then her doctor was gone, so we had to wait till the next morning. I went again at night to take care of the pets. \n\nMy wife didn't looked angry in the delivery room, she just looked exhausted (obviously, I can't imagine what it's like) but after she woke up from her nap she was annoyed at me. I didn't said anything because I thought she was just tired and irritated. But then we got home and I had to help her out because she was still in some pain, I tried to take as good care of her as I could but I would ask her if she needed something and she would just shrug her shoulders. I asked her if something was wrong and she told me she felt very lonely giving birth by herself. I told her that our timing had sucked because we had been there all night and when I leave she needs to start pushing, but also I told her that we couldn't just leave our pets to starve in our home. We had a bit of an argument about it and then she told me I was an asshole for leaving her when she asked me not to. I know that both of our families are on her side because they told her. Was I really an asshole here? I think that we have responsibilities with our pets too, also I couldn't have imagined that during that 1 1/2 hour she would give birth. But maybe I should've waited for as long as it was necessary next to her?\n\n\nEdit: the cats are shy and get stressed out when they're around strangers, that's why neither my wife or I asked somebody else to go check on them", "created_utc": 1678399629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n5f4d/aita_for_missing_my_childs_birth_because_i_had_to/", "score": 1981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For me, big time.\n\nAnd you have a typo: you wrote constructions instead of contractions.", "YTA. I was in the hospital for 4 days giving birth. We had family check in on the animals daily.

Clearly family was available to help.", "YTA\nFamily members were at the hospital. Why didn't you give them a house key to feed the pets, etc., while you supported your wife during a major life event? In her mind your priorities listed the cats over her giving birth to your child. That's going to be a grievance for decades. Good luck.", "YTA. If your cats get stressed around strangers, they'll recover from someone coming in one time to refill their water and food. I feed my friend's cats while she and her husband travel and never actually see the cats because they hide from me.

However, I seriously doubt you couldn\u2019t have googled \u201chow long can cats go without water.\u201d (And did you ask her doctors if you had time?) Yeah it would be a crappy move not to water and feed them but between the two, the bigger fault was not being there for the birth of your child. Your wife asked you to stay; I\u2019d say you broke her trust and left her alone. You should have shown her she mattered more than cats.

YTA.  Your wife was at a higher risk of dying during childbirth than your cats were of dying from not eating for a few hours. Your wife was going through one of the most painful, traumatic, and scary things a human can go through and you left her there to do it alone.  You were more worried about the cats being skittish around a stranger for 15 min while they filled their food bowl than you were about how afraid your wife must have been to give birth alone.", "Info: why didn\u2019t they let you in the room? You", "The cats are shy? That should have no bearing on someone else going in to fill their food and water and clean the litter box. It\u2019s not like they needed to be coaxed out of their hiding spots to go outside for a walk and a bathroom break. \n\nYTA. I say this mainly because your wife asked you not to leave her during a vulnerable and intense moment, and because you had family around who surely would have helped. This is definitely something you should have planned for. Someone in labor and close to delivery needs a support person for so many reasons.", "YTA. If she was high risk enough that you needed to take  a week off of work; why didn't your plan include someone to check on the cats?\n\nYour deliberate emphasis on exactly how much TIME each task took, tells me you really do not understand what the priority should have been. \n\nYou planned ahead for everything EXCEPT the freaking birth.", "yta. cats would\u2019ve been fine not eating for another few hours, or you could\u2019ve asked someone to go check on them for you", "NTA\n\nIf your cats had gone without food and water for that long, and nobody else could do it, you did the right thing.  Ideally, sure, you would have been back before she gave birth. \n\nOr, perhaps, should have left before then.  But, hindsight is 20/20, and I think her parents and her are being AHs for blaming you for wanting to make sure the cats are taken care of as well.\n\nAfter all, you can't completely neglect your cats because your wife might give birth during that brief interim.   You had no idea how long it would take.  Nor did she.", "YTA. The cats would have been fine for a day or even two. Very hungry, yes, but still fine, if nobody could check on them for a short while. \n\nAlso just because they get stressed around other people doesn't mean that they will die if a stranger checks in on them and feeds and waters them a couple of times while you're away. They will recover. Others are right, you can't get this moment back with your wife. Hopefully you guys will be able to resolve this and move on together. \n\nCongratulations on the birth of your son to you both!", "YTA, she asked you to stay and you didn\u2019t. \n\nShe or the baby could\u2019ve died giving birth but you were more worried about your cats.", "YTA You should have left extra food and water when you left for the hospital or got someone else to do it.\nIf the cats are shy they would have just hidden and come out after they left \nBugger the litter tray.

What husband thinks it\u2019s even possible that cat comforts could be more important than their wife and the birth of their first child?", "This very much sounds like a post in r/offmychest yesterday, where a father had to leave the hospital to walk the dogs and missed the birth.... Only in that other post it was the wife writing, and the new dad actually was way more justified than the OP here.", "YTA\n\nBefore we go on a trip, we set up the long term feed and water containers. You took the week off to be by her but part of it should have been preparing. \n\nFirst thing would be to have someone with an emergency key for any need including the cat. \n\nShe\u2019s busy being exhausted and growing a child, you as the other adult needed to have PREPARED. \n\nAlso, whenever we go somewhere at the spur of the moment we open the toilet lid for emergency cat water. It\u2019s just automatic. \n\n\nYTA\n\nEspecially since at the hospital they tell you how dilated she is and you can go prep the cat much earlier in labor then right at the end.", "YTA. And good god your edit makes you so much worse!! You clearly have family / friends that could have checked on the cats. You literally prioritized your CATS stress over your wife\u2019s.

Poor judgement call.\nYTA", "Your cats are shy which is why you didn't let anyone else in the house to put some water in their bowl. But your wife was scarred and giving birth and you left her alone?", "YTA on so many levels. You didn't think that your wife might deliver the baby while you were gone, you didn't make a plan for care of the cats while she was in labor, and you don't think leaving was wrong. The cats can be shy around other people, but the person stopping to clean the litter box and make sure they have food and water doesn't need to see them, they just need to clean the litter box, fill dishes, and go. At a minimum, you could've left extra food and water when leaving for the hospital.", "Yeah YTA. I say this as a cat owner of 18 years. The cats would have been fine either going for a day without food or having someone else come feed them. They\u2019re self sufficient critters and probably wouldn\u2019t have been happy about it, but they would have been totally fine. If they\u2019re as shy as you say they are, they just would have hid while someone else came in to feed them if you had delegated that job to someone else. It wouldn\u2019t have been detrimental to them at all. Alternatively, you could have taken 10 extra minutes and made sure the litter box was clean and they had extra food and water before you left the house. \n\nLeaving your wife and missing the birth because you decided that going home to feed the cats was your #1 priority was a bad call on your part.

YTA", "YTA, bruh.\n\nThey are CATS, and this was ONE NIGHT.    Even if you had not refilled their water and scooped their litter that morning, they would have done just fine until you got home.   Hell, even if it had been a dog, at worst you would have had to pick up a pile or two  of clean up a piss spot on the rug.   \n\nYou bounced and left your wife at the hospital over her explicit objections while she was in active labor to go and do something that, by any objective standard, could have been done by a neighbor, or a family member, or waited until later.    \n\nMy wife is as sweet as can be,  but if i had pulled something like that when she was in labor with our girls, she\u2019d have kicked my nuts clean through the roof of my mouth, and frankly, she\u2019d be justified.

Cats are more self sufficient than other pets.", "Biggest YTA I have ever seen.

Cats are incredibly easy to leave on their own, you just get a refilling cat food bowl, if they run out of water (unlikely) they'll be happy with the toilet for a day.

There are cat sitters you can pay to do this.", "YTA hardcore. Look, I\u2019m a crazy cat lady, and my husband did go home to check on the cats while I was in the hospital after giving birth, but not WHILE I was in labor!

It is important to take it seriously when you\u2019ve taken responsibility for animals, but your response here was completely out of proportion. \n\nYour cats may not like having strangers around but a family member popping in to put down some fresh water and food would not have been enough to create any lasting harm. \nYou leaving your wife as she was starting a hugely stressful, painful and important (and in some cases dangerous) process should have taken priority over your cats being briefly freaked out by the presence of a family member.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou owe your wife a massive apology.

Of course don't let them starve, but a pet sitter once is not going to do lasting damage.", "NAH, we can rip you bits over \"should haves\", but that's irrelevant.

We have four cats. My wife was due to this week so I took the week off work to be next to her in case she went into labor. \n\nShe started complaining about stomach pain about 7pm and I drove her to the hospital. They said she was not there yet but as she was due they left her in the hospital because our son was surely being born soon. Well we stay there until next morning. At around 5am of the next day my wife was still not ready to push, although the constructions had already started but were not as regular. I told my wife that I was going to check on the cats and I'll be back, she asked me not to do it but I told her we can't have the cats without food and maybe without water for that long time. At the end she agreed although she was not happy. \n\nI drove home (around 20/30 minutes). The cats had little water, no food and their litter box was full. So I cleaned them, then I left extra food and water in case we still had some more hours to wait. I did it as fast as possible, it took me like make half an hour? Then I drove back.\n\nWhen I got to the hospital she was already in the delivery room and the nurses didn't let me in. I had to wait outside with our families. They called me in after he was born to cut the umbilical cord and hold our son. \n\nWife and son had to stay almost a day more in the hospital because they had to checked on the baby and then her doctor was gone, so we had to wait till the next morning. I went again at night to take care of the pets. \n\nMy wife didn't looked angry in the delivery room, she just looked exhausted (obviously, I can't imagine what it's like) but after she woke up from her nap she was annoyed at me. I didn't said anything because I thought she was just tired and irritated. But then we got home and I had to help her out because she was still in some pain, I tried to take as good care of her as I could but I would ask her if she needed something and she would just shrug her shoulders. I asked her if something was wrong and she told me she felt very lonely giving birth by herself. I told her that our timing had sucked because we had been there all night and when I leave she needs to start pushing, but also I told her that we couldn't just leave our pets to starve in our home. We had a bit of an argument about it and then she told me I was an asshole for leaving her when she asked me not to. I know that both of our families are on her side because they told her. Was I really an asshole here? I think that we have responsibilities with our pets too, also I couldn't have imagined that during that 1 1/2 hour she would give birth. But maybe I should've waited for as long as it was necessary next to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm also not sure why they wouldn't let you go back to the delivery room when you got back to the hospital, considering your wife wanted you there, so to an extent it wasn't 100% your fault you weren't in the room, but like 99%. You still should have stayed regardless and you will just need to give your wife some time to heal from it, physically and emotionally.

It's not like an opera where you have to wait for intermission if you're late.  You should have left extra food out for the cats when you left. If you didn't and were so worried, you need to ask someone else to stop by.  That person didn't have to interact with the cats, just leave food out and go.

OK, then you need to go all 'independent survival mode'.  Get a few extra litter boxes, a few automatic feeder bowls, and another water fountain - that way, if you need to leave the cats home alone for a full day (or two), they'll have food/water/litterboxes to use. (If the autofeeders are too expensive, then just put out double the bowls and double the food.)\n\nThese are just two examples of how you could've prepared for the birth.\n\nBut let's say you had a plan for the cats, but it fell through horribly. Ok, shit happens. You don't leave your wife when she's giving birth, especially if it's her first time. There are so many things that can go wrong, and you are legally speaking her next of kin.

Your cats would have been ok for one visit from someone else.", "YTA.\n\nI can't comprehend why you didn't situate the cats before you left. I leave my cat for up to 4 days at a time with no one checking on her. Cats are the least care intensive pet you can have and it takes me all of 10 minutes before departing my home to leave food, water and scoop. \n\nAlso even if you didn't do these things before you left they would have absolutely been fine. It's honestly so weird that you were concerned about them at that moment over your wife and son.", "YTA\nYou know women die during labor, right? Even in first world countries.

Cats?!\n\nLook, I get that cats aren't as independent and low maintenance as people think they are, but for 24 hours, they can deal. If you'd REALLY planned ahead you could have had them on an automatic feeder, and had a friend or neighbor take care of the litter boxes, but even with the lack of planning, they would have been fine.

Your wife just had her entire life, psyche, and body torn apart and turned upside down. You fucked up and now you need to do everything, EVERYTHING, to make it ok and to support her as she adjusts to this absolute insane new phase of her life. You better be there next to her feeding her, watering her, showering her with love and letting her grieve the moment she lost while trying to sustain a new life.

Water and food also running low?\n\nEdit: wait you say litter box. Do you only have one for four cats?", "As a 9 month pregnant animal owner, I can tell you that you are absolutely YTA. Let me tell you why:\n\n1) The birth of your child is a beautiful event. It is where you close the part of your life as just a husband and wife and open a new chapter as a family. Your wife clearly wanted you to be with her during this process, and you left her. Even if you have future kids, this was your one and only \u201cfirst\u201d child. That was a once in a lifetime event, and you blew it. \n\n2) The birth of your child is also incredibly traumatic. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a natural birth, she had an epidural, or c section. The possibilities of complications are real. Could you push out a watermelon out of something the size of a lemon? That is why people hire doulas and birthing partners just for support. She thought she had you for support, and you left her alone. \n\n3) Let me tell you something apparently you don\u2019t know: cats are shy and scared by nature. Have you never heard of a scaredy cat? That is slang for a reason. If you didn\u2019t want to board them, I can respect that. But you know what would have been a good solution? Leaving out several extra containers of food, water, and litter for them while you were gone. You also stated you were there 30 minutes. So, you didn\u2019t really play with them anyway. So why would it have mattered if they hid under the bed for 30 minutes while your family or help replenished their supplies? \n\nAll of this could have been overlooked if it wasn\u2019t for your wife asking for you, her husband and father of your child, to stay and help her during the time in her life when she needed you more than ever. And you abandoned her. \n\nYou better reevaluate your priorities or else the only living things at your house will be your beloved cats. Forget dad of the year, your a****** of the year.", "YTA. omg my cats are \"shy\" too.. aka terrified of anyone but us... We still had my mom stop by to give them food/water because there was no way my husband was going to leave me in labor alone. You better be extra kind to her.", "YTA and she will never ever forget this. You have no idea how important it probably was for you to be there for her. \n\nI just gave birth 2 months ago and guess what? There was a plan for my dog and cat. My cat is shy and my dog can be an asshole about being walked and there was STILL a plan. \n\nAlso, you really could have left enough water out, had an extra litter box, gotten an automatic feeder so you could feed them while at the hospital. So many options.", "Yeah YTA. Not stressing out your cats is the lamest excuse ever.", "I can\u2019t tell if this is real or not but just in case, YTA. \n\nYou missed your child\u2019s birth over cats? Who cares if you \u201cdidn\u2019t think\u201d she wouldn\u2019t have given birth by the time you got back\u2026 she asked you not to.

Based on what? Respectfully, do you not know how the birthing process works and how quickly pushing comes as she\u2019s dilating? Surely the nurses were keeping track so you knew that it was coming eventually. What made you think it wasn\u2019t coming so fast? \n\nEither way, your wife asked you not go and you disrespected her and made her feel awful, how lonely and embarrassing for her to have on her mind the first time she held your son.

They could have handled having someone come over once so that you could be present for your child's birth.", "I had 2 cats, 1 of them was extremely shy.

You should've plan this better, give them more food or buy an automatic feeder, give them extra water or simple have someone do that for you. YTA", "YTA.  As other people have said, you had months to prepare for this moment.

If THAT was not an option, unless your cats are severely neglected, they would have been fine for a while longer without food and water.   YOU had one chance to witness your son being brought into this world and to be there to support your wife during this birth and you missed it.  You need to do everything in your power to be there now for your wife to try to make it up to her. \n\nAlso your excuse of your cats being shy so you didn't want a stranger taking care of them,  is flimsy at best.   To top off their food and water requires little to no interaction.", "YTA. They are cats. You should have planned better. You should have left out extra food and water before you left, and they would have been fine. Cats are independent and would have been fine for the extra time.", "YTA. Cats are the easiest animals to prep", "YTA but there\u2019s some things you need to fix for your story. \n\nYou didn\u2019t stay up all night from 7pm to 5am waiting for the birth of your first baby and than decide the cats needed to eat and drink. \n\nThe nurses also wouldn\u2019t have kept you out, you cut the umbilical cord while they\u2019re still pushing something that\u2019s not the baby out and that\u2019s were most hemorrhaging is, so it makes little to zero sense to keep you out until then, and there\u2019s always a doctor available, no one had to wait for \u201chers\u201d.

At all times, you should have water enough to last your cats (or dogs) for as long as it would take for family or friends to go check on your pets if you DIED. Animals can survive without food for days, if worse comes to worst, but water\u2026water is life. This is Animal Care 101.\n\nSorry, OP, but YTA for not having a loved one or petsitter on call to take care of the cats whenever your wife went into labor, and most definitely YTA for not understanding basic, basic care principles for the pets whose very lives depend on you.", "Thisssss.

As someone who had a cat that due to abuse was incredibly shy? Why didn't you give them extra food and water before you left? Why not still ask family because your wife and baby should be more important than the cats. Mind you I actually have broken up with people over my cats but that's not even on this level. They tried the me or the cats routine and those cats were there first and clearly this meant we did not share core values. You married this person and chose to reproduce with them. That means you should have aligning core values that do not include abandoning them during a stressful time because your cats are more important. You literally did a divorce level fuck up", "And for a lot of women, myself included, having your person there with you the whole time is the #1 thing. Having my hubby by my side was more important to me than where I gave birth, who my doctor was, and how my plans changed for our emergency c section.

No excuses, just be there for her now. \nYTA.", "YTA but the reason is for your awful planning. Why was there no plan for feeding the cats while you were at the hospital?!? I agree someone needed to check on them, but it absolutely shouldn't have been YOU.", "I can\u2019t help but think that this guy does stupid stuff like this a lot.

What a dingus.", "Or put down an extra bowl before you left?", "You\u2019re hitting subtly where my head was at\u2026 and I dont think we\u2019re getting the full story.

Him holding my hand, encouraging me, the look of wonder on his face as labour progressed. I\u2019ll never forget those moments. \n\nHis wife?

Putting food and water in a bowl doesn't require them to be involved, I'd expect them to just hide the entire time.  Bet they're gonna be stressed as fuck with a new baby crying all the time, I'm just baffled", "He was more concerned about the cats being stressed from having a stranger feed them one time than his wife being stressed *while giving birth to their first child ALONE*.", "Agree. My 3 cats don't like people either, they hide and come out when people gone. We have been late feeding and they were fine.

It sounds like he left when he knew labor was about to start in earnest and conveniently got to miss the intense, scary part.", "Not to mention that shy cats can just... hide while the person is there and then come out for the food/water later?

You have pets and their food should\u2019ve been prepared for a long day, litter should\u2019ve been cleaned and set right before leaving for the hospital. I know because I have pets.

No, because you don't need to be there the whole time they eat. You fill up their food and water and get out. They'll eat when they're ready.", "The cats being shy is a moot point. They don't need to watch you fill the bowls with food and water. Literally anyone could have done it and they would have been fine. Or no one could have done it and they'd still be fine.

The cats would have been fine.", "You don't understand. That cats are shy and get stressed around other people, so family couldn't take care of them. He had to be the one to leave. Yes, his wife was going through one of the most difficult moments of her life, yes he made vows to stand by her, but think of the cats! He also has a responsibility to them! Over his wife and son. Because they might get stressed. Cats might have been stressed, people!!!!", "I\u2019m just over here like\u2026bruh. Get an electronic/scheduled feeder. Reservoir water bowl.

They even have pet feeders that out dispense food.", "Yeah I could understand not sending a stranger to the cats if they were cat sitting for 2 weeks but they had to go in clean the litter box and give them food then leave, they didn't even have to interact with the cats if the cats didn't want. He also could have made sure everything was sorted hours before this she was in labour all night she could have gone 3 or 5 hours in and been back and they would have been fine until after the birth. \n\nIts like he really did not think any of this through at all.", "Can you explain to me why it matters if the cats were shy?  When I took care of a friends cat, the cat went away when I showed up, came back out when I left.  I would almost think it would be easier because you won\u2019t have to worry about a cat making a run for it.", "I mean, if I put down extra food it would be gone in the first half hour. But yeah, a family member should have gone if it was necessary. And it wasn't even necessary yet.

The cats don't participate in the putting out of food & water, or the litter box cleaning.  They'd just hide and come out after the person left.  Done.\n\nMind-boggling that his thoughts were anywhere other than with his wife.", "Childbirth cannot be nearly as stressful as being a cat around a stranger", "OP hand feeds them peeled grapes.", "Right? They are cats. You don't need to see them to feed them. No way this is real.", "I know those poor cats...I doubt they'd recover from the  stress of someone opening the door and refilling their food and water bowls and leaving. After all, child birth is known the world over as easy, breezy, lemon squeezy, cough twice and the baby pops out.", "His pathetic excuse in his edit is that his cats are nervous/anxious around strangers, so **ABSOLUTELY NO ONE ELSE IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD** can sneak in to feed/water the kitties....(/s) (my eyes are stuck they've rolled so far back into my skull)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedited a typo and stuff", "Yeah I know not all cats have willpower like the old man and old lady I just lost do (I do mean old old. 21 for her and 16 for him so brain is okay because amazing lifetimes).

Which dude had 9 months to sort out", "I also think this must be a typical pattern of behavior for OP, since none of the family in the waiting room even tries to stop him from leaving. When you have a family member who is just an incorrigible idiot you stop trying. \n\nEither this story is fake or the wife is quietly getting her ducks in a row for divorce. \n\nOne thing that makes me think it's fake is taking a week off around her due date. If this is US that's typically not possible and the window to give birth is more like 3-4 weeks (anywhere from week 38 to 42)", "When my cat got stressed out by strangers she hid under a bed.  Had a neighbor who took care of the two cats for a week and the friendly one met her at the door and never let her alone.
