These children in particular often stop having meltdowns within a few days if they're not rewarded for them and if they learn to articulate their emotions. \n\nI'm not saying that this is the case here, but there are a LOT of people in the psychology field who are lazy and don't take parenting and the *functions* of behavior into account. I obviously don't know the full picture from one reddit post.

I know you don't want them to feel how you felt, so let's go sit down/do this other activity so they can calm down.\" It helps explain what's happening directly and relates it to an experience she had. \n\nIt sounds like he didn't have any activities to do, and that's poor parenting, even more so with a child that's neurodivergent. Visiting people is a grown up activity. While kids like seeing others, it's incredibly boring and unfair to expect them to sit nicely at the table as the adults chat about people they don't know and about things that they don't care about, plus a new environment is incredibly stimulating and exhausting so they're more likely to get tired or frustrated and have a tantrum as a result.

If she doesn't root into some better behaviors, she'll find herself isolated and friendless for reasons she can't understand.  It's hard and lonely way to go through life (ask me how I know).
