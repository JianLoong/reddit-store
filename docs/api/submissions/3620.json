I have autism myself and remember being over stimulated when younger.\n\nMy brother brought his kids when he visited with my mum (my mum didnt tell me he was coming with her until the day but thats a seperate problem). I'd been going through a horrible time and asked my mum to see me so we could talk.\n\nAfter a meal they came to my house for a cup of tea and that's when my niece was rather excited.\n\nI have 4 cats and my niece didnt treat them well. Chasing them, aggressive patting, yelling in their faces, grabbing them, one of my cats is blind and was hiding and she tried to pull him out his hiding spot. I repeatedly had to stop her while my brother sat and said nothing. My niece has aspergers and grew up with staffie dogs so, again, I don't blame her being heavy handed and excited around them, expecting them to be like her pet dogs. But my brother just LET HER terrify my cats and watched me, not the parent, have to remove her from my bedroom (that I told him they can't go in because, my blind cat was hiding there) and struggle to calm her down for 2 hours.\n\nBut not even just that, she ripped open my cupboard and threw all their toys and treats all over the floor and at the cats. Was jumping on my treadmill and threw my gym clothes off screaming at me to turn it on for her. Poured her chocolate on the floor and left them where the cats could eat it. All while brother WATCHED, right in the sane room, and did NOTHING. He didn't even try to pick up the food she threw all over the floor.\n\nSo I got frustrated and asked him to calm her down. Nothing I was doing or saying was stopping her. He told me to stop being a pr*ck and she'll just tire herself out eventually. That I needed to f*ck off about a little mess. My biggest problem wasn't the mess it was my terrified cats.

That sucks, but they don't deserved to be abused. Even if she \"didn't mean it\", your niece was abusing your pets, and you need to keep them safe.\n\nI honestly wouldn't allow them back.

How dare you ask a parent to mind their own child.", "NTA, he is not making sense.  I am not sure this is even good for his daughter.", "NTA in any way whatsoever. As the parent, your brother has the obligation to look after his daughter and help direct her behavior - especially if she is a visitor at someone else's home. It's his responsibility to teach her how to interact with animals properly, and how to be respectful of another person's space and belongings. Your brother is a huge A H for not doing anything to help and for cussing you out when you tried to recruit his assistance. I wouldn't let him back into my home.

Info: is he still together with your niece\u2019s mom? Because if he is, I have a feeling that relationship won\u2019t last much longer. He sounds completely checked out.", "NTA. Your brother doesn't respect your home or you. When he's over, he should be expected to leave your home in the same state as when he arrived. Anything his daughter messes, he is responsible for. Awful parenting on his part.", "NTA!!! \n\nUnacceptable behavior and very selfish on your brothers part. Set boundaries and let him know that if he wants to continue to come to your place then he needs to make sure your niece is not terrorizing the place & your poor cats", "NTA.  It is the parent's job to control their child.  Don't allow him in your home anymore.", "NTA. It's not OK for her to behave like this around your cats. If she and her parents can't control her behavior, then they need to remove her to a place where she can behave this way without assaulting your cats.", "Hard NTA. Please put your cats in a safe space when she comes over until she learns how to properly interact with them. \n\nI have autism myself, and that\u2019s not an excuse to terrorize animals. \nAlso this is a horrible precedent her father is setting for her interacting with animals. Strange animals are not going to be okay with her behavior, and will likely injure her. \n\nOne of my rescue dogs (gulliver) is a \u201cchild biter\u201d. His former owners used to let their autistic son terrorize him. Final incident was the child chasing the dog under a bed and crawling in face first after him. \nGuess what the dog did? He bit him.\nIf I was not in the unique position to transfer liability to me, Gulliver would have been put down. (It\u2019s almost impossible to rehome a dog with a bite, and most dogs that bite children will be immediately euthanized) \nWanna know what\u2019s wild? He actually adores kids. Children who respect his space, and give him gentle tummy rubs. It\u2019s my responsibility to ensure the kids are treating him correctly, and removing either the kids, or him from any uncomfortable situations.", "I interned at a facility this past summer that served individuals with developmental disabilities, and one of my supervisors said that sometimes, parents will seek an autism diagnosis for their child because they're having meltdowns, but in reality they don't do anything to discourage their child from having meltdowns(ie, they give in to what the child wants after an hour, so the child essentially learns \"okay, I need to have a meltdown for an hour before I get what I want.\" It's a lot more complicated than that, and the kids aren't bad kids, but that's the simple breakdown). These children in particular often stop having meltdowns within a few days if they're not rewarded for them and if they learn to articulate their emotions. \n\nI'm not saying that this is the case here, but there are a LOT of people in the psychology field who are lazy and don't take parenting and the *functions* of behavior into account. I obviously don't know the full picture from one reddit post. But even if your niece does have autism, a meltdown is a sign of discomfort, and the fact that he did nothing to stop it (or to stop the destruction of your property!) shows that he's probably not the best parent.

Period. \n\nHe disrespected you, your cats, your home, and even his own daughter by not reigning in her behavior.\n\nYour mom also participated in this and apparently did nothing either. \n\nIf the daughter wants to destroy Grandma's house, that's her choice, but you don't have to put up with that in your home.", "NTA\n\nHer behavior is coming more from lax parenting than her autism. \n\nYou owe us cat tax.", "NTA Overreacted over a bunch of pets?! wtf! Does he want to get treated like this? Especially if he is blind?! What an awful thinking. As if animals are toys. I fear for their pet. He is an awful father. Let the daughter behave like she wants.
