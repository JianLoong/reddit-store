It sucks you like the same name and the timing of your pregnancies is unfortunate. But it is a really nice name and it makes sense you all would like to use it, so I don't think anyone is willing it out of spite or to hurt anyone. ESH is just because of your poor communication. Who ever is born first gets to use it  without a question and if the other one decides to use it too, then you just have to be ok with the girls having the same name.", "YTA you picked Elizabeth and she picked (formally) Elizabeth but said lizzy for short.\nStick to your guns and call your kid Elizabeth.

This madness of 'calling dibs' on a name needs to end. Both of your reasons for choosing the name are valid and you've both chosen a name that has multiple nicknames available if you really want to differentiate colloquially. This is such a non-issue.

They are all different people and it has never been an issue. \n\nMy younger brother shares a first name with countless generations of first-born dudes on my mom's side.

You want to name your daughter after a deceased loved-one. Thus far, you are equal. You do not have dibs on this name, or a more important reason that it should be set aside for you. Demanding that your stepmom step aside for you is an asshole move, especially since she's likely to give birth first, so if anyone gets dibs...\n\nYou need to get used to the fact that both of your daughters are going to have the same first name. But luckily you've chosen one of the names with the most historical/regional variations and nicknames possible, so there's still plenty of wiggle room to differentiate the girls for everyday usage. Your half sister (named for Beth) will be Lizzie for short, so maybe your daughter can be Liana, Lilian, Lilibet, Libby, Liza, Eliza, Elsie, Ellie, Betty, Betsy, Bess, or any of the other myriad of options that aren't Beth or Lizzie. \n\nOr if you don't want them to share a first name, then you can swap your names around and call your daughter Katherine Elizabeth, also honouring your/your partner's grandmothers. It won't honour your grandmother any less to be the middle name.", "Yta just name your kid Elizabeth too I've never understood the big deal around having the same name as a family member. I have two cousins with the same name and then my father, nephew, and brother all have the same name too plus my uncle and aunt who are married have the same name too.
