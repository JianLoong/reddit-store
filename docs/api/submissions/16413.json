Your edit doesn\u2019t really fix the main issue here.\n\nTalking about it when your grandmother passed is not the same as telling them that you wanted to use that name.\n\nIf you would have told them up front, and then they chose to steal the name. They would be TA. \n\nHowever in this case it doesn\u2019t appear you have made any real attempt during the pregnancy to tell them about the name. So why should they know?", "YTA. it's a name. the name Elizabeth is so common. It's not that deep.", "YTA. She announced her baby\u2019s name first. Perhaps you should have announced what your naming your child to your dad and stepmom so they don\u2019t pick the same name. But now they had it first and you should probably pick a different name. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but you can\u2019t claim the name Elizabeth, especially when someone announced that\u2019s their baby\u2019s name first. Sorry.", "YTA - why is your reason for choosing that name more valid than hers? You don\u2019t own a name and you didn\u2019t \u201cchoose it first\u201d .. she could have chosen it long ago", "NTA - just tell your dad that they\u2019ll have the same name but he won\u2019t know the difference cause they won\u2019t see each other and he won\u2019t see you.", "ESH - from a practical standpoint there are a bunch of different nicknames for Elizabeth - Liz, Beth, Lizzy, Libby, Lisabeth, Betsy, Bitsy, Elly, Eliza, Liza, El, there are more and y\u2019all could make up your own. You both have reasons for choosing the name, she didn\u2019t chose it after she heard it from you, your dad sucks for not having a meaningful conversation about it beyond \u201cour baby is due first we win\u201d also he may be wrong because babies are sometimes uncooperative about arriving on schedule. All that aside your reasons for naming your baby are no more or less valid than their reasons for naming their baby. \n\nAt any rate, for what it is worth, my middle kid has a fairly normal name that was still not often in use when she was born, not her real name but let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s Libby. Her BFF from age ten on was also named Libby. There was no confusion and our community called them \u201cThe Libbys\u201d. I hope that your daughter and her auntie have a long happy relationship that brings them joy, even if they have the same name.", "NTA if she and your father were fully aware that you were already intending to use that name.", "YTA, it's absurd to tell them they have to change the name they plan to use at this point, especially since they had no idea that there may have been a conflict. You do realize it's possible for 2 kids to share the same first name, even if they're related right?", "Ffs. BOTH OF YOU CAN USE THE NAME! \n\nIt literally won\u2019t matter that they have the same 1st name bc they\u2019ll both be going to school with 25 other Elizabeths and work with 17 more at each job they ever have. \n\nYou have nerve to be upset over one of the most traditional and common names to ever have existed in North America since the Victorian Era. It\u2019s not a special name, it\u2019s a name that has special meaning. \n\nTrust. There are 143.876 million other Elizabeths running around right this moment- and almost every single one of them was named after they Grandma. \n\nYTA.", "Eh, just make everyone happy and go NC with them. Your father would be too busy with his new kid to care about you and your kid anyway. He can wait another 20 years to become a grandfather to his new kid's children. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yta", "NTA", "Easy solution - whichever baby is born first gets Elisabeth as a first name and the second baby gets it as a middle name. Friend and grandmother are both honoured, aunt and niece don\u2019t share a first name", "Yta millions of ppl have that name", "My name is also Elizabeth Kathrine. Are you mad at my mom too?", "ESH. \n\nYour reason is not more important than hers and you don't own the name. Your dad is TA for saying they will use it first and you will \"have to\" pick something else. No you don't, you can both name your daughters Elizabeth and it will be fine.\n\nMy dad and his cousin are the same age and were *inseparable* until his cousin moved away after college, and they're still extremely close friends. They have the same first name, the same last name, and the same middle initial. It's only ever been a problem when my dad tried to buy them both plane tickets to go on a trip together and the airline couldn't understand that they were two different people and it wasn't a mistake or him trying to reserve two seats and they did actually need two boarding passes, thanks. And that was pretty easily resolved and they both thought it was hysterical.\n\nNo one was mad about their parents both using the same name. It wasn't an issue.  And their shared first name isn't one with a lot of nickname options--Elizabeth has so many! Even if they both want to be called Lizzie, it will STILL be fine. Name your kid what you want to name your kid and don't worry about what anyone else is naming theirs.", "NTA. Your dad knew and is pandering to his new and younger wife. Use the name you planned. They can get over it.", "YTA. Simple solution. Your elizabeth can have Eli, Elle, Beth, etc as a nickname. Their elizabeth will have lizzie. When the girls are around eachother, they can use their nicknames.", "YTA. Elizabeth is a very common name hence why it\u2019s not shocking both your grandma and her friend both had it. Your daughter will most likely have classes with other students named Elizabeth as well. It would be one thing if she heard you pick the name and then vindictively changed her kids name to that too but it\u2019s just a coincidence.", "My mother and her sister had children like 20 hours apart and named us both Katie. They had discussed it beforehand and were like yolo, it has made us so much more close than if we were born 20 bours apart with different names. YTA", "This is it. I DO get when people don\u2019t want a close family member to be given the same name as their child. I know it\u2019s very common but frankly it makes things confusing in conversation. However, at the end of the day, no one owns a name. You don\u2019t get to ban anyone from using a name anymore than a relative gets to demand you name your child after someone else. You can have disappointed feelings. You can share those feelings. But it\u2019s up to the other person how they respond to your feelings and concerns. \n\nPlease people, just stop telling others what you will name your child. That will eliminate someone else being inspired by you and \u201cstealing\u201d the same name. And it will stop people from telling you what you should/shouldn\u2019t name your child. Just tell everyone you haven\u2019t decided yet and stick to that story until baby is born.", "We decided not to announce her full name, but my dad knew I wanted to name my first born daughter Elizabeth as we discuss this after my gran passed.", "Exactly.  \n\nThis is how OP sounds: *I know you want to honor your dead friend and all, but I called dibs on the name \"Elizabeth\" so you can't use it.*", "Exactly. Frankly, when it comes to naming someone after people it\u2019s fine to have more than one in a family. It\u2019s also not exactly like Elizabeth is an uncommon name. This doesn\u2019t need to be an issue", "I had two grandfathers named Joe. Every other cousin of mine is named Joe.", "But also dad also can\u2019t claim the name either. Apparently there will be two Elizabeth\u2019s. Life goes on", "ESH, OP the most though. Her Dad told her that she will have to change her baby's name too since his daughter will be born first. Now he may not have said anything if OP hadn't brought it up.", "Actually I think the relationship is going to tank anyway. Dad told her that their baby will be born first so she'll have to pick something else! He's not going to accept that both babies have the same name. Neither will the stepmom.", "haha she has this name all her life for her first child and its not important?\n\nWho is tanking the relationship? The daughter who ever since she was a infant she had the name for her first child? or her dad, who knew it and now is trying to rob the dream of his own daughter? \n\nIts actually very simple to resolve this... going nc with the shitty dad who don't respect his daughter...", "Also, OP failed to call dibs first. It's absolutely laughable that they want someone to publicly retract the name they've chosen.\n\nIf this was so important to OP, they should have brought this up to their dad ASAP..regnant.", "Agreed. There were 25 people in my class, years 6-12. Five of us were named Elizabeth. We turned out fine.", "We decided not to announce her full name, but my dad knew I wanted to name my first born daughter Elizabeth as we discuss this after my gran passed.", "We decided not to announce her full name, but my dad knew I wanted to name my first born daughter Elizabeth as we discuss this after my gran passed.", "Elle's will be Lizzie. OP said so.", "We decided not to announce her full name, but my dad knew I wanted to name my first born daughter Elizabeth as we discuss this after my gran passed.", "Amen!", "But dad and his wife don't own it either.", "OP says they've had several text conversations about the name and that her father texted her after she found out she was having a girl whether she'd be using the nickname Lizzie or Beth so it seems like he definitely knew her plan and figured it was fine if he green lit Elizabeth nickname Lizzie for his wife since OP was only going to use the full name.", "No, gran was my mom's mom. They didn't have much of a relationship. They were civil because of me but that was it. He wanted me to have a relationship with her so there was a maternal figure in my life. Gran blamed him for my mom leaving and eventually passing, she was an addict and overdosed.", "i feel like your missing the part that op\u2019s dad only said that since op is so insistent someone (aka them) change their kids name.", "Agreed ESH. OP\u2019s demand is unreasonable, as is her dad for demanding the same thing.", "Sooo many Pattys, Pats and Patricias in my family too. And some of them weren't even first names but they still preferred to use them.", ">they need to get over it too\n\nthey didn\u2019t care, only op did. the only reason they brought op changing her kids name was bc op was so insistent.", "This is actually a really smart idea", "You wanting to honor your grandmother is no more important than her wanting to honor her friend.  You can't call dibs on a name, and you are being really insensitive to your stepmom.  As others have pointed out, there can absolutely be two people with the same name in the family.  Your dad and his wife are cool with that.  If you aren't, then you are the one that needs to make a change (Katherine Elizabeth, perhaps). If you don't want to make a change, that is your choice - but you cannot dictate what they name their baby.", "Your step mom has equal reasons to choose the name Elizabeth.  You've both lost someone dear to you.  Let it go and honour them both.  YTA", "So I am assuming it was his mother that passed and during that time you told him about the name and he was supposed to remember that? You could have said if it\u2019s a girl we are going with that name. But you didn\u2019t, so come to terms with a new name and use Elizabeth in the middle. Hey just flip yours to Katherine. Done!!! YTA.", "Do you know how many of us have said we\u2019ll name our kid after someone recently passed?  And then you forget or you like something better and want it as a middle name or you switch to *their* middle name and for a second you want to go unisex with their last name. Or, god forbid, their partner wants a different name. Or they call dibs on it and never use it. ALL OF US. \n\nPeople are not required to keep a list of baby names their friends and family have ever liked or mentioned liking or declared proprietary rights over.", "How long ago did your gran pass?", "Also OP: I know you can\u2019t read my mind and you are farther along in your pregnancy, but I called *silent* *invisible* dibs on the name, how *dare* you not read my mind and know it was saved!", "Reminds me of that scene in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, where they introduce all the cousins: Gus:\u00a0\"Welcome to my home. Over here is my brother, Ted, and his wife, Melissa, and their children, Anita, Diane and Nick. Over here, my brother Tommy, his wife Angie, and their children, Anita, Diane and Nick. And here, my brother George, his wife Freda, and their children, Anita, Diane and Nick. Taki, Sophie, Kari, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, uh, Nikki, and I am Gus.\"", "That was after she texted Elle and TOLD her to pick a different name.", "he only said that bc op is insisting they change their kids name. if op wants someone to change their kids name, she should be the one to do it.", "What exactly did Elle do to deserve being called an AH here?", "If he remembered, he obviously didn\u2019t think it would be an issue. I have several people named the same name in my family and we have no issue", "Sometimes, people forget things that aren't directly related to their own lives. My husband, for example, would never remember a conversation like that.", "Even if your dad did know, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that the name Elizabeth means something special to your stepmom and have just as much reason to use that name. Just make your peace with it. Apologize. But still name your daughter Elizabeth because it\u2019s okay to have 2 in the family", "How long ago was that?", "Unless your gran passed sometime in the last six months, you can't really hold people to a) remember, and b) assume that you didn't at some point change your mind with respect to conversations about naming a yet to be conceived fictional child.  You could have found a name you like more, your partner who is also the child's parent and gets a say may hate the name or the name could have some sort of traumatic trigger for them, you could end up dealing with infertility and not having children...and most importantly no one else actually cares about your picked out names cause people have better things going on in their lives.", "You think your father remember something that trivial?", "How often did you discuss this? Was it a quick brief conversation or you spoke about it multiple times?", "Nobody owns it.  Anyone can use it.  OP can use it, step mom can use it, 3 dozen random commenters can decide they\u2019re going to name their kid Elizabeth Katherine just because they want to.  It\u2019s a name.  It\u2019s fair game.", "Sorry, still YTA\n\nIf you wanted to \"reserve\" the name, then you needed to at least tell the other pregnant/expecting people in your life.", "That's not how I interpreted it so I'm sticking to my guns.", "I love that scene!", "All he had to say is they are not budging. It's that simple. That's why I said she's the biggest asshole.", "Sorry - that's not how I read it. He TOLD her she had to change the name after she asked them to change the name. And she did say had mentioned the name previously. This is an ESH.", "Yes, this.", "Several times. If I search the name elizabeth in our chat history it comes up in several different conversations that were had before the announcement. Including one from dad when I told him i was having a girl asking if she would be a lizzie or a Beth - the answer was neither as i don't like nicknames", "Love the movie!", "You're creating a problem where there isn't one.  You said in the post they are going to call their daughter Lizzie. Your daughter will be Elizabeth.  No more issue.", "Hmmmm okay so I can understand why this would bother you because you had conversations with your father about this before. But you still can\u2019t tell Elle she can\u2019t use it. Yes you told your Dad but you didn\u2019t talk about is with Elle and SHE is the one who has the important reasons for using the name. I know it will feel weird if your children have the same name but they will use different nicknames so I don\u2019t think there will be confusion. Elizabeth is a very common name, if was something super unique I think it would be a lil different", "If you are one of those parents who \"doesn't like nicknames\" and won't let your kid have a nickname by their own volition when they're old enough to choose, you're a massive asshole. \n\n\nSpoiler alert my mom was like that and it's one of the many reasons we don't talk anymore.", "I agree except her dad apparently told her she\u2019s got to name her kid something else. She of course doesn\u2019t but it sounds like an issue might still exist."]}
