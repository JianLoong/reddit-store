They will remember that even though they seem to live in a place known for its terrain that their dad didn't want to hike with them and spend that important time together. Kids are only young once and they remember more than we give them credit for. I'm not being dramatic, I am thinking of every post on this site about how growing up people remember not being chosen by their parents in small and large ways. \n\nHe isn't even splitting his time, which is fine and healthy, he never chooses to hike with his family, and always hikes with others, that is not great parent behavior.", "But he never does that baby hikes with his family, he just leaves them out.", "No I totally agree. In my second paragraph I specifically said that I have no way of knowing if he does other things with the kids and if he does then the hiking thing isn't as big a deal.", "Haha that's fair. I mean, you couldn't pay me to go hiking with young kids lol. Thankfully I don't have any reason to need to do that hopefully forever.", "[removed]", ">Sorry if that hurts your feelings.\n\nit doesn't.", "You are reaching so far you are in danger of falling out of the comments all together.", "Yeah actually going back I think you are right", "I agree so why are you choosing to spread toxic bs all over this page? \n\nI also find it funny that you only acknowledge one part of what I am saying. At this point, I agree, you are OP and you just want people to validate your toxic as hell ideologies. That's actually super gross. Not cool. Stop being a wet baguette.", "So, I'm still not sure what you disagree with. You do think there is evidence of something inappropriate going on? Or do you think that it's okay to assume something based on the lack of info included by OP?", "I'm not going to keep arguing with you.   It's not my job to refute anything - I made my judgement.  You're the one who has a problem with it here, not me.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "He isnt asking to do something crossing boundaries. Thats why you are reaching.", "INFO: are you saying his wife should get full control over how he spends the day? That doesn\u2019t make sense either"]}
