Staying in bed snoozing while your partner tries to sleep is really disrespectful. Waking up on the floor might teach her something.", "ESH. She should be more considerate. But, threatening to shove someone out of a bed is immature at best. Violence is not the answer. This sounds like an unhealthy relationship, and you sound like an angry person.", "NTA. I can see how this would be infuriating.", "YTA. So, your sleep routine must be obeyed and her sleep routine is subordinate? Why? \n\nShe's not alone in needing two alarms. She might try one of the gentle alarms that slowly increase volume until the actual prescribed time. But, don't kid yourself, the odds of finding someone who needs to get up exactly when you do, the way you do, is small. Learn a little compromise.", "NTA tell her to get smart watch and set it to vibrate problem solved", "I was literally in this exact same situation dude, down to her being a serial snoozer and me a sleep-maxer with one alarm.\n\nJust deal with it, go to bed earlier and maybe even wake up at the first one to make her breakfast, making it into a positive instead of a negative.", "NTA my partner does the same thing and it drives me crazy because he will not wake up for anything if I don\u2019t shake him awake. It\u2019s very stressful because it interrupts your sleep pattern and your brain is, well, not very happy when that happens; which might affect your mood the whole day. This can also have a serious impact on your relationship if you don\u2019t talk it through now and find different ways you can deal with this", "NTA!!!", "\u201cShe insists she likes the feeling of snoozing in the morning knowing she doesn\u2019t have to get up straight away\u201d\n\nDoes she like the feeling of having a boyfriend? Because this is no way to keep one.\n\nShe does have to get up straight away. Because she has a boyfriend who still needs another 1.5 hours of sleep. She should care about your needs too. She should be looking out for you and not just herself. \n\nThat should make it feel bad to snooze repeatedly and cost you sleep. If it doesn\u2019t - if she\u2019s comfortable disregarding you and focusing only on herself and justifying this like it\u2019s not terrible - I\u2019d leave.\n\nBut don\u2019t engage in physical abuse. That would turn it from NTA to ESH fast.", "NTA. Because she likes to snooze for up to 30 minutes she thinks it is OK to cost you you up to 2 HOURS of sleep? That is ridiculous, and totally selfish. \n\nYes, bump her out of bed. Make sure the night before that she has put together what she needs so she can just leave the bedroom and dress, letting you get the extra 90 minutes you need. \n\nOr Perhaps you should consider sleeping (actual sleep not cuddling time) in separate rooms on work nights. So she gets her snooze time and you do not get woken up.", "NTA - I agree with others that the 'shove out of bed' is out of line, but it is medically proven that snooze alarms are terrible for you ... so your GF is wrong and is hurting both of your health.", "Been there, done that and eventually we just started getting up together. I got a bit \u201cstabby\u201d because my partner would set multiple alarms to get up and snooze all the time. And it wasn\u2019t even for work, it was so he could get up early and ride on the weekends which made me more stabby. I set one alarm on weekdays when I had to get up for work and then on weekend he did his multiple annoying shit. During the week he ended up just getting up with me and on the weekends I told him he got two alarms and if he wasn\u2019t up I was turning off his phone. And I did. Problem solved. \n\nNTA because she is being inconsiderate of your sleep needs. It just rude of her to play that game.", "YTA. I feel like a lot of people have multiple alarms because they have hopes they'll get up early and start things. You would still be woken up early if the alarm was 30-45 minutes later.

Her snoozing wakes you up. What you\u2019re asking is reasonable; she can either set the alarm for later or she can get up when her alarm goes off", "NTA.

There are people needing exactly this - having multiple alarm and snoozy cycle. And then there are those who don't need them, can't go back to sleep after or just need the time to sleept longer. It is not fair. But it is hard if you are in a realtionship with someone who is the opposite of you in this matters\n\nHave you tried to talk to her about it? Tell her, that it is affecting you and you might can come op with a solution that works for you both. Is it possible for her to use an alarm you would not hear? Like something soft - or high frequency (as woman are sensitive to such tones). Maybe it will be possible for you to sleep through her alarms. If not. Maybe it is possible to get an agreement. That one week she can do her style with multiple alarms and one week she has to get out of bed at the first time her alarm goes of?

Sleep is just as important as food and oxygen.", "NTA but in the long run it is best to go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time. Source: I'm a night owl and my wife is an early riser.

Then you threatened to \u201cliterally shove her out of bed\u201d\u2026 Seriously?", "Finding someone who needs to get up exactly when you do vs finding someone who's courteous enough to only set one alarm are two different things.\n\nThere's mountains of data showing that hitting the snooze button isn't a good sleeping pattern. It generally puts you back into a deep sleep part of your cycle and then rips you out of it, leaving you groggier than waking up during any other part of your sleep cycle. Doing that to yourself is inadvisable, forcing that on another person makes you an asshole.", "Tell me you don't know what snoozing an alarm does without telling me...\n\nOp literally says they understand they will be woken up at times as it's part of living together.

My solution for a sleep disturber was a single bed in an alcove away from him, until we could afford a separate bedroom for me.", "Shoving a sleeping partner out of bed is a violent act in a relationship.
