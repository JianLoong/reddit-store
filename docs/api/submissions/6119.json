Do you want some closure with this dude? You don't have to see him to make nice, even if he is dying. This guy cultivated a shit relationship with you. If you want to forgive him, fine, go do so.

You're not entitled to anything. If that's the only reason why you're not talking to him, then get over that and have a good relationship. \n\nHe's TAH for how he handled that. No kidding parents aren't going to leave a lump sum to someone that is a cashier.

I\u2019m making some massive assumptions here, but based on his prior actions, I feel safe in making them. He does not care that he neglected you, made you feel unwanted, and then told you he was embarrassed by your teenage profession. There is something he wants.  It could be an eased conscience, a need to secure some sort of legacy, someone to look after some affair after he\u2019s gone, or maybe he wants money.  Who knows?
