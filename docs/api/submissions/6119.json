Do you want some closure with this dude? You don't have to see him to make nice, even if he is dying. This guy cultivated a shit relationship with you. If you want to forgive him, fine, go do so.

You're not entitled to anything. If that's the only reason why you're not talking to him, then get over that and have a good relationship. \n\nHe's TAH for how he handled that. No kidding parents aren't going to leave a lump sum to someone that is a cashier.

I\u2019m making some massive assumptions here, but based on his prior actions, I feel safe in making them. He does not care that he neglected you, made you feel unwanted, and then told you he was embarrassed by your teenage profession. There is something he wants.  It could be an eased conscience, a need to secure some sort of legacy, someone to look after some affair after he\u2019s gone, or maybe he wants money.  Who knows?

You keep mulling over this because you feel guilty. Hear what he has to say and lay it to rest once and for all. You seem smart enough to recognize a hustle. It will give you an opportunity to finally say to him what you've wanted to say to him. Really tell him how you feel.", "Yeah it was tough. That first night I had no where to go so parked my car at the end of the airport runway that was a quiet make-out spot and crawled in back and fell asleep.\n\nIt the middle of the night the cops woke me up wanting to know what I was doing there. \"I had a fight with my Dad!\". They tried to convince me I wasn't safe there, but I said I've got y'all to watch over me, so they let me go back to sleep.\n\nAnyway I get it. There actually were a couple times my Dad got physically abusive with me, but the night of my departure I evened the score, so that helped him to at least see I had become a man. Something he could understand.\n\nAnyway, I'm not going to pretend to know your particular circumstances, so just do whatever you think is best for you to put this whole mess behind you.", "If it will hurt you in any way even emotionally DO NOT DO IT. You do not owe him anymore of you than he has already gotten.", "I just want to emphasize that it\u2019s not unusual for a child of abuse, and in your case I understand it was neglect/ emotional, to mourn or keep\ntrying to get the parental relationship they never had. Your father may be seeking to ease his own conscience, but make sure you\u2019re not going into it seeking something your father is incapable of giving; caring and respect, and setting yourself up for further hurt.", "[deleted]", "For some people they take it well \"oh he's dead? Whatever.\" For some they start to question it \"damn I wonder what he would've said if I had asked him why, did he even really care?

He will be dead either way (most likely).  You don't have to accept an amends from him (if that is what he wants).  It could be your last chance to tell him about the impact his parenting had on you.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to a counselor about what you would say to him.  This is an important decision for you and your life.", "[deleted]", "Focusing on the will is what is making you the AH. If your reasoning for being no contact with your dad was because he's a living embodiment of a sewage treatment facility then you'd not be the AH.\n\nBut you're focus on the will is overly materialistic.\n\nContact, don't contact, that's your choice, but make sure it's a reason you can live with. Sometimes \"because fuck him that's why\" is just a good enough reason.", "Well, the more you know.", "Even if he did want that which I cannot verify, I am also a drinker, so my liver is probably not squeaky clean either.", "Note that it's much harder for an alcoholic to qualify for a liver transplant because, not surprisingly, they want to know you'll be compliant in taking your antirejection meds and not returning to your old ways that will just end up destroying your new liver.    \n\n\nIf you can offer evidence that you've achieved a significant recovery, life style stable and all that, you might qualify, but they're not going to commit to a huge outlay of medical costs (and that will be ongoing for the rest of your life), you're out of luck.", "Or he has liver cancer and realised he damaged his relationship with a potential donor match.", "Maybe you can encourage op to actually talk to him to get the truth instead of speculating his lies", "I don\u2019t think it changes people.  I think it scares people.  They\u2019re scared of what comes next knowing they\u2019ve done bad shit to other people.  They\u2019re scared of being sent to whatever hell they believe in.  Assuming they aren\u2019t athiest that is.  And even then, they just want it off their conscience.  They want to offload their bad feelings onto someone else so they feel like they haven\u2019t done wrong\u2014when they absolutely know they have.", "I suppose so.", "I don't really know, I feel like I have this weird emotional feeling where I want to have a better relationship with those I really hate.

I still don't really know man, it's been tough.", "No, that\u2019s not necessarily true.  It\u2019s totally possible to feel no regret when your abuser dies.  As in nada, zip, not one scintilla.  It\u2019s totally possible to feel overwhelming relief and even joy.", "If I don't go, I probably wont regret it, I'd just have this bittersweet feeling or illusion of what would've happened if I did go.", "I think that the will and then his reasoning behind it was the final straw for OP it\u2019s not just about the will but that is what pushed him over the edge.

He may need a donor and his first born is now valuable.", "Maybe write a letter about what you would say to him and show it to your counselor.  After you write it down, you might have a better idea if you want to see your dad or not.  I feel certain your feelings aren't only about the will, that is just the icing on the cake of all the crummy things he has done.", "Agree with \"No, that's not necessarilly true\" I mean yea, we all works different from each others and all stories are different too.\nWhat I was trying to say was; If you want, try to reconnect with him.
