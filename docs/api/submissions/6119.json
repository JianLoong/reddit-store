I\u2019m making some massive assumptions here, but based on his prior actions, I feel safe in making them. He does not care that he neglected you, made you feel unwanted, and then told you he was embarrassed by your teenage profession. There is something he wants.  It could be an eased conscience, a need to secure some sort of legacy, someone to look after some affair after he\u2019s gone, or maybe he wants money.  Who knows?

It\u2019s very easy to advise to don\u2019t contact him as that\u2019s quite a logical response and you would be right not to if that\u2019s how you feel, but you know you best and you need to base your decision on your own personality and feelings. Do what suits you best. As I said you don\u2019t owe him anything, your decision needs to be what will give you the most closure and peace of mind.", "NTA \n\nI had a similar experience when I was about 20 with my biological father. He spent my entire life avoiding me and paying child support until for some reason decided to reconnect when I was 18. It didn't last long mostly because he was pressuring me too much with his daddy dearest instructions to me. When I was 20 I needed help with money for school and asked him for some help but he told me I was a bad person and cut me out entirely. Seriously, he was hoping for me to make some kind of wrong step as an excuse.\n\nHe died about a year ago and I only found out a few months ago after looking at [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) for something else. It felt hollow and kind of awful all at once. Never received an official word from my stepmother or half sibling.", "My father also didn\u2019t want children and was way too young and immature when he had me. \n\nI cut off all contact and fully distanced myself emotionally when I was in high school. Figured, my mother raised me on her own, she gave everything for me. He wasn\u2019t even present and all he ever did is make me feel unhappy. No one needs that in their life. \n\nI reconnected with him by my own desire, of my own initiative, when I was in my early twenties. By then he was a lot more mature, had raised two other children and had a vastly different perspective on things. He got to know me as an adult. We have a very good relationship now and I\u2019m glad. \n\nBut, you see, this was MY choice. My decision. I wasn\u2019t coerced into it, and, quite honestly, it probably wouldn\u2019t have been possible to force me even if someone tried. And just the same, it should be your decision and your choice.\n\nSo no, NTA. Your life, your choice. A relationship is a two way street.

IMO, no matter how hurt your feelings are, you should do your father the kindness and grace of allowing him to leave the world with one less regret. It won't hurt or harm you to do so, and even if you could argue he doesn't deserve it, we could all use to choose kindness more often. I think you should choose kindness because I believe that karma will come back to you in the end, and because you NEVER get a re-do. Do you have any family you can call to confirm he does have The Big C and isn't manipulating you?", "Search your heart and do whatever would leave you with the least regrets. \n\nYou don't owe your father anything at this point, and certainly not absolution, but perhaps you owe it to yourself to see what he has to say after all this time. \n\nIf you do hear him out, please keep in mind that whatever he has to say will be from his perspective, and is not about *you*, even if he says something hurtful to you. He has to live with whatever mentality he has, and if it's a negative one, hopefully you can pity him.\n\nIt's not bad of him to reach out, and actually brave of him to try.

As their kids grew up and had kids of their own, the now grandparents, many times now in much more secure circumstances, have become very attentive to their grandkids - in effect, they are much better grandparents than they ever were parents. Was your dad TA? Maybe. Are you the AH? No. Aside from the inheritance, is it worthwhile to reconnect with him? Only you can decide that, but for both your sakes, try to remove any lingering resentment over his will. It can only get in the way of any chance of reconciliation.

I don't know the answer, but based on what you've said, I'm going to make the reasonable assumption that he would've continued to ignore your existence.\n\nI'm trying very hard to separate my own experience with my father as there's some real similarities, like being a father in name only for example. He decided to contact me after a health scare and I did end up meeting him and it was a total waste of time. He was more interested in playing the blame game and making small talk than he was actually having a meaningful conversation. He even went so far as to blame my mother, who raised me on her own, for his inability to be a parent. So yeah I definitely regretted giving him the time of day.\n\nNow just because that's my experience, does not mean that it will go that way with you OP.
