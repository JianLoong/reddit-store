He's the one who accused you.\n\nHe wants you to apologize for taking him at his word and responding!? Just no.", "NTA.  You grocked your brother correctly.", "NTA! You appropriately assessed that his perspective \u201cmy son USED TO BE cool\u201d is a negative way to view his kid reading.

And if he's that easily strained, then he's likely not doing well as a parent. You rightfully called him out for it. \n\nIt's one thing if he sought your help with the situation, but you're blameless here. You gave a kid a book. And he enjoyed it. You now have something to bond over. And I can assure you, if you maintain his love for it, his life will be infinitely better for it. Hopefully he can continue his love for sports too, but this was a great growth opportunity for him that will pay off in the long run.", "NTA. Rather than support his sons interests he dismissing having anything outside of sports. What year is this, jeez? It\u2019s sad and pathetic to have this viewpoint. He is no better. What if his son heard what he said to you? Way to tear down his sons self esteem. What\u2019s to stop him from saying such a thing to his son when he\u2019s distressed again?

Like hell, the nerdy athletes in my high school were the most popular kinds in the grade, mainly because they had an easy time getting on with everyone, your nephew has he potential to have a great time at high school, and it sucks that both his dad, and some of his classmates ate trying to ruin that for him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You hit a nerve.  I'm not sure you actually need to apologise explicitly because you needed to say what you did because you had no reason to not take his words at face value because they did come out of his mouth.  It may be what you said is why he's reflected on the content and realised he's a dick but there's that element of not wanting you to think badly of him and now he's justifying those words.\n\nIt will be far better if the two of you sit down and brainstorm about what the next step is to help your nephew.\n\nThere may need to be a chat with the teacher to nip this in the bud - needs to be done when they see it because being a dibber dobber doesn't always go down well.
