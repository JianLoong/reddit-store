He owes not only you an apology but his son too", "NTA. If your bother said awful things that he didn't mean because he was distressed, then he should be the one to apologize. He's the one who accused you.\n\nHe wants you to apologize for taking him at his word and responding!? Just no.", "NTA.  You grocked your brother correctly.", "NTA! You appropriately assessed that his perspective \u201cmy son USED TO BE cool\u201d is a negative way to view his kid reading. (Which omg reading is a good thing!)", "NTA, he was trying to spin it back around cause he got caught being an AH.", "NTA \n\nYou are right. \n\nYour brother is the same as the bullies and is judging his son for reading a damn book!", "Sorry this seems pretty fake.", "NTA. Is your son a mental 12 year old?", "NTA keep encouraging him to enjoy the things he likes bullies be dammed.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nHe literally said what he said, thought about it and changed his mind because he realized what an asshole he was. He literally has the same mentality \u201c he\u2019s not cool because he reads books. Tell him, an apology would be nice and maybe he should try to spend some time with his son and get him into therapy.", "NTA. His stress doesn't justify his blaming you for his son's situation. And if he's that easily strained, then he's likely not doing well as a parent. You rightfully called him out for it. \n\nIt's one thing if he sought your help with the situation, but you're blameless here. You gave a kid a book. And he enjoyed it. You now have something to bond over. And I can assure you, if you maintain his love for it, his life will be infinitely better for it. Hopefully he can continue his love for sports too, but this was a great growth opportunity for him that will pay off in the long run.", "NTA. Rather than support his sons interests he dismissing having anything outside of sports. What year is this, jeez? It\u2019s sad and pathetic to have this viewpoint. He is no better. What if his son heard what he said to you? Way to tear down his sons self esteem. What\u2019s to stop him from saying such a thing to his son when he\u2019s distressed again? He\u2019s just angry because he knows you are right.", "NTA", "NTA, jesus this shit was going out of fashion 10-15 years ago when i was at that age, imagine being this much of an 80's-90's throw back that you think reading rather than playing sports makes you uncool. And hell, it sounds like the kid is still playing sport as well! Like hell, the nerdy athletes in my high school were the most popular kinds in the grade, mainly because they had an easy time getting on with everyone, your nephew has he potential to have a great time at high school, and it sucks that both his dad, and some of his classmates ate trying to ruin that for him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
