I tried to give her some hotline numbers she could call but she says they don't answer or don't help much.\n\nI'm struggling to make ends meet right now and really can't afford to support her and I've been repeatedly telling her as much but she never listened. So I told her the next time she feels a panic attack coming or like she's not feeling well to call 911 instead of me because I can't help and that's what I'll be doing if she calls me again, to call the police.\n\nShe was very upset and questioned whether I didn't care what would happen to her custody case if it got to court that she's having mental health struggles. Her husband she's currently divorcing is emotionally abusive so she doesn't feel at ease leaving her children with him.\n\nI told her I did care but literally unable to help her and if I could, I would. I told her again to stop calling during emegencies because I can't do anything. She said she didn't need me to do anything in particular and just be there but I told her I can't be there for her in any way, not even just listening. \n\nShe said she should just stay with her husband since everybody is treating her like a burden (referring to my other sister refusing to let her live with her after the divorce). I told her that's not what I meant (being a burden) and she got even more upset and accused me of using her and hung up.\n\nNow I feel like a big asshole but for real, I can barely make ends meet and severely depressed myself and in therapy for it.

I don\u2019t think you know how bad the police treat you when you\u2019re mentally ill. They psychically grapple you, throw you into the nearest institution (for my sister, it was devro, very bad place), and often times these institutions are very underfunded, traumatizing and dirty places. They don\u2019t care if your insurance covers it and yes you will probably be billed like 900 dollars afterwards. And yes this is also what happens if you sign yourself in or call an ambulance. I don\u2019t know what rock you live under, but psych wards are traumatizing places. No, you don\u2019t owe your sister constant emotional support. That can be incredibly exhausting. But suggesting she call the police instead of just..being less selfish and listening for a FEW DAYS until she speaks to a therapist? Jesus Christ.

I have a friend who will dump on me whenever she is going through things, we're besties and I feel like that's what I'm here for. Unfortunately her recent struggles are all major triggers for me and my ptsd, I don't have the emotional bandwidth to constantly hear and deal with it though I try. Without setting boundaries which are healthy, I'm doing more damage to my own well being. It's gotten to the point where I'm just numb and unempathetic, which is bad for both of us! I'm not saying she can't come to me, but I've limited how much. I'm still there for her but in a way healthy for both of us and our relationship. Now on the other hand. I absolutely refuse to reach out to anyone while I'm in crisis, for fear of being a burden, judgement, bothering people, having my problems used against me. I've called my bestie exactly once while in crisis, it made her feel wanted and needed. That's how bad I am about asking for help, she mentioned how I'm always there for her but never let anyone in. I am in therapy and it's still a struggle, my therapist says it's important to build a support system around myself, people I can trust and go to when a problem arises or even before. My ex husband was emotionally and mentally abusive and used my mental illness against me and tried to use it in court to gain full custody of my son. He'd even purposely trigger me then call the police and have me shipped off to the mental ward. The police aren't equipped to handle mental health crisis, especially if isn't not detrimental and even then they really aren't. Crisis hotlines are honestly hit or miss, they can be pretty bad. It's taken me years to be able to call and I've had some bad experiences which put me off. Reaching out for help can be so incredibly hard for people suffering with mental illness and you make her feel safe. I'm not saying don't set boundaries because that can be dangerous for both of you, but maybe find a way to limit it in a healthy way. I don't think she's trying to manipulate you or anyone, I think she's in such a dark place that she's drowning and doesn't know what to do and is spiraling and feeling out of control. Maybe if she finds some small things she does have control over and focus on that, it'll help. I hope she gets into therapy soon, though that will take some time.

It might help to go low-contact for a bit to give yourself some time and space to breathe & to really reinforce that boundary, it\u2019s not easy - but it was the only way I could get my mom to stop with me. This situation definitely sucks and is kind of a sad reality of life when people don\u2019t take better care of themselves mentally & emotionally. \n\nRegardless of her upcoming custody case - your sister really should seek out professional therapeutic help &/or at least medication for her anxiety.
