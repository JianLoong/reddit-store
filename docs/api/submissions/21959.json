So I told her the next time she feels a panic attack coming or like she's not feeling well to call 911 instead of me because I can't help and that's what I'll be doing if she calls me again, to call the police.\n\nShe was very upset and questioned whether I didn't care what would happen to her custody case if it got to court that she's having mental health struggles. Her husband she's currently divorcing is emotionally abusive so she doesn't feel at ease leaving her children with him.\n\nI told her I did care but literally unable to help her and if I could, I would. I told her again to stop calling during emegencies because I can't do anything. She said she didn't need me to do anything in particular and just be there but I told her I can't be there for her in any way, not even just listening. \n\nShe said she should just stay with her husband since everybody is treating her like a burden (referring to my other sister refusing to let her live with her after the divorce). I told her that's not what I meant (being a burden) and she got even more upset and accused me of using her and hung up.\n\nNow I feel like a big asshole but for real, I can barely make ends meet and severely depressed myself and in therapy for it.

Unfortunately her recent struggles are all major triggers for me and my ptsd, I don't have the emotional bandwidth to constantly hear and deal with it though I try. Without setting boundaries which are healthy, I'm doing more damage to my own well being. It's gotten to the point where I'm just numb and unempathetic, which is bad for both of us! I'm not saying she can't come to me, but I've limited how much. I'm still there for her but in a way healthy for both of us and our relationship. Now on the other hand. I absolutely refuse to reach out to anyone while I'm in crisis, for fear of being a burden, judgement, bothering people, having my problems used against me. I've called my bestie exactly once while in crisis, it made her feel wanted and needed. That's how bad I am about asking for help, she mentioned how I'm always there for her but never let anyone in. I am in therapy and it's still a struggle, my therapist says it's important to build a support system around myself, people I can trust and go to when a problem arises or even before. My ex husband was emotionally and mentally abusive and used my mental illness against me and tried to use it in court to gain full custody of my son. He'd even purposely trigger me then call the police and have me shipped off to the mental ward. The police aren't equipped to handle mental health crisis, especially if isn't not detrimental and even then they really aren't. Crisis hotlines are honestly hit or miss, they can be pretty bad. It's taken me years to be able to call and I've had some bad experiences which put me off. Reaching out for help can be so incredibly hard for people suffering with mental illness and you make her feel safe. I'm not saying don't set boundaries because that can be dangerous for both of you, but maybe find a way to limit it in a healthy way. I don't think she's trying to manipulate you or anyone, I think she's in such a dark place that she's drowning and doesn't know what to do and is spiraling and feeling out of control. Maybe if she finds some small things she does have control over and focus on that, it'll help. I hope she gets into therapy soon, though that will take some time.

As someone who has dealt with mental illness in my family (self included) and friend group, I can see both sides. But the truth is that the US medical system is so fucked and hard to navigate, especially if someone is crippled by panic or mental illness.  It is not as easy as the replys in this thread are making it seem (i.e. she is an adult, needs to put on big girl panties, there are plenty of resource for leaving abusive relaships so family help isn't actually needed, etc).\n\nEach person and relationship is different, but have learned a few things to help myself and the people in my life. Sharing in case it is of help to any one reading:\n\n- if someone is in crisis, they often need actual psychiatric help, not an appointment with a therapist. Stop the fire first with medication and then also do therapy and/or work to solve the structural problems in life.\n\n- If they work for an employer who is subject to FMLA, let your loved one know about that. So many people do not know that they could potentially take a temporary FMLA leave for anxiety/panic disorder. \n\n- Really think through how you can support loved ones without burning out. It is usually not all or nothing and each relationship is different. Perhaps that could look like a scheduled weekly call, short texts, even being together in the same space but without talking. Letting the person know you are also struggling and need your own space and time is ok. Compassionate communicating is key. \n\n\n\nAnd this next section is totally in the weeds, so i am sticking it at the end in case anyone is still reading.\n\nI would encourage a person in mental health crisis to try to establish psychiatric care within their existing health system. However, getting an initial appointment can take months and is really frustrating. If possible, ask to be put on waiting or call list in case someone cancels. \n\nWalk-in behavioral/ mental health care can be an alternative. Some clinics or community health centers provide walk-in services on certain days/times. Some hospitals in your area may have walk-in centers specifically for mental health, with the appropriate staff/teams. However, just going to any old ER is not usually a great experience and can be super traumatic, so some basic reasearch goes a long way. And definitely don't call the cops. \n\nOne way I have found to help loved ones navigate this all this is to spend time with the person while I initially call clinics to see if I can get them in to see someone asap and/or sort out insurance. I'll turn the phone over to the family member/friend as needed. That way they learn how one navigates the system and have buy-in and are therefor more likely to follow through.", "Completely agree.

OP, I think something you could do for her is compile a list of resources (this doesn\u2019t need to be extensive but could even just be a quick Google search). If there are numbers in your area she could call, even just providing her with some support (or numbers to places that could provide her some support) could still show her you\u2019re there for her while reinforcing that you aren\u2019t the one to maintain her emotional well-being because it\u2019s coming at the expense of your own.

No two people are the same, and while you might deal with your depression one way, to me it sounds like she just wants to know she's loved, wanted and that she's important to you in that moment.

She just wants a friend/loved one who can listen so she doesn't feel so isolated.\n\n\nSure, it's healthy to create boundaries, and I do think you need some here.
