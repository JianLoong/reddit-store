The problem is that she's been calling me a lot lately expressing she's having a panic attack or not feeling well.\n\nI tried to get her the medical attention she needed but these appointments wouldn't happen until a few days later or a week later. When she calls, she needs help in that moment. I tried to give her some hotline numbers she could call but she says they don't answer or don't help much.\n\nI'm struggling to make ends meet right now and really can't afford to support her and I've been repeatedly telling her as much but she never listened. So I told her the next time she feels a panic attack coming or like she's not feeling well to call 911 instead of me because I can't help and that's what I'll be doing if she calls me again, to call the police.\n\nShe was very upset and questioned whether I didn't care what would happen to her custody case if it got to court that she's having mental health struggles. Her husband she's currently divorcing is emotionally abusive so she doesn't feel at ease leaving her children with him.\n\nI told her I did care but literally unable to help her and if I could, I would. I told her again to stop calling during emegencies because I can't do anything. She said she didn't need me to do anything in particular and just be there but I told her I can't be there for her in any way, not even just listening. \n\nShe said she should just stay with her husband since everybody is treating her like a burden (referring to my other sister refusing to let her live with her after the divorce). I told her that's not what I meant (being a burden) and she got even more upset and accused me of using her and hung up.\n\nNow I feel like a big asshole but for real, I can barely make ends meet and severely depressed myself and in therapy for it.

You have to look out for your own mental health too.\n\nHaving said that YTA for telling her to call 911. The correct way to address a panic attack isn't to have emergency services send a bunch of guys with guns to your house. There's a million crisis call centers out there, get her the number for one of those. I'm sure you didn't intend it this way but \"Call 911\" for a *panic attack* comes off unbelievably callous.\n\nEdit: I missed that you did give her crisis numbers. Either way, \"Call 911\" is a callous thing to say and YTA for that part, I stand by that.\n\nHonestly an intervention may be most appropriate, find a good therapist who's willing to help stage one and convince your sister to go to therapy regularly and potentially see if she can find a medication that works for her.", "NAH, I feel like you've been trying your best to help and have helped a lot, but your out of emotional bandwidth to support yourself and your sister - it's ok. You have to look after yourself first. \n\nA heard a quote of \"a drowning man will pull you into the water to try to save themselves\" and it sounds like that's what your sister is doing to you at the moment.

It must be regional? Or maybe policy related too?", "I bet its a city to city thing, the police only show up if its needed which makes sense to me what are they going to do if I called 911 because somebody is passed out thats not a police matter. \n\nHowever I have seen in another city in my state where a police officer has revived a choking child because they got there before the ambulance and then the paramedics took over."]}
