She sounds like she's holding a grudge against him, but you're refusing to say why. But you're determined to make her look like the asshole, so you're leaving out important information.", "INFO: why was your sister so angry at your father before he died? You said she broke his heart but it's hard to understand why she did it when you refuse to say what she did.", "INFO: there is no way that we can answer this without knowing what she did (as a child!) To make him cut her off. I feel a lot of sympathy for your sister, though who sounds like she just wanted to be really close to your dad and because she did a thing that you haven't told us about she wasn't allowed that.", "INFO needed:\nCan't say, unless you share how she \"broke his heart\". There was a similar post some days ago where the parent and OP ended up just being homophobic bigots, so more info is needed.", "INFO what did she do? Did she come out as lesbian and your family is homophobic?", "INFO; you don't have to into huge detail but a general sense of what she did to break your dad's heart is needed here for context . Your dad might have been awful and this treatment is unjustified , and that changes everything . The fact that you won't say suggests this might be the case", "NTA: agree with your mum she needed to hear it.

Your father said, \"NO.\" She should respect his last wishes/decisions.

You reminding her of that, when's she's acting like an entitled brat, makes her uncomfortable but again - her actions have consequences. Your mom agreed she needed to hear it so you are in the clear.  She asked your dad directly for the journals and was told no, so she 100% should NOT be given the originals against your dad's wishes now that he's gone.
