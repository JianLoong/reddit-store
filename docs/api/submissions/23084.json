To give the hosts certainty in how many people they are dealing with. \n\nTo what extent you keep in touch with your family or isolate yourself is up to you, but by failing to even recognise it was your brothers wedding weekend, to have sent a message of congratulations, and - yes - to have failed to RSVP is way out on the extreme end of not giving a shit, rather than simply being introverted.", "YTA. It's rude to not even respond to an invite. RSVP means you tell them if you can or cannot go. I don't understand why you wouldn't even give them the barest courtesy to tell them you wouldn't attend. \n\nClose or not, weddings and funerals are the one time family shows up for one another. It's not weird they would have assumed you would go, especially since you didn't tell them otherwise. Next time you get an invite, have the decency to actually decline it. Wtf.", "YTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t respond to let him know you weren\u2019t coming and it\u2019s your brother so you could\u2019ve at least called him up to explain why you can\u2019t attend \n\nAlso you never know when some day you might need your family, I get you live far away but it\u2019s not hard to maintain a positive relationship and at least do the bare minimum to let them know you still care about them, you don\u2019t have to it\u2019s up to you but not everyone is lucky enough to have a family, you might regret it one day", "Yta it\u2019s not hard to say no you\u2019re not coming", "YTA. Attend or don\u2019t attend, but you don\u2019t just ignore *ignore*a wedding invitation. There\u2019s not making an effort and then there\u2019s being downright rude.", "You give a bad name to introverts everywhere. \n\nStop blaming your introverted personality and actually own that you're just an AH. You could have easily just RVSP no and said that you had to work. \n\nYou don't want to have a relationship with your family or apparently anyone, fine. But own it, and be kind about it. \n\n>I maybe talk with my parents once a month to see if someone is dead.\n\nI don't really know why, you seem to not care about anyone and probably won't go to their funeral anyway.", "YTA you can be introverted and still have good manners", "YTA. I'm so confused, you said nothing about WHY you are not close with your family other than you're an introvert and don't live nearby. Those are terrible reasons to cut off your family, IMO. I have a huge family and all of them live close together except me and my husband who moved across the country. But I'm still close with them - call them, show up for important events when I can travel. The fact that you saw ZERO value in attending your own brother's wedding is astounding to me. But then to not even give him the courtesy of a phone call to explain why you chose not to attend? Even more astounding. One day you may regret isolating yourself so much. It's your choice, at the end of the day, but it sounds like your family loves you and are just trying to understand why you don't want to be around them.", "YTA\n\nWow, you're incredibly rude. Silence in response to an invitation from a close relative that you haven't fallen out with is not acceptable. You can and should say no if you're not attending. The fact that you rarely speak to them probably meant they assumed you wouldn't reply but would just show up.\n\nIf you want to be left entirely alone by the world, that's up to you - and you've probably helped ensure that your family will drop you completely after this stunt. But you still need to RSVP to your *brother* about his *wedding*. Don't weaponise being an introvert to excuse just plain rudeness.", "YTA. We get it you don\u2019t care about anyone but yourself, no you are not just introverted you are uncaring, the two are not in any way the same. \n\nEven kindergarteners know you answer a rsvp or else you are a ass.", "YTA. \n\nYou should have at least called your brother to let him know that you won't be attending his wedding. That's a common courtesy and a sign of respect. You can't just ignore an invitation and expect him to understand. \n\nHe probably felt hurt and rejected by your silence. You also sent a gift without any personal message or explanation, which is very impersonal and cold. \n\nYou don't have to be close with your family, but you should still communicate with them when they invite you to important events.", "yta, yeah you really did mess up. that little \u201cphone call\u201d with your brother where you just abruptly hung up after saying \u201chey why wait up\u201d was very rude and you really could\u2019ve called your brother and it would\u2019ve been more sincere and they probably would\u2019ve understood. saying you aren\u2019t close to your family is no excuse, im not close with my mother by any means but still find the time of day to tell her happy mother\u2019s day. you can give a two second explanation \u201chey can\u2019t come i\u2019m working on a project and can\u2019t leave.\u201d \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. You don't care about your family? Fine. Newsflash it is a common courtesy to reply to an RSVP, especially a wedding.  But you couldn't be bothered to take a couple of seconds to reply no. Yes, you effed up royally.", "YTA. Not rsvping was extremely rude. You could have texted or emailed.  \n\nThey might not have presumed an average guest was coming, but you are his brother. So yeah, I would probably assume you were attending cos you're family.", "YTA. I'm an introvert who went to school on a separate continent and am still close to my. Family even though I now live 2000 miles from them (I'm back on the same continent though).  This isn't you being an introvert, this is you being an uncaring asshole.  RSVP is for saying whether or not you will attend. You're presumably an adult so you should have learned that extremely basic thing by now. Also,  how hard would it have been to just pop your brother a text saying \"hey, sorry but I can't come\". I mean Jesus you're an asshole.", "Yes YTA, also just plain rude. Common decency dictates you at least respond because it sounds like you might not be close to them but they still care about you.", "There\u2019s a difference between being introverted and just being rude.
