It's rude to not even respond to an invite. RSVP means you tell them if you can or cannot go. I don't understand why you wouldn't even give them the barest courtesy to tell them you wouldn't attend. \n\nClose or not, weddings and funerals are the one time family shows up for one another.

I'm so confused, you said nothing about WHY you are not close with your family other than you're an introvert and don't live nearby. Those are terrible reasons to cut off your family, IMO. I have a huge family and all of them live close together except me and my husband who moved across the country. But I'm still close with them - call them, show up for important events when I can travel. The fact that you saw ZERO value in attending your own brother's wedding is astounding to me. But then to not even give him the courtesy of a phone call to explain why you chose not to attend? Even more astounding. One day you may regret isolating yourself so much. It's your choice, at the end of the day, but it sounds like your family loves you and are just trying to understand why you don't want to be around them.", "YTA\n\nWow, you're incredibly rude. Silence in response to an invitation from a close relative that you haven't fallen out with is not acceptable. You can and should say no if you're not attending.

It might also improve your work-life. \n\nIt is also quite striking that you consider everyone in your family to be extremely extroverted and you are seemingly the EXTREME opposite?

Also i am curious: do you keep any contactat all? Or do you want to cut all contact with your family? The Singular Focus on books is also quite striking. \nEdit: do you have any desire to meet people or have friends at all?

Weddings usually have a pretty significant family significance, and if you\u2019re in regular contact with your parents, I\u2019m sure your parents would have expected you to be there.\n\nThe point is, at an event where your absence would be blatantly conspicuous, you should communicate to the hosts that you do not plan to attend. \n\n> and it was the time when I had to go home because our grandfather has died and his will was distributed.

I hope you RSVP\u2019d to those weddings, even if you weren\u2019t attending. You\u2019re an adult.

That is just common courtesy. If you did not want to attend you did not have to but the RSVP needed to be sent. Good for sending a gift. NTA for not being in close contact with the family.

While i agree OP probably should have been more assertive about not coming, there was plenty of opportunity for family to ask especially if leading up to the date his RSVP hadn't arrived. What a lot of people in this thread seem to forget is communication is a two way street and if they really wanted to confirm his presence they had plenty of opportunity to do so.

It sounds like OP is more than capable of completely disregarding his family\u2019s communication. \n\nFrom the sounds of things, he only registered their upset reaction this time because of the sheer volume of notifications, and the fact that someone mentioned to him in a in-person conversation that he was tagged in stuff on social media about it. The fact that multiple relatives tried multiple ways to reach him really says something. OP never mentioned that they made a habit of this, which makes me wonder if his no-show and then lack of response while in the field caused his family to become upset and/or concerned to the point that he was receiving repeated calls, emails, texts, social media pings, etc.\n\nOP definitely should have at least RSVP\u2019s no, ideally with some kind of explanation.", "Similar to another comment, respectfully please see a psychiatrist.

And not everyone enjoys that stuff because of family.\n\nSay if OP had never gotten the invitation in the first place, how would OP know to respond.  It DOES and CAN happen, especially with technology.  Would they still be an AH.  Absolutely not.\n\nI agree that OP is TA for not responding 'no' to the RSVP, but NO ONE should automatically presume no response is a 'yes' either.

Granted, one group of friends I invited lived quite far from where the party was so I knew it was a stretch, but I wanted to be nice and make them feel included. I gave them all their invites in person and they all seemed excited, with a couple saying, \"I can't guarantee anything, but hopefully!\". A few said right from the get-go that they had other commitments on the date (they definitely did, they weren't lying) so that saved some trashed invites. From the rest of the group, only ONE person RSVP'd, and it was a no only because she was a nurse and couldn't get that day off.\n\nAs for my family, almost everyone who was invited RSVP'd either way, except for one relative and his son who were going through a rough time and are often flaky with us when we invite them to the house.\n\nI find it rude to not respond at all to an RSVP, and my mother agreed.

There is no other interpretation of this. That\u2019s what it means.\n\nThat\u2019s literally why they put \u201cRSVP\u201d on the invitation.

Yes it\u2019s a \u201cpresumed no,\u201d but what if you get like 50 \u201cpresumed no\u201d and like six of them show up? This *happens.* And the hosts usually end up paying extra money on \u201cjust in case\u201d provisions because people couldn\u2019t be bothered to tick \u201cyes or no\u201d on an invitation.\n\nIf you get one that says \u201cRSVP by [date]\u201d and you don\u2019t RSVP by that date, then your invitation would be considered rescinded or no longer valid by default because they have officially not provisioned for you. But many don\u2019t do that.\n\nTo tell people that it is a \u201cpresumed no\u201d on the internet is just perpetuating this issue and this miscommunication for no reason and may result in people genuinely causing unnecessary stress to their peers.
