I have a huge family and all of them live close together except me and my husband who moved across the country. But I'm still close with them - call them, show up for important events when I can travel. The fact that you saw ZERO value in attending your own brother's wedding is astounding to me. But then to not even give him the courtesy of a phone call to explain why you chose not to attend? Even more astounding. One day you may regret isolating yourself so much.

Not responding at all is a faux pas for people you\u2019re just friends with, it is incredibly rude to ignore an invitation from a relative.", "wild opinion here but if you sent an email about 6 months ago to tell your brother about a wedding and you haven\u2019t heard from him in that six months nor have you confirmed his attendance why would you assume that he would be coming. especially since you havent seen him in three years. we all know the saying about assuming things.

I'm an introvert, you're just rude and inconsiderate.", "YTA - Not for not going, that\u2019s absolutely your choice \n\nRSVP - Literally means respond please (in French), that means whether you are attending or not attending so that arrangements can be made for others to attend in your place / food and drink can be arranged etc. etc. \n\nIt was unbelievably rude of you not to respond and no matter how much you avoid them, they would have absolutely assumed you\u2019d attend your brothers wedding. There\u2019s no fall outs by the sounds of things so you would have no reason not to and whilst they could have checked I can see why they assumed you\u2019d be attending, plus nobody has time to chase up RSVPs, that\u2019s literally what they are for", "Yta for that and for not caring until your boss cared", "YTA. You needed to at least email back that you couldn't attend. Not RSVPing to your brothers wedding isn't sufficient to say you're not coming. People.show uo to stuff they didn't RSVP.to all the time\n \nIt's a wedding, you absolutely needed to make it clear you weren't coming", "YTA. Who cares about extroverts vs introverts?  Talking or not, your family only wanted to see you. Short time or short talk don\u2019t matter.  That\u2019s how family is.  \n\n\nI\u2019m introvert guy.  I have to go to my family gathering and say hi to my family then stay for AN HOUR then I leave. My family? They don\u2019t mind that. They just understand and they are happy to see me.  See where it goes?", "YTA. Being an introvert is one thing, being anti-social and rude is quite another. You were invited to your brother\u2019s wedding.

He chose not to go, so why is he being berated?! He has autonomy to stay away from people if he chooses to do so.", "Exactly.  We're talking about having some basic human decency, regardless of being \"introverted\".", "It honestly sounds like it was either sheer laziness, or this grown adult legitimately doesn\u2019t know what \u201cRSVP\u201d means. \n\n>  didn't RSVP because I would be at a field project at the other side of the country \n\n\u2026.. wut? \n\nThat\u2019s *the actual purpose of an RSVP.* To tell them whether or not you can attend. In his case, to let them know he would not be attending.\n\nIt *sounds* based on this (if we are to take OP\u2019s word for it) as if the OP is under the impression that an RSVP is only to tell them that you *are* attending. \n\nThat aside\u2026. \n\n> I don't have a strong relationship with my family since I went to university at another city .\n\nIt is so extremely common for people to go ti university in a different city\u2026 while it may explain why OP lost frequent contact with family, it is not a reason for them to expect OP not to come to the wedding. People come from all over the place to weddings of people they don\u2019t often see. \n\n> Last t\u0131me I saw my family was pre COVID and I maybe talk with my parents once a month to see if someone is dead.\n\nLots of people have relationships like this with their family. The difference is, these people usually also attend weddings and funerals and the like. It is completely reasonable for the family to still have anticipated OP would come unless informed otherwise.\n\nSo\u2026 even if you didn\u2019t technically know how to RSVP properly\u2026.\n\nIn your own *immediate family,* whom you do not seem to be officially estranged from, to feel as if it is not necessary or expected for you to let them know you won\u2019t be there\u2026.

Yikes. To the point where I am wondering whether maybe there\u2019s an underlying clinical connection to your extreme introversion? Not because you screwed up one time, but because this is a pretty fundamental social cue / expectation that seems to have genuinely not occurred to you at 32 years of age. Your reasoning seems to be very technical (you followed what you thought were the rules, you call them x amount, they live x distance from one another etc etc), but it doesn\u2019t quite seem like enough realistically expect them not to be blindsided by this, or for you to be confused by their reaction. \n\nNot that it matters either way. I hope this thread has helped you understand it. Now that you have your answer here, respond to your family (or don\u2019t) in whatever manner you feel is appropriate.", "Probably not getting many invites soon, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he cares anyway. \nYTA OP.", "This! I completely agree with all the comments stating the obvious, that it was an AH move not to RSVP at all to the wedding invite. That's just common courtesy, especially for immediate family no matter how close you are. But I think the \"cherry-on-top\" is the way OP reacted on the phone to his brother afterwards. His brother was clearly hurt (granted yelling is not a fantastic expression of that, but heck, I probably would have yelled too), and instead of apologising or offering an explanation for his absence, OP just played dumb and hung up because he was \\~too busy\\~ to have an uncomfortable conversation. \n\nOP, YTA.", "Can you explain your reasoning?", "Yeah, people are blowing this way out of proportion.

It has to be answered though", "An invitation is not a summons, but it does require an answer. It\u2019s not that OP didn\u2019t attend, it\u2019s that OP didn\u2019t do a bare minimum response", "Not really.", "Anti-social behaviour is deliberately negative and destructive behaviour against other people. OP has poor social skills but he is not antisocial. He is not close to his family. His absence won't have wounded them deeply because if it had they would have actually arranged to see him in the last few YEARS. They are just irritated and enjoying fussing, they will get over it.\n\nOP your manners are not great but people here are blowing this totally out of proportion.", "It's actually called schizoid personality disorder. These people purposefully avoid social settings and interacting with people. Far beyond any introvert.\n\nIt can be worked on through therapy, but most don't care or want to do that, and are perfectly content with living like this. \n\nNot responding to the RSVP though is just an AH move. I just got married and only one person didn't RSVP at all, and it seriously bothered us. Everyone else that couldn't make it RSVP'ed no, so we at least knew they weren't coming.", "Happy cake day", "Happy cake day!", "Everything in a nutshell.\nOP is YTA for not simply responding to the RVSP.", "A lot of people go low or no contact with family, but there is typically a reason why.

I also grew up under the impression that you respond if you\u2019re a yes. But for close family like a sibling, or for a major event like a wedding (versus, say, a party for a young child of a semi-friend), you gotta let them know either way.
