The person in question has been working here for a good 10 years and is quite old themself. This person has at times rubbed me the wrong way, but due to my previous experiences in different workplaces, I am used to meeting all kinds of people good and bad. \n\nTwo weeks ago, we had a kid fresh out of highschool join us. In preparation for this job, he went and obtained his forklift licence (we call it a forklift ticket), allowing him to legally operate it. It's basically a day of safety theory with a 20 minutes practice and 15 minute test to obtain one. \n\nIn this job, you basically pick and pack the stock that the customer orders and a lot of the time you don't need to use the shared forklift (we're limited to 3 between 7 people) but if you required one, you need to get that out of the way before you can move on. \n\nThis kid being having absolutely no experience on the fork will get bottle necked when that order comes through and he's shitting bricks when on one. He'd asked for one of us to guide him through the pick and since I've gone out of my way to ease him into it, he'd basically wait for me to help him out. \n\nThis old coworker however, though they definitely don't mean any ill intentions, she doesn't know how to communicate properly. Basically gets into the kid's comfort zone when ever he's on the fork essentially making him freeze up every time! Not only that, and eventually kicks him off and picks the stock for him before taking the fork and doing her own pick. \n\nThe kid talks to me since I'm fairly new myself (few months in) saying how he's not getting the experience he needs for the job (mainly around the forklift) because he's always being rushed when he's on it. He just disappears and when our manager managed to reach him, it came out that he's just feels stressed at this company and that was that done. \n\nI took it upon myself and seeked out my manager in private and informed him of what has been told to me and my own experience as a newcomer about this coworker, how in her intentions to get the work done, doesn't understand that new employees doesn't have the experience that she has and thus are slow and needs the time to get trained up. \n\nWell, according to the leading hand she got a verbal warning about about bullying and basically told to stay away from the next new employee since they're desperately recruiting right now and can't afford to lose anyone else.\n\nMy other half is saying that I've already have problems with her so this is a low blow. Especially since the kid didn't make it known as to why he left. My pov is that he has been talking to me, telling me about his anxiety and have also witnessed him being kicked off the fork.", "created_utc": 1694867018, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k6944/aitah_for_outing_a_coworker_to_the_manager_after/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, it is a rare find.\n\nYet you also have to think of it from your co-worker's perspective.
