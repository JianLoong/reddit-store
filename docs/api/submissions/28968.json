Recently Sarah has gained some weight, and so brought some new clothes. I met her this week and she was complaining about how she had tried on a dress and it hadn't fit, however she wasn't able to return it as she had waited a day too long.\n\nI agreed that was annoying, but the dress looked cute and I didn't think it should go to waste, so I offered to buy it from her. She agreed, it was a little big in places but I really liked how it looked and it's probably one of my favorite dresses.\n\nOn Friday Sarah was hosting a birthday party for her boyfriend Sam \\[25M\\], most of the other girls were wearing dresses, I decided to wear the dress I brought from Sarah as no one else has seen it yet and it was cheaper than buying a new dress.\n\nBefore I left I took a photo with some of the other girls who were coming, Sarah messaged me asking if I could please not wear that, turns out she hadn't brought it from the shop, it was actually a gift from Sam and she didn't want to tell him that it didn't fit. This dress was much more expensive then she had told me and come from a specific designer. At this point we were all about to get in my friends car, and I wasn't about to tell them to wait for me, so I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.\n\nWhen we got there, Sarah took me aside and told me she would give me a lift home to change, I said no and she told me to leave. At this point I was annoyed, I said it was Sam's birthday and if he had an issue he could say. Later that evening he complimented the dress and said it was just like one he had brought Sarah not that long ago for their anniversary, at that point she said she wasn't feeling well and went upstairs.\n\nShe messaged me this morning calling me a b\\*tch and an assh\\*le, I feel like I should've been more considerate, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697371894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178e23v/aita_for_wearing_clothes_that_wouldnt_fit_my/", "score": 1169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nice misleading title. The problem isn't that you wore clothes that wouldn't fit your friend, the problem is \\*you wore clothes she specifically asked you not to wear to spare her from embarrassment\\*. At the very least you're not this girl's friend because a friend would have taken the time to change, not ignored the message.\n\nEdit: it's wild how many people in the comments here would show up at someone's party wearing something the host asked you not to wear... and then expect to be considered not-an-asshole. If you're ok doing that then you clearly hate the host and don't care about ruining their party.", "YTA\n\n> so I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.", "YTA.\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nYour friend gave you an extremely discounted price on the dress presumably as a kindness to you, and this is how you repay her?? Now it wasn't the best of Sarah not to be upfront with Sam about the dress but it clearly wasn't for malicious reasons and more so out of insecurity. It would have taken you 2 minutes to change into something else and saved Sarah a lot of hurt.\n\nOn top of that you dare refuse to leave her home and the party that SHE was hosting?\n\nYou're vile.", "Yta. Are you actually friends with her?  Generally friends try to care for one another. Yes she didn\u2019t give you the true reason regarding the dress but a little empathy as to why might go a long way. She made a mistake you could have helped her with. Friends tend to do that for each other.", "YTA, and pretty thick too. Where's your empathy? How hard is it to understand that the fact that she couldn't fit into an expensive dress her bf bought and had to sell it, unbeknownst to bf, was EMBARRASSING to her. The first time she asked, you should have said, \"omg of course!\" \nSomething tells me you love showing people up, think you're hot, probably have a thing for her bf, and make everything about you.", "Your friend isn't mad you can \"wear clothes she can't\" (way to shine yourself up while insulting her, though), she's mad that you exposed her dress trade-away to the person who bought it for her.\n\nYou got a great dress for cheap, but you prioritized looking good at someone else's party over being a legit friend to the very person hosting the party. Do you seriously think *Sam* wanted you there? You were her guest, not his, and you knowingly screwed her over. \n\nYou are a terrible friend. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Lol stop playing dumb. You know what you did.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re tryna tell me you didn\u2019t have a single OTHER dress you could have worn? \u201cCheaper than buying a new one\u201d - do you buy a dress for every new occasion? You must be loaded.\n\nAlso - your friend asked you not to embarrass her, and you ignored her when you had the chance to run back inside and change. That\u2019s bitchass energy right there", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, you did see the message.\n\nSecondly, Sarah was the host. If she tells you to go, then you go. And if it was at their home, then you\u2019re a massive AH. \n\nYou had plenty of opportunities to do the right thing here and you failed at every turn. \n\nYes, she should have been honest from the getgo. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you knowingly did this.", "YTA - not for wearing it initially, but for not changing after she became clean. She was stupid to not tell the whole story but she did and you could have changed twice! You probably ruined her evening", "YTA\n\n>I said no and **she told me to leave.** At this point I was annoyed, I said it was Sam's birthday and if he had an issue he could say.\n\n\nOn top of everything else, this alone would make you the A.

Better be careful, people like you don't keep friends for very long, it's obvious that you were trying to hurt her.

She asked nicely. \n\nYou decided to be dismissive, sneaky (pretending not to see) and rude. Why? Why couldn\u2019t you be a friend?\n\nShe asked you to leave HER HOME, the event she was hosting, and you refused? Even if she had been in the wrong (she wasn\u2019t) you leave when asked.

You've ruined your friendship", "ESH\n\nSarah should have been upfront with you about where the dress came from & should have communicated better with you.\n\nHelp a sister out \u2026 go change! Better to make friends wait & be a little late than potentially ruin someone\u2019s birthday party & create an issue in your friend\u2019s relationship. Seems like you maybe had a different motive for wearing the dress or you\u2019re not really Sarah\u2019s friend. Friends don\u2019t purposely throw each other under the bus.\n\nThe party was about Sam & he apparently did not know Sarah sold the dress. He has no blame in this.

Girl, you're nasty.", "YTA. Way to show that you don't actually care about your alleged friend.", "YTA", "YTA- so you wanted Sam to see you in the dress basically. You wanted to show Sarah how the dress (that was too small for her) was a little big on you but still looked great. You are a terrible friend and I hope Sarah and the others see you for what you are. She confided in you and you rubbed her nose in it.", "YTA. She shouldn\u2019t have lied about the dress, but you sound like a terrible friend and should have changed. Why would you want to cause unnecessary hurt in their relationship?", "E S H... but honestly I think you are kind of an AH. \n\nShe was kind of dumb not to tell you the truth about where the dress came from, probably embarrassed. But would it kill you to change it? I mean it's just few minutes. If she's your friend this is nothing honestly. Also for the b-day boy, if he found out his GF sold the dress he would probably be hurt, doesn't matter it didn't fit her. Why would you want to risk inflicting it on him if you are friends? \n\nI don't know, I just can't imagine a scenario where a simple dress change was required as opposed to spare my friend huge embarrassment/stress and my other friend possibly hurt feelings, it just doesn't seem worth it.\n\nThat being said I seriously doubt you consider either a true friend.", "Yta", "Someone please tell her it\u2019s \u201cbought\u201d \nYTA just for that alone.", "YTA. What a selfish move to do to someone. Sarah deserves a better person in her life than someone like you.", "YTA. It was rude and inconsiderate to wear a dress that you knew would remind her she gained weight. The rest of the details just confirm you are an AH.", "YTA she sold this dress to you for a lower price so in return you embarrass her by wearing the dress she asked you to not wear? Your title is very misleading and I think it\u2019s because you know you\u2019re in the wrong. You aren\u2019t a good friend!", "YTA, she told you to leave, and you stayed?

She shouldn\u2019t have lied to you. Also, did she not consider the fact it wasn\u2019t a one of a kind item. Maybe Sam might think you both owned the same dress?\n\n2. You saw the message.

Seems like you were hoping to cause some drama between her and her BF.", "YTA....wow not cool girl.", "YTA you clearly didn\u2019t care about your friends feelings and just wanted to look hot for *her* boyfriend. You\u2019re a terrible friend, I hope she never talks to you again", "YTA. Nice word play on the title though. You got a designer dress for super cheap from a friend that was embarrassed to let her bf know it didn't fit. \nShe asked you to not wear it to a specific function and told you the reason yet you still went ahead and did it. \nIf you can't see the issue here you are not a good friend at all!", "YTA - and a pretty gross person tbh, this post is full of sly digs at your friend and her weight. \n\nYou could have helped her out and took two minutes to change, we all know it and so do you. You chose not to because you you care more about your looks and shoving the fact you can get into the dress, in the face of your friend.", "Why are you even here asking??

What a bad selfish friend you are.", "YTA. I love how everyone agrees that regardless if Sarah was wrong too, you are an top 1 ah", "YTA. As a friend wouldn't you want her to be comfortable? It's not an argument of what you can wear or if you are in the right, but if you're morally wrong. Which you are.", "YTA. If she was your friend, you would have changed and not ignored her text.

You were incredibly selfish", "YTA", "YTA and YTC.", "\"I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.\"\n\nYTA and yes, you should have been more considerate. Having your friend's back (now ex-friend) was far more important than wearing a designer dress to a party. \n\nI do give you points for coming to this realisation and asking the question, though. You're still quite young, and your generation have been inundated with the message that appearance is everything. This will be a great opportunity for growth for you, if you let it.", "Yta", "YTA", "ESH\nBut y t a. to your friend in this instance. \nCould have chosen another dress, could have gone and changed. \nBut good for Sarah, atleast she knows now that you are not her friend.

She sold you a dress with no caveats, when she should have told you when you could or couldn\u2019t wear it. She also lied to her bf about the dress, which is a bit absurd - did she think he would never ask about why she never wore the expensive gift he bought her, or wonder where it was? If I were him, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if my girlfriend sold my expensive gift to a friend cheaply instead of just telling me it was the wrong size so I could exchange. And I\u2019m a girl btw. This was going to come out eventually, you just made it happen a bit sooner. \n\nWhat was the endgame? Were you supposed to never wear the dress at any party or social event that Sam might come to? That\u2019s pretty unreasonable.\n\nLastly, she didn\u2019t just lie to her bf, she lied straight to your face, made up a whole story about buying a dress that isn\u2019t true.
