Recently Sarah has gained some weight, and so brought some new clothes. I met her this week and she was complaining about how she had tried on a dress and it hadn't fit, however she wasn't able to return it as she had waited a day too long.\n\nI agreed that was annoying, but the dress looked cute and I didn't think it should go to waste, so I offered to buy it from her. She agreed, it was a little big in places but I really liked how it looked and it's probably one of my favorite dresses.\n\nOn Friday Sarah was hosting a birthday party for her boyfriend Sam \\[25M\\], most of the other girls were wearing dresses, I decided to wear the dress I brought from Sarah as no one else has seen it yet and it was cheaper than buying a new dress.\n\nBefore I left I took a photo with some of the other girls who were coming, Sarah messaged me asking if I could please not wear that, turns out she hadn't brought it from the shop, it was actually a gift from Sam and she didn't want to tell him that it didn't fit. This dress was much more expensive then she had told me and come from a specific designer. At this point we were all about to get in my friends car, and I wasn't about to tell them to wait for me, so I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.\n\nWhen we got there, Sarah took me aside and told me she would give me a lift home to change, I said no and she told me to leave. At this point I was annoyed, I said it was Sam's birthday and if he had an issue he could say. Later that evening he complimented the dress and said it was just like one he had brought Sarah not that long ago for their anniversary, at that point she said she wasn't feeling well and went upstairs.\n\nShe messaged me this morning calling me a b\\*tch and an assh\\*le, I feel like I should've been more considerate, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697371894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178e23v/aita_for_wearing_clothes_that_wouldnt_fit_my/", "score": 4140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nice misleading title. The problem isn't that you wore clothes that wouldn't fit your friend, the problem is \\*you wore clothes she specifically asked you not to wear to spare her from embarrassment\\*. At the very least you're not this girl's friend because a friend would have taken the time to change, not ignored the message.\n\nEdit: it's wild how many people in the comments here would show up at someone's party wearing something the host asked you not to wear... and then expect to be considered not-an-asshole. If you're ok doing that then you clearly hate the host and don't care about ruining their party.", "YTA\n\n> so I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.", "YTA.\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nYour friend gave you an extremely discounted price on the dress presumably as a kindness to you, and this is how you repay her?? Now it wasn't the best of Sarah not to be upfront with Sam about the dress but it clearly wasn't for malicious reasons and more so out of insecurity. It would have taken you 2 minutes to change into something else and saved Sarah a lot of hurt.\n\nOn top of that you dare refuse to leave her home and the party that SHE was hosting?\n\nYou're vile.", "Yta. Are you actually friends with her?  Generally friends try to care for one another. Yes she didn\u2019t give you the true reason regarding the dress but a little empathy as to why might go a long way. She made a mistake you could have helped her with. Friends tend to do that for each other.", "YTA, and pretty thick too. Where's your empathy? How hard is it to understand that the fact that she couldn't fit into an expensive dress her bf bought and had to sell it, unbeknownst to bf, was EMBARRASSING to her. The first time she asked, you should have said, \"omg of course!\" \nSomething tells me you love showing people up, think you're hot, probably have a thing for her bf, and make everything about you.", "Your friend isn't mad you can \"wear clothes she can't\" (way to shine yourself up while insulting her, though), she's mad that you exposed her dress trade-away to the person who bought it for her.\n\nYou got a great dress for cheap, but you prioritized looking good at someone else's party over being a legit friend to the very person hosting the party. Do you seriously think *Sam* wanted you there? You were her guest, not his, and you knowingly screwed her over. \n\nYou are a terrible friend. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Lol stop playing dumb. You know what you did.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re tryna tell me you didn\u2019t have a single OTHER dress you could have worn? \u201cCheaper than buying a new one\u201d - do you buy a dress for every new occasion? You must be loaded.\n\nAlso - your friend asked you not to embarrass her, and you ignored her when you had the chance to run back inside and change. That\u2019s bitchass energy right there", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, you did see the message.\n\nSecondly, Sarah was the host. If she tells you to go, then you go. And if it was at their home, then you\u2019re a massive AH. \n\nYou had plenty of opportunities to do the right thing here and you failed at every turn. \n\nYes, she should have been honest from the getgo. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you knowingly did this.", "YTA - not for wearing it initially, but for not changing after she became clean. She was stupid to not tell the whole story but she did and you could have changed twice! You probably ruined her evening", "YTA\n\n>I said no and **she told me to leave.** At this point I was annoyed, I said it was Sam's birthday and if he had an issue he could say.\n\n\nOn top of everything else, this alone would make you the A.

Better be careful, people like you don't keep friends for very long, it's obvious that you were trying to hurt her.

She asked nicely. \n\nYou decided to be dismissive, sneaky (pretending not to see) and rude. Why? Why couldn\u2019t you be a friend?\n\nShe asked you to leave HER HOME, the event she was hosting, and you refused? Even if she had been in the wrong (she wasn\u2019t) you leave when asked.

You've ruined your friendship", "ESH\n\nSarah should have been upfront with you about where the dress came from & should have communicated better with you.\n\nHelp a sister out \u2026 go change! Better to make friends wait & be a little late than potentially ruin someone\u2019s birthday party & create an issue in your friend\u2019s relationship. Seems like you maybe had a different motive for wearing the dress or you\u2019re not really Sarah\u2019s friend. Friends don\u2019t purposely throw each other under the bus.\n\nThe party was about Sam & he apparently did not know Sarah sold the dress. He has no blame in this.

Girl, you're nasty.", "YTA. Way to show that you don't actually care about your alleged friend.", "YTA", "YTA- so you wanted Sam to see you in the dress basically. You wanted to show Sarah how the dress (that was too small for her) was a little big on you but still looked great. You are a terrible friend and I hope Sarah and the others see you for what you are. She confided in you and you rubbed her nose in it.", "YTA. She shouldn\u2019t have lied about the dress, but you sound like a terrible friend and should have changed. Why would you want to cause unnecessary hurt in their relationship?", "E S H... but honestly I think you are kind of an AH. \n\nShe was kind of dumb not to tell you the truth about where the dress came from, probably embarrassed. But would it kill you to change it? I mean it's just few minutes. If she's your friend this is nothing honestly. Also for the b-day boy, if he found out his GF sold the dress he would probably be hurt, doesn't matter it didn't fit her. Why would you want to risk inflicting it on him if you are friends? \n\nI don't know, I just can't imagine a scenario where a simple dress change was required as opposed to spare my friend huge embarrassment/stress and my other friend possibly hurt feelings, it just doesn't seem worth it.\n\nThat being said I seriously doubt you consider either a true friend.", "Yta", "Someone please tell her it\u2019s \u201cbought\u201d \nYTA just for that alone.", "YTA. What a selfish move to do to someone. Sarah deserves a better person in her life than someone like you.", "YTA. It was rude and inconsiderate to wear a dress that you knew would remind her she gained weight. The rest of the details just confirm you are an AH.", "YTA she sold this dress to you for a lower price so in return you embarrass her by wearing the dress she asked you to not wear? Your title is very misleading and I think it\u2019s because you know you\u2019re in the wrong. You aren\u2019t a good friend!", "YTA, she told you to leave, and you stayed?

She shouldn\u2019t have lied to you. Also, did she not consider the fact it wasn\u2019t a one of a kind item. Maybe Sam might think you both owned the same dress?\n\n2. You saw the message. It wouldn\u2019t have been that hard to change once you knew the facts. Seems like you were hoping to cause some drama between her and her BF.", "YTA....wow not cool girl.", "YTA you clearly didn\u2019t care about your friends feelings and just wanted to look hot for *her* boyfriend. You\u2019re a terrible friend, I hope she never talks to you again", "YTA. Nice word play on the title though. You got a designer dress for super cheap from a friend that was embarrassed to let her bf know it didn't fit. \nShe asked you to not wear it to a specific function and told you the reason yet you still went ahead and did it. \nIf you can't see the issue here you are not a good friend at all!", "YTA - and a pretty gross person tbh, this post is full of sly digs at your friend and her weight. \n\nYou could have helped her out and took two minutes to change, we all know it and so do you. You chose not to because you you care more about your looks and shoving the fact you can get into the dress, in the face of your friend.", "Why are you even here asking??

What a bad selfish friend you are.", "YTA. I love how everyone agrees that regardless if Sarah was wrong too, you are an top 1 ah", "YTA. As a friend wouldn't you want her to be comfortable? It's not an argument of what you can wear or if you are in the right, but if you're morally wrong. Which you are.", "YTA. If she was your friend, you would have changed and not ignored her text.

You were incredibly selfish", "YTA", "YTA and YTC.", "\"I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.\"\n\nYTA and yes, you should have been more considerate. Having your friend's back (now ex-friend) was far more important than wearing a designer dress to a party. \n\nI do give you points for coming to this realisation and asking the question, though. You're still quite young, and your generation have been inundated with the message that appearance is everything. This will be a great opportunity for growth for you, if you let it.", "Yta", "YTA", "ESH\nBut y t a. to your friend in this instance. \nCould have chosen another dress, could have gone and changed. \nBut good for Sarah, atleast she knows now that you are not her friend.

She sold you a dress with no caveats, when she should have told you when you could or couldn\u2019t wear it. She also lied to her bf about the dress, which is a bit absurd - did she think he would never ask about why she never wore the expensive gift he bought her, or wonder where it was? If I were him, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if my girlfriend sold my expensive gift to a friend cheaply instead of just telling me it was the wrong size so I could exchange. And I\u2019m a girl btw. This was going to come out eventually, you just made it happen a bit sooner. \n\nWhat was the endgame? Were you supposed to never wear the dress at any party or social event that Sam might come to? That\u2019s pretty unreasonable.\n\nLastly, she didn\u2019t just lie to her bf, she lied straight to your face, made up a whole story about buying a dress that isn\u2019t true.

You DID change my vote in the end. OP was NTA.", "They volunteer to do that for their friends and that makes them a good friend. But it's not ok to demand it from others.", "Yes, and it would be one thing if the friend was like \u201ccan you please buy this off of me\u201d, but it was OP who \u201cloved the dress\u201d and asked to buy it off her even though she didn\u2019t offer. I\u2019m willing to bet that OP is leaving out some finer details intentionally.", "YTA. Imagine ruining a friendship over something this stupid. You easily could have changed and gotten an Uber", "Yta. You\u2019re the ultimate \u201cpick me\u201d mean girl. Grow up.", "I'd lean towards NTA. OP didn't do anything wrong besides not covering Sarah's lie to her boyfriend.

You\u2019re a bad friend", "YTA\u2026. Obviously", "Oh yea YTA. You knew exactly what was at stake and you did the dirty on your \u2018friend\u2019.  It was mean and calculated.

Because then, your conniving behaviour would start to make sense.", "YTA and it\u2019s bought not brought.

You got a nice expensive dress cheaply and when your friend asked you not to throw her under the bus you ignored it and did it spectacularly. \nSaying if Sam had a problem he\u2019d say something to her?

What an awful friend you are", "YTA. I thought first I would judge it not AH, but you got a valid explanation from her why not to wear it.

Sorry, but you should have considered your friend\u2019s predicament.", "YTA. You completely humiliated her, and she specifically asked you not to do something.

You took away her ability to explain what happened at a better time, and you probably caused them to have a fight for all we know.

Ideally she should have let him return or exchange it, or given him a heads up that she was passing it on. It sucks to spend a ton of money on someone only to have them effectively pass on that money to someone else without giving you the chance to recoup that money.\n\nYou suck for being oblivious to how embarrassing it must have been for Sarah for you to show up to his party wearing *the dress HE got HIS girlfriend*.

I have so many questions but I think Sams girlfriend should not have sold it if it was going to be a problem.", "It's not even about sparing embarrassment because it didn't fit her, but not wanting her boyfriend to see her friend wearing something he paid for.  We don't know when Sarah was planning to explain what happened, but for OP to just show up and knowingly walk into avoidable conflict is just shitty.

Like at that point you can see from the fucking moon how much it means to your friend. the dress is a source of shame for her and it feels like OP just wanted to rub it in her face that she had gained weight, especially with the \"it was big in places\" comment- we get it, you're thinner than her.", "Nailed it!\n\nBased on the title, I had started out assuming it would be N-T-A.

Ugh! What an absolute uncaring and unkind thing to do to someone who is supposedly your friend.", "Exactly.

OP was dressed and about to get into the car. If OP's friend had told her when the dress was exchanged, sure, but with so little notice, no, bad luck. OP is NTA.

Sarah should have come clean to her boyfriend because I bet he\u2019ll be hurt to find out that she not only got rid of the gift, but SOLD it?? I could see it if he were her ex, but he needs to know it doesn\u2019t fit. He\u2019s going to keep buying her clothes in that size if she doesn\u2019t update him on her size. I\u2019m sure he would want to correct the size, or support her in trying to lose weight again if that\u2019s her goal.\n\nSarah also should have told OP that it was from Sam and not to wear it around him. If I were OP and found that out, I would have not accepted the dress at that point and tried to convince her to hang onto it for now.\n\nOP should have known not to wear the dress to Sarah\u2019s party as it seems obvious that Sarah might feel bad seeing the dress that she no longer fits. And OP had no good reason to not go change when Sarah asked her.

They\u2019re all liars. \n\nFriend: about the dress\nOP: not seeing the text", "Bingo. She's not even subtle about it.", "Op isnt also a liar for claiming she didnt get the message?", "So Op can lie about recieving the text? That lie is okay?", "And that extra little dimension added about OP wanting to wear the dress \"because no one else had seen it yet\" has that real cartoon narcissistic-rich-girl vibe of not wanting to be seen in the same outfit twice.  \n\nLike, lady... no one cares if they've seen you in a dress you've already worn before unless they're judgemental, superficial jerks", "Right?  Nothing more cringe than someone insisting on being an unwelcome guest.", "I said the same thing.

She made it REALLY easy for her friend to have the dress, then gets upset when she actually wears it? She also wasn\u2019t upfront about where she got the dress or the meaning behind it. That is not OP\u2019s fault. I\u2019m sorry, but this is just one of those things the friend could have been disappointed about, but chosen to move on without making a whole victim vs perp narrative. Besides, she doesn\u2019t have to tell her boyfriend it\u2019s the same dress. It wasn\u2019t one of a kind. I do understand the friend being upset the dress didn\u2019t work out but imo she is wrong for attacking her friend\u2019s character. She honestly set herself up for disappointment by selling the dress to her friend. That was a choice.", "I mean, her friend lied to her about the provenance of the dress until she wa literally getting in the car to go to the party?  If she had known ahead of time she\u2019d never have planned to wear that dress (probably) but she didn\u2019t tell her until minutes before the party?  How is that fair?  Sarah could have a)told her from the start b) returned or exchanged the dress in time c) not sold the dress to someone in her circle, taken it to a resale, d) told Sam it didn\u2019t fit, up front and asked for help getting something that fit or e) played it off at the party instead of making it a big deal. Op could only miss her ride to change or get driven home to change like a kid wearing a slipknot tshirt at school.", "Yeah and sick of people saying friend demanded, and you don't demand friends.. OP made it clear friend was begging, not demanding", "Right, her next post will be AITA for not selling my friend's dress back to her after she's lost weight and her BF wants to see her wear the dress he bought her.", "Yeah it's like the whole child free wedding thing. If you put requirements on what is done in your home, people might not come...\n\nI think disregarding her friends feelings about a gift she was given then sold to you because she felt bad... yeah it's the worst kind of selfish. She didn't wear it because she wanted to prevent friends from waiting, she didn't care in the first place- if she did care about the people waiting then she's double AH because then NOT waiting for her to change is more important than her friends deeply personal embarrassment?

It\u2019s entirely possible that she didn\u2019t want her boyfriend to know that she sold the very nice present he got her in case it would hurt his feelings. People like OP like to convince themselves that the only reason they\u2019re ever involved in conflict is because everyone else is jealous of them. OP, the reason this turned into an issue is solely because YTA.", "I'm so confused. Who the hell does OP think she is to TELL OP THAT SHE IS NOT LEAVING and if her BF had a problem, he should say something.... WTF?\n\nMy gawd, the absolute audacity!", "Was literally going to comment the exact same thing.\n\nSarah obviously has an issue with being honest with people. She should have told her boyfriend, Sam, the dress didn\u2019t fit right from the beginning. I get that it\u2019s an embarrassing topic, but if you\u2019re not comfortable enough to be honest with your boyfriend about an anniversary gift, then you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with them. Then, she goes on and sells the dress to her friend without telling her the background behind it. She didn\u2019t lie about it, but withholding information is a form of dishonesty.\n\nIf Sarah was really so concerned about Sam possibly seeing someone else in the dress, she shouldn\u2019t have given it away. Also, did Sarah ever even give him the money she received for the dress? I am assuming not, considering she didn\u2019t tell him that she got rid of it. So this man spent good money on a gift for her that she then sold and pocketed the money. More dishonesty.\n\nYet another point, Sarah sold the dress. At that point it is no longer hers and she has no say over when it is worn. That is just rude to tell someone when they can and can\u2019t wear something.\n\nNTA", "Maybe its the way this is written but im so confused and have no idea what your trying to say - but im genuinely curious. \n\n\"and OP girls tried to use the guys' stupidity and willingness to blindly involve themselves with zero context to stay around.\" What does this mean?", "It\u2019s also weird to me that she would want to go wear the dress to this in the first place, even before sending a pic of it to the group. Like, you bought this dress from a friend who was insecure about the way it fit (or didn\u2019t) on her, so you wear it to an event that said friend is hosting? And then to double down after the friend asks you not to wear it, then triple down in the day of event????", "OP also buried the fact that her friend had done her a huge favour by giving her this very expensive dress for apparently very little money. Definite YTA.", "I'll give OP a little grace because Sarah didn't think to let her know ahead of time that she didn't want her to wear it, but, especially when Sarah was willing to <i>drive her home</i> to change, OP might have asked if she could borrow another dress - claim that she tore her's getting out of the car.", "Despite or in spite of", "Yeah but she was already ready and on the way, at least it seems to me, as she posted it. I would be too lazy to go home, find a new dress, change, and go on my way. Depending on how far away from the birthday place op lives... Yeah, her friend is also an AH because things wouldn't be like this if she had been honest from the beginning.", "Yeah at that point, I knew OP had it out for the \"friend\" but still wants to pretend she is a nice person. OP is delusional if she thinks this post was going to fool anyone.", "And then was asked to leave and just ignored it. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nice", "Basically, when you're a part of a decent sized friend group with men and women that is more mixed, sometimes someone will bring a new person into the group. If the new person is a girl like OP, basically rude to the women and trying to get with the guys, the guys will often take her side and call the other women dramatic or petty to keep the girls from kicking her out. But in actuality, she brings toxicity in and either the gals band together to force the issue, or they try to ignore her and the guys usually learn the hard way and cry about, \"why didn't you warn me\" when she breaks into one of their houses and and pees on their dog. Basically, men defend crazy in these groups because they fall for the damsel in distress game. This happens in a lot of these groups, which is why so many women know what I'm talking about.\n\nIf you're a dude and your galfriends warn you about someone and don't have a history of toxicity, listen to them or gain a stalker at your own peril. Eventually, the gals will leave if toxic girl doesn't and the group falls apart.", "Not sell it to someone with secret conditions attached? Ebay exists.", "Right? It's not hard to make an excuse for a dress change without embarrassing the friend. My first thought was \"Oh no, just got my period a bit earlier than usual and there was a small stain, so I had to change\"", "She didn't have to wear a dress. She wanted to wear a dress. It wasn't a wedding or something.", "And I mean, it might not even be that she gained weight-- all we have is OP saying that and I'm not sure I'd trust her version. \n\nWomen's sizing is *wacky* and not consistent at all-- BF could have bought her normal size and the bust didn't fit bc idk, boobs don't exist or something, or wasn't enough room in the hips, or too short/too long... There are a ton of reasons that someone buying clothes for you may not work out 100% and weight gain isn't near the top of the list. Shopping as a woman or for a woman can just really suck sometimes", "And she probably doesn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. What if her bf think his gf like the very nice gift that he got her. YTA.", "Yeah like how big can it be? *eye roll*", "Here's the thing I personally agree with you and think OP's friend should talk to her bf for her own sake, BUT I also think that doesn't make OP any less of an AH. Regardless of whether or not she made the right decision, her friend is struggling and asked her to do a small thing for her. OP put her own convenience over her supposed friend's comfort. That's a sucky friend.", "Not only that, but she acts like it was the *only* thing she could\u2019ve worn to that party without buying a new dress. Like, it was that or nothing?", "It matters. Tell me you would miss your ride to change if someone sold you a dress under false pretenses and then minutes before a party begged you not to wear it because they lied about where it came from.", "What they don't realize is that the fake-complaining is the embarrassing part.", "It wasn\u2019t though. It could have been explained as \u201cSam bought Sarah a gift that didn\u2019t fit and she missed the return window by a day. The dress fit me and I bought it from her.\u201d Body size and weight didn\u2019t need to factor into anything", "Exactly! The whole weight gain could've been left out...easily could've been the other way around...maybe it was too big for Sarah and fit OP for all we would've known \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
