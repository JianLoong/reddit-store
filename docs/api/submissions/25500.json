It was admittedly a very messy breakup, but this was 4+ years ago, so I've moved on plenty. I got a message from \"Erin\" (26f) a friend that I met after the breakup, and she mentioned she had been talking with Kay and was considering pursuing a relationship. This was fine, who my friends choose to date is none of my business, but she mentioned since she knew I dated Kay, that she wanted me to tell her what the relationship was like\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I have no interest in intentionally sabotaging any potential dates for Kay in the future or anything like that, I prefer to just move on. But I get why Erin would want to know, so I was honest about what it was like. Lots of her going into depressive fits and slamming doors if I \"wasn't in the mood\" or similar things to the point it felt like walking on eggshells if I wanted to be honest, slamming her fist on stuff when mad at games, not helping with dishes or cleaning up dinner, making bad financial decisions, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell Kay then found out about this conversation and got upset at me saying I shouldn't have told her about all that because I'm \"disclosing her mental illness without permission\" (She has multiple diagnoses, though I didn't name any when talking to Erin) and \"stigmatizing\" her mental illness by portraying her so badly, and that I should have just refused to talk about it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692990399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16184a1/aita_for_being_honest_when_a_friend_asked_about/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When people ask for this kind of info, I'd say they already have some concerns and need justification for those uneasy feelings.

Erin asked, you answered with the truth. If Kay doesn't want to be portrayed badly, she shouldn't act badly.", "NTA. The information you provided gave your friend some insight into a potential partner. If she struggled with mental health issues but has stepped up and is aggressively addressing them,  that is a sign of growth. Same goes for financial, as well as other issues you experienced in the relationship. Since you are not a healthcare entity, and your comments were not made in an effort to harm her in anyway, you have every right to disclose the information about what caused your relationship to fail.

I understand why she could be offended by you airing the proverbial dirty laundry, but you're neither bound by any legal means from discussing what went on in your relationship with a mutual friend nor necessarily expected not to talk with anyone about what happened in a rough break-up. You only provided information when asked, not out of spite, but in response to an honest question as an honest answer.", "NTA. I think more people should be honest about their abusive experiences with exes and what you described is abuse. You didn't disclose any mental illnesses to your friend but rather your experiences, to which those diagnosis may explain but don't excuse.", "NTA, and if Kay had actually addressed any of her mental health issues and developed better coping mechanisms so she could protect her partners from the fallout, then she could have responded with honestly and integrity that yeah, she was probably difficult to be close to at that time, but she had done a lot of work in the 4 years since then. since her reaction was to lash out at you, instead, it seems you sharing this info with your friend was valuable.", "NTA, but Erin is an enormous AH for letting it get out what she requested that she tell you in confidence.", "NTA, you were being honest", "NTA you have every right to answer a question posed to you; though I personally don't think you should have answered, it is still your choice.  your ex, however, has every right to feel that you shouldn't have and has every right to have her feelings about it. whether you bashed her or not, it was indiscreet, and clearly your 'friend' is no better.

I\u2019ve live with mental illness my entire life and medical personnel were very clear with me in my teens and early twenties that I didn\u2019t get to use my mental illness as an excuse for bad behavior. That didn\u2019t mean that I could control everything at all times but it sounds from your limited description like she wasn\u2019t experiencing bits here and there but that she made it your responsibility.m to simply deal with the fallout of her mental illness when not fully or properly treated. Not cool, and definitely the sort of thing I believe in sharing with a friend who\u2019s considering dating her. Your ex needs to grow up and take some responsibility for her own actions. If she\u2019s unable to treat a romantic partner with a basic level of decency due to an uncontrollable aspect of her illness then she doesn\u2019t simply HAVE THE RIGHT to date and treat people badly because she \u201ccan\u2019t help it.\u201d  There\u2019s a different between a support system and paid caregivers, which some people seem to have a great deal of difficulty in grasping.", "I agree.
