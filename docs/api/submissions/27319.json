Three days ago, I found his truck's keyless proximity starter went through an entire wash cycle, and of course, it does not work. Tried to start his vehicle, no luck; took the vehicle (with second fob) to the dealer service, who said it is FUBAR.   A new replacement fob will cost around $450.

I check pockets before I put things in the hamper and before putting them in the wash, and I\u2019ve done that even when I lived alone.

Having said all this, if it takes an extra 30 seconds to make sure you\u2019re not ruining a key fob, which is a costly item, maybe it just makes sense to do it.\n\nEdit: Forgot\u2026NTA", "OP said not checking pockets has created extra work. A few seconds to check or a few hours to clean up the mess. Not to mention the expense of the losses.\n3 seconds would have paid her 450.00. Instead it cost them 450.00.\nOP has proven, on all aspects, that it's less work and less expensive to take a few seconds to check pockets.\nI find money and it's all mine. I find keys and you have to pay me to get them back. I find jewelry and let my kids fret about telling us they lost it. Then I return it.\nI find rocks, crayons, sharpies, pens, pocket knives etc and I make sure I am well paid for my 3 seconds of checking.\nI have also found things I wasn't intended to ever know about such as speeding tickets, soft porn letters, pink slips for being late to work. \nYou can learn lots about your family by checking pockets. I don't always reveal what I know as I believe we all need to feel secure in our shoes. However, it's good to have more understanding.\nPockets hold lots of things. Ignoring many things is costly and creates more work, check the pockets."]}
