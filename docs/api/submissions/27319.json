Three days ago, I found his truck's keyless proximity starter went through an entire wash cycle, and of course, it does not work. Tried to start his vehicle, no luck; took the vehicle (with second fob) to the dealer service, who said it is FUBAR.   A new replacement fob will cost around $450.

But overall she is also an a hole (husband is an ahole for not checking pockets at all and expecting her to do it), because she admits to having stuff be ruined of hers also. \n\nSince both of them leave stuff in the pockets they should check the pockets for stuff. \n\nBest solution is they both try to check pockets when they put stuff away, and the person that throws the laundry in checks pockets before putting it in the wash. If OP is the one that does most of the laundry husband should start doing some more of it.", "I said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call OP an AH. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating being in a long term relationship when someone constantly does something that they shouldn\u2019t over and over again year in year out, no matter how insignificant it is. If the asking politely doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s understandable one would get fed up with things and stop fixing things. \nThere\u2019s no need to be rude, we are all here respectfully participating in a discussion.", "I do, actually. I check my pockets before throwing anything in the hamper, and my wife checks anything she puts in the washing machine. Because I'm an adult and she's not a mindless drone.", "Our hamper has two halves so anything coloured goes in one half and anything white/grey goes in the other and I put a load on when either half looks full!", "I don\u2019t recall OP saying that was the issue. \n\nSeems to be whether taking two seconds of patting pockets to make sure you don\u2019t ruin expensive is too hard for her or too hard for him. \n\nNeither. They are both annoying.", "It\u2019s reasonable for the person who has a part time job to do more around the house than the person with the full time job. Shit, we both work full time but I\u2019m home all day so I do more than my wife. But I give her pockets a squeeze before I drop stuff into the laundry. And it\u2019s rare that I find something because she does the same before putting stuff in the basket.  \n\nHow people make it 20 years constantly feeling like they\u2019re being taken advantage of because they have to squeeze a pocket is a fucking mystery to me. Grow up or get divorced. Jesus.", "Does *anyone* not check to be sure? People can forget, if you are currently putting stuff in the machine you would check (or turn it inside out or whatever) since that is how laundry works.", "I don't know. It seems the husband is incapable of checking his pockets before dumping the clothes in the hamper. I didn't see how that could be OP's fault.", "Alright, let me rephrase it into a story format so you can better understand the events that took place here. \n\nOnce upon a time, a grown man's pants were dirty. He decided to take them off and put them in the hamper, unaware that his keys were still in the pocket. Meanwhile, his wife, assuming that her husband was responsible enough to check his own pockets, mistakenly put the pants in the washer and proceeded to wash them. Therefore, the mistake was ultimately his because he should have been responsible enough to check his pockets in the first place. Additionally, as a result of the mishap, the husband now faces the consequence of having to pay $450 to replace the ruined keys. This incident serves as a valuable lesson for him to always check his pockets before putting clothes in the hamper or washing machine.", "Please refer to the little story I created to provide a better example of the situation.", "She\u2019s doing something she shouldn\u2019t either. As an adult she should be checking pockets for stuff. That\u2019s the right thing to do regardless of you have a partner or not. That makes her an ah.", "Yeah, we do textures instead of colors, but same setup. We literally dump the hamper into the machine without sorting it.  We don't go through every item until it's clean and being put away.", "I don't think checking pockets of every single article of clothing would only take 2 seconds. It would add a few minutes and you might even still miss it. He's a grown man, he should empty his pockets before taking his clothes off. The fact that this has been an ongoing issue is ridiculous and they need to learn to empty before getting undressed. Was he without his keys for days before that load got done? Does he have to go back and check his hamper for his missing items regularly? My goodness.", "No, that\u2019s not \u201chow laundry works\u201d. The machines runs perfectly fine with or without a pocket check. \n\nAs a functioning adult I put my clothes in hamper without anything in the pockets, then I put everything from the hamper in the machine. \n\nIf it\u2019s not ready for the washing machine, it\u2019s not in the hamper.", "Because people forget things? It takes like a minute to check if there\u2019s stuff in pockets when you\u2019re doing the wash. She\u2019s an asshole because she categorically refuses to check pockets no matter what.", "My wife and I both do it when we do laundry, because both of us have had things go through the wash we\u2019d rather not. So we talked about it. Yes we both try to be cognizant of what\u2019s in our pockets when putting stuff in the hamper, but obviously we\u2019ve missed stuff in the past. So, now when either of us is loading the washer we take 2 seconds to pat the pockets of any pants going in. \n\nIt really doesn\u2019t take that much time.", "Because a few minutes to be proactive is such a huge issue?\n\nESH", "A few minutes > hundreds of dollars ???\n\nBe a dude, not a dick. Help your partner out.", "[removed]", "Why would you check the pockets of every single article of clothing? The vast majority of clothing items don't have any pockets.", "So you either already have checked that you didn't leave something in the pockets or assume you cannot have made a mistake. But you can make a mistake.", "Are you already sorting every single item? If you don't use separate hampers for the loads and have to sort every item out individually, I get that would be fast. But we don't have to sort. We have different hampers for different loads. Adding in going through the hamper to search for items with pockets to check would add a noticable amount of time to our laundry time. We just dump the hampers into the machine.", "Two seconds? So you only check two articles of clothes gotcha", "Agreed, I don\u2019t think the other replies comprehend that \u201c2 seconds\u201d is a tongue in cheek hyperbole about the minimal effort required to simply touch the area around pockets as you move laundry into the machine.", "Question for you, do you sort every article of clothing? Like, are you already touching every article individually even if not checking the pockets?", "We don\u2019t even separate whites and colors, there\u2019s no need with modern detergents on a cold wash. But, we do need to grab each item to put it in the washer. It\u2019s just not practical or really feasible to dump it in, so we are touching each item (or handfuls of smaller items) so it is really no effort whatsoever to check each pair of pants. It\u2019s what? 4-6 items per load that actually need checked?", "If you assumed I meant two seconds literally and not as a turn of phrase which means \u201cnegligible amount of time\u201d then sure. \n\nIf you took me seriously instead of literally, anything up to adding one minute to a task should be considered no time at all. \n\nBut in any event, I\u2019m sick of repeating the same thing in response to every post. \n\nTheir cost-to-whining ratio for both of them is off the charts.", "I always forget the internet takes you literally and not seriously. \ud83d\ude44", "No, but I don\u2019t need to do that to check the ten pockets in each load of laundry?", "I don't have to remove every item, I either dump or grab big armfuls and have no idea what items are in the load to know if it has pockets. \n\nWe all do it differently, so what's a few seconds for one person is a lot more steps for another.", "How do you know there are 10 pockets in each load? You are digging through the hamper and going through every single item in there to look for items with pockets? No way that's only a few seconds. You're pulling everything out and checking it!\n\nEdit: I have to jump off here but I think I made my point that everyone does laundry differently so what's a few seconds for you is a noticable amount of time for someone else."]}
