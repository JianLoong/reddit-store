He's amazing in all aspects and we've talked about marriage and potentially having kids dependent on where we are financially in a few years. I can definitely see myself spending the rest of my life with him. However, there's one thing that really irks me about him: his morning routine. \n\nI'm an early riser, usually getting up around 6am everyday, even on weekends when I don't work. I love having time to myself in the morning to decompress before my day and it makes me really feel like i've earned my evening and it's easier for me to go to bed early for the next day. I find waking up that early works best for me and it's been this way since I was a teenager. \n\nJosh likes to start his morning later, sometimes in the afternoon. He can work flexibly so usually he wakes at 10, 12/1 on weekends. He'll make himself breakfast and makes more mess in the kitchen and then he starts his day. He also goes to bed a lot later than me because of this. Josh comes from a family where they worked long night shifts so waking up later in line with his parents was normal to him and he's carried this habit through to adulthood. \n\nI really wish he would wake up earlier. Maybe not with me (although that would be nice) but a few hours. We spend as much time together as possible outside of work but it would be nice to spend more and to be able to go to bed together. I also think that he would just be more productive if he got up earlier and we could make morning plans on the weekend like going out for brunch or a nice hike. So, I brought this up to him. \n\nHe basically freaked out and asked me why I'm always trying to change his routine (I don't, I've only asked a few times) and that he just functions that way. I really don't understand that, there are studies in which people are aligned to wake up with the sun hence things like sunrise alarms. Josh wakes up when the sun is already up. He said it was excessive for him to wake up at 8am when I've already started my workday so we could only spend mornings together on weekends anyway. We have tried to do that but he just reverts to his old ways and I think if he got up earlier consistently on weekdays, we could spend mornings on weekends together. \n\nAITA for \"trying to change [his] morning routine?\"", "created_utc": 1686135698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143a2u0/aita_for_trying_to_change_my_partners_morning/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The problem here is that you see his natural way of being as unnatural and in need of correction, and yours as the 'right' way. If he was asking you to get up later every weekend day so that you could sleep in together and he didn't have to sleep in alone, would you think that was reasonable? If he asked you to stay up late with him to keep him company, would you be happy to make that change?\n\nIf you want a future with this person, you need to start thinking of it as a continuation of the life you already have, not a future where you have 'fixed' him.", "YTA. What would you say if he asked you to change your routine to match his? How easy would that be for you?\n\n>I love having time to myself in the morning to decompress before my day\n\nThat's great for you but not for him. You wouldn't get time alone if he did this.\n\n>asked me why I'm always trying to change his routine (I don't, I've only asked a few times)\n\nWasn't he clear the first time?\n\n>he just functions that way.

So, I brought this up to him. \n\nYou sound remarkably pushy.", "YTA\n\nI say this as someone who has to get up before 4a.  You can be just as productive from 10a -2a as you can be from 6a-10a. In fact if you're not used to getting up early, you will be tired and less productive.  There is a reason why some people are naturally early birds or night owls.  \n\nIt's very well maybe that you guys are just not compatible and that would be a NAH situation.  What makes you the AH is you're repeatedly trying to change his schedule to suit your wants.\n\nYou've been together 3 years, this didn't just come up. Even if you didn't live together, you had to know about his sleeping habits.  I'm assuming you've tried to plan something on a weekend morning before.", "YTA - Why don't you switch *your* morning routine?", "YTA. And I'm sick of morning people thinking they're somehow morally superior to us night owls. We end up with the same amount of awake time, just at opposite ends, and waking up early would make me LESS productive and chill as I have been a night person since early childhood and I am grumpy af in the mornings.\n\nEither both of you change your routines a little bit to align more towards centre, or you just have to accept that neither of you needs to change and maybe you two just aren't compatible.", "If josh had asked you to start staying up late and sleeping in on weekends how would you have responded to that", "YTA. What makes you tight? My natural sleep rhythms are similar to your bf's, despite having to be up early every day. Just because there are studies done,  it doesn't mean every single human is exactly the same. If you keep trying to change your bf, trust me, you'll lose him. After all, his flexi option is probably one of the things that attracted him to the job. Come off your high horse waking at 6 every morning doesn't make you perfect", "YTA - you\u2019ve asked him a few times, and he\u2019s told you a few times he is fine with his routine.", "YTA. Why is it his responsibility to change his entire routine while you make absolutely no changes yourself?", "YTA. Your way isn't the right way, it is a way. Not everyone is a morning person. He tried, it didn't work, move along. Make peace with it and stop trying to control your partner.", "YTA. \n\n\"I find waking up that early works best for me \" Then you should be able to understand how waking up later works best for him. As a person who wakes up later in the day I can promise you that you will acomplish nothing good by forcing him up early, his body might be up but *the person* you love will wake up later, so you'll have to deal with his grumpy face.", "Why don\u2019t you try his routine ? Lol me personally when i wake up early i do what you do but i also do what he does which is my me time", "YTA. My husband and i have these sleep schedules, or at least we did before kids. I never tried to make him get up early and he never tried to get me to stay up late. We still managed to spend plenty of time together.\n\nNow that we have a baby, we each get one morning on the weekend to do what we want. If he wants to sleep in as late as possible, he gets to. \n\nIf you're expecting someone to make a big change, then you're setting yourself up for trouble in your relationship. People are who they are. If you need a big change to be happy, and this is a big change, this isn't the right relationship for you.", "YTA.  Stop trying to change someone to meet your expectations.  That is a losing path.  People only change when they want to.  And some people really do work better with different sleep patterns.  \n\nInstead you need to decide what is more important to you, having a partner to go to bed with and wake up early with or Josh.", "Yessss YTA. You could ask maybe from time to time if you wanna do something early in the morning so he could prepare but the way you wrote this makes you sound like an AH. He's 25 and has established a productive routine for him the way you have for yourself. It's annoying when people can't seem to understand when you like doing things a certain way. Let the man sleep.", "What is it with morning people that you always think your circadian rhythm is a natural law of the universe but other people's is just them being difficult? I have literally never seen this nonsense the other way round - I'm sure it does happen occasionally, but I'm yet to encounter it. \n\nWould you change your sleep/wake cycle that works for you for him? Or would that be unreasonable? \"There are studies\" shut up, there are also studies that show a distinct cohort of people who have a naturally permanently shifted sleep phase to later in the day but you don't care about those because they're not convenient to your narrative. Have you considered that the fact his whole family are apparently lifelong night shifters might be giving you a potentially significant and relevant piece of information about his natural sleeping habits? Has it occurred to you that just as you fell into a natural sleep pattern for you as a teenager, so did he? \n\nYes YTA. If this is a major source of incompatibility in your relationship, that's one thing - sometimes things we can't change about ourselves sadly make us not compatible to be in relationships with other people. But this isn't you being mature and thoughtful about unchangeable incompatibilities, this is you taking a moral stance on sleeping and trying to browbeat your partner into making themselves tired and miserable to please you.", "YTA some people naturally wake up at different times, there are studies for it to if you look it up. Also productivity has nothing to do with when you wake up. I get more done in the afternoon/early evening then if i force myself up early. Then i just end up tired all day.", "YTA. You are a morning person that is involved with a person who is not. Some people just cannot function early in the morning, it\u2019s a biological thing. My husband and I are the same way. I get up at 4:30 am and start my day, he is closer to 9, sometimes 10. However, he does usually lay down with me when I go to bed and reads until he\u2019s ready for sleep. If you are in a relationship you are going to have to learn to compromise and respect each others individuality. You can be individuals and still be a couple. Relationships aren\u2019t about becoming the same person, it\u2019s about two parts equaling a whole, but there are still two parts.", "YTA. Grow up and stop trying to force your routine on him", "YTA - Everyone is different, there is such a thing as night owls. From your comments i see you tried his routine and couldn't do it. What makes you think it would be easier for him to adapt to your routine? And no \"Waking up earlier is easy\" isn't an answer, because it isn't easy for a lot of people.", "YTA. Your routine doesn't work for your partner. Everyone is different with their morning routine. Let Josh have his own that works the best for him. You are messing up everything for him if you make changes without his consent. IF he doesn't like the changes, leave it alone.", "Josh seems that this works best for him. Why are you allowed to have something that works best for you but he can\u2019t? You\u2019ve asked and he\u2019s said no. Maybe once in a while you all can do stuff but I think it\u2019s kind of ridiculous to expect him to change his way because it\u2019s best for YOU.", "What a nicely written post. But YTA.\n\nStop trying to change people.", "YTA\n\nMakes sense to want to spend more time with your partner doing fun things but you did not give one reason why this would benefit Josh. He appears to be doing fine & functioning well. You want him to do it your way because you believe your way is right. \n\nJosh doesn\u2019t need to be \u201cfixed\u201d & you will either have to accept this or seriously think about what the rest of your life will look like with Josh. Unless Josh gets a 9-5 job, I don\u2019t anticipate he will change his routine in the near future.\n\neta \u2014 based on your comments you appear to believe it would be very challenging to change your routine ... yet feel it should be no problem for Josh. That makes zero logical sense.", "YTA.  Some people are naturally morning people while others are night owls. Until my late 30s, I was a night owl. Waking up early would make me feel so off and unwell during the day. \n\nI don\u2019t see you bending here. If you want to spend more time together, maybe stay awake a few hours later. Or maybe propose to him to wake up around 8am instead of 10, and you wake up at 8, also. That way, you compromise. \n\nAsking him to make changes to please you without you offering changes yourself is definitely AH behavior.", "YTA he is not comfortable standing up at 6 and there is no reason he should have to. Enjoy your peaceful mornings alone and plan afternoon activities on the weekend. \n\nAlso neither of you should leave breakfast mess in the kitchen, whether it is 6:00 or 12:00", "YTA his sleep schedule works for him just as yours works for you. In a comment you say that \u201chis attitude feels off\u201d when he wakes up early and he perks up later. Why do you want him to be grumpy because it suits you better? That seems a recipe for resentment on his part. Trust me: you can\u2019t create a morning person. You can make plans sometimes where the expectation is he\u2019s up sooner\u2014\u201chey I\u2019d like to go on this hike Saturday, do you think we could leave ~9?\u201d\u2014but you can\u2019t just \u201cfix\u201d his sleep schedule. He will still be naturally drawn to staying up late and waking up late; he\u2019ll just be miserable being forced to adapt to your schedule. You\u2019ve clearly asked enough times for him to start getting mad about the repeated requests, so either stop or decide this is a major compatibility issue and break it off.", "YTA.\n\nSorry, but yes you are. My husband is the early bird, he gets up HOURS before me. He enjoys the \"alone\" time where he just does his own thing. Which is the same thing he would have done if I were up, but he can do so without consideration.\n\nYou've got a rythm which works for you and that's great. He's got a rythm which works for him and that is also great.\nIt's a shame you're not on the same rythm, but trying to drag him over on yours is a good way to breed resentment.\n\nYou're also more likely to get \"tired\" of each others company if you don't have the option of a break. Like being on different rythms.\n\nIf you want to do something on a saturday/sunday morning, then this is something you plan the day before.", "YTA.\n\nAll of your reasons are centered around YOU. YOU want to have brunch with him, YOU want to go on nice hikes with him, YOU want him to be more productive, and YOU think it\u2019ll be better if he wakes up earlier.\n\nIs there any indication from your partner that he wants to do the things YOU want? Doesn\u2019t seem to be. Accept that your partner\u2019s body is different from yours\u2014 an earlier start to the day won\u2019t necessarily mean better productivity for him.\n\nIf you were married and had kids this would be a different story, but you\u2019re not.", "I think it's established that Josh shouldn't have to change his routine and nor should you. The question is, now that you've reached this impasse, is it a dealbreaker? You can either compromise (which evidently does not seem possible), accept that you'll always be operating on different schedules or break up really", "YTA\n\nAnd based on your comments I would pick a few more adjectives but it\u2019s not worth a ban. \n\nYes, you have no right to ask him to change his routine. You can either consider it a dealbreaker and end things with him or keep yourself occupied during the morning until he wakes up. \n\nIf he refuses to spend any time with you after he\u2019s awake then you have a different problem. \n\nAlso, stop playing the what if scenarios. It\u2019s not productive. Playing the \u201cwhat if he gets promoted\u201d card is pointless. I\u2019ve known people who passed on promotions for that specific reason and everyone respected their decision.", "Yea YTA \n\nNot everyone functions the same. Nor has the same needs.  Unless I am sick - I just can\u2019t go to bed early - it doesn\u2019t work for me.  That doesn\u2019t make me lazy or anything else. It means my body has different needs.  \n\nMy husband usually falls asleep faster than me but he also sleeps later than me if I let him (I.e. on the weekends)", "YTA. This I just how some people are. It took me a long time to mentally adjust to my partner's routine, especially since when I don't get enough sleep I'm monstrous. But my partner just naps 24hrs a day. By this, I mean he will have 4 or 5 periods of short, deep sleep, followed by a wakeful energetic period. That means that I almost always go to bed alone. Would I like it if we went to bed at the same time? Sure would! Am I going to try to force that change on him? Absolutely not. There's no point. This is how he functions, so we just accommodate each other.\n\nI don't think this applies to your situation, since it sounds like your partner is going to bed late and sleeping forever. But weirdly enough, my sleep schedule and my partner's sleep schedule means that we haven't struggled at all with sleep and having a baby. Our kid is 4 months old now, so when my partner has his evening nap, I can put the kid to bed and go to bed myself. My partner and the baby naturally wake up together for an evening feed, then he'll put the baby back to bed, come to bed himself, and I take the next feeding when I am naturally up for the day. Both of us are consistently getting all the sleep we both need, every day. It's been great!", "YTA. First of all, why does every day have to be 'productive?'  Relax. \n\nSecond, you sound like you're one of those insufferable people who think being an early riser is some kind of virtue that makes you a better person than those who arent. It isnt. \n\nWhy cant you find some compromise? How willing are you to stay up later for him? Has it not occurred to you that being up later feels good to him the way being up early feels to you? Everyone is different; just because you dont understand that his natural sleep cycle is different from yours doesnt change the fact that it is.\n\nIf you make this your hill to die on, you will end your relationship. Let the man sleep. Time apart in a relationship is just as important as time together and having a partner who wants to spend every second together is fucking exhausting, especially if he is an introvert.", "YTA-The way you sleep and wake works for you. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a fact that it works for everyone exactly the same way. Leave his routine alone and let him continue to do what works for him.", "YTA.\n\nWhat works for you doesn't work for other people.\n\nThat being said, you should not be havng kids with a man who has this kind of routine.", "I\u2019m a morning person and I now only date other morning people. Why tf am I waiting for you to get up at 2pm? It\u2019s annoying but u can\u2019t change him so leave if it\u2019s that important", "YTA. Yes, SOME people are wired for daytime, but SOME people are wired for nighttime. Not everybody is a farmer. And getting up later does not mean he isn't productive. If he's active for just as many hours in a 24 hour period as you are, he is not less productive just because his time-window is on the later half of the day.\n \nYou want him to get up earlier, but have you considered getting up later? How about trading once in a while, like one day a week for him to get up earlier and one day where you get up later? If you're going to change something about the routine, it's only fair that you BOTH change a bit. \n\nBut most importantly, neither of you should have children if you are both so rigid about your routine. Kids are chaos incarnate and neither of you will get to stick to your precious routine if you make babies. You WILL need to compromise and make changes to suit your kids, if not eachother. So until you can get this scheduled/routine sorted out to BOTH of your satisfaction, put all other future-things(especially children) on hold.", "YTA. This is exactly why morning people are the absolute worst. \n\nIf it bothers you to not be on the same schedule, then the onus is on you to change, since you\u2019re the one with the problem. Your circadian rhythm and the need to be up as the asscrack of dawn does not trump your partner\u2019s circadian rhythm.", "YTA", "Just have kids, the there won't be a sleep schedule, you'll both be permanently tired and such talk will only evoke nostalgia for what once was.", "YTA", "NAH - I am in a similar situation as you OP. My boyfriend get's up 4 hours later than me in weekdays and a lot more on weekends. Right now I IT IS just annoying, but I really don't know how to deal with this in the future, if we have kids. I mean, how do I explain to them that Daddy is still sleeping, while they have to get up for school or kindergarden, and how do i explain the concept of bedtime, If Daddy stays up until until 3 am every night? I would love to have breakfast together and go to bed together, i wouldn't mind to start my workday 2 hours later, If he started his das 2 hours earlier...", "Mostly NTA - It's understandable that you want to spend more time with your partner and have synchronized schedules. You're not trying to completely change his routine, but just hoping for a compromise that works for both of you. However, it's also important to consider his perspective and respect his preferences. Slight YTA for being a bit pushy about it though but there was nothing wrong with the request in of itself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People have different internal clocks and you and your boyfriend have different ones, and you need to accept that instead of continually suggesting he change his ways when there\u2019s nothing wrong with them. My wife is a morning person and I\u2019m a night owl. I would absolutely loathe waking up at 6am on a weekend, and she would hate my midnight-1am bedtimes. Neither of us has tried to change the other and we spend every evening and weekend together.", "And he would say EXACTLY the same thing about getting up several hours earlier than normal.

But you expect it to be super easy for him to change his? \n\nYTA, your way is not the only way. I say this as someone who really struggles with early mornings.

Plus, not everyone wants to be \u201cproductive\u201d on weekend mornings.", "So stay up late at night and do things together. Why do these things have to be done only according to your time and your comfort", "To put it bluntly: he likes having that time alone.\n\nPerhaps he\u2019s more introverted than you.

That\u2019s not wasted time for them - that\u2019s time that gives them the mental energy to do other things they love.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case with your boyfriend then he\u2019s already happy with the amount of time you two spend together. This balance works for him.\n\nYou are not just asking him to wake up earlier.

Yes I woke up early for school but I didn't have a choice but that's life. He doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to now that he has choices. Waking up late works for him and he's happy with it. \n\nI think you're really irked that he doesn't think waking up early for you is important enough for him to actually do it.", "If you force your partner to spend every minute of free time with you, they'll get sick of you and leave. Trust me, I've driven away great men because I always needed them around, and they felt like they couldn't be themselves. My friend Tabitha still does this. Listen to reddit, learn to love your boyfriend all the way around, and find friends or activities to do when he's sleeping.", "So plan ahead and ask him to wake up earlier on specific hike days. It\u2019s a lot more reasonable to ask someone to get up for a special occasion than to ask them to do it universally.\n\nI\u2019m wired like he is.
