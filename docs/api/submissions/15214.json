It\u2019s something we usually do every month to catch up. \n\nMy mum would usually make us help with the cooking, like cutting vegetables, washing dishes, etc. I don\u2019t mind this cause I genuinely enjoy family time. \n\nMy BIL is a massive misogynistic prick who thinks women belong in the kitchen. So he always comes up with an excuse to avoid helping my mum in the kitchen. \n\nThis time my mum gave me the task of cutting the vegetables. I told her my bf had been teaching me to cut vegetables properly, so she wanted to see my progress. I obviously wasn\u2019t good enough cause I was still learning, but my sister laughed, saying, this is horrible, and no one will eat ugly chopped lady fingers. My BIL chimed in, saying how my bf is going to dump me cause I\u2019m no wife material. \n\nMy sister \u2018jokingly\u2019 (she claimed it was a joke) told my bf to get a gf that can cook well cause if not, he\u2019s going to end up coming home with horrible food. My bf said he doesn\u2019t expect me to cook as he can do it for us, but my BIL said I would be a horrendous SAHM if I let him do all the job. \n\nBy this time, I was already seeing red, and my brother raised his voice at my sister to tone it down. But she went on and on. I snapped at her and said not everyone wants to be a college dropout and SAHM like you and told my BIL to wash his own socks and undies first before talking. They got humiliated, but my dad kind of calmed everyone down, and I left to go to my room with my bf. \n\nThe dinner was awkward, and soon everyone left. My sister sent me a whole paragraph the next day telling me to apologise to my BIL because my comment hurt him and made him look like a tool in front of my parents. I told her to fuck off. Everyone\u2019s on my side, except my mum. she thinks I should apologise to avoid unnecessary drama. \n\nI want a non-biased opinion. I would apologise if I were the AH.

So what you aren't the best cook in the world, you and your bf are doing what is best for the two of you. You are trying to learn and your bf is what I assume happily teaching you.   Your BIL needs to get over himself. Girl you do you! and do not apologize to him! Your sister and BIL are the ones who should be apologizing to both you and your bf as well as your parents and brother for their childish and inappropriate behavior at the family dinner.", "I mean he sounds like a tool.  He's just mad that everyone saw him for what he is.", "I don't get it. Why should you care about their feelings when neither one of them cared about yours when they were going out of their way to insult and belittle you?\n\nNTA. \n\n\"You don't start something, there won't be something. Get out of my face before something bad happens. Too late.\"\n\nDon't dish it out if you can't take it.\n\nYour mom should have stood up for you when your sister and her husband were smack talking and insulting you.", "NTA", "reply to any text from her with gif Logan Roy saying \"F\\*\\* off\"", "yes\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d i was at their home once and saw that. actually scared the crap \ud83d\udca9 out of me", "Baby wipes after tp wipes no more and you'll get rid of skid marks. Wet wipes I'd a miracle to use it.", "For Sister, possibly some sort of internalised self-loathing / misogyny, would be my guess.\n\nNot necessarily consciously, but there's every chance Sister is actually jealous that OP has a BF who is happy to help her out. There are plenty of women in 'traditional' roles (not all, of course) who tell the world they're doing it \"the right way\" to kind of justify their own misery?", "NTA - if your sister is fine by being a housewife and having a misogynistic husband that\u2019s fine I guess for her. You have every right to stand up for yourself specially when BIL is belittling you in front of your whole family and your bf just because you can\u2019t cook well even though you (from what I understand of this post) want to learn more. Your bf is a king for how he handled the comment and seeing you as his equal not his maid. Don\u2019t apologize, if anything they should apologize to you and your family!! If your mom asked for help, he could\u2019ve helped at least with something minimal just out of respect to his wife\u2019s family and their home. \nI don\u2019t get how there\u2019s still men like BIL\u2026 each to their own I guess but he should\u2019ve kept his comment and your sister to themselves specially cause it makes it seem the wife is not their equal.", "Think we need the \u201crock the boat\u201d meme here. This is what OP is doing - she\u2019s the only one pointing out that the BIL is rocking the boat, not her", "I wonder about that myself. That's telling the victim not to defend themselves because then they are in the wrong.\n\nIf someone is going to behave badly and continue to do so then they can't expect those around them to continue to be their doormats.\n\nTell your mom that you aren't going to be anyone's doormat regardless of who they are. Tell her that it wounds you to know that she would rather condone someone being a bully to you than to support you standing up for yourself.", "Because it's easier to try to plead with the rational person than the irrational drama causing person/people. They know the person causing problems won't actually take accountability, so it's easier to try to get the recipient/victim to apologize. But of course the person causing problems will never learn accountability or change unless they are forced to deal with the consequences. That's a lot of work though, so people default to making the victim \"be the bigger person\" because it's easier. \n\nI was actually forced to \"be the bigger person\" a lot by my parents with my brother and sister in law. Until finally one day they crossed a line and I flat out refused to keep the peace. Went NC with brother and SIL for close to a year. Finally brother came around and apologized. He and SIL are now getting divorced for unrelated reasons, but consistent with the fact that he was able to self reflect and grow up, she is not.", "And let's not forget that sister was told - at least once - to stop. And she didn't.", "This! You 100% deserve dignity and respect, OP! Your mom's idea of family time would be a play-acting miserable sham if you were to apologize to them for calling them out on bullying you. Good for you, OP. Hold firm.", "This! You 100% deserve dignity and respect, OP! Your mom's idea of family time would be a play-acting miserable sham if you were to apologize to them for calling them out on bullying you. Good for you, OP. Hold firm.", "Please tell me that undies comment was about how he's one of those grown ass men that still leaves streaks in his undies", "Yes", "Or the one of Will Smith slapping Chris Rock \"Keep [OP's name] out your f**kin' mouth!\"", "I believe OP is the tool. To quote Captain Holt, \n\"Yes, you're a massive tool. You're useful and valuable.\" \nSounds like BIL is the complete opposite of a tool.", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f", "Hopefully not bad enough to leave streaks like your BIL!", "Tell him he can\u2019t say shit about anything or anyone until he learns to wash his ass properly. \n\nNTA, OP", "That's a good point.", "Aaaaaannddd now I have don't rock the boat baby in my head \ud83e\udd23", "\"Sit down, you'll rock the boat!\"", "At least pet rocks are likeable and useful for putting goggly eyes on and defenses you against AH like BIL.", "I love that song; partly because of the name of the band. The Hues Corporation...where did they come up with that?!", "\"And the devil will drag you under\nBy the sharp lapel of your checkered coat\"", "He\u2019s as useful as a teaspoon with a bunch of holes poked through it", "That would a fart with attachments.", "That's called a shart ;)", "This is the way.", "This is the way.", "This is the way", "This is the way", "Is this the way?", "This is the way"]}
