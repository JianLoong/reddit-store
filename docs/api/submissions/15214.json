And it\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, but no one\u2019s business as I can survive cooking the basics, and my bf doesn\u2019t mind cooking for me. \n\nLast Sunday, my mum invited all of us (me, my bf, my brother, my sister, and her husband) for dinner. It\u2019s something we usually do every month to catch up. \n\nMy mum would usually make us help with the cooking, like cutting vegetables, washing dishes, etc. I don\u2019t mind this cause I genuinely enjoy family time. \n\nMy BIL is a massive misogynistic prick who thinks women belong in the kitchen. So he always comes up with an excuse to avoid helping my mum in the kitchen. \n\nThis time my mum gave me the task of cutting the vegetables. I told her my bf had been teaching me to cut vegetables properly, so she wanted to see my progress. I obviously wasn\u2019t good enough cause I was still learning, but my sister laughed, saying, this is horrible, and no one will eat ugly chopped lady fingers. My BIL chimed in, saying how my bf is going to dump me cause I\u2019m no wife material. \n\nMy sister \u2018jokingly\u2019 (she claimed it was a joke) told my bf to get a gf that can cook well cause if not, he\u2019s going to end up coming home with horrible food. My bf said he doesn\u2019t expect me to cook as he can do it for us, but my BIL said I would be a horrendous SAHM if I let him do all the job. \n\nBy this time, I was already seeing red, and my brother raised his voice at my sister to tone it down. But she went on and on. I snapped at her and said not everyone wants to be a college dropout and SAHM like you and told my BIL to wash his own socks and undies first before talking. They got humiliated, but my dad kind of calmed everyone down, and I left to go to my room with my bf. \n\nThe dinner was awkward, and soon everyone left. My sister sent me a whole paragraph the next day telling me to apologise to my BIL because my comment hurt him and made him look like a tool in front of my parents. I told her to fuck off. Everyone\u2019s on my side, except my mum. she thinks I should apologise to avoid unnecessary drama. \n\nI want a non-biased opinion. I would apologise if I were the AH.
