Two years ago I found out I was pregnant by my abusive boyfriend a week after I decided to leave him. The relationship was horrible as well as emotionally abusive. I had been dating EXBF for about a year in college and it was your stereotypical amazing love story that came to a weird end when he dumped me over text the next summer. I never got over him, the following summer he reached out and apologized and I, idiotically took him back and moved in with him as I still loved him, this second relationship started off the same way but he was different once I moved in. I won't get into the nitty gritty but I ended up needing therapy when it was all said and done. I made the choice to move out while he was in vacation visiting his family in Alaska and later I found out he was cheating on me with a woman twice my age as well. I had already made the decision to leave but he didn't know that so I let him believe it was his idea to end things with me and then I found out I was pregnant. We agreed on an abortion and ultimately I couldn't go through with it after he drove me to the clinic. I told him the baby died on its own because of some drugs I took when I was sad about the breakup and gave him the money back. I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption. 8 1/2 months went by and I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy who I decided to give up for adoption. He was adopted by a beautiful couple and it was a closed adoption as I don't think i could handle ever meeting him bc of who his father is. This angered my family, more specifically my mother because she said if i wanted to give the baby up for adoption she would have taken him. i told her this would make me uncomfortable bc i feel like she would expect me to babysit from time to time and there would be this preconceived notion that at one point i would take the child back as my own. She would not be grandma she would be his mother, I also did not want to have that man's child as my brother as well. I wanted to the rid of all things him. She said it's one thing to give your baby up for adoption but to not let him have any biological connections because i don't want him around is selfish.

Im an adoptee of a closed adoption as well. Having a parent with a large age difference caused extra headaches growing up (1950s vs 1990s) the boy will grow in a loving family that wants him a part of it more than anything.", "Yta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP made a difficult choice that her mother has no right whatsoever to interfere in. I\u2019m assuming your mother is aware of the reason you opted for adoption, but even if she is not, your body = your choice.", "NTA. That boy will have the opportunity to grow up in a loving family with normal-aged parents. You did the right thing.", "NTA.  You were in a hard spot and you made a hard decision, and you made it as well and thoughtfully as you could.\n\nWhen you make tough decisions like this, it is fine to consider yourself and your needs as well as the needs of other people. \n\nI cannot speak to how that kid will feel in the future - life is long and can be strange. But you did the best you could with the place you were in and no one can reasonably ask more from you.", "NTA. This was your baby, your decision and I for one think it's very brave what you did. Your mother doesn't seem to care about your feelings at all, she is the selfish one here.", "NTA.  OP made the best choice for the child and her own mental health.  This wasn't mom's call to make and her making a tough choice even harder makes her an AH.\n\nIf mom was that grand baby crazy, there's no telling where that energy goes.  Insisting on OP caring for it?  Secretly pushing for OP to be a mom to it?  Getting in contact with the Ex or his relatives because they're \"FAMILY?\"  Telling the kid stuff later in life?  Nope yourself right out of that situation.", "NTA. You made the best choice for you and your baby. You really put thought into it, and made a very difficult decision. When your child is older, if he wants a connection he will try and find you. There are so many DNA kits out there, he will most likely buy one if he really wants to meet some family. If your mom really wants she can easily buy one herself and see if he ever matches with her. Closed adoptions are not staying as \"closed\" as they once were. I should know, I gifted my mom one(as she was interested in her family history) and she found out through a match that she had a half-sister that my grandma had put up for adoption. Although they didn't meet for nearly 50 years, they are now friends.", "Definitely not the asshole. In all honestly your mom is being selfish. Baby will have a much better life with a nice couple than he would with granny wondering why mom didn't want him.", "NTA,  I can only imagine the drama that would have happened if your mom adopted the baby.  So many unkind things would have come from it, including the ex probably finding out.  The baby is more protected this way, you made a good choice.", "NTA. You made the best choice for that baby and your mental health. Your mother is an AH because the only opinion that even matters in a situation like this, is YOURS. She can put on a cape and get super mad about it, but you still did the right thing \u2764\ufe0f good luck OP", "NTA. Every decision you made put the child\u2019s interests first. I feel bad for your mom, but the child is better off living their life undiscovered by their bio father. If your mom adopted the baby, odds are good that your ex or someone in his family would figure it out.", "NTA. You gave both you and that baby a chance. You made the best decisions you could for you both.", "NTA well sorry and fuck this was rough to read but you made the best choice I think.", "NTA - given the story you probably did what\u2019s best for you and the baby - he has a loving family and you get to leave the past entirely behind. If that\u2019s what you wanted I don\u2019t see why your mom would want to keep that part of the past around - would just come to haunt you and the boy later in life.", "NTA- you made a good decision and have done your best to give the child a good start to life. Very responsible, and NTA.", "NTA \n\nIt was your choice to make. You chose the family you thought best for the baby. Seeing the baby and interacting with baby sounds like it would harm you mentally. If child wants a connection, they can seek out DNA testing at 18 if they want, because let\u2019s face it. With 23&Me and other sites, it\u2019s hard to hide your DNA anymore.", "NTA - you did what was right for you for both the short and long term. Baby has parents who love him and will be happy. It\u2019s your body, It\u2019s 100% your decision.", "Hmmm.  So you lied to the father and told him the baby died but instead gave the child up for adoption without telling him?   \n\nDepending on state law, fathers who don't consent to the adoption of their child should file an objection to the adoption in the appropriate court, or in some cases with their state's health and human services department.  Then they can often take the child back from the adoptive family.", "This was your choice to make and you made it. Sounds like the baby\u2019s adoptive parents are good people. Your mom doesn\u2019t get a vote. NTA.", "NTA-you were incredibly unselfish to give the boy the best parents possible. Your mom will never understand this (who wants to be told that she\u2019s not good enough?) but she doesn\u2019t get a say. Your mom is the AH for bringing it up at all. Suggest she get therapy so she doesn\u2019t have to talk to you about it (or do joint therapy).", "A closed adoption was the safest thing for you and for the baby, when the father is abusive. Otherwise, he could potentially sue for visitation rights, custody, etc\u2026 \n\nBUT more importantly, this was your decision to make.\n\nNTA", "NTA in any way. You\u2019re still healing from what sounds like an abusive relationship and, although some get healing from having the child, not everyone does. You did what was best for you AND your child right now.", "You put my feelings in better words right here. This was my biggest fear", "he wanted my child to not exist. I doubt he will try to take him from his adoptive parents.", "Google \u201cBaby Richard\u201d or maybe \u201cBaby Richard Illinois\u201d. That was an ugly situation."]}
