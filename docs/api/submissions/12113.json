You sound like a very nice person, but it's totally okay to have boundaries with people and to stand up for yourself. Don't let others walk all over you because you're too nice to say *no.*\n\nRegardless of whether he asked you beforehand, your sister's boyfriend should *not* ever have used *your* celebration as an opportunity to propose. That is so rude and, honestly, it just shows that he is lazy and thoughtless because he didn't want to make the effort to plan out something special for your sister.\n\nWhat he said to you is not okay and he is *way* out of line. He owes you an apology and I hope your sister gives some serious thought before going through with marrying someone who loses his temper and lashes out so easily. That is very concerning.", "Me likey your brain!! \ud83d\ude02", "definitely not. Look i really dont care about whether im being celebrated. i Just wanted people to have fun at my party. it was more of gatherings than to celebrate me.

Men are every bit as capable of \"thinking\" and having basic manners and social skills as women are. That has nothing to do with gender. He doesn't get a free pass to go around being as entitled and rude as he likes simply because he's \"a guy.\"  \n\nA marriage proposal is a big deal and it's not something you do at someone else's special event. It's incredibly inconsiderate and selfish to make yourself the center of attention at another person's celebration.", " Sure, plenty of people aren't socially aware... but what really makes him an asshole is not apologising but calling her a jealous bitch when it was pointed out how it was inconsiderate.", "That's exactly what I thought. \n\nYou have every right to be upset that not only was he inconsiderate, instead of owning it, he tried to throw it on you as if any of this is your fault.
