When I was a kid playing in my parents yard with my friends and we accidentally hit or kicked a ball into her yard she'd have a fit. Even though it wasn't anywhere near her house.  We didn't run through her yard or anything either,  just went to bring the ball back.\n\n\nWhen I was in high school she'd tell my parents on me about stuff that they already knew.  Like I was allowed to stay out til midnight or 1am (I can't remember exactly) the night of homecoming. The next morning she came over  to tell me mom she seen me \"sneaking in\" late. \n\nShe's done other stuff but I don't feel like writing a book.  \n\nNow that I'm \"grown \" she's tried having a friendly conversation with me just if we cross paths outside but I'm always very short with her because she's a nosey tattle tale.  \n\nI guess her husband and her are divorcing (shocker).\n\nI was out raking Sunday and she was walking to her car and said \"hey do mine when you're done\". I ignored her. \n\nMonday she caught me coming home from school and asked if I'd be able to rake her yard.  I said \"sure. But it'll be like 20-30 bucks\". She said \"I  meant just do it as a favor. \" I said \"oh then no\" and went inside. \n\nI guess she said something to my mom and my mom said I should do it to help her out.  \n\nI said no. I'm not helping someone that acted like that when I was a kid and besides she doesn't do anything for me so... \n\nMy mom said that her husband isn't around anymore to do that stuff and Trudy needs help.  That it'd be a good way to build bridges and show my maturity.  I said \"no, I don't want to build a bridge with her and I'd rather she thinks I'm immature. Then she'll leave me alone. I have nothing to say to her anyway\". \n\nMy mom said I'm being stubborn and I should do it for her if I don't do it for Trudy. \n\nAITA for refusing?

Who fixed the car when it needed maintenance? Me. Just because there isn't something dangling between my legs doesn't mean I as a woman am not capable of doing physical labor.

My kids are mostly grown now, and we had a neighbor that was wretched to them for years. This neighbor acted horribly to all the kids, not just mine.
