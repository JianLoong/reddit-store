We didn't run through her yard or anything either,  just went to bring the ball back.\n\n\nWhen I was in high school she'd tell my parents on me about stuff that they already knew.

I ignored her. \n\nMonday she caught me coming home from school and asked if I'd be able to rake her yard.  I said \"sure. But it'll be like 20-30 bucks\". She said \"I  meant just do it as a favor. \" I said \"oh then no\" and went inside. \n\nI guess she said something to my mom and my mom said I should do it to help her out.  \n\nI said no. I'm not helping someone that acted like that when I was a kid and besides she doesn't do anything for me so... \n\nMy mom said that her husband isn't around anymore to do that stuff and Trudy needs help.  That it'd be a good way to build bridges and show my maturity.  I said \"no, I don't want to build a bridge with her and I'd rather she thinks I'm immature. Then she'll leave me alone. I have nothing to say to her anyway\". \n\nMy mom said I'm being stubborn and I should do it for her if I don't do it for Trudy. \n\nAITA for refusing?
