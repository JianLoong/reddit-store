Did you also stick your tongue out at your ex and say, \"You ain't the boss of me!\"?\n\nCoparenting requires a team effort. Your ex had a valid reason for not wanting to give your daughter a PS5 right away. Because she was ridiculing her peers who are less fortunate than her. And I think that's an appropriate punishment. Don't you think that it's appropriate to deny her certain privileges if she's going to bully and ridicule others who don't have her privilege?\n\nAnd there are other ways you could have rewarded your daughter.

Even though you are her father, you have to consider the co-parenting aspect of your relationship with your ex. Your ex asked you not to buy a PS5 for your daughter, and you did it anyway, which can create conflict and undermine the trust and communication necessary to successfully co-parent. Furthermore, your daughter's behavior was clearly concerning to your ex, and you did not address that in any way. It's important to consider the impact your actions can have on the whole family dynamic, not just your relationship with your daughter. You could have used this situation as a teaching moment for your daughter to be more empathetic towards her siblings and to consider their feelings, but instead, you chose to prioritize her desires over the family's wellbeing.", "You wanted to reward your daughter for a good grade in a hard test.

Your child is gloating about having better privileges than her half-siblings and that's not the kind of behavior that should be fed. Academic achievement imo shouldn't incur substantial financial rewards as that's not how the world works. Pretty well any job I can think of requires more intrapersonal intelligence than book smarts. At fourteen years old it's fairly clear your daughter has room for improvement in that category that you've (in this case willfully) neglected to foster. Standardized testing pretty well just translates to the ability to fill out forms which isn't a noteworthy skill. Perhaps iy could have been a household console instead of a personal one... Sounds like your daughter is fairly possessive so perhaps the knowledge of it being yours that she can use wouldn't have led to immediate bragging.\nOutside of that glaring issue under normal circumstances I don't think your ex has a right to say which amenities your daughter can enjoy when she stays with you. Kind of an AH thing to demand that her child be bound to the standard of living that she can currently provide when her household is struggling because it can rob your kid of experiences.", "YTA..\n\nYour ex specifically told you not to get the PS5 and explained her reasons why\u2026\n\nYou should have returned the PS5 you bought a few weeks back, but instead you just went and did the very thing your ex asked you not to do..\n\nThat\u2019s not being a dad, that\u2019s being childish\u2026", "NTA if you keep the PS5 at your house.

Sad for all involved.", ">why do I never have these problems with her? \n\nObviously, I can't speak for your daughter, but I'll offer you some insight as a kid of divorce.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 8. Probably worth noting that back then, it was the norm here in Denmark, that mom had the kid fulltime and dad got to spend a full weekend with the kid every 14 days, which probably explains a bit as to why he probably wasn't the disciplinarian that he should've been. 4 full days a month, and you're going to spend it disciplining your kid? Nah - we'll do fun stuff instead.\n\nBy the time I was 12, I was very well aware that I liked my dad more than my mom. No only because I knew that he made more fun stuff - in the summer we went to the beach, out in nature, sailed on his boat etc. or just plain old games and tv. My dad gave me everything that I wanted, plus as I was going through puberty, he knew how to handle me. I also knew very well that he provided me with all of the fun stuff that I wanted, so I did **everything** to not go out of line.\n\nMy mom though? She was very strict. I couldn't watch tv, we \"never had money\" (we did, but she spent it on her shoe-addiction lol), which meant that I had zero fun at her house. Amongst other things, she also didn't come to terms with me growing up, which meant that she tried to infantalize me and have me as her \"little boy\" .... yeah.... this was early 2000s by the way, so I looked like Avril Lavigne x My Chemical Romance had a baby. I wasn't a very nice kid to her, and I didn't even bother trying to behave when I was home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ask yourself this question: Do you **actually** discipline your daughter when she's at your house?   \nI'm not talking a full on WWE smackdown, but being firm with her and telling her like *\"you cannot wipe the floor with your stepsister's toothbrush, because it's disgusting and she needs to use it.\"*  and giving her a penalty like \"no PC for you this week/weekend\", and that means standing firm and **not** giving in when she whines and cries. \n\nObviously she's going to be nice at your house, if all you do is provide the fun stuff - and of course she's going to misbehave at her mother's house, if she doesn't get attention there and only gets yelled at. (kid logic: why bother, when parent is gonna yell anyway?)\n\nIf you can see this is somewhat familiar to what's going on now, I would try and sit down with her and have a talk.   \n\\- You mentioned that they got younger children along with step-children in your ex's home. Maybe she's acting out at her mothers house, because there's just too much stress going on. Many people living together tends to make things go or feel a little more fast paced than usual.  \n\\- None of the kids in the house are around her age, so she can't really play with them. I assume that she gets along with your stepdaughter, because they're around the same age. She could be missing a play-partner.   \n\\- Or perhaps her stepfather isn't so nice towards her.  \nSadly, it's not too uncommon that stepparents with their own children from a previous relationship and/or from the new relationship, tend to hold a grudge towards their partners child(ren).", "\"why do I never have these problems with her?\"\n\nBecause you're the cash parent she can manipulate with good behavior while she's at your place to get expensive stuff?\n\nNTA but wow you and the ex need to learn to co-parent a bit better.
