One parent doesn't get to dictate to the other but her point was valid. It's just you guys should have discussed and agreed but that's probably a big part of why you're not together.

Did you also stick your tongue out at your ex and say, \"You ain't the boss of me!\"?\n\nCoparenting requires a team effort. Your ex had a valid reason for not wanting to give your daughter a PS5 right away. Because she was ridiculing her peers who are less fortunate than her. And I think that's an appropriate punishment. Don't you think that it's appropriate to deny her certain privileges if she's going to bully and ridicule others who don't have her privilege?\n\nAnd there are other ways you could have rewarded your daughter. You could have taken her out for ice cream, given her something else as a reward, tell her how proud you are of her, etc.\n\nAll without undercutting your ex.\n\nFace it, you did this to spite your ex and convince your daughter that you're the \"good parent\" and your ex is the \"bad parent.\"\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, YTA.\n\nETA: Just bear in mind, undercutting each other is a two-way street. So, don't be surprised if you impose a punishment on your daughter for whatever reason, and your ex decides, \"You ain't the boss of me!\"", "YTA. Even though you are her father, you have to consider the co-parenting aspect of your relationship with your ex.

Furthermore, your daughter's behavior was clearly concerning to your ex, and you did not address that in any way. It's important to consider the impact your actions can have on the whole family dynamic, not just your relationship with your daughter. You could have used this situation as a teaching moment for your daughter to be more empathetic towards her siblings and to consider their feelings, but instead, you chose to prioritize her desires over the family's wellbeing.", "You wanted to reward your daughter for a good grade in a hard test.

Your child is gloating about having better privileges than her half-siblings and that's not the kind of behavior that should be fed. Academic achievement imo shouldn't incur substantial financial rewards as that's not how the world works. Pretty well any job I can think of requires more intrapersonal intelligence than book smarts. At fourteen years old it's fairly clear your daughter has room for improvement in that category that you've (in this case willfully) neglected to foster. Standardized testing pretty well just translates to the ability to fill out forms which isn't a noteworthy skill. Perhaps iy could have been a household console instead of a personal one... Sounds like your daughter is fairly possessive so perhaps the knowledge of it being yours that she can use wouldn't have led to immediate bragging.\nOutside of that glaring issue under normal circumstances I don't think your ex has a right to say which amenities your daughter can enjoy when she stays with you. Kind of an AH thing to demand that her child be bound to the standard of living that she can currently provide when her household is struggling because it can rob your kid of experiences.", "YTA..\n\nYour ex specifically told you not to get the PS5 and explained her reasons why\u2026\n\nYou should have returned the PS5 you bought a few weeks back, but instead you just went and did the very thing your ex asked you not to do..\n\nThat\u2019s not being a dad, that\u2019s being childish\u2026", "NTA if you keep the PS5 at your house.
