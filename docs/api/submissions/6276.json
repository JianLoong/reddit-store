He always got what he wanted, or he threw tantrums, even at my sister\u2019s funeral (she was 16. Ben 14, me 11).\n\nMy dad has 2 brothers and 1 sister. When my uncle was 22, he came out as gay. My grandparents (GPs) were shocked but they loved and accepted him for who he was. My Dad married my Mum and with my uncle, did lots together. To us he was the fun uncle. My aunt and other uncle married their partners but they were always critical of my other uncle because of his life choices. My GPs held the family together but in 2016, they both died within 9 months of each other. My aunt and uncle disowned my gay uncle. He was upset but he and my Dad have always been close, so we became his only family. In 2019, my uncle was diagnosed with lung cancer. He rewrote his will and asked my brother to be executor because Dad wasn\u2019t coping with him being sick. Ben accepted as he believed that my uncle would split everything between him and myself.\n\nMy uncle died in May 2021. My Dad, my uncle's boyfriend and I were with him. I called and messaged my brother repeatedly, but he didn't answer or come to say goodbye. At the funeral, Dad was a mess but my brother was giddy. A couple of weeks of my brother pestering my Dad to find the will later, we looked in my uncle\u2019s safe. Dad unlocked it and Ben grabbed the paperwork. Soon after, he swiped everything off my uncle's desk, swore, yelled and stormed out. Later I found the will and my uncle had split his estate 4 ways. 1/4 each to my brother, myself, my uncle\u2019s boyfriend and cancer research. Ben was angry because he only got 1/4. He contested the will. He claimed that he only accepted the job of executor because he was promised 1/2. He believed he should get 1/2 and the other 1/2 should be split 3 ways. It went to court in October 2022. I testified, and when asked if my brother should get 1/2 of the estate because of \"all the work\" he had to do, I said no. I said my dad and I had done more than my brother helping my uncle simplify his affairs prior to his death and that my uncle was a deliberate man, and we should respect his wishes. Ben was livid but still thought he would win. He didn't. Early December I was notified that Ben got 1/4 minus costs, and the rest of us got 1/4 each.\n\nHe went nuts demanding I compensate him because I cost him \"his\" money. My mother blew up my phone with \"how could I do this to her baby\" and relatives are telling me I did the wrong thing. Mum banned me from Christmas (my parents divorced when I was 16) because of my \"poor behaviour\" and told everyone I refused to come after what I did. Ben had a NYE party and my SIL sent me a message saying \u201csorry\u201d with a picture of my photo on Ben\u2019s dartboard and a sign telling his guests to throw darts at me and to message my number and tell me I\u2019m an AH.

You indicate that he did nothing prior to your uncle's death like being a full time caretaker that even would justify such a division.\n\nYour brother cost the estate money by challenging it which is why a so-called \"in terrorem\" clause is often inserted which leaves $1 or other small amount to anyone who challenges the Will to prevent this kind of useless and expensive litigation. \n\nThe terms of the Will indicated that your uncle knew exactly what he was doing - he knew the natural objects of his bounty and the division made absolute sense.

But that still doesnt turn 1/4 into 1/2.\n\nWhen I took a Wills & Estates class, we learned how often families break up due to two factors:\n\n1) whatever a person gives/doesnt give/says in their will is taken to mean that is an expression of their last word on how they feel about people.  Sometimes parents leave 0 to a wealthy sibling, for example, because they \"dont need it\", without realizing how traumatizing that can be.  Therefore people often split into equal parts.

Wow Ben is something else though and it\u2019s not good.", "NTA", "Yeah good riddance to your brother. I\u2019d honestly file a restraining order against your SIL, brother, and mother. Include the dartboard picture and the messages. These people are horrible. NTA.", "NTA - of course .. ..  but your brother's behavior and your mom's support of him makes me worried for you. Throwing darts at your face? Asking his friends and family to attack you?\n\nHe sounds dangerous and so does your mother. I'm sorry. Stay away from those people!", "NTA.  Oh my dear, I'm so sorry you got stuck with such an awful family.  I think you'll be much better off if you go NC with your mother and the dreadful son she created through her terrible parenting, as well as any relatives who support them.  Honestly, cancel them.  They have nothing to offer you.  You deserve to be surrounded by people who are kind and caring; they don't qualify.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right not to let that AH steal your inheritance.", "NTA your brother chose to go to court which is already an expensive endeavor. He\u2019s the reason he didn\u2019t receive his full 1/4 of the inheritance.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t LIE under oath for your brother \u2014 that was your \u201ccrime.\u201d You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You are not obligated to spoil him unfairly like your mom did/does. He actually thinks he should get more than the uncle\u2019s partner? Ugh! What a brat!", "NTA. Your mother and brother sound like horrible people. Do you actually want them in your life? Maybe take this as the gift it is and go NC.", "Time to start a new family, you, your dad and your uncles boyfriend. Let go of mom and her golden boy, you don't need that kind of energy in your life.", "NTA. Sorry about the loss of your uncle. I\u2019m less sorry about the loss of your mother and brother, they sound awful.", "NTA you gave an honest account of what your brother did to a court and they decided he was only entitled to what he was granted in the will. The decision was out your hands. Your brother tried to be greedy and lost. That\u2019s all on him. Block the numbers of any random that messages and it might be wise to do the same to your mum and your brother", "Defo NTA.. last wishes of your dying uncle was to split the inheritance as declared .. you simply supported that .. plus the toxic shit after .. steer clear", "NTA. But your brother is. Take your inheritance, screw him.", "NTA! You didn't \"rob\" your brother of anything. The money was your Uncle's to distribute how he wished and his wishes were honored as they should be. You already know that legally you are in the clear. You are also morally good as well. Good riddance to bad rubbish honestly. It hurts to have strife in our families. It hurts more to continue to subject yourself to abuse from \"family\". Block harassing hate messages and keep your peace and wellbeing. So sorry for your losses and stand strong in your truth!", "NTA  you stood by your uncle.  If mom wants to close her eyes to his behavior now, then wait till she needs help and he not there.  She will be crying to you about brother.", "NTA screw them. You do not need so-called family in your life like that. Who cares how much your brother bitches and moans don't give him a dime. If I were you, I would also change my phone number as well. Let your father and anyone else in your family who you choose to give your new number to know that they are not to give it to your mother or your brother or anyone who would pass it along to either one of them.", "NTA. \n\nBen sounds like cancer. Your family sounds toxic as hell minus your dad. New year. Go NC with them.", "Please do yourself a favor and cut your mom and brother out of your life. They are not good people and neither seem to love you anyway. NTA", "NTA and cut everyone harassing you off including your mother.", "NTA bloody hell your brother is an insufferable disgusting human being! Being giddy that his uncle died so he could steal the money he thought he was entitled to.", "NTA. Your brother robbed himself of his full inheritance by contesting the will. Karma came back and but him in the ass by making him pay the fees.", "NTA, you respected your uncle\u2019s wishes.\n\nFun (maybe) fact: here in Quebec, when you write your will, you only get a copy, the original is held in the office of the profession Order for notaries.  There no such thing as \u201clooking for the will\u201d and there\u2019s no debate as to which one is the \u201ccorrect version\u201d", "NTA \n\nWhat a toxic family. No amount of inheritance would fix your brother.", "Who would guess someone who is spoiled would have this attitud. NTA", "NTA.", "I don't see where you owe him anything, if your uncle wanted him to have it, he would have given it to him. Your brother sounds like a jealous ass. I'd just laugh it off, all the way to the bank!", "NTA I wonder why your Dad divorced your Mum /s \n\nYour brother is dreadful, and deserved to lose money.", "NTA, and cut your mother and brother off. They're incredibly toxic and abusive and you'll be much better off without them. Ben deserved to lose money and your mother deserved to get divorced.", "NTA and I'd take the photo as evidence that you need a restraining order against them. then if anyone asks why you don't go to family gatherings, point to the photo and restraining orders.\n\nIt's time for FAFO.", "Nta, you should absolutely not give him anything. Sounds like you are better off without him and your mum in your life.", "Ben could have declined to serve as executor and the next person named would be in charge of it. No need for Ben to throw a hissy fit.", "NTA.  I'm sorry that you lost your uncle and your family in one fell swoop.  You deserve better than all of them, their behaviour is digusting and downright stupid.  Your brother would have been entitled to a fee if he had done his job properly, instead he cost himself money.  \n\nGo to therapy and leave them to each other.  Your parents will regret what they've done when they need elder care and your brother abandons them too.  I hope that you're strong enough to not feel guilty about it by that point, because they do not deserve you.  You don't treat people that you love the way they have treated you.", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother used a portion of his full inheritance to contest the will in court and lost. He cost himself his inheritance and both he and your mother are terrible people.", "NTA cut off your mother and brother now they sound horrible. If your father decides to change his will make sure he has as many safe guards as he can as you already know your brother is litigious.", "So your mom (and brother) think you are TA for refusing to help your brother steal from you, your uncle's boyfriend, and cancer research? \n\nYou are NTA, but your brother and mom sure are.", "Yea, they are, but aren\u2019t such people paid to do so? That\u2019s the angle Ben was trying for.", "He couldn\u2019t even make the effort to pretend to be grieving", "He didnt show up to his passing and acted \u201cgiddy\u201d at the funeral? what a little fucking piece of human shit.", "The daughters weren't in the moms will. You're cute.", "You\u2019re NTA and it sounds like it\u2019s time to block your mom and brother. You don\u2019t need toxic people like that in your life", "Personally, I'd hire a lawyer, and have the lawyer reach out to the cops as well as getting those phone numbers linked to persons. Then get cease and desist letters sent. Probably not much would come from it, but it'd thoroughly document the harassment, which would be important if the brother escalated. \n\nBut that's me. Probably the best option is to block their numbers, and move on. You have your dad. Sorry your uncle didn't see your brother for who he is and that he left him even a dime. Do something with what your uncle left you to build a new and happier life.", "It\u2019s looks like your family is your dad and your uncles partner now. I hope they ice your brother out hard. All I could think during this post was eff this guy.", "At least you have no illusions of her. Hopefully, you\u2019ll be able to cut off all contact with her. Greed can easily backfire and I hope that happens to her.", "Yep! Brother paid a stupid tax for his greed. He got less than what was willed to him due to paying fees for contesting a valid testamentary document and did not get that extra for his time spent on being executor. What a mess.", "Make sure your SIL knows your there for her if you need help. Your brother isn't -- right in the head.", "They might consider their work a gift to the family in a difficult time. Not all consideration needs to be financial.", "$2.00 is too generous for that SOB.", "Honestly, OP could maybe even look into a restraining order on her brother based on that and his harassment.", "Your mother and your brother both know you well and I would say they know that you\u2019re vulnerable right now. Invest in some security in case they come around to harass you. If you\u2019ve caved in to their demands before, they will expect it now. Protect yourself. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and proud of you for standing up for your loving uncle.", "Also extremely entitled.", "My dad is slowly dying of a horrible degenerative disease (Parkinson\u2019s). I\u2019m due to inherit a lot of money when he does die (7 figures). I would give up every cent if it meant getting my dad back whole and healthy.", "Add \"sucking it up\" when abuse happens because somehow you think you deserve it. If you had been like the golden child, this wouldn't have happened. If you hadn't done this to the golden child, this wouldn't have happened. \n\nIt took so many years of therapy to see how toxic my upbringing was.", "I feel you on that.", "Exactly. I saw it as OP understanding that her viewpoint may be somewhat biased, and as a very mature approach by someone setting themselves up for Internet Judgment.", "A good counsellor, or even a private therapist if you can afford one, will work wonders. You don\u2019t need to stick with the first one you meet, so you can take some time to find out who you can connect with well. Not only will you be able to work through things that have happened, and those relationships, it\u2019s also a space to talk about or vent and allow yourself to be vulnerable, so you don\u2019t overload your friends or other loved ones with it.\n\nFake it till you make it is always a great start though, in terms of building resilience."]}
