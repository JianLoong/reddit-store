Why didn't she go to one of the 5 shows that have already been in her city? She wasn't even going to pay you for the ticket, they are outrageously expensive here, that is some entitled Aunt you have.", "NTA. Why would anyone be entitled to any one of your tickets? Especially for Taylor Swift. Those are not cheap.", "NTA. Who would even take her even if you did give up your ticket?", "NTA How is a 10 year old going alone to this  concert? Your group of friends would not be taking her, so this does not make any sense.", "NTA - Your tickets, your choice. Nobody is entitled to them.", "NTA your fam split on what? You spending and planning a concert YOU spent money for? Nahhh they got me F up.", "She wants you to \u201cgive up\u201d your ticket -as in here, kiddo, here is a ticket worth hundreds of dollars that I went to all kinds of trouble to get? Or are they offering to *pay* you for that ticket that cost hundreds of dollars. Because there is a biiiiig difference.\n\nBut I would still say no. Ten year olds can live with disappointments.\n\nBut really, now, let\u2019s look at how this might work, if the ten year old got your ticket. You say you were going to these three concerts with different friend groups. You have *one* ticket. Is the ten year old supposed to go by herself? Is your friend group going to be babysitting some random ten year old all night? If I was in your friend group, I would be introducing anybody that floated the idea  to the phrase, \u201cOh, hell no\u201d. NTA", "NTA. The aunt could have bought a ticket just like you did. Don\u2019t let them bully you. Also, maybe I\u2019m old, but are there many 10 year olds going to the concert? Seems young for that sort of thing", "So you give up your ticket to the 10 year old. Now what? How is this child going to get from the US to Europe?  Who will accompany her to the concert? Will she enjoy herself with a bunch of strange adults who don't speak her language?\n\nNTA and your aunt is a loon.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how this would ever work.

Then she should accept whatever decision you make.", "NTA, but it is NOT easy to get Taylor Swift tickets in the US without paying insane prices. If she wanted to go that badly she should have asked if you would be willing to sell them tickets. \n\nThree shows is a lot given how hard her tickets are to get, but you aren\u2019t in the wrong to not give her one.", "NTA. This is not your responsibility.", "NTA. You bought yourself a ticket. There is nothing wrong with that. They are yours and you get to chose what to do with them. If you want to go, then go.", "NTA I understand these tickets are hard to come by and your aunt has not put any effort in securing one for her daughter. Sorry.", "NTA\n\nThe aunt's request is just entitled and ridiculous. She expects her 10yo be there alone? Or she's already appointed you as her guardian?", "NTA. If your aunt wants a ticket, your aunt can buy a ticket.", "NTA Tell your Aunt that it is HER place to please her 10 yr old, not yours and that is manipulative of her to even suggest that you do so.\nIf your family gives your grief look at them and say \" You buy her the ticket, if you feel so badly\"", "So\u2026 who would your cousin go with, since she doesn\u2019t know any of your friends? That\u2019s what you should be asking your aunt and anyone who questions your decision not to give up your ticket. Would they expect a 10 year old to go to a concert alone in an unfamiliar city in a country she doesn\u2019t live in?\n\nNTA", "So, if I'm understanding this story right. Your aunt who has a kid that lives in the US wants you, who lives in Europe, to give up a ticket for a concert in Europe for her US kid?", "NTA\n\nYou bought tickets.  Those are your tickets\n\nAunt has had chance to buy tickets, those are NOT her tickets.\n\nLet her harangue someone else to give her THEIR tickets.", "How is this aunt planning on shipping cousin, who is TEN, to Europe? Then where is she staying? Who is taking her to the concert?\n\nNTA, sucks that cousin doesn't get to see Taylor Swift but aunt could buy her tickets if she wanted to go instead of likely making other people care for her kid and/or imposing on them for something that belongs to you.", "NTA\nAre you sure your aunt won't try to scalp that ticket -- or go herself? \n\nThe 10 year old needs an adult parent or guardian to go to a concert. Where's the second ticket gonna come from?\n\nYou'll still have two tickets if you give in. Next, you'll be asked to surrender your second ticket because you showed you were a pushover.\n\nLesson: keep possession of Taylor Swift tickets a secret.", "What US city did she play at 5 times ?", "So your aunt is going to ship her 10 year old halfway across the world to go to a concert by herself? \nYea, sorry. I'm going with complete bs on this story. \nOh, YTA", "NTA\n\nWho is supposed to take care of the 10 year old at the concert? I suppose one of your friends is supposed to give up their ticket too?", "NAH\n\n1. The US tour is already over and getting tickets was nigh impossible without paying $1000+ per ticket\n2. You are already going to 3 shows in a row.\n\nSo I don't think they are the assholes for asking assuming that she is willing to pay for the flights and everything for the kid to go\n\nBut you are not the asshole for saying no", "You\u2019re not the asshole for specifically not giving your ticket away to a 10 year old, but with how sought after tickets were for this concert and how difficult it was for genuine fans to go see her, I honestly think it\u2019s morally wrong to go to 3 of the same shows for the tour. It\u2019s just selfish.", "She can watch it in the theatre \ud83e\udd23", "I would say NTA _but_ going three times? That\u2019s a bit extra.", "NTA", "You have 3 tickets to the same show on different dates.  You may not be an asshole but you also aren\u2019t being a good person.\n\nThere are many reasons why your cousin may not be able to go in the states.  You have an opportunity to do something nice, the shows will literally be the exact same three times, you could easily give her the middle date ticket and it would make no difference to you while giving your cousin possibly the night of her life.\n\nWhat would Taylor do?", "She can barely sing. She can\u2019t dance. She ain\u2019t got no ass. Swift is lame.", "YTA, but maybe not for the reasons you\u2019re asking about.  An adult being obsessed with another adult they don\u2019t even know seems unhealthy.  Same with thinking you need to go see the EXACT same show three nights in a row.  Particularly when many fans won\u2019t even get to see the show once because of people hoarding and scalping tickets.  Would be nice to see people thinking about others once in a while- after all,  if you can be obsessed with someone you don\u2019t know, surely it wouldn\u2019t be a giant leap to be considerate to someone you don\u2019t know.", "Yta for having terrible musical taste.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But as a person you're certainly seem like a selfish AH. These tickets were nearly impossible to get in the US no matter how many shows were played in each area. They were all bought up then resold for an astronomical amount. So I don't think your aunt is wrong for thinking you could forego one night when you already have tickets to 2 other nights and I'm assuming your aunt would pay you back the same amount you paid. Again, they're your tickets to do what you want with them but if it were me I'd see if one of my friends in one group could take my ticket for another night and take my cousin. You'd still see taylor twice and no one else would be out of a ticket.", "The cousin is 10. Even if OP did give up the ticket, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get in without an adult (policy for this show is 16 and up without an adult).

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say OP isn\u2019t a good person when the aunt didn\u2019t do any planning and just demanded to take the OPs ticket since it was easier than trying to get her own tickets.", "Who is going to watch the 10 year old while she is at the concert?
