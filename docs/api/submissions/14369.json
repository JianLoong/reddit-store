I (23M) have an older brother who I'll call John (24M) who I've always been really close with. He is with his fianc\u00e9e Jane (24F) and they will be getting married very soon. Jane has always had a very good relationship with our family and the same is true for John with Jane's family. They were best friends as little kids, high-school sweethearts, and even went to college together. Needless to say, both sides of the family are all very exited for the wedding. I should also mention that the community I'm from is a conservative christian one. It's not like my family expects Jane to forgo her career in order to be a SAHM or something like that but things like marriage and having children are strongly encouraged.  \n\n\nLast weekend was John's bachelor party. It was nothing too crazy, just a nice steak dinner with some of his closest friends, myself included, and the night ended with everyone enjoying some drinks by a campfire. Eventually, after everyone had left, it was just me and John at the campfire. John seemed to be a lot more drunk than he usually gets. He started telling me that he was having second thoughts about the wedding. I told him that those feelings are normal but it was clear to me that he loved Jane very much and I'm sure they would have a great marriage. He then told me something that really shocked me. He said that although he feels a strong kinship with Jane, he has never been attracted to her. He said he thinks he is gay and only started dating Jane as a sort of coping mechanism to deny this fact to himself and to hide it from our community. Although I would always love my brother, I can't say how the rest of my family would react. He told me that I am the only person who knows and made me promise not to tell anyone. He said that he'll probably have to go ahead with the wedding and just carry his secret to the grave. I tried to talk this through with him some more but at that point, we was too drunk and inconsolable to listen to anything I was saying so I just took him home and helped him to bed.  \n\n\nI am strongly considering telling Jane what John told me because I care about her and don't want her to be in this situation. If I do tell her, it might make me the AH because John might be disowned by our judgemental community. I know Jane doesn't deserve to be in this situation but it's not John's fault he was and still is subjected to these heteronormative societal pressures.

But if this blows up (and if my experience with this type of communities is anything to go by \u2014 I\u2019m from one and also \ud83c\udf08) then your brother might well be fucked and excised.\n\nNo matter what you choose here you\u2019ll hurt someone and loose. You care for Jane and your Brother, and no matter what happens in this shitty situation life has thrown at your families someone (probably everyone) is gonna get hurt to some extent\n\nSo find a different choice. You can\u2019t really be the one to say shit about this, and I would argue it\u2019d be more AH to say a secret that isn\u2019t yours, than it would be to hide it.

Then see if you can get him to open up and help him explore those emotions.\n\nI\u2019d suggest also finding a way to maybe see a therapist for a day or something, see a professional in the matters of the mind and live like this. If only for peace of mind. Maybe he realises he is and that hiding it is a bad idea, or maybe he realises otherwise. At least then you\u2019d give him the power to decide his own destiny. \n\nFinally, and take it from a \ud83c\udf08guy.

I never really had that much pressure to date women, always felt more comfortable bucking the trend in the pursuit of happiness. And being with my boyfriend fills me with so much happiness I cannot imagine going out with a woman at all right now.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain level of freedom and peace that comes with this self exploration and understanding that oft goes understated.

No probably not. But it will hurt her a lot now too and it would be absolutely nuclear for your brother. Chose the option that creates the less harm for everyone involved.

Don't make him lose EVERYBODY.", "YWBTA if you did this. \n\nIt isn't on you to decide who/how your brother loves. Be supportive. But he asked you to keep it between you two. Best to respect that. His feelings may come out eventually (or it may not...), but they're not yours to reveal. Especially since we know that feelings and attractions change over time.\n\nWe can acknowledge that it's a precarious situation regardless. Best move would be to have an honest conversation with him when he's not drunk. Because the effects of alcohol cause our brains to say weird things.

He cares about you, but it might be worth you and him having a conversation to clear up any possible doubts.\"", "What if someone ends up MURDERING his brother over it ? Was it still the \"only clear moral option\"? \n\nIt's a shitty situation but OP does not need that guilt!", "The brother getting murdered is also a possibility, hate crimes against LGBTQ people are on the rise and OP does not need that guilt if the worst happens. \n\nDo Not Out Him!", "Keep in mind, he thinks he \"may be\" gay.  I definitely think it should be the brother to talk to Jane and call off the wedding.  If the brother is not ready, maybe just say to Jane that the brother is having seconded thoughts and may go forward just out of community pressure, and they need to talk, but don't out him without his consent and particularly when he is still questioning.  He may be bi, or ace, or demi.  He would be marked in the community in a way that could never be repaired.  \n\nOP was asking about OUTING his brother.  That is a definite AH move.  Advising the fiance that his brother isn't ready without bringing sexuality into it is the only NTA compromise, and then only if the brother can't do it himself.", "Depending of the country, family and many other things, outing someone can be very dangerous. She could just tell him she knows and will be a support if he needs one to come clean. \n\nDeciding for someone else is a shitty decision.", "Agree to disagree. This is between the brother and his fiance. Outing people before they're ready can have long lasting psychological damage, including higher suicide rates. \n\nThe brother is TA if he doesn't come clean with his fiance, or at least break off the engagement for whatever reason if he's not ready to come out", "Obviously if John were in danger of being murdered, then he shouldn\u2019t be outed, but the wedding needs to be called off. Period. If John won\u2019t do it, then OP needs to do something. \n\nDo YOU think it\u2019s ok for the brother to use someone like that? To lie to someone about loving them? To have someone waste years of their life living a lie? If he decides to come out and end the marriage, then Jane is the one who has to pick of the pieces of her shattered life while John gets to go out and live the life he should have been living all along. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to tell Jane he\u2019s gay- he has options. He can give a different reason for calling off the wedding. He can move. He can remain a bachelor. \n\nI have deep sympathy for people who are in John\u2019s position. My sympathy ends when they decide to USE someone to cover for them because it will make their lives easier. John is making that decision and it is a despicable one. \n\nI love my siblings and we are close. If money were an issue, I\u2019d get a second job. If support was what they needed, I\u2019d be by their side. If they needed a place to live, they\u2019d always be welcome at mine. If they wanted me by their side when standing up to family, I\u2019d be there. What I won\u2019t do is stand silent and watch while they actively use someone and potentially waste years of that person\u2019s life. \n\nJohn deserves to live the life he wants. Jane does too.", "It's not OP's job. It's a horrible situation, I agree. But OP is not her sister, and last time I've checked, OP isn't Batman either, so she doesn't have to quell every injustice from this world. At the very most, OP could speak to her brother about this whole incident.", ">It\u2019s not his place to say anything to anyone.\n\nSure it is. They have a clear moral duty to not let a woman be lied to and tricked into a marriage.", "I do agree that he needs to call ofd the wedding but the most OP can do is have a conversation with his brother about it. NOT out him!", "I think living a lie is less bad than being murdered. But there's so much about this situation we don't know. Would Jane tell anyone else? Could John make up a different reason for not marrying her? Are Jane's relatives murderers? There's a huge difference between \"hates gay people\" and \"*murders* gay people\".", "You already asked that. Shame! If he gets killed because he tried to deceive a girl into marriage, that's not on OP. That's on him.", "Yes, he isn\u2019t sure he is gay by the sounds of it (I mean. He may be, and the \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2019 may have been a way to minimize/distance himself)\n\nThat\u2019s really all the OP would have to say to Jane. Just that he has some serious doubts/questions and that they REALLY need to have serious discussions.\n\nThe way I read OPs post, was that it seemed like outing his brother would be the only result of talking to Jane. Not that THATS his intention, but the only foreseeable outcome. Either he talks to Jane and she figures it out, or John talks to her and it comes out that way. There is a way for OP not to be the one who actually says it, but the result of his brother being outed in some way, before he\u2019s ready, seems pretty likely", "John is deciding for his fianc\u00e9, by taking her choice away through deception.\n\nJohn should not be allowed to do this evil act of tricking a poor soul into marriage.  If he's literally refusing not to trick someone into marriage, he's an asshole, and OP should just threaten to out him. If he still refuses, well, he's made his decision.", "I think it's a very complicated situation, but yes I do believe that if John won't call off the wedding OP should shut his mouth and let thing play out! \n\nI don't think staying in the closet and marrying the opposite sex is worst then putting someone's life at risk by outing them. Especially, when he doesn't seem sure himself.\n\nHate crimes against LGBTQ people are in the rise, getting murdered is a very real risk of getting outed! Especially, in a conservative community!", "You don't actually seem to give a shit about this woman at all tbh. Also at no point did I suggest op should resolve every injustice in the world, but they do know about this situation and unlike you seems to have empathy for people they aren't related to.\n\nOp needs to speak to her brother before going forward and hopefully help him see that a miserable sham marriage isn't his only option in life.", "So you think OP needs the guilt of knowing he was the one who outed his brother if one of Jane's relatives murders him to try and avenge her?", "No. Jane should not be a beard for John. She never should and I never said that she should.  It\u2019s Johns job to figure out what he wants before the marriage. Period.  OP doesn\u2019t have the right to run and tell Johns private business.", "Outing someone in a conservative community puts their life at risk. What if Jane has an ultra conservative gun nut as a relative and he decides to avenge her? \n\nHow would OP feel knowing he is the reasons the crazy relative knew his brother was gay? \n\nHate crimes against LGBTQ+ people are on the rise! \n\nDo not out him!", "So you do believe it's worst to stay in the closet and get married to the opposite sex then it is to murder someone for being gay! \n\nSHAME ON YOU!!!!!", "Seriously? FFS, we are not just talking about John\u2019s life here. Jane\u2019s life and happiness is at stake too! Why does Jane not deserve love the same way John deserves love? It seems like you\u2019re just looking at things from John\u2019s point of view. Jane is a person too and does not deserve to live a lie just because she\u2019s straight and life isn\u2019t as hard! Her reason for being is not to provide cover for John! How do you not get that? \n\nI cannot fathom anyone murdering John if he calls off the wedding. He does not have to come out; there are plenty of excuses he could give. \n\nAnd figuring himself out comes before the frickin\u2019 wedding, not after.\n\nBeing LGBTQ+ does NOT give someone the right to use people to make their life easier!", "I agree with your suggestion, she should speak to him and help him make the right choice. But she shouldn't out him and ruin his life for having tried his best at being straight in a society that promotes heterosexuality and blames homosexuals for all the sins of Israel.", "I don't think he should have any guilt. John brought this situation about by trying to trick and lie to a girl.\n\nI'm all for coping mechanisms, but this isn't one. This is another person's life he's threatening to fuck up.", "Yea I agree with you. But my original question was, what if John DOESN'T figure it out? What if he never talks to Jane about his concerns? THEN, what do you think should be done?", "The alternative to telling Jane is to not tell her and let her get exploited. You can't be in a relationship with someone, promise them forever and then years down the line be like whoops I was gay all along, sorry for stringing you along while I was figuring myself out. You shouldn't even be with someone if you're not attracted to them, as he already admitted.\n\nJohn needs to tell Jane. If she wants to blast the news to everyone else like she's a radio, then she'd be an AH too. But she has the right to make a decision about her own life with all the information in hand.\n\nIt's a shitty thing that lgbtq+ have hate crimes perpetrated against them but the reality is, John would be muuuch better off in an another place anyway and would need to leave this community. He wouldn't be able to live his life openly otherwise. This is all under the assumption that John actually is gay. He may be bi or straight or something else entirely. Until he figures it out though, no one else deserves to get dragged into the situation.", "They don\u2019t have to marry anyone.\n\nNo one says they have to come out but ruining another persons life is a spineless and cowardly thing to do.", "Shame on you!", "I do agree that the wedding should be called off. But outing his brother is not the way to go!\n\nHe needs to talk to him!", "Exactly! It\u2019s also incredibly selfish.", "No, shame on people who try trick others into marriage. If you do that, if you make it so the only option to save the innocent party is to out you, you deserve it.", "Shame on you for valuing the consequences of a man\u2019s own bad actions over a woman\u2019s right to make an informed decision.", "Shame on you!", "As someone who has been forcibly outed before, your behaviour is shameful."]}
