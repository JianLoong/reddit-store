I (23M) have an older brother who I'll call John (24M) who I've always been really close with. He is with his fianc\u00e9e Jane (24F) and they will be getting married very soon. Jane has always had a very good relationship with our family and the same is true for John with Jane's family. They were best friends as little kids, high-school sweethearts, and even went to college together. Needless to say, both sides of the family are all very exited for the wedding. I should also mention that the community I'm from is a conservative christian one. It's not like my family expects Jane to forgo her career in order to be a SAHM or something like that but things like marriage and having children are strongly encouraged.  \n\n\nLast weekend was John's bachelor party. It was nothing too crazy, just a nice steak dinner with some of his closest friends, myself included, and the night ended with everyone enjoying some drinks by a campfire. Eventually, after everyone had left, it was just me and John at the campfire. John seemed to be a lot more drunk than he usually gets. He started telling me that he was having second thoughts about the wedding. I told him that those feelings are normal but it was clear to me that he loved Jane very much and I'm sure they would have a great marriage. He then told me something that really shocked me. He said that although he feels a strong kinship with Jane, he has never been attracted to her. He said he thinks he is gay and only started dating Jane as a sort of coping mechanism to deny this fact to himself and to hide it from our community. Although I would always love my brother, I can't say how the rest of my family would react. He told me that I am the only person who knows and made me promise not to tell anyone. He said that he'll probably have to go ahead with the wedding and just carry his secret to the grave. I tried to talk this through with him some more but at that point, we was too drunk and inconsolable to listen to anything I was saying so I just took him home and helped him to bed.  \n\n\nI am strongly considering telling Jane what John told me because I care about her and don't want her to be in this situation. If I do tell her, it might make me the AH because John might be disowned by our judgemental community. I know Jane doesn't deserve to be in this situation but it's not John's fault he was and still is subjected to these heteronormative societal pressures.

But if this blows up (and if my experience with this type of communities is anything to go by \u2014 I\u2019m from one and also \ud83c\udf08) then your brother might well be fucked and excised.\n\nNo matter what you choose here you\u2019ll hurt someone and loose. You care for Jane and your Brother, and no matter what happens in this shitty situation life has thrown at your families someone (probably everyone) is gonna get hurt to some extent\n\nSo find a different choice. You can\u2019t really be the one to say shit about this, and I would argue it\u2019d be more AH to say a secret that isn\u2019t yours, than it would be to hide it. So don\u2019t set yourself the responsibility to say it, return that responsibility to its rightful owner: your brother.\n\nTalk to him first, don\u2019t give him the chance to evade or escape and make it clear to him you know what he told you, and assure him of how much you love him.

Then see if you can get him to open up and help him explore those emotions.\n\nI\u2019d suggest also finding a way to maybe see a therapist for a day or something, see a professional in the matters of the mind and live like this. If only for peace of mind. Maybe he realises he is and that hiding it is a bad idea, or maybe he realises otherwise. At least then you\u2019d give him the power to decide his own destiny. \n\nFinally, and take it from a \ud83c\udf08guy.

I never really had that much pressure to date women, always felt more comfortable bucking the trend in the pursuit of happiness. And being with my boyfriend fills me with so much happiness I cannot imagine going out with a woman at all right now.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain level of freedom and peace that comes with this self exploration and understanding that oft goes understated.

I get you I really do but outing your brother will do significant harm especially since he doesn't seem to have any type of network to fall back on. This harm will be greater than Jane having her heart broken.\n\nThere are so many more things you can try first:\nMore talks, suggest therapy, find your brother local queer support groups, talk with other queer people online and ask advice, help him build an escape plan/get him a safe place for when he's ostracised, etc etc. \n\nWill all of that happen before the marriage? No probably not. But it will hurt her a lot now too and it would be absolutely nuclear for your brother. Chose the option that creates the less harm for everyone involved. Your brother didn't chose this. \n\nAnd another thing: he now thinks he at least have one person he can trust. You. He will lose that as well if you out him. Don't make him lose EVERYBODY.", "YWBTA if you did this. \n\nIt isn't on you to decide who/how your brother loves. Be supportive. But he asked you to keep it between you two. Best to respect that. His feelings may come out eventually (or it may not...), but they're not yours to reveal. Especially since we know that feelings and attractions change over time.\n\nWe can acknowledge that it's a precarious situation regardless. Best move would be to have an honest conversation with him when he's not drunk. Because the effects of alcohol cause our brains to say weird things.

I don\u2019t understand all these comments about \u201cabsolutely not outing someone.\u201d It\u2019s between John and Jane, but it is outrageously unfair to Jane to let her walk unknowingly into a sham marriage. It should be John who tells her \u2014 causing perhaps pain in the short term but saving a whole lot of mess in the long term \u2014 but if he won\u2019t OP must.", "I mean, mood.", "That's not really fair to Jane.", "What about Jane\u2019s choice? Isn\u2019t not telling her taking her choice away? \n\nJohn REALLY needs to be the one to tell her. Yes, he is in a very difficult situation but he is the one who got involved with her, without being honest. With her and himself. She obviously thinks he is in love with her. But he is not the same way she is with him. Right there, he is being dishonest with her. Even if he wasn\u2019t questioning his sexuality.  He made a mistake in proposing when he wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about her. \n\nThere is a lot of worry about John and his rights. But his aren\u2019t the only ones that are in danger here.", "OP wrote that the family and community would probably exclude his brother over this. Even though he is doing exactly what these people want, which is staying in the closet. Either way the brother is screwed. It should be entirely his decision, not OP's", "The community he's in is all about enforcing their values on others. I don't think In the current political climate, that can't be in any doubt. Possibly not his group specifically,, but very much so generally. And they typically believe God hates gay people, and will enforce that.\n\nThe national dialog has basically been\n\n\"we hate (fill in group that doesn't think like they do)\"\n\n\"why not just mind your own business if it's not out you?\"\n\n(howling monkey sounds)\n\n\nThe advice goes against what their \"religious\" leaders  in all their psychosis and self-loathing  makes them believe - that it's \"God's will\" - to manipulate them into the atrocious behaviors we've all seen over and over - not just with regard to LGBTQ+, but also women, children, the elderly, the disabled, non Christians (and many other types of Christians), anybody with advanced education, etc.", "In any other circumstance, I\u2019d agree. But what about Jane? How is it fair or right by her? She is not going into the marriage with the person she thinks she is. By not telling her, her choice is being taken away. \n\nThe best thing would be for John to tell her. But she really needs to know so she can choose what to do.", "Wrong.\n\nYou can give him the chance to end the wedding himself but if he chooses not to then Op should tell the truth to Jane.\n\nHe has no right to manipulate and lie to someone and waste their life and time. Gay or Not.", "He gets to decide when he comes out sure, but he doesn't get to use that poor woman as a bloody human shield until he's ready. He needs to find another way to call it off if he's not ready to come out.", "It stopped being just his choice when he involved another person and is in effect, deceiving her. \n\nHow is it right to lie to a woman about who you are before marriage? Isn\u2019t that taking away her right to choose? She\u2019s not marrying the person she believes she is.\n\nIt is a horrible situation and I feel for everyone. But John isn\u2019t the only person to consider in this mess.", "Exactly.", "Still keep quiet.  It\u2019s not his place to say anything to anyone.  Not even as a joke.  Drunken ramblings or not.  The onus then becomes Johns to figure out for himself what to do.", "...\n\nWhat", "I agree, tough situation, but outing someone who thinks they \"may be\" gay is not the answer. Societies broad non-acceptance of someone who is not razor straight leads to too many suicides by people trying to navigate society. If he truly loves Jane, he really needs to express that and step back. Agree on that.", "That's true but I would still not out him. i think op has to talk to him and then tell him he needs to tell Jane (or instead of saying he is gay, that he loves her as a friend but not romantically) otherwise Op will tell her that he doesn't love her romantically. However, op should not out him but seek first the conversation with him", "How is he wasting her life if he's willing to play the part of dutiful husband? Look, I agree that relationships shouldn't be based on lies. But this has too many Iimplications to be anyone's decision other than the person involved.", "Yo, you think it's ok to let him take advantage of Jane and use her as a beard like that?? At the very least, she has a right to know John was never attracted to her. That's a terrible thing to do to someone!\n\nJohn better figure his shit out before the wedding and if he doesn't, Jane deserves to be told so she can dump his ass for someone who actually loves her.", "I come from a similar community and am \ud83c\udf08 \n\nSo I feel this: \u201cfucking religion man\u201d.", "Well he needs to talk to his brother again. There's no way he can marry Jane. That's simply unfair to her.", "That I agree with. The real problem I can see is if John refuses to do so.\n\nDefinitely has to be handled very carefully", "Because weirdly enough people want to marry someone who actually loves them and wants to be with them?", "Because he is marrying someone under false pretenses! How is that possibly ok?! \n\nShe believes he is in love with her the way she is with him. And he isn\u2019t. Even if he wasn\u2019t questioning his sexuality, he is being dishonest with how he feels about her.\n\nHe is in effect, deceiving her and in so doing, keeping her from being with someone else. Someone who would be able to reciprocate.\n\nThere is so much worry about John (and I get it) but the lack of worry for the woman\u2026 for HER right  to choose, is pretty alarming", "agree. tough situation. Not fair to the brother either. I would honestly be surprised if Jane doesn't know or doesn't suspect.", "And weirdly enough people want to have siblings who can be trusted with important information that would destroy one's life if it came out. \n\nLike I said, if it was safe, the brother would have come out long ago. Nobody wants to live a life pretending to be someone they're not, unless the alternative is a lot worse.", "It is not ok and I never said it was. But two wrongs don't make a right.", "That is a rather shallow and glib response to a rather serious and complicated situation. And has nothing to do with the issue really. \n\nJohn is the one who put both his brother and Jane in an awful position. Yes, it\u2019s tragic that he is in a situation where he feels forced to hide himself. But that does not give him the right to use others.\n\nJohn needs to take accountability and responsibility. \n\nOP needs to talk to him again and convince him to talk to Jane. And if he doesn\u2019t, then OP needs to talk to her. It\u2019s possible to do this without outing John, but really, it\u2019s his mess. John is the one who got everyone involved in this debacle and it\u2019s his responsibility to fix it."]}
