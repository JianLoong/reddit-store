I (23M) have an older brother who I'll call John (24M) who I've always been really close with. He is with his fianc\u00e9e Jane (24F) and they will be getting married very soon. Jane has always had a very good relationship with our family and the same is true for John with Jane's family. They were best friends as little kids, high-school sweethearts, and even went to college together. Needless to say, both sides of the family are all very exited for the wedding. I should also mention that the community I'm from is a conservative christian one. It's not like my family expects Jane to forgo her career in order to be a SAHM or something like that but things like marriage and having children are strongly encouraged.  \n\n\nLast weekend was John's bachelor party. It was nothing too crazy, just a nice steak dinner with some of his closest friends, myself included, and the night ended with everyone enjoying some drinks by a campfire. Eventually, after everyone had left, it was just me and John at the campfire. John seemed to be a lot more drunk than he usually gets. He started telling me that he was having second thoughts about the wedding. I told him that those feelings are normal but it was clear to me that he loved Jane very much and I'm sure they would have a great marriage. He then told me something that really shocked me. He said that although he feels a strong kinship with Jane, he has never been attracted to her. He said he thinks he is gay and only started dating Jane as a sort of coping mechanism to deny this fact to himself and to hide it from our community. Although I would always love my brother, I can't say how the rest of my family would react. He told me that I am the only person who knows and made me promise not to tell anyone. He said that he'll probably have to go ahead with the wedding and just carry his secret to the grave. I tried to talk this through with him some more but at that point, we was too drunk and inconsolable to listen to anything I was saying so I just took him home and helped him to bed.  \n\n\nI am strongly considering telling Jane what John told me because I care about her and don't want her to be in this situation. If I do tell her, it might make me the AH because John might be disowned by our judgemental community. I know Jane doesn't deserve to be in this situation but it's not John's fault he was and still is subjected to these heteronormative societal pressures.

But if this blows up (and if my experience with this type of communities is anything to go by \u2014 I\u2019m from one and also \ud83c\udf08) then your brother might well be fucked and excised.\n\nNo matter what you choose here you\u2019ll hurt someone and loose. You care for Jane and your Brother, and no matter what happens in this shitty situation life has thrown at your families someone (probably everyone) is gonna get hurt to some extent\n\nSo find a different choice. You can\u2019t really be the one to say shit about this, and I would argue it\u2019d be more AH to say a secret that isn\u2019t yours, than it would be to hide it.

Then see if you can get him to open up and help him explore those emotions.\n\nI\u2019d suggest also finding a way to maybe see a therapist for a day or something, see a professional in the matters of the mind and live like this. If only for peace of mind. Maybe he realises he is and that hiding it is a bad idea, or maybe he realises otherwise. At least then you\u2019d give him the power to decide his own destiny. \n\nFinally, and take it from a \ud83c\udf08guy.

I never really had that much pressure to date women, always felt more comfortable bucking the trend in the pursuit of happiness. And being with my boyfriend fills me with so much happiness I cannot imagine going out with a woman at all right now.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain level of freedom and peace that comes with this self exploration and understanding that oft goes understated.

No probably not. But it will hurt her a lot now too and it would be absolutely nuclear for your brother. Chose the option that creates the less harm for everyone involved.

Don't make him lose EVERYBODY.", "YWBTA if you did this. \n\nIt isn't on you to decide who/how your brother loves. Be supportive. But he asked you to keep it between you two. Best to respect that. His feelings may come out eventually (or it may not...), but they're not yours to reveal. Especially since we know that feelings and attractions change over time.\n\nWe can acknowledge that it's a precarious situation regardless. Best move would be to have an honest conversation with him when he's not drunk. Because the effects of alcohol cause our brains to say weird things.

He cares about you, but it might be worth you and him having a conversation to clear up any possible doubts.\"", "What if someone ends up MURDERING his brother over it ? Was it still the \"only clear moral option\"? \n\nIt's a shitty situation but OP does not need that guilt!", "The brother getting murdered is also a possibility, hate crimes against LGBTQ people are on the rise and OP does not need that guilt if the worst happens. \n\nDo Not Out Him!", "Keep in mind, he thinks he \"may be\" gay.  I definitely think it should be the brother to talk to Jane and call off the wedding.  If the brother is not ready, maybe just say to Jane that the brother is having seconded thoughts and may go forward just out of community pressure, and they need to talk, but don't out him without his consent and particularly when he is still questioning.  He may be bi, or ace, or demi.  He would be marked in the community in a way that could never be repaired.  \n\nOP was asking about OUTING his brother.  That is a definite AH move.  Advising the fiance that his brother isn't ready without bringing sexuality into it is the only NTA compromise, and then only if the brother can't do it himself.", "Depending of the country, family and many other things, outing someone can be very dangerous. She could just tell him she knows and will be a support if he needs one to come clean. \n\nDeciding for someone else is a shitty decision.", "Agree to disagree. This is between the brother and his fiance. Outing people before they're ready can have long lasting psychological damage, including higher suicide rates. \n\nThe brother is TA if he doesn't come clean with his fiance, or at least break off the engagement for whatever reason if he's not ready to come out", "Obviously if John were in danger of being murdered, then he shouldn\u2019t be outed, but the wedding needs to be called off.

To have someone waste years of their life living a lie? If he decides to come out and end the marriage then Jane is the one who has to pick of the pieces of her shattered life while John gets to go out and live the life he should have been living all along. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to tell Jane he\u2019s gay- he has options. He can give a different reason for calling off the wedding. He can move. He can remain a bachelor. \n\nI have deep sympathy for people who are in John\u2019s position. My sympathy ends when they decide to USE someone to cover for them because it will make their lives easier. John is making that decision and it is a despicable one. \n\nI love my siblings and we are close. If money were an issue, I\u2019d get a second job. If support was what they needed, I\u2019d be by their side. If they needed a place to live, they\u2019d always be welcome at mine. If they wanted me by their side when standing up to family, I\u2019d be there. What I won\u2019t do is stand silent and watch while they actively use someone and potentially waste years of that person\u2019s life. \n\nJohn deserves to live the life he wants. Jane does too.", "It's not OP's job. It's a horrible situation, I agree. But OP is not her sister, and last time I've checked, OP isn't Batman either, so she doesn't have to quell every injustice from this world.

Just that he has some serious doubts/questions and that they REALLY need to have serious discussions.\n\nThe way I read OPs post, was that it seemed like outing his brother would be the only result of talking to Jane. Not that THATS his intention, but the only foreseeable outcome. Either he talks to Jane and she figures it out, or John talks to her and it comes out that way. There is a way for OP not to be the one who actually says it, but the result of his brother being outed in some way, before he\u2019s ready, seems pretty likely", "John is deciding for his fianc\u00e9, by taking her choice away through deception.\n\nJohn should not be allowed to do this evil act of tricking a poor soul into marriage.

Her reason for being is not to provide cover for John! How do you not get that? \n\nI cannot fathom anyone murdering John if he calls off the wedding.

John brought this situation about by trying to trick and lie to a girl.\n\nI'm all for coping mechanisms, but this isn't one. This is another person's life he's threatening to fuck up.", "Yea I agree with you. But my original question was, what if John DOESN'T figure it out? What if he never talks to Jane about his concerns? THEN, what do you think should be done?", "The alternative to telling Jane is to not tell her and let her get exploited. You can't be in a relationship with someone, promise them forever and then years down the line be like whoops I was gay all along, sorry for stringing you along while I was figuring myself out. You shouldn't even be with someone if you're not attracted to them, as he already admitted.\n\nJohn needs to tell Jane.

I second other commenters who suggest another serious conversation with your brother in broad daylight now that you're both sober.  Specifically tell him that he has to confess to Jane, and that if he doesn't, you will.  Give him a few days to figure out how to tell her, and then back up your words.  I hope Jane doesn't choose to out him to the rest of the family, but that's really on her.", "Yes, YWBTA if you outted your brother. This is a lose-lose situation so the best you can hope for is the best outcome. The worst that could happen if you don't out him is he comes out later on during his marriage and upsets Jane. You out him now and he could be killed. All because he trusted you not to say anything. Both aren't ideal but no reasonable person would think that your brother possibly being killed is better than hurting some feelings/getting a divorce. \n\nIt isn't your place, nor your responsibility to put someone. The best action you can take is talk to your brother and explain that you support him and even if doesn't feel safe to come out, perhaps he could call off the wedding and stay single until he can move to somewhere he feels safe to exist as himself.

I empathize with the situation his brother is in, as I have main friends who have come out as gay as adults.\n\nBut I also dated a gay guy. I didn't know he was gay. He did not come out for almost a decade after we broke up. During the relationship, his lack of intimacy really messed with me. I thought it was my fault, I was not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough, talented enough. So I pushed myself to excel, and it came at the expense of my mental and physical health. Now to be fair, I had a very abusive school experience a few years before he and I started dating, but his behavior really made it worse. Why didn't he kiss me? Why didn't he bring me around to meet his parents? Why did he hide the gifts I gave him?\n\nIn short, HIS deception really did a number on me. Depression turned to really dark thoughts. I started starving myself to be pretty enough for him. My mental health spiraled. Now imagine someone going all the way through to MARRYING someone he does not love or have attraction to. There is no way this does not end badly for his fiance and future wife. By not being honest with her, at BEST he is robbing her of the chance to find someone who WILL truly love her, at WORST he is causing insecurities in her that could have lasting emotional and maybe physical damage and side effects.\n\nBrother needs to be honest, or at least partway honest. Tell her that he does not love her and can't marry her. But if he continues to go through with this, I think OP is obligated to let Jane know that he is not attracted to her and does not want to marry her.", "This is a lovely comment with detailed advice of what OP can do, and I hope all turns out as hopefully as this comment mentions. \n\nBUT. *But*, all this lies upon the premise that OP's brother decides to face and ultimately come to terms with his own sexuality, and take the healthy route of therapy and not marrying Jane as a cover in a deeply repressive religious community and family environment like OP's. There is however still a chance that he might try to avoid the immediately difficult and hard work route, live in denial and marry Jane as a cover. The shame and fear of queer folks in communities like these run deep. It's sad. Take it from another queer person raised in a deeply religious Asian country. \n\nHowever, as a person who's also afab- I would argue that if push comes to shove, OP can (and *should*) lay it straight in front of his brother- either brother breaks off this engagement or OP will be *forced* to out brother to Jane. Because if he ends up marrying Jane as a cover, Jane will face not just a \"loveless marriage\" but a potential violation of her very consent. Jane has never consented to marry, engage in sexual relations with and get pregnant for a gay person who is simply using her as a cover. Do y'all not see how dehumanizing that is? Jane deserves to have her agency and a say in making informed consent and decisions in her major life events. I hope it does not come to OP essentially threatening to out his brother/actually outing his brother. But if it does, and OP does inform Jane- then it's NTA in my opinion.\n\nBut again, OP, please exhaust all options before it comes to threatening to out/outing your brother. Hopefully it all works out for all three of you and that this difficult period in y'all's life is short.", "ESH besides Jane", "Over one drunken conversation? No.", "Agreed. OP should tell his brother that he loves him and accepts him the way he is, absolutely, and he should encourage him to cancel the wedding - he doesn't have to come out to Jane, but he has to let Jane go. If he won't, OP should tell Jane - at least the part that John said he doesn't love her like a husband should.", "We don't even know if it will end up being a sham marriage if it goes through, nor does OP. It's often obvious to outside parties that a soon to be marriage should not go through. It's okay to have a heart to heart with the party you are close with, but it should not interfere by going to the other party with a \"drunken feeling\".", "you need to wake up and realise that abandonment is not the only thing gay people face in extremely conservative and religious communities. they can be killed or even raped in the name of conversion therapy for fck's sake! is a loveless marriage that bad? if jane doesn't feel the love from john, why would she be marrying him anyway? and there's no need of hurting either of them in the long term. op could simply just come up with an excuse as to why jane shouldn't be marrying john and there needs to be no mention of him being gay.", "Between OP & his brother, OP should make it abundantly clear that he knows he was being genuine. I would lead with that in fact to head off any denial. Something like:\n\n\"I know you might say you don't remember our conversation or that there's no truth to it because of how drunk you were, but I want you to know that I do not judge you at all and I love you just the same. If you need to deny it to me right now, that's fine but know that I won't believe your denials. The pain and fear I saw in you was real, and we both know that. Knowing that you trust me enough to be that vulnerable with me, drunk or not, means a lot to me and I don't want to break that trust. We need to talk about it because I don't want you to make a mistake that will hurt you and others in the long run, not because I think any less of you. I will keep your secret, but I can't let you make a huge mistake. I want to help you find a way out of this that keeps you safe and maintains your privacy until you're ready, but also keeps you from making a promise you know you can't truly fulfill the way both of you deserve in a marriage.\"\n\nIf he denies it, I would just keep saying I don't believe him, reassuring him that it's okay, and hopefully he will stop trying to fight it when he sees that's not an option anymore. If worse comes to worse and he refuses to acknowledge it, talk it through, and make a plan, I'd give him an ultimatum and tell him I won't tell anyone the cause but morally I have to intervene and urge her not to go through with the wedding. I'd let him know that moving forward is far, far worse to me than being gay and remind him that I would be just as morally obligated to tell him if she had said something similar to me. I'd tell him I think she deserves to know the full truth, but if he's not ready for that she at least needs to know that she's entering a marriage with someone who will not be able to love her the way she deserves.", "Tell Jane his brother confessed to not loving her and also cheating on her or something. There are plenty of \u201cheterosexual\u201d reasons not to go through with a wedding. It\u2019s a white lie that protects his brother and prevents Jane from ended up in a nightmare marriage.

John could also be straight and confessing that he wasn't attracted to Jane and didn't love as he should. So the brother doesn't need to out John.

I would rather you feel the brief hurt now than for us to endure years of hurting and resenting each other\".   Then if your brother could afford it, he should move away for awhile and maybe if you could afford it, sponsor his move financially because the family on both sides will be like a pack on wolves at his heel over the break-up and thinking like you, that it's just pre-wedding nerves and not knowing his true feelings.", "Ywbta if you didn\u2019t tell her.  \n\nYears of her life shouldn\u2019t be wasted to help your brother hide from his family\u2019s judgement.

It would literally be safer for John for OP to lie that John cheated on Jane or something like that, instead of outing him. \n\nIt\u2019s a bad situation overall, but potentially putting his brother\u2019s life at risk by outing him should be the last resort here when there are other ways to prevent the marriage.", "I am very aware that we are people thank you very much!", "OP should talk with his brother but if his brother doesn't call off the wedding and explain why to Jane, OP should tell her.", ">he isn\u2019t sure he is gay\n\nDoesn't matter in the end if he is or not, because he is sure of this:\n\n>he has never been attracted to her.\n\nDating Jane for years, lying to her massively for all that time about his feelings, makes him an AH.", "That doesn't sound like the same situation at all, because you are bi and not gay and seemingly were actually attracted and still are to your partner.", ">Apparently you've already made that judgement call - and a loveless marriage is worse than assault, r4pe, or murd3r? Burdening their brother with that risk is not OPs place.\n\nYou're clearly biased. While there is the possibility of physical harm towards the brother, to boil it down to a loveless marriage is disingenuous, gross and discredits the harm it could do to Jane. Like have you not seen the absolute mental carnage that partners are left with when their closeted partner suddenly comes out and wants a divorce?\n\nThe feelings of self loathing? Of feeling used and discarded when convenient? The depression? The anxiety? Never feeling totally loved? Betrayal by someone who was supposed to love you? Low self-esteem? Constant self doubt? The trust issues? Wasting years loving someone who couldn't properly reciprocate? The list goes on. There is a whole lot of trauma that comes from being used as a cover for someone's sexuality. But of course that's okay because Jane won't be physically harmed. \ud83d\ude12", "This is another example of selfishness. If we call politicians selfish for thinking about themselves and not the masses. This is also an example of selfishness. Why does OP's brother need to involve an innocent person in something she does not need to be involved in? \n\nOP absolutely should not out his brother but do you really not care for decades in someone's life? Things that can very obviously be prevented do not need to happen. OP's brother just needs to call off the wedding.\n\nThe way you so easily see Jane as something so dispensable is worrying.", ">a loveless marriage is worse than assault, r4pe, or murder\n\nSo if someone told you they loved you and they were attracted to you and you consented to have sex with them UNDER THOSE PRETENSES only to find out that they were literally using you the whole time, that's neither assault nor rape, yeah?\n\n(that's a rhetorical question, that's rape!!! (: )\n\nYou're arguing against something that no one said. I don't see any comment in this thread here advocating for OP's brother to be outed, we're just saying that Sarah should be told he doesn't love her and never has. There's no need to bring his sexuality into it, and again, no one is advocating for an outing, so maybe argue with what we're actually saying instead of lighting a strawman on fire in the hopes we won't see that your thought process is misogynistic as fuck.", "With my husband, yes. We are still very happily together. He's literally the only person that let me explore that side of myself with absolute support & no judgement. He saved me. He & I recently realized we have helped each other heal from our trama. He's the light I needed. I was the darkness he needed. It's been really cool to be a part of of life experience. We both deconverted from religion together so I think that has helped us understand each other.", "I swear I've read some AITA posts from women who have had this happen to them and they are bleak.", "Also he's opposing a 'loveless marriage' and rape, but huuuh consenting to having sex with your loving partner only to find out they never loved you is not consent. \n\nSo he's opposing a woman being (almost 100% for sure if they do get married) raped and a man being (potentially) raped, and straight up telling us one of those is acceptable.", ">It feels like sexism to me.\n\nYeah, because it is. Her life and happiness is also important and actually John has been an AH to her for years. She could have dated for a long time a boy/man who actually loves her back, for truly adores her and not someone who just uses her as a cover.\n\n**She is by far the biggest victim in this situation.**\n\nNot John like so many are saying here. He could have just not dated anyone. He could have used for example the excuse of not having met the right woman yet or could have simply said that he likes being single and is not interested in marriage. He could have also moved away from the nasty community he lives in. John had choices which didn't involve outing himself and which especially didn't involve massively lying to a young teenage girl and later young woman. Letting it even go so far that he didn't stop the relationship before it came to the betrothal, makes him an AH here.", "Bro decided to use a woman. He needs to face the consequences to that. He could have chosen a lesbian woman who needed a beard for the same reason."]}
