Also, how old are you?", "NTA \n\nOf course you should be doing chores but if her reason for piling chores onto you is that she doesn't want to see you relaxing and doing nothing then that's ridiculous, you're entitled to enjoy your free time. And even if she were your parent or you lived with her full time, threatening to send you to bed at 5pm is hilarious. Your parents agree with you so there's nothing to worry about, just be respectful about it. Some people think kids should always be active and doing something, I'd say you're allowed to relax a bit after finals, nothing wrong with that", "NTA\n\nshe is hosting your family, it is not your responsibility to do chores around her house. \n\nThe only disrespect is from her! You are her guest!", "> She got angry and said I was disrespectful. AITA?\n\nNo, you're NTA.

The amount of negative votes I\u2019ve seen whose only argument is \u201cyou\u2019re a kid and you said no to an adult, therefore you are a brat\u201d is astounding. Like, no matter how unreasonable it is to demand hard physical labour from a 15 year old with no previous experience on the matter, OP is in the wrong because they dared to say no. There isn\u2019t even an actual need for them to do this labour, their parents are paying actual workers for it. These kids just can\u2019t win, it seems. NTA.", "You need to be more specific and offer more details. What kind of chores? You also sound really nasty, \u201cyou can\u2019t make me\u201d sounds threatening and ominous.", "You're 15. They're early 50s. How old are your parents? They must have had you young!", "NTA. Not even a little. You're her guest and I saw from your comments that your parents not only pay people to do those chores but they pay for her freaking house, too!?\n\nIf I had family doing that much for me, I'd be treating them *and* their kid like royalty. Instead she bullies you for the hell of it. You had every right to tell her off.\n\nI had to deal with family members acting like that when I was your age. It's total bullshit.

Parenting is hard and stressful, so just try to understand where she\u2019s coming from too (put yourself in her perspective)", "I'm gonna go with a tentative NTA. If you're 15 and just got done with finals (presuming you did well) then school is your job and right now you're on a well earned vacation. You don't need to be working the fields just because school isn't in session this very second.\n\nThat said, this is a close one. If even minor details aren't exactly as you've portrayed them (which I do encourage you to investigate your own perspective on the matter), then the scenario flips and you're being a massive asshole. It sounds like there is work to be done, you are able to do it (with guidance, of course), and you're not really doing anything else right now. It seems like it could be a reasonable request that you help out with family business.\n\nI would encourage you to talk with your parents or other family members to get their opinion and see if they can be an intermediary for you. Otherwise, this will likely be a sore spot going forward.", "YTA you *are* being disrespectful. The world doesn't stop turning because you just had finals.

You ought to be helping out in some way, if not tending the animals, there must be something you can help do.  I\u2019m not saying (and doubt you grandmother meant) all day, full time work. The way you spoke to her is embarrassingly disrespectful. \n\nIt is not unusual for people to have house rules. Other than requesting you do some chores, I didn\u2019t see you list anything else. \n\nGrandmother sucks too in that she could have asked nicely for help instead of barking out a command or demanding.  Although she was probably disgusted with the lump of \u2018serve me\u2019 lounging on her couch. \n\nWhere are your parents??!

Your grandmother is probably worried about your ability to continue the family line.", "NTA\n\nI think she needs to cut you some slack. When I used to be done with my exams and wanted to laze around, I\u2019d be given stuff to do, too. It\u2019s be so annoying because they didn\u2019t give me work because it was important and needed to be done but because they just couldn\u2019t leave me alone. \n\nJust explain it to her very clearly that you finished your exams and want to relax some", "NTA", "NTA - but also very disrespectful and poor work ethic.  Finals are over, how does that affect you ability to do anything right now?  A day or so to \u201crelax\u201d is all anyone needs.", "YTA. Her house, her rules, and they are that everyone helps. Are you sleeping in a bed with clean linens? Using a clean bathroom, eating food who bought, who prepared, who cleans up?  Ask your family to do your share if they think you need a break, but your best option is to leave as soon as possible and go somewhere the rules are a better fit.", "ESH. While I fully agree with you that she does not have the authority to tell you what to do, I think that you are being disrespectful and rude to your grandmother through all of this. I get that she doesn\u2019t pay for the house or have the final say over you, but she deserves more respect than she\u2019s getting here. She is your grandmother, and you are her blood. She wishes nothing but the best for you, and she biologically loves you more than you will ever know. Sometimes in life, you have to bite your tongue and do things that you don\u2019t want to in some capacity. However, not doing this will result in your severing your bond with your grandmother, which could permanently damage your relationship in the long-run. Another side note is that you also don\u2019t see the situation from her perspective. You detailed that you\u2019ve been working hard on your school work, which I commend you for, but unfortunately, she just sees the part where you\u2019re doing nothing all day. She feels that it is her responsibility as your grandmother to guide you and ensure that you turn out successful. I\u2019m sure she was also raised differently. She wasn\u2019t raised in a generation where you can watch Netflix all day or lounge on TikTok for hours scrolling. It makes sense that you get a break, but for her, she just wants to help. Show her some respect, and bite your tongue a bit if you have to. I\u2019m not looking for you to comment back and argue with me, but I am rather looking to seriously get through to you before you damage your relationship here.", "YTA and very disrespectful.", "Yta. You're in her home. You're not an infant. Time to grow up.", "Also, you don\u2019t really wanna know if you\u2019re the asshole. You\u2019re arguing with everyone\u2019s responses. If someone tells you you\u2019re an asshole you just start arguing with them like a brat.", "YTA.  I have to be honest.  I'd do anything my Nana would have requested.

She can *make* you leave you know.", "you are being disrespectful to your grandma.\n\nbut my questions are\n\ndid she \"ASK\" you to do chores or \"TELL\" you to do them?\n\nIt wouldn't hurt to do a few chores to keep yourself active and mindful to duties you will need to learn in your adult life. \n\nIt doesn't matter who the house belongs to, it's still a home to your grandmother.", "ESH.  \n\nYou for being rude to grandmother. You're right she can't make you do anything but you have an attitude.  You should have your parents tell her you're taking a break. And your parents are AHs for not intervening.  \n\nYour grandmother is an AH for not going to your parents. \n\nEnjoy your break but don't forget you have to live with her until you go home.  She may not be able to make you do anything but she can your stay unpleasant if you keep provoking her.", "ESH. While she does NOT have the \"authority\" to tell you what to do, you acted disrespectful and rude here, too. Sometimes, you have to bite your tongue and suck it up. You didn't have to argue back and forth with her on the spot, as things like that are what will end up tearing apart your relationship in the future. You could just be polite or maybe even help out a little bit to make her feel heard, because at the end of the day, she is your grandmother, and she is only looking out for you. She doesn't see that you were studying and working hard to pass your tests, she just sees you lounging around all day now. She feels responsible to step in and lead you in the right direction solely based off of what she is seeing now. I get it - you probably work hard, and you're likely not as lazy as she is making it seem like. However, you need to understand that she is your grandma, and she deserves respect. You both love each other, and I'm sure you'd enjoy your break more without the tension and arguments that come along with challenging her. Be kinder to her, and life will be kinder to you when you are in her position as a grandmother yourself one day.", "You should do what your told or get out of her house.\n\nYou are a disrespectful child.", "YTA.

Guess they can stop cooking, shopping and cleaning for you since you can't make them do that and then you can buy your own food, with your own money, and then find some way to cook it since she does not have to let you use her kitchen and her equipment.\n\nHope you enjoy sleeping on an airbed on the floor with out any sheets etc because she does not have to give you a proper bed nor sheets as you are a guest at her house.  \n\nYou are being a brat.", "Based on the information you provided, YTA.\n\nWhat you call \"making me do chores\", other people would call  asking you for help.  When you are a guest in someone else's home and the host asks you for help, then you help.  Especially if the host is an older woman.  Unless your legs are broken or something.\n\nI agree the sending to bed thing is weird. but unless I'm missing something, you're not being a good guest.

Talk to your Nan about it. \n\nAnd a small word advice young man, there is a time and place for being cheeky to your parents/grandparents and being asked to participate in chores of the household (even if it\u2019s a farm) ISNT one of them - this sort of stuff is exactly the kind of thing they will take into consideration should you ask for their help later on down the track (like with a car purchase, college,moving house). \nApologise to Nan and chew your humble sandwich while you read the manual to that tractor.", "Do you really think this is about legal authority?", "Very well congrats definitely be proud of that.", "Because the farmland is around the house?", "Ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter whether she had a plan for me to learn it safely, because I don\u2019t *want to* and have no obligation to. \n\nAs for regretting it later, my parents are the ones funding her lifestyle and they agree with me.", "While some aspects of OP's story seem a little off to me, mainly details that make me question if this is real, I'm choosing to believe it is, and based on the details given, while I agree OP was a little disrespectful, that doesn't make them an AH. The grandmother is an adult and I cannot believe she wasn't told about OP's achievements in school. If I wanted to get a teenager to do some chores, especially apparent farmwork that they have no experience with, I'd frame it in the way of wanting to spend time with them and teach them something. To just bark orders like that makes the grandma the AH. Why was that her first instinct for how to talk to her grandchild?", "I think it is in the eyes of people who are saying \u2018her house, her rules\u2019.", "Thank you!", "That's not what people usually mean", "How does owning a property that they dont live in give them the right to dictate what the person living there does?", "I disagree", "And? It doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m giving that energy, it\u2019s factually true: I\u2019ve skipped multiple grades, gotten a 4.6 GPA with 8 APs, and have been admitted to an Ivy.", "And?", "You are acting like a child and have the nerves to call someone else 12 years old? Pathetic", "Because they\u2019re the legal owners", "You HAVE to be trolling. I don't believe for a second that if you finished all your standard chores and then were given more chores for no real reason, especially to go do manual labor or anything else you didn't have experience with you'd just say okay and hop to it. I'm sure you're going to say you would because you respect your elders, but a) I still won't believe it, and b) you need to give respect to get respect. Never once have I respected an elder for just randomly barking at me to do something. If I get yelled at because I was told to do something reasonable and didn't, that's a different story. I'd deserve that. But I would not just go along with it if someone started acting like their grandmother. Especially since it seems the chores she wanted them to do weren't reasonable.", "That\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to agree."]}
