{"id": 16592, "submission_id": "13acua7", "title": "WIBTA If I Missed My Stepdaughter's Graduation Party?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (49m) have a stepdaughter, \"Lucy\" (18f), through my wife \"Mary\" (53f). I came into Lucy's life when she was 6 and married Mary when she was 8. Her father \"Joe\" (53m) has been in and out of Lucy's life since her parents broken up and whenever Joe disappointed her Mary and I were there to pick up the pieces. I honestly don't like the guy but I hold my tongue since Lucy loves her dad in spite of everything.\n\nGrowing up I was the one who checked for monsters at night when Lucy heard scary sounds, would picked her from school, pay for her extracurricular activities, taught her how to ride a bike, drive a car, change a tire, and told her multiple times to not take any crap from guys who were losers. I did so happily because I loved her and her mom, and while I never expected to be more important Joe, I had hoped that I could at least be equal to him in Lucy's eyes but I was wrong.\n\nWhen Lucy turned 16 Joe finally started getting his act together and became more consistent in Lucy's life. I was happy that she was finally getting the attention she craved from Joe but it was a little hurtful when she started blowing me off and backing out of last minute plans with me to hang out with Joe. I took it all in stride but Mary wasn't shy about confronting Lucy over it and they fought. Mary knew that I wold get upset but stay silent but when Lucy actually ask me in front of Mary during one of their fights, I felt like me saying anything other I was okay with it would make me the bad guy so Lucy would run with it.\n\nI confided in my wife about how I truly felt but told her that I didn't want to make Lucy feel like she had to spend time with me, so Mary eventually back off. I never said anything even when Lucy forgot about my birthday but I finally spoke out when Lucy told me that I wouldn't be one of the four people who would go to her high school graduation. She wanted her parents and maternal grandparents instead and I was hurt. I told her how I felt as calmly as I could but Lucy got defensive saying that it was her graduation, that Joe has barely ever been apart of any of her special events while I've been to plenty, how I never had a problem with her prioritizing Joe before, and that I was still invited to her graduation party so what was the big deal?\n\nI decided to just let it go but was heartbroken. Then I got a call from my niece \"Allison\" (21f) and asked me if I would come to her college graduation in my brother's place (he passed away) I agreed. Allison's college is in another state and on the same week as Lucy's in addition to it being her birthday a few days later. Allison would like for me to stay until her birthday and Mary told me that I should go. So I decided to give Lucy her graduation gift early and when I told her that I wouldn't be present at her party she freaked out on me. She accused me of abandoning her as punishment but I see it more as supporting my brother's only daughter when he can't so AITA?  \n\n\nEditing in for more information since someone asked:   \n\n\n1. Again, my wife fully supports me going to see Allison and miss Lucy's graduation for it.\n2. Allison doesn't have a step/bonus/adoptive dad, so she's often looked towards me and her maternal grandfather for that fatherly role. \n3. Allison's graduation is on a Thursday while Lucy's is on Friday and Allison's birthday is on Saturday. So I would leave on Wednesday and come back on Sunday/Monday.", "created_utc": 1683433975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13acua7/wibta_if_i_missed_my_stepdaughters_graduation/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know your heart is in the right place. \n\nI think Lucy is happy her dad is back around but she knows you are her stability and always have been and the idea of Joe bailing on her is hurtful but it\u2019s expected but not of you.

You go where you're wanted and appreciated.", "NTA. Lucy is a hypocrite.", "NTA your stepdaughter is an adult and made an adult decision to treat you as a standby instead of a loved parent that raised her.

It sounds like Lucy isn't liking that taste of her own medicine you're giving her. Oh well. Not your problem.

Why do you think you have the right to be invited to my graduation? I refuse to let you come and I don't want you there but how very dare you not come to the party and abandon me?\". Fucking ridiculous.\n\nYour stepdaughter has made her choice, you have calmly and graciously removed yourself from courting controversy and have made other, very noble, arrangements to support your niece.\n\nIf your stepdaughter does not want you at the graduation, why is she so insistent you attend her party?\n\nLucy can invite who she likes, although there may be consequences, but you are NTA for missing her graduation party in order to attend your niece's.\n\nEnjoy your trip.", "Prepared for downvotes, but ESH.\n\nLucy for forgetting your birthday.\n\nYou for staying silent when she asked you how you felt about her spending more time with her dad than you, then throwing your feelings at her when she made decisions based at least partly on your silence.\n\nEverything else is N A H in my book.\n\nYou are not the AH for missing her party to support your niece. It\u2019s beautiful that you can be there for her to support her. I\u2019m glad she has that. You should not feel at all guilty for attending her graduation.\n\nLucy\u2019s reaction to you missing her party is understandable given the timing. It *would* feel like you were ditching because you aren\u2019t getting a ticket to the graduation. But it\u2019s clear she does actually want you at the party. You are her dependable rock and she never in her wildest dreams thought you wouldn\u2019t be there for her. Yes, she\u2019s taken that for granted recently but *all kids* should be able to take their parents\u2019 love for granted. Lucy\u2019s been put through the wringer with her father and is trying to make that relationship happen and I don\u2019t think she could have imagined that making that relationship happen might mean losing you.\n\nYou\u2019ve both been feeling rejected. Her first by her dad. Then you by her when dad reentered the scene. Now her again, this time by you.\n\nI hope you can all work through this.

You sound like a great guy who has opened his heart to your stepdaughter and niece.\n\nI understand how hurtful it must be to not be invited to the graduation. But try to put yourself in her shoes. Its not like she has 10 tickets. Its either you or her bio-dad.\n\nSpeaking from experience, I never was able to get over the abandonment from my mother and was still falling into the trap of craving her attention into my mid 30s. Its probably the most common childhood trauma out there. Pretty much every sitcom on earth has a trope about it. I keep thinking of The Fresh Prince episode (very emotional episode). \n\nShe is only 18 and is trying to figure out how to navigate these relationships. Its not easy. And you are entitled to feel hurt by her decision. I think she is old enough to have a mature conversation about it with her as well. But its not an easy conversation to have.\n\nAlso NTA for going to Alison's graduation. There is nothing wrong deciding to go where you will feel loved and welcomed and able to share in someones joy. You can tell your daughter that its not punishment, but there are consequences when we choose to prioritize other people your lives.", "Lucy wants to eat her cake and save it too.
