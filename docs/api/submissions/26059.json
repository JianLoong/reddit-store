Recently, a new girl (25F) joined because her father passed away and she needed the money. Her dad was a powerful and influential man and we all knew that.\n\nAnyway, she is very liberal and open minded even though we work in a very conservative environment. She is also very na\u00efve. She brings in cake, tea, lunch and ice cream for everyone at work from time to time even though no one does the same for her.\n\nWell eventually, she and I became friends. She would joke with me, lightly touch me and invite me to hangout with her mom and friends. Except that I knew this would lead to gossip and it sure did. Our coworkers started gossiping about us two dating secretly and called her easy behind her back. So, I had to make a bad choice.\n\nI texted her a few nights ago that we can't be friends anymore because people are saying shit about us. Instead of understanding, she asked me to elaborate. So I told her the truth. She remained quiet a bit then said goodnight. And that was it.\n\nIt's been 2 days since that conversation and she has gone dead silent. She doesn't talk to anyone and specifically ignores me even if I greet her first. It was her birthday today and she didn't even tell anyone or celebrate. I feel like shit for being the one to tell her but I couldn't bear to see her career and character being affected by accusations.\n\nSo reddit AITA? I should apologize, shouldn't I?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice. I felt terrible and apologized to her in-person and on text as well. She ignored me in-person but did reply on text and I think she did forgive me. I also planned to bring her a cake on Monday to celebrate her birthday but she said she doesn't need a cake because she doesn't like anyone at work enough to celebrate with them. However, she has invited me to hangout with her friends sometime in the future so I guess we're alright now?\n\nEDIT 2: I suppose my apology isn't enough and that's why she refused the cake. I suppose it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I thought our friendship wouldn't work and essentially destroyed it myself. I hope she is doing okay. She's a fighter.\n\nEDIT 3: I am deeply sorry for my actions and the guilt is eating at me. I am sorry, Reddit. And I'm sorry to my dear friend who needed me but I was too much of a p\\*\\*\\*\\* to step in and help her\n\nFINAL EDIT: She sent me a text on whatsapp with a link to this thread asking if that's me. I confessed. She started laughing and asked me if I learnt my lesson yet. I was too upset to make jokes so I didn't answer. After a while, she texted me that she was still mad at me but she accepted my apology.

You were not afraid of her career, you were afraid of how the gossip would effect yours.

Creating a hostile work environment for your friend and 2. False. Did you even try to correct the gossip when you heard it?

Go back to your cult. She doesn't need your help from you \"conservatives\". You made that clear.  \n\nAnd if you feel bad, good for you her.  That's what you should feel. Cause what she felt was x2 worse. \n\nTake this as a learning experience and just do better.\n\nEdit : I read your edit, and I think she's just being nice but she's prob going to regret that in the future. Don't try to impose yourself into a friendship again, if she actually gives you another chance.

Many people from wealthy or influential families may not need the money but want the independence, respect and purpose that earning a wage brings. Sounds like she had a bit of both while also being kind in her first job to share with co workers small treats and somehow she\u2019s committed a workplace sin and been ostracised and the person she trusted threw her under the bus to boot.\n\nHow does conservative play into this? She was trickling down her resources. I thought conservatives loved that. She was also a woman  serving food when no one else did. Again popular with conservatives. Yet its the conservatives suggesting she\u2019s what? Swapping cake for sexual favours to get the job?
