Recently, a new girl (25F) joined because her father passed away and she needed the money. Her dad was a powerful and influential man and we all knew that.\n\nAnyway, she is very liberal and open minded even though we work in a very conservative environment. She is also very na\u00efve. She brings in cake, tea, lunch and ice cream for everyone at work from time to time even though no one does the same for her.\n\nWell eventually, she and I became friends. She would joke with me, lightly touch me and invite me to hangout with her mom and friends. Except that I knew this would lead to gossip and it sure did. Our coworkers started gossiping about us two dating secretly and called her easy behind her back. So, I had to make a bad choice.\n\nI texted her a few nights ago that we can't be friends anymore because people are saying shit about us. Instead of understanding, she asked me to elaborate. So I told her the truth. She remained quiet a bit then said goodnight. And that was it.\n\nIt's been 2 days since that conversation and she has gone dead silent. She doesn't talk to anyone and specifically ignores me even if I greet her first. It was her birthday today and she didn't even tell anyone or celebrate. I feel like shit for being the one to tell her but I couldn't bear to see her career and character being affected by accusations.\n\nSo reddit AITA? I should apologize, shouldn't I?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice. I felt terrible and apologized to her in-person and on text as well. She ignored me in-person but did reply on text and I think she did forgive me. I also planned to bring her a cake on Monday to celebrate her birthday but she said she doesn't need a cake because she doesn't like anyone at work enough to celebrate with them. However, she has invited me to hangout with her friends sometime in the future so I guess we're alright now?  \n\n\nEDIT 2: I suppose my apology isn't enough and that's why she refused the cake. I suppose it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I thought our friendship wouldn't work and essentially destroyed it myself. I hope she is doing okay.

You were not afraid of her career, you were afraid of how the gossip would effect yours.

The first one being to give her the heads up that you think gossip might start because of the way you behave together, given that you apparently \u201cknew it was going to happen\u201d. \n\nYou also should have reported the gossip to HR, as it is 1. Creating a hostile work environment for your friend and 2. False. Did you even try to correct the gossip when you heard it?

Go back to your cult. She doesn't need your help from you \"conservatives\". You made that clear.  \n\nAnd if you feel bad, good for you her.  That's what you should feel. Cause what she felt was x2 worse. \n\nTake this as a learning experience and just do better.\n\nEdit : I read your edit, and I think she's just being nice but she's prob going to regret that in the future.

Many people from wealthy or influential families may not need the money but want the independence, respect and purpose that earning a wage brings. Sounds like she had a bit of both while also being kind in her first job to share with co workers small treats and somehow she\u2019s committed a workplace sin and been ostracised and the person she trusted threw her under the bus to boot.\n\nHow does conservative play into this? She was trickling down her resources. I thought conservatives loved that. She was also a woman  serving food when no one else did. Again popular with conservatives. Yet its the conservatives suggesting she\u2019s what? Swapping cake for sexual favours to get the job?

You have the gall to think you are innocent?\n\nYou told her that you can no longer be friends because of office gossip. So what if you claim that you weren't the one who badmouthed her? You are still the accomplice. It doesn't make you a good person. And sticking out how? By wearing different clothes? By buying you all cakes and tea? By being an overall nice person??????????\n\nWe may live in a bad world, but being good is a choice, and you didn't make it.\n\nI am telling you. Leave her alone. You ARE a horrid person.", "Yea okay, that's fair enough.  Just needed more context haha", "She doesn't forgive you. Leave her alone.  You people sexualized her in the workplace by calling her easy and you sided with them. You're not coming back from that brom she clearly sees your politics.", "I should also add that you aren't doing this to get her friendship back - that's up to her. You're doing this to be a better person, make amends, and to name it clear that you're on the side of kindness and cakes in future, not on silly gossip.", "Leave her alone, please. \nYou did enough damage already.", "Well, she did, and a good one to not be associated with OP. OP needs to stop being obsessed and move on and let her move on as well.", "I mean either way, she was the one kind and genuine person in the office and you want to alienate *her*? \n\nBuddy. Priorities.", "I think it's not implausible, but she did extend the invitation so hopefully nothing is lost. I might be wrong of course, but if you get along and are both single... Then again you work at the same place so thread carefully.", "How the hell are we supposed to know?", "I am a product of my surroundings and acknowledged that I made a mistake. There's not really anything else I can say.", "You're just telling him how to feel, this dude only cares about getting a friendship back clearly.", "Someone pointed it out that's why I asked", "Yes, you can. You can stop your coworkers from gossiping about her by reporting their slutshaming comments to the HR. You can escalate the issue to the higher-ups. You can simply shut it down whenever a coworker talks shit about her the next time.\n\nGrow a spine. You can absolutely do a lot if you actually acknowledge that you made a mistake. \n\nOr you can simply disappear into the dark corners of your toxic office and let karma run its course on each and every one of you.", "You\u2019re attempting to dissolve yourself of any and all responsibilities for your OWN actions and decisions. You\u2019re not a \u201cproduct of your surroundings\u201d you are a spineless coward with zero conviction. Say that in a mirror. Be better."]}
