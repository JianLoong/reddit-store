You say, \u201cI don\u2019t care who pays what so long as X amount is paid every month. And if the water and electric bill are going up, X amount has to be paid. I don\u2019t care who pays it, but it needs to be covered.\u201d So, if the gf can\u2019t pay, then her bf had to step in and cover the additional costs.
