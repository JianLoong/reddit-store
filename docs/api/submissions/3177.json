Today, I posted to my Facebook and made a post regarding my son not speaking to me, I called him ungrateful and told him that he is very unappreciative for anything I\u2019ve done for him as I raised him as a single mother throughout my life and even allowed him to live under my roof into his adulthood. His wife, 25F has a son, 10M that she does not share with my son, but her son does have a social media and since I have been unable to get through to he or his wife that i have not met as of yet, i reached out to her son, and politely asked that he pass the message to my son or his mother. \n\n My son finally messaged me back, told me that i ruined his life and asked me to leave he and his family alone. He threatened to file a restraining order if u contacted them again and I told him that I don\u2019t feel I should stop because a mothers love doesn\u2019t end and I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation especially with it being the holidays.

Leave him alone, and do not drag a literal child into your disagreement with your son.", "Wow, YTA completely. Involving a 10 year old you've never even met? Take the hint, you screwed up up so badly your kid wants nothing to do with you, leave them alone and get a truckload of therapy", "YTA - You obviously did something - no one goes NC for no reason at all.  And what grandparents rights do you think you have?  You have never met the 2 year olds, and the older one has nothing to do with you at all.   There is no relationship for you to claim any rights over.\n\nWhilst a 10 year old shouldn't be on facebook, you had no business contacting him - he is a child and has nothing to do with your problems.\n\nThere is clearly a big chunk of this story missing - specifically what happened with your 'then husband', and what did you do (or not do) about it?", "YTA - Missing reasons galore. Leave this dude alone, he doesn't want you in his life.", "If calling him \u201cungrateful\u201d doesn\u2019t make him see the error of his ways, then nothing will. And reaching out to a 10y/o child that you\u2019ve never met and asking him to express your criticisms to his stepfather is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  Congratulations you are a stalker and YTA.", "YTA. First off, you leave children alone. It is absolutely unacceptable to contact a *ten year old* for something like this.\n\nSecond off, I think you *do* understand why your son has gone this level of no contact with you. You just also think you should be able to stomp all over his boundaries and treat him however you want and he should be happy and grateful for it.", "YTA. Using your Facebook to complain and call your son ungrateful is not you reaching out to him for the holidays. You should also leave your son's stepchild alone. You're not doing any of this in good faith. You should be sending messages to your son to ask him to get in touch. \n\nYou need to stop, OP. If you really love and respect your son, you will respect his wishes or you will deal with the consequences your son has set out. I really would like to know what you thought the response would be here when you're calling him ungrateful, but honestly, it doesn't matter. \n\nAccept what has happened and find a way to enjoy the holiday season.", "YTA\n\n\nYou contacted a child?\n\n\nYou have no idea what happened?\n\n\nYou are so out of line.", "YTA. You involved a 10-year-old kid? Yeah, with behavior like that, good luck with the whole grandparents rights thing.\n\nI don\u2019t for one moment believe this is about your \u201clove\u201d for him. What you are doing isn\u2019t love. It\u2019s harassment. I also don\u2019t believe that this is anywhere near the entire story.", "YTA, your behavior is narcissistic and it also definitely sounds like you are leaving out large parts of the story.", "YTA\n\n\n>my son seems to see things differently but refuses to tell me the reasons as to what I have done\n\nIt sounds like you understand he has a different perspective on you shared history, so he clearly **has** spoken to you about it. I can't help wondering if he has told you his reasons for going no contact, and you just don't accept them as valid. Therefore you believe he has no excuse for cutting you off. Google \"the missing missing reasons\" and see if this rings any bells.\n\n>Today, I posted to my Facebook and made a post regarding my son not speaking to me, I called him ungrateful and told him that he is very unappreciative\n\nAntagonizing the people you want to be close to in a public forum is rarely successful. It also makes you look attention-hungry and un-selfaware.\n\n>since I have been unable to get through to he or his wife that i have not met as of yet, i reached out to her son\n\nHarassing a 10 year old on social media is almost guaranteed to get an angry response from he carers.\n\n>I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation especially with it being the holidays.\n\nLook, it doesn't matter if you think his explanations and actions are reasonable or not. He holds all the power here. If you ever want to have any kind of contact, you have to accept that you have to do things his way, humble yourself, apologise and abide by his boundaries. \n\nBased on what you have written here, it seems you are only concerned about your feelings, your rights, and your wants. To re-establish a civil relationship, you are going to need to prioritise your son and honour his feelings, rights and needs. \n\nDo you want a connection, or do you want to be Right? Choose carefully.", "YTA - Respect his wishes. He wants to cut all contact and doesn\u2019t want you reaching out. You can love him from afar. He doesn\u2019t owe you access to him or his children. If there\u2019s ever a chance that he wants a relationship with you in the future, you need to respect his wishes. Forcing yourself on him is only going to do further damage.", "YTA - your behaviour is so offside. \n\n1- posting publicly on Facebook talking crap about your son for everyone to see\n\n2- contacting a 10 year old child on Facebook is beyond out of line to do \n\n3- threatening your son you\u2019re going to take him to court\n\nThis behaviour is so offside, so unacceptable. This type of behaviour will continue to push your son away. \n\nYou need to seek therapy and stop attempting to contact him. Absolutely DO NOT contact his wife or child either.\n\nEdited to add just because you raised a child, you are not entitled to anything from them when you treat them horribly. That\u2019s all. Hope you get help for your issues.", "YTA. This just screams of missing missing reasons and denial of needing to take personal responsibility. You saying your son wouldn't tell you what was so bad he went NC means either he did and you don't want to admit it or that it was so bad he couldn't talk about it, both indications of failure on your part.\n\nYou're also the AH for involving a child, an innocent you have no relation too by blood or emotion. The relationship you had, past tense, evolved from mother and child to that between adults, and you don't seem to have understood that. Relationships are two way with mutual respect, you only talk about what you want while criticising your son for denying you this, it's neither two way nor mutually respectful. Your actions, past and present, have cost you a future with the boy you raised. If you pursue legal action it will make something already bad far worse.", "YTA  \nIf your post was about calling him ungrateful, how do you think he will suddenly talk to you? You realised you made a mistake and now you do not want to face the consequences but the mistakes of the past will always come to bite you back.", "YTA, obviously\nWhat part of \"no contact\" do you not understand? Also, pretty sure you don't get \"grandparents' rights\" when you've never met the grandchildren...", "Your son's made it repeatedly clear that he doesn't want anything to do with you.   If he changes his mind, I'm sure that you'll be the first to find out, but, until then, leave him in peace.\n\nYTA", "Girl! Leave him alone !!!!!!

Bottom line, your son wants nothing to do with you and you have no right to force a relationship on him or his son.  Whatever happened between you and your now Ex your conduct, ignoring your son's wishes and threatening court action, supports his position far better than yours.", "When restraining orders break out then someone is pushing too hard, sorry lady, you gotta lay off and hope he gets over whatever it is and stops by sometime.\n\nOn a side note, if ya can't get in touch with him the normal way never make an end run to get there, it only pisses them off more. Best of luck.", "YTA, he doesn\u2019t want to have contact with you and you should respect that. you also made a public facebook post shaming him of course he isn\u2019t going to want to speak with you. don\u2019t reach out to a 10 year old you have never met, just leave them alone.", "YTA   If you can\u2019t accept responsibility for anything you\u2019ve done to him, shit that\u2019s so severe he\u2019s gone NC, you dont deserve him as a son and you definitely don\u2019t deserve to be a grandparent. You have 0 rights to those children. Also contacting his step son?? What is wrong with you???? The audacity radiating off you can be felt all the way over here", "Hard YTA. He clearly wants no contact with you, and you think the best way to make amends is by publicly blasting him on social media, then contacting a child with no relationship with him? You also clearly have no idea what grandparents' rights are.", "YTA. There are obviously reasons your son doesn\u2019t want to be involved with you. Not mention, contacting a 10 year old child not even related to you to do your dirty work is certifiable. Maybe do some actual reflection on your parenting to figure out why you\u2019re here in this position. \n\nPS - Good luck getting grandparent rights. It\u2019s meant to preserve relationships already established between grandparents and grandchildren. Not to force one.", "YTA for dragging a 10 year old child into this. You knew your son was getting your messages and choosing not to respond, and instead of respecting his wishes, you harrassed his 10 year old stepson in order to drag a response out of him. And I find it very hard to believe that he never told you why he cut you off.", "YTA. The Facebook post was manipulative and you posted it to get others to gang up on your son and they tell him what a terrible son he is. \n\nBecause of this, why are you so surprised by his reaction? If this post is an indication of how you treat your son, I can\u2019t imagine what else you put him through. Especially for him to completely cut you out of communication.\n\nAlso, you post here, is missing details and is too broad for the story (and it is a story) you  are trying to sell to Reddit for sympathy.", "YTA. You haven\u2019t listened to your son, you blasted him on social media, dragged his poor step son into this mess and are now threatening him\u2026? Did I get that right? \n\nI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a lot more to the story too\u2026", ">I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation\n\nINFO what's the unreasonable explanation your son gave you?", "INFO - You posted something private on Facebook, publicly? Not OK in any circumstance. There's something about the way you treat your son that you aren't admitting.", "oh, wow....I'm betting I can guess WHY your son went NC with you.\n\nYour 'explanation' of what you did/didn't do along with reaching out to A TEN YEAR OLD CHILD via facebook WTF are you thinking woman?!?!  Bashing your son on your facebook then telling him that you will sue HIM for grandparent rights?!?! OMG...just...wow.  Save your money, you won't win that battle. I'm betting your son has plenty of examples of why you shouldn't be allowed visitation with his children. \n\nYou just shown how exactly NOT to go about trying to reconcile with someone. You must have some inkling about what you did or how you upset your son - I'm sure he told you many times in the past and you chose to ignore and dismiss his feelings.", "YTA - grandparents rights lol there really is no such thing.  You threatened to sue your son.  He cut you out.  You aren\u2019t owed anything.", "YTA. He\u2019s probably told you multiple times why he wants nothing to do with you and you either ignored it because you didn\u2019t want to hear it or didn\u2019t think it was bad enough to warrant cutting off contact. Leave him alone. You proved to him that he was right to cut you off by ranting about him on Facebook (likely in a public post) and contacting his 10 year-old stepson.", "YTA so he just cut you off with no explanation or was it that he gave you one and you just can\u2019t accept it. The fact that it\u2019s been 5 years and he\u2019s threatening a restraining order tells me it\u2019s much more to the story than what you\u2019re sharing. Also, threatening him with grandparent rights is a sure fire way to make sure that this relationship will be permanently damaged. Just leave him alone.", "YTA. Oof I love it when parents do this and can't understand why they've been cut off because clearly you can see why....you were cut off because you didn't support your son. Instead you chose to believe your husband over him.

What do you want? A pay on the back for raising the child you had? Apparently you didn\u2019t do a very good job if you son wants nothing to do with you. Good luck taking him to court for grandparent rights. You\u2019ll be wasting your money since you clearly don\u2019t understand what grandparents rights really are.", "YTA.\n\nYou want to know what a parent's job is? A parent's job is to raise functioning, happy adults. Your children do not owe you happiness.\n\nHow dare you try to put a child in the middle? Why would you write a post about how your child hurt you or how disappointed you are? He is so disappointed with you he went no contact.\n\nLeave him alone. You have no right to be a part of his life and he has made his decision. \n\nBe enough of a mom to respect it.", "YTA:\n\nCan you say stalker bringing an innocent 10 year old into this? Leave them alone and if or when your son wants to read out he will! Being the way you are is only going to alienate them more and get the police involved.", "You do realize you have shown everyone here why your son wants nothing to do with your narcissistic self.

I mean don't reach out to a 10 year, that's obvious on the internet, but I'm really curious and can't pass judgement without know what happened. Did you two fight? Did you not fight for him? Was he a rebellious teen?

Leave him to live his life", "YTA how can you talk about the love of a mother while you're being insulting him? You play the victim and you publicly attack him on social medias saying he was ungrateful because you allowed him to live in your house after is 18th birthday and putting a minor in the middle of all this, sending him messages.

It's not about right or wrong or if you deserve it. It's his choice. The only thing you can do is make it clear that you are here when or if he's ready to talk, and then leave him alone. Anything outside of that is legally harassment, and he can take legal action against you. \n\nYou claim not to know the reason. Here's a hard truth: if he didn't have a reason before he does now. It is NEVER appropriate or acceptable to bring children into adult conflict.  If the message you gave the 10 year old was to please ask your son to contact you, it still would have been inappropriate because that child is now involved. To be frank with you, were I that child's mother that alone would be reason enough to stop including you. If your judgment and sense of propriety is so poor that you deemed that action acceptable,  I cannot trust you with harder or more delicate things, and absolutely cannot trust you where my child is concerned.  So if there wasn't a reason before there definitely is now. \n\nBut let's pretend that it was ok to involve a child. Your  message was not a simple request for a response. You insulted the man that child lives with at least part of the time. You have NO IDEA what is going on in their home life. What if that child is struggling with accepting your son as a father figure and processing his bio parents relationship, and your comment just undid months or years of work? What if your son is the only father figure he has, and he had to hear you talk about him like that? It was so wildly inappropriate I can't believe you actually said that to a 10 year old. Especially if you have no relationship with said child. Your choice of words in that situation demonstrates a total lack of understanding and respecting others. Again, if I were the child's mother, I would let your son know in no uncertain terms that you were never to be allowed contact with my child again.  \n\nBut let's take it another step and pretend your word choice was acceptable, and I and the child's mother are just being too sensitive. It is their right as adults to tell you no. You may not like it, but like before, there's nothing you can really do. And you know that, which is why you threatened him with court. \n\nSo here's where you're at. If you don't carry through with your threat nothing will change. But if you do, believe me when I say you will never get what you want. If you're lucky, the worst will be that your child will take his family and disappear, keeping you from serving him and ending any hope of you ever hearing from him again. If you do succeed in taking him to court, no judge in their right mind would give you any rights after your antics with the 10 year old. And this is without knowing what other inappropriate or possibly abusive behavior your son might bring to light. If you've gone nuclear with bringing court into this, your son will have nothing to lose and everything to gain by bringing everything up. And with a few exceptions, you don't qualify for grandparents rights. You have no relationship with those children, and doing and end run against their parents won't get you what you really want.\n\nWhether you think he is right or wrong, you must respect your son's decisions.", "Signs of an asshole:\n\n\n>Grandparents rights\n\nA phrase used exclusively by asshole grandparents who think they are entitled to unlimited access to grandchildren\n\n\n>for no reasonable explanation\n\nYou admit that he told you why he went no contact.

We were broke, but that was a literal turning point and should have been a happy time, but instead of trying to find a new job as a nurse, I was busy working overtime night shifts as a PCT so I could buy secondhand furniture for her room in case the CPS people inspected. We eventually let the sister back into our lives, but his mother was estranged until her death. He said he loved her and forgave her, but just couldn't allow her back into his life.

At 14 I started calling him out for always saying my mom was \u201cputting words in my mouth\u201d and that it\u2019s possible for me to form my own opinions that happen to align with my moms. At 16 I stopped going over to his place unless I absolutely had to. At 17 I outright told him I didn\u2019t know how to spend time with him other than movies and food. At 18 I called him out for taking us to a fucking PUB for dinner when I had just gotten out of the hospital and was on medication where I couldn\u2019t have any oily foods, alcohol, or meat. At 19 he started \u201crain checking\u201d our dinners weekly to the point that I went 9 months without actually seeing him, when I did see him he chewed me out for \u201cnot trying hard enough to get a job\u201d (how would he know if he hasn\u2019t even seen me in almost a year??) then told me he was cutting me off his healthcare (which I could have stayed on until 25 or until I got a full time job, whichever comes first). At 20 I called him out for being an alcoholic and verbally abusive to us growing up, he\u2019s only response was a \u201cwell, I was drinking a lot back then\u201d and then forced me to change the subject. At 22 I finally had enough and cut him out of my life. But he \u201chas no idea what happened\u201d.\n\nSure, I didn\u2019t directly tell him all the verbal abuse completely destroyed my self worth. I didn\u2019t tell him the mental abuse gave me an eating disorder and depression and anxiety. I didn\u2019t tell him the financial abuse gave me complex\u2019s about gifting love languages and stability. But honestly? If you need to be directly told all that after decades of mistreating someone, it\u2019s not because you don\u2019t *know* what happened; it\u2019s because you don\u2019t *care.*", "That is the funniest part... /s", "This exactly.", "And he's been NC since 21 if I read it right, so hey wow, so generous to give him shelter in his 18th to 20th year.

He's been NC for ten years with his dad (my ex, who's likely NPD). After my son got married, my ex messaged his wife on Facebook. She had never met this person, knew what had happened, and it really creeped her out. But it was because \"my son won't talk to me, so what choice do I have?\". I just thought you set yourself back a long way now. The other 2 kids eventually dropped him from their lives. \n\nAt one point my oldest was struggling with whether he should move toward his dad, and his younger brother who was engaged to be married then said: \"I believe that now my main job is to love and serve and protect my wife and any children we may have together. That includes protecting them from the emotional abuse that will come from having him in our lives, even a little bit. I have forgiven him, and you need to forgive him too, but I'm not letting him near anyone I have the responsibility to protect.\"\n\nThat boy was 24 years old then and my oldest was 27. It's a lot to have to think about and I'm very sad that i chose this man to be their dad. I know their dad's history and it's horrific.

In principle you could meet these requirements without having ever met the child.", "There was (hopefully past tense) this highly irresponsible psychobabble going around when I came of age in the 80s that *demanded* you confront your abuser with the truth about why you want nothing to do with them. Like you owed them that much. Like you were going to feel \"resolved\"and \"complete\" if you told them what they did to deserve NC. This thread proves you probably won't, and it's a waste of time and energy (not to mention the emotional exhaustion and reliving of the abuse) to try. It's one thing if they're open, dropping defenses to listen, working on self-awareness. Never really seen that in my abusers, though I've fallen for attempts to make it look like they are, which is even worse than the alternative. A long way of saying I agree wholeheartedly that we do not owe abusive people an explanation. Like one of my better therapists said, \"Let her figure it out.\" If she can't, that couldn't possibly be less my problem.", "Yeah but I think that consistently trying to be in the child\u2019s life and also being low contact or no contact with your own son for five years, they don\u2019t stand a chance.

The only reason I still see her is because I want to see my dad. Oh and because my brothers are asshats and think I should have to take care of her instead of them.
