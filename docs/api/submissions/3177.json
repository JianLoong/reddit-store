Today, I posted to my Facebook and made a post regarding my son not speaking to me, I called him ungrateful and told him that he is very unappreciative for anything I\u2019ve done for him as I raised him as a single mother throughout my life and even allowed him to live under my roof into his adulthood. His wife, 25F has a son, 10M that she does not share with my son, but her son does have a social media and since I have been unable to get through to he or his wife that i have not met as of yet, i reached out to her son, and politely asked that he pass the message to my son or his mother. \n\n My son finally messaged me back, told me that i ruined his life and asked me to leave he and his family alone. He threatened to file a restraining order if u contacted them again and I told him that I don\u2019t feel I should stop because a mothers love doesn\u2019t end and I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation especially with it being the holidays.

Leave him alone, and do not drag a literal child into your disagreement with your son.", "Wow, YTA completely. Involving a 10 year old you've never even met? Take the hint, you screwed up up so badly your kid wants nothing to do with you, leave them alone and get a truckload of therapy", "YTA - You obviously did something - no one goes NC for no reason at all.  And what grandparents rights do you think you have?  You have never met the 2 year olds, and the older one has nothing to do with you at all.   There is no relationship for you to claim any rights over.\n\nWhilst a 10 year old shouldn't be on facebook, you had no business contacting him - he is a child and has nothing to do with your problems.\n\nThere is clearly a big chunk of this story missing - specifically what happened with your 'then husband', and what did you do (or not do) about it?", "YTA - Missing reasons galore. Leave this dude alone, he doesn't want you in his life.", "If calling him \u201cungrateful\u201d doesn\u2019t make him see the error of his ways, then nothing will. And reaching out to a 10y/o child that you\u2019ve never met and asking him to express your criticisms to his stepfather is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  Congratulations you are a stalker and YTA.", "YTA. First off, you leave children alone. It is absolutely unacceptable to contact a *ten year old* for something like this.\n\nSecond off, I think you *do* understand why your son has gone this level of no contact with you. You just also think you should be able to stomp all over his boundaries and treat him however you want and he should be happy and grateful for it.", "YTA. Using your Facebook to complain and call your son ungrateful is not you reaching out to him for the holidays. You should also leave your son's stepchild alone. You're not doing any of this in good faith. You should be sending messages to your son to ask him to get in touch. \n\nYou need to stop, OP. If you really love and respect your son, you will respect his wishes or you will deal with the consequences your son has set out. I really would like to know what you thought the response would be here when you're calling him ungrateful, but honestly, it doesn't matter. \n\nAccept what has happened and find a way to enjoy the holiday season.", "YTA\n\n\nYou contacted a child?\n\n\nYou have no idea what happened?\n\n\nYou are so out of line.", "YTA. You involved a 10-year-old kid? Yeah, with behavior like that, good luck with the whole grandparents rights thing.\n\nI don\u2019t for one moment believe this is about your \u201clove\u201d for him. What you are doing isn\u2019t love. It\u2019s harassment. I also don\u2019t believe that this is anywhere near the entire story.", "YTA, your behavior is narcissistic and it also definitely sounds like you are leaving out large parts of the story.", "YTA\n\n\n>my son seems to see things differently but refuses to tell me the reasons as to what I have done\n\nIt sounds you understand he has a different perspective on you shared history, so he clearly **has** spoken to you about it. I can't help wondering if he has told you his reasons for going no contact, and you just don't accept them as valid. Thereforeypu believe  he has no excuses for cutting you off. Google \"the missing missing reasons\" and see if this rings any bells.\n\n>Today, I posted to my Facebook and made a post regarding my son not speaking to me, I called him ungrateful and told him that he is very unappreciative\n\nAntagonizing the people you want to be close to in a public forum is rarely successful. It also makes you look attention-hingry and un-selfaware.\n\n>since I have been unable to get through to he or his wife that i have not met as of yet, i reached out to her son\n\nHarassing a 10 year old on social media is almost guaranteed to get an angry response from he carers.\n\n>I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation especially with it being the holidays.\n\nLook, it doesn't matter if you think his explanations and actions are reasonable or not. He holds all the power here. If you ever want to have any kind of contact, you have to accept that you have to do things his way, humble yourself, apologise and abide by his boundaries. \n\nBased on what you have written here, it seems you are only concerned about your feelings, your rights, and your wants. To re-establish a civil relationship, you are going to need to prioritise your son and honour his feelings, rights and needs. \n\nDo you want a connection, or do you want to be Right? Choose carefully.", "YTA - Respect his wishes. He wants to cut all contact and doesn\u2019t want you reaching out. You can love him from afar. He doesn\u2019t owe you access to him or his children. If there\u2019s ever a chance that he wants a relationship with you in the future, you need to respect his wishes. Forcing yourself on him is only going to do further damage.", "YTA - your behaviour is so offside. \n\n1- posting publicly on Facebook talking crap about your son for everyone to see\n\n2- contacting a 10 year old child on Facebook is beyond out of line to do \n\n3- threatening your son you\u2019re going to take him to court\n\nThis behaviour is so offside, so unacceptable. This type of behaviour will continue to push your son away. \n\nYou need to seek therapy and stop attempting to contact him. Absolutely DO NOT contact his wife or child either.\n\nEdited to add just because you raised a child, you are not entitled to anything from them when you treat them horribly. That\u2019s all. Hope you get help for your issues.", "YTA. This just screams of missing missing reasons and denial of needing to take personal responsibility. You saying your son wouldn't tell you what was so bad he went NC means either he did and you don't want to admit it or that it was so bad he couldn't talk about it, both indications of failure on your part.\n\nYou're also the AH for involving a child, an innocent you have no relation too by blood or emotion. The relationship you had, past tense, evolved from mother and child to that between adults, and you don't seem to have understood that. Relationships are two way with mutual respect, you only talk about what you want while criticising your son for denying you this, it's neither two way nor mutually respectful. Your actions, past and present, have cost you a future with the boy you raised. If you pursue legal action it will make something already bad far worse.", "YTA  \nIf your post was about calling him ungrateful, how do you think he will suddenly talk to you? You realised you made a mistake and now you do not want to face the consequences but the mistakes of the past will always come to bite you back.", "YTA, obviously\nWhat part of \"no contact\" do you not understand? Also, pretty sure you don't get \"grandparents' rights\" when you've never met the grandchildren...", "Your son's made it repeatedly clear that he doesn't want anything to do with you.   If he changes his mind, I'm sure that you'll be the first to find out, but, until then, leave him in peace.\n\nYTA", "Girl! Leave him alone !!!!!!

Bottom line, your son wants nothing to do with you and you have no right to force a relationship on him or his son.  Whatever happened between you and your now Ex your conduct, ignoring your son's wishes and threatening court action, supports his position far better than yours.", "When restraining orders break out then someone is pushing too hard, sorry lady, you gotta lay off and hope he gets over whatever it is and stops by sometime.\n\nOn a side note, if ya can't get in touch with him the normal way never make an end run to get there, it only pisses them off more. Best of luck.", "YTA, he doesn\u2019t want to have contact with you and you should respect that. you also made a public facebook post shaming him of course he isn\u2019t going to want to speak with you. don\u2019t reach out to a 10 year old you have never met, just leave them alone.", "YTA   If you can\u2019t accept responsibility for anything you\u2019ve done to him, shit that\u2019s so severe he\u2019s gone NC, you dont deserve him as a son and you definitely don\u2019t deserve to be a grandparent. You have 0 rights to those children. Also contacting his step son?? What is wrong with you???? The audacity radiating off you can be felt all the way over here", "Hard YTA. He clearly wants no contact with you, and you think the best way to make amends is by publicly blasting him on social media, then contacting a child with no relationship with him? You also clearly have no idea what grandparents' rights are.", "YTA. There are obviously reasons your son doesn\u2019t want to be involved with you. Not mention, contacting a 10 year old child not even related to you to do your dirty work is certifiable. Maybe do some actual reflection on your parenting to figure out why you\u2019re here in this position. \n\nPS - Good luck getting grandparent rights. It\u2019s meant to preserve relationships already established between grandparents and grandchildren. Not to force one.", "YTA for dragging a 10 year old child into this. You knew your son was getting your messages and choosing not to respond, and instead of respecting his wishes, you harrassed his 10 year old stepson in order to drag a response out of him. And I find it very hard to believe that he never told you why he cut you off.", "YTA. The Facebook post was manipulative and you posted it to get others to gang up on your son and they tell him what a terrible son he is. \n\nBecause of this, why are you so surprised by his reaction? If this post is an indication of how you treat your son, I can\u2019t imagine what else you put him through. Especially for him to completely cut you out of communication.\n\nAlso, you post here, is missing details and is too broad for the story (and it is a story) you  are trying to sell to Reddit for sympathy.", "YTA. You haven\u2019t listened to your son, you blasted him on social media, dragged his poor step son into this mess and are now threatening him\u2026? Did I get that right? \n\nI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a lot more to the story too\u2026", ">I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation\n\nINFO what's the unreasonable explanation your son gave you?", "INFO - You posted something private on Facebook, publicly? Not OK in any circumstance. There's something about the way you treat your son that you aren't admitting.", "oh, wow....I'm betting I can guess WHY your son went NC with you.\n\nYour 'explanation' of what you did/didn't do along with reaching out to A TEN YEAR OLD CHILD via facebook WTF are you thinking woman?!?!  Bashing your son on your facebook then telling him that you will sue HIM for grandparent rights?!?! OMG...just...wow.  Save your money, you won't win that battle. I'm betting your son has plenty of examples of why you shouldn't be allowed visitation with his children. \n\nYou just shown how exactly NOT to go about trying to reconcile with someone. You must have some inkling about what you did or how you upset your son - I'm sure he told you many times in the past and you chose to ignore and dismiss his feelings.", "YTA - grandparents rights lol there really is no such thing.  You threatened to sue your son.  He cut you out.  You aren\u2019t owed anything.", "YTA. He\u2019s probably told you multiple times why he wants nothing to do with you and you either ignored it because you didn\u2019t want to hear it or didn\u2019t think it was bad enough to warrant cutting off contact. Leave him alone. You proved to him that he was right to cut you off by ranting about him on Facebook (likely in a public post) and contacting his 10 year-old stepson.", "YTA so he just cut you off with no explanation or was it that he gave you one and you just can\u2019t accept it. The fact that it\u2019s been 5 years and he\u2019s threatening a restraining order tells me it\u2019s much more to the story than what you\u2019re sharing. Also, threatening him with grandparent rights is a sure fire way to make sure that this relationship will be permanently damaged. Just leave him alone.", "YTA. Oof I love it when parents do this and can't understand why they've been cut off because clearly you can see why....you were cut off because you didn't support your son. Instead you chose to believe your husband over him.

What do you want? A pay on the back for raising the child you had? Apparently you didn\u2019t do a very good job if you son wants nothing to do with you. Good luck taking him to court for grandparent rights. You\u2019ll be wasting your money since you clearly don\u2019t understand what grandparents rights really are.", "YTA.\n\nYou want to know what a parent's job is? A parent's job is to raise functioning, happy adults. Your children do not owe you happiness.\n\nHow dare you try to put a child in the middle? Why would you write a post about how your child hurt you or how disappointed you are? He is so disappointed with you he went no contact.\n\nLeave him alone. You have no right to be a part of his life and he has made his decision. \n\nBe enough of a mom to respect it.", "YTA:\n\nCan you say stalker bringing an innocent 10 year old into this? Leave them alone and if or when your son wants to read out he will! Being the way you are is only going to alienate them more and get the police involved.", "You do realize you have shown everyone here why your son wants nothing to do with your narcissistic self.

I mean don't reach out to a 10 year, that's obvious on the internet, but I'm really curious and can't pass judgement without know what happened. Did you two fight? Did you not fight for him? Was he a rebellious teen?

Leave him to live his life", "YTA how can you talk about the love of a mother while you're being insulting him? You play the victim and you publicly attack him on social medias saying he was ungrateful because you allowed him to live in your house after is 18th birthday and putting a minor in the middle of all this, sending him messages.

My Mom bent over backwards helping him (splurged big-time renting out a hotel for her side of the family for his wedding, big playground set for his daughter, and more).\n\nMeanwhile, she always told me, \"tough love Honey!\" \n\nMy brother got pissed when our Mom didn't buy him a farm when he was in his late 20s, totally screwed up his life, and after our Dad died said, \"I wish it was Mom instead of Dad!\" \n\nWhen I got married (granted, older and foregoing a formal service) my Mom sent me a pack of squirt guns and a check for $100. When my son was born, she gave me a pack of cotton \"brief\" underwear?? (Same mom who used to give me Victoria's secret gift cards when I was a teen, it ain't normal).\n\nAfter years of being the \"go between\", I finally stopped. My Mom had a few strokes, and even almost died from sepsis during COVID, and my brother would call me asking how Mom was, I'd say, \"call her and find out!\" (She couldn't even speak at the time, but the nurses would hold the phone up for her to hear when I called and I could hear her breathing). He's never called her in at least 20 years.  Then he'd immediately start asking me about her finances, her house, will, etc. \n\nSeveral family members on her side, siblings of hers, including his godfather, all people that always asked about him, adored him growing up have passed away, he would just say, \"so?\"\n\nSo yes, I can't even imagine the pain, of losing a child that's still alive, but thinks of you as dead to them. But you need to just get therapy to help you deal with the loss.", "\u2026.but\u2026 she was *polite* in her message to the son\u2026 so that makes her behaviour ok.  Right?!  /s", "You're forgetting about half there in your \"you can't judge\", the part where a child to a parent who had no other choice than to do the \"cutting off\".\n\nIs anyone under the impression that you ultimately go NC for shits and giggles? \n\nApparently OPs son hit his breaking point and decided that his choice of path was best for him. He is 100% allowed to think about himself first.", "Also, i find it funny that OP says she can \u201cpolitely\u201d ask a ten year old boy to please pass along the message that his stepdad is ungrateful and unappreciative of his mother who raised him and to please ask stepdad to call back", "My parents are exactly the same. Posted on facebook \"my daughter diappeared for no reason, I was  a loving grandmother blah blah blah.\" She forgot to mention the physical, sexual and emotional abuse. The many letters and conversations I've had with her that I need them to stop calling me names and using sexist, racist, homophobic and ableist slurs in front of my children", "The \"missing missing reasons\" strikes again.", "Lol - the little girls are two.  All I can  say is she is a piece of work.", "That\u2019s unfortunately not necessarily true. There are places that can enforce GPR even with no prior relationship (NY state is one I know off the top of my head).", ">I just want to meet my grandchildren\n\nNot that you want to work on the relationship with your son. Not that you recognize ways you may have overstepped or not stepped up and hope to make amends. Not that you heard he's struggling and are offering to assist him - no strings attached. Nope. You just want to get at the grandkids. He's cut you off so you're hoping to replace him with the newer models?\n\nHow delusional do you have to be to think someone who wants nothing to do with you is going to allow you access to his children? You don't get to spend time with children when you can't respect and get along with their parents.", "You uh, you know that publicly shaming your son and calling him ungrateful already proves you HAVENT \u201cbeen nothing but good to him,\u201d right? Get a grip, because just giving birth to him ISNT enough.", "Why? what is it with you people? you had your kids you had your chance to have a good relationship a grandbaby is not \"a new chance\" and not your supportanimal.", "You ARE pushing too hard. You contacted a 10 yo you've never even met to get a response.\n\n>I haven't done anything to him.\n\nExcept apparently threatening him and his wife to sue for \"grandparent rights\" or wtf of HIS kids.\n\n You're literally here and now trying to trash talk him and smear his name with \"he can't provide\" \"keeps a dirty place\" which you have no proof of. That's NOT being good to him. You're clearly trying to build an image of your son that you think is gonna help you force visit his kids.\n\nAnd just because you may share an iota of DNA with his kids doesn't give you any right whatsoever to meet or talk to them if he and his wife say no. No is a full sentence. And that they're considering getting a restraining order against you says it all. Leave them alone.\n\nYTA", "He made it pretty clear that you need to back off. Him having to say that means you already pushed too hard. It sounds to make you are likely the source of his struggles.", "\"as far as I'm concerned\"\n\nThat's the problem right there.", "You're a narcissist who thinks you can do no wrong. You're obviously a horribly abusive person and now that you've been given what you deserve, you're trying to play the victim. Leave him and his family alone.

Your son has made it clear he wants nothing to do with you, and will even resort to using the law to enforce this. \n\nYou need to leave them alone. Messaging a child is a totally inappropriate response.", "That comment about his home will come full circle one day when you end up in a dirty nursing home. \n\nThen you can tell the staff all about how you were nothing but good to your son, because no one is going to visit you.", "Of course you don't think you've done anything to him and have been nothing but good to him. People like you always think like that.\n\nI hope he gets the restraining order. What where you thinking involving a 10 year old you've never met?", "Not usually when the parents are still together.  That\u2019s usually in cases of a death or divorce.", "I wanted to post this link, too.\n\nRead this website, OP. Yours is a textbook case.", "Let\u2019s not forget she threatened to take them to court for grandparent rights. Mom of the year right there.", "NY GPR laws are super fucked up.", "Sounds like it"]}
