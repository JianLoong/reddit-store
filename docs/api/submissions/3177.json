Today, I posted to my Facebook and made a post regarding my son not speaking to me, I called him ungrateful and told him that he is very unappreciative for anything I\u2019ve done for him as I raised him as a single mother throughout my life and even allowed him to live under my roof into his adulthood. His wife, 25F has a son, 10M that she does not share with my son, but her son does have a social media and since I have been unable to get through to he or his wife that i have not met as of yet, i reached out to her son, and politely asked that he pass the message to my son or his mother. \n\n My son finally messaged me back, told me that i ruined his life and asked me to leave he and his family alone. He threatened to file a restraining order if u contacted them again and I told him that I don\u2019t feel I should stop because a mothers love doesn\u2019t end and I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation especially with it being the holidays.

Leave him alone, and do not drag a literal child into your disagreement with your son.", "Wow, YTA completely. Involving a 10 year old you've never even met? Take the hint, you screwed up up so badly your kid wants nothing to do with you, leave them alone and get a truckload of therapy", "YTA - You obviously did something - no one goes NC for no reason at all.  And what grandparents rights do you think you have?  You have never met the 2 year olds, and the older one has nothing to do with you at all.   There is no relationship for you to claim any rights over.\n\nWhilst a 10 year old shouldn't be on facebook, you had no business contacting him - he is a child and has nothing to do with your problems.\n\nThere is clearly a big chunk of this story missing - specifically what happened with your 'then husband', and what did you do (or not do) about it?", "YTA - Missing reasons galore. Leave this dude alone, he doesn't want you in his life.", "If calling him \u201cungrateful\u201d doesn\u2019t make him see the error of his ways, then nothing will. And reaching out to a 10y/o child that you\u2019ve never met and asking him to express your criticisms to his stepfather is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  Congratulations you are a stalker and YTA.", "YTA. First off, you leave children alone. It is absolutely unacceptable to contact a *ten year old* for something like this.\n\nSecond off, I think you *do* understand why your son has gone this level of no contact with you. You just also think you should be able to stomp all over his boundaries and treat him however you want and he should be happy and grateful for it.", "YTA. Using your Facebook to complain and call your son ungrateful is not you reaching out to him for the holidays. You should also leave your son's stepchild alone. You're not doing any of this in good faith. You should be sending messages to your son to ask him to get in touch. \n\nYou need to stop, OP. If you really love and respect your son, you will respect his wishes or you will deal with the consequences your son has set out. I really would like to know what you thought the response would be here when you're calling him ungrateful, but honestly, it doesn't matter. \n\nAccept what has happened and find a way to enjoy the holiday season.", "YTA\n\n\nYou contacted a child?\n\n\nYou have no idea what happened?\n\n\nYou are so out of line.", "YTA. You involved a 10-year-old kid? Yeah, with behavior like that, good luck with the whole grandparents rights thing.\n\nI don\u2019t for one moment believe this is about your \u201clove\u201d for him. What you are doing isn\u2019t love. It\u2019s harassment. I also don\u2019t believe that this is anywhere near the entire story.", "YTA, your behavior is narcissistic and it also definitely sounds like you are leaving out large parts of the story.", "YTA\n\n\n>my son seems to see things differently but refuses to tell me the reasons as to what I have done\n\nIt sounds you understand he has a different perspective on you shared history, so he clearly **has** spoken to you about it. I can't help wondering if he has told you his reasons for going no contact, and you just don't accept them as valid. Thereforeypu believe  he has no excuses for cutting you off. Google \"the missing missing reasons\" and see if this rings any bells.\n\n>Today, I posted to my Facebook and made a post regarding my son not speaking to me, I called him ungrateful and told him that he is very unappreciative\n\nAntagonizing the people you want to be close to in a public forum is rarely successful. It also makes you look attention-hingry and un-selfaware.\n\n>since I have been unable to get through to he or his wife that i have not met as of yet, i reached out to her son\n\nHarassing a 10 year old on social media is almost guaranteed to get an angry response from he carers.\n\n>I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation especially with it being the holidays.\n\nLook, it doesn't matter if you think his explanations and actions are reasonable or not. He holds all the power here. If you ever want to have any kind of contact, you have to accept that you have to do things his way, humble yourself, apologise and abide by his boundaries. \n\nBased on what you have written here, it seems you are only concerned about your feelings, your rights, and your wants. To re-establish a civil relationship, you are going to need to prioritise your son and honour his feelings, rights and needs. \n\nDo you want a connection, or do you want to be Right? Choose carefully.", "YTA - Respect his wishes. He wants to cut all contact and doesn\u2019t want you reaching out. You can love him from afar. He doesn\u2019t owe you access to him or his children. If there\u2019s ever a chance that he wants a relationship with you in the future, you need to respect his wishes. Forcing yourself on him is only going to do further damage.", "YTA - your behaviour is so offside. \n\n1- posting publicly on Facebook talking crap about your son for everyone to see\n\n2- contacting a 10 year old child on Facebook is beyond out of line to do \n\n3- threatening your son you\u2019re going to take him to court\n\nThis behaviour is so offside, so unacceptable. This type of behaviour will continue to push your son away. \n\nYou need to seek therapy and stop attempting to contact him. Absolutely DO NOT contact his wife or child either.\n\nEdited to add just because you raised a child, you are not entitled to anything from them when you treat them horribly. That\u2019s all. Hope you get help for your issues.", "YTA. This just screams of missing missing reasons and denial of needing to take personal responsibility. You saying your son wouldn't tell you what was so bad he went NC means either he did and you don't want to admit it or that it was so bad he couldn't talk about it, both indications of failure on your part.\n\nYou're also the AH for involving a child, an innocent you have no relation too by blood or emotion. The relationship you had, past tense, evolved from mother and child to that between adults, and you don't seem to have understood that. Relationships are two way with mutual respect, you only talk about what you want while criticising your son for denying you this, it's neither two way nor mutually respectful. Your actions, past and present, have cost you a future with the boy you raised. If you pursue legal action it will make something already bad far worse.", "YTA  \nIf your post was about calling him ungrateful, how do you think he will suddenly talk to you? You realised you made a mistake and now you do not want to face the consequences but the mistakes of the past will always come to bite you back.", "YTA, obviously\nWhat part of \"no contact\" do you not understand? Also, pretty sure you don't get \"grandparents' rights\" when you've never met the grandchildren...", "Your son's made it repeatedly clear that he doesn't want anything to do with you.   If he changes his mind, I'm sure that you'll be the first to find out, but, until then, leave him in peace.\n\nYTA", "Girl! Leave him alone !!!!!!

Bottom line, your son wants nothing to do with you and you have no right to force a relationship on him or his son.  Whatever happened between you and your now Ex your conduct, ignoring your son's wishes and threatening court action, supports his position far better than yours.", "When restraining orders break out then someone is pushing too hard, sorry lady, you gotta lay off and hope he gets over whatever it is and stops by sometime.\n\nOn a side note, if ya can't get in touch with him the normal way never make an end run to get there, it only pisses them off more. Best of luck.", "YTA, he doesn\u2019t want to have contact with you and you should respect that. you also made a public facebook post shaming him of course he isn\u2019t going to want to speak with you. don\u2019t reach out to a 10 year old you have never met, just leave them alone.", "YTA   If you can\u2019t accept responsibility for anything you\u2019ve done to him, shit that\u2019s so severe he\u2019s gone NC, you dont deserve him as a son and you definitely don\u2019t deserve to be a grandparent. You have 0 rights to those children. Also contacting his step son?? What is wrong with you???? The audacity radiating off you can be felt all the way over here", "Hard YTA. He clearly wants no contact with you, and you think the best way to make amends is by publicly blasting him on social media, then contacting a child with no relationship with him? You also clearly have no idea what grandparents' rights are.", "YTA. There are obviously reasons your son doesn\u2019t want to be involved with you. Not mention, contacting a 10 year old child not even related to you to do your dirty work is certifiable. Maybe do some actual reflection on your parenting to figure out why you\u2019re here in this position. \n\nPS - Good luck getting grandparent rights. It\u2019s meant to preserve relationships already established between grandparents and grandchildren. Not to force one.", "YTA for dragging a 10 year old child into this. You knew your son was getting your messages and choosing not to respond, and instead of respecting his wishes, you harrassed his 10 year old stepson in order to drag a response out of him. And I find it very hard to believe that he never told you why he cut you off.", "YTA. The Facebook post was manipulative and you posted it to get others to gang up on your son and they tell him what a terrible son he is. \n\nBecause of this, why are you so surprised by his reaction? If this post is an indication of how you treat your son, I can\u2019t imagine what else you put him through. Especially for him to completely cut you out of communication.\n\nAlso, you post here, is missing details and is too broad for the story (and it is a story) you  are trying to sell to Reddit for sympathy.", "YTA. You haven\u2019t listened to your son, you blasted him on social media, dragged his poor step son into this mess and are now threatening him\u2026? Did I get that right? \n\nI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a lot more to the story too\u2026", ">I don\u2019t deserve to be cut off this way for no reasonable explanation\n\nINFO what's the unreasonable explanation your son gave you?", "INFO - You posted something private on Facebook, publicly? Not OK in any circumstance. There's something about the way you treat your son that you aren't admitting.", "oh, wow....I'm betting I can guess WHY your son went NC with you.\n\nYour 'explanation' of what you did/didn't do along with reaching out to A TEN YEAR OLD CHILD via facebook WTF are you thinking woman?!?!  Bashing your son on your facebook then telling him that you will sue HIM for grandparent rights?!?! OMG...just...wow.  Save your money, you won't win that battle. I'm betting your son has plenty of examples of why you shouldn't be allowed visitation with his children. \n\nYou just shown how exactly NOT to go about trying to reconcile with someone. You must have some inkling about what you did or how you upset your son - I'm sure he told you many times in the past and you chose to ignore and dismiss his feelings.", "YTA - grandparents rights lol there really is no such thing.  You threatened to sue your son.  He cut you out.  You aren\u2019t owed anything.", "YTA. He\u2019s probably told you multiple times why he wants nothing to do with you and you either ignored it because you didn\u2019t want to hear it or didn\u2019t think it was bad enough to warrant cutting off contact. Leave him alone. You proved to him that he was right to cut you off by ranting about him on Facebook (likely in a public post) and contacting his 10 year-old stepson.", "YTA so he just cut you off with no explanation or was it that he gave you one and you just can\u2019t accept it. The fact that it\u2019s been 5 years and he\u2019s threatening a restraining order tells me it\u2019s much more to the story than what you\u2019re sharing. Also, threatening him with grandparent rights is a sure fire way to make sure that this relationship will be permanently damaged. Just leave him alone.", "YTA. Oof I love it when parents do this and can't understand why they've been cut off because clearly you can see why....you were cut off because you didn't support your son. Instead you chose to believe your husband over him.

What do you want? A pay on the back for raising the child you had? Apparently you didn\u2019t do a very good job if you son wants nothing to do with you. Good luck taking him to court for grandparent rights. You\u2019ll be wasting your money since you clearly don\u2019t understand what grandparents rights really are.", "YTA.\n\nYou want to know what a parent's job is? A parent's job is to raise functioning, happy adults. Your children do not owe you happiness.\n\nHow dare you try to put a child in the middle? Why would you write a post about how your child hurt you or how disappointed you are? He is so disappointed with you he went no contact.\n\nLeave him alone. You have no right to be a part of his life and he has made his decision. \n\nBe enough of a mom to respect it.", "YTA:\n\nCan you say stalker bringing an innocent 10 year old into this? Leave them alone and if or when your son wants to read out he will! Being the way you are is only going to alienate them more and get the police involved.", "You do realize you have shown everyone here why your son wants nothing to do with your narcissistic self.

I mean don't reach out to a 10 year, that's obvious on the internet, but I'm really curious and can't pass judgement without know what happened. Did you two fight? Did you not fight for him? Was he a rebellious teen?

Leave him to live his life", "YTA how can you talk about the love of a mother while you're being insulting him? You play the victim and you publicly attack him on social medias saying he was ungrateful because you allowed him to live in your house after is 18th birthday and putting a minor in the middle of all this, sending him messages.

He has made it clear he doesn\u2019t want contact! You crossed so many lines, making a public post that in and of itself is worth cutting ties, than reaching out to a child you don\u2019t know. Back off! You are doing all the worst things.", "Reaching out to him would not make you an AH. However, YTA because you didn\u2019t just do that, sincerely, but also posted to Facebook, haven\u2019t reflected on what you probably did, and worst of all *contacted an uninvolved child about your drama*. \n\nReaching out privately to your son himself, and no one else/not publicly, is one thing. What you\u2019ve done is beyond that and demonstrates more selfishness to him than remorse and a genuine desire to reconnect, even if that wasn\u2019t your intention.", "YTA, when your adult child tells you they don't want you to contact them or be in their life, your only job as a parent is to respect that.\n\nIf you don't, then you're making it about you. Part of raising children is letting them go if they want to be gone. Don't keep pestering them, you could be doing far more harm than you can ever imagine.\n\nStop being so selfish and let your son go, leave him alone.\n\nEdited due to your/you're/yore confusion.", "Please read your post and then try to explain to us how you aren\u2019t TA - you are the very definition of TA.", "YTA -- Okay, sooooo I read the words \"a mother's love doesn't end\" followed by \"I threatened to take him to court for grandparent rights.\"   You want to bridge this gap between you and your son by hurling insults at him? Calling him ungrateful.  OP, can you see the incongruency here? \n\nA mother's love means she wants to see her child live their best life, find their happiness.  I am sorry you are estranged and I know it hurts you but forcing yourself into his life, tracking down a child to play middleman for you....these are not qualities of someone seeking to restore a healthly relationship with their child.\n\nDo a little soul searching.  Think about your role in this situation because, he hasn't turned his back on you \"just because.\"  There are reasons why you both are in this place and you need to address what those reasons might be before trying to force yourself back into his life.", "YTA. i highly look up a post called the missing missing reasons.", "YTA. The reality is that *it doesn\u2019t matter* if you were in the wrong or not. Your son is an adult and he gets to choose who is a part of his life.", "YTA. You just reinforced every reason he has for staying away from you. WTH would he want to expose himself to that??  His house, his family, his rules. You are not entitled to a relationship with any of them. \n\nIf you want to get along with your son, my advice is to apologize - and that means no BUT BUT BUTs - and let him know you will LISTEN if he wants to talk about your issues - and that means you LISTEN to him, with YOUR mouth shut while he does it  Then leave it alone until and if he is ready to do this. Family counseling would not be a bad idea.\n\nYou may have burned that bridge, a d it is your fault if you did, for not respecting his adulthood and his boundaries for HIS family.", "Info: what does your son say you did?", "Also, I'm willing to bet money that her son has absolutely told her what she and her husband did, and she just didn't want to upset her happy marriage and chose to ignore it at the expense of her son. You don't have that level of anger followed by no contact without an actual reason for it. OP is absolutely leaving out most of the relevant information to make herself look better. YTA.", "And OP has no grandparents rights. Her grandchildren have no relationship with her. They probably do not know she exists.", "It's been 5 years op has deluded themselves into thinking nothing happened", "Agree. Calling him out on fb was a horrible thing to do. And leave the poor step Child out of it.", "\\^well said", "Im not pushing too hard, I haven\u2019t done anything to him. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he is struggling financially as my family tells me, he is struggling to provide for them, keeps a dirty place. I have been nothing but good to him I just want to meet my grandchildren", "Yeah. Lots of missing reasons. Also contacting the stepson was bad enough but threatening to sue for grandparents rights. YTA.", "Grandparents rights is a thing in some states. It's taken quite seriously in NY. But it's not a weapon that toxic cut off granny's can use to force their children to allow them to meet their grandkids.", "I\u2019m estranged from my dad and I\u2019d put my money on the same. We always have the conversations with them in hopes they\u2019ll see the light, and we finally walk away when it becomes clear they\u2019re too selfish to care about anyone but themselves. Op is YTA and I hope her son and his family are happy without her.", "It\u2019s the old [missing missing reasons](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html)", ">I haven\u2019t done anything to him.\n\nThe restraining order threat would suggest otherwise.", "You literally started writing to a 10 y.o. you have never met before just to reach t him. Yep, that's harassment. He clearly doesn't want you to meet his children, well, it is what it is.", "You\u2019re straight up harassing your sons family. You messaged a 10 year old boy you\u2019ve never met. How uncomfortable for him. \n\nYour son has made it very clear he wants nothing to do with you, and you need to accept that. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve ever tried to apologize or understand your wrong doings either.", "Your defensiveness and refusal to acknowledge the problems your son had with your ex say otherwise. You're not entitled to meeting your grandchildren, especially if you're not willing to repair your relationship with your son and would instead resort to airing your dirty laundry on Facebook, calling him ungrateful.", "What does the state of his home or his earnings have to do with anything?  You sound a bit judgy.........I'm starting to see why he doesn't speak to you....", "You haven\u2019t done anything? You\u2019ve got a bunch of flying monkeys who spy on your son and report back to you. You messaged a child and attempted to drag this little boy into your adult drama. You insulted your son on social media. You threatened to sue him for grandparent rights. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t have a good reason to go NC before, he certainly has one now. I would end all contact with anyone who threaten to come after my children. I have no doubt you\u2019re reaping what you\u2019ve sown. YTA", "If you want to find somebody who agrees with you, it looks like you are going to have to go somewhere else.  Every comment here is against you.  Including this one.\n\nYTA.", "You don't have a kind word to say about him, and plead ignorant on why he left you home and your life. Why is your ex, the guy who drove your son out, your ex anyway?", "You\u2019re not entitled to a relationship with your grandkids. Also you\u2019re getting all of your information second hand. Regardless of what\u2019s going on with him if he wanted you to know he would directly tell you.", "\"You've done nothing\"? It seems exactly that what he resents about you. If I were to guess, you didn't protect him from your former partner, at least. Sometimes \"not taking sides\" is a form of neglect, specially when it comes to children.\n\nAs I said, you don't even acknowledge you may have done something wrong. And you're not trying to make amends, you're just demanding love.", "\"I haven't done anything to him\"\n\nIf you didn't do anything this wouldn't be happening and he wouldn't want to slap a restraining order on you.\n\nMy suggestion is for you to take a long hard look at your behavior, acknowledge what you did and apologize. \n\nNo buts & no excuses for your behavior. I am talking real reflection and ownership of your behavior. Even then it will be up to him to forgive you but you won't have a ghost of a chance until you do this.", "He wants you out of his life. You are absolutely delusional. YTA.", "Exactly, don't know about all states, but in KS, the grandkids have to have actually met the grandparents for them to have rights, so I can't yhink this woman has much to stand on.", "Right?! This lady sounds like my mother....who I cut contact with In every way two years ago....it\u2019s amazing how these psychos think, isn\u2019t it?", "Narcissism is a hell of a drug."]}
