My husband was going out with our middle daughter for the night, but before he left, I asked him to bring up the box of new Halloween decorations I had purchased. He did, no problem. My daughter and I spent about 20-30 minutes just decorating the mantel. \nWhen he came home that night, I was in bed with our youngest. He walked in the door and yelled \u201cWhat the hell is going on here!?\u201d He was beyond upset over our decorating. He came upstairs and said I didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d him if I could put up the decorations, and didn\u2019t include him. He also said he had no idea I was going to be doing this, even though he brought the decorations up for me. I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is. Yeah, I get it - It\u2019s July and most people don\u2019t decorate for Halloween this early. But who cares? Halloween is my favorite holiday, seeing it up makes me happy and helps with my depression. On top of that, I\u2019m going in for surgery in August, and I won\u2019t be allowed to do much for at least 6 weeks after. \nSo am I the ass hole?", "created_utc": 1689439689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150gsp4/aita_for_putting_up_halloween_decorations_in_july/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s not really cool. Especially because (and don\u2019t get me wrong, I love halloween too) holiday decor has a tendency to look cheap or weird and is generally not very aesthetically appealing.

My wife has a rule that we aren't allowed to decorate until after Thanksgiving (which means we decorate the day after Thanksgiving). One year, we decided to surprise her by decorating the day after Halloween. When she pulled in, we blared Christmas music. You know what she did?

There are so many things going on in the world to be upset over, Halloween decor in July is NOT one of them.", "Yet another reason why we can't judge by titles.

It\u2019s definitely not normal to be decorating for a holiday that is over 3 months away. That being said, considering you\u2019ll be recovering from surgery during the main decoration period, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong, I just think you could have communicated better.

No, just wanted to get something up.", "Christmas magic \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "And this affects your life how?\n\nLet people enjoy their things when they're not hurting anyone. I always watch a fuckton of hallmark Christmas movies every year. What of it.", "She wrote elsewhere in the thread that this is just the start and she has plans to decorate other stuff too...", "I wouldn\u2019t flip - you do you - but I love Christmas so much, and one of the reasons is that it feels special. If you have them up too long, it loses the specialness.", "Same, purple LEDs on my (ethical) skull collection, a chain of jawbones hanging from a lamp, a faux bat skeleton, coffin shaped area rug, coffin shaped shelves, skull planter, skull themed goblet, my entire living room is basically a shrine to the macabre. And other than dusting, i don't ever put it away, i just rearrange to keep it clean and tidy.", "But he lives in the house too. It should be a shared decision. Or at least a discussion.", "Oh I need that setup, seasonal skeletons sounds like fun!", "Now that you mention it certain Christians have a huge problem with Halloween. Of course that\u2019s bigoted toward Pagans. Maybe I\u2019ll put some up.", "I find seasonal decor outside of its season to be often controversial or unusual", "And she\u2019s an adult who can get over not having it? Did you even think for one second before hitting post?", "I was thinking about that too, maybe it's their tradition to decorate together as a family and he felt left out (maybe for his other children as well). OP did say that the husband said something like \"you didn't include me\".", "seconded that there's stuff left out. ESH also as someone with deprsssion, \"it helps with my depression\" isn't an excuse to make unilateral decisions(although it's pretty innocent here). also did the kid have the idea to decorate or was it OP?", "op\u2019s planning to do a lot more, per their comments. i feel like a lot of the comments are missing a point, talking about how they love holiday decor or have it up right now. holiday decor is not the point. unilaterally making changes to a shared space is the point. that said, op asked him to bring it to then so he should have been able to guess what would happen, and his reaction was extremely ott. esh imo.", "Crazy upset? How did you get that?", "See I wasn\u2019t going to give you a judgment, but now? Jesus.", "Brilliant", "He can get over having early spooky season decorations.", "You sound very controlling. If it was important to my partner to decorate, I\u2019d be fine with it. Why does it matter?", "Mr B has quite a following in the neighborhood.", "Maybe for you. But if it makes someone happy what is the deal", "There are TOWNS built just for seasonal holidays. What? Bet you visited at least one outside of the given season", "Are you the husband by chance? You are taking this quite personal.", "Not you, the husband. Also, I'm not even a big Halloween person but who cares if someone has early decorations? I've seen people have Christmas lights up year round. It doesn't really matter much in the grand scheme of things", "Your comment literally had nothing to do with the post whatsoever. Other than the fact that you wanted to say something sarcastic and judgemental. And I know this because we smell our own. You just kinda suck at it.", "Right? Two weeks of a difference, call the police! /s", "If she normally puts things up in August, and has been doing this since before they had kids, it's literally just a difference in putting them up two weeks earlier. I don't see why that's so bad?", "Because it makes the other person unhappy and the other person matters too. When you have holiday decor up for longer than a month it's just background clutter and loses all its charm. It ruins the entire vibes of the holiday bc you become immune to it.", "You asked what was controversial - it is controversial to put up holiday decorations over a month before they are relevant. OP is putting them up *three months* before the relevant, without consulting with or inviting their SO to participate. Not everyone loves early decor and no one likes feeling excluded.", "OP didn\u2019t mention living in Halloweentown. \n\nI have nothing against early holiday celebrations - we start decorating for Christmas very early! But that\u2019s because my partner and I actually like and respect each other and agree on how to decorate our house - ymmv.", "Lmao what??", "She responded to the top comment by saying there is a lot more to do. I take it that she's implying shes wants to continue decorating much more than the mantel. \n\nDecorations inherently don't physically harm anyone and when you have a shared living space I think you do need to kind of compromise or at least have a consensus on this topic. It's like me being a baseball fan and you being a Harry Potter fan, neither one person gets dibs to decorate the house like their personal bedroom in shared spaces and enforce that decision. Plus you have to take into context that they're seasonal decorations. \n\nIf you have a house you live and pay for alone by all means have Santa out in full display, tinsel lined banisters, elves on shelves, a tree in the living room. Also understand that's not really normal and not fair to impose that on others you live with. I think this is getting a pass bc loving Halloween is seen as culturally acceptable in younger generations, a genre that we're putting on a pedestal bc it's parallels to goth culture, cool creepy things, weird absurdities, off beatness is praised, its almost even a desired trait among people when dating. Swap Halloween with Christmas and people might be changing their tune, considering almost everyone but corporate execs whine and moan incessantly about seeing Christmas decorations the day after Halloween in stores.", "Agreed. He over reacted. But after reading a few reactions to me from the OP I think it may be a family trait.", "Fine. YTA. For being thin skinned about posts you asked for by coming on Reddit asking. Then insulting people if you don\u2019t get the response you wanted.", "Because instead of discussing it with her husband and having a heart to heart explaining her concerns with the surgery and any depression she may be feeling; she is asking internet strangers to assuage her of any wrong doing.\n\nThis isn't a funny, quirky thing; this is a cry for help, and she is crying in the wrong direction.", "It\u2019s on the mantle. I could see if there was a Halloween tree put up. Or maybe a 8ft animated grim reaper in the corner, or an 8ft spider. But it\u2019s on the mantle. I have a signed football on my mantle, I also have some Star Wars things. It\u2019s not how I would decorate my living room. In fact it looks very out of place, and it\u2019s not my favorite thing. My husband put them up, he didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d me, he did it. It brings him happiness to look at those things, I want him to be happy. And honestly if that is the biggest thing I have to stress over, my life is great at the moment. \n\nSo dad can look at it as decor.", "YMMV exactly. Decorations are no different from the outfit you put on. Do you ask your partner what outfit you should wear everyday? OP is allowed a YMMV moment especially since it brought joy", "I mean... Ngl you kind of asked for sarcasm if you posted something sarcastic first. It's really not that deep, it's just the internet", "But he can communicate too. He came home and decided to yell at his wife in their kids room while said kid was asleep. He could have brought it up alone with her calmly when they were alone, that's normal healthy communication in a relationship. He hasn't even explained why it matters so much to him, just that she didn't ask first.\n\nI don't see why everyone is jumping to conclusions about what he thinks when he hasn't even explained how he feels.", "It\u2019s a holiday decor three months in advance (controversial) that not everyone in the house was invited to partake in (also controversial).\n\nMy personal verdict of ESH stands, and I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t live with you since you seem to  not care about the mental health of your co-habitants.", "Decorations are absolutely different than your outfit.\n\nSo if it makes her happy she should be able to do it? If it brings him joy to box it all up and put up a live laugh love sign instead he should do that?", "But it is helping the original posters Mental health. So that should also count. \n\nAnd I am living with someone already. Actually married to him have been for over a quarter of a century so I guess I\u2019m doing something right.", "Sounds like you could use a bit more joy in your life", "Both people\u2019s mental health are of equal importance here - why does \u201cit makes me happy\u201d give OP the right to proceed without discussing it with their SO, who was hurt by the decision?", "I could! But I don\u2019t want to be an asshole like OP in order to get it, so what can ya do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Based on my personal experience and the experience in my household. When I ask my husband to get the boxes of Halloween things down, Thanksgiving, Easter.fall etc that is a sign I\u2019m putting something out."]}
