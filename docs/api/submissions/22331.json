My husband was going out with our middle daughter for the night, but before he left, I asked him to bring up the box of new Halloween decorations I had purchased. He did, no problem. My daughter and I spent about 20-30 minutes just decorating the mantel. \nWhen he came home that night, I was in bed with our youngest. He walked in the door and yelled \u201cWhat the hell is going on here!?\u201d He was beyond upset over our decorating. He came upstairs and said I didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d him if I could put up the decorations, and didn\u2019t include him. He also said he had no idea I was going to be doing this, even though he brought the decorations up for me. I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is. Yeah, I get it - It\u2019s July and most people don\u2019t decorate for Halloween this early. But who cares? Halloween is my favorite holiday, seeing it up makes me happy and helps with my depression. On top of that, I\u2019m going in for surgery in August, and I won\u2019t be allowed to do much for at least 6 weeks after. \nSo am I the ass hole?\n\nETA - I want to add some stuff that people have specifically asked about. \n\nWe don't have a tradition of putting up Halloween decorations. When I was a SAHM I would always decorate the inside alone for Halloween. The outside we always did/do together because I needed his strength to get some of the things stuck into the dirt.\nI would never use any type of Mental Health as an excuse for anything, and I honestly don't appreciate the accusations. I was frankly stating a fact. It makes me smile to sit down and see decorations. Like I'm in my happy place. And when the Christmas decorations are up, I'll feel the same way.", "created_utc": 1689439689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150gsp4/aita_for_putting_up_halloween_decorations_in_july/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s not really cool. Especially because (and don\u2019t get me wrong, I love halloween too) holiday decor has a tendency to look cheap or weird and is generally not very aesthetically appealing.

My wife hates Christmas decorations, my kids and I love them. I have a ton and a very small house, so it always looks like Santa vomited everywhere. My wife has a rule that we aren't allowed to decorate until after Thanksgiving (which means we decorate the day after Thanksgiving). One year, we decided to surprise her by decorating the day after Halloween. When she pulled in, we blared Christmas music. You know what she did? She walked in, walked right back out (lol) and then came in laughing. The whole thing backfired because after two months, I was so ready to have my home back to its natural state.

There are so many things going on in the world to be upset over, Halloween decor in July is NOT one of them.", "Yet another reason why we can't judge by titles. I assumed you were putting up decorations all over the front yard which would be a potential Y-T-A but just doing the mantle? NTA.", "NTA. Is it a little odd? Sure, but it's harmless. You and your daughter bonded over putting decorations up (which can easily be taken down again), so what's the big deal?", "People will soon enough be putting up Christmas decorations.  I mean I know 2 people who keep Christmas trees up in their windows year round.  Just switch out the decorations every 6 weeks or so.\n\nSo you do you.

You decorated the mantel, big deal. Its July and really really hot in a lot of the country, October decorations could make it seem cooler. Why is this such a big deal.\n\nOne house down the street doesn't take decorations down after the holiday, they just add to the decorations for the next holiday. It is glorious and even the HOA doesn't  mind.\n\nSince you are depressed and going in for surgery everyone needs to lighten up and help you out.", "Right now maybe a NAH- \n1st. Y\u2019all suck with communication. If he is mad bc you didn\u2019t ask permission- then I amend it to he\u2019s the AH. If he is really mad bc you and your daughter did a fun activity at home while he\u2019s there - then you\u2019re the AH.

You do you! NTA", "NAH, personally I would have let SO know of my plans and not assumed they knew the plan based off the request. It\u2019s definitely not normal to be decorating for a holiday that is over 3 months away. That being said, considering you\u2019ll be recovering from surgery during the main decoration period, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong, I just think you could have communicated better. Not everyone wants to live in a festive space long term :)\n\nETA: not inviting my SO is a jerk move, and based off that I\u2019m inclined to make this a Y T A but overall I\u2019ll leave my vote as is because it appears your SO reacted disproportionately to the \u201ccrime\u201d so imo you even out", "YTA . Maybe he doesn't wanna look at Halloween decorations for 4 months. I can't stand when people decorate like this and don't ask their partners.", "It's way to early sure but what harm is a few decorations on the mantel?

We don't have enough INFO to guess what's happening here.\n\nBut N T A putting decorations up out of season. Maybe he loves July, or Halloween is his favorite so that's why he's mad.

It's like me being a baseball fan and you being a Harry Potter fan, neither one person gets dibs to decorate the house like their personal bedroom in shared spaces and enforce that decision. Plus you have to take into context that they're seasonal decorations. \n\nIf you have a house you live and pay for alone by all means have Santa out in full display, tinsel lined banisters, elves on shelves, a tree in the living room. Also understand that's not really normal and not fair to impose that on others you live with. I think this is getting a pass bc loving Halloween is seen as culturally acceptable in younger generations, a genre that we're putting on a pedestal bc it's parallels to goth culture, cool creepy things, weird absurdities, off beatness is praised, its almost even a desired trait among people when dating.
