{"id": 22331, "submission_id": "150gsp4", "title": "AITA for putting up Halloween decorations in July?", "selftext": "So last night, along with our youngest daughter (8) I decided to put up some Halloween decorations. My husband was going out with our middle daughter for the night, but before he left, I asked him to bring up the box of new Halloween decorations I had purchased. He did, no problem. My daughter and I spent about 20-30 minutes just decorating the mantel. \nWhen he came home that night, I was in bed with our youngest. He walked in the door and yelled \u201cWhat the hell is going on here!?\u201d He was beyond upset over our decorating. He came upstairs and said I didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d him if I could put up the decorations, and didn\u2019t include him. He also said he had no idea I was going to be doing this, even though he brought the decorations up for me. I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is. Yeah, I get it - It\u2019s July and most people don\u2019t decorate for Halloween this early. But who cares? Halloween is my favorite holiday, seeing it up makes me happy and helps with my depression. On top of that, I\u2019m going in for surgery in August, and I won\u2019t be allowed to do much for at least 6 weeks after. \nSo am I the ass hole?", "created_utc": 1689439689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150gsp4/aita_for_putting_up_halloween_decorations_in_july/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not a big deal.", "Well, aside from the fact that the decorations will have been up so long by the time Halloween comes around, they will have to be dusted\u2026 NTA\n\nWow, your husband is a buzzkill. I hope you get well soon.", "ESH. \n\nThat\u2019s a weird overreaction on your husband\u2019s part, but why on earth are you putting them up so early??\n\nIt may be your favorite holiday, but you\u2019re making a long term change to the shared home decor without consulting your partner. That\u2019s not really cool. Especially because (and don\u2019t get me wrong, I love halloween too) holiday decor has a tendency to look cheap or weird and is generally not very aesthetically appealing. Seeing it every day for 3 months may make you happy, but it may make him upset. You didn\u2019t consider his feelings. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to be yelling at you over this though. Just a simple \u201chey, I wasn\u2019t okay with 3 months of halloween decorations, can you take them back down?\u201d. \n\n\u2026 but then again now he looks like the bad guy to your kid if he says that. So you\u2019ve kind of put him in a tough place. This may be closer to a Y-T-A", "I have to state the obvious here OP, decorating in July for Halloween is bizarre. It's July! I would be looking at my husband sideways too if he did that. I understand you will have surgery in August but you could have asked him and your daughters to do it for you. I don't think this is normal behavior at all. Using depression as an excuse is cringe. Surly, there are other more stable ways to manage your depression. Just because something makes you happy does not mean you get to force your spouse to go along with it especially if it's something this strange.", "ESH. - he reacted badly but making a controversial decorating choice in your home should be discussed together. Now he\u2019s put in a bad spot cause the kid is attached to it so he\u2019s either the bad guy or has to look at shit he doesn\u2019t like for over 3 months.", "And happy Halloween!!", "NTA; my house has had Halloween decorations up since last Halloween and my bedroom has been Halloween Central since I moved into my current home 3 years ago. Halloween makes me happy.", "YTA no one commenting has read the story saying \"NTA decorating can happen before October\" thats not the issue your husband felt left out on a fun activity with your daughter. Yes there will be mors bu that doesn't mean he wont be hurt you didn't think to include him.", "NTA", "YTA I\u2019d be pissed if my partner decorated the house for any season, Christmas, hallowe\u2019en, Easter, months early and did not ask first. Decorations should go up a month early, you\u2019re doing it 2.5 months early and didn\u2019t check with anyone.", "NTA. Any date after the 4th of July is fair game.\n\nHell,  I've still got Halloween AND Christmas stuff up from 2020 forward because it makes me happy to see it. This includes one of those LED figures from THD and a candy cane on my front door", "Lmao hard NTA. We have a permanent Halloween display in our apartment. 365, 24/7!", "YTA- I\u2019d be annoyed of having Halloween decorations up in July out of nowhere too. It\u2019s also his house and he has to look at it all day, also it seems he was mostly upset about not being included. \n\nAnd what does you getting surgery in august matter for? Not sure how that correlates to anything at all.", " NTA. You asked to bring the box down and i would put money on there being a ton of context clues saying you are gping to decorate. You are an adult and dont have to ask his permission. If people can whip out xmas stuff in September then Halloween people can do it in July.", "That level aggression is a red flag. Does this happen often?", "YTA. Holiday decorating is a family event. You excluded your husband.", "Light yta. Look I get it. But this is your shared space and stuff like this should be agreed between you both. Like I would live to put up halloween in September. But Hubs isn't a fan. We came to the middle ground that fall decor can go up in September, but stuff that looks like halloween has to wait for Sept 30th.", "NTA at all! \n\nWhile it would have been nice to include your husband in all the fun (and next time I would suggest doing that), the answer to your actual question is no, you are not the AH, and there is nothing wrong with putting up spooky decorations any time of year. I have lots of friends whose homes are decorated like that year 'round, just because they love it so much! \n\nAnd frankly, they're only \"Halloween\" decorations if you're putting them up for the holiday. Otherwise they're just \"decorations\" and there's never a bad time to have fun decorating with your kids to make any day at all feel special!", "NTA seriously, who cares? My wife hates Christmas decorations, my kids and I love them. I have a ton and a very small house, so it always looks like Santa vomited everywhere. My wife has a rule that we aren't allowed to decorate until after Thanksgiving (which means we decorate the day after Thanksgiving). One year, we decided to surprise her by decorating the day after Halloween. When she pulled in, we blared Christmas music. You know what she did? She walked in, walked right back out (lol) and then came in laughing. The whole thing backfired because after two months, I was so ready to have my home back to its natural state. But the point is that it's not a big deal. I cannot imagine why your husband would be mad. That's absurd. There are so many things going on in the world to be upset over, Halloween decor in July is NOT one of them.", "Yet another reason why we can't judge by titles. I assumed you were putting up decorations all over the front yard which would be a potential Y-T-A but just doing the mantle? NTA.", "NTA. Is it a little odd? Sure, but it's harmless. You and your daughter bonded over putting decorations up (which can easily be taken down again), so what's the big deal?", "People will soon enough be putting up Christmas decorations.  I mean I know 2 people who keep Christmas trees up in their windows year round.  Just switch out the decorations every 6 weeks or so.\n\nSo you do you.  It's not like you put up skeletons in the front yard with Michael Myers in the window, \n\nNTA", "NTA. By the way, can I live near you? I want to help with the decorating.", "NTA. You decorated the mantel, big deal. Its July and really really hot in a lot of the country, October decorations could make it seem cooler. Why is this such a big deal.\n\nOne house down the street doesn't take decorations down after the holiday, they just add to the decorations for the next holiday. It is glorious and even the HOA doesn't  mind.\n\nSince you are depressed and going in for surgery everyone needs to lighten up and help you out.", "Right now maybe a NAH- \n1st. Y\u2019all suck with communication. If he is mad bc you didn\u2019t ask permission- then I amend it to he\u2019s the AH. If he is really mad bc you and your daughter did a fun activity at home while he\u2019s there - then you\u2019re the AH. But overall, your not an AH for putting up decorations about a week and 1/2 earlier than your normal, but he\u2019s not an AH for waiting to do a fun activity with his family", "If it makes you happy and isn't hurting anyone. You do you! NTA", "NAH, personally I would have let SO know of my plans and not assumed they knew the plan based off the request. It\u2019s definitely not normal to be decorating for a holiday that is over 3 months away. That being said, considering you\u2019ll be recovering from surgery during the main decoration period, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong, I just think you could have communicated better. Not everyone wants to live in a festive space long term :)\n\nETA: not inviting my SO is a jerk move, and based off that I\u2019m inclined to make this a Y T A but overall I\u2019ll leave my vote as is because it appears your SO reacted disproportionately to the \u201ccrime\u201d so imo you even out", "YTA . Maybe he doesn't wanna look at Halloween decorations for 4 months. I can't stand when people decorate like this and don't ask their partners.", "It's way to early sure but what harm is a few decorations on the mantel? NTA but this verdict is only on the assumption that if he'd asked politely for them to be taken down, they would have been or a compromise reached.", "Maybe ask him what the big deal is. We don't have enough INFO to guess what's happening here.\n\nBut N T A putting decorations up out of season. Maybe he loves July, or Halloween is his favorite so that's why he's mad. Or he hates Halloweeb. Who knows.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
