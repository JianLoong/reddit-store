He loves to party, get wasted and spend sundays sleeping while me and the girls just stay home. We have talked about this issue multiple times and he has promised to change, but hasn't. He would stay home a couple of weekends and then would go back and do exactly what he said wouldn't.\nI do not have an issue with him going out but getting home in the morning I feel is very disrespectful to me, my family and my home.\n\nLast night we had friends over, at around 10:30PM I decided to go to sleep with my daughters. At 03:00AM I get up to get some water and I notice that he is not home. I check my phone and he had texted me that he had went out with his friends and that he was on his way back.\n\nFast forward to 6:00AM, he still wasnt home and not responding calls or messages. I went from scared that something had happened to him, to mad that he was doing exactly what he always does so I proceeded to lock him out and asked him to not come home. He said (again) that he was on his way, but I did not open the door.\nNow I'm worried that I made things worse. Am I the Asshole or he deserves to learn his lesson?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for your comments, I know locking him out is not a solution, but I feel so angry and disrespected, especially because at the time he would have gotten home, my girls would have been up and would have seen him drunk/high. During the week he is very present, I work full time, while his job allows him to work part time, so he is the one taking the girls to school, teaching them sports and spending time with them. I think he is a good person, but not a good partner, I have thought about divorcing him but it breaks my heart for my girls not to have their father around. \n\nEdit 2: We live in the Caribbean so him passing out in the cold is not an issue, but still I know not letting him inside could have caused even more harm.\n\nEdit 3: he has has been home since 7:00AM, he got in thru a sliding window he forgot to lock before he left last night. He has been sleeping in our daughters room and hasn't come out, so I haven't seen him. I am thankful for your comments and I am aware he could have gotten hurt, I'm glad he did not and I regret what I did, but I feel he has been putting his life and other's in danger way before tonight. I am trying for my girls to have a fun, relaxed sunday but I am heartbroken for the position we are all in. I  suspect it could be more than drinking, I also know addiction is a disease but I do not have the tools to deal with every thing I have on my plate right now. While he is sleeping, my mind is racing, I am taking care of my girls and getting ready for work tomorrow.

My mom is from a small pacific island and weekend binge drinking is very problematic there, too. I\u2019ve got some \u201caunts\u201d (ladies in my extended family that I call \u201caunt\u201d) who would definitely empathize with what you\u2019re going through. My heart is with you, too. I hope and pray your husband agrees to get help.", ">He\u2019s going out until 6am\u2014that\u2019s a tad different than going to the movies. \n\n\nYeah, like I said. \n\n\n>And re the drinking metric if you don\u2019t like it what can I say, it\u2019s a guideline in my regional health authority. Like I said, most people didn\u2019t like the guideline when it came out, but it didn\u2019t stop the health authority from posting it (shrug).\n\n\nYeah, exactly: if it's greeted with a shrug, it's a woefully ineffective guideline \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Feel free to stop yourself.", "My wife also wished I wouldn't stay out late with friends once a week like that.  Well I stopped doing that and fast forward a couple years.... and it turns out it was one of the few \"me\" times I had left in my life and now I'm depressed and don't have friends.  I am now a dad / husband robot ... A shell of myself with suicidal ideation suppressed by meds to keep me working and bringing in money so as not to ruin my kids lives.  My wife now wishes I would go out and do things but it's too late now that ship has sailed.", "Your husband\u2019s bad tendencies remind me of my d*d. He would work very long hours and then stay out until 3-5 AM at bars drinking and doing god knows what. This would cause fights (for obvious reasons) between my parents. They tried to stay together for a while \u201cfor the kids\u201d but finally my mom kicked my dad out and god, it was like I could breathe. You feel guilty about divorcing him because of your daughters, but look at the chaos he brings into your life. No good dad acts like this. He is immature as well. I felt so relieved when my parents divorced because it meant we could have stability finally. You are young. I would give him the option of couples counseling. If that fails, just leave. You and your daughters need to be in a supportive, respectful, fulfilling home. He doesn\u2019t seem to be adding to  that. You need someone on your team.", "He\u2019s forty years old!!!! That is insane behavior. He needs help he might have some problems, drinking problems in particular. ESH if you don\u2019t hash this out and tell him he\u2019s not 21 anymore", "I say NTA \n\nAs having been married to an alcoholic and now divorced. You have to do extreme things like this because they won't respect your boundaries. \n\nObviously you would feel bad if something happened but they are a resilient species and only seem to harm others. Lol \n\nMaybe it's time to have a serious talk about his drinking habits and if maybe he has an addiction issue that needs to be addressed. If he is willing to get counseling and such, there may be less need to lock him out. \n\nYou did tell him not to come home. Next time tell him the doors will be locked. He can and probably does sleep some of it off at the friends houses. Which is why he's on his way home at 6am. So his safety really isn't a huge concern.", "Literally same! 100 agreed", "Exactly.  Some people need time away once a week for themselves with their friends.", ">  It's as if most just skipped the part where he takes them to school, teaches sports and spends time with them.\n\nThis is AITA, where someone is either perfect or terrible. There are no shades of grey.", "There are various definitions of an addict/alcoholic but it typically boils down to a simple fact: are you in control of your drinking or is it in control of you. In other words, what's running the show and can you stop when you want/need. \n\nSomeone who drinks every day isn't necessarily an alcoholic but someone who drinks once a month could be one."]}
