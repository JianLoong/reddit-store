He loves to party, get wasted and spend sundays sleeping while me and the girls just stay home. We have talked about this issue multiple times and he has promised to change, but hasn't. He would stay home a couple of weekends and then would go back and do exactly what he said wouldn't.\nI do not have an issue with him going out but getting home in the morning I feel is very disrespectful to me, my family and my home.\n\nLast night we had friends over, at around 10:30PM I decided to go to sleep with my daughters. At 03:00AM I get up to get some water and I notice that he is not home. I check my phone and he had texted me that he had went out with his friends and that he was on his way back.\n\nFast forward to 6:00AM, he still wasnt home and not responding calls or messages. I went from scared that something had happened to him, to mad that he was doing exactly what he always does so I proceeded to lock him out and asked him to not come home. He said (again) that he was on his way, but I did not open the door.\nNow I'm worried that I made things worse. Am I the Asshole or he deserves to learn his lesson?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for your comments, I know locking him out is not a solution, but I feel so angry and disrespected, especially because at the time he would have gotten home, my girls would have been up and would have seen him drunk/high. During the week he is very present, I work full time, while his job allows him to work part time, so he is the one taking the girls to school, teaching them sports and spending time with them. I think he is a good person, but not a good partner, I have thought about divorcing him but it breaks my heart for my girls not to have their father around. \n\nEdit 2: We live in the Caribbean so him passing out in the cold is not an issue, but still I know not letting him inside could have caused even more harm.", "created_utc": 1690110951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157c79e/aita_for_purposedly_locking_my_husband_out_of_the/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s a binge drinker, which is alcoholism and is a massive problem. \n\nYou are a little bit the AH for trying to teach him a lesson rather than putting your foot down on this entire situation.

Locking him out of his own home isn't a solution.\n\nMaybe you two can find some compromise where he can have a certain number of 'party nights' a month/quarter/year but only when he tells you when these nights will be IN ADVANCE, that he tells you where he will go, and that he agrees to either stay over with friends or get a hotel, or come home at a specific time (that he then sticks to). I feel that he should also be able to check his phone every now and then so that he isn't unreachable but you can agree to only contact him in case of emergencies.\n\nBanning him from socialising in a way that he clearly feels is important to him isn't going to work, but he is irresponsible and careless in how he is behaving right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can still go to a concert or go out drinking with friends but it has to be scheduled and in agreement with the other parent who will stay with the kids, and you should not drop off the face of the earth. Lots of people who are married or are in committed relationships (with kids) still do social things without their partner, especially if you have some of your own friends/friend groups and coworkers.
