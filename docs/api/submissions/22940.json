He loves to party, get wasted and spend sundays sleeping while me and the girls just stay home. We have talked about this issue multiple times and he has promised to change, but hasn't. He would stay home a couple of weekends and then would go back and do exactly what he said wouldn't.\nI do not have an issue with him going out but getting home in the morning I feel is very disrespectful to me, my family and my home.\n\nLast night we had friends over, at around 10:30PM I decided to go to sleep with my daughters. At 03:00AM I get up to get some water and I notice that he is not home. I check my phone and he had texted me that he had went out with his friends and that he was on his way back.\n\nFast forward to 6:00AM, he still wasnt home and not responding calls or messages. I went from scared that something had happened to him, to mad that he was doing exactly what he always does so I proceeded to lock him out and asked him to not come home. He said (again) that he was on his way, but I did not open the door.\nNow I'm worried that I made things worse. Am I the Asshole or he deserves to learn his lesson?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for your comments, I know locking him out is not a solution, but I feel so angry and disrespected, especially because at the time he would have gotten home, my girls would have been up and would have seen him drunk/high. During the week he is very present, I work full time, while his job allows him to work part time, so he is the one taking the girls to school, teaching them sports and spending time with them. I think he is a good person, but not a good partner, I have thought about divorcing him but it breaks my heart for my girls not to have their father around. \n\nEdit 2: We live in the Caribbean so him passing out in the cold is not an issue, but still I know not letting him inside could have caused even more harm.", "created_utc": 1690110951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157c79e/aita_for_purposedly_locking_my_husband_out_of_the/", "score": 470, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately sometimes kids will mirror behaviour of someone they love or respect, even if said behaviour is piss poor. \n\nSoft ESH, you're his partner and need to be honest with him about what's acceptable and what isn't, because this will eventually affect your kids, if it hasn't already.

From what I've seen I hate drinking and don't drink myself I'm 33 even when I was younger didn't like to drink.  You have to decide whether you want to fight to keep your family together or not and actually make it.  Talk with him and find a plan on action you set it kinda high but have reasonable person expectations like say he needs to go to 2 meetings a week but really one is good but it's putting that pressure that he has to do it or leave.
