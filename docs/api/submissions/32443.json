In and of itself definitely not a dealbreaker at 25, but I just wanted to let you know I dated a very similar person who was 12 years older than me at roughly the same age. He will not get better. My guy was exactly the same at 28 as he was at 32 as he was at 35 as I'm guessing he is now in his mid-40s based on what I've heard about him from others. His constant hyper sexualization of me totally ruined my libido and has caused long term damage that I'm still getting over many years later. It is fixible, and I have gotten better, but even now I'm realizing certain reactions of mine are coming from that experience that I never even realized. I won't put a label on it but this behavior is absolutely potentially damaging to your long term mental and sexual health. Probably physical health too if you keep him on as a partner because he absolutely will make any health crisis more about him and his dick (which, having been there, really makes the whole thing harder).\n\nGuys like him intentionally date younger because younger women tend to not be able to parse out exactly what we're worth and what is appropriate behavior the same way a woman in their 30s can. Definitely not all guys who are dating someone who is 7 years younger are like this, but this guy just outed himself as someone who is dating you for your body and not for your personhood. Anyone who can get genuinely aroused when their partner is that distressed and lacks the tact to know *you should shut up and never tell people especially them about it* is basically incapable of being a good partner to you long term.\n\nEdit to add: Absolutely NTA, and please take this as the sign it is.", "I wonder if presenting a scenario lump on his testicle and him asking you to feel it and him getting same response back that he gave you will make him realise how insensitive that is.

I would be very upset also. Last time i had found a lump both me and hubby were feeling it out and mildly freaking out together. I dont think its ever ok to minimise your partners worry on something like this. \n\nNTA. But you need to have deeper conversations on expectations, future and everything else.

I couldn\u2019t imagine any half decent man saying this.", "Absolutely NTA. When you go through something like this, the beginning stages are some of the most terrifying. You haven't even been to see a doctor yet and your mind spirals into all the darkest situations possible and you need support surrounding you. Your bf should be at the very top of that list, taking it seriously, listening to how it makes you feel, providing comfort and reassuring you that you're going to go through all of this together, no matter what news you get. He should have been focused on being a source of comfort for you. Instead, he focused on his own pleasure, which is an extremely weird reaction. *Especially* since he knows it runs in your family. \n\nWhen one of my best friends found a lump, she immediately got in her car and drove over to my house. I sat with her and asked her what she needed. Did she need to talk? Did she need me to simply listen? Did she need to emotionally let loose and go throw plates at a wall? Did she need to watch her favorite movies and eat her favorite meal? I was down for any and all of it and I made sure she knew I was in it for the long haul. While the news worried and, to be honest, flat out scared me (it also runs in her family and her aunt passed away 9 days before my friend finding the lump in her own breast. This was a fresh trauma, as it was.) it wasn't about me. It was about being there for her and just providing support. And she's just one of my closest friends! If she had been my partner?? I mean ... The person who's going through life by your side, they should be sharing that life, fully. And that means supporting one another though painful, terrifying, horrible, special and wonderful times. All of them. \n\nAgain: Huge NTA. I hope he realizes how much he needs to grow up and that he can change and learn from this experience. If not, as hard as it is, find someone who will be your true ride or die. \n\nI wish you all the luck in the world, OP.

NTA!!!  Heaven forbid something were to happen to you, your partner should be supportive.  What he said is not OK. After 4 years with you, he should understand how you would be scared. Rethinking is the right thing to do.", "NTA but you need to evaluate how you feel about the relationship before the comment. 4 years is something and more than enough to know if he was just feeling awkward and trying to lighten the air or if he's just an inconsiderate asshole.

Good luck OP,  Godspeed.", "NTA. To use an exaggerated comparison, it'd be kind of like him saying \"you're hot when you sulk\" while you were mourning the loss of a friend.\n\nNot necessarily the creepiness of it but the lack of understanding and respect for what you're going through.", "NTA he knew you had a family history cancer and still made that crass statement.

But I lack one critical information to assess both your and your boyfriends reaction. Does he know, that you have a family history of breast cancer? If he does he is an asshole. If he doesn't you overreacted a silly attempt of a bad joke, that was supposed to decrease your stress and lower your anxiety.", "NTA. But it was indeed an overreaction. The thing is that we cant tell you what you need to hear because we dont know what kind of man your boyfriend is....\n\nBut I can say that men can just be absolutely stupid sometimes without any malicious intents behind it. Finding you hot whilst you touch yourself doesn't mean he doesnt care.\n\nMy boyfriend for instance is the one with a list of health issues, several of which could end up life threatening and he jokes about it quite often. I tell him its not funny almost every day. Other times i go along with it, because worrying doesn't really change the reality.\n\nPeople dont always jump to the worst conclusions and they can handle serious situations differently than the norm. It doesn't make them assholes and it doesn't make you one for not agreeing to it.\n\nBut if he is generally a good guy, it was probably just a harmless reaction with a bad timing. In which case you should forgive the fact that he finds you attractive ;)\nIf he generally doest care about your issues and this situation is no change, then yes - he is an AH.", "It was very immature of him to not think of your real concerns and for him to not be concerned as well.

IMO to go to immediate grounds for breakup without a convo is probably why he thinks it\u2019s an overreaction..you guys hadn\u2019t t even spoken about it to get to that conclusion..he probably thought he was being cute/flirty but it just wasn\u2019t the time and it made you feel uncomfortable, disregarded and cheap. He needs to own up for that and have one opportunity to learn from it. In long term relationships both parties will inevitably offend each other that\u2019s how you learn what boundaries there are. Some are basic and shouldn\u2019t have to be explained (grounds for breakup) and some are not so cut and dry. It\u2019s up to you entirely..if he has a habit of making things that are important to you seem small Or thinking with his d!ck then that\u2019s a personality issue, but if it\u2019s a one off, have a conversation.", "NTA  however as a dude in that age range, and having experienced a handful of extremely stressful situations,  i wouldnt write off a poor stress response.

I come in peace.", "Kinda ESH? \n\ni am 100% on your side that he didn't take your fear seriously and that it was an ah thing to say that he's turned on when you are feeling your breasts for possible cancer. \n\nYou however went nuclear with the \"we need to overthink the relationship\".

But stating it out loud?  Kind of inappropriate, under the circumstance.\n\nOn the other hand, you thinking his comment was about his dick is a bit out there, too.
