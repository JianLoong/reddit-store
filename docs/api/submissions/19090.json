We split when I discovered he was having an affair  about 5 months ago.   I am currently 6 months pregnant with our first child. Alex and his AP, Angela (20sF), are now together.  \n\n\n  \nI met Alex 6 years ago at work.  He got a promotion that took him to the other side of the US a year into our relationship.  We did the long distance thing and then I joined him in our current city.  We got married last May.  Alex and I disagreed about when to start trying for a baby and decided to split the difference between this summer when I wanted and right after the wedding.  I ended up getting pregnant pretty quickly.\n\n  \nWhat I didn\u2019t know was that Alex and Angela, his coworker, had started an affair 2 years ago.  I did not suspect a thing and didn\u2019t even know she existed in any capacity until I discovered the affair in January. I left our home the day I discovered the affair and was lucky enough to be able to move in with my brother\u2019s best friend, Will (33M) who also happens to live in my current city. Alex begged me to come home and \u201cmake it work.\u201d I absolutely refused.  \n \n\n  \nI know that my ex is my child\u2019s father and will have rights to the baby but I do not believe he has a right to me while I am pregnant and this is where I might be the AH. When we split, I was newly pregnant, scared and he asked to be allowed to come to appointments.  My first appointment was about 2 weeks after i found out about the cheating and I allowed him to come, it was the most stressful hour of my life.  I had so many emotions and thoughts racing through my head, including anger that I was even in this position. The realization that I could have avoided being tied to my ex forever had I found out about the affair a month earlier, just made me hate this whole thing even more.  I went home from the appointment and just cried.  Will was comforting me and promised to accompany me to all my appointments if I wanted him to and this has been our arrangement for the last 5 months.  I am very grateful to Will and while our relationship is complicated, it is no longer platonic.   \n\n\n  \nAlex has been given updates throughout the pregnancy but I have not allowed him to attend any more appointments.  I do not want him there as it is really stressful for me.  He has also recently learned that Will is more than just my escort to my appointments and is not happy. He will not be in the delivery room either in case that matters. He has been calling members of our families and telling them that I am denying him access to the baby and that he is missing out on all of these moments. He feels like I am being petty and punishing him for cheating. He is requesting access to my belly-his words- so he can \u201cbond\u201d with the baby. I said no, some people think he should be able to experience some of these things while others side with me.  I will not be denying him access the baby.   \nSo AITA for keeping my ex away while I am pregnant?", "created_utc": 1686014339, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141yvra/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_my_ex_time_with_our_kid/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a fetus. And until it is outside of your body it remains a fetus and not a baby. He can have access to the baby when it exists. Until then, who you bring to your private medical appointments is none of his business.", "Until your child is born, no one has the right to attend any appointment or the birth.  Your ex can meet his child after you have been taken care of.  It is good of you to keep him updated, this may help in the co-parenting.  If you decide to breast feed - he is not entitled to watch either\n\n.", "NTA. But as soon as he gets to take that kid for a visit,  he will be GONE. Line up your lawyer, now.", "NTA\n\nBy all means give him pics from scans and keep him updated, but he chose to have an affair. He chose to be with someone else while trying for a baby. He is an adult and knew what he was doing. Actions have consequences.\nYour pregnancy should be as low-stress as possible for the sake of your health and that of your child. If you are unhappy to have him around then that is your right. He will have plenty of time to bond with his child, it doesn't have to be in the womb. \nSide note; make sure he knows your relationship status is none of his business. He has absolutely no rights to you, your body, or to making decisions on your behalf. Unless your child is at risk, it's literally none of his business.", "Access to your belly...that is...not a thing. \n\nBut I agree with so many here that suggest getting custody, visitation, child support squared away ASAP. This guy is very demanding and entitled, so I'd get the best lawyer you can afford and let them kick some a@@ in court. \n\nNTA", "NTA. A pregnancy is a medical event that you are experiencing. You are not an incubator, you are a living person with the medical right to control your own appointments. His presence actively works against your health. \n\nIf he wanted to be involved with the pregnancy he shouldn't have been an AH and a cheater. If I thought he should have any more kids I'd suggest you tell him to knock up Angela if he wants to be involved.", "Oh hell no. NTA.

You dont need to have him around or present for anything. \n\nBut once the kid is born\u2026 well, thats a matter for the courts.", "Hell no\u2026he can wait until after the baby is born. You need to be as stress free as possible during the pregnancy", "NTA-your body, your decision. \n\nAt this point, the appointments are your personal health records and no one should have access to your information unless you allow it.\n\nI seriously have never heard of a single belly-visitation request, although I would totally watch that episode of Court TV.", "NTA. At this point, it's your body and he lost any privileges to it when he shared his body with Angela.\n\nHe deserves updates and ultrasound pictures. That's it.\n\nHe doesn't have a right to be in the delivery room either.\n\nConsult a family lawyer to see about your rights for 100% custody while breastfeeding and, at what point, ex legally gets supervised and then unsupervised visits. Get child support and alimony.\n\nHe deserves to be punished. He's a cheater. And you aren't punishing him. You are doing what is right by your child by keeping the stress low.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nCustody and visitation will be handled after. He has a right to be in the kid's life. He has no right to be in yours. Basically, forget he exists, until the baby is born.", "NTA. He is not entitled to your pregnancy period. Please line up a lawyer before you give birth so this guy doesn\u2019t think he can just waltz in and take you child whenever he feels like it.", "NTA. You aren't together anymore, your health and the baby's must be your #1 priority: if that means you can't see him or be around him, so be it. Make sure you get a lawyer to work on your divorce papers and parental agreement asap. Don't leave this until after the baby is born as you won't have the time nor the patient for these things", "NTA. Your body is yours alone. He lost any privileges to share those moments with you once he decided to cheat. He can bond with your baby when they are born. You have boundaries he needs to respect now. Put your foot down now so you dont have these issues later on top of trying to co-parent.", "NTA - He revoked his right to be in your presence while pregnant when he cheated and lied. He created this, not you. You being stressed and having emotional pain in his presence is understandable and is not good for you or the baby. \n\nNow learn what your state requires re: custody (parenting) plans, child support while solidifying the divorce. He brought great pain and suffering into your life. Remember this when he deflects his actions to blaming you.", "No*, NTA. if he wanted to be present he wouldn't have fucked his coworker.

If he wanted to spend time with his unborn child he should have treated his baby\u2019s mom better. Bummer dude.", "NTA. When it involves your medical care and the birth itself, you are completely within your rights to not want him there. But I would proceed with caution and get legal advice now on how to deal with it. You are going to have to give him access to the baby once it is born and how you set this up can have lasting implications. I would get advice now so you know your rights and you don\u2019t end up starting your child\u2019s life with a messy battle.", "NTA-his actions have consequences. He is not being denied access to his own child, he is being denied access to you and your pregnancy. Whatever stress you feel and emotions you feel, so does the baby. This is not healthy for either the baby or you to endure this stress. So no, you are not TA. He is just trying to worm his way back in and using this as an excuse to create drama. Just ignore him and keep doing what you are until you have the baby. Then you can go to court and have the custody arrangements made from there and that would be the only time you would have to deal with him unless something happens to the baby/child while growing up. \n\nAlso you are going through separation and divorce at the same time , and idk what state you are in but you can also receive alimony for him having an affair. He created this mess, not you. He does not deserve access to anything but the baby when they are born.", "NTA you need to avoid high stress while pregnant . He does not have a right to you and he\u2019s the one who cheated and messed up. You aren\u2019t denying him access when the baby comes so that\u2019s what is important. When the baby comes go to court for custody it\u2019ll make it easier and avoid situations like this", "Absolutely NTA. The baby isn\u2019t here yet, so there\u2019s no way to deny him time with the baby. His argument is absurd. \n\nBut it does sound like it will be an uphill battle with him in regard to coparenting. I would contact an attorney now in order to get everything sorted for when baby is here.", "Sounds like he will be asserting rights to visitation. Contact a lawyer, keep records of everything, NTA for not letting him go to appointments or meeting you.", "you\u2019re a person, not an incubator. his parental rights start when the baby is born, not before. i\u2019m sorry this happened. nta.\n\neta: and when i say \u201cwhen the baby is born\u201d i in no way mean he should be with you when you give birth.", "I am not going to judge this. I absolutely cannot imagine what you are going through. Please ask your divorce lawyer what you need to do. Depending on the jurisdiction, it might be better for your impending custody agreement to work something out.\n\nBasically if I could kick the guy in the balls for you I would. But I really want you to not listen to the internet and call your lawyer asap. \n\nTexas, for example, has a family law code influenced by men\u2019s rights advocates that can be very pro sperm donor even when he is an abuser. I do NOT want you to do anything now he might try to use against you later.", ">He has been calling members of our families and telling them that I am denying him access to the baby and that he is missing out on all of these moments.\n\nI guess he shouldn't have cheated. NTA.\n\n>He is requesting access to my belly-his words- so he can \u201cbond\u201d with the baby.\n\nI horked a little bit. No, he can't touch you! That's disgusting.", "Nta. I wouldn't let him see the baby until AFTER custody has been settled in court.", "NTA. Your body. Your choice. At this point, these are all medical procedures. Even the birth is your medical procedure and he does not have to attend. His rights start once he establishes them. I\u2019d get all of this hammered out now so you don\u2019t have to deal with his controlling behavior later.", "NTA. He isn\u2019t legally entitled to any steps. It\u2019s his own fault. If he didn\u2019t have an affair, he wouldn\u2019t be alienated. You are well within your rights to keep your self away until the baby is born, and even then. Visitation can be conducted via third party communication. Stick to your guns and don\u2019t let him wear you down!", "That\u2019s quite a story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
