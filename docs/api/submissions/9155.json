We also never really visit her and my BIL, that place is like a kindergarden. \n\nMy sister is pissed that I never really spend time with them, but what is there to takk to them about? They're toddlers, and I don't wanna play with them eiter. My wife is the same, she doesn't even like to be referred to as their aunt, since she isn't biologically.

It's not that you don't want to be a \"Fun Uncle\".  It's that you don't want to be a uncle at all.  That's the honest title you should have said.  No one's asking you to coach the soccer team, but there's a place between being super involved and telling them to go away when just saying \"Hi\" to you.  At this point it seems like you don't even consider them family by the way you were annoyed that your sister brings them to family events.  I guess in your view your sister and her family should be ostracized from the family.\n\nBut don't bother with the whole 5 to 8 years thing.  You've already set the tone, and they probably won't forget that anytime soon.  Why get to know someone who's made a point of putting them in their \"Place\" all their lives.\n\n\"My sister of course brings them to all the family gatherings\"  Sounds like you resent her for that.

Pick them up if they fell down.  I don't get this attitude that you are entitled to treat kids and family members rudely because you \"don't like kids\". Also, this idea that you will have a relationship with them when they are old enough to talk to is absurd. Relationships take time to build. You will always be \"that guy\" who ignores them and wants nothing to do with them to them. And any change in your attitude later will be met with suspicion and mistrust. And your wife saying she doesn't want to even be called their aunt since she isn't biologically? She's an ass too. You both sound extremely unpleasant to be around. Not wanting or liking kids is not an identity. It's a choice you're making. And that's fine.

I got a vasectomy 10 years ago, and I still get it checked yearly. I'm not one of those \"I like kids, I just don't want them\" people, I can't stand kids, especially little ones. My family to be fair doesn't pester us about it, mostly because reversing a vasestomy at this point probably wouldn't work. My sister (26f) has two children (6f) (2m) who act their age.\n\nThis means I don't interact with them too much. They're loud, they're messy, and they don't always listen. My sister of course brings them to all the family gatherings, so we don't stay at those as long as we used to. We also never really visit her and my BIL, that place is like a kindergarden. \n\nMy sister is pissed that I never really spend time with them, but what is there to takk to them about? They're toddlers, and I don't wanna play with them eiter. My wife is the same, she doesn't even like to be referred to as their aunt, since she isn't biologically. My neice tries to go up and talk to me sometimes, and I usually just tell her to go see somebody else, since I'm busy. I do plan to have more of a relationship with them, I'm just waiting another 5-8 years so we I know how to have a conversation with them.\n\nAt christmas my sister got pissed when I didn't want to watch the youngest while she went to the bathroom, and said her kids don't even think of me as a uncle, I'm just that guy. I told her yeah, I don't wanna be a fun uncle, and she shouldn't have had kids if she had them under the assumption that I would be. She left and blocked my number, and now the whole family is pissed at me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That title needs fixing.\n\nYou can dislike kids all you want, but you shouldn't be surprised if your sister cuts off contact over your behaviour towards her and her family.

It's not like you gotta play with her, just make sure she doesn't get hurt.
