I met her a year or two later. I lost my mom not long after I met Janet. She and my dad quickly got engaged and married. I have two half siblings from them. I see my maternal family occasionally but we're close. I love my half siblings too. Janet I'm very meh about.\n\nSo my mom's family make this specific cake for everyone in the family's birthday. I learned how to make it when mom was still alive and the two of us would make it for my birthday and hers. After she died my grandparents would make it for me and I'd help them make it for others in the family whenever I was with them.\n\nFor some reason dad mentioned the cake to Janet a couple of years ago and then they told my half siblings about it. My half siblings wondered if it was the same kind of cakes they got and Janet was like no, it's a special one and we don't know what it is. My half siblings have asked on and off for the cake ever since and have been upset some birthdays when they ask if it's the one and Janet or my dad tell them no.\n\nThere has been some pressure on me, mostly from Janet but some from my dad, to make the cake for my half siblings birthdays from here out. I have refused to do so because it's something for my maternal side I feel like and it's not like my half siblings don't get cake. They just don't get the cake I get from my maternal family.\n\nJanet said I either love my siblings or I don't but I can't love them and not include them in something I love so much. She said I am showing my siblings I don't want them to be my siblings really. My dad said it would be such a loving thing to do. And that my siblings would think I hung the moon and stars if I included them in something like that. \n\nI told him and Janet to create their own recipe or to find one and use that as this family tradition.\n\nBut they say I should be willing to make this specific cake for my siblings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695127455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mpzwa/aita_for_not_making_a_specific_cake_from_my/", "score": 851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m being facetious but just to try to make the point. \n\nYour siblings will not doubt have lots of other things and shared experiences from their side that are perhaps taken for granted and so highlighted to you. \n\nThis just reeks of entitlement from your step mother and I\u2019d stay strong and not back down on this one. Don\u2019t let her or your dad bully you into submission and when your half siblings are old enough just explain. If they don\u2019t get it, then they don\u2019t deserve the cake anyway.", "NTA. you cannot force this kind of thing - an offering and gift from the heart must be genuinely intended.

The fact your dad and Janet keep emphasizing it's not the cake males them jerks as they could have said no this is OUR family's special cake.

It sound to me you would feel like you water down the importance of the cake if you\u2018d shared it and that totally valid! \n\nYour dad/stepmom really should go and buy/make a super extravagant cake and say thats their special cake now, you could pretend like its even better than yours OR just make a random ass cake so the  are satisfied\u2026 but of course your not obligated to do so OR make it for them hell nah NTA", "Nta. \nIf it was me, I would look your dad straight in the eyes and say that your mom is not Janet and they have no right to steal something special that your mom gave you.

Every time she or your dad bring the situation up\u2026don\u2019t argue..just sigh and say it\u2019s their duty to create cakes and traditions with their children.

Honestly, if someone I liked tried a piece of my cake, loved it and asked for the recipe, I\u2019d give it to them. I haven\u2019t ever seen the point of secret recipes, personally. Maybe you could bring them back a slice some time when you come home from your maternal family or give them the recipe so they can try it at least? So you\u2019re not making it for them for their bday, which is the tradition, but they can still see if they like it.\n\nIdk, it just seems weird to have this cake be so much of a secret that they can\u2019t even try it or know the flavor when you like them and they\u2019re asking about it", "NTA\n\nFind a different recipe and make it their cake, start a new tradition.m\n\nEdit: sorry, I was parroting u/forsaken-teaching756", "NTA \u201cThis is grief cake.

Whether or not you decide to create a new tradition with your siblings, that's an excellent point to bring up if it comes up again.

The cake isn't just some regular snack, it is a tradition,  handed down from a family they don't know. So you are going to respect that, and only share it with them when you are all adults. Let them know you love them very much and you look forward to sharing that part of yourself when they're older.

The funny thing is that Janet is probably only harassing and guilt-tripping you to make the cake because you refuse. It's a control thing. So, make up a special cake just for your half siblings, and when Janet asks/tells you to make \"your special cake\" cheerfully make the new cake.

You are free to keep things for yourself but like I replied above, if I am the siblings I feel unimportant to you. I'm sure this comes out in other areas of the relationship as well.

I can see not sharing the recipe, but the cake?\n\nAlso, whoever put this on those kids is an AH. Parents telling their kids things that other people have to deliver and then being mad at the other people when they don't because \"but I told my kids\".  Well, tell them that you're a lying AH, because you told them something you can't deliver.  So, I'll happily hang an AH on Janet, too, for putting you in this position with those kids but now that you're there... the way out is easy.\n\nAgain, I have half siblings on my dad's side. I never took them to my maternal grandmothers family for anything, although, they did meet at times. However, I never even would have had to ask if they were welcome or I could bring them or if they could stay. They are my \"half\", but that's never been a thing with us we don't do half. So, to a degree, I'll agree with Janet on that point, you can't say you love them and be willing to be shitty over a cake, ffs. \n\nETA- and my mother was always very sweet to those kids and asked after them when she knew I'd seen them.", "It's not uncommon here. Like mom's vs dad's family. Kids of divorce usually have two families. Sometimes people are all one big blended family.

If your dad and step mom and can\u2019t respect your boundaries, then I would just stop baking cakes for now. Your mom is gone and if keeping this tradition makes you feel like you\u2019re keeping her memory alive, then you shouldn\u2019t change anything.

No reason the parents can't find a freaking cake to make their kids.", "6 or 7 and 5 (my bad, i wrote the wrong age, that's when the parents divorced) are not that apart in a child development stage. It doesn't change the rest of the questions. Thinking your 7-year-old can see that mommy is sad and understanding why (the deeper reasons, not just the child-version) is ... well, not every child can handle the complex nature of adult relationships. \n\nMaybe it is cultural, maybe this sort of possessive and territorial behavior is something she learned from the mother. I find it strange, but there are different people with different customs. \n\nI still think that making the cake (even only once!) for her siblings now will show them she accepts them as real siblings, while if she doesn't that will make it very clear no matter what she is saying with words, her actions are different.", "I agree.  I think it is unkind to suggest that someone is obliged to share something important to them. The cake is reserved for the maternal side.  The OP has no duty to share it elsewhere.", "I'm a child of divorce and I know lots of other kids of divorce. It's not uncommon to have two entirely separate families and things you would not share with the other side. It could be cultural.

But that was really uncommon in my experience.", "I am a child of divorce too and I understand this sentiment, however her mom passed away when she was 6/7 years old and ever since she has lived only with her dad and visiting the mother's side on special occasions. The experience of how these family treat each other is of course very different. The point is about how she is treating her siblings that she lives full times with. \n\nI agree that the stepmom is AH for stressing to her children about that the cake is special, but at the end it sounds to me (and considering OP hasn't written down the current ages of anyone - not her and not her siblings) as if she is telling a bunch of children much younger than herself \"You will never understand how special this is and that's why I won't share it with you\".", "NTA.

Then next sibling\u2019s birthday ask if they want the maternal cake or a cake flavour of their own choosing. \n\nIn fact, start with Janet\u2019s birthday, bake her the \u201cmaternal\u201d cake, have a blast making a deliberately average-to-terrible cake. Pastry shortening instead of butter, no vanilla, salt, or other flavourings, water instead of milk.\n\nThen offer the siblings a birthday cake flavour of their choosing.", "Also, you can make a change to the recipe, so that it is not the EXACT cake, and no one but you will know. The only rule you might want to have is that your dad and Janet can't have any.", "You should definitely customize a recipe to be your special sibling cake! Before I became allergic to gluten I would make this chocolate cake that everyone loved. I made it my own by substituting ingredients from a Betty Crocker recipe and adding melted chocolate and Coca Cola.

For their birthday (twins) I started to make them a peanutbutter and chocolate cake. Chocolate cake, with peanutbutter icing. It's *fabulous* and kids LOVE it. They're grown men now and they still ask me for it. The cake is a basic German chocolate cake and the icing is literally just peanutbutter + icing sugar + some milk.\n\nAnd if peanutbutter is a no go, another one that kids love is what we call \"the funky monkey\", it's a vanilla cake with banana flavoring and banana cream icing. Decorate with more banana but only decorate right before serving because of the bananas browning!", "This is perfect", "Of course this sub thinks step and half families are the worst as usual.\n\nOP YTA.  This is the exact same dumb shit (but worse, because you claim to care about your half-siblings) as somebody at work not sharing a recipe because they want to hoard it for themselves or their family.\n\nFine, don't make it, but at least give the recipe.  Jesus, this shit isn't hard.", "NTA. Make a super special super secret siblings cake and tell them it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d so they stop asking for your maternal side\u2019s cake.

Does she expect you to take them on dates with you?  If you love running, do you have to give it up because they can't run as far or as fast as you can?  Or are you required to slow down to a fast walk so they can keep up?  Janet is caught in the trope of the perfect blended family.  Tell your father to deal with her and put a stop to her trying to include her kids in a tradition from your mother's side of the family.

Watch step mom's head explode.", "YANTAH \n\nI Guess Janet has never heard of a family recipe. I\u2019d also guess that, using Janet\u2019s logic, she doesn\u2019t love you; based on the \u201cyou either love your sibs or you don\u2019t\u201d logic. \n\nTalk with someone on your mom\u2019s side of the family that you trust if they think the recipe should stay with them or if they think it would be ok to share it. To me, it sounds like you don\u2019t want to seem like you\u2019re disrespecting your mother\u2019s memory. Discussing it with a member of that side of the family will let you hear opinions from people who aren\u2019t invested in your dad and step-mom but are invested in you. Sometimes internalizing these conversations lets you hear it differently and either see things differently or understand better why you feel the way that you do.", "NTA, but you have an opportunity here.

Not to be a jerk to your step mom but maybe a little.", "Nta. Make them a box cake and dress it up like the real one.", "Personally I would make the cake for Janet\u2019s birthday but add a lot of baking soda to the recipe to make it inedible.   Use weaponized incompetence.   Make the birthday cake with extra extra baking soda two years in a row and I guarantee she won\u2019t be asking you to bake that special cake again.  Your step-mother is a manipulative and controlling witch.  \n\nFor your half siblings, like a lot of posters have already recommended, create a sibling cake that is yummy!", "Let\u2019s say your mom\u2019s last name is Jackson.  Tell your dad and step-mom that your maternal family said it\u2019s a Jackson family recipe and is only made for people who are invited to Jackson family holiday dinners.   You cannot go against the words of your elders.   That should shut up Janet and your dad really fast.", "NTA\n\nYou could start a new tradition with them though, and find a special cake just for them.

(the flavours they make for the actual cakes are crazy) and some baking shows and make notes of your favourite ideas, do a few trial runs of cupcake sized ones (big batch of the basic mix then split it up to add different things to), keep a scrapbook of the process, and make the invention of the cake a story that you'll all be telling when you're teaching the recipe to two generations from now :) That way you can tell stepmum you're sharing the idea of a family cake with them, but it's a cake for their family- them and their big sibling- not some other family's cake that they're tacked onto as an afterthought. Operation Cake!", "NTA, but i see their point. For you its special and its your mom\u2019s family. If your dad and janet were not pressuring you, its likely that you would at least share the cake with your half siblings so they can experience it. \n\nBut it is my firm belief that when it is YOUR birthday, you get to choose the cake. If i were you i would talk to my siblings directly. What kind of cake do they want for THEIR birthday?", "NTA. How much you love anyone has nothing to do with a damn cake. Will they love you less if you don\u2019t make the cake? I\u2019d explain to the siblings how this is something between your mom and you. Yes it is special, but it reminds you of your time with your mom. Hopefully they can understand. Sounds like probably not with Janet sticking her nose in it all. \n\nI\u2019d find something else and make it. Don\u2019t leave it up to Janet for a new family cake. Have your siblings give some input and find something you can make together. For the three of you on your birthdays. (Tell Janet to fuck off. Ok, not really on the last part)", "NTA - Go the other way, ultimate wholesome petty :\n\nTalk to your siblings about the flavours/decoration/style that you all like (bonus if there's anything Janet doesn't like). Create a cake recipe with them, real bonding experience. Call it *Sibling Cake*  and see if you can keep it just between the three(+) of you. You always make it together, or two of you for the third maybe. It's for their/your birthdays. Not hers\n\nScrew you Janet. That cake is a special way for you and your grandparents bond and to remember your mum. She might have been invited one day, if it wasn't in her nature to passive aggressively try and horn in.", "Your dad and stepmom are LAZY.\n\nNeither want to do the work in creating a new family tradition, let alone including your stepsiblings in the process. \n\nThey use manipulation and threats to get their way. Yes threats, cause who's going to tell the stepsiblings you don't love them.... your stepmom. No wonder why you feel \"eh\" about her. \n\nBasically they want to steal your paternal side traditional cake that you have every right to keep on just that side of the family.  Obviously you never made that cake for your dad's mom or his siblings. The nerve of wanting it now. \n\nNo, you're not willing.  If you were willing you'd have already done so years ago and this would not be a discussion now.\n\nGood for you telling your dad and janet to creste their own traditional cake recipe. \n\nIf they need help because off \"weaponized cluelessness\" combine cakes that your siblings like.  \n\nFor instance, chocolate on the bottom, cherry filling in the middle, white cake on top, with swirled chocolate vanilla frosting. Cherry filling will be unique in that most bakeries don't do that. \n\nIf they like pudding, make a pudding cake  with chopped brownies folded in the dough.\n\nDon't be pressured to use your family recipes. Work with your siblings to create their own unique cake. They'll love it more that you helped them create a \"signature cake\". Also give each a copy of the recipe on a recipe card.\n\nNTA", "Do your siblings even know what kind of cake it is? It sounds like they only want it because someone told them it was \"special.\" If that's the case, find a different recipe and give it to Janet. She's the mother, after all.

It is clear to me that you love your own kids more than you love me, your stepchild, if you love me at all. You're supposed to love us equally. Since you don't  and keep pitting us siblings against each other, I will not make that special cake that is from MY maternal side of the family.
